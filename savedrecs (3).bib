Abstract = {{The concrete pore solution changes during chloride transfer due to the
   species leaching and the dissolution/precipitation of compounds. The
   latter could affect the material porosity and the chloride diffusion
   coefficient. In order to quantify these changes, the global movement of
   species was monitored on blended cement materials during a chloride
   migration test. Compartment solutions and sample pore solutions were
   analyzed in order to quantify the ion exchange balance. Two migration
   test protocols were carried out using (i) NaOH, KOH and NaCl, and (ii)
   synthetic seawater and synthetic pore solution. The use of slag reduces
   the free chloride in the porosity by about 9 times. For the Portland
   cement material, a precipitation of 0.3\%wt of Na, 0.6\%wt of K and
   1\%wt of Cl participated in a porosity clogging of 60\%. Finally, the
   materials with mineral additions reduce the portlandite dissolution
   during chloride transfer and the calcium leaching phenomena up to 26\%.}},

Abstract = {{A set of ICP-AES techniques has been developed for determination of
   rated elements: Ti, Si, P, Al, Cu, Mo, V, Sn, and Zr in ferrotitanium;
   Ni, Fe, Cu, Co, and As in ferronickel; Si, Cr, and P in ferrochrome
   silicon; Zr, Si, Al, P, and Cu in zirconium ferrosilicon; Mn, Si, and P
   in manganese ferrosilicon. Combination of the multielement ICP-AES
   method which allows precise determination of the elements in ferroalloys
   in a wide range of concentrations and the microwave preparation of
   samples in closed autoclaves which excludes the loss of the components
   to be determined provides the rapidity of the analysis procedure. The
   composition of solutions for opening samples of ferroalloys and the
   temperature-time modes of microwave sample preparation in an autoclave
   are substantiated. Conditions for ICP-AES determination of the rated
   elements in ferroalloys are studied. Analytical lines of the elements to
   be determined free from significant spectral overlaps are chosen. The
   dilution rates of the solutions are determined. The method of internal
   standard was used to improve the reproducibility of the analytical
   signal for Ti determination in ferrotitanium, Si and Cr in ferrochrome
   silicon, and all rated elements in manganese ferrosilicon and
   ferronickel. The spectrometer was calibrated using model solutions and
   solutions of standard samples with additions of the certified solutions
   of the elements to be determined. To determine Ti, Si, P, Al, Cu, V, and
   Zr in ferrotitanium; Ni, Fe, Cu, and Co in ferronickel; Si, Cr, and P in
   ferrochrome silicon; Zr, Si, Al, P, and Cu in zirconium ferrosilicon; Si
   and P in manganese ferrosilicon, a multidimensional graduation by two
   analytical lines was used. The correctness of the determination was
   evaluated in analysis of standard samples of ferroalloys and comparative
   analysis of the obtained results with the data of standard methods:
   comparison of the variances according to the Fisher criterion did not
   reveal any significant difference between them, whereas the use of the
   modified Student test showed the absence of a systematic error.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of diabetes mellitus is increasing due to the eating and
   living habits of modern people. As the disease progresses, the long-term
   effects of diabetes can cause microvascular disease, causing dysfunction
   in different parts of the body, which, in turn, leads to different
   complications, such as diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and
   diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is the main cause of vision loss and
   blindness in diabetic patients. Persistent hyperglycemia may cause
   damage to the retina, induce the accumulation of inflammatory factors,
   and destroy the blood-retinal barrier function. Fucoxanthin (Fx) is a
   marine carotenoid extracted from seaweed. It accounts for more than 10\%
   of the total carotenoids in nature. Fx is mainly found in brown algae
   and has strong antioxidant properties, due to its unique biologically
   active structure. This carotenoid also has the effects of reducing lipid
   peroxidation, reducing DNA damage, and preventing cardiovascular
   diseases as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects. However,
   there is no relevant research on the protective effect of Fx in DR.
   Therefore, in this study, we explore the protective effect of Fx on the
   retina. Human retinal epithelial cells (ARPE-19) are used to investigate
   the protective effect of Fx on high glucose stress- (glucose 75 mM) and
   high lipid peroxidation stress (4-hydroxynonenal, 4-HNE (30 mu
   M))-induced DR. The cell viability test shows that Fx recovered the cell
   damage, and Western blotting shows that Fx reduced the inflammation
   response and maintained the integrity of the blood-retinal barrier by
   reducing its apoptosis and cell adhesion factor protein expression.
   Using an antioxidant enzyme assay kit, we find that the protective
   effect of Fx may be related to the strong antioxidant properties of Fx,
   which increases catalase and reduces oxidative stress to produce a
   protective effect on the retina.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous fouling and pore wetting of the membrane during membrane
   distillation (MD) is a major concern. In this work, an electrospun
   bilayer membrane for enhancing fouling and wetting resistance has been
   developed for treating hydraulic fracture-produced water (PW) by MD.
   These PWs can contain over 200,000 ppm total dissolved solids, organic
   compounds and surfactants. The membrane consists of an omniphobic
   surface that faces the permeate stream and a hydrophilic surface that
   faces the feed stream. The omniphobic surface was decorated by growing
   nanoparticles, followed by silanization to lower the surface energy. An
   epoxied zwitterionic polymer was grafted onto the membrane surface that
   faces the feed stream to form a tight antifouling hydration layer. The
   membrane was challenged with an aqueous NaCl solution containing sodium
   dodecyl sulfate (SDS), an ampholyte and crude oil. In the presence of
   SDS and crude oil, the membrane was stable and displayed salt rejection
   (>99.9\%). Further, the decrease was much less than the base
   polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) electrospun membrane. The membranes
   were also challenged with actual PW. Our results highlight the
   importance of tuning the properties of the membrane surface that faces
   the feed and permeate streams in order to maximize membrane stability,
   flux and salt rejection.}},

Abstract = {{Inverse planning is a method of radiotherapy treatment planning where
   the care team begins with the desired dose distribution satisfying
   prescribed clinical objectives, and then determines the treatment
   parameters that will achieve it. The variety in symmetry, form, and
   characteristics of the objective functions describing clinical criteria
   requires a flexible optimization approach in order to obtain optimized
   treatment plans. Therefore, we introduce and discuss a nonlinear
   optimization formulation called the split common coincidence point
   problem (SCCPP). We show that the SCCPP is a suitable formulation for
   the inverse planning optimization problem with the flexibility of
   accommodating several biological and/or physical clinical objectives.
   Also, we propose an iterative algorithm for approximating the solution
   of the SCCPP, and using Bregman techniques, we establish that the
   proposed algorithm converges to a solution of the SCCPP and to an
   extremum of the inverse planning optimization problem. We end with a
   note on useful insights on implementing the algorithm in a clinical
   setting.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The paper introduces a working prototype of an IoT system which controls
   natural and artificial light balance in combination with a dynamic
   shading system. The proposed solution adopts a scalable approach to
   smart system integration in buildings based on sensing and actuating
   nodes (Arduino-driven) and on a main unit (Raspberry-driven). A control
   App is developed to allow user interaction by setting seasonal automatic
   modes or manual functionalities. The required illuminance threshold may
   be changed, while the shading system acts in accordance with seasonal
   profiles in line with bioclimatic design principles. The control system
   adopts a fuzzy logic solution which is able to ensure fast control
   without high computational effort. Preliminary tests of the developed
   prototype are reported showing its main functionalities and its ability
   to maintain the required illuminance even in high variance conditions by
   adjusting both shading and lighting in less than 100 s. Currently, the
   solution has reached TRL 3.}},

   architecture of the industrial engineering curriculum is rigid but has
   the flexibility, at a holistic level, to manipulate micro-components

   system towards 100 \% renewable energy by 2050}},
Journal = {{FUTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{124}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A cost-optimised transition pathway towards 100 \% renewable energy was
   simulated for Finland. This transition was consistent with EU and
   international targets to achieve sstainability, while maintaining
   national competitiveness. Finland was divided into 7 regions that
   account for resource distribution and demand differences at high spatial
   and hourly time resolutions. Results indicate that levelised cost of
   electricity can decrease from 61 (sic)/MWh in 2015 to 53 (sic)/MWh in
   2050 and that levelised cost of heat can decrease from 29 (sic)/MWh to
   20 (sic)/MWh based on the assumptions used in this study. Transport
   sector costs decrease for most vehicle classes through electrification
   but increase marginally for classes that use bioenergy-based or
   sustainable synthetic fuels. Costs decrease through the adoption of
   flexible generation by several renewable energy technologies,
   intra-regional interconnections, and the use of low-cost energy storage
   solutions. Results show less need for combined heat and power plants as
   the electrification increases through sector integration. Individuals
   and groups can become prosumers of energy, motivated by a desire to
   contribute to climate action and making choices for lower cost,
   sustainable energy. Collectively, society can increase a sense of agency
   through lower exposure to risks. A 100 \% renewable energy system can be
   a resilient, low cost and low risk option for the future.}},

Title = {{RUNX1/ETO and mutant KIT both contribute to programming the
   transcriptional and chromatin landscape in t(8;21) acute myeloid
   leukemia}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL HEMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{62-74}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Acute myeloid leukemia development occurs in a stepwise fashion whereby
   an original driver mutation is followed by additional mutations. The
   first type of mutations tends to be in genes encoding members of the
   epigenetic/transcription regulatory machinery (i.e., RUNX1, DNMT3A,
   TET2), while the secondary mutations often involve genes encoding
   members of signaling pathways that cause uncontrolled growth of such
   cells such as the growth factor receptors c-KIT of FLT3. Patients
   usually present with both types of mutations, but it is currently
   unclear how both mutational events shape the epigenome in developing AML
   cells. To this end we generated an in vitro model of t (8;21) AML by
   expressing its driver oncoprotein RUNX1-ETO with or without a mutated
   (N822K) KIT protein. Expression of N822K-c-KIT strongly increases the
   self-renewal capacity of RUNX1-ETO-expressing cells. Global analysis of
   gene expression changes and alterations in the epigenome revealed that
   N822K-c-KIT expression profoundly influences the open chromatin
   landscape and transcription factor binding. However, our experiments
   also revealed that double mutant cells still differ from their
   patient-derived counterparts, highlighting the importance of studying
   patient cells to obtain a true picture of how gene regulatory networks
   have been reprogrammed during tumorigenesis. (C) 2020 ISEH - Society for

   by equating results with latest published approaches such as symbiotic
   organism search algorithm and articial bee colony tuned PID controller.
   Further, the suggested method is extended to a three unequal area
   thermal model and the performance of results are equated with
   teaching-learning based optimization-PIDD and firey algorithm-PID for
   the identical model. Lastly, the experiment of the proposed scheme has

Abstract = {{Background Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a commonly
   misdiagnosed cardiac condition due to low disease awareness and
   perceived rarity, which frequently results in incorrect management and
   poor outcomes. Early and prompt diagnosis has become critical with
   emerging therapies that improve patient survival.
   Case summary A 68-year-old woman presented to a tertiary care centre
   with acute decompensated heart failure following recurrent
   hospitalizations for the same issue over the past several months.
   Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe concentric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with grade III diastolic dysfunction. However,
   QRS voltage by 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was discordant with the
   degree of left ventricular hypertrophy seen by echocardiography, and the
   patient had recurrent non-sustained ventricular tachycardia that
   necessitated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation a few
   months prior. After aggressive diuresis, the patient completed cardiac
   magnetic resonance imaging that raised concern for cardiac amyloidosis.
   Subsequent serum and urine protein electrophoresis with associated
   immunofixation were within normal limits. Finally, ATTR-CM was confirmed
   by technetium-99m pyrophosphate scintigraphy with plans to initiate
   tafamidis after genetic testing.
   Discussion Patients >60 years of age with diastolic heart failure
   phenotypically similar to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and/or
   hypertensive heart disease should always be evaluated for ATTR-CM.
   Features that increase suspicion include discordance between left
   ventricular wall thickness and ECG voltage, and signs/symptoms of a
   primary peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. Useful non-invasive
   diagnostic testing has also made the diagnosis of ATTR-CM inexpensive
   and possible without the need for an endomyocardial biopsy.
   Unfortunately, this patient's diagnosis of ATTR-CM came late in her
   disease course, which delayed the onset of definitive therapy.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore the economic burdens of hip fracture surgery in
   patients referred to lower-level medical institutions and to evaluate
   how referral systems affect costs and outcomes of hip fracture surgery.
   Design: A nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study.
   Setting: All hospitals in Taiwan. Participants: A total of 7500 patients
   who had received hip fracture surgery (International Classification of
   Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic codes
   820.0 similar to 820.9 and procedure codes 79.15, 79.35, 81.52, 81.53)
   performed in 1997 to 2013. Main outcome measures: Total costs including
   outpatient costs, inpatient costs and total medical costs and medical
   outcomes including 30-day readmission, 90-day readmission, infection,
   dislocation, revision and mortality.
   Results: The patients were referred to a lower medical institution after
   hip fracture surgery (downward referral group) and 3034 patients
   continued treatment at the same medical institution (non-referral
   group). Demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics and
   institutional characteristics were significantly associated with
   postoperative costs and outcomes (P < 0.05). On average, the annual
   healthcare cost was New Taiwan Dollars (NT\$)2262 per patient lower in
   the downward referral group compared with the non-referral group. The
   annual economic burdens of the downward referral group approximated
   NT\$241 million (2019 exchange rate, NT\$30.5= US\$1).
   Conclusions: Postoperative costs and outcomes of hip fracture surgery
   are related not only to demographic and clinical characteristics, but
   also to institutional characteristics. The advantages of downward
   referral after hip fracture surgery can save huge medical costs and
   provide a useful reference for healthcare authorities when drafting
   policies for the referral system.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial properties in carbon fiber composites, which control the

   Effective interface enhancement work is conducted on the modification of

   surface modifications methods do have their own drawbacks such as high
   temperatures with a range of 600 similar to 1000 degrees C, which should

   is very fast and continuous and can disperse CNTs with random
   orientation in the interface resulting in enhanced interfacial
   properties. Scanning electron microscopy was conducted to investigate
   the CNT dispersion and composites morphology, and the thermal stability
   of the composites was analyzed via thermogravimetric analysis. In
   addition, fiber pull-out tests were used to assess interfacial strength
   between fiber and matrix.}},

Abstract = {{The host rock of the Usuki Stone Buddha Statues is dark gray welded tuff
   involved the Aso-4 pyroclastic flow sediments. This Buddha Statues are
   processing chlorosis from rainfall flowing above and underground water
   which were urgently needed for conservation measurement. White

   Buddha Statues are mainly consisted of thenardite, gypsum and dolomite.
   Extraction experiment result shows that thenardite was dissolved at the
   beginning of stirring and then redissolved after 4 hours, and gypsum was
   detected until stirring for 2 hours, and then dissolved after stirring
   for 4 hours. As a result of monitoring the microclimate environment for
   11 months to determine the recrystallization environment of white
   precipitates, the phase transition between thenadite and mirabilite
   appears widely in spring, and is maintained in an aqueous solution due
   to high temperatures in summer and fall. In winter, mirabilite is shown
   the widest by decreasing temperature. Therefore we requires details

Abstract = {{Background: This study is aimed to identify the muscles that need to be
   trained for high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation by evaluating the
   muscles that are fatigued during chest compression in both kneeling and
   standing positions.
   Methods: In this randomized crossover trial, 37 participants performed
   continuous chest compressions on a manikin for 5 min, alternating
   between kneeling and standing positions. The median frequency values of
   16 muscles were determined from surface electromyography recordings.
   Results: The median frequency values of the arm muscles (flexor carpi
   radialis, extensor carpi radialis, biceps brachii, triceps brachii) in
   both positions were significantly lower during the last 30 s than during
   the first 30 s, demonstrating muscle fatigue over time. The cervical
   erector spinae in the kneeling position and the external oblique
   abdominis in the standing position were also fatigued over time. In the
   deltoideus, quadriceps femoris, and biceps femoris muscles, the
   difference in median frequency between the last 30 s and the first 30 s
   was significantly different between the two positions, and muscles were
   more fatigued in the standing position than in the kneeling position.
   Conclusions: Understanding patterns of muscle fatigue and training of
   these muscles would assist healthcare providers in performing
   high-quality chest compressions. (C) 2020 College of Emergency Nursing

Abstract = {{Developed countries are becoming concerned with an increase in temporary
   workers, as it has undermined both their job security and the effects of
   collective action. China has experienced a surge of temporary work
   during the last three decades. Employing a cost and benefit analysis,
   this study identifies labor shortages and the weakness of job protection
   against arbitrary dismissal, both preconditions that have affected the
   collective-action preferences of temporary and permanent workers in
   China since 2010. Although the former has lowered the cost of collective
   action for temporary workers in China, the latter has increased the
   opportunity cost for permanent workers. Analyzing the Chinese General
   Social Survey in 2013, this study finds that temporary workers are twice
   as likely as permanent workers to actively join in collective action,
   suggesting that the prevalence of precarious work in China does not
   necessarily disempower Chinese workers.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates repertories of the Yiwangjik aakpu regular
   concert to examine how court musicians in colonial Korea reacted to the
   continuing influx of Western musical culture. The Yiwangjik aakpu was
   formerly the Changagwen in charge of music performed at the royal palace
   of Chosen Korea. The name change, along with a reduction in the number
   of affiliated musicians, occurred with the fall of the dynasty and the
   establishment of the Japanese colonial government. In the face of
   declining court music, court musicians established a training institute
   for younger generation court musicians and held monthly concerts from
   1932 to 1945 to preserve their music. They provided the public with
   opportunities to enroll at the training institute and watch the regular
   concerts. This article reveals that court musicians incorporated
   elements of Western classical music, which held a dominant position in
   the performing arts fields during the 1930s, into their concert programs
   in addition to promoting institutional changes. The court musicians' new
   attempts, beyond merely preserving an old tradition, demonstrate their
   adaptation to the rapidly changing musical culture of the time. These
   findings overall elaborate on the innovative and adaptive efforts of
   Korean court musicians, thereby expanding the range of prior studies on
   the Japanese colonial period.}},

Abstract = {{Fetal MRI is the modality of choice to study supratentorial brain
   malformations. To accurately interpret the MRI, the radiologist needs to
   understand the normal sequence of events that occurs during prenatal

   hemispheric cleavage, formation of interhemispheric commissures,
   neuro-glial proliferation and migration, and cortical folding.
   Disruption of these processes results in malformations observed on fetal
   MRI including holoprosencephaly, callosal agenesis, heterotopic gray
   matter, lissencephaly and other malformations of cortical development
   (focal cortical dysplasia, polymicrogyria). The radiologist should also
   be familiar with findings that have high association with specific
   conditions affecting the central nervous system or other organ systems.

Abstract = {{Nitrate (NO3-) contamination has dramatically increased owing to
   extensive human activities, which may cause severe problems on human
   health and the environment. Recently, catalytic denitrification of NO3-
   to N-2 has attracted much attention owing to its highly fast reaction
   with high N-2 selectivity. However, only a few studies have investigated
   the effect of natural substances in real groundwater on catalytic
   denitrification, particularly the type of natural organic matter (NOM)
   and combined effect of NOM and ionic ions. Herein, we investigated the
   effects of natural dissolved inorganic and organic matter on catalytic
   denitrification of contaminated groundwater using a novel Pd-In
   bimetallic catalyst supported on kaolin-derived zeolite (ZK). Pd-In/ZK
   showed a highly enhanced performance for denitrification, resulting in a
   high turnover frequency (18.9 x 10(-3) s(-1)) and N-2 selectivity
   (98\%). Various surface analyses confirmed that the rejuvenation of In
   by active H on Pd sites is the key factor that controls the enhanced
   NO3- reduction and high N-2 selectivity. Applying the optimized Pd-In/ZK
   catalyst to NO3- contaminated groundwater revealed that its catalytic
   activity was significantly affected by various constituents in
   groundwater. Particularly, the results from fluorescence excitation
   emission matrix spectroscopy showed that humic-like and fulvic-like
   organic substances potentially inhibited the catalytic NO3- reduction
   owing to their adsorption onto the catalyst surface. Furthermore, some
   inorganic ions inhibited the catalytic NO3- reduction via different
   inhibitory mechanisms, i.e. the competitive adsorption of Cl- and SO42-
   with NO3- and catalyst fouling induced by formation of CaCO3(s). The
   novel findings from this study highlight the potential applicability of
   ZK as a value-adding support material for catalytic denitrification and
   emphasize the effect of dissolved organic and inorganic matters in
   groundwater on the catalytic activity of bimetallic catalysts.}},

   inclusion criteria. Median age at admission was 9 years. Six of 32
   patients (19\%) were found to have first-degree AVB, with a median
   longest PR interval of 225 milliseconds (interquartile range 200-302),
   compared with 140 milliseconds (interquartile range 80-178) in patients
   without first-degree AVB. The onset of AVB occurred at a median of 8
   days after the initial symptoms and returned to normal 3 days
   thereafter. No patients developed advanced AVB, although 1 patient
   developed a PR interval >300 milliseconds. Another patient developed
   new-onset right bundle branch block, which resolved during
   hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes, inflammatory markers, and cardiac
   function were not associated with AVB development. CONCLUSIONS: In our
   population, there is a 19\% prevalence of first-degree AVB in patients
   with MIS-C. All patients with a prolonged PR interval recovered without
   progression to high-degree AVB. Patients admitted with MIS-C require
   close electrocardiogram monitoring during the acute phase.
   We report a series of pediatric patients with a novel finding of
   first-degree AVB associated with MIS-C.}},

Abstract = {{Aster scaber is a wild vegetable cultivated in Korea and is known to
   contain phytochemicals with various biological activities. The potential
   antioxidant and anti-obesity effects of A. scaber and their mechanism
   are yet to be reported. We evaluated the total phenolic, flavonoid, and
   proanthocyanidin contents and oxygen radical absorbance capacity of A.
   scaber ethanolic extract (ASE), and analyzed the major phenolic
   compounds of ASE. Antioxidant activity was measured at the chemical
   level through 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), reducing power
   assay, 2,2 `-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS),
   and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay. In
   addition, it was measured in vitro through inhibition of Reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) production in 3T3-L1 adipocyte, and inhibition of lipid
   accumulation was also evaluated. ASE reduced the expression of enzymes
   involved in the production of ROS and increased the expression of
   antioxidant enzymes that reduce increased ROS levels. They also reduced
   the expression of adipogenesis transcription factors that regulate
   adipocyte differentiation in relation to ROS production, inhibited the
   expression of lipogenesis-related genes related to fat accumulation
   through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, and increased
   expression of lipolysis-related genes. Thus, ASE containing CGA
   (chlorogenic acid) inhibits ROS production in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, owing
   to its strong antioxidant activity, and inhibits lipid accumulation
   caused by oxidative stress. The extract can be used as a potential
   functional food material for reducing oxidative stress and obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term
   patient experience with tetracycline injections for treatment of
   festoons.
   Methods: Charts of all patients undergoing tetracycline injection for
   treatment of lower eyelid festoons at the Cole Eye Institute, Cleveland
   Clinic, between 2008 and 2018 were identified using billing records.
   Patients were invited to participate in a questionnaire based on the
   FACE-Q checklist, a previously validated questionnaire for studying
   cosmetic procedure outcomes. Data from the questionnaire were summarized
   with size, mean, and frequency.
   Results: One hundred two patients who received tetracycline injection
   during the study period were identified and 61 responses were obtained.
   The average follow-up time after injection was 3.6 years. Of 61
   respondents, 36 (59 percent) noted improvement in their festoons after
   treatment, and 27 of 33 (82 percent) noted that improvement occurred
   within 2 months of treatment. Overall, 40 of 60 respondents (67 percent)
   would consider repeating tetracycline treatment. The most common adverse
   effects included discomfort (18 percent), swelling (15 percent), and
   bruising (13 percent). There was no statistically significant difference
   in questionnaire responses between men and women, except that men were
   more likely to consider repeated injection (92 percent versus 58
   percent; p = 0.005).
   Conclusion: Tetracycline injection appears to improve festoons in a
   majority of patients, with an acceptable side-effect profile, although
   more data are needed to determine the optimal dose and frequency and to
   identify possible rare and/or significant side effects.}},

Title = {{Characterization of Pseudotachylite and Fault Gouges in Drill Cores from
   Andong, Korea and Its Implications for Paleo-Earthquakes}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Pseudotachylite and fault gouges were observed in core samples of
   Precambrian granitic gneiss drilled from depths as great as 1000 m in
   Andong, Korea. Fault gouges were found in the upper parts of the
   borehole, whereas pseudotachylites developed in the lower parts.
   Pseudotachylite with widths varying from a few mm to 10 cm sharply
   contacted or were interlayered with the host rock. The quartz-rich
   portion of the granitic gneiss remained unaffected, but the mafic
   portion was melted preferentially. The glassy surface of pseudotachylite
   is characterized by a smooth, glassy matrix with an amorphous phase and
   silicate beads with diameters of similar to 200 nm, together with
   slickenlines. Slickenlines composed of parallel grooves showed a
   wavelength of 4-7 mu m and an amplitude < 1-2 mu m. Residual or
   surviving grains have rounded corners and edges, indicating that those
   grains experienced abrasion, possibly from grain rotation or shear
   stress. Both melting and crushing contribute to the formation of
   pseudotachylite. Fe was always enriched in the glassy matrix, indicating
   that the pseudotachylite matrix originated from mafic minerals. The
   occurrence of pseudotachylite related to paleo-earthquake events showed
   that crystalline rocks in this area are unsatisfactory candidates for
   deep-disposal sites for high-level nuclear waste.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presenting with macroscopic
   bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT) is an uncommon event. The role of a
   curative hepatic resection and associated long-term outcomes remain
   controversial. In addition the necessity for bile duct resection is
   still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of
   hepatectomy with a selective bile duct preservation approach for HCC
   with BDTT in comparison to outcomes without BDTT.
   Methods: A total of 22 HCC with BDTT patients who had undergone curative
   hepatic resection with a selective bile duct preservation approach at
   our institute were retrospectively reviewed. These were compared to
   group of 145 HCC without BDTT patients. The impact of curative surgical
   resection and BDTT on clinical outcomes and survival after surgical
   resection were analyzed.
   Results: All HCC with BDTT cases underwent major hepatectomy vs. 32.4\%
   in the comparative group. Bile duct preservation rate was 56.5\%. The
   1-, 3-and 5-year survival rates of HCC with BDTT patients in comparison
   to the HCC without BDTT group were 81.8\%, 52.8\% and 52.8\% vs. 73.6\%,
   55.6\% and 40.7\% (P=0.804) respectively. Positive resection margin,
   tumor size >= 5 cm and AFP >= 200 IU/mL were significant risk factors
   regarding overall survival. However, it is unclear whether presence of a
   bile duct tumor thrombus has an adverse impact on either recurrence free
   survival or overall survival.
   Conclusions: Bile duct obstruction from tumor thrombus did not
   necessarily indicate an advanced form of disease. Tumor size and AFP had
   greater impact on long-term outcomes than bile duct tumor thrombus.
   Major liver resection with a selective bile duct preserving approach in
   HCC with BDTT can achieve favorable outcomes comparable to those of HCC
   without BDTT in selected patients.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the experiment was to study the effect of pulsed
   ultrasound (PUS) on post-thoracotomy pain and local tissue temperature
   and to correlate the findings with the alteration in spinal
   anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Mechanical
   sensitivity, subcutaneous temperature and spinal interleukin-10 (IL-10),
   IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression were examined
   in a rat model of experimental post-thoracotomy pain. Group 1 received a
   sham surgery where thoracotomy was performed except for rib retraction.
   Group 2 underwent thoracotomy with rib retraction (TRR). Group 3
   received the TRR procedure followed by PUS. Group 4 underwent the TRR
   procedure followed by only the massage with the ultrasound turned off.
   Compared with group 1 (sham), groups 2-4 showed a decrease in mechanical
   withdrawal thresholds on postoperative days (PODs) 10 and 11. On PODs
   16, 23 and 30, group 3 (TRR+PUS-1) displayed an increase in mechanical
   withdrawal thresholds compared with groups 2 and 4. Subcutaneous and
   body temperatures in group 3 were not prominently different from group
   1, group 2 (TRR only) or group 4 (TRR+PUS-0). Compared with group 2,
   group 3 had an increase in spinal IL-10 level on POD 30 and a decrease
   in spinal IL-6 or TNF-alpha expression on PODs 16 and 30. We concluded
   that mechanical hypersensitivity after TRR is postponed by PUS, and its
   effect continues for 3 wk. A PUS dose not increase local tissue
   temperature. The beneficial effect of PUS appears related to
   upregulation of spinal anti-inflammatory cytokine and downregulation of
   spinal pro-inflammatory cytokines. (E-mail: chhung@mail.ncku.edu.tw) (C)

Title = {{Small molecule antagonist of C-C chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) reduces
   disc inflammation in the rabbit model}},
Journal = {{SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2025-2036}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Targeting chemokines or chemokine receptors is a
   promising treatment strategy for diseases with chronic inflammation such
   as rheumatoid arthritis and discogenic pain. Identifying specific
   molecules and determining their effectiveness in animal models are the
   first steps in developing these treatments. Macrophage markers have been
   detected in the intervertebral disc tissues of patients with disc
   degenerative disease and discogenic pain and in different animal models.
   Macrophage recruitment into the disc may play a role in initiation of
   inflammation and if unresolved may lead to chronic inflammation and
   subsequent back pain.
   PURPOSE: The objectives of these studies are to (1) identify chemokine
   receptor antagonists that can block macrophage migration induced by disc
   cells in vitro and (2) determine if intradiscal treatment with these
   antagonists can reduce disc inflammation and degeneration in vivo.
   STUDY DESIGN: In vitro migration assays were used to test effectiveness
   of chemokine receptor antagonists to block macrophage migration induced
   by disc cells. The rabbit annular puncture model was used to test for
   anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects of chemokine receptor
   antagonist treatment in vivo.
   METHODS: In vitro - THP-1 human monocytic cell line and freshly isolated
   rabbit primary splenocytes were assayed for migration using 3 mu m
   Corning Transwell inserts with conditioned media of interleukin (IL)-1
   beta treated human or rabbit disc cells. Inhibition of macrophage
   migration was evaluated using different concentrations of small molecule
   antagonists of C-C chemokine receptor (CCR)1 and CCR2. In vivo - New
   Zealand White rabbits (n=40) underwent disc puncture and intradiscal
   treatment with saline, CCR1 or CCR2 antagonists within the same
   procedure. X-ray and magnetic resonance (MR) images and serum samples
   were taken for disc height, MRI grade and IL-8 serum level analyses.
   Intervertebral discs were isolated for RNA analysis of inflammatory and
   disc phenotypic markers and for immunohistochemical analysis of
   macrophage marker, RAM11. The outcome measures were compared between the
   three treatment groups. These studies were funded by a research grant
   from AO Foundation, Switzerland (Project no S-14-86A; 120000 CHF). CCR1
   and CCR2 antagonists were kindly provided by ChemoCentryx (Mountain
   View, CA).
   RESULTS: In vitro migration assays showed that THP-1 migration induced
   by disc cells was blocked by CCR2 antagonist more effectively than CCR1
   antagonist, while rabbit splenocyte migration was inhibited by CCR1
   antagonist and not the other. In the rabbit annular puncture model,
   rabbit discs treated with CCR1 antagonist had significantly better MRI
   grades than those treated with CCR2 antagonist at 6 weeks
   post-treatment. Gene expression studies demonstrate that discs treated
   with CCR1 or CCR2 antagonists expressed less inflammatory markers than
   saline-treated discs at 3 weeks post-treatment. Although CCR2 antagonist
   treatment did not reduce inflammatory marker expression at 6 weeks,
   discs treated with CCR1 antagonist expressed less inflammatory markers
   and also a higher ratio of collagen type 2 to collagen type 1 genes
   indicating favorable disc matrix production. There were no significant
   differences between all three treatment groups in regards to disc height
   indexes, IL-8 serum levels or macrophage marker detection.
   CONCLUSIONS: These studies have identified that small molecule
   antagonists against CCR2 and CCR1 were respectively effective in
   blocking THP-1 and rabbit splenocyte migration induced by disc cells in
   vitro. Further, both CCR2 and CCR1 antagonist intradiscal treatments
   were effective in reducing disc inflammation at an early time point of 3
   weeks. Lastly, only CCR1 antagonist demonstrated anti-inflammatory
   effects and better MRI grades at 6 weeks.
   CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our preclinical studies demonstrate that CCR1 and
   CCR2 antagonist delivery through intradiscal injection is sufficient to
   reduce disc inflammation at early time points, whereas CCR1 antagonists
   had longer term anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical studies have found
   that CCR1 antagonist was safe, tolerable and clinically active in
   reducing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis patients. These studies
   suggest that CCR1 antagonist may be a promising biological treatment to
   reduce disc inflammation that translates to back pain relief. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Extended half-life (EHL) products have shown robust efficacy in clinical
   trials, whilst allowing for less intense treatment regimens when
   compared with standard half-life products. Regimen optimisation with EHL
   products could lead to further improvements in bleeding rates, quality
   of life and reductions in treatment burden. Patients now expect good
   efficacy, a lower treatment burden and equivalent safety when compared
   with standard halflife products. As our knowledge base grows these
   expectations have evolved and targeting an annualised bleeding rate of
   zero has become a more realistic clinical goal. Personalised prophylaxis
   can help patients achieve these goals. However, a number of challenges
   still remain, including cost, challenges in predicting outcomes for
   patients and differences in patients' and clinicians' expectations. When
   switching a patient, comprehensive patient care can reduce the impact of
   these issues. This review presents in brief the protein therapeutics
   with an extended half-life, including key trial results, challenges of
   chronic care that impact on patients' outcomes and how the modified
   proteins might help address some of these issues. In addition, practical
   steps for managing the switch to EHL products are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Insertions and deletions (indels) in protein sequences alter the residue
   spacing along the polypeptide backbone and consequently open up
   possibilities for tuning protein function in a way that is inaccessible

   computational protein redesign approach centered around predicting
   beneficial combinations of indels along with substitutions and also
   obtain putative substrate-docked structures for these protein variants.
   This modified algorithmic capability would be of interest for enzyme
   engineering and broadly inform other protein design tasks. We highlight
   this capability by (1) identifying active variants of a bacterial
   thioesterase enzyme ('TesA) with experimental corroboration, (2)
   recapitulating existing active TEM-1 beta-Lactamase sequences of
   different sizes, and (3) identifying shorter 4-Coumarate:CoA ligases
   with enhanced in vitro activities toward non-native substrates. A
   separate PyRosetta-based open-source tool, Indel-Maker

Abstract = {{Study designA cross-sectional radiological study.ObjectivesWe aimed to
   examine the degenerative changes of sagittal alignment in patients with
   Roussouly type 1.Summary of background dataRoussouly type 1 is unique in
   shape, characterized by short lumbar lordosis (LL) with the apex at L5
   and thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK). Because of the unique shape of
   sagittal alignment and the small pelvic incidence (PI) in Roussouly type
   1, the degenerative changes of sagittal alignment may differ.MethodsA
   total of 145 patients with Roussouly type 1 were recruited and
   distributed into three age groups; Group I (N=40) were young patients
   (20-40 years of age), Group II (N=47) were middle-aged patients (45-60
   years of age), and Group III (N=48) were elderly patients (>65 years of
   age). Sagittal parameters including sagittal vertical axis (SVA), PI,
   pelvic tilt (PT), L1S1 LL, L4S1 LL, thoracic kyphosis (TK), and TLK were
   measured using Surgimap((R)) software. The occurrence of lumbar
   retrolisthesis was also examined.ResultsThe SVA, PI, PT, L1S1 LL, L4S1
   LL, TK, and TLK in group I were -25.9 degrees 23.4 mm, 37.1 degrees 5.3
   degrees, 10.3 degrees +/- 5.5 degrees, 42.7 degrees +/- 8.8 degrees,
   35.5 degrees +/- 6.9 degrees, 29.5 degrees +/- 23.5 degrees, and 9.7
   degrees +/- 5.9 degrees, respectively. Among the Groups I, II, and III,
   there was a stepwise increase in the SVA, PT, TLK, and lumbar
   retrolisthesis (all P<0.001). The PI, L4S1 LL, and TK were identical
   among the three groups.ConclusionsDegenerative changes of Roussouly type
   1 include increase in the SVA, PT, TLK, and lumbar retrolisthesis, while
   the PI, L4S1 LL, and TK remain unchanged.Level of EvidenceLevel IV.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the mathematical model of the electrical and thermal
   processes proceeding during the electrosurgical polypectomy is
   considered. During a colonoscopy, the endoscopist can remove abnormal
   growths (polyps) inside the large intestine (the colon). In the
   electrosurgical polypectomy procedure, a polypectomy snare is tightened
   around the base of the polyp. Next, the electric current flows for a
   short moment of time from the snare loop (the first electrode), through
   the polyp-colon tissues and the other body tissues, to the second
   electrode placed on the patient's skin. Both electrodes are connected to
   the electrosurgical generator unit. This medical surgery allows to cut
   off the polyp stalk from the colon wall. The systems of the partial
   differential equations that describe the thermal and electrical
   processes with the appropriate initial-boundary conditions are proposed.
   The examples of numerical simulations related to two duty cycles of the
   electrosurgical generator unit are presented. Simulation results can be
   helpful for the surgeons to choose the optimal heating time and to set
   other parameters of the electric current that flows by tissues during
   the endoscopy procedure.}},

   intravenous paracetamol every 6 hours. Fentanyl consumption, Visual
   Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores, rescue analgesia, block procedure time,
   and side-effects were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Postoperative opioid consumption at all time intervals were
   significantly lower both in ESPB and mTLIP groups compared with the
   control group (P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed
   concerning intra- and postoperative opioid consumption between the ESPB
   and the mTLIP group (P < 0.001). Passive VAS score at the postanesthesia
   care unit, second, fourth, and eighth hours, and active VAS score at the
   postanesthesia care unit, second, fourth, eighth, and 16th hours were
   significantly lower in the ESPB and mTLIP groups compared with the
   control group (P < 0.05). The use of rescue analgesia was significantly
   lower in the ESPB and mTLIP groups than in the control group (9/30,
   7/30, and 21/30, respectively, P < 0.001). The block procedure time was
   similar between groups (P = 0.198).
   CONCLUSIONS: US-guided ESPB and mTLIP block may provide adequate pain
   control after discectomy surgery. However, there is a nonsuperiority
   between ESPB and the mTLIP groups.}},

Abstract = {{Recently commenced host-parasite interactions provide an excellent
   opportunity to study co-evolutionary processes. Multi-host systems are
   especially informative because variation in virulence between hosts and
   temporal changes provides insight into evolutionary dynamics. However,
   empirical data under natural conditions are scarce. In the present
   study, we investigated the interaction between Darwin's finches and the
   invasive fly Philornis downsi whose larvae feed on the blood of
   nestlings. Recently, however, the fly has changed its behavior and now
   also attacks incubating females. Two sympatric hosts are affected
   differently by the parasite and parasite load has changed over time. Our
   study observed a reversal of trends described two decades ago: while,
   currently, small tree finches (Camarhynchus parvulus) experience
   significantly higher parasite load than warbler finches (Certhidea
   olivacea), this was the opposite two decades ago. Currently, fledging
   success is higher in warbler finches compared to small tree finches. Our
   data indicate that not only intensity but also timing of infestation
   influences hosts' reproductive success and parasite fitness. During
   incubation, prevalence was higher in warbler finches, but once chicks
   had hatched, prevalence was 100\% in both species and parasite load was
   higher in small tree finches. Furthermore, our results suggest faster
   development and higher reproductive success of P. downsi in small tree
   finch nests. A change in host preference driven by larvae competition
   could have led to the reversal in parasite load.}},

Title = {{Housing market shocks in italy: A GVAR approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HOUSING ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{50}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we use a Global Vector Autoregression (GVAR) model to
   assess the spatio-temporal mechanism of house price spillovers, also
   known as ``ripple effect{''}, among 93 Italian provincial housing
   markets, over the period 2004 2016. In order to better capture the local
   housing market dynamics, we use data not only on house prices but also
   on transaction volumes. In particular, we focus on estimating, to what
   extent, exogenous shocks, interpreted as negative housing demand shocks,
   arising from 10 Italian regional capitals, impact on their house prices
   and sales and how these shocks spill over to neighbours housing markets.
   The negative housing market demand shock hitting the GVAR model is
   identified by using theory-driven sign restrictions. The spatio-temporal
   analysis carried through impulse response functions shows that there is
   evidence of a ``ripple effect{''} mainly occurring through transaction
   volumes.}},

Abstract = {{Steganography is a science of hiding data in a medium whereas
   steganalysis is composed of attacks to find the hidden data in a cover
   medium. Since hiding data in a text file would disturb the coherence of
   the text or make it suspicious, systematically changing pixels of a
   visual is a more common method. This process is performed on pixels that
   are spatially (and/or temporally, for video components) distant from
   each other so that a viewer's eye can be deceived. Online media are
   subject to modification such as compression, resolution change, visual
   modifications, and such which makes Scale Invariant Feature Transform
   (SIFT) points appropriate candidates for steganography. The current
   paper has two aims: the first is to propose a method that uses the SIFT
   points of a video for steganography. The second aim is to use
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a steganalysis tool to detect the
   suspicious pixels of a video. The results indicate that the proposed
   steganography method is effective because it yields higher peak
   signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR = 95.41 dB) compared to other techniques
   described in cybersecurity literature, and CNN cannot detect hidden data
   with much success due to its 52\% accuracy rate.}},

Journal = {{NEW IDEAS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{59}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Our understanding of mental disorders has traditionally focused on
   syndromes and symptom clusters rather than on the nature of the symptom
   and signs themselves. Using a core symptom of depression, anhedonia, as
   an extended example, this paper illustrates how the development of
   multiple models of symptoms, at various scales of analysis, may advance
   the explanation and classification of mental disorders. We begin by
   outlining the Phenomena Detection Method (PDM), which links different
   phases of the inquiry process to provide a methodology for
   conceptualizing the symptoms of psychopathology and for constructing
   multi-level models of the pathological processes that comprise them.
   Next, we apply the PDM to anhedonia, building a compositional
   explanation of this core symptom by way of multiple models across four
   scales (levels): molecular, neural, cognitive, and phenomenological.
   Finally, we evaluate our approach in comparison to existing strategies
   for understanding mental disorders.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{251}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) spectroscopy is central to many astrophysical
   disciplines, ranging from helio- to asteroseismology, over solar coronal
   (loop) seismology, to the study of waves and instabilities in jets,
   accretion disks, or solar/stellar atmospheres. MHD spectroscopy
   quantifies all linear (standing or traveling) wave modes, including
   overstable (i.e., growing) or damped modes, for a given configuration
   that achieves force and thermodynamic balance. Here, we present Legolas,
   a novel, open-source numerical code to calculate the full MHD spectrum
   of one-dimensional equilibria with flow, balancing pressure gradients,
   Lorentz forces, centrifugal effects, and gravity, and enriched with
   nonadiabatic aspects like radiative losses, thermal conduction, and
   resistivity. The governing equations use Fourier representations in the
   ignorable coordinates, and the set of linearized equations is
   discretized using finite elements in the important height or radial
   variation, handling Cartesian and cylindrical geometries using the same
   implementation. A weak Galerkin formulation results in a generalized
   (non-Hermitian) matrix eigenvalue problem, and linear algebraic
   algorithms calculate all eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. We
   showcase a plethora of well-established results, ranging from p and g
   modes in magnetized, stratified atmospheres, over modes relevant for
   coronal loop seismology, thermal instabilities, and discrete overstable
   Alfven modes related to solar prominences, to stability studies for
   astrophysical jet flows. We encounter (quasi-)Parker,
   (quasi-)interchange, current-driven, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities,
   as well as nonideal quasi-modes, resistive tearing modes, up to
   magnetothermal instabilities. The use of high resolution sheds new light
   on previously calculated spectra, revealing interesting spectral regions
   that have yet to be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Based on an investigation of the Old Bailey Corpus, this article
   explores the development and usage patterns of maximizers in Late Modern
   English (LModE). The maximizers to be considered for inclusion in the
   study are based on the lists provided in Quirk et al. (1985) and
   Huddleston \& Pullum (2002). The aims of the study were to (i) document
   the frequency development of maximizers, (ii) investigate the
   sociolinguistic embedding of maximizers usage (gender, class) and (iii)
   analyze the sociopragmatics of maximizers based on the speakers' roles,
   such as judge or witness, in the courtroom.
   Of the eleven maximizer types focused on in the investigation, perfectly
   and entirely were found to dominate in frequency. The whole group was
   found to rise over the period 1720 to 1913. In terms of gender, social
   class and speaker roles, there was variation in the use of maximizers
   across the different speaker groups. Prominently, defendants, but also
   judges and lawyers, maximized more than witnesses and victims; further,
   male speakers and higher-ranking speakers used more maximizers. The
   results were interpreted taking into account the courtroom context and
   its dialogue dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Capacity building in public health is an urgent global priority.
   Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on South-South and
   triangular cooperation. We describe our experience with a public health
   training collaboration between Peru and Bolivia, with Peru providing
   capacity building and expertise to Bolivia, while receiving supportive
   funding and training from the United States. This collaboration has led
   to a groundswell of research on clinically significant diseases,
   outreach to more than 800 scientists, several dozen publications, and
   the start of four institutional review boards. South-South and
   South-South-North collaborations should publish their experiences, and
   Northern funding organizations should consider funding such
   collaborations.}},

Title = {{Transversus Abdominis Plane Block With Liposomal Bupivacaine Versus
   Thoracic Epidural for Postoperative Analgesia After Deep Inferior
   Epigastric Artery Perforator Flap-Based Breast Reconstruction}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY}},

Volume = {{85}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Autologous breast reconstruction with abdominally based free
   flaps has traditionally been associated with a longer hospital stay and
   higher initial cost relative to other reconstructive methods. One
   important component of this course is postoperative pain control.
   Thoracic epidural anesthesia is considered among the most effective
   methods for pain control in the immediate postoperative period following
   these procedures. Recently, our institution began using 4 quadrant
   transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks with liposomal bupivacaine.
   Encouraging trends were observed with utilization of TAP blocks;
   however, we sought to quantify this effect compared with that of
   thoracic epidural anesthesia. This study would contribute to a growing
   body of evidence supporting an enhanced recovery pathway for
   microvascular breast reconstruction.
   Method: Thirty patients who underwent deep inferior epigastric artery
   perforator flap-based breast reconstruction from January 2016 to April
   2017 were evaluated. Fifteen patients received thoracic epidural
   anesthesia, and 15 received 4 quadrant TAP blocks with liposomal
   bupivacaine. Opioid consumption was evaluated and compared for the first
   3 days postoperatively. All opioids were converted to oral morphine
   equivalents (OMEs) for standardization. Day of discharge, day of Foley
   removal, and several traditionally opioid-related adverse effects were
   also recorded and compared.
   Result: On postoperative days 0, 1, 2, and 3, opioid consumption among
   those given epidural anesthesia compared with those who received TAP
   blocks with liposomal bupivacaine was 34.9 versus 32.6 OMEs (P = 0.81),
   98.9 versus 92.4 OMEs (P = 0.78), 59.7 versus 56.0 OMEs (P = 0.79), and
   59.6 versus 24.5 OMEs (P = 0.005{*}), respectively. Total opioid
   consumption for the epidural group was 253.1 versus 205.4 OMEs for the
   TAP block group (P = 0.2743). Time until removal of Foley was 2.7 days
   for patients with an epidural and 2.1 days for those receiving TAP
   blocks (P = 0.0056{*}). Length of stay for those receiving epidural was
   4.33 days compared with 3.53 days for those receiving TAP blocks (P =
   0.0002{*}).
   Conclusion: When using TAP blocks with liposomal bupivacaine, a
   statistically significant effect on postoperative day 3 and decreased
   opioid utilization overall were observed. Patients also had their Foley
   removed sooner and were discharged from the hospital earlier.}},

Title = {{Penalizing passenger's transfer time in computing airlines revenue}},
Journal = {{OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{97}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Airline strategic alliances result in a form of cooperation where firms
   can access the resources of others network members in order to create
   added value for their passengers. The shortcoming of this process is
   that each member of the network makes individual revenue management
   decisions to maximize its own income, resulting in a sub-optimal income
   for the network members.
   To deal with this problem, this paper suggests a resource allocation
   based on a transfer pricing mechanism, to cooperatively divide the
   revenue of a passenger between network members. The method penalizes the
   total time that a passenger takes for reaching the final destination.
   The model takes into consideration that the profit is independent of the
   number of available seats (with a maximum determined for each airline).
   The method computes the optimal transfer pricing and, at the same time,
   optimizes the quantity of seats (the booking limits). The solution
   results in a strong Nash equilibrium, which incorporate both the
   transfer prices and booking limits. We describe the transfer pricing
   process using an ergodic, finite and continuous-time Markov game model
   for multiple players. The revenue of each airline in the supply chain
   will depend on the number of flight transfers and the transit time of
   the passenger at the airports: the longer the time to the final
   destination, the lower the price. We compute a collaborative equilibrium
   point, useful for understanding the resulting revenue of each member of
   the network. For solving the game, we employ an iterative method based
   on a proximal approach that involves time penalization. In our final
   contribution, we present results from a numerical example, which
   validates the proposed Markov game model and measures the benefits of
   the transfer pricing resource allocation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Blockchain platforms are coming into use for processing critical
   transactions among participants who have not established mutual trust.
   Many blockchains are programmable, supporting smart contracts, which
   maintain persistent state and support transactions that transform the
   state. Unfortunately, bugs in many smart contracts have been exploited
   by hackers. Obsidian is a novel programming language with a type system
   that enables static detection of bugs that are common in smart contracts
   today. Obsidian is based on a core calculus, Silica, for which we proved
   type soundness. Obsidian uses typestate to detect improper state
   manipulation and uses linear types to detect abuse of assets. We
   integrated a permissions system that encodes a notion of ownership to
   allow for safe, flexible aliasing. We describe two case studies that
   evaluate Obsidian's applicability to the domains of parametric insurance
   and supply chain management, finding that Obsidian's type system
   facilitates reasoning about high-level states and ownership of
   resources. We compared our Obsidian implementation to a Solidity
   implementation, observing that the Solidity implementation requires much
   boilerplate checking and tracking of state, whereas Obsidian does this
   work statically.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of Review Digital phenotyping involves the quantification of in
   situ phenotypes using personal digital devices and holds the potential
   to dramatically reshape how serious mental illnesses (SMI) assessment is
   conducted. Despite promise, few, if any, digital phenotyping efforts for
   SMI have garnered the support necessary for clinical implementation.
   Recent Findings In this paper, we highlight how digital phenotyping
   efforts can be improved by integrating data from multiple channels
   (i.e., ``multimodal{''} data integration). We begin by arguing that
   ``multimodal{''} integration is critical for digital phenotyping of
   many, possibly most, SMI symptoms. Next, we consider computational
   approaches that can accommodate multimodal data.
   Summary We conclude by considering next steps for multimodal data for
   research and clinical applications. We punctuate this paper with
   examples of multimodal digital phenotyping using natural language
   processing (NLP) to measure speech disorganization in psychosis.}},

   particulate bone graft was examined in vitro. Cells were cultured on rat
   bone particles +/- mesh; proliferation and osteoblast differentiation
   were assessed. The interface between the vertebral endplate, PET mesh,
   and newly formed bone within consolidated allograft contained by mesh
   was examined in a sheep model via microradiographs, histology, and
   mechanical testing.
   Results: Growth on bone particles stimulated proliferation and early
   differentiation of NHOst cells and MSCs, but delayed terminal
   differentiation. This was not negatively impacted by mesh. New bone
   formation in vivo was not prevented by use of a PET mesh graft
   containment device. Fusion was improved in sites containing
   allograft/demineralized bone matrix (DBM) versus autograft and was
   further enhanced when stabilized using pedicle screws. Only sites
   treated with allograft/DBM+screws exhibited greater percent bone
   ingrowth versus discectomy or autograft. These results were mirrored
   biomechanically.
   Conclusions: PET mesh does not negatively impact cell attachment to
   particulate bone graft, proliferation, or initial osteoblast
   differentiation. The results demonstrated that bone growth occurs from
   vertebral endplates into graft material within the PET mesh. This was
   enhanced by stabilization with pedicle screws leading to greater bone
   ingrowth and biomechanical stability across the fusion site.
   Clinical Relevance: The use of extended PET mesh allows containment of
   bone graft material during vertebral interbody fusion without inhibiting
   migration of osteoprogenitor cells from vertebral end plates in order to
   achieve fusion.

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aimed to describe by mathematical modeling an
   accurate course of core body temperature (CBT) in severe trauma patients
   and its relation to sepsis.
   Methods: In a cohort of severe trauma, the CBT measurements were
   collected for 24 h on day 2 after admission and rhythmicity assessed by
   Fourier transform and Cosinor analysis to describe circadian features
   (frequency and amplitude). CBT was compared between patients who
   developed sepsis or not during the early ICU stay.
   Results: 33 patients were included in this analysis. 24 patients (73\%)
   had a predominant rhythm of 24 h (period). The main period was lower in
   the 9 remaining patients (6 of 12 h, 1 of 8 h, and 2 of 6 h). Other
   significant frequencies of oscillation (second and third frequencies)
   were found, which showed an association of several well marked rhythms.
   Patients with sepsis (n = 12) had a significantly higher level of CBT,
   but also more intense rhythms and higher amplitudes of CBT.
   Conclusion: Trauma patients exhibit complex temperature circadian
   rhythms. Early exacerbation of the temperature rhythmicity (in frequency
   and amplitude) is associated with the development of sepsis. This
   observation accentuates the concept of circadian disruption and sepsis
   in ICU patients. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Crowdfunding is gaining popularity as a way of financing social
   sustainable initiatives. We performed a controlled economic experiment
   in MTurk by simulating a crowdfunding platform and developed a
   theoretical model that rationalizes herding behavior. The experiment was
   designed to test and quantify the causal effects of revealing specific
   information to prospective backers: (i) the number of early contributors
   already financing the project and (ii) positive opinions of other
   backers versus those of experts. The results show that early
   contributions to the campaign and positive opinions of peers act as a
   reinforcing signal to potential backers and affect backers' beliefs
   about the probability of success, increasing contributions to the
   campaign. Furthermore, we show that herding is rational and set
   expectations on when we should observe rational herding and when not.
   The theoretical model captures the rational herding, which may be the
   main information aggregation path in reward-based crowdfunding
   platforms, and can help managers increase the likelihood of success in
   crowdfunding campaigns.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: This study assessed the changes in color and translucency of dentin
   and enamel after staining and bleaching procedures as well as the
   contribution of the tissues to color change (CTCC).
   Materials and methods: Fifty enamel-dentin specimens were obtained from
   bovine incisors and grouped into 10 blocks based on the similarity of
   the baseline color. One specimen in each block was used as the control,
   and the others were intrinsically (blood) or extrinsically (coffee)
   stained. One stained specimen for each pigment was bleached with 35\%
   hydrogen peroxide. The enamel was separated from the dentin, and the
   tooth color and translucency parameter (TP) were measured individually
   and after recombining these substrates. Changes in color (Delta E00),
   whitening index (WI), and TP caused by the staining and bleaching
   procedures were estimated through assessing the color differences
   compared with the controls.CTCC was also calculated by recombining the
   enamel and dentin tissues from different treatments. The data were
   analyzed using the paired t test or the two-way repeated measures ANOVA
   (a = 0.05).
   Results: Extrinsic staining procedures produced higher color changes
   than intrinsic ones, except in dentin. The highest bleaching effect was
   observed in the dentin of specimens that were extrinsically stained.
   Similar CTCC values were observed for the dentin and enamel for both the
   staining and bleaching procedures. Except for the specimens that were
   treated with intrinsic staining and became more translucent after the
   bleaching procedure, the other treatments resulted in non-significant TP
   changes.
   Conclusions: Staining the specimens extrinsically resulted in higher
   color change than staining them intrinsically, and these specimens were
   more affected by the bleaching procedure. Enamel and dentin demonstrated
   similar CTCC values.

Abstract = {{The direct impacts of storms on beaches have been well studied; less
   well understood are the controls of storms on their seasonal-interannual
   evolution. We apply a novel empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis
   to a 5-year data set of monthly subaerial beach topography at Kennedy
   Space Center, Florida, to extract dominant spatiotemporal topographic
   patterns. Our hybrid surface EOF (SEOF) approach applies 1-D EOF
   techniques to a data set varying in two dimensions, thereby extracting
   topographic patterns in the longshore and cross-shore simultaneously
   while preserving the analytical simplicity of 1-D approaches. These
   topographic patterns are then linked to observations of storm impacts.
   Our approach comprehensively illustrates that storms influenced local
   topographic evolution over event-to-interannual-timescales. The first
   mode of topographic variability captures an interannual-scale change in
   behavior triggered by the impact of Hurricane Sandy (2012), whereby a
   cape feature began and sustained rapid aggradation following the event.
   This pattern is likely linked to storm-response processes and
   pre-existing morphodynamic feedbacks, illustrating that storm response
   can dictate poststorm recovery processes. This pattern overwhelmed a
   spatially uniform, seasonal topographic signal, which we attribute to
   seasonal variability in water level and storminess forcings. The third

Abstract = {{The recent sports grants scandal has again highlighted the enduring
   nature of pork barrelling allegations in Australian politics. Although
   excessive and blatant pork barrelling is widely condemned, there has
   been limited consideration of how pork barrelling is regulated in
   Australia and the effectiveness of this regime. This paper explores the
   interacting accountability mechanisms that regulate pork barrelling in
   Australia at the federal level including the offence of electoral
   bribery, financial legislation and regulations, administrative law,
   ministerial standards, caretaker conventions, the Auditor-General and
   the media. This regulatory regime provides oversight, contributes to
   systemically improving the administration of grants programs and
   provides a framework of standards to evaluate whether alleged pork
   barrelling conduct is either ordinary political conduct or the improper
   use of public resources for partisan purposes. However, the
   effectiveness of the current regime in deterring excessive pork
   barrelling is limited by the absence of mechanisms to enforce these
   standards.}},

Abstract = {{The dual-purpose model of keeping sheep in vineyards is currently
   receiving relatively high attention. Sheep are able to take over
   obligatory viticultural work steps and are an interesting option for
   wine marketing. However, using sheep in vineyards also entails risks and
   disadvantages, such as the effort and expense involved in keeping the
   animals and the lack of information. In German viticulture, a large part
   of the vines are espaliered with flat arches. How long the use of sheep
   in the flat-arch system is possible during the growing season is not
   least a question of the choice of sheep breed. In the present study,
   breeds were evaluated with regard to their suitability for the
   dual-purpose model. To this end, the breed characteristics required for
   viticulture were identified. These are partially not addressed by the
   existing breeding guidelines. In the study, 94 pedigree breeders were
   therefore asked about specific breed characteristics such as cooperation
   or the ability to stand on two legs. The height of the mouth is
   particularly important for assessing the suitability of a breed of
   sheep, as it defines the potential impact on the leaf wall. To determine
   the height of the mouth, 179 animals were measured by pedigree breeders.
   Shropshire of the Danish breeding line, Southdown (not to be confused
   with ``Babydoll{''}) and, with some limitations, Ouessant were
   identified as particularly suitable breeds for use in the flat-arch
   system. These are 3 of 27 breeds covered here. Finally, possible
   breeding options for a new ``vineyard sheep breed{''} are mentioned.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly complex knowledge, new technologies, global-scale know-how
   needs to be translated on the local scale, to be truly effective. In
   this scenario, the role of the university is to codify this path into
   cognitive and practical terms, combining educational and training
   objectives with the knowledge transfer at the local level, as part of
   the third mission, by offering field-based learning.
   This approach has been adopted in recent years in the Urban Planning
   Techniques courses held within the Unique Cycle Master degree in
   Building Engineering and Architecture at the University of Bologna
   where, in the a.y. 2019/2020, it was proposed to students to measure
   themselves on a real case study such as the drafting process of the new
   General Urban Plan of the Municipality of Castelfranco Emilia (MO).
   However, the ongoing unexpected Covid-19 pandemic has challenged the
   teaching and planning process. It has imposed limitations and outlined
   new challenges, but at the same time it has allowed - both students and
   civil servants - to explore the opportunities offered by the digital
   resources available and by the panoramic navigation tools within the
   built environment, which have revealed some key potentials that so far
   have been only partially explored. Therefore, this paper intends to
   show, through a real case application, how the digitization of
   information and the new methodologies for teaching urban planning
   techniques can contribute to improve the accuracy of the knowledge
   available at the micro/ building scale, which is at the basis of the
   definition of tailored regeneration practices.}},

Journal = {{MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{159}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we have both synthesized and studied
   4-phenylbutyl-3,5-dinitrobenzoate (3,5-DNBPh) as a potential precursor
   of an electrocatalytic mediator for the oxidation of NADH, with the
   di-nitro compound immobilized in a three-dimensional network of glassy
   carbon electrodes modified with MWCNTs. This di-nitro compound is
   activated electrochemically to selectively generate one
   nitroso-hydroxylamine redox pair, which ultimately acts as a redox
   mediator of NADH oxidation. Thus, NADH electrocatalysis displaces the
   oxidation potential of NADH with the formation of a single voltammetric
   peak, the displacement occurs from Ep = +0.374 V in GCE/MWCNT to +0.001
   V in GCE/MWCNT/3,5-DNBPh (very close to 0 V, Delta Ep = 0.373 V). The
   4-phenylbutyl-3,5-dinitrobenzoate mediator is sensitive to NADH
   concentration, and a linear regression between 0.1 and 0.6 mM NADH (r(2)
   = 0.99) was obtained, with a detection limit of 22.3 mu M (S/N = 3) and
   a quantification limit of 74.2 mu M (S/N = 10). The developed modified
   electrode presents low NADH electrocatalytic oxidation potentials, and
   an interesting and novel advantage is that the preparation of the
   electrodes is fast, clean and effective, allowing biosensors to be
   obtained in a few steps.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) to standard
   graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis following haploidentical
   blood stem transplants has resulted in relatively low rates of GVHD. As
   GVHD remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients
   receiving transplants from matched donors, we began to use PTCy in all
   blood stem cell transplants in 2016 and compared our recent experience
   with PTCy after matched sibling and unrelated donor transplants (N = 49)
   to the earlier 2-year period (N = 41) when PTCy was not used. Endpoints
   included graft-versus-host, relapse-free-survival (GRFS), overall
   survival, non-relapse mortality, and percentage of patients disease-free
   and off immunosuppression (DFOI) at 1 year and at the last follow-up.
   The difference in GRFS between the standard and the PTCy cohort was not
   statistically significant. There was a statistically improved
   relapse-free and overall survival in the PTCY cohort that was due to a
   significant decrease in non-relapse mortality secondary to GVHD. There
   was also a borderline statistically improved DFOI at 1 year and at last
   follow-up in the PTCY group. These results suggest that PTCy after
   HLA-matched transplants provides at least comparable efficacy to other
   GVHD strategies and may allow more frequent discontinuation of
   immunosuppression.}},

Title = {{The Energy, Momentum, and Peak Power Radiated by Negative Lightning
   Return Strokes}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Electromagnetic radiation fields generated by return strokes transport
   both energy and momentum from the return stroke to outer space. The
   momentum transported by the radiation field has only a vertical or z
   component due to azimuthal symmetry (cylindrical symmetry) associated
   with a vertical return stroke. In this paper, the energy, momentum, and
   peak power radiated by return strokes as a function of the return stroke
   current, return stroke speed, and the zero-crossing time of the
   radiation fields are studied. The results obtained by numerical
   simulations for the energy, vertical momentum, and the peak power
   radiated by lightning return strokes (all parameters normalized by
   dividing them by the square of the radiation field peak at 100 km) are
   the following: A typical first return stroke generating a radiation
   field having a 50 mu s zero-crossing time will dissipate field
   normalized energy of about (1.7-2.5) x 10(3) J/(V/m)(2) and
   field-normalized vertical momentum of approximately (2.3-3.1) x 10(-6)
   Kg m/s/(V/m)(2). A radiation field with a zero-crossing time of 70 mu s
   will dissipate about (2.6-3.4) x 10(3) J/(V/m)(2) in field-normalized
   energy and (3.2-4.3) x 10(-6) Kg m/s/(V/m)(2) in field-normalized
   vertical momentum. The results show that, for a given peak radiation
   field, the radiated energy and momentum increase with increasing
   zero-crossing time of the radiation field. The normalized peak power
   generated by a first return stroke radiation field is about 1.2 x 10(8)
   W/(V/m)(2) and the peak power is generated within about 5-6 mu s from
   the beginning of the return stroke. Conversely, a typical subsequent
   return stroke generating a radiation field having a 40 mu s
   zero-crossing time will dissipate field-normalized energy of about (6-9)
   x 10(2) J/(V/m)(2) and field-normalized vertical momentum of
   approximately (7.5-11) x 10(-7) Kg m/s/(V/m)(2). The field-normalized
   peak power generated by a subsequent return stroke radiation field is
   about 1.26 x 10(8) W/(V/m)(2) and the peak power is generated within
   about 0.7-0.8 mu s from the beginning of the return stroke. In addition
   to these parameters, the possible upper bounds for the energy and
   momentum radiated by return strokes are also presented.}},

Title = {{Green vs brown food web: Effects of habitat type on multidimensional
   stability proxies for a highly-resolved Antarctic food web}},
Journal = {{FOOD WEBS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Food web analyses are powerful tools to understand the structure,
   dynamics and stability of communities. Potter Cove (25 de Mayo/King
   George Island) is one of the most biodiverse and studied fjords on the
   West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), where climate change is affecting
   benthic and pelagic communities. This fiord ecosystem presents a
   considerable degree of environmental and species distribution
   heterogeneity across space: the outer portion of the cove is dominated
   by hard bottoms meanwhile the inner portion is dominated by soft
   bottoms. In this work, we have incorporated habitat type to a
   highly-resolved Antarctic food web, and evaluated its effects on
   different network metrics and proxies for various dimensions of
   stability. We considered a multidimensional perspective and employed
   simulation techniques to encompass variability. Our results showed that
   the incorporation of habitat type to Potter Cove food web analysis led
   to two different functional types of networks segregated on space: a
   green food web (in the outer cove) and a brown food web (in the inner
   cove). The green and the brown food webs showed significant differences
   in network structure and in some proxies for multidimensional stability
   (i.e. quasi sign-stability and omnivory), suggesting that these two food
   webs have different resilience to perturbations. However, there were no
   changes in network robustness when in silico experiments were performed.
   We conclude that habitat type plays a significant role in the structure
   and stability of Antarctic food webs, and should be taken into account
   to design effective conservation strategies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Stem water potential-based regulated deficit irrigation scheduling for
   olive table trees}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{242}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) involves water stress management in
   different phenological periods throughout the season. Research in olive
   trees (oil production) suggested RDI during pit hardening based in
   predawn and midday stem water potential (SWP) thresholds. However, the
   previous thresholds may not be extrapolated to table olive because fruit
   size, a very important feature in the table olive yield quality, is very
   sensitive to water stress. RDI in table olive deserve further research
   to determine the optimal water potential thresholds and the duration of
   the RDI periods for the specificity of the crop (low crop load to
   promote high fruit size). The aim of this work was to study different
   RDI schedules during pit hardening, considering different levels and
   durations of water stress. The experiment was performed in the 2015,
   2016 and 2017 seasons, in a commercial mature table olive orchard (cv.
   Manzanilla) in Dos Hermanas (Seville, Spain). Control treatments were
   based on midday SWP measurement in order to optimize the water status
   with values around - 1.4 MPa. Two RDI treatments were applied during pit
   hardening, dated (according to the changes in longitudinal fruit growth)
   from mid-June to the last week of August) to maintain water potential
   values around -2 MPa (RDI-1) and -3.5 MPa (RDI-3). Another RDI treatment
   (RDI-2) received irrigation to maintain values around -3.5 MPa but the
   recovery was performed at early July in order to obtain different
   durations of water stress. Irrigation strategies were evaluated with
   water relations measurements (soil moisture, gas exchange), fruit and
   shoot growth and quality and quantity yield indicators. Yield was not
   significantly affected in any of the RDI treatments with an ANOVA
   analysis. However, fruit drop estimated as the percentage of fruit lost
   only in the period of water deficit was related with water stress
   parameters (SWP and stress integral, IS). In addition, the relationship
   between fruits size and these latter parameters were significant and
   change according to yield level. Irrigation treatments did not affect
   next season yield because shoot growth and number of inflorescence at
   the beginning of each season were not different. RDI effect changed
   according to yield level, mainly in relation with fruit size. Data
   suggest that yield levels up to 12 t ha(-1) were possible to manage RDI
   without affecting fruit size or reducing commercial quality.}},

   With the help of the 1910 federal census data accessible through the
   Digital Harrisburg website, students engaged this little-known history
   of their hometown through field trips followed by poetry workshops. As
   students imagined the world through the lens of a person in the Old
   Eighth Ward, they drew on their own experiences and imagination.
   Published and performed for diverse audiences in different venues, these
   poems invite a wider public to rethink the City Beautiful movement as
   they reimagine the once vibrant community.}},

Abstract = {{After retiring from The Suze Orman Show, Suze Orman remained highly
   visible across media. Recently, she returned with her revised bestseller
   Women and Money (2018a) and a weekly podcast timed to coincide with
   \#metoo. Across media, Orman has utilized the affect associated with
   feminine media genres, including self-help and makeover shows, to
   promote a lifestyle based on proper financial self-management. Her
   advice to women about marriage, motherhood, and filial duty makes it
   clear that such discipline is particularly gendered. Orman both uses and
   chafes against feminist discourses to frame finance as another problem
   to be managed for women. I understand Orman's advice as affective
   through her use of fear, shame, and pride to promote individualized
   financialization at the expense of interpersonal relationships. My
   unique approach brings affect theory to financial media through analysis
   of Orman's media texts.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental, economic and social challenges re-launched in the
   European Union Agendas (e.g., Horizon 2020 and Europe 2020-2030) have
   recently returned to being highly debated. In particular, policies and
   interventions in the field of social housing (SH) are still remaining
   crucial issues for urban regeneration. These interventions are aimed to
   combine sustainability criteria with architectural, urban and
   environmental quality. In this context, our goal in this article is to
   provide an innovative perspective on the topic highlighting the positive
   returns enabled by the logic of the social impact approach (SIA). A
   pilot project is proposed to be performed in the VI arrondissement of
   Paris. Starting from the French regulatory context and the requirements
   set by the ``Paris Affordable Housing Challenge{''} competition, the
   levers of social finance for new social demands and the levers of
   incentives are applied to a real case. The research results show that
   the application of the emerging principles of social impact investing
   (SII) in areas difficult to access in the private market had positive
   returns. The final aim of the article is to outline guidelines that
   consider the quality, management and generation of the social impact
   requirements highlighted in the proposal to facilitate the application

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Microbial metabolomics is a challenge strategy that allows a
   comprehensive analysis of metabolites within a microorganism and may
   support a new approach in microbial research, including the microbial
   diagnosis. Thus, the aim of this research was to in-depth explore a
   metabolomics strategy based on the use of an advanced multidimensional
   gas chromatography for the comprehensive mapping of cellular metabolites
   of C. albicans and non-C. albicans (C. glabrata and C. tropicalis) and
   therefore contributing for the development of a comprehensive platform
   for fungal detection management and for species distinction in early
   growth times (6 h). The volatile fraction comprises 126 putatively
   identified metabolites distributed over several chemical families:
   acids, alcohols, aldehydes, hydrocarbons, esters, ketones, monoterpenic
   and sesquiterpenic compounds, norisoprenoids, phenols and sulphur
   compounds. These metabolites may be related with different metabolic
   pathways, such as amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis, fatty acids
   metabolism, aromatic compounds degradation, mono and sesquiterpenoid
   synthesis and carotenoid cleavage. These results represent an
   enlargement of ca. 70\% of metabolites not previously reported for C.
   albicans, 91\% for C. glabrata and 90\% for C. tropicalis. This study
   represents the most detailed study about Candida species exometabolome,
   allowing a metabolomic signature of each species, which signifies an
   improvement towards the construction of a Candida metabolomics platform
   whose application in clinical diagnostics can be crucial to guide

Abstract = {{Objectives
   The aims of the study were (1) to analyze the etiology and clinical
   management of headaches in children in the emergency department and (2)
   to analyze the treatment used in children diagnosed with headaches and
   with migraines. Methods
   Retrospective study of all the patients who were admitted to the
   pediatric emergency department of Hospital Professor Doutor Fernando
   Fonseca, Lisbon, in 2014, with a chief complaint of headaches or the
   primary discharge diagnosis was headache/migraine. Results
   Headache related cases represented 3.8\% of all the visits, a total of
   2354 subjects. The median age was 10 years and 52.6\% were female. The
   most frequent diagnoses were as follow: headaches (21.3\%), upper
   respiratory infections (18.4\%), and migraines (6.1\%). There were 4
   cases of meningitis, 6,5\% of all patients underwent computed tomography
   which was mostly requested in school-age children and adolescents. The
   average time from the first medical observation until discharge was 85
   minutes. Fifty-five percent did not take any pain relief medication,
   17.2\% took acetaminophen, and 11.1\% took ibuprofen. Patients who
   received ondansetron had less revisits (P = 0.000). Subjects with
   mild-moderate pain treated with acetaminophen or no medication had more
   revisits (P = 0.000). Conclusions
   Secondary benign headaches were the most common and very rarely headache
   as a symptom was associated with life-threatening situations.
   Antiemetics seem to be efficient ally in the treatment of primary
   headaches, but it is important to consider alternative pharmacological
   regimes in patients who present with higher pain scores.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The aim of the present study was to evaluate in an adult population
   the correlation between different methods for the evaluation of
   halitosis and investigate the influence of prosthetic rehabilitation on
   halitosis level.
   Materials and methods A sample of 50 adult patients was selected at the
   Dentistry Unit of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy, who were
   divided in Group 1 (absence of prosthesis), Group 2 (fixed prosthesis),
   and Group 3 (removable prosthesis). The assessment of oral malodor was
   carried out by organoleptic evaluation, measuring the concentration of
   H2S, CH3SH, and (CH3)2S with Oral Chroma (TM) and quantification of
   salivary beta-galactosidases (S beta-g) activity through the
   spectrophotometric method. Statistics: Anova, Postdoc LSD test,
   Pearson's correlation coefficient (P) and Spearman's correlation
   coefficient (Rho) were used; p values less than 0.05 were considered
   significant.
   Results A positive and significant correlation between organoleptic
   evaluation, S beta-g, levels of volatile sulfur compounds Oral Chroma
   (TM) measurements was found (p<0.05). By stratifying patients with and
   without a dental prosthesis, it was possible to show a significant
   increase of organoleptic scores (p<0.05), beta-galactosidase (p<0.05),
   food stagnation (p<0.01) and a higher scores of H2S (p<0.05) and CH3SH
   (p<0.05) in patients wearing a prosthesis. Stratifying results between
   Groups 1-2-3, it was possible to see that some parameters were higher in
   Group 3, followed by Group 2.
   Conclusion The presence of prosthetic rehabilitation negatively affected
   halitosis in the patients according to both clinical and self-reported
   evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of various amaranth flour (AF) particle sizes influence added
   in different amounts in refined wheat flour (WF) seems necessary to
   properly design systems with expected rheological properties. The study
   aimed to assess the effects of factors, particle size and level of AF
   added in WF on Falling number index (FN) and dough rheological
   properties described by Mixolab in a systematic investigation based on
   design of experiment. The level of AF added in WF significantly
   influenced the FN values in the linear and quadratic terms (p < 0.05),
   revealing a decrease with the level increase. Particle size played a
   significant role in increasing water absorption in linear and quadratic
   terms (p < 0.05), whereas only the linear term has a significant effect
   (p < 0.005) on dough development time and stability. Particle size
   increase and the interaction between particle size and AF significantly
   increased torques C2 and C3. AF level increase in WF significantly
   decreased the torques C4 and C5. The optimization results highlighted
   that the most suitable combination would be the composite flour with
   9.74\% AF of 280 mu m particle size incorporated in WF. The proposed
   approach and the information resulted can be relevant for industrial

Abstract = {{We compared regional retention of 18F-flortaucipir between 20 patients
   with Lewy body disorders (LBD), 12 Alzheimer's disease patients with
   positive amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans (AD+AB) and 15
   healthy controls with negative amyloid PET scans (HC-AB). In LBD
   subjects, we compared the relationship between F-18-flortaucipir
   retention and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau, cognitive performance, and
   neuropathological tau at autopsy. The LBD cohort was stratified using an
   AB42 cut-off of 192 pg/mL to enrich for groups likely harboring tau
   pathology (LBD+AB = 11, LBD-AB = 9). 18Fflortaucipir retention was
   higher in LBD+AB than HC-AB in five, largely temporal-parietal regions
   with sparing of medial temporal regions. Higher retention was associated
   with higher CSF total-tau levels (p = 0.04), poorer domain-specific
   cognitive performance (p = 0.02-0.04), and greater severity of
   neuropathological tau in corresponding regions. While F-18-flortaucipir
   retention in LBD is intermediate between healthy controls and AD,
   retention relates to cognitive impairment, CSF total-tau, and
   neuropathological tau. Future work in larger autopsy-validated cohorts
   is needed to define LBD-specific tau biomarker profiles. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus
   which causes COVID-19, is highly contagious. Dentistry is a high-risk
   profession for occupational virus transmission because of the close
   proximity of the operator to the patient during treatment and the
   procedural generation of aerosols.
   The impact on the provision of dental care has been profound, with
   routine care restricted or paused for a period around the world. There
   have been adverse consequences for dental education and clinical
   research. Emergency and urgent care provisions have generally proceeded.
   However, even when a patient's condition is deemed urgent, access to the
   appropriate care may not have been possible due to lack of the
   recommended personal protective equipment. The common dental diseases of
   caries and periodontitis usually present with signs and symptoms after
   some advancement, hence the recommended regular dental examination so
   that these may be diagnosed early by a professional with suitable
   lighting, instruments and radiography. Conditions such as oral cancer
   similarly present in their early stages without symptoms. Many countries
   introduced telephone and video consultations for patients with symptoms
   but much disease has gone undiagnosed and without management.
   It is difficult to ascertain the full effect of the disruption to dental
   services, education and research but it is likely to be substantial. The
   immediate future will focus on return to routine care provision with
   likely longer-term permanent changes.}},

   Learning Algorithms}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Featured Application
   Geometric Morphometrics are a powerful multivariate statistical toolset
   for the analysis of morphology. While typically used in the study of
   biological and anatomical variance, modern applications now incorporate
   these tools into a number of different fields of non-biological origin.
   Nevertheless, as with many fields of data science, Geometric
   Morphometric techniques are often impeded by issues concerning sample
   size. The present study thus evaluates a number of different
   computational learning algorithms for the augmentation of different
   datasets. Here we show how generative algorithms from Artificial
   Intelligence are able to produce highly realistic synthetic data;
   helping improve the quality of any statistical or predictive modelling
   applications that may follow.
   The fossil record is notorious for being incomplete and distorted,
   frequently conditioning the type of knowledge that can be extracted from
   it. In many cases, this often leads to issues when performing complex
   statistical analyses, such as classification tasks, predictive
   modelling, and variance analyses, such as those used in Geometric
   Morphometrics. Here different Generative Adversarial Network
   architectures are experimented with, testing the effects of sample size
   and domain dimensionality on model performance. For model evaluation,
   robust statistical methods were used. Each of the algorithms were
   observed to produce realistic data. Generative Adversarial Networks
   using different loss functions produced multidimensional synthetic data
   significantly equivalent to the original training data. Conditional
   Generative Adversarial Networks were not as successful. The methods
   proposed are likely to reduce the impact of sample size and bias on a
   number of statistical learning applications. While Generative
   Adversarial Networks are not the solution to all sample-size related
   issues, combined with other pre-processing steps these limitations may
   be overcome. This presents a valuable means of augmenting geometric
   morphometric datasets for greater predictive visualization.}},

Abstract = {{Butterflies display incredible ecological and behavioural diversity. As
   such, they have been subject to intense study since the birth of
   evolutionary biology. However, with some possible exceptions, they are
   underused models in comparative and functional neurobiology. We
   highlight a series of areas, spanning sensory ecology to cognition, in
   which butterflies are particularly promising systems for investigating
   the neurobiological basis for behavioural or ecological variation. These
   fields benefit from a history of molecular and quantitative genetics,
   and basic comparative neuroanatomy, but these strands of research are
   yet to be widely integrated. We discuss areasfor potential growth and
   argue that new experimental techniques, growing genomic resources, and
   tools for functional genetics will accelerate the use of butterflies in
   neurobiology.}},

Abstract = {{A generic and straightforward numerical strategy for the determination
   of the size of Representative Contact Elements (RCEs), which are
   employed in finite element contact homogenization procedures, is
   proposed in this contribution. The approach enables the determination of
   the length, height and mesh discretisation of RCEs that provide a good
   statistical representation of the contact interface, described by a
   given set of topography properties. The case of Gaussian self-affine and
   elastic rough profiles under normal, frictionless and non-adhesive
   contact is analysed in detail. A collection of conditions has been
   derived for two-dimensional problems, based on a trade-off between the
   convergence of the real contact area and the computational cost. With
   the increasing width of the roughness power spectrum, the restrictions
   imposed on the length and mesh size can be relaxed, allowing to reduce
   the size of numerical models. The corresponding class of problems in
   three-dimensions has also been studied. In this case, the influence of
   the numerical scheme adopted for the evaluation of the contact area has
   been analysed leading to the identification of two bounds, which
   converge for the same value with progressively finer meshes.
   State-of-the-art numerical results fall within the bounded region, and
   the application of the area correction technique proposed by Yastrebov
   et al. to the upper node-based bound, accelerates the convergence of the
   mesh and renders a good agreement with reference data. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The ubiquity and commoditisation of wearable biosensors (fitness bands)
   has led to a deluge of personal healthcare data, but with limited
   analytics typically fed back to the user. The feasibility of feeding
   back more complex, seemingly unrelated measures to users was
   investigated, by assessing whether increased levels of stress, anxiety
   and depression (factors known to affect cardiac function) and general
   health measures could be accurately predicted using heart rate
   variability (HRV) data from wrist wearables alone. Levels of stress,
   anxiety, depression and general health were evaluated from subjective
   questionnaires completed on a weekly or twice-weekly basis by 652
   participants. These scores were then converted into binary levels
   (either above or below a set threshold) for each health measure and used
   as tags to train Deep Neural Networks (LSTMs) to classify each health
   measure using HRV data alone. Three data input types were investigated:
   time domain, frequency domain and typical HRV measures. For mental
   health measures, classification accuracies of up to 83\% and 73\% were
   achieved, with five and two minute HRV data streams respectively,
   showing improved predictive capability and potential future wearable use
   for tracking stress and well-being.}},

Title = {{Investigation of fibrillin microfibrils in the canine cruciate ligament
   in dogs with different predispositions to ligament rupture}},
Journal = {{RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{53-58}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cranial cruciate ligament disease (CCLD) is the most common cause of
   pelvic limb lameness in dogs but its precise aetiopathogenesis is
   uncertain. Fibrillin microfibrils (FM) are complex macro-molecular
   assemblies found in many tissues including ligaments, where they are
   thought to play an important mechanical role. We hypothesised that FM
   ultrastructural variation correlates with the differing predisposition
   of canine breeds to CCLD.
   Non-diseased cranial and caudal cruciate ligaments (CCLs and CaCLs) were
   obtained from Greyhound (GH) and Staffordshire Bull Terrier (SBT)
   cadavers. Fibrillin microfibrils were extracted from the ligaments by
   bacterial collagenase digestion, purified by size-exclusion
   chromatography and subsequently visualized by atomic force microscopy
   (AFM). With AFM, FMs have a characteristic beads-on-a-string appearance.
   For each FM, periodicity (bead-bead distance) and length (number of
   beads/FM) was measured.
   Fibrillin microfibril length was found to be similar for GH and SBT,
   with non-significant inter-breed and interligament differences.
   Fibrillin microfibril periodicity varied when comparing GH and SBT for
   CCL (GH 60.2 +/- 1.4 nm; SBT 56.2 +/- 0.8 nm) and CaCL (GH 55.5 +/- 1.6
   nm; SBT 61.2 +/- 1.2 nm). A significant difference was found in the
   periodicity distribution when comparing CCL for both breeds (P <
   0.00001), further, intra-breed differences in CCL vs CaCL were
   statistically significant within both breeds (P < 0.00001). The breed at
   low risk of CCLD exhibited a periodicity profile which may be suggestive
   of a repair and remodelling within the CCL.}},

Abstract = {{For the better part of the past decade, global social movements have
   drawn popular attention to the power of image production and acts of

   interrogating a broader ``politics of visibility{''} at work in the
   early twenty-first century, most readily apparent through the activities
   of smartphone-enabled and visually-savvy activists. As new media
   technologies have opened up new strategies of representation, these
   modes of representation have been incorporated into existing media
   practices that delimit the ways in which the consequentiality of various
   movements and political projects can be understood. Theoretically
   revisiting the concept of visibility, this essay critiques the
   relationship between technology and the production of knowledge in media
   studies before arguing that the visibility of an event presages a
   consequentiality partially determined by the ways in which it is

Abstract = {{We present the bat assemblage from the early Miocene (MN4, 16.9-15.95
   MY) basin of Ribesalbes-Alcora, which has yielded the remains of ten
   chiropteran taxa. Bat assemblages are rarely recovered in the
   fluvio-lacustrine fossil record. A bat species described in this work,
   Cuvierimops penalveri sp. nov., is a new form of a typically Oligocene
   free-tailed bat. In addition, the other molossids Hydromops helveticus,
   Rhizomops cf. brasiliensis, Chaerephon sp., Tadarida sp., and the
   vespertilionids Myotis cf. intermedius and Miostrellus aff.
   petersbuchensis, as well as undetermined fossils ascribed to the genera
   Submyotodon, Plecotus, and Rhinolophus are described. This is the first
   record of the genus Rhizomops in the early Miocene; the genus
   Cuvierimops is the first recording from the Neogene, while the `Lazarus
   taxon' Chaerephon is the first fossil record of this genus, registered
   previously only in Holocene deposits. This bat assemblage with a high
   abundance of molossids is typical from the early Oligocene of western
   Europe, while in the early Miocene from Europe the molossids are scarce.
   The abundance of these bats is consistent with the presence of a
   tropical forest surrounding a paleolake. The fossils from the
   Ribesalbes-Alcora Basin represent the most complete bat assemblage of
   the Iberian Peninsula during this age, and significantly increase our
   knowledge about the early Miocene bats of Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   The aim of this research is to analyze the clinical utility of the
   ``Theory of Mind{''} (TM) subtest of NEPSY-II (Korkman et al., 2014).
   Methodology
   TM was applied to 244 school aged children with normal intelligence: a
   control group (n=194) and clinical groups (n=50): ASD-grade 1 (n= 10);
   procedural learning disorder ( PLD, n=24); and ADHD (n=16).
   Results and Discussion
   We do a examination of the factorial structure through a exploratory
   (KMO=0.62 and MSA=0,54-0,75) and confirmatory (chi =22,75 p=0,504;
   TLI=1,04; CFI=1; RMSEA=0) analyses. The 21 items of the TM. 3 factors
   are obtained that explain 62\% of the total variance: Theory of mind
   (items 1/2/7); Social stories comprehension (items 5/8/10/14) and
   Contextual coherence (items 9/12 / 16-21). The descriptive statistics
   are provided from the calculation of validity and reliability. None of
   the groups differ in the first two factors (U-mann-Whitney). In
   Contextual coherence, the PLD group and the control groups (p=,001)
   differed significantly of the ASD group (p=,025).
   The difficulties in understanding information in a quick and
   simultaneous way and integrating it coherently have been shown to be
   part of the neuropsychological profile of the PLD.
   Conclusion
   Our study provide a new correction an interpretation of the TM that
   evalautes Central coherence.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we provide the dataset associated with the research article
   ``Orientation patterns of aragonitic crossed-lamellar, fibrous prismatic
   and myostracal microstructures of modern Glycymeris shells{''}{[}1].
   Based on several tools (SEM, EBSD, laser confocal microscopy and FE-SEM)
   we present original data relative to the microstructure and texture of
   aragonite crystallites in all Glycymeris shell layers (crossed-lamellar,
   complex crossed-lamellar, fibrous prismatic and pedal retractor and
   adductor myostraca) and address texture characteristics at the
   transition from one layer to the other, identifying similarities and
   differences among the different layers. Shells were cut transversely,
   obliquely and longitudinally in order to obtain different orientated
   sections of the outer and inner layer and of the myostraca. The
   identification of major microstructural elements was provided by
   detailed SEM and laser confocal microscopy images. Microstructure and
   texture characterization was based on EBSD measurements presented as
   band contrast images and as color-coded crystal orientation maps with
   corresponding pole figures. Crystal co-orientation was measured with the
   MUD value. Finally, the distribution of the organic matrix occluded
   within the outer crossed-lamellar layer was revealed using FE-SEM. These
   data, besides providing a modern unaltered Glycymeris reference to
   detect diagenetic alteration in fossil analogs used for
   paleoenvironmental reconstructions, are useful to better comprehend the
   mechanisms of bivalve shell formation. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published

Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Chromosomal inversions play an important role in local adaptation.
   Inversions can capture multiple locally adaptive functional variants in
   a linked block by repressing recombination. However, this recombination
   suppression makes it difficult to identify the genetic mechanisms
   underlying an inversion's role in adaptation. In this study, we used
   large-scale transcriptomic data to dissect the functional importance of
   a 13 Mb inversion locus (Inv4m) found almost exclusively in highland
   populations of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays). Inv4m was introgressed into
   highland maize from the wild relative Zea mays ssp. mexicana, also
   present in the highlands of Mexico, and is thought to be important for
   the adaptation of these populations to cultivation in highland
   environments. However, the specific genetic variants and traits that
   underlie this adaptation are not known. We created two families
   segregating for the standard and inverted haplotypes of Inv4m in a
   common genetic background and measured gene expression effects
   associated with the inversion across 9 tissues in two experimental
   conditions. With these data, we quantified both the global
   transcriptomic effects of the highland Inv4m haplotype, and the local
   cis-regulatory variation present within the locus. We found diverse
   physiological effects of Inv4m across the 9 tissues, including a strong
   effect on the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis and
   chloroplast physiology. Although we could not confidently identify the
   causal alleles within Inv4m, this research accelerates progress towards
   understanding this inversion and will guide future research on these
   important genomic features.
   Author summary
   Chromosomal inversions are a type of structural variant commonly found
   to underlie local adaptation and speciation. However, in most cases we
   do not know what genes or genetic variants inside an inversion are
   important, and how any such variants regulate the associated adaptive
   traits. Fine-mapping genetic variants using forward genetics inside
   inversions is difficult because recombination between heterokayotypes
   are suppressed. In this study, we used gene expression as a tool to
   study the genetics of a large chromosomal inversion found in highland
   maize populations in Mexico called Inv4m. Gene expression analyses in 9
   tissues across two environmental conditions identified a large number of
   seemingly independent developmental and physiological processes
   regulated by Inv4m, suggesting that this locus contributes to local
   adaptation of maize to highland environments in multiple ways.}},

Abstract = {{Background There is a scarcity of data exploring the benefits of
   adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer
   in older women. We aimed to explore the effect of adding chemotherapy to
   local therapy on overall survival in older women with triple-negative
   breast cancer.
   Methods For this propensity-matched analysis, we used data from the
   National Cancer Database, a joint project of the Commission on Cancer of
   the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society. We
   included data from women aged 70 years or older with surgically treated,
   American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage I-III invasive
   triple-negative breast cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2014. Patients with
   T1aN0M0 disease and those with incomplete data on oestrogen receptor
   status, progesterone receptor status, or HER2 status were excluded. To
   reduce bias, patients were subdivided into three groups: those who were
   recommended chemotherapy but did not receive it; those who received
   chemotherapy; and those for whom chemotherapy was not recommended and
   not given. The primary outcome was overall survival. Multivariate Cox
   regression analysis and propensity score matching were done to minimise
   bias.
   Findings Between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec, 31, 2014, 16 062 women with
   triple-negative breast cancer in the database met the inclusion criteria
   for this analysis. Median follow-up was 38.3 months (IQR 20.7-46.1,
   range 0-138.0; 95\% CI 37.8-38.7). Collectively, the 5-year overall
   survival estimate of the 16 062 patients in the study cohort was 62.3\%
   (95\% CI 59.7-64.4). 5-year estimated overall survival was 68.5\% (95\%
   CI 66.4-70.6) for patients receiving chemotherapy, 61.1\% (59.0-63.2)
   for patients recommended but not given chemotherapy, and 53.7\%
   (51.8-55.8) for patients not recommended chemotherapy and not given
   chemotherapy (pooled log rank p<0.0001). Multivariate Cox regression
   analysis of a propensity score-matched sample comparing those who
   received chemotherapy with those who were recommended but not given
   chemotherapy (n=1884 matched pairs) identified improved overall survival
   with chemotherapy (hazard ratio {[}HR] 0.69 {[}95\% CI 0.60-0.80];
   p<0.0001). After stratifying the propensity score matching sample, this
   benefit persisted for node-negative women (HR 0.80 {[}95\% CI
   0.66-0.97]; p=0.007), node-positive women (0.76 {[}0.64-0.91]; p=0.006),
   and those with a comorbidity score greater than 0 (HR 0.74 {[}95\% CI
   0.59-0.94]; p=0.013).
   Interpretation These data support consideration of chemotherapy in the
   treatment of women aged 70 years or older with triple-negative breast
   cancer. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional objects as nanowires have been proven to be building
   blocks in novel applications due to their unique functionalities. In the
   realm of magnetic materials, iron-oxides form an important class by
   providing potential solutions in catalysis, magnetic devices, drug
   delivery, or in the field of sensors. The accurate composition and
   spatial structure analysis are crucial to describe the mechanical
   aspects and optimize strategies for the design of multi-component NWs.
   Atom probe tomography offers a unique analytic characterization tool to
   map the (re-)distribution of the constituents leading to a deeper
   insight into NW growth, thermally-assisted kinetics, and related
   mechanisms. As NW-based devices critically rely on the mechanical
   properties of NWs, the appropriate mechanical modeling with the
   resulting material constants is also highly demanded and can open novel
   ways to potential applications. Here, we report a compositional and
   structural study of quasi-ceramic one-dimensional objects: alpha-Fe
   circle plus alpha-FeOOH(goethite) circle plus Pt and alpha-Fe circle
   plus alpha-Fe3O4(magnetite) circle plus Pt core-shell NWs. We provide a
   theoretical model for the elastic behavior with terms accounting for the
   geometrical and mechanical nonlinearity, prior and subsequent to thermal
   treatment. The as-deposited system with a homogeneous distribution of
   the constituents demonstrates strikingly different structural and
   elastic features than that of after annealing, as observed by applying
   atom probe tomography, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, analytic electron
   microscopy, and a micromanipulator nanoprobe system. During annealing at
   a temperature of 350 degrees C for 20 h, (i) compositional partitioning
   between phases (alpha-Fe, alpha-Fe3O4 and in a minority of alpha-Fe2O3)
   in diffusional solid-solid phase transformations takes place, (ii) a
   distinct newly-formed shell formation develops, (iii) the degree of
   crystallinity increases and (iv) nanosized precipitation of evolving
   phases is detected leading to a considerable change in the description
   of the elastic material properties. The as-deposited nanowires already
   exhibit a significantly large maximum strain (1-8\%) and stress (3-13
   GPa) in moderately large bending tests, which become even more enhanced
   after the annealing treatment resulting at a maximum of about 2.5-10.5\%
   and 6-18 GPa, respectively. As a constitutive parameter, the
   strain-dependent stretch modulus undoubtedly represents changes in the
   material properties as the deformation progresses.}},

Abstract = {{Irradiation with ultra-short (femtosecond) laser beams enables the
   generation of sub-wavelength laser-induced periodic surface structures

   commercially available Nb foil samples affects their superconducting
   behavior. DC magnetization and AC susceptibility measurements at
   cryogenic temperatures and with magnetic fields of different amplitude
   and orientation are thus analyzed and reported. This study pays special
   attention to the surface superconducting layer that persists above the
   upper critical magnetic field strength H-c2, and disappears at a higher
   nucleation field strength H-c3. Characteristic changes were
   distinguished between the surface properties of the laser-irradiated
   samples, as compared to the corresponding reference samples
   (non-irradiated). Clear correlations have been observed between the
   surface nanostructures and the nucleation field H-c3, which depends on
   the relative orientation of the magnetic field and the surface patterns
   developed by the laser irradiation.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the football game in the physical education lesson offers
   particularly favorable conditions for the complex development of the
   students' motor skills and qualities. Playing the football game
   contributes to the formation and improvement of coordinated movements,
   to the capacity of rapid engagement in the timing and rhythm of social
   activities, through the accumulation of positive influences and effects
   of sanotrophic and educational character.
   Due to its valences, football is appreciated as a necessary and
   efficient means of physical school education, which is why we find it
   both in the physical education lessons or the obligatory activities of
   the students, as well as in the other sports-recreational activities in
   most schools in our country.
   By implementing in the process of preparation of dynamic games, sticks
   and competitions for students of 13-15 years we aim to consolidate and
   perfect the technique of football. By using these means during the
   training hours I suppose that the level of technical training of the
   students in the representative school football team for women will be
   improved.
   The importance of the different dynamic games, of the sticks and of the
   competitions in the acquisition of the football game technique lies in
   the fact that, in the modern game, performance cannot be achieved
   without a very good technique.}},

Title = {{A zinc finger family protein, ZNF263, promotes hepatocellular carcinoma
   resistance to apoptosis via activation of ER stress-dependent autophagy}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer
   death worldwide. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is generally
   activated in HCC and is important for the sensitivity of HCC to
   anticancer drugs. ERS-dependent autophagy is a crucial mechanism
   affecting the sensitivity of HCC to anticancer drugs, but the mechanism
   by which ERS regulates autophagy is not well understood. Zinc finger
   protein 263 (ZNF263) is a transcription factor member of the zinc finger
   family. However, its functional role in HCC remains to be studied. In
   the current study, we investigated the role of ZNF263 in regulating
   ERS-induced chemoresistance in HCC and its possible mechanism. We found
   that ZNF263 was the most significant ERS-specific super-enhancer
   bounding transcriptional factor and was up-regulated in HCC patients and
   cell lines. Further, ZNF263 expression correlated with ERS, clinical
   stage and shorter survival in HCC patients. ZNF263 knockdown by RNA
   interference results in decreased proliferation, apoptosis resistance,
   and chemoresistance. Further study showed that ZNF263 increased
   chemoresistance by activating ERS-related autophagy. In conclusion, our
   study highlights ZNF263 as a functional ERS-related tumor activator and
   indicates it as a potential target for HCC therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular flexibility and emulsifying properties of soy protein
   isolate (SPI) and soy protein isolate-glucose (SPI-G) conjugates after

   increased significantly (P < 0.05). After ultrasonic treatment, the
   particle size of the protein was reduced and the protein structure

   that both the ultrasonic treatment and Maillard reaction process could
   stretch the structure and increase the flexibility of SPI molecules.

Title = {{Mechanical enhancement of hydrophobically associating hydrogels by
   solvent-regulated phase separation}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{210}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogels have a wide range of potential applications due to their
   unique soft and hydrated structure. Many applications, however, require
   an efficient combination of mechanical properties including strength,
   stiffness, toughness, and viscoelasticity, which is rarely achieved. In
   this work, we report the simultaneously strengthening, stiffening, and
   toughening of a conventionally weak gel, hydrophobically associating
   hydrogel, by a simple regulation of external solvent. Phase separation
   is induced when the hydrogel is immersed into the mixed solvent that has
   a relatively high concentration of a poor solvent, resulting in the
   increment of polymer volume fraction in the gel. As a result, strong
   inter/intra polymer interactions emerge at the nanoscale, which serve
   the role of sacrificial bonds to dissipate large amounts of energy. The
   phase-separated, viscoelastic hydrogel exhibits significant enhancements
   in strength, stiffness, and toughness by up to 270-, 9200-, and
   2500-folds, respectively, exceeding a great many tough hydrogels.
   Periodically changing the solvent enables the reversible phase
   separation process, facilitating the regulation of mechanical properties
   of the hydrogel upon demand. This solvent-regulated phase-separation
   strategy, due to its facile procedure, repeatability, and high
   efficiency, offers a universal guideline to toughen weak hydrogels.}},

Abstract = {{Exploiting novel triboelectric nanogenerator (TENGs) with merits of high
   environmental adaptability, structural sustainability and multimode
   operating has gaied increasing attention. In this work, a conductive
   sponge (CS) electrode-brush-structured TENG is reported for the first
   time as a dual-mode mechanical energy harvester and self-powered sensor.
   The CS, prepared via a route of chemical plating followed with
   electroplating, has an interconnected porous network structure with high
   flexibility, elasticity and surface area. The implemented CS based TENGs
   in both contact-separation and sliding mode achieve a high electrical
   performance, excellent mechanical response sensitivity, and
   environmental adaptability. Besides, a trajectory tracking sensor matrix
   has been demonstrated based on CS units. The superior real-time
   monitoring and integral trajectory recording, as well as the unique
   self-power, indicate the CS-based TENG has great potential in
   self-powered trajectory tracking. This study introduces a new TENG
   configuration that reveals a remarkable performance in energy harvesting
   and self-powered sensing, which provides a new approach to the future
   intelligent technology.}},

Abstract = {{For decades, a variety of task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) data
   analysis approaches have been developed, including the general linear
   model (GLM), sparse representations, and independent component analysis
   (ICA). However, these methods are mainly shallow models and are limited
   in faithfully modeling the complex, diverse, and concurrent
   spatial-temporal functional brain activities. Recently, recurrent neural
   networks (RNNs) have demonstrated great superiority in modeling temporal
   dependency of signals, while autoencoder models have been proven to be
   effective in automatically estimating the optimal representations of the
   original data. These characteristics of RNNs and autoencoders naturally
   meet the requirement of modeling hemodynamic response patterns in tfMRI
   data. Thus, we propose a novel unsupervised framework of deep recurrent
   autoencoder (DRAE) for modeling hemodynamic response patterns in this
   article. The basic idea of the DRAE model is to combine the deep RNN and
   the autoencoder to automatically characterize the meaningful functional
   brain networks and corresponding diverse and complex hemodynamic
   response patterns simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate
   the superiority of the proposed DRAE model in automatically estimating
   the diverse and complex hemodynamic response patterns.}},

   Campylobacter jejuni Colonization in the Intestine}},
Journal = {{VACCINES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Campylobacter jejuni is the leading bacterial cause of human enteritis
   in developed countries. Chicken is the major animal reservoir of C.
   jejuni and a powerful infection model for human campylobacteriosis. No
   commercial vaccine against C. jejuni is available to date. The high
   affinity iron acquisition mediated through enterobactin (Ent), a small
   siderophore, plays a critical role in the colonization of C. jejuni in
   the intestine. Recently, an innovative Ent conjugate vaccine has been
   demonstrated to induce high-level of Ent-specific antibodies in rabbits;
   the Ent-specific antibodies displayed potent binding ability to Ent and
   inhibited Ent-dependent growth of C. jejuni. In this study, using
   specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, we performed three trials to
   evaluate the immunogenicity of the Ent conjugate vaccine and its
   efficacy to control C. jejuni colonization in the intestine. The
   purified Ent was conjugated to the carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin
   (KLH). Intramuscular immunization of chickens with the Ent-KLH conjugate
   for up to three times did not affect the body weight gain, the
   development of major immune organs and the gut microbiota. In the first
   two trials, immunizations of chickens with different regimens (two or
   three times of vaccination) consistently induced strong Ent-specific
   immune response when compared to control group. Consistent with the
   high-level of systemic anti-Ent IgG, C. jejuni colonization was
   significantly reduced by 3-4 log(10) units in the cecum in two
   independent vaccination trials. The third trial demonstrated that single
   Ent-KLH vaccination is sufficient to elicit high level of systemic
   Ent-specific antibodies, which could persist for up to eight weeks in
   chickens. Taken together, the Ent-KLH conjugate vaccine could induce
   high-level of Ent-specific antibodies in chickens and confer host
   protection against C. jejuni colonization, which provides a novel
   strategy for Campylobacter control in poultry and humans.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses three dimensions of the problem of access to
   water in rural communities in the Brazilian semi-arid region:
   theoretical, public and distributive. It is argued that the main
   perspectives used to frame the water problem in the region - be it the
   global water crisis, the social construction of the drought disaster or
   ``living with the semi-arid region{''} - represent different versions of
   a ``supply paradigm{''}, in which insufficient water supply gives
   meaning to the social situations to be faced. Thus, an analysis is
   performed on the patterns of access to drinking water for human supply
   that resulted from actions carried out under two public programs aimed
   at increasing the supply of water in the rural communities through the
   construction of cisterns to collect rain water and the implementation of
   saline or underground water desalination systems: One million Rural
   Cisterns (P1MC) and the Agua Doce Program. Finally, a perspective is
   advocated that emphasizes distributional issues, highlighting
   inequalities of different types and allowing a new territorialization of
   the problem of access to water in the Northeast, breaking the dichotomy
   between rural and urban to signify the problem of access to water as
   structural inequalities, experienced daily, which makes it possible to
   reveal latent environmental conflicts, to be overcome from the political
   mobilization around the notion of water citizenship.}},

Title = {{Aboveground biomass corresponds strongly with drone-derived canopy
   height but weakly with greenness (NDVI) in a shrub tundra landscape}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Arctic landscapes are changing rapidly in response to warming, but
   future predictions are hindered by difficulties in scaling ecological
   relationships from plots to biomes. Unmanned aerial systems (hereafter
   `drones') are increasingly used to observe Arctic ecosystems over
   broader extents than can be measured using ground-based approaches and
   are facilitating the interpretation of coarse-grained remotely sensed
   data. However, more information is needed about how drone-acquired
   remote sensing observations correspond with ecosystem attributes such as
   aboveground biomass. Working across a willow shrub-dominated alluvial
   fan at a focal study site in the Canadian Arctic, we conducted peak
   growing season drone surveys with an RGB camera and a multispectral
   multi-camera array. We derived photogrammetric reconstructions of canopy
   height and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps along with
   in situ point-intercept measurements and aboveground vascular biomass
   harvests from 36, 0.25 m(2) plots. We found high correspondence between
   canopy height measured using in situ point-intercept methods compared to
   drone-photogrammetry (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.808),
   although the photogrammetry heights were positively biased by 0.14 m
   relative to point-intercept heights. Canopy height was strongly and
   linearly related to aboveground biomass, with similar coefficients of
   determination for point-intercept (R-2 = 0.92) and drone-based methods
   (R-2 = 0.90). NDVI was positively related to aboveground biomass,
   phytomass and leaf biomass. However, NDVI only explained a small
   proportion of the variance in biomass (R-2 between 0.14 and 0.23 for
   logged total biomass) and we found moss cover influenced the
   NDVI-phytomass relationship. Vascular plant biomass is challenging to
   infer from drone-derived NDVI, particularly in ecosystems where
   bryophytes cover a large proportion of the land surface. Our findings
   suggest caution with broadly attributing change in fine-grained NDVI to
   biomass differences across biologically and topographically complex
   tundra landscapes. By comparing structural, spectral and on-the-ground
   ecological measurements, we can improve understanding of tundra
   vegetation change as inferred from remote sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Algeria has high wildfire activity, albeit restricted to the northern
   coastal fringe. However, no study has investigated why fire is
   restricted to that area, and what combination of factors explains the
   occurrence of wildfires. Here, we describe the current fire regime of
   Northern Algeria from 2000 to 2019 and we correlate fire activity to a
   range of environmental and anthropic drivers. We found a strong
   north-south gradient in fire occurrence: it is maximal in the
   high-fueled (productive) oak forests of Northern Algeria with high
   annual rainfall amount, whereas it is fuel-limited in the South due to
   semi-arid conditions. We determined that fire is nearly absent where the
   bioclimate is subarid or arid, due to the steppic vegetation with summer
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values below 0.35.
   Therefore, fire occupies a narrow niche in space (the humid and subhumid
   areas with high productivity) and in time as most fires occur in summer
   after the high rainfalls from fall to spring that promote fuel growth.
   Humans also play a role as fire hotspots are concentrated in croplands
   and in built-up areas with high human density and infrastructures mixed
   with shrublands and forests. We discuss how the ongoing climate changes
   and the desertification progressing towards the North of Algeria may
   finally restrict forests to a narrow fringe providing less and less
   ecological services to the Algerian people.}},

Title = {{Total mercury in commercial fishes and estimation of Brazilian dietary
   exposure to methylmercury}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{62}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mercury, in particular its most toxic form methylmercury,
   poses a risk to public health. Dietary methylmercury exposure is mainly
   by fish, and it can vary with fish contamination and by dietary habits
   of the population. This study aimed to quantify total mercury levels in
   different fish from Brazil and to estimate Brazilian exposure to
   methylmercury by fish consumption.
   Methods: Total mercury occurrence was investigated in 18 different fish
   species by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition and
   gold amalgamation. Dietary exposure to methylmercury was estimated by a
   deterministic method for different groups considering consumption by
   sex, different Brazilian geographical regions and habitat (rural or
   urban).
   Results: Carnivorous fish showed higher levels of mercury (0.01 to 0.93
   mg/kg) compared to non-strictly carnivorous fish (<0.01 to 0.30 mg/kg).
   Farmed fishes showed significantly lower levels compared to wild fish.
   Mean Brazilian fish consumption achieves FAO/WHO health recommendation
   of about two portions of fish per week. However, there is a large
   difference between fish consumption at urban and rural homes and among
   Brazilian geographic regions. These differences in consumption impacted
   estimated methylmercury intake that was higher in the Northern (1.85 mu
   g/kg bw week) and in the Northeastern (0.72 mu g/kg bw week) regions and
   also by rural population (1.08 mu g/kg bw week). These values were
   compared with the toxicological reference dose for neurotoxicity of 1.6
   mu g/kg bw week.
   Conclusion: Even though total levels of mercury in fish were lower than
   Brazilian and international legislations, in the Northern Brazilian
   region methylmercury intake overpassed the toxicological reference dose
   for neurotoxicity and in rural areas it achieved 68\% of this reference
   dose.}},

Abstract = {{This paper was a part of studies conducted within an island population
   of the ragwort Senecio umbrosus (White Mt, southeastern Poland), a
   vulnerable element of xerothermic grasslands. Special attention was paid
   to the effects of expansive grass encroachment vs. grassland burning
   episodes on spatiotemporal patterns and life-stage structure of
   individuals in the population. The population traits were investigated
   nine times from 1990 to 2010, within three permanent patches differing
   in soil properties, initial floristic composition, grassland cover
   (particularly the cover of Brachypodium pinnatum), ragwort cover and
   density, shrub/tree cover influencing light intensity (full
   light-shadow), and grassland burning (zero-six episodes). There was a
   drastic decline in ragwort abundance within all the study patches
   accompanied by a decrease in the population clustering coefficient and a
   gradual equalization of the spatial distribution of ramets. The
   abundance was negatively correlated (PCA analysis) with an increase in
   B. pinnatum cover and positively correlated with the number of burning
   episodes, which temporarily delimited persistent litter cover and
   facilitated recruitment of new individuals. The decrease in ramet
   abundance ranged from 3.8 times (medium-high, moderately shadowed
   grassland; six cases of burning) to 8.3 times (high, dense, and shadowed
   grassland; four cases of burning). The patch of low, loose, sunlit, and
   never-burned grassland with the greatest initial density of ragwort (a
   6.8-fold decrease in abundance) has evolved with time into a high and
   dense grassland with a greater coverage of B. pinnatum and Calamagrostis
   epigejos, additionally shaded by shrubs and young trees.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The majority of cases of listeriosis are associated with the consumption
   of contaminated food. Some strains of Listeria monocytogenes can persist
   over months or years in meat processing plants increasing the risk of
   product contamination. The presence of L. monocytogenes was examined in
   10 dry-cured ham processing facilities. A total of 1801 samples were
   collected from environment and equipment, during processing (1095) and
   after cleaning and disinfection (706). These samples were taken from
   non-food contact (736) and food contact (1065) surfaces. In addition,
   204 samples from ham surfaces were also analysed. Prevalence varied from
   6\% to 34\% among facilities, and was higher during processing than
   after cleaning and disinfection (24.8\% vs 11.0\%) and from non-food
   than from food contact surfaces (22.6\% vs 17.4\%). L. monocytogenes
   semtype 1/2a was predominant (53.9\%), followed by 1/2c (26.0\%) and
   1/2b (15.3\%) and less frequently 4b (4.8\%). A total of 142 different
   pulsotypes were registered. Potential persistent L. monocytogenes
   strains were isolated in 9 out the 10 facilities, with no more than 6
   pulsotypes in a given plant. Two pulsotypes were common in different
   installations, detected before and after cleaning and disinfection,
   highlighting the importance of monitoring the presence of this pathogen
   in dry-cured ham processing environments.}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of pulse flours with higher dietary fiber content in
   bakery products, such as chickpea (Cicer arietinum L) flour, has been
   exploited by the food industry due to its nutritional and sensory
   characteristics. This work aimed to develop a sandwich bread with a
   partial substitution (7.5\%, 15\%, and 30\%) of refined wheat flour by
   whole chickpea flour (WCF) and also to evaluate the effects on sensory
   acceptance, physicochemical parameters, and texture profile during the
   shelf life. Four methods for obtaining WCF were assessed and the best
   condition was used to produce the sandwich bread. Sensory evaluation was
   carried out with 65 consumers using a 9-point hedonic scale and a
   purchase intention scale. Firmness, elasticity, cohesiveness,
   chewability, and fracturability was evaluated by the Texture Profile
   Analysis (TPA). The specific volume, total fungi count, pH, titratable
   acidity, and moisture content were also determined. The nutritional
   composition was estimated by mass balance. Data demonstrated that there
   was no difference (p>0.05) in sensory evaluation of the products
   elaborated with different concentrations of WCF, and all samples
   presented good acceptance. The addition of WCF did not cause negative
   effects on the texture and volume characteristics of the bread. The
   sample with 30\% WCF had adequate technological characteristics,
   resulting in a product with higher nutritional value, especially dietary
   fiber, and was well accepted by the consumers. This formulation can be
   used by the food industry and also in domestic preparations,
   contributing to the diversification and nutritional enrichment of
   sandwich bread.}},

Abstract = {{Diversity of species within Aspergillus niger clade, currently
   represented by A. niger sensu stricto and A. welwitshiae, was
   investigated combining three-locus gene sequences, Random Amplified
   Polymorphic DNA, secondary metabolites profile and morphology. Firstly,
   approximately 700 accessions belonging to this clade were investigated
   using calmodulin gene sequences. Based on these sequences, eight
   haplotypes were clearly identified as A. niger (n = 247) and 17 as A.
   welwitschiae (n = 403). However, calmodulin sequences did not provide
   definitive species identities for six haplotypes. To elucidate the
   taxonomic position of these haplotypes, two other loci, part of the
   beta-tubulin gene and part of the RNA polymerase II gene, were sequenced
   and used to perform an analysis of Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic
   Species Recognition. This analysis enabled the recognition of two new
   phylogenetic species. One of the new phylogenetic species showed
   morphological and chemical distinguishable features in comparison to the
   known species A. welwitschiae and A. niger. This species is illustrated
   and described as Aspergillus vinaceus sp. nov. In contrast to A. niger
   and A. welwitschiae, A. vinaceus strains produced asperazine, but none
   of them were found to produce ochratoxin A and/or fumonisins. Sclerotium
   production on laboratory media, which does not occur in strains of A.
   niger and A. welwitschiae, and strictly sclerotium-associated secondary
   metabolites (14-Epi-hydroxy-10,23-dihydro-24,25-dehydroaflavinine;

Title = {{Influence of flavored drinking water on voluntary intake and performance
   of nursing and post-weaned piglets}},
Journal = {{LIVESTOCK SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{242}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Water is an absolute requirement in the daily needs of the pig. It has
   been suggested that when sows have a limited milk production, piglets
   may not consume enough water which will impact on their hydration.
   Eighty mixed parity sows of a high prolificacy genetic line were used to
   evaluate the impact of a flavor added to the drinking water for piglets
   on the voluntary water intake and performance during nursing phase and
   first week post-weaning. Sows and their respective litters were
   distributed in a completely randomized experimental design among the
   four treatments according to parity order and body weight 24 h
   post-farrowing. The treatments represented by control where piglets
   received standard water (T1) and other three levels of flavor inclusion
   in the water (T2 = 100 ppm; T3 = 200 ppm and T4 = 400 ppm). Piglets were
   allowed free access to water treatments via a semi-automatic water
   dispenser from d 3 until weaning (approx. 21 day). At weaning a total of
   936 piglets were weighed, selected and distributed in a completely
   randomized experimental block design among treatments in the nursery
   pens according to weight (light, moderate and heavy), sex (male and
   female) and previous lactation treatment. The piglets were housed in the
   nursery facilities and were continuously offered the same four
   treatments that were used during the lactation phase until 7-day
   post-weaning. The flavor added to the drinking water significantly
   increased the piglets water (P = 0.047) and creep feed (P = 0.001)
   intake, which impacted positively on piglet average daily gain, and
   piglet weaning weight during the nursing phase. Treatments also
   influenced piglets' nursery voluntary total water (P = 0.0001) and total
   feed consumption (P = 0.002). Also the piglets' total average weight
   gain (P = 0.042), and pen daily gain (P = 0.003) and final weight (P =
   0.0001) were influenced by the water flavor. In conclusion, this
   experiment has demonstrated that the inclusion of flavor compounds in
   the drinking water of the piglets during nursing and post-weaning phases
   has the potential to improve piglet performance. Our findings lead us to
   believe that the strategic use of a water flavor to manipulate the
   sensorial properties of water is a viable strategy to increase the
   piglet's voluntary water and feed intake and as a consequence improve
   litter performance at weaning and during the first week post weaning all
   of which can help prepare the animal for the negative effects of the
   weaning process.}},

Title = {{Revealing the Metabolic Flexibility of ``Candidatus Accumulibacter
   phosphatis{''} through Redox Cofactor Analysis and Metabolic Network
   Modeling}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Environmental fluctuations in the availability of nutrients lead to
   intricate metabolic strategies. ``Candidatus Accumulibacter
   phosphatis,{''} a polyphosphate-accumulating organism (PAO) responsible
   for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) from wastewater
   treatment systems, is prevalent in aerobic/anaerobic environments. While
   the overall metabolic traits of these bacteria are well described, the
   nonavailability of isolates has led to controversial conclusions on the
   metabolic pathways used. In this study, we experimentally determined the
   redox cofactor preferences of different oxidoreductases in the central
   carbon metabolism of a highly enriched ``Ca. Accumulibacter
   phosphatis{''} culture. Remarkably, we observed that the acetoacetyl
   coenzyme A reductase engaged in polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthesis is
   NADH preferring instead of showing the generally assumed NADPH
   dependency. This allows rethinking of the ecological role of PHA
   accumulation as a fermentation product under anaerobic conditions and
   not just a stress response. Based on previously published metaomics data
   and the results of enzymatic assays, a reduced central carbon metabolic
   network was constructed and used for simulating different metabolic
   operating modes. In particular, scenarios with different
   acetate-to-glycogen consumption ratios were simulated, which
   demonstrated optima using different combinations of glycolysis,
   glyoxylate shunt, or branches of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
   Thus, optimal metabolic flux strategies will depend on the environment
   (acetate uptake) and on intracellular storage compound availability
   (polyphosphate/glycogen). This NADH-related metabolic flexibility is
   enabled by the NADH-driven PHA synthesis. It allows for maintaining
   metabolic activity under various environmental substrate conditions,
   with high carbon conservation and lower energetic costs than for
   NADPH-dependent PHA synthesis. Such (flexible) metabolic redox coupling
   can explain the competitiveness of PAOs under oxygen-fluctuating
   environments.
   IMPORTANCE Here, we demonstrate how microbial storage metabolism can
   adjust to a wide range of environmental conditions. Such flexibility
   generates a selective advantage under fluctuating environmental
   conditions. It can also explain the different observations reported in
   PAO literature, including the capacity of ``Ca. Accumulibacter
   phosphatis{''} to act like glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs). These
   observations stem from slightly different experimental conditions, and
   controversy arises only when one assumes that metabolism can operate
   only in a single mode. Furthermore, we also show how the study of
   metabolic strategies is possible when combining omits data with
   functional cofactor assays and modeling. Genomic information can only
   provide the potential of a microorganism. The environmental context and
   other complementary approaches are still needed to study and predict the
   functional expression of such metabolic potential.}},

Abstract = {{The allelopathic action can be verified by the presence of phytotoxic
   substances, molecules that are directed to the agribusiness sector. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the chemical composition of the
   methanolic extracts from Colletotrichum dianesei and Xylaria sp., and
   phytotoxic potential on Lactuca sativa. The fungi were grown in
   Sabouraud liquid medium supplemented with 0.2\% yeast extract, under
   stirring. The mycelia were subjected to solvent extraction in order of
   increasing polarity, but methanol extracts were used in this
   investigation. The allelopathic activity was evaluated at a
   concentration of 1000 mu g/mL in quadruplicate, evaluating: percentage
   and speed of germination, and growth of lettuce seedlings under
   laboratory conditions. C. dianesei extract reduced germination
   percentage by 36\% and delayed germination speed by 63.8\%, while
   Xylaria sp. didn't interfere with the germination percentage, it only
   delayed the germination rate by 43.9\%. Root growth was negatively
   affected in 30.5\% and 51.1\% under the influence of extracts from
   Xylaria sp. and C. dianesei, there was also a reduction of 33.1 and
   31.8\% in the aerial part length, respectively. The thin layer
   chromatography showed the presence of aromatic substances and terpenes
   in both extracts, and alkaloids only in C. dianesei extract. The H-1 NMR
   spectra showed signals between 6 and 8.5 ppm (aromatic substances),
   being relatively more intense for Xylaria sp., signals between 3 and 4
   ppm (sugars, showing anomers only for Xylaria sp.) and methyl groups
   between 0.7 and 1.3 ppm, suggesting terpenes. The results suggest that
   the fungal species evaluated have phytotoxic potential, and produce
   terpenes and aromatic substances.}},

Abstract = {{The channel modeling of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based free-space
   optical (FSO) links with nonzero boresight pointing error is the subject
   of this paper. In particular, utilizing log-normal turbulence model, we
   propose a novel closed-form statistical channel model for UAV-based FSO
   links that takes into account the effect of nonzero boresight pointing
   errors. Subsequently, utilizing Gamma-Gamma turbulence model, we propose
   a novel channel characterization for such links that is valid under
   moderate to strong turbulence conditions. The accuracy of the proposed
   models is verified via Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed models are
   more tractable and suitable for analysis of such UAV-based FSO links.}},

Abstract = {{(Ce,Gd,Nd,Sm,Pr)O2-delta and (Ce,Gd,La,Nd,Pr)O2-delta rare-earth
   high-entropy oxides (HEOx) with the oxygen vacancy-ordered Ia-3
   structure are doped with a small amount of molybdenum, to prepare two
   series of materials, (Ce,Gd,Nd,Sm,Pr,Mo-x)O2-delta and
   (Ce,Gd,Nd,Sm,Pr,Mo,)O2-delta with x = (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5). The
   first-ever stabilization of the fluorite-type Fm-3m structure (i.e. with
   disordered vacancies) in the ceria-based HEOx is achieved. Structural,
   microstructural and transport properties of the compounds are
   systematically studied. The substitution level of x >= 0.3 allows to
   fully stabilize Fm-3m symmetry, with samples exhibiting good
   homogeneity. Influence of Mo on the oxygen vacancy concentration and
   charge state of the elements is studied with the use of Raman
   spectroscopy and XPS methods, showing decrease of the vacancy content
   and dominating presence of Mo6+, Ce4+ and mixed Pr3+/4+ states. Measured
   for the first time in this group of materials, the electrical
   conductivity of the Mo-doped oxides indicates the mixed ionic-electronic
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{A 52-year-old man presented with lower urinary tract symptoms and

   intravesical extension of the migrated mesh along the right
   anterolateral wall. The entire intravesical part of the migrated mesh
   with encrustations was successfully retrieved by endourological approach
   using holmium laser. The patient symptomatically improved and at
   follow-up, cystoscopy showed a complete re-epithelisation of the bladder
   mucosa. The intravesical extension of migrated mesh is a rare but
   challenging complication following mesh hernioplasty and can be
   successfully managed with a complete endoscopic approach.}},

Title = {{From Infrared Spectra to Macroscopic Mechanical Properties of sH Gas
   Hydrates through Atomistic Calculations}},
Journal = {{MOLECULES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The vibrational characteristics of gas hydrates are key identifying
   molecular features of their structure and chemical composition. Density
   functional theory (DFT)-based IR spectra are one of the efficient tools
   that can be used to distinguish the vibrational signatures of gas
   hydrates. In this work, ab initio DFT-based IR technique is applied to
   analyze the vibrational and mechanical features of structure-H (sH) gas
   hydrate. IR spectra of different sH hydrates are obtained at 0 K at
   equilibrium and under applied pressure. Information about the main
   vibrational modes of sH hydrates and the factors that affect them such
   as guest type and pressure are revealed. The obtained IR spectra of sH
   gas hydrates agree with experimental/computational literature values.
   Hydrogen bond's vibrational frequencies are used to determine the
   hydrate's Young's modulus which confirms the role of these bonds in
   defining sH hydrate's elasticity. Vibrational frequencies depend on
   pressure and hydrate's O center dot center dot center dot O interatomic
   distance. OH vibrational frequency shifts are related to the OH covalent
   bond length and present an indication of sH hydrate's hydrogen bond
   strength. This work presents a new route to determine mechanical
   properties for sH hydrate based on IR spectra and contributes to the
   relatively small database of gas hydrates' physical and vibrational
   properties.}},

Title = {{To what extent should farm households diversify? Implications on
   multidimensional poverty in Ghana}},
Journal = {{WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Livelihood diversification is a widely used approach to address economic
   disruptions and as a measure to mitigate poverty. Despite a raging
   debate about whether households should specialize or diversify their
   livelihood activities in order to minimize poverty, a number of
   country-level studies suggest greater diversification of livelihood
   activities, although there is insufficient evidence to support these
   positions. The livelihood decision-making of the farm household is not
   limited to choosing between specialization and diversification, but
   rather to choosing a combination of both. This raises the question of
   the degree of diversification that leads to the best outcomes in poverty
   reduction. Using the 2017 Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS7) from
   14,009 households, we assessed the role of livelihood diversification in
   reducing multidimensional poverty in Ghana. The study used the Margalef
   index to construct livelihood diversification matrix, while the quantile
   regression model applied to estimate the determinants of livelihood
   diversification. We also used the Alkire-Foster multidimensional poverty
   framework to generate a multidimensional poverty index as a household
   poverty indicator, and we estimated the impact of each quantile of
   livelihood diversification on poverty using the
   Inverse-probability-weighted Regression Adjustment (IPWRA) estimator.
   The significant impact of diversification over specialization reflects
   the results of the study, but at the lower and middle quantile for crop
   diversification and higher quantile for income diversification. Thus,
   while diversification lessens household poverty, the extent and
   dimension of diversification is important. Therefor, sustained promotion
   of involvement in non-farm income-generating activities is essential to
   poverty reduction.}},

Title = {{Assessing the Climate Impact of Formation Flights}},
Journal = {{AEROSPACE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An operational measure that is inspired by migrant birds aiming toward
   the mitigation of aviation climate impact is to fly in aerodynamic
   formation. When this operational measure is adapted to commercial
   aircraft it saves fuel and is, therefore, expected to reduce the climate
   impact of aviation. Besides the total emission amount, this mitigation
   option also changes the location of emissions, impacting the non-CO2
   climate effects arising from NOx and H2O emissions and contrails. Here,
   we assess these non-CO2 climate impacts with a climate response model to
   assure a benefit for climate not only due to CO2 emission reductions,
   but also due to reduced non-CO2 effects. Therefore, the climate response
   model AirClim is used, which includes CO2 effects and also the impact of
   water vapor and contrail induced cloudiness as well as the impact of
   nitrogen dioxide emissions on the ozone and methane concentration. For
   this purpose, AirClim has been adopted to account for saturation effects
   occurring for formation flight. The results of the case studies show
   that the implementation of formation flights in the 50 most popular
   airports for the year 2017 display an average decrease of fuel
   consumption by 5\%. The climate impact, in terms of average near surface
   temperature change, is estimated to be reduced in average by 24\%, with
   values of individual formations between 13\% and 33\%.}},

Title = {{Recovery of gamma-oryzanol from rice bran oil soapstock derived calcium
   soap: Consideration of Hansen solubility parameters and preferential

Abstract = {{This study aimed to develop an effective procedure for the recovery of
   gamma-oryzanol through calcium (Ca)-induced precipitation of rice bran
   oil soapstock (RBOS), a by-product of the RBO industry. The most
   suitable pretreatment condition was found to be saponification with
   sodium hydroxide at 2x the saponification value, 90 degrees C for 40
   min, providing 100\% and 63.5\% conversion of triglycerides and free
   fatty acids, respectively, and a 79.4\% gamma-oryzanol yield. Addition
   of calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution at 0.3 g CaCl2:1 g of sodium soap
   (Na-FA) effectively induced the precipitation of
   gamma-oryzanol-containing calcium soap (Ca-FA). Based on experimental
   solubility measurements, theoretical Hansen solubility parameters
   (HSPs), and a preferential extractability study, the most suitable
   extraction solvents were suggested to be ethyl acetate and furfural.
   Ethyl acetate gave a gamma-oryzanol selective extractability and
   recovery of 55.4\% and 59.3\%, respectively, whilst those for furfural
   were 55.3\% and 62.8\%, respectively. In addition to obtaining a high
   gamma-oryzanol yield in a relatively simple and energy efficient
   process, Ca-FA residue, a high price animal feed supplement, was also
   obtained by this proposed process.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the invasive potential of an exotic scale insect associated

Abstract = {{The movement of invasive species is a global threat to ecosystems and
   economies. Scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccoidea) are particularly
   well-suited to avoid detection, invade new habitats, and escape control
   efforts. In countries that celebrate Christmas, the annual movement of
   Christmas trees has in at least one instance been associated with the
   invasion of a scale insect pest and subsequent devastation of indigenous
   forest species. In the eastern United States, except for Florida,
   Fiorinia externa is a well-established exotic scale insect pest of
   keystone hemlock species and Fraser fir Christmas trees. Annually,
   several hundred thousand Fraser firs are harvested and shipped into
   Florida, USA for sale to homeowners and businesses. There is concern
   that this insect may disperse from Christmas trees and establish on
   Florida conifers of economic and conservation interest. Here, we
   investigate the invasive potential of F. externa on sixteen conifer
   species by quantifying the reproductive potential of this insect pest
   and its ability to establish, reproduce, and damage these plants. We
   find that small amounts of heavily infested Fraser fir plant material
   can release several hundred juvenile F. externa for over a month.
   Similar to other case studies, we find evidence that host susceptibility
   may in part be linked to phylogenetic relatedness. Encouragingly, only
   six of sixteen species evaluated were susceptible to attack. Our results
   provide new insights into methodology for evaluating scale insect
   dispersal and host susceptibility. We also provide guidance for future
   studies investigating scale insect reproduction, dispersal, and risk for
   plant species of unknown susceptibility to other exotic insect pests.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To test whether administration of prasugrel after coronary
   artery bypass grafting (CABG) reduces saphenous vein graft (SVG)
   thrombosis. Use of aspirin after CABG improves graft patency, but
   administration of other antiplatelet agents has yielded equivocal
   results. Methods. We performed a double-blind trial randomizing patients
   to prasugrel or placebo after CABG at four United States centers. Almost
   all patients were receiving aspirin. Follow-up angiography, optical
   coherence tomography (OCT), intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and
   near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) were performed at 12 months. The
   primary efficacy endpoint was prevalence of OCT-detected SVG thrombus.
   The primary safety endpoint was incidence of Global Utilization of
   Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) severe
   bleeding. Results. The study was stopped early due to slow enrollment
   after randomizing 84 patients. Mean age was 64 +/- 6 years; 98\% of the
   patients were men. Follow-up angiography was performed in 59 patients.
   IVUS was performed in 52 patients, OCT in 53 patients, and NIRS in 33
   patients. Thrombus was identified by OCT in 56\% vs 50\% of patients in
   the prasugrel vs placebo groups, respectively (P=.78). Angiographic SVG
   failure occurred in 24\% of patients in the prasugrel arm vs 40\% in the
   placebo arm (P=.19). The 1-year incidence of major adverse
   cardiovascular events was 14.3\% vs 2.4\% in the prasugrel and placebo
   groups, respectively (P=.20), without significant differences in GUSTO
   severe bleeding (P=.32). Conclusion. Early SVG failure occurred in
   approximately one-third of patients. Prasugrel did not decrease
   prevalence of SVG thrombus 12 months after CABG.}},

Abstract = {{Feed efficiency is essential for dairy cows because it can increase
   production and quality of milk, and reduce methane emissions in the
   environment. One of the strategies to increase feed efficiency is using
   rumen modifier. Essential oils have antimicrobial activities and have
   been used as rumen modifier in dairy cows. The aim of this paper is to
   review several studies on the utilization of essential oils as feed
   additive to enhance milk production and quality of dairy cow. Based on
   some research reports, using essential oils which contained thymol,
   eugenol, cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol in dairy cattle feed decreased the
   population of protozoa, methanogens, proteolytic, and biohydrogenase
   bacteria. The impact of modulating rumen microbial population has led to
   optimal rumen fermentation resulted in the efficiency of carbohydrate,
   protein, and fat utilizations. It can be concluded that essential oils
   are potential as rumen modifier by inhibit methanogenesis, increase asam
   propionate, energy efficiency and ruminal by pass protein. The
   inconsistent results on milk production and milk fat requires further
   research to study deeper the effect of dosage and type of essential oils
   on dairy cows performance.}},

Title = {{How Initial Forest Cover, Site Characteristics and Fire Severity Drive
   the Dynamics of the Southern Boreal Forest}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires are a key driver of boreal landscape dynamics and are
   expected to increase with climate change in the coming decades. A
   profound understanding of the effects of fire upon boreal forest
   dynamics is thus critically needed for our ability to manage these
   ecosystems and conserve their services. In the present study, we
   investigate the long-term post-fire forest dynamics in the southern
   boreal forests of western Quebec using historical aerial photographs
   from the 1930s, alongside with modern aerial photographs from the 1990s.
   We quantify the changes in forest cover classes (i.e., conifers, mixed
   and broadleaved) for 16 study sites that were burned between 1940 and
   1970. We then analyzed how interactions between pre-fire forest
   composition, site characteristics and a fire severity weather index
   (FSWI) affected the probability of changes in forest cover. In the
   1930s, half of the cover of sampled sites were coniferous while the
   other half were broadleaved or mixed. Between the 1930s and the 1990s,
   41\% of the areas maintained their initial cover while 59\% changed. The
   lowest probability of changes was found with initial coniferous cover
   and well drained till deposits. Moreover, an important proportion of
   1930s broadleaved/mixed cover transitioned to conifers in the 1990s,
   which was mainly associated with high FSWI and well-drained deposits.
   Overall, our results highlight a relatively high resistance and
   resilience of southern boreal coniferous forests to fire, which suggest
   that future increase in fire frequency may not necessarily result in a
   drastic loss of conifers.}},

Abstract = {{The reuse and recycling of products, leading to the utilization of
   wastes as key resources in a closed loop, is a great opportunity for the
   market in terms of added value and reduced environmental impact. In this
   context, producing carbonaceous anode materials starting from raw
   materials derived from food waste appears to be a possible approach to
   enhance the overall sustainability of the energy storage value chain,
   including Li-ion (LIBs) and Na-ion batteries (NIBs). In this framework,
   we show the behavior of anodes for LIBs and NIBs prepared with coffee
   ground-derived hard carbon as active material, combined with green
   binders such as Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), alginate (Alg), or
   polyacrylic acid (PAA). In order to evaluate the effect of the various
   binders on the charge/discharge performance, structural and
   electrochemical investigations are carried out. The electrochemical
   characterization reveals that the alginate-based anode, used for NIBs,
   delivers much enhanced charge/discharge performance and capacity
   retention. On the other hand, the use of the CMC-based electrode as LIBs
   anode delivers the best performance in terms of discharge capacity,
   while the PAA-based electrode shows enhanced cycling stability. As a
   result, the utilization of anode materials derived from an abundant food
   waste, in synergy with the use of green binders and formulations,
   appears to be a viable opportunity for the development of efficient and
   sustainable Li-ion and Na-ion batteries.}},

   hierarchical clustering classified the 23 sampling locations into three
   clusters, classifying them as sites of high, low, and moderate

   in 9 parameters (EC, TDS, TSS, PO43-, Na+, Mg, Cd, Pb and OrgN),
   primarily responsible for the discrimination of the clusters. PCA was
   then employed on the normalized dataset for the identification of
   potential pollution sources. PCA yielded two significant principal
   components, describing anthropogenic and natural factors defining the
   water contamination. Finally, PMF was employed on the dataset matrix,
   with four pre-defined factors. Leaching from Boragaon landfill site,
   surface water runoff, discharge of effluents from the industries in the
   wetland and discharge from Basistha River were found to be the major

Abstract = {{Various options for dc grid protection strategies are currently
   investigated which differ in terms of speed and selectivity. In order to
   compare these options fairly, the impact on the connected ac grid needs
   to be studied. This paper analyzes the ac grid impact in terms of
   frequency stability and calculates the reserve capacity necessary to
   retain the stability. Assuming fast frequency reserves as a possible
   mitigation, a probabilistic method is provided to determine a trade-off
   between under frequency load shedding and additional reserve
   requirement. In general, non-selective strategies require higher and
   faster reserves compared to their fully selective counterparts for both
   cases analyzed in this paper. Both the selectivity and the speed of
   protection have an influence on the reserve requirement. The dc grid
   topology also plays an important role in the reserve sizing by
   determining the impact of dc contingencies on the ac grid. The concept
   of reserve sizing based on temporary loss of supply shows value in terms
   of lower capacity requirement. A grid specific CBA study shows that it
   is possible to compensate the higher investment cost associated with dc
   breakers by the benefit of lower reserve procurement cost.}},

   south of the opening of an ice-free corridor in the North American ice
   sheets lends credence to a Pacific coastal migration theory (CMT)
   explaining the route for the initial peopling of the Americas. This
   theory has been informally discussed for more than 50 years, but until
   recently, has been largely ignored and never properly defined as a
   result. We provide a formal definition of the CMT which, briefly stated,
   is that Upper Paleolithic populations moved from Asia to coastal regions
   along the northwestern Pacific Rim between similar to 45-30 ka. By
   similar to 30 ka these coastal populations developed a mixed maritime,
   nearshore, and terrestrial adaptation involving the use of boats, shell
   fishhooks for deep-water fishing, and a stemmed point and macroblade
   core technology. About 25-24 ka a subset of these coastal populations
   became isolated somewhere in the vicinity of the Japan/Paleo-Hokkaido,
   Sahkalin, Kuril (PSHK) region, developing genetically into the ancient
   Native American (ANA) populations that eventually settled the Americas.
   Between similar to 22-16 ka these ANA people began migrating by foot and
   boat along the southern Beringian coast and down the Alaskan and
   Canadian coastline into the Americas south of the continental ice sheets
   before eventually expanding inland. We develop a series of testable
   hypotheses through which the CMT can be examined. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The utilization of tungsten in traffic, smelting, mining, and other
   industrial applications allows its' accumulation in the environmental
   ecosystems. The present study included using a soluble form of tungsten
   (tungstate) at different levels (0, 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 mg L-1) as a
   water contaminant. The germinating seeds experienced tungstate at 1-50
   mg L-1 exhibited stimulation of seedling dry and fresh matter stress
   tolerance indices, whereas retardation of these traits at the level of
   100 mg L-1 was manifested. The stimulation of seedling growth at the
   levels of 1-50 mg L-1 was associated with the regulation of reactive
   oxygen status, higher stability of cell membrane, and elevated level of
   antioxidative responses. Regarding the oxidative stress of the seedlings
   exposed to tungstate contaminated water, only the concentration of 100
   mg L-1 induced accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and
   hydroxyl radical with apparent membrane deteriorations in terms of lipid
   peroxidation. Furthermore, reductions of phytochelatins, reduced
   glutathione, ascorbate, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase, as
   well as glutathione-S-transferase were the main symptoms of tungstate
   phytotoxicity at the same level. The accumulation of lignin, ionic
   peroxidase, soluble peroxidase, and lignin-related enzymes
   (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polyphenol oxidase) were the striking
   reasons for restricting seedlings growth at noxious tungstate level. The
   results could suggest that the elevated levels of defense systems, at
   least in part, were accountable for raising broccoli resistance against
   tungstate stress at low doses. Furthermore, these plants can grow in
   tungsten-polluted areas by modifying their physiological processes.
   However, this study shed the light to the eco-toxicity of tungstate and
   imparts evidence for the need to establishing environmental risk
   management of tungstate accumulation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{During a ship life cycle, one of the most critical phases in terms of
   safety refers to harbor maneuvers, which take place in restricted and
   congested waters, leading to higher collision and grounding risks in
   comparison to open sea navigation. In this scenario, a single accident
   may stop the harbor's traffic as well as incur in patrimonial damage,
   environmental pollution, human casualties, and reputation losses. In
   order to support the vessel's captain during the maneuver, local
   experienced maritime pilots stay on board coordinating the ship
   navigation while in restricted waters. Aiming to assess the main factors
   contributing to human errors in pilot-assisted harbor ship maneuvers,
   this work proposes a Bayesian network model for human reliability
   analysis (HRA), supported by a prospective human performance model for
   quantification. The novelty of this work resides into two aspects: (a)
   incorporation of harbor specific conditions for maritime navigation HRA,
   including the performance of ship's crew and maritime pilots and (b) the
   use of a prospective human performance model as an alternative to
   expert's opinion for quantification purposes. To illustrate the usage of
   the proposed methodology, this paper presents an analysis of the route
   keeping task along waterways, starting from the quantification of human
   error probabilities (HEP) and including the ranking of the main
   performance shaping factors that contribute to the HEP.}},

   Novel Implications}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Solid-liquid dissolution is a central step in many industrial
   applications such as pharmaceutical, process engineering, and pollution
   control. Accurate mathematical models are proposed to improve reactor
   design and process operations. Analytical methods are significantly
   beneficial in the case of iterative methods used within experimental
   investigations. In the present study, a detailed analytical solution for
   the general case of solid particles dissolving in multiphase chemical
   reaction systems is presented. In this model, the authors consider a
   formulation that considers the particles' shape factor. The general case
   presented could be utilized within different problems of multiphase
   flows. These methods could be extended to different cases within the
   chemical engineering area. Examples are illustrated here in relation to
   limestone dissolution taking place within the Wet Flue Gas
   Desulfurization process, where calcium carbonate is dissolving in an
   acidic environment. The method is the most common used technology to
   abate SO2 released by fuel combustion. Limestone dissolution plays a
   major role in the process. Nevertheless, there is a need for
   improvements in the optimization of the WFGD process for scale-up
   purposes. The mathematical model has been tested by comparison with
   experimental data from several mild acidic dissolution assays of
   sedimentary and metamorphic limestone. We have found that R-2 subset of
   0.92 +/- 0.06 from dozens of experiments. This fact verifies the model
   qualifications in capturing the main drivers of the system.}},

Title = {{Impact of protein dynamics on secondary structure prediction}},
Journal = {{BIOCHIMIE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{14-22}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Protein 3D structures support their biological functions. As the number
   of protein structures is negligible in regards to the number of
   available protein sequences, prediction methodologies relying only on
   protein sequences are essential tools. In this field, protein secondary
   structure prediction (PSSPs) is a mature area, and is considered to have
   reached a plateau.
   Nonetheless, proteins are highly dynamical macromolecules, a property
   that could impact the PSSP methods. Indeed, in a previous study, the
   stability of local protein conformations was evaluated demonstrating
   that some regions easily changed to another type of secondary structure.
   The protein sequences of this dataset were used by PSSPs and their
   results compared to molecular dynamics to investigate their potential
   impact on the quality of the secondary structure prediction.
   Interestingly, a direct link is observed between the quality of the
   prediction and the stability of the assignment to the secondary
   structure state. The more stable a local protein conformation is, the
   better the prediction will be. The secondary structure assignment not
   taken from the crystallized structures but from the conformations
   observed during the dynamics slightly increase the quality of the
   secondary structure prediction. These results show that evaluation of
   PSSPs can be done differently, but also that the notion of dynamics can
   be included in development of PSSPs and other approaches such as de novo
   approaches. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et

Abstract = {{Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the
   first coronavirus that has caused a pandemic. Assessing the prevalence
   of anti-SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare worker groups offers a unique
   opportunity to study the correlation between seroconversion and
   immunization because of their occupational exposure and a higher risk of
   contagion. The study enrolled 3242 asymptomatic employees of
   ``Policlinico Riuniti{''}, Foggia. After the first screening, we
   collected sequential serum samples for up to 23 weeks from the same
   subjects. In order to perform a longitudinal follow-up study and get
   information about the titration of IgG levels, we analyzed data from
   subjects (33) with at least two consecutive serological IgG-positive
   tests; 62 (1.9\%; 95\% CI: 1.4-2.3) tested positive for at least one
   anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The seroprevalence was lower in the high-risk
   group 1.4\% (6/428; 95\% CI: 0.5-2.6) vs. the intermediate-risk group
   2.0\% (55/2736; 95\% CI: 1.5-2.5). Overall, within eight weeks, we
   detected a mean reduction of -17\% in IgG levels. Our data suggest a
   reduction of about 9.27 AU/mL every week (R-2 = 0.35, p = 0.0003). This
   study revealed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Foggia's
   hospital healthcare staff (1.9\%). Moreover, the IgG level reduction
   suggests that the serological response fades fast in asymptomatic
   infections.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Delirium is characterized by fluctuating attention or arousal, with high
   prevalence in the orthopaedic ward. Our aim was to: 1) establish the
   prevalence of delirium on an orthopaedic ward, and 2) compare delirium
   prevalence using a single geriatrician assessment vs. multiple 3D-CAM
   (3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for Confusion Assessment Method)
   assessments during the day. We hypothesized that multiple assessments
   would increase the detection rate due to the fluctuating nature of
   delirium.
   Methods
   Comparative study conducted at an academic hospital in Hamilton,
   Ontario. Participants included patients 65 years and older admitted to
   the orthopaedic ward (n=55). After a geriatrician made the first
   assessment of delirium by 3D-CAM on each patient, teams with specialized
   geriatrics training reassessed participants up to four times. Delirium
   rates based on first assessment were compared to cumulative end-of-day
   rates to determine if detection increased with multiple assessments.
   Results
   The prevalence of delirium was 30.9\% (17 participants) using multiple
   assessments. Of these cases, 13 (76.4\%) were detected in the initial
   geriatrician assessment. In patients with hip fractures, 70.6\% (12 of
   17) were identified as delirious by multiple assessments.
   Conclusion
   As symptoms fluctuate, multiple daily CAM assessments may increase the
   identification of delirium in orthopaedic inpatients.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Hyperoxygenation and hyperinflation, preferably with a
   mechanical ventilator, is the most commonly used technique to prevent
   the adverse effects of open endotracheal suctioning on arterial
   oxygenation and pulmonary volume. However, limited data are available on
   the effects of oxygen concentrations < 100\% and PEEP with zero
   end-expiratory pressure (0 PEEP) to improve oxygenation and to maintain
   adequate ventilation during open endotracheal suctioning. The aim of
   this study was to analyze the behavior of S-pO2 and end-tidal CO2
   pressure (P-ETCO2) in open endotracheal suctioning using the 0 PEEP
   technique with baseline F-IO2 (0 PEEP baseline F-IO2) and 0 PEEP +
   hyperoxygenation of 20\% above the baseline value (0 PEEP F-IO2 + 0.20)
   in critically ill subjects receiving mechanical ventilation. METHODS:
   This was a prospective, randomized, single-blind crossover study, for
   which 48 subjects with various clinical and surgical conditions were
   selected; of these, 38 subjects completed the study. The subjects were
   randomized for 2 interventions: 0 PEEP baseline F-IO2 and 0 PEEP F-IO2 +
   0.20 during the open endotracheal suctioning procedure. Oxygenation was
   assessed via oxygen saturation as measured with pulse oximetry (SpO2),
   and changes in lung were monitored via P-ETCO2 using volumetric
   capnography. RESULTS: In the intragroup analysis with 0 PEEP baseline
   F-IO2,F- there was no significant increase after open endotracheal
   suctioning in either S-pO2 (P 5.63) or P-ETCO2 (P 5.11). With 0 PEEP
   F-IO2 + 0.20, there was a significant increase in S-pO2 (P <.001), with
   no significant changes in P-ETCO2 (P 5.55). In the intergroup
   comparisons, there was a significant increase compared to the basal
   values only with the 0 PEEP + 0.20 method at 1 min after
   hyperoxygenation (P <.001), post-immediately (P <.001), at 1 min after
   (P <.001), and at 2 min after open endotracheal suctioning (P <.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The appropriate indication of the hyperinflation strategy
   via mechanical ventilation using 0 PEEP with or without hyperoxygenation
   proved to be efficient to maintain S-pO2 and P-ETCO2 levels. These
   results suggest that the technique can minimize the loss of lung volume
   due to open endotracheal suctioning.}},

Title = {{20 years of the European IVF-monitoring Consortium registry: what have
   we learned? A comparison with registries from two other regions}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{STUDY QUESTION: How has the performance of the European regional
   register of the European IVF-monitoring Consortium (EIM)/European
   Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) evolved from 1997
   to 2016, as compared to the register of the Centres for Disease Control
   and Prevention (CDC) of the USA and the Australia and New Zealand
   Assisted Reproduction Database (ANZARD)?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: It was found that coherent and analogous changes are
   recorded in the three regional registers over time, with a different
   intensity and pace, that new technologies are taken up with considerable
   delay and that incidental complications and adverse events are only
   recorded sporadically.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: European data on ART have been collected since
   1997 by EIM. Data collection on ART in Europe is particularly difficult
   due to its fragmented political and legal landscape. In 1997,
   approximately 78.1\% of all known institutions offering ART services in
   23 European countries submitted data and in 2016 this number rose to
   91.8\% in 40 countries.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We compared the changes in European ART
   data as published in the EIM reports (2001-2020) with those of the USA,
   as published by CDC, and with those of Australia and New Zealand, as
   published by ANZARD.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We performed a retrospective
   analysis of the published EIM data sets spanning the 20 years observance
   period from 1997 to 2016, together with the published data sets of the
   USA as well as of Australia and New Zealand. By comparing the data sets
   in these three large registers, we analysed differences in the
   completeness of the recordings together with differences in the time
   intervals on the occurrence of important trends in each of them. Effects
   of suspected over- and under-reporting were also compared between the
   three registers. X-2 log-rank analysis was used to assess differences in
   the data sets.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: During the period 1997-2016, the
   numbers of recorded ART treatments increased considerably (5.3-fold in
   Europe, 4.6-fold in the USA, 3.0-fold in Australia and New Zealand),
   while the number of registered treatment modalities rose from 3 to 7 in
   Europe, from 4 to 10 in the USA and from 5 to 8 in Australia and New
   Zealand, as published by EIM, CDC and ANZARD, respectively. The uptake
   of new treatment modalities over time has been very different in the
   three registers. There is a considerable degree of underreporting of the
   number of initiated treatment cycles in Europe. The relationship between
   IVF and ICSI and between fresh and thawing cycles evolved similarly in
   the three geographical areas. The freeze-all strategy is increasingly
   being adopted by all areas, but in Europe with much delay. Fewer cycles
   with the transfer of two or more embryos were reported in all three
   geographical areas. The delivery rate per embryo transfer in thawing
   cycles bypassed that in fresh cycles in the USA in 2012, in Australia
   and New Zealand in 2013, but not yet in Europe. As a result of these
   changing approaches, fewer multiple deliveries have been reported. Since
   2012, the most documented adverse event of ART in all three registers
   has been premature birth (<37 weeks). Some adverse events, such as
   maternal death, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, haemorrhage and
   infections, were only recorded by EIM and ANZARD.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The methods of data collection and
   reporting were very different among European countries, but also among
   the three registers. The better the legal background on ART
   surveillance, the more complete are the data sets. Until the legal
   obligation to report is installed in all European countries together
   with an appropriate quality control of the submitted data the reported
   numbers and incidences should be interpreted with caution.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The growing number of reported
   treatments in ART, the higher variability in treatment modalities and
   the rising contribution to the birth rates over the last 20 years point
   towards the increasing impact of ART. High levels of completeness in
   data reporting have been reached, but inconsistencies and inaccuracies
   still remain and need to be identified and quantified. The current trend
   towards a higher diversity in treatment modalities and the rising impact
   of cryostorage, resulting in improved safety during and after ART
   treatment, require changes in the organization of surveillance in ART.
   The present comparison must stimulate all stakeholders in ART to
   optimize surveillance and data quality assurance in ART.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Time series arise in many fields of science such as engineering, economy
   and agriculture to cite a few. In the early 1990's the so called Fuzzy
   Time Series were proposed to handle vague and imprecise knowledge in
   time series data and have since become competitive forecasting models. A
   common limitation of recent fuzzy time series models is their inability
   to handle non-stationary data. Thus, in this paper we introduce a
   Non-Stationary Fuzzy Time Series (NSFTS). In the proposed method, we
   employ Non-Stationary Fuzzy Sets, in which perturbation functions are
   used to adapt the membership function parameters in the knowledge base
   in response to statistical changes in the time series. The flexibility
   of the method by means of computational experiments was tested with
   eight synthetic non-stationary time series data with several kinds of
   concept drifts, four real market indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ SP500 and
   TAIEX), three real FOREX pairs (EUR-USD, EUR-GBP, GBP-USD), and two real
   cryptocoins exchange rates (Bitcoin-USD and Ethereum-USD). As competitor
   models the Time Variant fuzzy time series and the Incremental Ensemble
   were used, these are two of the major approaches for handling
   non-stationary data sets. The proposed method shows resilience to
   concept drift, by adapting parameters of the model, while preserving the
   symbolic structure of the knowledge base. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effects of moderate-term acai and jucara
   juice intake on fasting glucose, lipid profile, and oxidative stress
   biomarkers in healthy subjects.
   Methods: A randomized cross-over study was performed with 30 healthy
   adults. The subjects were assigned to drink 200 mL/day of acai or jucara
   juice for four weeks with a 4-week washout period. Before and after each
   nutritional intervention, blood samples were obtained to evaluate the
   outcomes: fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides,
   high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density
   lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), small, dense LDL-c (sd-LDL-c), total
   antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress
   index (OSI), uric acid, and activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase
   (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).
   Results: After four weeks, acai and jucara juices increased the
   concentrations of HDL-c by 7.7\% and 11.4\%, respectively (P < 0.05). In
   addition, acai juice intake promoted significant increases in TAC
   (66.7\%), CAT (275.1\%), GPx (15.3\%), and a decrease in OSI (55.7\%)
   compared to baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Jucara juice intake
   significantly increased CAT activity (similar to 15.0\%) in relation to
   baseline. No significant intergroup differences were observed for any
   outcomes (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: The results indicated a positive impact of regular
   consumption of acai and jucara juices on the HDL-c levels, as well as on
   the antioxidant enzyme activities, which may contribute to
   cardiovascular health. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for

Abstract = {{We analyze the outcomes of two randomized field experiments to study the
   effect of binge-watching on subscription to video on demand. In both
   cases, we offered access to subscription VoD (SVoD) to a random set of
   households for several weeks and used another random set of households
   as a control group. In both cases, we find that the households that
   binge-watch TV shows are less likely to pay for SVoD after these free
   trials. Our results suggest that binge-watchers deplete the content of
   interest to them very quickly, which reduces their short-term
   willingness to pay for SVoD. We also show that recommendation reminders
   aimed at widening the content preferences of households offset the
   negative effect of binge-watching and lessen the concerns of
   binge-watchers with lack of content refresh. We discuss that these
   recommendation reminders may help content providers manage supply costs,
   which may otherwise become prohibitive with frequent updates to SVoD
   catalogs.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Polymer membranes have been widely used in guided bone regeneration
   (GBR), especially when it comes to their use in dentistry. Poly (lactic
   acid) (PLA) have good mechanical properties such as flexibility, which
   allows the material to be moldable and also has biocompatibility and
   biodegradation. Besides that, bioglass (BG) incorporated into the
   polymer matrix can promote osteoinduction properties and osteoconduction
   properties to the polymer-ceramic biocomposite. The membranes are also
   required to exhibit antimicrobial activity to prevent or control the
   proliferation of pathogenic microorganisms, and the addition of carbon
   nanotubes (CNT) can assist in this property. The porous membranes of PLA
   with the addition of different contents of BG and CNT were obtained by
   solvent casting in controlled humidity method, and the synergistic
   effect of the addition of both fillers were investigated. The membranes
   showed pores (3-11 mu m) on their surface. The addition of 5 wt\% BG
   causes an increase in the surface porosity and bioactivity properties of
   the PLA. The agar diffusion test showed antimicrobial activity in the
   membranes with addition of CNT. In vitro results showed that the porous
   membranes were not cytotoxic and allowed cell activity and
   differentiation. Thus, BG collaborated to increase biological activity
   while CNT contributed to microbial activity, creating a synergistic
   effect on PLA porous membranes, being this effect more evident for
   PLA/5BG/1.0CNT. These results indicated a promising use of this new
   biomaterial for the production of porous membranes for GBR.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the dynamics and their ecological risks for
   aquatic species of lipid regulator, nervous stimulant, anti-inflammatory
   and endocrine disrupters in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB),
   submerged aerated biological filters (SABF) and horizontal subsurface
   flow constructed wetland (HSSF-CW) reactors that treat swine wastewater.
   Four organic loads of swine wastewater (SW) were used according to
   changing the chemical oxygen demand. 13 contaminants were quantified,
   standing out the endocrine disruptors, lipid regulator and
   anti-inflammatory. In phase III, 8318.4 ng L-1 of 4-ocylphenol was found
   at the influent of the UASB reactor and removal from 1877.1 to 13.7 ng
   L-1 in the bisphenol A system. With the maximum organic load, there was
   a reduction among all the treatment units, with concentrations between
   1877.1 and 13.7 ng L-1 of bisphenol A and had naproxen removal of 94.5\%
   and 2,7 ng L-1 after treating phases II and III. It was found that
   24.6\% of the contaminants presented a high ecological risk, with
   maximum values of 27.4 (4-nonylphenol, phase II), 24.6 and 5.9 (17
   beta-estradiol, phase IV and I, respectively), 13.4 (4-ocylphenol, phase
   III) and 4.4 (estrone, phase IV) in the influent system. The reduction
   of ecological risk potentials was optimized by SABF and HSSF-CW. The
   effect oxygen availability and microbiological activities optimized the
   reduction of ecological risks on zebrafish (Danio rerio) and cnidarian
   (Hydra attenuata) species, moreover, the reduction of mass flows and
   ecological risks of the emerging contaminants are associated with the
   use of biological reactors in series and organic stabilizations. (C)

Abstract = {{Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare form of thyroid malignancy
   that can be diagnostically challenging on fine needle aspiration (FNA)
   cytology. Ancillary tests such as elevated serum or immunohistochemical
   positive calcitonin have been helpful, yet they can occasionally provide
   false positive results. In search for an alternative method to improve
   diagnostic accuracy (DA), we applied hyperspectral Raman spectroscopy to
   characterize the biochemical composition of single cells from MTC and
   compared their spectral information to cells from other types of thyroid
   nodules. Hyperspectral Raman images of 117 MTC single cells from
   digested tissue were obtained with a line-scan hyperspectral Raman
   microscope and compared to 127 benign and 121 classic variant of
   papillary thyroid carcinoma (CVPTC) cells. When principal component
   analysis and linear discriminant analysis were used to classify the
   spectral data, MTC cells were differentiated from benign and CVPTC cells
   with 97\% and 99\% DA, respectively. In addition, MTC cells exhibited a
   prominent Raman peak at 1003 cm(-1), whose intensity is 84\% and 226\%
   greater on average than that observed in benign and CVPTC cells,
   respectively. When specifically utilizing only this peak as a spectral
   marker, MTC cells were separated from benign and CVPTC cells with 87\%
   and 95\% DA, respectively. As this peak is linked to phenylalanine,
   which is known to be associated with calcitonin release in thyroid
   parafollicular cells, the increased intensity further suggests that this
   Raman peak could potentially be a new diagnostic marker for MTC.
   Furthermore, preliminary data from MTC cells (n=21) isolated from a
   simulated FNA procedure provided similar Raman signatures when compared
   to single cells from digestion. These results suggest that ``Raman-based
   cytopathology{''} can be used as an adjunct technique to improve the
   diagnostic accuracy of FNA cytopathology at a single cell level. (c)

   groups of images, with 10 in each group: PR and MPR. To check prognostic
   accuracy, 2 images from each group were randomly selected and reinserted
   into the sample, totaling 24 images. A questionnaire was completed by 54
   professionals: 27 orthodontists and 27 oral and maxillofacial surgeons
   (OMFSs). Data were evaluated by using the x2 and McNemar's tests and
   Kappa statistics at P < .05.
   Results. There were no statistically significant differences when
   isolated PR images were compared with MPR images by orthodontists (P =
   .72) or OMFSs (P = .45). However, there were significant differences in
   the professional decision regarding the prognosis for impacted teeth,
   where OMFSs indicated the need for more extractions compared with
   orthodontists (P < .0001).
   Conclusions. There are no differences between PR and multiplanar CBCT
   images with regard to the determination of the prognosis for impacted
   mandibular third molars. However, there was a difference in the decision
   making between the different specialties.}},

Abstract = {{The aim was to investigate the effect of cryopreservation on the enamel
   bonding properties of orthodontic brackets. Sixty-six human premolars
   were randomly allocated to a control group or a cryopreserved group.
   Conventional stainless-steel orthodontic brackets were bonded with a
   light cure adhesive on the buccal side of the premolars. The shear bond
   strength (SBS) was determined at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The SBS
   and adhesive remnant index (ARI) were evaluated respectively by an
   independent samples t test and Fisher's exact test (alpha<0.05). The
   mean failure load was lower in the cryopreserved group. However, this
   difference in SBS was not significant (p=0.443). In both groups, the ARI
   mostly indicated a failure at the enamel-adhesive interface. The mean
   ARI scores for both groups were not significantly different (p=0.099).
   Within the limitations of this macro bond strength testing, it can be
   concluded that cryopreservation does not significantly affect the
   bonding properties of enamel.}},

Abstract = {{Each of Heinrich Biber's Mystery Sonatas features a distinct violin
   tuning. How do these scordatura relate to standard tuning? How might
   they affect the sonatas' musical organization and players' experience?
   Transformational voice-leading theory helps to reveal overlapping
   categories here. Quintal scordatura include adjacent-string fifths,
   creating zones where notated and sounding intervals match. Chordal
   scordatura, in which the strings realize a triad, involve more
   displacement. Psychological research on altered pitch feedback suggests
   that scordatura are most unsettling for players when they preserve
   aspects of standard tuning. Analyzing scordatura, then, shows how
   instruments function as spaces for musical action.}},

Abstract = {{The Spanish economy has a very problematic labor market characterized by
   high and persistent levels of unemployment, elevated long-term
   unemployment, strong segmentation and low regional mobility, among other
   drawbacks. This paper uses labor matching data from a large database of
   administrative microdata (Continuous Sample of Working Lives, MCVL) and
   structures them into a contingency table which cross-classifies the
   information of workers and jobs at provincial and occupational levels.
   The association analysis performed allows us to identify a more precise
   vision of the structure of the labor market, and a better design
   regarding active labor market policies. Our results demonstrate, for
   example, that highly isolated markets and those that influence the
   entire national territory coexist in the Spanish labor market. Finally,
   we also propose a new smoothing method in order to deal with typical
   statistical problems in sparse contingency tables, such as the existence
   of non-structural zero frequencies or sparsity.}},

Abstract = {{For much of the European integration process, local authorities have
   been on the legal margins. Yet many amongst this group, and cities in
   particular, consider themselves as important players in realising the
   Union's overarching policy objectives. This view is slowly but surely
   finding traction with the EU's political institutions. This article
   suggests that the future architecture of the European Union's (EU's)
   operating system will evince a rapprochement between the socio-economic
   clout of local authorities, notably cities, and their legal-political
   recognition at Union level. It further suggests that there is room for
   greater conceptual clarity along two lines when interrogating the future
   of the vertical axis of the Union's governance structure. First, the
   local tier should be disaggregated, with cities treated as a distinct
   subset of the category of subnational authorities that warrant attention
   in their own right. Second, the relationship between the EU and cities
   should be dissected further to develop a more fine-grained map of the
   possible ways in which both levels interact and the norms and incentives
   that shape those interactions. To this end, a six-fold taxonomy is
   developed that covers cities in their guise as (i) implementation
   agents; (ii) value communities; (iii) front-line decision-makers; (iv)
   democracy enhancers; (v) policy developers; and (vi) advocates of urban
   interests in EU decision-making. Finally, this article addresses the
   methodological implications of an urban turn in European legal
   scholarship.}},

Title = {{The novel zebrafish model pretzel demonstrates a central role for

   Haar syndrome}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Frank-Ter Haar syndrome (FTHS, MIM \#249420) is a rare skeletal
   dysplasia within the defective collagen remodelling spectrum (DECORS),
   which is characterised by craniofacial abnormalities, skeletal
   malformations and fibrotic soft tissues changes including dermal
   fibrosis and joint contractures. FTHS is caused by homozygous or
   compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutation or deletion of SH3PXD2B
   (Src homology 3 and Phox homology domain-containing protein 2B; MIM
   \#613293). SH3PXD2B encodes an adaptor protein with the same name, which
   is required for full functionality of podosomes, specialised membrane
   structures involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. The
   pathogenesis of DECORS is still incompletely understood and, as a
   result, therapeutic options are limited. We previously generated an
   mmp14a/b knockout zebrafish and demonstrated that it primarily mimics
   the DECORS-related bone abnormalities. Here, we present a novel sh3pxd2b
   mutant zebrafish, pretzel, which primarily reflects the DECORS-related
   dermal fibrosis and contractures. In addition to relatively mild
   skeletal abnormalities, pretzel mutants develop dermal and
   musculoskeletal fibrosis, contraction of which seems to underlie
   grotesque deformations that include kyphoscoliosis, abdominal
   constriction and lateral folding. The discrepancy in phenotypes between
   mmp14a/b and sh3pxd2b mutants suggests that in fish, as opposed to
   humans, there are differences in spatiotemporal dependence of ECM
   remodelling on either sh3pxd2b or mmp14a/b. The pretzel model presented
   here can be used to further delineate the underlying mechanismof the
   fibrosis observed in DECORS, as well as screening and subsequent
   development of novel drugs targeting DECORS-related fibrosis.

Abstract = {{Background: In HIV-infected patients, the immunogenicity of hepatitis B
   vaccines is impaired. In this randomised controlled study (RCT), we
   investigated the effect of Fendrix (R) versus double-dose Engerix (R)
   vaccination in previously non-responsive HIV-infected subjects.
   Methods: Patients included those who were HIV-infected and
   non-responders to a primary (single-dose hepatitis B (HBV) vaccination)
   and a subsequent double-dose HBV revaccination schedule. Subjects were
   randomised m to receive Fendrix (R) (t = 0, 4, 8, 24 weeks) or
   double-dose Engerix (R) (t = 0, 4, 24 weeks) vaccinations. Primary
   efficacy, defined as anti-HBs response >= 10 IU/l, was evaluated at week
   28 in both study arms.
   Results: A subset of 48 patients non-responsive to HBV vaccination was
   selected, from a cohort of patients at our institution, who underwent
   HBV vaccination unsuccessfully either in a previous RCT or through
   standard care. The anti-HBs >= 10 IU/l response rate at week 28 in the
   Fendrix (R) arm and the Engerix (R) arm were 85.7\% and 65.0\%,
   respectively (p = 0.09). There was no significant difference between the
   two used vaccine types in the anti-HBs levels reached. In our
   institution, the overall response rate after initial standard-dose
   vaccination schedule and double-dose revaccination in our cohort was
   75\%. In this study, combining the effects of Fendrix and Engerix
   resulted in a 75\% response rate in the 25\% remaining non-responders on
   initial and double-dose revaccination series. This yielded an absolute
   19\% increase and an overall response to HBV vaccination in HIV-infected
   patients of around 94\% in our cohort.
   Conclusion: These results together, suggest that continuing HBV
   vaccination in non-responders to a first course of single-dose vaccine
   and a double-dose revaccination scheme is worth the effort. No
   superiority of one of the investigated hepatitis B vaccines was shown in
   this cohort but an appropriate number of patients needed to achieve
   reliable answers was not achieved.}},

Abstract = {{To support the types of learning outcomes that management students need
   in today's organizations, business schools increasingly call for faculty
   to engage in experiential pedagogy. However, teaching practices that are
   consistent with experiential pedagogy deliberately engage students'
   emotions and may breach expected teaching norms. We discuss what we
   believe are the unaddressed moral responsibilities of business schools
   that advocate for and embed experiential pedagogy in their programs. We
   frame business schools' experiential pedagogy advocacy as an explicit
   moral duty (Hosmer, 1995), arguing that a dilemma exists in encouraging
   experiential-teaching approaches without knowing how faculty use them
   and what student safeguards are in place. Drawing on Nicolini's (2012)
   practice theory, we describe experiential pedagogy as teaching
   practices, structures, and rules that would benefit from community-based
   standards. We conclude with recommendations for crafting an
   experiential-teaching community of practice, delineating important
   research questions by which to develop this community.}},

Abstract = {{Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is defined as the presence of one or more
   extra ``X{''} chromosome in a male patient. It affects approximately 1
   in 600 newborn males and the most common chromosomal abnormality,
   leading to male hypogonadism and infertility. There is a lack of data
   supporting best practices for KS patients' care. In this paper we review
   controversial issues in KS research ranging from mechanisms of variation
   in KS phenotype to abnormalities resulting in reduced sperm production
   to successful sperm retrieval disparities after testicular sperm
   extraction (TESE). Translation to live birth and offspring health is
   also examined. Finally, medical therapies used to optimize the hormonal
   status and chances of fertility in KS patients are reviewed. We will
   also discuss the experimental spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) treatments,
   which are considered the future for TESE negative patients. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{On account of industrialization and increasing population, the water
   bodies get polluted by means of degradable and non-degradable
   substances. In 21st century, it is necessary to maintain a healthy

   the issues related to water quality could be resolved by using
   nanoparticles and nano-filtration membrane methods from the development
   of nanotechnology. In this research, attempt to remove heavy metals from
   Chithrapuzha River water at Cochin bar mouth (S-1) and Fact barge jetty
   (S-2) using Fe2O3 prepared via green synthesis using Egg albumin and
   Aloe vera. Our results provoke that, the synthesis of Fe2O3 nanoparticle
   is costeffective and eco-friendly and also good in nano-regime. Results
   of filtration studies showed that Fe2O3 nanoparticles remove heavy
   metals from Chithrapuzha River water and also increases the DO content

Abstract = {{In this study, an atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier
   discharge-based argon plasma jet has been modeled using COMSOL
   Multiphysics, which is based on the finite element method. The fluid
   dynamics and plasma modules of COMSOL Multiphysics code have been used
   for the modeling of the plasma jet. The plasma parameters, such as
   electron density, electron temperature, and electrical potential, have
   been examined by varying the electrical parameters, that is, supply
   voltage and supply frequency for both cases of static and with the flow
   of argon gas. The argon gas flow rate was fixed at 1 l/min. Ring
   electrode arrangement is subjected to a range of supply frequencies
   (10-25 kHz) and supply voltages (3.5-6 kV). The experimental results of
   the ring electrode configuration have been compared with the simulation
   analysis results. These results help in establishing an optimized
   operating range of the dielectric barrier discharge-based cold plasma
   jet in the glow discharge regime without arcing phenomenon. For the
   applied voltage and supply frequency parameters examined in this work,
   the discharge was found to be consistently homogeneous and displayed the

Abstract = {{Prediction of the diseases are possible using medical diagnosis system.
   This type of health care model can be developed using soft computing

   algorithm increases data classification accuracy. This research proposed
   applications of Moth Flame optimization (MFO) and Fuzzy MM Max Neural
   Network (FMMNN) for the development of medical data classification
   system. Here MFO algorithm considers bulk of features from the disease
   dataset and produces optimized set of features based on fitness
   function. MFO is able to avoid local minima problem and this is the main
   cause behind production of optimal set of features. Optimized features
   are then passed to FMMNN for classification of malignant and benign
   cases. As classification is concerned, model experiment achieved 97.74\%
   accuracy for Liver Disorders and 86.95 \% accuracy for Pima Indian
   Diabetes dataset. Improving the medical data classification accuracy is
   directly related to attain good human health.}},

Abstract = {{This article explored the adsorption of the cationic malachite green

   surface measurements of Brunauer Emmett-Teller (BET) and by Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (IFTR).The results collected on the
   kinetics adsorption of malachite green show that the adsorption followed
   a pseudo-second order kinetics.The percentage of elimination reaches
   respectively 86.13\% and 94\% for MG (C=6.10(-4)mol/L) and phenol
   (C=5.10(-4)mol/L).The experimental isotherms were analyzed with Langmuir
   and Freundlich using nonlinear regression. The results showed
   respectively that the isotherms of Freundlich and Langmuir best fitted
   to the equilibrium data for MG and phenol. The thermodynamic study has
   shown that the adsorption of MG and phenol on alpha-Fe2O3 is endothermic
   (Delta H degrees> 0); it increases with temperature. Negative Delta G
   degrees values have shown that the adsorption of MG and phenol on
   alpha-Fe(2)O(3)is spontaneous. However, the positive values of Delta S
   degrees indicate the increase in the disorder of the interface of the
   alpha-Fe(2)O(3)solution during the fixation of MG and phenol.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program utilizes data across
   the ToxCast/Tox21 high-throughput screening (HTS) programs to evaluate
   the biological effects of potential endocrine active substances. A
   potential limitation to the use of in vitro assay data in regulatory
   decision-making is the lack of coverage for xenobiotic metabolic
   processes. Both hepatic- and peripheral-tissue metabolism can yield
   metabolites that exhibit greater activity than the parent compound
   (bioactivation) or are inactive (bioinactivation) for a given biological
   target. Interpretation of biological effect data for both putative
   endocrine active substances, as well as other chemicals, screened in HTS
   assays may benefit from the addition of xenobiotic metabolic
   capabilities to decrease the uncertainty in predicting potential hazards
   to human health. The objective of this study was to develop an approach
   to retrofit existing HTS assays with hepatic metabolism. The Alginate
   Immobilization of Metabolic Enzymes (AIME) platform encapsulates hepatic
   S9 fractions in alginate microspheres attached to 96-well peg lids.
   Functional characterization across a panel of reference substrates for
   phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes revealed substrate depletion with
   expected metabolite accumulation. Performance of the AIME method in the
   VM7Luc estrogen receptor transactivation assay was evaluated across 15
   reference chemicals and 48 test chemicals that yield metabolites
   previously identified as estrogen receptor active or inactive. The
   results demonstrate the utility of applying the AIME method for
   identification of false-positive and false-negative target assay
   effects, reprioritization of hazard based on metabolism-dependent
   bioactivity, and enhanced in vivo concordance with the rodent
   uterotrophic bioassay. Integration of the AIME metabolism method may
   prove useful for future biochemical and cell-based HTS applications.}},

   orientation estimation}},
Journal = {{VISION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{177}},
Pages = {{20-31}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Following exposure to an oriented stimulus, the perceived orientation is
   slightly shifted, a phenomenon termed the tilt aftereffect (TAE). This
   estimation bias, as well as other context-dependent biases, is
   speculated to reflect statistical mechanisms of inference that optimize
   visual processing. Importantly, although measured biases are extremely
   robust in the population, the magnitude of individual bias can be
   extremely variable. For example, measuring different individuals may
   result in TAE magnitudes that differ by a factor of 5. Such findings
   appear to challenge the accounts of bias in terms of learned statistics:
   is inference so different across individuals? Here, we found that a
   strong correlation exists between reaction time and TAE, with slower
   individuals having much less TAE. In the tilt illusion, the spatial
   analogue of the TAE, we found a similar, though weaker, correlation.
   These findings can be explained by a theory predicting that bias, caused
   by a change in the initial conditions of evidence accumulation (e.g.,
   priors), decreases with decision time ({*}Communications Biology 3
   (2020) 1-12). We contend that the context-dependence of visual
   processing is more homogeneous in the population than was previously
   thought, with the measured variability of perceptual bias explained, at
   least in part, by the flexibility of decision-making. Homogeneity in
   processing might reflect the similarity of the learned statistics.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas chronic stress has immunosuppressive effects, the more immediate
   immunologic consequences of acute stressors are less known. We
   postulated that, as part of their `fight or flight' response, rainbow
   trout would rapidly increase the efficacy of their natural immune system
   by means of increased concentrations of crucial plasma proteins. Plasma
   samples were taken from resting fish and from fish 5, 10 or 20 min after
   initiation of a stressful regime. Using crossed immunoelectrophoresis,
   we documented increases in concentrations of complement C3 and 3 other
   proteins within 5 min of initiation of stress. The concentration of C3
   nearly doubled within 10 min of initiation of stress and had returned to
   near resting level by 20 min. This rapid kinetics preclude dependence on
   gene activation, the basis of the acute phase response. Potentiation of
   natural immunity, which can reasonably be expected to be selectively
   advantageous during or immediately after acute stressors may be one
   result of this increase.}},

Title = {{Epigraphic spolia from the Zvonimirova street in Solin}},
Journal = {{TUSCULUM-CASOPIS ZA SOLINSKE TEME}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-62}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The article describes eighteen epigraphic spolia that were found in 1992
   in the town of Solin (Salona) during rescue archaeological excavations.
   These are funerary inscriptions and one votive inscription that were
   built into the eastern part of the Salonitan ramparts during the ancient
   period. According to the textual, linguistic, stylistic, onomastic and
   social analyses of the monuments, most of the inscriptions can be dated
   to the period after AD 170, i.e. the period when the city walls had been
   erected. The inscriptions mention nineteen persons who, belonged to the
   category of ordinary citizens and slaves, but there was indirectly
   concluded that there were several freedmen among the mentioned persons.
   Despite the relatively high number of inscriptions found so far in
   Dalmatia, and consequently a large number of known names, the Dalmatian
   onomastic corpus is supplemented every year with new names, therefore
   five new ones can be added from this group: two gentilicia (Aberius,
   Ammia) and three cognomina (Aiate, Callistianus, Thisbe), not including
   the cognomen Censorina which occurs for the first time in the female
   form. As for the tombstones, the relationship between the deceased and
   the commemorator is as follows: three monuments were erected for the
   children by their parents, two monuments were erected for the spouses,
   one or two monuments were erected by the slaves, one monument was
   erected by the son to the father, one monument perhaps the master raises
   for a slave, and on one monument the relationship between the deceased
   and the commemorator cannot be established due to damage.
   The inscription dedicated to the god Priapus (cat. nr. 1) would be the
   most important inscription from this group, since we are informed from
   it about the existence and expansion of the sanctuary dedicated to this
   god. On one inscription (cat. nr. 7) the word vitricus (stepfather) was
   recorded for the first time in Dalmatia, which enriches the epigraphic
   lexicon of this province. Other monuments complement not only the
   population and onomastic picture but also the grade of literacy in
   Salona. Also, speaking of the context in which these monuments were
   found, the embedded tombstones confirm the practice of spoliation,
   carried out on several occasions during the ancient and late antique
   periods, which is best recorded in Salona in the survey of the city
   walls. Considering the current condition of the collected Salonitan
   monuments, it can be said that the city walls are also the largest
   epigraphic resource of Salona, because for their construction and
   restoration over the centuries it was necessary to use all available
   stone material. In this material were found monuments of various
   characters, from decorative and architectonic pieces, parts of
   sculptures to various types of inscriptions that were built not only
   from the outer faces of the ramparts, but also in their filling. New
   research into the city walls, which can be counted on for many more
   years to come, will no doubt yield a greater number of monuments which
   will continue the reconstruction of life and the population picture in
   the Roman Salona and Dalmatia.}},

   tightness lasting for three days. The ECG suggesting inferior submural
   ischaemia and echocardiographic assessment was normal. Laboratory tests
   showed troponin T levels increased. Coronary angiography was normal.
   CMRI showed patchy contrast uptake. It looked more like viral
   myocarditis.
   Conclusion: Acute myocarditis diagnosis is most difficulty and
   predictively in connection with the variety of clinical presentations.
   The differential diagnosis between myocarditis and AMI can be
   troublesome in ED.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the potential of different vigour tests to reveal
   differences in performance of nine hybrid petunia seed lots. Saturated
   salt accelerated ageing test (SSAA) and 48-hour radicle emergence
   (RE48h) tests were able to predict seedling emergence and longevity
   potential. The results of accelerated ageing (AA) (at 41/43 degrees C,
   48/72 hours, 100\% RH), saturated salt accelerated ageing (SSAA) (at
   41/43/45 degrees C, 72 hours, 75\% RH), mean germination time (MGT),
   48-hour radicle emergence (RE48h) and electrical conductivity (EC) tests
   were compared with seedling emergence in modules and longevity (at 5
   degrees C for 24 months and 25 degrees C for 12 months). Initial
   standard germination (SG) percentages were above 83\% in the lots.
   Seedling emergence ranged between 18 and 89\%, germination after storage
   was between 16 and 88\% at 5 degrees C, and 13 and 96\% at 25 degrees C.
   The SSAA test at 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C for 72 hours was
   correlated with both seedling emergence and longevity. RE48h was
   correlated with emergence and germination after storage at 5 degrees C
   for 24 months; MGT and SG was correlated with seedling emergence.
   Neither AA nor the EC test was correlated with emergence and longevity.
   Thus vigour, expressed as both emergence and storage potential, was
   successfully predicted by the SSAA test and RE48h.}},

Abstract = {{Gene editing of the erythroid-specific BCL11A enhancer in hematopoietic
   stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with sickle cell disease
   (SCD) induces fetal hemoglobin (HbF) without detectable toxicity, as
   assessed by mouse xenotransplant. Here, we evaluated autologous
   engraftment and HbF induction potential of erythroid-specific BCL11A
   enhancer-edited HSPCs in 4 nonhuman primates. We used a single guide RNA
   (sgRNA) with identical human and rhesus target sequences to disrupt a
   GATA1 binding site at the BCL11A +58 erythroid enhancer. Cas9 protein
   and sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) was electroporated into rhesus
   HSPCs, followed by autologous infusion after myeloablation. We found
   that gene edits persisted in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM)
   for up to 101 weeks similarly for BCL11A enhancer- or control
   locus-targeted (AAV.51-targeted) cells. Biallelic BCL11A enhancer
   editing resulted in robust gamma-globin induction, with the highest
   levels observed during stress erythropoiesis. Indels were evenly
   distributed across PB and BM lineages. Off-target edits were not
   observed. Nonhomologous end-joining repair alleles were enriched in
   engrafting HSCs. In summary, we found that edited HSCs can persist for
   at least 101 weeks after transplant and biallelic-edited HSCs provide
   substantial HbF levels in PB red blood cells, together supporting
   further clinical translation of this approach.}},

Abstract = {{Biocompatible nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion-based hydrogels were
   formulated for the encapsulation and delivery of vitamin D-3 and
   curcumin. The aforementioned systems were structurally studied applying
   dynamic light scattering (DLS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
   spectroscopy and viscometry. In vitro studies were conducted using Franz
   diffusion cells to investigate the release of the bioactive compounds
   from the nanocarriers. The cytotoxicity of the nanoemulsions was
   investigated using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell
   proliferation assay and RPMI 2650 nasal epithelial cells as in vitro
   model. DLS measurements showed that vitamin D-3 and curcumin addition in
   the dispersed phase of the nanoemulsions caused an increase in the size
   of the oil droplets from 78.6 +/- 0.2 nm to 83.6 +/- 0.3 nm and from
   78.6 +/- 0.2 nm to 165.6 +/- 1.0 nm, respectively. Loaded nanoemulsions,
   in both cases, were stable for 60 days of storage at 25 degrees C. EPR
   spectroscopy revealed participation of vitamin D-3 and curcumin in the
   surfactants monolayer. In vitro release rates of both lipophilic
   compounds from the nanoemulsions were comparable to the corresponding
   ones from the nanoemulsion-based hydrogels. The developed o/w
   nanoemulsions did not exhibit cytotoxic effect up to the concentration
   threshold of 1 mg/mL in the cell culture medium.}},

Abstract = {{Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is an important molecule that has been
   extensively researched, mainly due to its structure and function.
   Herein, we investigated the electronic behavior of the DNA molecule
   containing 1008 atoms using density functional theory. The bond-charge
   (BC) model shows the relationship between charge density and atomic
   strain. Besides, the model mentioned above is combined with the
   bond-order-length-strength (BOLS) notion to calculate the atomic
   cohesive energy, the bond energy, and the local bond strain of the DNA
   chain. Using the BOLS-BC model, we were able to obtain information on
   the bonding features of the DNA chain and better comprehend the
   associated properties of electrons in biological systems. Consequently,
   this report functions as a theoretical reference for the precise
   regulation of the electrons and the bonding states of biological
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{With the separation of design and manufacture in semiconductor industry,
   self-designed circuits are exposed to hardware Trojan attacks when they
   are outsourced to an untrustworthy foundry. Trojans activated by digital
   logic have gained extensive attention. However, those with analog
   trigger component remain as a serious issue such as the A2 Trojan.
   Existing defense against A2 Trojans mainly relies on runtime detection
   mechanism which needs large monitor hardware overhead and complicated
   identification/handling software. To address these limitations, this
   article proposes a built-in structure to accelerate the activation of A2
   Trojans, which consists of several composite-logic ring oscillators and
   a multiple-purpose controller. In addition, two post-fabrication
   detection schemes named time-division mode-switching (TDMS) and
   scan-based fault test compatible (SFTC) are proposed. TDMS detection
   scheme can discover A2 Trojans when running functional patterns by
   inserting oscillating operations every other cycle. SFTC detection
   scheme can detect A2 Trojans during scan-based fault test by introducing
   oscillation before each capture operation. Evaluations across a wide
   range of A2 Trojans and benchmarks show that our proposal is more
   power-efficient and area-saving compared with existing monitor
   structure.}},

Title = {{Enhanced photocatalytic reduction of aqueous Re(VII) in ambient air by
   amorphous TiO2/g-C3N4 photocatalysts: Implications for Tc(VII)
   elimination}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Although effective photocatalytic removal for aqueous ReO4- (as a
   chemical analogue of TcO4-) have been established, photocatalysts are
   not satisfactory for further applications in term of low light
   harvesting efficiency and fast re-dissolution of ReO2 center dot nH(2)O.
   Herein, the amorphous TiO2/g-C3N4 composites are fabricated by a simple
   hydrolysis approach, producing the amorphous TiO2/30 wt\% g-C3N4 (TCN-3)
   composite with larger specific surface area (similar to 456 m(2) g(-1)),
   narrow band gap (similar to 2.67 eV) and excellent light-capturing
   ability when compared with commercial P25. Lower recombination
   efficiency of photo-generated electron-hole based on the Z-scheme
   mechanism between amorphous TiO2 and g-C3N4 was demonstrated by electron
   paramagnetic resonance and photoelectrochemical analysis. In addition,
   the as-synthesized TCN-3 exhibits an excellent photocatalytic reduction
   of Re(VII) in ambient air with the highest removal percentage of similar
   to 90\% as compared with crystalline TiO2/g-C3N4, and can be regenerated
   even after eight recycles. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that
   the extremely slow re-dissolution of Re(IV) resulted from both
   shortening of ReO2 center dot nH(2)O chains (decrease in coordination
   number of Re-Re) and association of Re(IV) with amorphous TiO2 in TCN-3
   (formation of Re-Ti bond). The overall results further facilitate the
   photocatalytic reduction and elimination for rhenium/technetium, and
   open the wide-range applications for photocatalysis in the disposal of
   some radioactive elements.}},

Title = {{Vascularity and Thickness Changes in Immature Hypertrophic Scars Treated
   With a Pulsed Dye Laser}},
Journal = {{LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives Growth of capillaries is an essential process
   after a dermal injury. An immature scar with robust growth of
   capillaries tends to be hypertrophic. Pulsed dye laser (PDL) causes
   damage to microvascular structures and is increasingly used for early
   erythematous scars to limit scar growth. To have a better understanding
   of the impact of PDL on scar vascularity and to optimize the clinical
   use of PDL for managing hypertrophic scars, this study aimed to explore
   changes in scar erythema, blood perfusion, and thickness of immature
   hypertrophic scars in Asian patients who received PDL treatments at an
   early stage.
   Study Design/Materials and Methods This was a 3-month, assessor-blinded,
   clinical study. There were two groups of patients, the PDL group and the
   control group, who had hypertrophic scars less than 1-year post-injury.
   Patients in the PDL group received three PDL sessions at 4-week
   intervals. A total of three assessments were performed, at baseline, 1
   and 3 months, consisting of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment
   Scale (POSAS) and objective measurements of scar erythema, blood
   perfusion, and scar thickness.
   Results A total of 45 patients were enrolled, 22 in the PDL group and 23
   in the control group. After the 3-month treatment, parameters of scar
   vascularity (P = 0.003), pigmentation (P = 0.026), color (P < 0.001),
   thickness (P < 0.05), and overall scores (P < 0.01) on the POSAS
   significantly decreased in the PDL group. Moreover, objective
   measurements of scar erythema and blood perfusion showed significant
   improvements in the PDL group (P = 0.009 and P = 0.022, respectively)
   but not in the control group (P = 0.296 and P = 0.115, respectively). A
   stable scar thickness was maintained in the PDL group from baseline to 3
   months (0.21 cm vs. 0.22 cm, P > 0.05), whereas scar thickness
   significantly increased in the control group (0.22 cm vs. 0.32 cm, P <
   0.01).
   Conclusion Use of PDL at an early stage controls vascularity of immature
   hypertrophic scar by improving its poor blood perfusion that further
   limits scar thickness growth and promotes scar maturation. Lasers Surg.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE}},

Abstract = {{Thermal management systems of power batteries have attracted a great
   deal of attention because of thermal safety and thermal runaway
   problems. The heat generation measurement is significant in researching
   and designing the thermal management systems. Therefore, effective
   method of measuring total heat generation experimentally is put forward,
   which insulated cotton is used as heat preservation layer for
   temperature rise measurement. The results show that insulated cotton can
   effectively reduce the heat dissipation. Compared with the absence of
   insulated cotton, the temperature rise (Delta t(cot)) of battery with
   insulated cotton is increased by 80.2\%, 70.2\% and 56.0\% at 1 C, 2 C
   and 3 C, respectively. Furtherly, the heat dissipation during the
   discharge process has been evaluated by the temperature drop (Delta tau)
   under the shelving condition following the Newton's cooling formula.
   Towards to the amendment of the battery temperature rise (Delta t(cot))
   measurement, the temperature rise of the high and low temperature
   chamber should be set to (Delta t(cot) + Delta tau) while the battery
   had discharged in it. In this way, more accurate measurement of the
   battery temperature rise (Delta t(total)) is obtained. Compared with the
   theoretical heat generation calculated by energy conservation law and
   energy conversion method, it reveals that battery temperature rise
   (Delta t(total)) can accurately calculate the heat generation of the
   battery.}},

   (NLT). High density of activated HSC in the PNLT was positively
   associated with the number of tumor liver metastases (P=0.036), maximum
   diameter of liver metastases (P=0.002), and recurrence following
   synchronous radical resection (P=0.003). High density of activated HSCs
   in the PNLT was identified as a significant and independent prognostic
   factor for disease-free survival (HR, 2.083; 95\% CI, 1.504-2.885;
   P=0.016) and overall survival (HR, 2.039; 95\% CI, 1.312-3.169;
   P=0.019). Functionally, in vitro assays revealed that activated HSCs
   facilitated colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRA) cells to colonize the liver.
   Molecularly, it was demonstrated that the pro-recurrence of activated
   HSCs depended on paracrine hepatic growth factor. Taken together, the
   present results showed that high density of activated HSCs in the PNLT
   was an independent predictor for CRALM recurrence following resection,
   and they exerted their roles via their effect on CRA cell recruitment
   and proliferation by paracrine HGF.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal influenza is an acute viral infection caused by influenza
   virus, which is often prevalent in the summer and winter. The influenza
   virus can infect pigs and poultry. Some literature reports that the
   influenza virus has an outbreak in summer. The summer climate is
   characterized by a high humidity and high temperature environment, which
   is the same as many animal feeding and growing environments. We
   established a flu animal model under a high temperature and humidity
   environment during the day to observe the impact of high humidity and
   high temperature environment on the mice after contracting the influenza
   virus. Our results indicate that the intestinal flora of 16 s rDNA
   cultured in High humidity and high temperature environment changes, the
   intestinal mucosal permeability increases, the expression of pIgR, sIgA,
   and IgA in the intestinal mucosal immune system decreases, and the NLR
   immune recognition signaling pathway NOD1 is activated. The expression
   of related genes such as NOD2, NF-kappa B, and pIgR increases, which
   leads to the increase of related inflammatory factors in the vicinity of
   the intestines, aggravating local inflammation. High humidity and high
   temperature environment can cause the expression of inflammatory
   cytokines in the body to rise, causing Th17/Treg immune imbalance,
   inhibiting Treg maturation and differentiation, and increasing the
   expression of IL-2, IL-6, and other cytokines, while the expression of
   IFN-gamma and IL-17A decreases. This condition worsens after infection
   with the influenza virus. Overall, our study found that High humidity
   and high temperature environment affect the intestinal flora and the
   body's immune status, thereby aggravating the status of influenza virus
   infection.}},

Title = {{Image Stitching Based on Nonrigid Warping for Urban Scene}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Image stitching based on a global alignment model is widely used in
   computer vision. However, the resulting stitched image may look blurry
   or ghosted due to parallax. To solve this problem, we propose a
   parallax-tolerant image stitching method based on nonrigid warping in
   this paper. Given a group of putative feature correspondences between
   overlapping images, we first use a semiparametric function fitting,
   which introduces a motion coherence constraint to remove outliers. Then,
   the input images are warped according to a nonrigid warp model based on
   Gaussian radial basis functions. The nonrigid warping is a kind of
   elastic deformation that is flexible and smooth enough to eliminate
   moderate parallax errors. This leads to high-precision alignment in the
   overlapped region. For the nonoverlapping region, we use a rigid
   similarity model to reduce distortion. Through effective transition, the
   nonrigid warping of the overlapped region and the rigid warping of the
   nonoverlapping region can be used jointly. Our method can obtain more
   accurate local alignment while maintaining the overall shape of the
   image. Experimental results on several challenging data sets for urban
   scene show that the proposed approach is better than state-of-the-art
   approaches in both qualitative and quantitative indicators.}},

Abstract = {{Rain-flood utilization refers to transforming some amount of rain or
   floodwater into ordinary water resources without decreasing flood
   control standards or damaging the ecological environment of rivers,
   which has gained widespread attention as it can alleviate water
   shortages and gain benefits. This paper put forward the evaluation
   method of rain-flood utilization availability at the distributed
   watershed scale. Based on the water node, some indices of rain-flood
   utilization availability were defined. Then the evaluation method and
   calculation process were unified. Finally, the status and potential of
   the rain-flood utilization of Hanjiang River Basin were analyzed. The
   results indicated that the rain-flood resource in the whole basin is
   48.9 billion m(3), the outflow is 29.9 billion m(3), and the actual
   utilization is about 19.0 billion m(3). The current available rain-flood
   amount and rain-flood utilization potential are 27.7 billion m(3) and
   11.0 billion m(3), and the rain-flood utilization rate is 49.4\%.
   Limited by regulation ability and the rain-flood resources, current
   rain-flood utilization has a clear threshold range. The potential
   utilization objects are mainly for a rainfall process of about two to
   ten years return period. The application in Hanjiang River Basin offers
   some practical information for assessing rain-flood utilization
   scientifically, and the premise for effectively guiding and formulating
   adaptive countermeasures for water resources management.}},

   powder during spark plasma sintering}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS \& HARD MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{93}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The influence of particle size on the densification kinetics of tungsten
   powder during spark plasma sintering was investigated. The densification
   rate of tungsten powder in the intermediate sintering stage decrease
   with in-creasing particle size, resulting in a delay in the sintering
   stages of coarse powder. The isothermal densification kinetic behaviors
   of tungsten powder show that the densification of tungsten powder can be
   divided into two kinetic stages: a low-stress exponent segment (n = 1.5)
   and a high-stress exponent segment (n = 3 or 4). With increasing of
   particle size, n increases from 3 to 4, and the activation energy
   decreases from 304 to 254 kJ/mol for the high-stress exponent segment.
   This is because the densification mechanism has a tendency to change
   from diffusion creep to dislocation creep or dislocation glide as the
   particle size increases. The evolution of the activation energy exactly
   matches the transformation of the deformation mechanism, indicating that
   the densification activation energy does not reflect a barrier to
   densification, but rather a barrier to deformation with different
   deformation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Background This study evaluated whether the Controlling Nutritional
   Status (CONUT) score could predict clinical outcomes in ST elevation
   myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients.
   Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of STEMI patients
   after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). The endpoint
   was major adverse cardiac event (MACE). Information was obtained from
   medical records and via telephone calls. Patients were divided into
   three groups: normal (CONUT score 0-1; n=278), mild-moderate (score 2-4;
   n=418), and severe (score >= 5; n=55) groups.
   Results During the 24.6 +/- 12 months follow-up, MACEs were observed in
   65 (8.7\%) patients. The incidence of MACEs was 6.1\%, 5.5\%, and 45.5\%
   in the normal, mild-moderate, and severe group, respectively (p<0.001).
   Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that patients with a CONUT score >= 5 had
   the significantly highest rate of MACE, myocardial re-infarction, and
   vessel revascularisation. In three Cox proportional hazard models, the
   CONUT scores were unexceptionally associated with MACE, even after
   adjusting all other variables (hazard ratio, 12.09; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI], 5.09-28.7; p<0.001). The C-statistic of the CONUT score
   for the prediction of MACE was 0.692 (95\% CI, 0.613-0.771; p<0.001),
   which is close to that of Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events.
   Conclusions The nutritional status evaluated by the CONUT score can
   independently predict clinical outcomes in STEMI patients, which
   suggests that active nutritional management is meaningful for these
   patients after PCI.}},

Volume = {{99}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We used the ``technique for order preference by similarity to ideal
   solution{''} model to measure port comprehensive strength and its
   spatial features on the basis of the concept of regional balanced
   development during the period of port resources integration. Using the
   panel data for coastal cities from 2001 to 2017, we built a spatial
   econometric model of port comprehensive strength to explore the effect
   of port comprehensive strength on economic growth and its spatial
   spillover effect. The study found the following: (1) The hierarchical
   structure of China's coastal ports has expanded toward a flat pyramid
   structure, the shift of which enlarges middle- and high-level ports and
   shrinks the low-level ones; China's coastal port groups present a
   ``core-periphery structure,{''} which focuses on international and
   national hubs. (2) China's coastal port comprehensive strength has a
   significant spatial spillover effect on the economic growth in local and
   neighboring cities; for every 1\% increase in port comprehensive
   strength, the peripheral economic growth contributes by 0.08\% and
   0.04\%. (3) The spatial spillover effect of coastal port comprehensive
   strength on the scale of the port group reflects a spatial
   conglomeration effect and regional differences: the coastal port
   comprehensive strength of the Pearl River Delta and the Southeast
   coastal area presents direct and indirect double spillover effects, the
   port groups in the Yangtze River Delta and Southeast coastal area have a
   direct spillover effect only, and the Southwest port groups have a
   double negative spillover effect.}},

   evidence based on Copula-DCC-GARCH model and selected clustering methods}},
Journal = {{ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{7-27}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this article is to study the correlations
   between the most important European insurers and their participation in
   systemic risk in the insurance sector. We compare systemic risk in
   different market regimes.
   Research Design \& Methods: We use statistical clustering methods for
   time units (weeks) to which we assign conditional variances obtained
   from the estimated Copula-Dynamic Conditional Correlations-Generalised
   Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroske-dasticity model (C-DCC-GARCH). In
   each of the identified market regimes we determine the Conditional Value
   at Risk CoVaR systemic risk measure.
   Findings: In this article we show a positive correlation of all the
   insurance companies under consideration. During global market crises the
   correlation appears stronger than in `normal times.' This confirms that
   the insurance sector generates systemic risk in the presence of
   turbulences on financial markets, since the value level of the compared
   index CoVar is much higher in these conditions.
   Implications \& Recommendations: Our research confirms the insurance
   sector's contribution to Systemic Risk. Thus, it is important to develop
   an analysis of systemic risk with a particular attention to the
   evolution of risk in time and the institutions' interconnectedness in
   the context of contagion using also some new modelling tools.
   Contribution \& Value Added: A novel approach of this article is the
   analysis of dependencies in the insurance sector using the C-DCC-GARCH
   model with taxonomic methods.}},

Abstract = {{Interpretations of Nietzsche as a virtue theorist have proliferated in
   recent years, although these accounts typically avoid his trenchant
   criticisms of both the desirability of virtue and the stability of
   character. In this article, I argue that these criticisms must be
   tackled head-on in order to understand Nietzsche's own character-based
   ethics. After examining Nietzsche's criticisms of the egoistical
   dimensions of so-called ``moral virtues{''}, along with his genealogical
   account of their development, we propose that a Nietzschean virtue
   ethics can only be developed by acknowledging his intellectual debt to
   Machiavelli's notion of virtu. While both countenance a resolutely
   non-moral notion of virtue, one which applies self-knowledge and
   character excellences in the service of practical goals, their accounts
   diverge insofar as Nietzsche views virtue as integral to individual
   self-overcoming in a way that the more politically minded Machiavelli
   does not.}},

Title = {{An analysis of the policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in France,
   Belgium, and Canada}},
Journal = {{HEALTH POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{430-446}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: This paper presents an overview and comparative analysis of
   the epidemiological situation and the policy responses in France,
   Belgium, and Canada during the early stages of the 2020 Covid-19
   pandemic (Feb.-Aug. 2020). These three countries are compared because
   they represent a spectrum of different governance structures while also
   being OECD nations that are similar in many other respects.
   Methods: A rapid review of primary data from the three countries was
   conducted. Data was collected from official government documents
   whenever possible, supplemented by information from international
   databases and local media reports. The data was then analysed to
   identify common patterns as well as significant divergences across the
   three countries, especially in the areas of health policy and technology
   use.
   Results: France, Belgium and Canada faced differing epidemiological
   situations during the Covid-19 pan-demic, and the wide variety of policy
   actions taken appears to be linked to existing governance and healthcare
   structures. The varying degrees of federalism and regional autonomy
   across the three countries highlight the different constraints faced by
   national policy-makers within different governance models.
   Conclusions: The actions taken by all three countries appear to have
   been largely dictated by existing health system capacity, with
   increasing federalism associated with more fragmented strategies and
   less coordination across jurisdictions. However, the implications of
   certain policies related to economic resilience and health system
   capacity cannot yet be fully evaluated and may even prove to have net
   negative impacts into the future. (c) 2020 Fellowship of Postgraduate

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Complex hydroclimate in the United States and Canada has limited
   identification of possible ongoing changes in streamflow. We address
   this challenge by classifying 541 stations in the United States and
   Canada into 15 ``hydro-regions,{''} each with similar seasonal
   streamflow characteristics. Analysis of seasonal streamflow records at
   these stations from 1910 to present indicates regionally coherent
   changes in the frequency of extreme high- and low-flow events. Where
   changes are significant, these events have, on average, doubled in
   frequency relative to 1950 to 1969. In hydro-regions influenced by
   snowmelt runoff, extreme high-flow event frequency has increased despite
   snowpack depletion by warming winter temperatures. In drought-prone
   hydro-regions of the western United States and Southeast, extreme
   low-flow event frequency has increased, particularly during summer and
   fall. The magnitude and regional consistency of these hydrologic changes
   warrant attention by watershed stakeholders. The hydro-region framework
   facilitates quantification and further analyses of these changes to
   extreme streamflow.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Social media is increasingly used by people during large-scale natural
   disasters to request emergency help. Previous work has had success in
   applying machine-learning classifiers to detect tweets in coarse-grained
   categories, such as disaster type and relevance. However, there is a
   dearth of work that focuses on detecting tweets containing requests for
   help that are actionable by first responders. Using over 5 million
   tweets posted during 2017's Hurricane Harvey in Houston, U.S., we show
   that though such requests are uncommon, their often life-or death nature
   justifies the development of tweet classifiers to detect them. We find
   that the best-performing classifiers are a convolutional neural network
   (CNN) trained on word embeddings, support vector machine (SVM) trained
   on average word embeddings, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained on a
   combination of unigrams and part-of-speech (POS) tags. These models
   achieve F1 scores of over 0.86, confirming their efficacy in detecting
   urgent tweets. We highlight the utility of average word embeddings for
   training non-neural models, and that such features produce results
   competitive with more traditional n-gram and POS features.}},

   surgeons have transitioned to treating gangrenous appendicitis with a
   single perioperative dose, while others are concerned about increased
   risk of infection in this population.
   Methods: We developed a pathway for the management of patients
   undergoing appendectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis which
   included same-day discharge and elimination of postoperative antibiotics
   for patients with gangrenous appendicitis. We compared outcomes for
   children treated at our institution before and after implementation of
   the protocol.
   Results: We identified 575 patients undergoing appendectomy for
   uncomplicated appendicitis (307 preand 268 post-protocol). We observed a
   significant decrease in postoperative length-of stay (10.6 to 2.6 h, p b
   0.0001). There were no increases in postoperative complications, such as
   superficial (2.6\% vs 1.1\%, p = 0.19) or organ space surgical-site
   infection (1.6\% vs 0.4\%, p = 0.14), percutaneous drain placement
   (1.3\% vs 0\%, p = 0.06), postoperative ED visits (5.5\% vs 5.2\%, p =
   0.87) or readmission (3.3\% vs 1.5\%, p = 0.17).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that incorporating same-day
   discharge for simple appendicitis and eliminating postoperative
   antibiotics for children with gangrenous appendicitis does not increase
   complication rates. Implementation of similar pathways across
   institutions has the potential to significantly reduce resource
   utilization for children undergoing appendectomy for uncomplicated
   appendicitis. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted a reconsideration, perhaps even a
   fundamental shift in our relationships with place. As people worldwide
   have experienced `lockdown,' we find ourselves emplaced in new and
   complex ways. In this Commentary, we draw attention to the re-working of
   people-place relations that the pandemic has catalysed thus far. We
   offer insights and suggestions for future interdisciplinary research,
   informed by our diverse positionalities as researchers based in
   different continents employing diverse approaches to people-place
   research. The article is structured in two sections. First, we consider
   theoretical aspects of our current relationships to place by proposing a
   framework of three interdependent axes: emplacement-displacement,
   inside-outside, and fixity-flow. Second, we identify six implications of
   these dialectics: for un-making and re-making `home'; precarity,
   exclusion and non-normative experiences of place; a new politics of
   public space; health, wellbeing and access to `outside' recreational
   spaces; re-sensing place, virtual escapes and fluid places, and
   methodological and ethical considerations. Across these topics, we
   identify 15 key questions to guide future research. We conclude by
   asserting that learning lessons from the global pandemic is necessarily
   tentative, requiring careful observation of altered life circumstances,
   and will be deficient without taking relationships with place into
   account.}},

Abstract = {{Based on ethnographic fieldwork among local communities and shipbreaking
   workers, this essay focuses on the lived experiences of toxicity in the
   rapidly industrializing zone of Sitakunda, Bangladesh. Shipbreaking is
   receiving attention as a zone of toxic exposure. There is pressure for

   forms of pollution in the industrial zone of Sitakunda, such as water,
   air and noise pollution, are neglected or ignored. Worries about
   pollution and health highlight the unevenness of promises of development
   to come, also expressed by marginalized fishing communities structurally
   excluded from industrialization. My interlocutors describe unnayan
   (economic development) as bishakto (poisonous, toxic). I conceptualize
   this as `toxic development' to draw attention to how `ordinary people'
   (migrant workers, fishing and agricultural communities, shipbreaking
   workers and manual labourers) without capital, land or social networks
   of influence endure poisonous industrial activities that both create
   livelihoods and destroy them.}},

Abstract = {{Seagrass known as Lamun in Bahasa is one of the species that are can
   live in submerged marine habitats. Seagrasses have an important role in
   the ecosystems, including as primary producers, living habitats of
   benthic organisms, stabilize bed sediments and carbon storage in
   shallow- water coastal. Monospecies community of seagrass was found in
   Malang, however, only limited number studies of seagrass have been done
   in the area. This study aimed to determine the growth rate and biomass
   of the seagrass, as well as the phytochemical compounds. Experiments
   were conducted during August-November in 2014 and 2015. Measurement of
   in situ growth and biomass leaf were made using marking techniques in
   one week also the data of leaf seagrass collected were using a random
   sampling method. Extracted materials were tested by methanol to get the
   phytochemical compound. Data were analyzed at the Fisheries and Marine
   Exploration Laboratory, FPIK-UB. The results of the present study showed
   that two species of seagrass, Syringodium isoetifolium at Kondang Merak
   and Thalassia hemprichii at Bale Kambang. The growth rate of the
   seagrass leaves of the former species had positive values with 0.45 +/-
   0.19 cm/day, while the later species had 0.25 +/- 0.14 cm/day.
   Furthermore, the biomass value of the two types seagrass obtained that
   in the below-ground was higher than the above-ground. Phytochemical
   tests showed that both of type seagrass contained bioactive compounds
   such as flavonoids and saponins.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the human gene homologs are found in Caenorhabditis elegans. As
   a wide variety of micro-organisms present in the environment is
   pathogens, so, C. elegans could be a useful model to track future
   infectious disease. With this knowledge, in this study, we isolated
   Acinetobacter courvalinii from the soil and characterized its
   pathogenicity for the first time. For the isolation, we used
   Glucose-Yeast extract-Ethanol-Calcium carbonate medium. To this aim, we
   evaluated the resistivity of bacteria against several stressful
   microenvironments. As we observed, A. courvalinii JP\_A1001 shown highly
   tolerance against the acidic environment (pH 3-7), resistant against up
   to 0.2\% of phenol content, and survived in the medium supplemented with
   0.3\% of bile salt. In addition, the bacteria were also resistant
   against several antibiotics showing the property of multidrug-resistant
   bacteria. Moreover, the isolated bacteria have shown the biofilm
   formation ability within 60 h. Further, we found that incubation of C.
   elegans with A. courvalinii JP\_A1001 decreased the body movement and
   increased the free radical generation which remarkably influenced the
   life expectancy of C. elegans compared to E. coli OP50. Therefore, we
   concluded that A. courvalinii JP\_A1001 found in the soil could be a
   future threat as a pathogen to public health.}},

Abstract = {{We augmented a macro-model with intrinsic-inflation inertia assuming
   that prices farer in the past are more likely to be reset. We estimated
   the model for seven industrialized economies to compare their price/wage
   structures and to explore the potential nexus between changes the

   duration-dependent-price adjustments in all the country of the sample.
   Although positively sloped, after few periods, price-hazard functions
   often become flat as in Calvo-based models. Instead, wage-hazard shapes
   are in line with Taylor contracts with the exceptions of France and the
   United Kingdom. Country comparison shows that price and wage stickiness
   are correlated. Regarding monetary policy stances, no systematic effect

   versus Testing Required by Codes: Experimental Case Studies}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Passive energy dissipation systems are one of the most resilient
   solutions to mitigate the seismic risk of structures. In case of strong
   motions, they can confine the eventual damages into easily replaceable
   anti-seismic devices. The performance characteristics of nonlinear
   displacement dependent devices (NLD) shall be defined by the
   force-displacement cyclic behavior, as well as the expected number of
   cycles related to both the duration of the earthquake and to the
   fundamental frequency of the structural systems. The aims of this paper
   are the comparison between the dynamic results of two different
   experimental campaigns performed on NLDs included in dissipative bracing
   systems and the assessment of the reliability of quasi-static testing
   procedures proposed by current seismic codes for type tests and factory
   production control tests. The number of cycles under the design
   earthquake of hysteretic dampers were experimentally evaluated through
   shaking table testing. Two experimental case studies of a two-story
   steel frame and of a three-story post-tensioned timber frame both with
   bracing systems including flexural steel dampers, hysteretic dampers
   (HDs), and U-shaped flexural plates (UFPs) respectively, were analyzed.
   Controlled-displacement tests of NLDs were performed considering
   quasi-static loading procedures specified by codes. Shaking table tests
   were carried out considering almost the same seismic sequence composed
   by a set of seven natural earthquakes at increasing peak ground
   acceleration (PGA) levels. More than one hundred inelastic cycles were
   experimentally recorded from dynamic tests before the failure of devices
   in both cases. In line with American standards testing requirements, the
   number of cycles at the design PGA level, estimated from shaking table
   tests and from non-linear dynamic analyses, shows a decreasing trend
   with the increase of ductility demand.}},

Title = {{Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and psychological distress symptoms in
   patients with affective disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic}},
Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{122}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to stress worldwide,
   especially in vulnerable people like those suffering from mental
   illness. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress
   perceived by a cohort of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
   or Bipolar Disorder (BD) after a seven-week period of lockdown measures,
   and to analyze serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D {[}25(OH)D] levels as a
   potential predictor of distress severity.
   Methods. Fifty-nine remitted MDD and fifty-three euthymic BD patients
   were enrolled. An online dedicated survey was administered to obtain
   lockdown-related information and to evaluate COVID-19 related distress
   by using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Patients'
   medical records were reviewed to collect sociodemographic and clinical
   data, including serum 25(OH)D levels dosed in the three months preceding
   the outbreak. A multivariate general linear model was adopted to test
   the effect of factors of interest on psychological distress.
   Results. In our sample (n = 112), 29 subjects (25.9 \%) reported no
   likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 35 (31.2 \%) and 48 (42.9
   \%) displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood of psychological
   distress, respectively. Low serum 25(OH)D levels (p = 0.005) and MDD
   diagnosis (p = 0.001) specifically predicted the severity of
   psychological distress. Living alone during the lockdown, a longer
   duration of illness, and smoking habits were more frequently detected in
   subjects with COVID-19 related distress.
   Conclusions. Low serum 25(OH)D levels and MDD diagnosis predicted an
   increased vulnerability to the stressful impact of the COVID-19
   outbreak. Our results suggest that vitamin D may represent a biological
   factor mediating the psychological response to stress in individuals
   with affective disorders and provide further insight into tailoring
   intervention strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the RA.DI.CA. splint
   in the management of temporomandibular joint disc displacement without
   reduction (ADDwoR) and jaw functional limitation. The authors developed
   a retrospective clinical study. A total of 2739 medical records were
   screened. One hundred and forty-one patients with chronic unilateral
   disc displacement without reduction and jaw limitation, treated with a
   multifunctional RA.DI.CA. splint, were enrolled. Temporomandibular pain,
   headache, familiar pain, neck pain, and emotional strain, maximum
   spontaneous mouth opening, and lateral excursions were evaluated at
   baseline (T0), after therapy (T1), and during the follow-up (T2).
   Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Wilcoxon test assessed
   changes in symptomatology and functional aspects before and after
   treatment and between T1 and T2, with p < 0.05. Ninety-nine patients
   (70\%) declared themselves ``healed{''} from jaw functional limitation
   with no residual painful symptoms, 31 (22\%) improved their symptoms and
   jaw function, 11 (8\%) reported no changes compared to T0 and no one
   worsened. As for all parameters analyzed, the comparison between the
   ones before and after treatment was statistically significant (p <
   0.05). The RA.DI.CA. splint proved to be highly performing and promoting
   functional and symptomatologic recovery, also in the medium and long
   term, through the restoration of the functional disc-condyle
   relationship and the healing of joint tissues.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a new cosmological inflationary model which is
   constructed using the Ivanov-Salopek-Bond method with a logistic
   generating function. We derive the inflationary observables as well as
   the duration and temperature of the subsequent reheating epoch of our
   model exactly, with no need to recur to the slow roll approximation. The
   obtained scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio of
   perturbations fall comfortably within the range of the measurements
   presented by the Planck collaboration. On the other hand, for the
   reheating era, our model predicts a relatively small number of e-folds
   and thus high temperatures, still within range of Planck's bounds. We
   then consider a generalization of our model that we refer to as
   Bernoulli-like functions and examine different scenarios that are
   encompassed within this generalization.}},

Abstract = {{The poorly known sponge species Axinella vellerea (Topsent, 1904),
   Acarnus levii (Vacelet, 1960) and Haliclona poecillastroides (Vacelet,
   1969) are reported from bottom-trawl samples off the Balearic Islands,
   Western Mediterranean. A re-description is provided for all three
   species and the Folmer fragment of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI)
   obtained for A. levii and H. poecillastroides. This is the second report
   of A. vellerea in the Mediterranean, the first time that A. levii is
   reported outside Corsica and the first time that H. poecillastroides is
   documented outside the Gulf of Lion, France. The systematic allocation
   of A. levii and H. poecillastroides is discussed based on a COI
   phylogenetic analysis and morphology. The poorly understood phylogeny of
   the Haplosclerida does not permit us to find a proper allocation for H.
   poecillastroides, although its current position in the genus Haliclona
   or the family Chalinidae is not defensible. On the other hand, A. levii
   currently fits best in the family Microcionidae, and seems related to
   some Clathria species with mixed features between Clathria and Acarnus.
   Considering that the species of the genus Acarnus shares a strong
   synapomorphy (the possession of Cladotylotes), it is plausible for all
   Acarnus species to be Microcionids. We conclude that H. poecillastroides
   needs to be reallocated to a new genus: Xestospongia poecillastroides
   comb. nov. (Petrosiidae). However, a reallocation of A. levii is not
   advisable for the moment, as this would imply major systematic changes
   such as the reallocation of the whole genus Acarnus to Microcionidae,
   and the redescription of Microcionidae and Acarnidae.}},

Abstract = {{While the International Baccalaureate's Middle Years Programme (MYP) is
   growing in popularity in Australia and across the globe, few studies
   have examined the benefits and challenges of this IB programme for
   supporting student learning. Using a qualitative case study design of
   three Australian schools that formerly offered the MYP, we investigated
   teacher and school leader perceptions of the MYP for promoting student
   learning. Perceived benefits included high achievement and skill
   development through the MYP's emphasis on inquiry-based learning and
   real-world relevance; criterion-referenced assessments; and a healthy
   balance between core and elective learning areas. Challenges for
   students stemmed primarily from operational difficulties and possible
   systems-level constraints impacting teachers, including integration of
   the Australian Curriculum with the MYP; ability to meet the MYP's
   demands; confusion about MYP terminology and grading systems; and
   understanding interdisciplinary units. The findings suggest that MYP
   Coordinators and school leaders play a critical role in ensuring that
   schools realise the benefits of the MYP for student learning by
   providing systems-level support to optimise its benefits.}},

Abstract = {{With the precedence of connected automated vehicles (CAVs),
   car-following control technology is a promising way to enhance traffic
   safety. Although a variety of research has been conducted to analyze the
   safety enhancement by CAV technology, the parametric impact on CAV
   technology has not been systematically explored. Hence, this paper
   analyzes the parametric impacts on surrogate safety measures (SSMs) for
   a mixed vehicular platoon via a two-level analysis structure. To
   construct the active safety evaluation framework, numerical simulations
   were constructed which can generate trajectories for different kind of
   vehicles while considering communication and vehicle dynamics
   characteristics. Based on the trajectories, we analyzed parametric
   impacts upon active safety on two different levels. On the microscopic
   level, parameters including controller dynamic characteristics and
   equilibrium time headway of car-following policies were analyzed, which
   aimed to capture local and aggregated driving behavior's impact on the
   vehicle. On the macroscopic level, parameters incorporating market
   penetration rate (MPR), vehicle topology, and vehicle-to-vehicle
   environment were extensively investigated to evaluate their impacts on
   aggregated platoon level safety caused by inter-drivers' behavioral
   differences. As indicated by simulation results, an automated vehicle
   (AV) suffering from degradation is a potentially unsafe component in
   platoon, due to the loss of a feedforward control mechanism. Hence, the
   introduction of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) only start showing
   benefits to platoon safety from about 20\% CAV MPR in this study.
   Furthermore, the analysis on vehicle platoon topology suggests that
   arranging all CAVs at the front of a mixed platoon assists in enhancing
   platoon SSM performances.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Burgeoning growth of tall buildings in urban areas around the world is
   placing new demands on their performance under winds. This involves
   selection of the building form that minimizes wind loads and structural
   topologies that efficiently transfer loads. Current practice is to
   search for optimal shapes, but this limits buildings with static or
   fixed form. Aerodynamic shape tailoring that consists of modifying the
   external form of the building has shown great promise in reducing wind
   loads and associated structural motions as reflected in the design of
   Taipei 101 and Burj Khalifa. In these buildings, corner modifications of
   the cross-section and tapering along the height are introduced. An
   appealing alternative is to design a building that can adapt its form to
   the changing complex wind environment in urban areas with clusters of
   tall buildings, i.e., by implementing a dynamic facade. To leap beyond
   the static shape optimization, autonomous dynamic morphing of the
   building shape is advanced in this study, which is implemented through a
   cyber-physical system that fuses together sensing, computing, actuating,
   and engineering informatics. This approach will permit a building to
   intelligently morph its profile to minimize the source of dynamic wind
   load excitation, and holds the promise of revolutionizing tall buildings
   from conventional static to dynamic facades by taking advantage of the
   burgeoning advances in computational design. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the family free-rider problem by investigating the
   effects of unmarried sisters on brothers' outcomes based on historical
   population register data from the China Multi Generational Panel
   Dataset-Liaoning (CMGPD-LN). The results show that the presence of an
   unmarried sister increases the probability of her brother to have
   another birth / obtain an official student title. An unmarried sister
   represents a family public good provider since she is a temporary

   compete for and free ride on his sister's unpaid housework. This paper
   provides an economic explanation rooted in an individual motivation that
   may help us to further understand the impacts of family structure.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new multi-segmented radiant ceiling panel with
   different tilt angle is proposed. The effect of segments inclination
   angle and panel area increase for the same coverage ratio are
   investigated. A 3-dimension computational fluid dynamics model is
   developed and validated for these comparisons. It is concluded that
   increasing segments angle decrease the ratio between the radiation and
   total heat exchange. In addition, using the multi-segments allows the
   air to move from the plenum area to the central zone of the room.
   Further, the operative temperature for the +/- 45 degrees is minimum
   with best value for the predicted mean vote and lowest value of
   predicted percentage dissatisfied compared with +/- 30 degrees, +/- 75
   degrees and 90 degrees. And increasing the panel area with 300\%
   increased the panel cooling capacity by around 140\% for the same indoor
   temperature of 25.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C and the same ceiling area. This
   research found that the cooling capacity is proportional to the area of
   the radiant panel, but under the same ceiling area, when the area ratio
   exceeds a certain value, the thermal performance will decrease due to
   the reduction of the convection heat transfer coefficient. (C) 2020 The

   three cohort studies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The association of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC)
   with risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) has been inconsistent in
   previous studies.
   Methods
   We examined the associations of BMI and WC in relation to risk of GBS
   among 252,980 participants from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS-II,
   and the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS). BMI and WC were
   assessed by self-reported questionnaire, and GBS cases were
   self-reported.
   Results
   We documented 328 incident GBS cases during a total of 5,422,788 person
   years of follow-up. Compared to participants with BMI<25kg/m(2), the
   multivariate pooled hazard ratio (HR) of GBS was 1.34 (95\% CI: 1.04,
   1.73) for overweight participants (25kg/m(2)<= BMI<30 kg/m(2)), and 1.68
   (95\% CI: 1.21, 2.35) for obese participants (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) (P for
   trend = 0.001). Compared to participants with normal WC (<35 inches for
   women and <40 inches for men), the HR of GBS was 1.55 (95\% CI: 1.10,
   2.18) for participants with high WC (>= 35 inches for women, and >= 40
   inches for men). The positive associations of BMI and WC with risk of
   GBS were attenuated to null after mutually adjusting for BMI and WC.
   Joint analysis showed that the HR was 1.84 (95\% CI: 1.27, 2.66) for
   participants with high WC and BMI >= 25 kg/m(2) in comparison to
   participants with normal WC and BMIConclusion
   These data from large cohorts showed that higher BMI and WC jointly were
   associated with higher risk of GBS. Our study highlighted the importance
   of maintaining a normal body weight and waist circumference in
   prevention of GBS.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the characteristics of rapid melting and solidification of
   selective laser melting (SLM) process in preparing Inconel 738 alloy,
   there is residual stress in alloy, so the alloy cannot be directly used.
   Thus, stress relief annealing is required. The evolution of residual
   stress, precipitation behavior, microstructure and properties of the
   alloy after annealing at different temperatures (700 similar to 900
   degrees C) for 24 h was studied. The results show that the
   microstructure evolution mechanism is static recovery, while dislocation
   migration, rearrangement and grain boundary style change occur and a
   bimodal distribution of spherical gamma' phase (50 similar to 250 nm)
   and short rod-shaped gamma' phase (240 similar to 440 nm) are formed.
   The grain boundary carbides change from a dotted state to a continuous
   one and the type of carbides changes from MC to M23C6; after annealing
   at 800 degrees C, the residual stress decreases from 380.94 MPa
   (as-SLMed) to 66.7 MPa, indicating the residual stress is eliminated.
   With the annealing temperature increasing, the microhardness and tensile
   strength first increase and then decrease, and the elongation increases
   gradually. The alloy annealed at 800 degrees C has the highest
   microhardness (HV) and tensile strength (5812, 1330 MPa), which are 1.42
   and 1.41 times of those of as-cast alloy (4100, 945 MPa), respectively.}},

Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{157}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum var. Genovese) is an important medicinal
   herb and is considered to be a moderately salt-tolerant plant. However,
   little is known about the effect of biochar on enhancing its salinity
   tolerance. The response of basil plant to water salinity (8 dS m(-1),
   NaCl salinity) and three levels of biochar i. e., C, BC1, and BC2 (0, 1,
   and 2 \% by weight) was investigated, as was the effect of biochar on
   NH3 volatilization kinetics. Irrigation of basil plants with saline
   water reduced the plant height, fresh weight, and dry weight by 27 \%,
   18 \%, and 17 \% in comparison to tap water. The application of biochar
   to saline irrigated basil caused remarkable increases in all the
   recorded growth parameters. Water salinity reduced N, P, and K
   availability and shoot concentrations. When applied, BC1 and BC2 under
   saline conditions increased shoot concentrations of N by 42 \% and 67
   \%; P by 40 \% and 70 \% and K by 15 \% and 50 \%. Water salinity
   increased the concentrations of proline and phenolic compounds by 15 and
   70 \%, respectively; moreover, it reduced the total chlorophyll by 10
   \%. Water salinity reduced the oil yield by 15 \%. The overall oil yield
   was increased by 18 and 38 \% as a result of BC1 and BC2 application.
   The salinity of irrigation water increased the NH3 volatilization and
   reduced its half-life by 34 \%. On the other hand, biochar reduced NH3
   volatilization and increased its half-life. Biochar improved the growth
   and yield of basil plants by improving the efficiency of photosynthesis
   and the absorption of essential nutrients. It also had a role in
   reducing the concentrations of biochemical substances produced under
   salt stress. Therefore, using biochar is a good strategy for reducing
   NH3 volatilization and enhancing soil quality and plant productivity
   under saline irrigation.}},

Title = {{Investigation of alterations in PIK3CA and OCT-4 gene expression in
   breast cancer}},
Journal = {{GENE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Breast cancer (BCa) is one of the most prevalent cancer amongst women
   and PIK3CA mutations have a crucial role in carcinogenesis. On the other
   hand, Octamer-Binding Transcription Factor 4 (OCT-4) is common
   biomarkers of cancer stem cells, which provide to the pathological
   processes of numerous carcinomas. In this study, we evaluated the
   association of OCT-4 gene expression levels with the PIK3CA mutation in
   BCa patients.
   The mRNA expression level of the OCT-4 gene was detected by qPCR in 44
   BCa patients and 30 BCa patients control have positive PIK3CA mutations.
   Exon 9 and exon 20 of PIK3CA mutations were identified by sequencing.
   OCT-4 gene expression and PIK3CA mutations were also clinically
   evaluated in BCa patients.
   The frequency of PIK3CA mutation in 44 new cases were 32\%. PIK3CA
   mutations were significantly associated with HER2-positive (p = 0.0271)
   status, Ki-67 status (p = 0.0434) and patient age (p = 0.0149). OCT-4
   mRNA expression was significantly higher in the BCa tissue in comparison
   to normal breast tissue (p = 0.0305). A significant correlation was
   found between expression of OCT-4 and node status (p = 0.0190). OCT-4
   mRNA expression was higher in the PIK3CA mutation tissue than the wild
   type tissue. However, no association was found between the expression of
   OCT-4 and the PIK3CA mutation or wild type samples (p = 0.7908).
   Our results provided that OCT-4 gene and PIK3CA mutations may have a
   role in development of BCa. OCT-4 mRNA expression level and PIK3CA
   mutations have a potential important for BCa diagnosis or treatment.}},

Title = {{Integrating functionalized magnetite nanoparticles with low salinity
   water and surfactant solution: Interfacial tension study}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{281}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, citric acid-coated magnetic (CACM) nanoparticles (NPs)
   were synthesized and utilized as an interfacial tension (IFT) reduction
   agent. In addition, the effect of three types of salts at different
   concentrations up to 150,000 ppm was investigated. These salts, NaCl,
   CaCl2, and MgCl2, showed the IFT values of 19.34, 16.24 and 12.23 mN/m,
   respectively, at the optimum salinity condition. The IFT decreased
   swiftly with increasing brine concentration at the beginning and then,
   increased after the optimum point due to the effect of asphaltenes and
   salts, respectively. Meanwhile, CACM NPs indicated a very significant
   capability to reduce the IFT value down to 3.99 mN/m without using any
   surfactant. The CACM NPs, among the other NPs used in this study, have
   shown a key role in IFT reduction due to their acidic feature (these NPs
   were coated by citric acid). Consequently, the combination of the NPs
   with surfactant at low salinity condition, showed major changes (for
   Fe2O3 and SiO2 NPs) and minor changes (for CACM NPs) at the interface as
   the movement of the surfactants by the NPs to the interface increases
   the surface-active agents at interface for reducing the IFT. The
   findings of this study can help to gain a better understanding of the
   IFT behavior using magnetite NPs in combination with surfactant at low
   salinity condition.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Following the death of George Floyd, Facebook posts about the Black
   Lives Matter movement (BLM) surged, creating the opportunity to examine
   reactions by race and sex. This study employed a two-part mixed methods
   approach beginning with an analysis of posts from a single college
   student's Facebook newsfeed over a 12-week period, commencing on the
   date of George Floyd's death (25 May 2020). A triangulation protocol
   enhanced exploratory observational-archival Facebook posts with
   qualitative data from 24 Black and White college students queried about
   their views of BLM and policing. The Facebook data revealed that White
   males, who were the least active in posting about BLM, were most likely
   to criticize BLM protests. They also believed incidents of police
   brutality were exceptions that tainted an otherwise commendable
   profession. In contrast, Black individuals commonly saw the case of
   George Floyd as consistent with a longstanding pattern of injustice that
   takes an emotional toll, and as an egregious exemplification of racism
   that calls for indictment of the status quo. The exploratory data in
   this article also illustrate how even for a cause celebre, attention on
   Facebook ebbs over time. This phenomenon obscures the urgency of
   effecting change, especially for persons whose understanding of racism
   is influenced by its coverage on social media. The need to recognize the
   divergence of views-how they vary by sex and race and their connection
   to social media-remains critical for progress in determining the best
   steps forward in race relations and police reform.}},

   Contracture: A New Design Approach}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Shockwave therapy is a noninvasive treatment technique used in
   multidisciplinary fields, such as sports medicine, physical therapy, and
   orthopedics. This method of treatment is recommended for medical
   conditions, such as muscle contractions, intramuscular hematoma, or
   Dupuytren's contracture. The shockwaves are high-energy pressure waves
   characterized by nonlinearity, high frequency, and peak pressure
   followed by low-pressure amplitude which are transmitted through an
   applicator to the affected tissue. In the case of spinal muscles, the
   conventional applicator can only be used on one side of the spinal cord
   at a time. Taking this into consideration, the approach suggested in
   this paper involves the design of a dedicated dual-tip applicator. This
   process implied predesign, finite element analysis, statistical analysis
   of the data, and optimization. We analyzed the input factors, such as
   frequency, pressure, applicator tip distance, shape, flatness, and
   material along with their effects, namely induced stress, tissue contact
   pressure, total strain energy, and propagation velocity. The proposed
   final design of the applicator uses geometric features suggested by the
   optimization analysis and also mechanical design features.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of brick-and-mortar composites depend on their
   interface fracture properties, which have not been evaluated to date,
   preventing a rational optimization of the microstructure and of the
   resulting mechanical properties. Micro-(cantilever) and macro-scale
   (Single Edge Notched Bending) tests on nacre-like alumina both result in
   crack initiation at the interface between the platelets. We assess crack
   initiation and predict the failure force by means of 2D and 3D finite
   element simulations employing the same fracture modeling approach at
   both scales, namely the coupled criterion. The interface fracture
   properties are determined by means of inverse identification based on
   both microand macro-scale experiments. The interface exhibits typical
   values of 438 MPa tensile strength and 1.96 J/m(2) fracture toughness.
   The forces at crack initiation predicted employing these parameters are
   in good agreement with the forces measured experimentally for both
   microand macro-scale tests. The quantitative determination of the
   interface fracture properties should help the design and optimization of
   this class of brick-and-mortar materials. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Comparison of Different Parameters to Evaluate Delamination in Edge
   Trimming of Basalt Fiber Reinforced Plastics (BFRP)}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Delamination is one of the main problems that occur when machining
   fiber-reinforced composite materials. In this work, Types I and II of
   delamination are studied separately in edge trimming of basalt fiber
   reinforced plastic (BFRP). For this purpose, one-dimensional and area
   delamination parameters are defined. One-dimensional parameters (Wa and
   Wb) allow to know average fibers length while the analysis of area
   delamination parameters (Sd) allow to evaluate delamination density. To
   study delamination, different tests are carried out modifying cutting
   parameters (cutting speed, feed per tooth and depth of cut) and material
   characteristics (fiber volume fraction and fiber orientation). Laminates
   with a lower fiber volume fraction do not present delamination.
   Attending to one-dimensional parameters it can be concluded that Type II
   delamination is more important than Type I and that a high depth of cut
   generates higher values of delamination parameters. An analysis of
   variance (ANOVA) is performed to study area parameters. Although
   delamination has a random nature, for each depth of cut, more influence
   variables in area delamination are firstly, feed per tooth and secondly,
   cutting speed.}},

Title = {{On the dynamics of closed-loop supply chains under remanufacturing lead
   time variability}},
Journal = {{OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{97}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Remanufacturing practices in closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) are often
   characterised by highly variable lead times due to the uncertain quality
   of returns. However, the impact of such variability on the dynamic
   benefits derived from adopting circular economy models remains largely
   unknown in the closed-loop literature. To fill the gap, this work
   analyses the Bullwhip and inventory performance of a multi-echelon CLSC
   with variable remanufacturing lead times under different scenarios of
   return rate and information transparency in the remanufacturing process.
   Our results reveal that ignoring such variability generally leads to an
   overestimation of the dynamic performance of CLSCs. We observe that
   enabling information transparency generally reduces order and inventory
   variability, but it may have negative effects on average inventory if
   the duration of the remanufacturing process is highly variable. Our
   findings result in useful and innovative recommendations for companies
   wishing to mitigate the negative consequences of lead time variability
   in CLSCs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a new class of carbon
   nanomaterials that have excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity,
   useful for cell labeling and bioimaging. However, it is challenging to
   reproducibly create CQDs that are uniform and small in size with
   controlled toxicity and fluorescence properties, and this status quo
   hinders the practical application of CQDs, especially in vivo. In this
   report, CQDs with a uniform size of similar to 1.53 +/- 0.42 nm are
   synthesized via in situ pyrolysis of organics confined in the
   smallest-pore zeolite SAPO-20 with a micropore aperture of 0.28 nm. The
   ultrasmall fluorescent CQDs show a bright green fluorescence with a
   quantum yield (QY) of 16\%, higher than that of most of the bare CQDs
   without any functionalization and maximum emission at 523 nm under the
   irradiation of xenon-light at an excitation wavelength of 470 nm. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization confirms the presence
   of rich carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the CQD surface containing N-
   and O-based functional groups. The synthesized CQDs with high QY and low
   cytotoxicity have been successfully used for cellular imaging with
   excellent biocompatibility.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the elegant anti-disturbance saturation control problem
   is discussed for a class of stochastic systems with multiple
   heterogeneous disturbances, which include three kinds of disturbance.
   One is the disturbance with partially known information. The other one
   is satisfying H-infinity-norm bounded. And the third one is white noise.
   A stochastic disturbance observer (SDO) is constructed to estimate the
   disturbance with partially known information. Based on the SDO and the
   characteristics of other two kinds of disturbance, a disturbance
   observer-based elegant anti-disturbance saturation control (DOBEADSC)
   scheme is proposed by combining disturbance observer based saturation
   control (DOBSC) and H-infinity control. With the proposed DOBEADSC
   scheme, the desired system robustness performance and higher
   anti-disturbance control accuracy can be achieved. Finally, two
   simulation examples, including a wind turbine system, are given to
   demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. - Establish recommendations for the management of UTIs in MS
   patients.
   Background. - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common during multiple
   sclerosis (MS) and are one of the most common comorbidities potentially
   responsible for deaths from urinary sepsis.
   Methods. - The recommendations attempt to answer three main questions
   about UTIs and MS. The French Group for Recommendations in MS
   (France4MS) did a systematic review of articles from PubMed and
   universities databases (01/1980-12/2019). The RAND/UCLA appropriateness
   method, which has been developed to synthesize the scientific literature
   and expert opinions on health care topics, was used for reaching a
   formal agreement. 26 MS experts worked on the full-text review and a
   group of 70 multidisciplinary health care specialists validated the
   final evaluation of summarized evidences.
   Results. - UTIs are not associated with an increased risk of relapse and
   permanent worsening of disability. Only febrile UTIs worsen transient
   disability through the Uhthoff phenomenon. Some immunosuppressive
   treatments increase the risk of UTIs in MS patients and require special
   attention especially in case of hypogammaglobulinemia. Experts recommend
   to treat UTIs in patients with MS, according to recommendations of the
   general population. Prevention of recurrent UTIs requires stabilization
   of the neurogenic bladder. In some cases, weekly oral cycling
   antibiotics can be proposed after specialist advice. Asymptomatic
   bacteriuria should not be screened for or treated systematically except
   in special cases (pregnancy and invasive urological procedures).
   Conclusion. - Physicians and patients should be aware of the updated
   recommendations for UTis and MS. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Journal = {{THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN RESPIRATORY DISEASE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims:
   Expansion and morphological dysregulation of the bronchial vascular
   network occurs in asthmatic airways. Interleukin (IL) -17 and Rho-kinase
   (ROCK) are known to act in inflammation control and remodeling.
   Modulation of Rho-kinase proteins and IL-17 may be a promising approach
   for the treatment of asthma through the control of angiogenesis. Our
   objective was to analyze the effects of treatment with anti-IL17 and/or
   Rho-kinase inhibitor on vascular changes in mice with chronic allergic
   pulmonary inflammation.
   Methods:
   Sixty-four BALB/c mice, with pulmonary inflammation induced by ovalbumin
   were treated with anti-IL17A (7.5/mu g per dose, intraperitoneal) and/or
   Rho-kinase inhibitor (Y-27632-10 mg/kg, intranasal), 1 h before each
   ovalbumin challenge (22, 24, 26, and 28/days). Control animals were made
   to inhale saline. At the end of the protocol, lungs were removed, and
   morphometric analysis was performed to quantify vascular inflammatory,
   remodeling, and oxidative stress responses.
   Results:
   Anti-IL17 or Rho-kinase inhibitor reduced the number of CD4(+), CD8(+),
   dendritic cells, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, Rho-kinase 1 and
   2, transforming growth factor (TGF-beta), vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF), nuclear factor (NF)-KappaB, iNOS, metalloproteinase
   (MMP)-9, MMP-12, metalloproteinase inhibitor-1 (TIMP-1), FOXP-3, signal
   transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and
   phospho-STAT1-positive cells, and actin, endothelin-1, isoprostane,
   biglycan, decorin, fibronectin and the collagen fibers volume fraction
   compared with the ovalbumin group (p < 0.05). The combination treatment,
   when compared with anti-IL17, resulted in potentiation of decrease in
   the number of IL1 beta- and dendritic cells-positive cells. When we
   compared the OVA-RHO inhibitor-anti-IL17 with OVA-RHO inhibitor we found
   a reduction in the number of CD8(+) and IL-17, TGF-beta, and
   phospho-STAT1-positive cells and endothelin-1 in the vessels (p < 0.05).
   There was an attenuation in the number of ROCK 2-positive cells in the
   group with the combined treatment when compared with anti-IL17 or
   Rho-kinase inhibitor-treated groups (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion:
   We observed no difference in angiogenesis after treatment with
   Rho-kinase inhibitor and anti-IL17. Although the treatments did not show
   differences in angiogenesis, they showed differences in the markers
   involved in the angiogenesis process contributing to inflammation
   control and vascular remodeling.

Abstract = {{Although providers have been using antibiotics for many decades in the
   setting of PPROM, the optimal regimen remains elusive and will likely
   continue to evolve. At this time, the recommended regimen includes a
   7-day course of ampicillin and erythromycin, with the first 2 days being
   intravenous and the last 5 being oral. Based on existing data, the
   substitution of azithromycin does not appear to impact maternal or
   neonatal outcomes, and has an improved side-effect profile. This regimen
   is used for PPROM after viability until 34 weeks, for both singletons
   and multiple gestations. Meta-analyses have shown that antibiotics for
   this indication are associated with lower rates of maternal and fetal
   infection, as well as longer pregnancy latency. Thus, latency
   antibiotics are recommended for all women with PPROM through 34 weeks of
   gestation.}},

Title = {{A complete computer aided engineering (CAE) modelling and optimization
   of high pressure die casting (HPDC) process}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{435-446}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The application of computer aided engineering (CAE) has become a trend
   in manufacture industry due to its great efficiency and reliability. In
   casting industries, numerical modelling of the casting process based on
   CAE has replaced traditional trial-and-error R\&D procedures in many
   aspects. With advanced parallel computing techniques and numerous
   calculation models, the fluid flow, heat transfer, solidification and
   defect formation behaviours under different casting conditions may be
   examined in detail. Based on this idea, component design and the
   optimization of casting parameters may be carried out to produce
   products for subsequent microstructural and mechanical characterization.
   In this way, a direct link between process condition, casting quality,
   and cast mechanical properties may be established in a manner that is
   practical, economical and energy efficient for such processes as gravity
   die casting, high pressure die casting (HPDC) and continuous casting.
   In this work, the entire HPDC process, including die heating, thermal
   die cycling, shot sleeve pre-filling, slow shot/fast shot injection, die
   filling/solidification as well as intensification, is simulated for an
   Al-Si alloy using the casting simulation package ProCAST. The
   interfacial heat transfer coefficients between melt and die wall/ shot
   sleeve are adjusted according to thermal couple measurements and
   infrared imaging of the die surface temperature distribution. Based on
   this complete numerical model, the HPDC process may be optimized using
   the following methodology: 1) the optimum thermal die cycle number is
   determined after which the dynamic steady state of die temperature is
   obtained to guarantee relatively sound casting quality. 2) The piston
   shot profile is adjusted to reduce defect formation during injection. In
   the meantime, tensile bars are cast using the optimized piston shot
   profile and the mechanical properties (yield strength, ultimate tensile
   strength and elongation) are tested to assess the effectiveness of the
   computer simulation. Results show that the mechanical properties are
   improved with the optimized process parameters, providing further
   evidence that CAE could help in the optimization of HPDC processes.}},

   low or insoluble Cd compounds in soil and its implication for

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{260}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This experiment is to explore whether one hyperaccumulator shows the
   strongly accumulative capacities for low or insoluble Cd compounds in
   soil. Soil potting experiment was conducted to analyze the accumulation
   capacity of Solanum nigrum L. for 10 different Cd compounds under two
   levels. The results clearly indicated: The Cd concentrations of shoots
   and roots were very high for different Cd compounds in soils even with
   low or insoluble Cd compounds compared with easily soluble Cd in the
   treatments of soil contaminated with Cd at different concentrations.
   Furthermore, the EFs and TFs were all larger than 1 either. Based on the
   results, although the bioavailabilities of some Cd compounds in soil
   were lower, S. nigrum's ability to accumulate them was still very
   strong. Phytoremediation may be widely used to treat with soil
   contaminated by different cadmium compounds. In addition, the total Cd
   content is also very important in evaluating the risk of Cd
   contamination in soil. Thus, phytoextraction is promising. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{This paper reviews and discusses research on arithmetical strengths and
   weaknesses in children with specific developmental cognitive
   disabilities. It focusses on children with dyslexia, developmental
   language disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.
   In general, studies show that arithmetical weaknesses are commoner in
   children with any of these disorders than in controls. Autism is
   sometimes associated with specific strengths in arithmetic; but even in
   autism, it is commoner for arithmetic to be a relative weakness than a
   relative strength. There may be some genetic reasons why there is an
   overlap between mathematical difficulties and other developmental
   learning difficulties; but much of the reason seems to be that specific
   aspects of arithmetic are often influenced by other factors, including
   language comprehension, phonological awareness, verbal and spatial
   working memory and long-term memory, and executive functions. The
   findings discussed here will be discussed in relation to Pennington's

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{55}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{History shows that pandemics can catalyse enormous change, fundamentally
   transforming the way people make sense of the world. Technologies can
   also be catalysts of change. While digital technologies are playing a
   vital role in tackling the covid-19 pandemic, the pandemic also presents
   a significant opportunity for digital technologies. Some experts believe
   the pandemic may permanently normalise the comprehensive societal use of
   digital technologies. This article casts a critical eye over the
   potential implications of this opportunity in the context of information
   systems (IS) research and development. We introduce and outline selected
   principles of Zygmunt Bauman's theory of liquid modernity. We then apply
   the liquid-modern principles to illustrative examples drawn from the
   covid-19 literature by focussing on three areas of established
   information systems interest: control, big data and information privacy.
   We show that traditional conceptualisations of scientific and societal
   order and control need to be reassessed; that big data alone cannot
   order clear and safe paths out of the current crisis and that
   information privacy regulations are irrelevant when undermined or
   circumvented by public and private actors. We conclude by making four
   recommendations for IS pandemic researchers and five practical
   recommendations in the context of the pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{In today's business world, there are two very important health issues
   that the employees in the service sector are faced with: Spinal disease,

   well-known musculoskeletal disorders. To preserve the health of its
   employees and prevent professional illnesses, and to thus maximize their
   efficiency, companies must use knowledge from the field of ergonomics.
   This study aims to examine the work-related health problems that the
   workers in transportation companies are faced with. As a case study, a
   postal company from Serbia is considered, with particular attention paid
   to the counter clerks. The research was carried out in one branch of the
   postal operator. All six postal clerks working at the considered branch
   were subjects of the study. The workers were observed visually by the
   researchers and recorded while performing their job tasks. Based on the
   analysis of their movements and body positions, the evaluation of their
   level of risk exposure was determined using the Ergo Fellow software,
   specifically with five packages within this program (Rapid Upper Limb
   Assessment, Rapid Entire Body Assessment, Ovako working posture analysis

Abstract = {{Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, aviation at the global level is currently
   facing one of the biggest challenges in its sustainability. The entire
   philosophy related to airport operations and passenger processing
   changes due to the fast-spreading nature of this disease. The ``new
   normal{''} in the aviation sector, primarily at the airport, will
   provide the passenger a different quality level of service in comparison
   to what we used to have until now. Following World Health Organization
   measures, especially those related to social distances, the future focus
   will be on the implementation of fully automated self-service passenger
   traffic flows that will change the airport passenger traffic flows'
   processing structure. This paper shows current technologies and
   processes and how this ``new normal{''} will change philosophy related
   to Industry 4.0 at the airport passenger operations, functionality, and
   human resource (HR) planning and optimizations.}},

   weather due to climate change}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Intensification of arable crop production degrades soil health and
   production potential through loss of soil organic carbon. This,
   potentially, reduces agriculture's resilience to climate change and thus
   food security. Furthermore, the expected increase in frequency of
   adverse and extreme weather events due to climate change are likely to
   affect crop yields differently, depending on when in the growing season
   they occur. We show that soil carbon provides farmers with a natural
   insurance against climate change through a gain in yield stability and
   more resilient production. To do this, we combined yield observations
   from 12 sites and 54 years of Swedish long-term agricultural experiments
   with historical weather data. To account for heterogenous climate
   effects, we partitioned the growing season into four representative
   phases for two major cereal crops. Thereby, we provide evidence that
   higher soil carbon increases yield gains from favourable conditions and
   reduces yield losses due to adverse weather events and how this occurs
   over different stages of the growing season. However, agricultural
   management practices that restore the soil carbon stock, thus
   contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, usually come
   at the cost of foregone yield for the farmer in the short term. To halt
   soil degradation and make arable crop production more resilient to
   climate change, we need agricultural policies that address the public
   benefits of soil conservation and restoration.}},

Abstract = {{The better understanding of the clinically important behavioral features
   of new instrument systems has an important significance for the clinical
   endodontics. This study aimed to investigate the shaping and centering
   ability as well as cyclic fatigue resistance of HyFlex CM (CM), HyFlex
   EDM (EDM) and EdgeFile (EF) thermally treated nickel-titanium (NiTi)
   endodontic instrument systems. Sixty curved root canals of the mesial
   roots of mandibular molars were randomly assigned into three groups (n =
   20) and shaped using CM, EDM and EF files up to the size 40 and taper 04
   of the instruments. mu CT scanning of the specimens before and after
   preparation was performed and the morphometric 2D and 3D parameters were
   evaluated in the apical, middle and coronal thirds of root canals. In
   each group, 40.04 instruments (n = 20) were subjected to the cyclic
   fatigue resistance test in artificial root canals at 37 degrees C
   temperature until fractures occurred, and the number of cycles to
   failure (NCF) was calculated. The fractographic analysis was performed
   using a scanning electron microscope, evaluating topographic features
   and surface profiles of the separated instruments. The one-way analysis
   of variance with post hoc Tuckey's test was used for statistical
   analysis of the data; the significance level was set at 5\%. All systems
   prepared the comparable percentage of root canal surface with the
   similar magnitude of canal transportation in all root thirds (p > 0.05),
   but demonstrated significantly different resistance to cyclic fatigue (p
   < 0.05). The most resistant to fracture was EF, followed by EDM and CM.
   The length of the fractured fragments was not significantly different
   between the groups, and fractographic analysis by SEM detected the
   typical topographic features of separated thermally treated NiTi
   instrument surfaces.}},

Title = {{Reclaiming On-Site Upgrading as a Viable Resilience Strategy-Viabilities
   and Scenarios through the Lens of Disaster-Prone Informal Settlements in
   Metro Manila}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Philippines is argued as the only Southeast Asian country where
   informal settlers' communities have been self-organized and produced
   discernible impacts on the country's urban policies. As one of the high
   risk countries, fifty percent of the country's informal settlements are
   located in danger and disaster-prone areas. However, informal settlement
   upgrading has not reached its significance in disaster mitigation and
   community resilience building. At the national level, on-site upgrading
   is not established in disaster risk management or climate change
   adaptation strategies, which explains the lack of strategic approaches
   for local implementation. Metro Manila serves as a suitable backdrop in
   this sense to study informal settlement upgrading under the condition of
   high risk and rapid urbanization with a high civil society engagement.
   This study investigates the underlined reasons why upgrading
   strategically falls short in addressing disaster mitigation and
   community resilience building. Theoretically, it questions what on-site
   upgrading is about. Empirically, two hazard-prone informal settlement
   communities within Metro Manila are examined with their different risk
   profiles, community development needs and resilience priorities. The
   core issues of upgrading are, therefore, differentiated at the
   settlement level with communities' innate socio-economic and eco-spatial
   features over time. Meanwhile, the paper heightens the necessity of
   tackling on-site upgrading at the settlement level and articulating
   settlements' spatial correlations with the city development, so as to
   sustain upgrading outcomes. In addition, this study attempts at setting
   up a range of scenarios conditioned with COVID pandemic fallout. It
   endeavors to provide another facet of how to deal with adaptation and
   resilience. This includes the urgent strategy shift in the housing
   sector and its financial sustainability, innovative mechanisms to manage
   uncertainty and risks, lessons for post-COVID planning, etc.}},

Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1333-1346}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: The nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)
   family was first recognised to play an important role in the
   differentiation of T cells, but has since been shown to regulate
   multiple pathophysiological processes. However, whether it is involved
   in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains
   unknown.
   Methods: Hepatic NFATc expression and localisation were analysed in
   C57BL/6 mice on a methionine-choline-deficient diet, as well as in
   samples from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients. Gain- or
   loss-of-function approaches were used to investigate the role of NFATc4
   in NASH.
   Results: NFATc4 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in
   hepatocytes of both humans and rodents with NASH. NFATc4 knockdown
   resulted in decreased hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis
   during NASH progression. Mechanistically, we found that activated NFATc4
   directly bound to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa)
   in the nucleus and negatively regulated its transcriptional activity,
   thereby impairing the hepatic fatty acid oxidation pathway and
   increasing lipid deposition in the liver. Moreover, NFATc4 activation
   increased the production and secretion of osteopontin (OPN) from
   hepatocytes, which subsequently enhanced the macrophage-mediated
   inflammatory response and hepatic stellate cell-mediated fibrosis
   progression via paracrine signalling.
   Conclusions: Hepatic NFATc4 activation accelerates the progression of
   NASH by suppressing PPARa signalling and increasing OPN expression.
   Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of NFATc4 may have potential for
   future therapy of NASH.
   Lay summary: NFATc4 is activated in the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis of
   mice and patients. Inhibition of NFATc4 activation alleviates lipid
   deposition, inflammatory response, and fibrosis progression in the
   liver. (C) 2020 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

   supercritical CO2 recompression cycle}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{369}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The off-design behavior of sCO(2) recompression cycle caused by
   adjusting the CO2 flow to meet the production remains to be one of the
   most concerned problems. In this paper, a thermodynamic model of sCO(2)
   recompression cycle based on sodium-cooled fast reactor was established.
   And the sensitivity analysis of inlet conditions at turbomachinery and
   cycle pressure ratio (PR) was conducted in combination with the flow
   split ratio (FSR). Based on the highest cycle efficiency, the
   performance analysis of the main compressor was performed by employing a
   similar method, which was extended to the system with the aim of
   investigating the off-design behavior. The sensitivity analysis results
   indicate that enlarging p1 can reduce the sensitivity of T1, and when
   the compressor inlet fluid approaches the critical state (304.12 K 7.38
   MPa), the cycle efficiency reaches maximum at FSR = 0.31 and PR = 2.9.
   Then the off-design performance of the system in the case of flow
   adjustment is successfully predicted, during which excessive flow is
   found to reduce the output power of the system and lead to a maximum
   efficiency difference of about 13\%. Also observe that the efficiency of
   the re-compressor in single-stage recompression mode is significantly
   lower than that of the main compressor and turbine. Finally, the
   mechanism of two-stage recompression to improve the compactness and
   off-design performance of the system is clarified and the applicability
   of the two-stage turbine without intermediate reheat is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The optimal treatment for EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma
   (LUAD) remains challenging because of intratumor heterogeneity. We aimed
   to explore a refined stratification model based on the integrated
   analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tracking.
   Methods: ctDNA was prospectively collected at baseline and at every 8
   weeks in patients with advanced treatmentnaive EGFR-mutant LUAD under
   gefitinib treatment enrolled in a phase 2 trial and analyzed using
   next-generation sequencing of a 168-gene panel.
   Results: Three subgroups categorized by baseline
   comutations-EGFR-sensitizing mutations (59, 32.8\%), EGFRsensitizing
   mutations with tumor suppressor mutations (97, 53.9\%), and
   EGFR-sensitizing mutations with other driver mutations (24,
   13.3\%)-exhibited distinct progression-free survival (13.2 {[}11.3-15.2]
   versus 9.3 {[}7.6-10.5] versus 4.0 {[}2.4-9.3] months) and overall
   survival (32.0 {[}29.2-41.5] versus 21.7 {[}19.3-27.0] versus 15.5
   {[}10.5-33.7] months, respectively), providing evidence for initial
   stratification. A total of 63.7\% of the patients achieved week 8 ctDNA
   clearance, with significant difference noted among the three subgroups
   (74.5\% versus 64.0\% versus 29.4\%, respectively, p = 0.004, Fisher's
   exact test). Patients without week 8 ctDNA clearance had worse
   progression-free survival (clearance versus nonclearance 11.2
   {[}9.9-13.2] versus 7.4 {[}5.6-9.6] months, p = 0.016, Cox regression],
   especially in the second subgroup {[}5.8 (5.6-11.5) months], suggesting
   the necessity of adaptive stratification during treatment. During
   follow-up, 56.0\% and 20.8\% of the patients eventually harbored p.T790M
   and non-p.T790M mutations, respectively, with a significant difference
   in non-p.T790M mutations among the three subgroups (7.5\% versus 15.7\%
   versus 80.0\%, respectively, p < 0.001, Fisher's exact test), giving
   clues to postline treatment.
   Conclusions: The patients with baseline comutations and ctDNA
   nonclearance at first visit might require combined therapy because of
   the limited survival benefit of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
   monotherapy. We proposed a refined stratification mode for the
   whole-course management of EGFR-mutant LUAD. (C) 2020 Published by

Abstract = {{Decarbonizing the energy system is a major challenge facing the richest
   countries, whereas provision of energy services is a major challenge
   facing the poorest countries. What would be the climate consequences if
   only richer countries focus on decarbonization, and only poorer
   countries focus on provision of energy services? To address this
   question, we create future scenarios in which carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions increase according to a historical trend and then start to
   decline only when countries reach specified income levels. In our
   central case, we assume that when countries start to decarbonize, they
   reduce emissions at 2\% yr(-1). With this assumption and if all
   countries begin to decarbonize in 2020, the world would be expected to
   warm by 2.0 degrees C relative to pre-industrial times. If countries
   begin to decarbonize only when their per capita gross domestic product
   (GDP) exceeds \$10 000, there would be less than 0.3 degrees C of
   additional warming. Yet over half the world's population currently lives
   in countries below such an income threshold, and continued direct CO2
   emissions by people who live in these countries, while they remain
   underdeveloped, would increase global average temperature rise by 14\%
   relative to the case, in which all people begin to decarbonize in 2020.
   The primary concern of developments driven by fossil fuels in lower
   income countries might relate to issues such as the technological
   lock-in to high-emission technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) encompasses a broad range of
   symptoms and is normally considered a heterogeneous disorder. Sometimes,
   OCD seems to be psychotic in nature, being complex in the
   differentiation between OCD and schizophrenia. This report describes a
   female adult patient who was diagnosed in her adolescence with
   schizophrenia due to her complains of ``hearing voices ``criticizing
   her. In response to team request for a second evaluation, she was
   admitted to the acute inpatient service. After a careful reassessment,
   the core symptom was recognized as obsession, and her diagnosis was
   revised to OCD; this allowed for a more direct treatment and management,
   with cognitive-behavior therapy and high doses of selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitors, achieving a sustained clinical improvement over 2
   years of follow-up. Currently, she is more functional, participates in
   social activities, and totally recognizes the egodystonic and intrusive
   thoughts. This case demonstrates the importance of eliciting
   psychopathology in greater detail for specific diagnosis and treatment
   decisions, especially in a complex clinical presentation.}},

Journal = {{NPJ MICROGRAVITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Modifications of gravity levels induce generalized adaptation of
   mammalian physiology, including vascular, brain, muscle, bone and
   immunity functions. As a crucial interface between the vascular system
   and the brain, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) acts as a filter to protect
   neurons from pathogens and inflammation. Here we compare the effects of
   several protocols of hypergravity induced by centrifugation and
   whole-body vibrations (WBV) on BBB integrity. The immunohistochemistry
   revealed immunoglobulin G (IgG) extravasation from blood to hippocampal
   parenchyma of mice centrifuged at 2 x g during 1 or 50 days, whereas
   short exposures to higher hypergravity mimicking the profiles of
   spaceflight landing and take-off (short exposures to 5 x g) had no
   effects. These results suggest prolonged centrifugation (>1 days) at 2 x
   g induced a BBB leakage. Moreover, WBV were similarly tested. The short
   exposure to +2 x g vibrations (900 s/day at 90 Hz) repeated for 63 days
   induced IgG extravasation in hippocampal parenchyma, whereas the
   progressive increase of vibrations from +0.5 to +2 x g for 63 days was
   not able to affect the IgG crossing through the BBB. Overall, these
   results suggest that the BBB permeability is sensitive to prolonged
   external accelerations. In conclusion, we advise that the protocols of
   WBV and centrifugation, proposed as countermeasure to spaceflight,
   should be designed with progressively increasing exposure to reduce
   potential side effects on the BBB.}},

Abstract = {{Moral purism is a commonly held view on moral worthiness and how to
   identify it in concrete cases. Moral purists long for a moral world in
   which (business) people-at least sometimes-act morally worthy, but in
   concrete cases they systematically discount good deeds as grounded in
   self-interest. Moral purism evokes moral cynicism. Moral cynicism is a
   problem, both in society at large and the business world. Moral cynicism
   can be fought by refuting moral purism. This article takes issue with
   moral purism. The common strategy to tackle moral purism is to reject
   the exclusion thesis which states that self-interest and the `pure'
   moral motive (and thus moral worthiness) exclude each other. We develop
   a different strategy. We argue that moral purists are mistaken in the
   way they judge moral worthiness in concrete cases. They employ the wrong
   procedure and the wrong criteria. We develop a proper procedure and
   proper criteria. We build on Kant, who we argue is unfairly regarded as
   the champion of moral purism. In order to see how Kant can develop a
   consistent (non-purist) philosophy, the exclusion thesis must be
   embedded in Kant's transcendental philosophy. Properly embedded, Kant
   turns out to be both anti-purist and anti-cynical.}},

   with reduced voltage stress across the boost-buck converter switches
   under a desired voltage gain and system efficiency. The ZDC (Zero Direct
   Current) based vector-oriented control is employed for the VSI (Voltage
   Source Inverter) for speed control of non-salient pole PMSM drive. A DSC
   (Digital Signal Controller) dSPACE 1104 is used for real time
   validation. Simulation results are obtained to validate the performance
   of proposed control algorithms and test results are obtained with a
   rooftop solar PV panel.}},

Abstract = {{Often, in the search for a highly defined scientific phenomenon, a
   different one becomes apparent. This was also the case of this work, in
   the scope of which we planned to search for metal-enhanced, novel
   antibacterial/ antifungal compounds. Instead, we denied the existence of
   such and revealed the details of the bioinorganic chemistry of
   Zn(II)-alloferon complexes. Zinc(II) complexes of alloferon 1 and 2,
   ligands with a sequential difference of one amino acid only, show a
   substantially different coordination pattern at physiological pH. In the
   case of Zn(II)-alloferon 1 species, a histamine-like binding mode is
   observed (N-terminal amine and imidazole of His-1) and the coordination
   sphere is completed with the imidazole nitrogens of His-6 and His-9;
   His-12 is not involved in binding. In the case of Zn(II)-alloferon 2,
   the N-terminal amine and all the three imidazoles present in the
   sequence participate in the coordination, however, with the chemical
   shift of His-5 being less affected than those of other imidazoles. The
   histamine-like binding in Zn(II)-alloferon 1 complex strongly enhances
   its thermodynamic stability in comparison to the His-1 lacking alloferon
   2 analogue. Despite previous reports on the antibacterial and antifungal
   activity of alloferon 1, no such activity was detected, neither for
   alloferon 1 and 2 nor for their Zn(II) complexes.}},

Title = {{Safety Surveillance of Bivalent Meningococcal Group B Vaccine, Vaccine

Abstract = {{Background In October 2014, MenB-FHbp (Trumenba, Pfizer) became the
   first meningococcal group B vaccine licensed in the United States. It is
   approved for use in individuals aged 10-25 years. Our objective was to
   evaluate the safety of MenB-FHbp postlicensure.
   Methods. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a
   national passive vaccine safety surveillance system. We analyzed US
   VAERS reports for MenB-FHbp received from the date of licensure in
   October 2014 through December 2018. We described the characteristics of
   the persons and adverse events (AEs) reported and calculated reporting
   rates using the number of doses distributed. We used empirical Bayesian
   data mining to identify AEs reported at least twice as often as expected
   compared with all other vaccines.
   Results. VAERS received 2106 reports involving MenB-FHbp, representing
   698 reports per million doses distributed. The median age of vaccinees
   was 17 years, and 55\% were female. MenB-FHbp was given simultaneously
   with other vaccines in 37\% of reports. Most reports (57\%) described
   AEs that started on the day of or day after vaccination. The most common
   AEs reported were pyrexia (27\%), headache (25\%), and pain (16\%).
   There were 44 serious reports (2\% of all reports), among which 42
   reported a hospitalization. Data mining identified disproportional
   reporting of headache, pyrexia, chills, and myalgia.
   Conclusions. The AEs most commonly or disproportionately reported
   following MenB-FHbp were consistent with those identified in clinical
   trials as described in the US package insert. We did not identify any
   new safety issues.}},

Abstract = {{The archaeological sites in the Lovas municipality have been known to
   the wider archaeological public for quite some time, especially due to
   the discovery of a hoard, in the middle of the 20th century, that
   contained gold and bronze finds. Today, the said hoard is a part of the
   permanent exhibition of the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb. On three
   occasions, in 2011, 2017 and 2018, the Museum conducted archaeological
   research in the Lovas municipality. During these research seasons, a
   systematic field survey was conducted, and test trenches were excavated
   at various positions, with the aim of determining the state of
   preservation of documented archaeological layers. This paper includes
   what is known, to this point, about the archaeological topography of the
   Lovas municipality, and which has been significantly expanded by the

Abstract = {{In this study we investigated antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella
   pneumoniae and the phagocytic functions of human leukocyte cells as
   revealed in an in vitro experimental model combining cefepime and
   gentamicin with Pelargonium endlicherianum Fenzl. essential oil
   treatments. The bactericidal effects of this essential oil and
   antibiotic combinations were dynamically detected by time-kill assay. To
   examine the function of this essential oil and antibiotics in permeating
   outer membrane barriers when used singly or in combination, a UV
   spectrophotometer was used, and morphologic images were captured by
   scanning electron microscopy.
   The antibacterial activity of the essential oil and antibiotics was
   assessed using broth microdilution and agar well diffusion. The combined
   effects of the essential oils of P. endlicherianum and gentamicin and
   cefepime were evaluated by means of the checkerboard method against K.
   pneumoniae. In the assays, fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC)
   values were calculated to characterize the interactions between the
   combinations. In the combinations of essential oil and antibiotics, the
   sensitivity of the bacteria to antibiotics increased and the antibiotics
   had a synergistic effect, and the antibacterial effect on the
   microorganisms increased. The cefepime + essential oil pair tested
   showed a synergistic effect (FIC <= 0.5), but the gentamicin + essential
   oil pair did not (FIC > 0.5-4.0). Thus, the cefepime + essential oil
   pair has been found to exhibit a synergistic effect against K.
   pneumoniae compared to the gentamicin + essential oil pair. According to
   the results obtained here, the combined use of essential oils with
   antibiotics can be applied as a treatment strategy to reduce the use of
   antibiotics, reduce side effects, and possibly reverse antibiotic
   resistance to these microorganisms in light of the increase in multiple
   antibiotic resistance. (c) 2020 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Dengue is a major health concern causing significant mortality,
   morbidity and economic loss. The development of anti-dengue viral drugs
   is challenging due to high toxicity, as well as off-target/side effects.
   We engineered size tuned ZnS QDs as a platform for the efficient
   delivery of mycophenolic acid (MPA) against dengue virus serotype 2
   (DENV2) to evaluate the drug efficacy and toxicity using the DENV2
   sub-genomic replicon system in BHK21 cells. The results indicate that
   the Selectivity Index 50 (SI50) of the ZnS QD-MPA conjugate was two
   orders higher than that of free MPA with lower cytotoxicity. The effect
   is attributed to the sustained release of MPA from ZnS QD-MPA. The
   conjugated MPA caused significant inhibition of the virus at the level
   of replication and viral protein translation. The study underpins the
   efficiency of the ZnS QD for the delivery of antiviral drugs against
   DENV2 with negligible toxicity and side effects.}},

Abstract = {{The progressing digitisation of European and global agriculture requires
   a rational approach to the reliability of agricultural machinery and
   vehicles. It is not easy to access data on failures of their parts,
   units and systems, which are necessary for classic characterisation of
   reliability. For this reason, it is necessary to develop other
   unconventional methods of acquiring information about the technical
   condition of machinery and convert it into a numerical form. This study
   presents an original method of quantifying the relative index of
   reliability of farm tractors based on their owners' subjective opinions.
   At present the rankings obtained by means of this method are the only
   tool supporting purchase decisions in situations of uncertainty and
   risk. Polish farmers found Valtra tractors to be the most reliable. The
   average reliability index is 0.87. Among 12 brands in the ranking the
   users rated 11 specific reliability criteria of Valtra tractors the
   highest. The runner-up was John Deere-a global manufacturer of
   agricultural machinery and vehicles. The German brand Fendt was the
   third in the ranking.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Complex coronary lesions are more prone to complications; however, the
   relationship between complex coronary lesions and no-reflow phenomenon
   in patients undergoing primary percutaneous intervention (pPCI) is still
   not clarified. Previous studies reported the association of total
   coronary artery complexity with no-reflow; however, impact of culprit
   lesion complexity on no-reflow is not known. In this study, we aimed to
   investigate the impact of culprit lesion complexity on no-reflow
   phenomenon. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the factors that are
   related to reversibility of no-reflow.
   Methods
   We prospectively included 424 patients treated with pPCI. Patients'
   baseline characteristics and clinical variables were recorded.
   Reversibility of no-reflow was decided according to final angiography or
   ST resolution during the first hour following pPCI. There were 90
   patients with a diagnosis of no-reflow constituted group 1 and patients
   without no-reflow constituted group 2. Complexity of coronary artery
   disease was assessed with SYNTAX score and culprit lesion complexity was
   assessed with both American College of Cardiology/Society of
   Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions lesion classification and
   SYNTAX score.
   Results
   Complexity of culprit lesion was significantly higher in group 1
   patients (type C lesion 76.6 vs. 27.8\%; P < 0.001 and SYNTAX score 8.7
   +/- 3.0 vs. 6.2 +/- 2.6; P < 0.001, respectively, group 1 vs. 2).
   Multivariate analyses revealed that lesion complexity is independently
   associated with no-reflow. Among 90 patients of group 1, 43 patients
   were classified as reversible no-reflow. Logistic regression analysis
   revealed that only ischaemia duration is independently associated with
   reversibility of no-reflow.
   Conclusion
   Our study demonstrated that culprit lesion complexity is independently
   associated with no-reflow phenomenon and short ischaemic duration is
   significantly associated with reversibility of no-reflow.}},

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Multilamellar bodies (MLBs), structures composed of concentric membrane
   layers, are known to be produced by different protozoa, including
   species of ciliates, free-living amoebae, and Dictyostelium discoideum
   social amoebae. Initially believed to be metabolic waste, potential
   roles like cell communication and food storage have been suggested for
   D. discoideum MLBs, which could be useful for the multicellular
   development of social amoebae and as a food source. However, among
   dictyostelids, this phenomenon has only been observed with D.
   discoideum, and mainly with laboratory strains grown in axenic
   conditions. It was thought that other social amoebae may also produce
   MLBs. Four environmental social amoeba isolates were characterized. All
   strains belong to the Dictyostelium genus, including some likely to be
   Dictyostelium giganteum. They have distinctive phenotypes comprising
   their growth rate on Klebsiella aerogenes lawns and the morphology of
   their fruiting bodies. They all produce MLBs like those produced by a D.
   discoideum laboratory strain when grown on K. aerogenes lawns, as
   revealed by analysis using the H36 antibody in epifluorescence
   microscopy as well as by transmission electron microscopy. Consequently,
   this study shows that MLBs are produced by various dictyostelid species,
   which further supports a role for MLBs in the lifestyle of amoebae.}},

Title = {{Expression interference of a number of Heterodera avenae conserved genes
   perturbs nematode parasitic success in Triticum aestivum}},
Journal = {{PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{301}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The cereal cyst nematode, Heterodera avenae is distributed worldwide and
   causes substantial damage in bread wheat, Triticum aestivum. This
   nematode is extremely difficult to manage because of its prolonged
   persistence as unhatched eggs encased in cysts. Due to its sustainable
   and target-specific nature, RNA interference (RNAi)-based strategy has
   gained unprecedented importance for pest control. To date, RNAi strategy
   has not been exploited to manage H. avenae in wheat. In the present
   study, 40 H. avenae target genes with different molecular function were
   rationally selected for in vitro soaking analysis in order to assess
   their susceptibility to RNAi. In contrast to target-specific
   downregulation of 18 genes, 7 genes were upregulated and 15 genes showed
   unaltered expression (although combinatorial soaking showed some of
   these genes are RNAi susceptible), suggesting that a few of the target
   genes were refractory or recalcitrant to RNAi. However, RNAi of 37 of
   these genes negatively altered nematode behavior in terms of reduced
   penetration, development and reproduction in wheat. Subsequently, wheat
   plants were transformed with seven H. avenae target genes (that showed
   greatest abrogation of nematode parasitic success) for host-induced gene
   silencing (HIGS) analysis. Transformed plants were molecularly
   char-acterized by PCR, RT-qPCR and Southern hybridization. Production of
   target gene-specific doubleand single stranded RNA (dsRNA/siRNA) was
   detected in transformed plants. Transgenic expression of galectin,
   cathepsin L, vap1, serpin, flp12, RanBPM and chitinase genes conferred
   33.24-72.4 \% reduction in H. avenae multiplication in T1 events with
   single copy ones exhibiting greatest reduction. A similar degree of
   resistance observed in T2 plants indicated the consistent HIGS effect in
   the subsequent generations. Intriguingly, cysts isolated from RNAi
   plants were of smaller size with translucent cuticle compared to normal
   size, dark brown control cysts, suggesting H. avenae developmental
   retardation due to HIGS. Our study reinforces the potential of HIGS to
   manage nematode problems in crop plant.}},

Abstract = {{Field traffic is the main cause of soil compacting, especially on the
   topsoil, and its effect may extend to the subsoil, which reduces the
   biological activity of the soil and plants. In order to evaluate changes
   in soil structure, this study was conducted in silty clay loam soil
   (Typic Torrifluvents) plowed to a depth of 20 cm under the effects of
   tractor passes (without Passes (C-0), once passes (C-1), twice passes
   (C-2) and four-times passes (C-4) on the same track) and for three soil
   depth ranges, (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm). Soil structural properties,
   bulk density, total porosity, air-filled porosity, and soil penetration
   resistance are used as indicators to assess changes in soil structure
   due to compaction. The passes treatments were conducted at optimum
   moisture content for the compaction. The results indicated that with the
   increase in the number of passes, the average values of bulk density and
   penetration resistance increased until it reached its highest value of
   1.51 Mg m(-3) and 1.843 MPa, respectively, and this was accompanied by
   the highest decrease in the values of total porosity 43.020\% and the
   air-filled porosity 5.24\% were occurred at the effect of the passes
   repetition treatment was four times. The same effect also occurred for
   soil depth in the mentioned traits. The highest value of apparent
   density was 1.47 Mg m(-3), the penetration resistance was 1.632 MPa, the
   highest decrease in the total porosity value is 44.528\% and the
   air-filled porosity was 6.20\%, were found at the depth 20-30 cm. The
   results showed that the one-time passes treatment achieved the highest
   percentage of change in the values of the study indicators for all depth
   ranges. The highest soil compaction rate was observed within the depth
   range of 10-20 cm for all passes treatments based on the percentages of
   change in the studied traits except for penetration resistance. The
   depth of the effective compaction reached the soil within the depth
   range of 20-30 cm when dealing with one-time pass treatment and its
   amount increased with the passes sequence. The results also showed that
   the values of bulk density and total porosity exceeded the critical
   value under the influence of the passes treatment twice at the depths of
   10-20 and 20-30 cm and the passes treatment four times for all ranges of
   soil depth. While the air-filled porosity and penetration resistance
   overtaken the critical limits under the influence of the one-time passes
   treatment at the depths of 10-20 and 20-30 cm, and the passes treatments
   twice and four times for all ranges of soil depth. The studied soil
   seems to be very sensitive to compaction, has a weak structure, and less
   organic matter content, so it needs an efficient management system to
   avoid the risk of compaction.}},

Abstract = {{Carter and Pritchard (Philos Stud 173(4):969-990, 2016) and Pritchard
   (Nous 44(2):245-268, 2010, Epistemological disjunctivism, Oxford
   University Press, Oxford, 2012, Epistemic angst: radical scepticism and
   the groundlessness of our believing, Princeton University Press,
   Princeton, 2016) have tried to reconcile the intuition that perceptual
   knowledge requires only limited discriminatory abilities with the
   closure principle. To this end, they have introduced two theoretical
   innovations: a contrast between two ways of introducing
   error-possibilities and a distinction between discriminating and
   favoring evidence. I argue that their solution faces the ``sufficiency
   problem{''}: it is unclear whether the evidence that is normally
   available to adult humans is sufficient to retain knowledge of the
   entailing proposition and come to know the entailed proposition. I
   submit that, on either infallibilist or fallibilist views of evidence,
   Carter and Pritchard have set the bar for deductive knowledge too low.
   At the end, I offer an alternative solution. I suggest that the
   knowledge-retention condition of the closure principle is not satisfied
   in zebra-like scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Background It is thought that heart failure (HF) patients may benefit
   from the evaluation of mechanical (dys)synchrony, and an independent
   inverse relationship between myocardial perfusion and ventricular
   synchrony has been suggested. We explore the relationship between
   quantitative myocardial perfusion and synchrony parameters when
   accounting for the presence and extent of fixed perfusion defects in
   patients with chronic HF. Methods We studied 98 patients with chronic HF
   who underwent rest and stress Nitrogen-13 ammonia PET. Multivariate
   analyses of covariance were performed to determine relevant predictors
   of synchrony (measured as bandwidth, standard deviation, and entropy).
   Results In our population, there were 43 (44\%) women and 55 men with a
   mean age of 71 +/- 9.6 years. The SRS was the strongest independent
   predictor of mechanical synchrony variables (p < .01), among other
   considered predictors including: age, sex, body mass index, smoking,
   diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, rest myocardial blood
   flow (MBF), and myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR). Results were similar
   when considering stress MBF instead of MPR. Conclusions The existence
   and extent of fixed perfusion defects, but not the quantitative PET
   myocardial perfusion parameters (sMBF and MPR), constitute a significant
   independent predictor of ventricular mechanical synchrony in patients
   with chronic HF.}},

Abstract = {{Based on his Inclosure Schema and the Principle of Uniform Solution
   (PUS), Priest has argued that Curry's paradox belongs to a different
   family of paradoxes than the Liar. Pleitz (2015, The Logica Yearbook
   2014, pp. 233-248) argued that Curry's paradox shares the same structure
   as the other paradoxes and proposed a scheme of which the Inclosure
   Schema is a particular case and he criticizes Priest's position by
   pointing out that applying the PUS implies the use of a paraconsistent
   logic that does not validate Contraction, but that this can hardly seen
   as uniform. In this paper, we will develop some further reasons to
   defend Pleitz' thesis that Curry's paradox belongs to the same family as
   the rest of the self-referential paradoxes \& using the idea that
   conditionals are generalized negations. However, we will not follow
   Pleitz in considering doubtful that there is a uniform solution for the
   paradoxes in a paraconsistent spirit. We will argue that the
   paraconsistent strategies can be seen as special cases of the strategy
   of restricting Detachment and that the latter uniformly blocks all the
   connective-involving self-referential paradoxes, including Curry's.}},

Abstract = {{Most mining companies have registered important amounts of drill core
   composite spectra using different acquisition equipment and by following
   diverse protocols. These companies have used classic spectrography based
   on the detection of absorption features to perform semi-quantitative
   mineralogy. This methodology requires ideal laboratory conditions in
   order to obtain normalized spectra to compare. However, the inherent
   variability of spectral features-due to environmental conditions and
   geological context, among others-is unavoidable and needs to be managed.
   This work presents a novel methodology for geometallurgical sample
   characterization consisting of a heterogeneous, multi-pixel processing
   pipeline which addresses the effects of ambient conditions and
   geological context variability to estimate critical geological and
   geometallurgical variables. It relies on the assumptions that the
   acquisition of hyperspectral images is an inherently stochastic process
   and that ore sample information is deployed in the whole spectrum. The
   proposed framework is basically composed of: (a) a new hyperspectral
   image segmentation algorithm, (b) a preserving-information
   dimensionality reduction scheme and (c) a stochastic hierarchical
   regression model. A set of experiments considering white reference
   spectral characterization and geometallurgical variable estimation is
   presented to show promising results for the proposed approach.}},

   effluent was exposed to ozone at 250 mgO(3)/h fixed dose and contact
   time 1 to 60-min. The SGBP performance was maximum under 60/30-min
   aeration conditions achieving 92.1, 90.6, 83.3 and 83.8\% reduction in
   COD, BOD5, TN and PO4-P respectively. Nitrification (64.1\%) was
   uninhibited even on transition to pulse aeration cycles. The
   concentrations of diesel oil and methylene blue dye were reduced by 83.6
   and 93.5\% respectively. Post-ozonation oxidized residual organics up to
   19.9\%, based on COD measurement, and increased effluent BOD5 up to

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dynamics of thin-shell wormholes within the context of f (R) gravity by
   joining two identical copies of Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter manifold
   using the cut and paste approach is discussed. The stability of
   wormholes is analyzed through the radial perturbation about the static
   solution and the modified generalized Chaplygin gas equation of state
   (EoS). This formalism gives rise two specific different configurations
   of f (R) gravity, in which quadratic type model and cubic type model.
   The presence of both stable and unstable regions depending on the
   appropriate values of different parameters are examined their EoS, with
   taken into account severalf (R)gravity models as well as the metric
   space are illustrated.
   Also, the stability regions under the radial perturbation depend on the
   EoS parameter beta(2) usually is explained as the subluminal square
   speed of sound exist. Such a region of stability in the existence of a
   large value of the charge is significantly is increased and extended by
   decreasing the value of the cosmological constant The effect of
   increasing dark sources delta and alpha parameters leads to an increase
   in the stable regions is displayed. Stability regions increase for
   increasing EoS parameters gamma, sigma, eta and also the influence of
   the curvature parameter R may increase the stability regions. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Frontline neurointensive care nurses from 1 community
   hospital were invited to assess the current state of care related to use
   of external ventricular drains (EVDs) and intrahospital transport (IHT)
   policies, investigate and plan practice changes, and implement skills
   review for nurses caring for the adult patient with an acute brain
   injury. PROJECT: Our team researched best practices related to EVD care
   and IHT procedures, updated current EVD insertion checklists, developed
   nurse role cards to assist with EVD insertion at the bedside, revised
   current EVD care policies and procedures, and created a new IHT policy.
   The same nurses shared updated information and skills review for
   neuroscience nurse peers. CONCLUSION: The goals for the project were
   met, and practice variation is being reduced.}},

Title = {{Environmental impacts on walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus)
   distribution across the Bering Sea shelf}},
Journal = {{DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{181}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Adult and juvenile (age-1) walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) were
   sampled by the US NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center summer bottom
   trawl survey in 2010, 2017, 2018, and 2019 in the northeastern and
   southeastern Bering Sea, with profiles of temperature collected
   concurrently. Similarly, the Russian Research Institute of Fisheries and
   Oceanography, Pacific branch, collected adult and juvenile pollock and
   temperature profiles on summer bottom trawl surveys in the northwestern
   Bering Sea. Results from these surveys show that adult pollock abundance
   in recent years (2017, 2018, 2019) has increased in northern regions of
   the Bering Sea shelf in both the US and Russian sectors. Lower
   abundances, compared to historic means, were observed in southern
   regions of the shelf, suggesting the pollock moved directionally from
   the south to the north. We relate changes in pollock distribution in
   recent intermediate (2017) and warm, low-ice years (2018-2019) to a
   prior cold, high-ice year (2010) and describe how these observations
   relate to our longer time series. We link temperature data from bottom
   trawl surveys (US and Russian), sea-ice indices (retreat timing and
   extent), as well as model-based estimates of ocean circulation to
   changes in pollock distribution and examine potential environmental
   factors driving the observed changes. Changes in sea-ice and bottom
   temperature (e.g., reductions in ice extent and shrinking of the cold
   pool), and changes in circulation (stronger northward currents over the
   northeastern shelf in warmer years, particularly in 2018) led to changes
   in distributions of adult and age-1 pollock. Adult pollock were
   concentrated north of St. Lawrence Island and had larger longitudinal
   distributions in warm years, 2017-2019; whereas they had a more
   southerly and narrow distribution over the outer shelf in the cold year,
   2010. Age-1 pollock had higher densities over the inner eastern shelf in
   2017-2019 compared to 2010. Northward flow around St. Lawrence Island
   (particularly in the spring) alternated between stronger flow on the
   west side of the island in 2010 and 2017 and stronger flow on the east
   side of the island in 2018 and 2019; variations in flow may have
   impacted the location of prey and movement of feeding pollock to the
   Chukchi Sea. Size structure comparisons between NW, NE and SE sections
   of the Bering Sea shelf suggest that movement of fish between US and
   Russian waters may have been highest in 2019, one of the two warmest
   years, and lowest in 2010, the coldest year. Spatial comparisons of
   distributions and size structure across the Bering Sea help provide a
   comprehensive view of factors affecting the movement of this highly
   important commercial fish species.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decades, sustainability and corporate sustainability have
   gained a lot of attention. Currently, the focus of attention has shifted
   to the integration of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into
   businesses operation. The extant literature points to the proposed
   frameworks as not fitting micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises
   (MSME) reality and, also, to a lack of empirical evidence in this field.
   With research at the intersection of business and SDGs still being
   scarce, the Economy for the Common Good (ECG) model allows
   operationalizing the SDGs employing its novel measurement theory. The
   present study is aimed at completing the statistical validation process
   of the ECG measurement theory using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
   on a sample of 206 European firms. Thus, after having performed an
   exploratory factor analysis (EFA), this study takes as a starting point
   the previously published knowledge and proceeds with the second step of
   the statistical validation process. The results of CFA confirm the
   conclusions of the EFA and allow to redefine the measurement scales
   included in the ECG framework to achieve a sufficient level of goodness
   of fit.}},

Title = {{Development of a Capacitance versus Voltage Model for Lithium-Ion
   Capacitors}},
Journal = {{BATTERIES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The capacitance of Lithium-ion Capacitors (LiCs) highly depends on their
   terminal voltage. Previous research found that it varies in a nonlinear
   manner with respect to the voltage. However, none of them modeled the
   capacitance evolution while considering the physicochemical phenomena
   that happen in a LiC cell. This paper focuses on developing a new
   capacitance model that is based on the Stern model of the
   electrochemical double layer capacitance. The model accounts for the
   asymmetric V-shape of the C(V) curve, which reflects the variation of
   the capacitance with respect to the voltage. The novelty of this study
   concerns the development of a model for LiCs that relies on the
   fundamental theory of Stern for the differential capacitance. The basic
   model of Stern is modified in order to account for the hybrid
   physicochemical structure of LiCs. Moreover, the model was applied to
   three aged cells to which accelerated calendar aging tests were applied
   at three voltage values: 2.2, 3 and 3.8 V. A drift of the voltage
   corresponding to the minimum capacitance was detected for the aged
   cells. This voltage is related to the neutral state of the positive
   electrode. The main cause of this phenomenon concerns the loss of
   lithium ions from the negative electrode of a LiC. In addition,
   capacitance values decreased after aging, showing an eventual blocking
   of the pores of the positive electrode. Therefore, the analysis of the
   C(V) curve was found to be an interesting tool for the interpretation of
   aging mechanisms.}},

Journal = {{META GENE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Early diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and
   its activity has a curtail role in the proper management of the disease
   with positive effect on its prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) evidently take
   apart in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Many miRNAs play a
   role in SLE pathogenesis and miR-155 is one of them.
   Objective: To examine miR-155 expression in patients with SLE and
   evaluate its role in the disease development and activity.
   Subjects and methods: The current study evaluated miR-155 expression in
   60 SLE patients and 40 apparently healthy controls (HCs) using real-time
   polymerase chain reaction. Diagnosis was according to Systemic Lupus
   International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria. Disease activity
   was evaluated by systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index
   (SLEDAI-2 K) score.
   Results: miR-155 level was significantly higher in SLE patients than
   controls with significant positive correlation with SLEDAI score and
   positive relation to renal involvement, proteinuria, pulmonary
   complications, fever and dsDNA antibodies. Multivariate regression
   analysis revealed that miR-155 is a significant risk factor for SLE.
   Conclusion: Overexpression of miR-155 occurs in SLE and it can be used
   as a predictor biomarker for disease's development and activity. It also
   may be a risk for renal involvement in the disease course.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Oral cancer (OC) is a neoplastic process of the oral cavity
   that has high mortality and significant effects on patients' aesthetics.
   The majority of OC is oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and resection
   remains the most frequent treatment. Recurrence is the main cause of
   tumor-related mortality.
   Material and methods: A retrospective review of patients' charts at
   Hamad Medical Corporation examined 154 adults who were diagnosed as OSCC
   and referred to the national head and neck cancer multi-disciplinary
   team meetings between 2012 and 2018. The data extracted was demographic,
   pathologic and clinical. All patients with oral cavity tumors other than
   squamous cell carcinoma were excluded.
   Results: Males comprised the majority of the sample, mean age was 46.93
   years. Tongue was the most common location. The majority of the patients
   were diagnosed at early stages, and a small subset of patients had
   histologically-proven local recurrence.
   Conclusion: The young male predominance of OSCC patients in Qatar is
   unprecedented worldwide. Most patients were non-Qataris, mainly from
   South Asia. Loss of follow-up was a challenge in assessing the long-term
   outcomes of OSCC. Our findings suggest the need for a more vigilant
   surveillance approach to oral lesions particularly in male South-Asian
   patients, as well as improving the follow-up strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Risk stratification in patients post-transcatheter aortic
   valve replacement (TAVR) is limited to and is based on clinical judgment
   and surgical scoring systems. Serum natriuretic peptides are used for
   general risk stratification in patients with aortic stenosis, reflecting
   the increase in their afterload and thereby stressing the need for valve
   intervention. The objective of this study was to determine the
   predictive value of pre- and post-procedural serum brain natriuretic
   peptide (BNP) on 1-year all-cause mortality in patients who underwent
   TAVR. Methods: In this population-based study, we included 148 TAVR
   patients treated at the Poriya Medical Center between June 1, 2015, and
   May 31, 2018. Routine blood samples for serum BNP levels (pg/mL) were
   taken just before the TAVR and 24 h post-TAVR. Our primary clinical
   outcome was defined as 1-year all-cause mortality. We used backward
   regression models and included all variables that had a p value Results:
   In this study cohort, BNP levels 24 h post-TAVR higher than the cohort
   median versus lower than the cohort median (387.5 pg/mL; IQR 195-817.6)
   were the strongest predictor of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio 9; 95\%
   CI 2.72-30.16; p < 0.001). The statistically significant relationship
   was seen in the unadjusted regression model as well as after the
   adjustment for clinical variables. Conclusions: Serum BNP levels 24 h
   post-procedure were found to be a meaningful marker in predicting 1-year
   all-cause mortality in patients after TAVR procedure.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Time-based analog-to-digital converter is considered a crucial part in
   the design of software-defined radio receivers for its higher
   performance than other analog-to-digital converters in terms of
   operation speed, input dynamic range and power consumption. In this
   paper, two novel voltage-to-time converters are proposed at which the
   input voltage signal is connected to the body terminal of the starving
   transistor rather than its gate terminal. These novel converters exhibit
   better linearity, which is analytically proven in this paper. The
   maximum linearity error is reduced to 0.4\%. In addition, the input
   dynamic range of these converters is increased to 800 mV for a supply
   voltage of 1.2 V by using industrial hardware-calibrated TSMC 65 nm CMOS
   technology. These novel designs consist of only a single inverter stage,
   which results in reducing the layout area and the power consumption. The
   overall power consumption is 18 mu W for the first proposed circuit and
   15 mu W for the second proposed circuit. The novel converter circuits
   have a resolution of 5 bits and operate at a maximum clock frequency of
   500 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{A novel class-D flipped voltage follower (FVF) low-dropout (LDO)
   regulator is proposed and implemented in this paper to supply high load
   current with fast transient response for sharp load changes. The
   proposed class-D control generates a multi-level pulse width modulated
   (MLPWM) signal to the gate of the control transistor that corresponds to
   the load level. The MLPWM control signal enables wide loop bandwidth and
   reduces output ripple. The FVF architecture reduces the output impedance
   and improves the controller efficiency. A novel feed-forward
   transition-detection path (FFTDP) controls the gate of the power
   transistor and allows enhanced switching at high loads. The proposed LDO
   operates with a wide range of input voltages from 1.2V to 1.8V and
   dropout of 200mV down to 50mV. The implementation responds to load
   changes from 0-300mA in 7ns with no observed overshoot/undershoot. The
   output ripple for the LDO is < 7mV with roughly 2.5mV due to ESR
   resistance. The LDO achieves FOMV = 1mV with a current efficiency of
   99.93\% at maximum load current. The prototype chip is fabricated on
   28-nm CMOS technology and the controller occupies 0.004mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{Lateral pelvic lymph nodes (LPLN) are a major site for local recurrence
   following curative resection for low locally advanced rectal cancer.
   Ongoing advances in imaging techniques have improved predicting LPLN
   metastasis (LPLNM) during pre-operative staging. However, there is
   ongoing debate on optimal management of this subgroup of patients with
   variation between guidance of different societies. In Japan, LPLNM is
   considered as local disease and addressed by lateral pelvic node
   dissection (LPLND) in addition to total mesorectal excision (TME).
   However, in the west, LPLNM is considered as metastatic disease and
   those patients are offered neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed
   by TME surgery. The potential surgical risks and morbidity associated
   with LPLND as well as the uncertainty of the oncological outcome have
   raised the concern that patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer
   with LPLNM could be over or under-treated.
   A comprehensive review of literature was performed, summarizing the
   current evidence on available modalities for predicting LPLNM, the role
   of LPLND in the management of advanced low rectal cancer and the
   available surgical approaches with their impact on surgical and
   oncological outcomes.
   LPLND is associated with increased operative time, blood loss and
   post-operative morbidity. The potential benefits for local disease
   control and survival still awaits high quality studies. There has been
   increasing number of reports of the use minimally invasive approaches in
   LPLND in an attempt to reduce post-operative complications.
   There is need for high quality evidence to define the role of LPLND in
   management of patients with advanced low rectal cancer.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Gadusols are efficient nature UV sunscreens with antioxidant capacity.
   The kinetics of the quenching reactions of singlet oxygen
   O-2((1)Delta(g)) by gadusol species was evaluated in aqueous solution as
   well as in the presence of direct charged micelles. Time-resolved
   phosphorescence detection of O-2((1)Delta(g)) indicated that gadusolate,
   the main species under biological pH, is a more efficient quencher than
   the enol form with a rate constant of ca. 1.3 x 10(8) L mol(-1) s(1).
   The deactivation proceeds via a collisional mechanism with clear
   dominance of chemical pathways, according to the rates of gadusol and
   oxygen consumptions, and typical photooxidation quantum yields of ca.
   7\%. The relative contributions of the chemical and physical quenching
   steps were not affected by the presence of anionic or cationic micelles
   emulating simple pseudo-biological environments. The products of the
   photooxidative quenching support a type II mechanism initiated by the
   addition of O-2((1)Delta(g)) to the C-C double bond of gadusolate. These
   results point to the relevance of considering the role of sacrifice
   antioxidant along with the UV-screening function for gadusol,
   particularly in the context of potential biotechnological applications
   of this natural molecule.}},

Abstract = {{Two inhomogeneous single-fluid models for the Universe, which are able
   to naturally solve the H-0 tension problem, are discussed. The analysis
   is based on a Bayesian Machine Learning approach that uses a generative
   process. The method here adopted allows for constraint of the free
   parameters of each model by making use of the model itself only. The
   observable is taken to be the Hubble parameter, obtained from the
   generative process. Using the full advantages of our method, the models
   are constrained for two redshift ranges. Namely, first this is done with
   mock H(z) data over z is an element of {[}0, 2.5], thus covering known
   H(z) observational data, which are most helpful to validate the fit
   results. Then, aiming to extend to redshift ranges to be covered by the
   most recent ongoing and future planned missions, the models are
   constrained for the range z is an element of {[}0, 5], too. Full
   validation of the results for this extended redshift range will have to
   wait for some years, for when higher-redshift H(z) data become

Abstract = {{Individuals with substance use disorders are known to suffer from
   stress, poor sleep, and cognitive impairment. We investigated whether
   individuals with opioid use disorder would improve cognitive performance
   following a year of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). Perceived
   Stress Scale (PSS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and a
   standardized computerized cognitive battery were administered at
   admission (T0) to 29 patients, and repeatedly following one year of MMT
   (T1) by 19 patients. Admission measures did not differ between those who
   studied once or twice. Patients who perceived very high stress levels
   (PSS >= 24) at T0 (11, 37.9\%) had lower computerized global cognitive
   scores (67.6 +/- 16.2 vs. 90.9 +/- 12.5 p <= 0.0005). At T1, PSS and
   PSQI scores improved significantly among 11 patients with no substance
   abuse, but worsened among 8 with substance abuse (PSS
   p(interaction)=0.009, p(groups)=0.005, PSQI p(interaction)=0.01,
   p(groups)=0.04). Global cognitive score improved at T1 for the entire
   sample (81.8 +/- 20.1 to 89.2 +/- 13.8, p=0.05). Differentiation by high
   stress at T0 or by substance abuse at T1 subgroups showed that
   improvement was observed by those with very low cognitive scores at T0.
   Patients with poor cognition may improve following one year of MMT, due
   to stress and substance abuse reduction. Interventions for stress
   reduction are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{A wideband, monostatic simultaneous transmit and receive
   cocircularly-polarized spiral antenna with improved isolation is
   discussed. The topology with four arms is configured such that the
   opposite pairs of arms are used for transmit (TX) and receive (RX).
   Focused design for robust fabrication that ensures geometrical symmetry
   with low component imbalances for applied excitations of the two spirals
   has led to a strong rejection of the coupled voltages and, therefore,
   high TX/RX isolation. More than 14 dB higher minimum isolation is
   achieved, when compared to previous spirals from the same STAR family.
   To ensure reasonable performance in terms of axial ratio and efficiency
   over 0.5-2.5 GHz, the antenna is restively terminated, cavity backed,
   and lens loaded. The fabricated prototype is stout and achieves > 50 dB
   self-interference cancelation over the bandwidth. The copolarized TX and
   RX modes have VSWR < 2, axial ratio < 4 dB, and symmetric patterns.}},

Title = {{Classification of Biodegradable Substances Using Balanced Random Trees

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Substances that do not degrade over time have proven to be harmful to
   the environment and are dangerous to living organisms. Being able to
   predict the biodegradability of substances without costly experiments is
   useful. Recently, the quantitative structure-activity relationship
   (QSAR) models have proposed effective solutions to this problem.
   However, the molecular descriptor datasets usually suffer from the
   problems of unbalanced class distribution, which adversely affects the
   efficiency and generalization of the derived models. Accordingly, this
   study aims at validating the performances of balanced random trees (RTs)
   and boosted C5.0 decision trees (DTs) to construct QSAR models to
   classify the ready biodegradation of substances and their abilities to
   deal with unbalanced data. The balanced RTs model algorithm builds
   individual trees using balanced bootstrap samples, while the boosted
   C5.0 DT is modeled using cost-sensitive learning. We employed the
   two-dimensional molecular descriptor dataset, which is publicly
   available through the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine
   learning repository. The molecular descriptors were ranked according to
   their contributions to the balanced RTs classification process. The
   performance of the proposed models was compared with previously reported
   results. Based on the statistical measures, the experimental results
   showed that the proposed models outperform the classification results of
   the support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and
   discrimination analysis (DA). Classification measures were analyzed in
   terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, false positive
   rate, false negative rate, F1 score, receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) curve, and area under the ROC curve (AUROC).}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Here, we present cases of mandibular fracture that were
   managed with the cortical lag screw fixation technique (CLSFT) in order
   to critically evaluate technique indications and limitations of
   application at various fracture sites.
   Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. The study
   sample was composed of patients suffering from mandibular fractures that
   were treated by the CLSFT. The outcome variables were fracture type,
   duration of surgery, number of screws, and pattern of application. Other
   study categories included patient demographics and causes of injury.
   Chi-square tests were used to assess descriptive and inferential
   statistical differences, and the P-value was set at 0.05.
   Results: Thirty-three patients were included in the study sample, with a
   mean age of 30.9 +/- 11.5 years and a male predominance of 81.8\%. The
   technique was applied more frequently in the anterior mandibular region
   (51.5\%) than in other sites. Double CLSFT screws were required at the
   symphysis and parasymphysis, while single screws were used for body and
   angle regions. No intraoperative and postoperative variables were
   significantly different except for surgical duration, which was
   significantly different between the sites studied (P=0.035).
   Conclusion: We found that CLSFT is a rapid, cost-effective technique for
   the fixation of mandibular fractures yielding good treatment results and
   very limited complications. However, this technique is sensitive and
   requires surgical expertise to be applied to mandibular fractures that
   have specialized characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines popular attitudes towards cross-border shopping
   and smuggling in the Detroit-Windsor border region from 1900 to 1960.
   Reports of individuals attempting to fool border guards by failing to
   declare items, wearing multiple layers of clothing, or disguising new
   purchases as used reveal how shoppers felt entitled to goods and were
   not deterred by customs regulations. Middle-class families that might
   otherwise balk at breaking the law saw no problem with lying to border
   agents. This behaviour was highly gendered: women were characterized as
   naturally inclined to smuggle, given their love of shopping and
   inability to comprehend the law. Border guards were selective in their
   application of the law, and middle-class consumers generally had little
   to fear when they brought back purchases in excess of customs limits.
   Smuggling went both ways across the border. During the Second World War,
   Detroit residents flocked to Windsor to purchase meat and dairy
   products, while in the postwar period, Canadians more typically
   frequented American stores. This article offers a new way to think about
   consumer citizenship and how access to goods was assumed to be a right
   for people living on both sides of the border.}},

Abstract = {{Protease is a kind of enzyme with different applications in medicine and
   industry. The limitation of the enzymes in industry is lack of tolerance
   for harsh conditions (high temperature, pH, and low water condition).
   This study intends to evaluate in silico study and screen the alkaline
   serine protease producing bacteria from honey and optimize the
   production of low water active alkaline serine protease. Plackett-Burman
   method was applied to improve effective factors on protease production,
   including pH, inoculum size, temperature, time, soybean protein, KH2PO4,
   MgSO4, CaCl2, NaCl, Glycerin and glucose concentration. Further, the
   Box-Behnken method was used to optimize the significant level of
   selected factors. Besides, in silico study was utilized to create the
   enzyme structure and investigate the stability in harsh conditions. The
   results showed that the highest protease production belongs to Bacillus
   sp. Khoz1 closed Bacillus safensis, Also temperature, glucose and
   soybean protein concentration were three significant factors for
   protease production and the optimized level for them were 35 degrees C,
   0.5 g/l, and 38.32 g/l, respectively. The microorganism was able to
   produce protease until 98.36 U/ml and it was 98.68\% similar to B.
   safensis. The stability of microbial alkaline serine protease was also
   determined in high pH and temperature conditions. The best stable
   condition for isolated protease was pH 9 and temperature at 50 degrees
   C. The in silico data showed that this protease has similar 3D structure
   to Bacillus subtilis Subtilisin E and highly charge amino acids on its
   surface were that caused this enzyme still activate and stable in low
   water condition.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Acute upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding is a common
   gastrointestinal emergency and a cause of morbidity and mortality among
   the elderly. We aimed to evaluate the demographic and epidemiological
   characteristics of geriatric patients diagnosed with UGI bleeding in an
   emergency department (ED) to determine the predictors of 28-day
   mortality among them.
   Materials and Methods: All patients aged >= 65 years admitted to ED and
   diagnosed with UGI bleeding were included in this retrospective study.
   Baseline demographic and clinical/endoscopic findings were evaluated.
   The primary outcome was 28-day mortality rate and its predictors, which
   among geriatric patients diagnosed with UGI bleeding in an ED.
   Results: In total, 297 geriatric patients were included in the study; of
   them, 131 were women (44.1\%). The median patient age was 79 (65-98)
   years. During endoscopy, the most common cause of bleeding was a
   gastric/duodenal ulcer (53.9\% patients). A comparison of the patient
   characteristics in terms of in-hospital mortality
   (survivor/non-survivor) revealed significant differences in chronic
   renal failure; hemodynamic instability; hematocrit values; blood urea
   nitrogen, creatinine, and albumin levels; erythrocyte transfusion;
   rebleeding; and Rockall scores (for all variables, p<0.05). The
   regression analysis revealed that low albumin levels and hematocrit
   values as well as hemodynamic instability were the independent
   predictors of mortality.
   Conclusion: Peptic ulcer bleeding is the main cause of acute UGI
   bleeding. Low albumin levels and hematocrit values as well as
   hemodynamic instability are the independent predictors of mortality. We
   believe that geriatric patients with UGI, particularly those with
   hemodynamic compromise at the time of hospital admission, should be
   closely monitored and promptly treated.}},

Abstract = {{How can artists respond to the pressures generated by an age of
   photography and of ubiquitous imagery accredited almost no material
   value, an age in which craft has nearly vanished? I argue that Gerhard
   Richter and Norman Ackroyd each in his own way generate a particular
   freedom with respect to history (including the history of art) by
   negotiating an artworld in which abstraction and representation have no
   stable mutual hierarchy, in which the sublime and the picturesque may
   coexist. Leonardo long before discovered elements of both in his
   experience of landscape. Different as they might appear (painting versus
   aquatint; luxury versus affordable), Richter's and Ackroyd's works each
   establish a kind of art object that is not only postaura but also
   disdains the claims of uniqueness and of the immediately, thoroughly
   autograph: authentic, not self-expressive works of art that involve
   handwork even as they invoke mechanisms of replication. They renew the
   sublime via varieties of blankness adjusted for a world of dauntingly
   vast information resources.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a system design optimization for a circular
   k-out-of-n: G balanced system with equal load-sharing units. The system
   consists of n identical units whose failure times are assumed to follow
   an exponential distribution, and it is subject to an equally shared load
   among the working units. The load-sharing relationship between the
   amount of load and the failure rates of the working units is assumed to
   follow a power rule. If the system is not balanced, it can be balanced
   by forcing some operating units into standby or returning the standby
   units into operation. We arrange the system failure paths and use them
   in the exact reliability evaluation for systems with a small number of
   units (rotors). Due to the longer computation time, we use a Monte Carlo
   simulation to approximate the reliability of systems with a large number
   of units (rotors). We apply two maintenance policies, corrective
   maintenance, and condition-based preventive maintenance, to understand
   the effects of system balance conditions, load-sharing rule parameters,
   system configuration k, and various cost parameters on the optimal
   maintenance settings, using numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{The study aims to estimate the effect of current ratio (CR), current

   (F\&B) sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) from
   2014-2018. The data estimation method uses the common effect panel data
   regression model. The empirical findings show that the CR and CLI ratios
   have a negative effect on PG, while the TAT, NPM, and SG ratios have a
   positive effect. Company size is a factor that does not affect the
   growth of company profits. The results of the study imply that an
   increase in company profits can be achieved if the company operates
   efficiently and with low liquidity to encourage higher sales growth. The
   limitations of the research are as follows: first, this research
   considers only one type of industry, hence the results of this study
   would not be the same if applied to another type of industry. Second,
   the author observes profit growth by using the company's financial

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Flexible production is a key element in modern industrial manufacturing.
   Autonomous mobile manipulators can be used to execute various tasks:
   from logistics, to pick and place, or handling. Therefore, autonomous
   robotic systems can even increase the flexibility of existing production
   environments. However, the application of robotic systems is challenging
   due to their complexity and safety concerns. This paper addresses the
   design and implementation of the autonomous mobile manipulator OMNIVIL.
   A holonomic kinematic design provides high maneuverability and the
   implemented sensor setup with the underlying localization strategies are
   robust against typical static and dynamic uncertainties in industrial
   environments. For a safe and efficient human-robot collaboration (HRC),
   a novel workspace monitoring system (WMS) is developed to detect human
   co-workers and other objects in the workspace. The multilayer sensor
   setup and the parallel data analyzing capability provide superior
   accuracy and reliability. An intuitive zone-based navigation concept is
   implemented, based on the workspace monitoring system. Preventive
   behaviors are predefined for a conflict-free interaction with human
   co-workers. A workspace analyzing tool is implemented for adaptive
   manipulation, which significantly simplifies the determination of
   suitable platform positions for a manipulation task.}},

Abstract = {{In foxes, Vulpes vulpes, the dewclaw sits on the forelimb a bit up from
   the ground. It is usually thought to be functionless. The length of
   metacarpal 1 and metacarpal 3, as well as the relation between them
   (Mc1/Mc3), increases northwards from Denmark to northern Sweden. If it
   were the same physiological system regulating the growth of all the
   metacarpal bones, they would increase at the same ratio and the long
   metacarpal 3 (43-64 mm) would therefore increase northwards in absolute
   length more than the shorter metacarpal 1 (13-20 nun). In this case the
   dewclaw in northern foxes would be set higher above the ground than in
   southern ones. If measured as a percentage, however, the mean length of
   metacarpal 1 shows a larger increase northwards than that of the other
   metacarpal bones. The tip of the nail of the dewclaw in foxes is shown
   to be 12-15 mm above the ground in all areas in Scandinavia, and the
   dewclaw is therefore considered to have an important function. It is
   believed to increase the effectiveness of hunting voles, when the
   dewclaws will hit the back of the prey.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) increases the risk
   of complications and mortality. We assessed the magnitude of these
   outcomes in a large cohort of English patients with initial and
   recurrent CDI.
   Aim: To compare the risk of complications and all-cause mortality,
   within 12 months, among hospitalized patients >18 years old with
   hospital-associated(HA-) CDI and recurrent CDI.
   Methods: Patients with HA-CDI during 2002-2013 were identified using
   inpatient hospital data linked to primary care and death data. Each
   HA-CDI case was frequency matched to two hospitalized patients without
   CDI on age group, sex, calendar year of admission, admission method and
   number of hospital care episodes. A second CDI episode starting on days
   13-56 was defined as recurrence. Risks of mortality and complications at
   12 months were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models.
   Findings: We included 6862 patients with HA-CDI and 13,724 without CDI.
   Median age was 81.0 years (IQR 71.0-87.0). Patients with HA-CDI had more
   comorbidities than those without CDI, and significantly higher risks of
   mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval) 1.77
   (1.67-1.87)) and complications (1.66 (1.46-1.88)) within 12 months from
   hospital admission. Of those with HA-CDI, 1140 (16.6\%) experienced CDI
   recurrence. Patients with recurrent versus non-recurrent CDI also had
   significantly increased risk of mortality (1.32 (1.20-1.45)) and
   complications (1.37 (1.01-1.84)) in the 12 months from the initial CDI.
   Conclusions: HA-CDI (versus no CDI) and recurrent CDI are both
   associated with significantly higher risks of complications or death
   within 12 months of the initial CDI episode. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act
   (HITECH) successfully encouraged widespread adoption of electronic
   health records (EHR). Their suitability for ``big data{''} analysis make
   EHR data immensely valuable for secondary research, which could help
   scientists develop new drugs, medical devices, and public-health
   knowledge. Thus far, EHR data have not been widely available to academic
   medical scientists in quantities sufficient to support big data
   analysis. Instead, the data are aggregated, analyzed, and sold by
   insurance companies, EHR vendors, and other medical informatics firms.
   This Note argues that the advent of the EHR data market is a direct
   result of HITECH's interaction with the Health Insurance Portability and
   Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (together, the ``Privacy Regime{''}).
   The Privacy Regime (1) establishes the necessary preconditions for the
   EHR data market; (2) funnels EHR data towards a few large firms; and (3)
   prevents others, including academic scientists, from acquiring data in
   similarly large quantities.
   The Privacy Regime has radically changed medical research regulation.
   Traditional clinical trials and retrospective studies are governed by
   the familiar safeguards of medical ethics including IRB review, peer
   review, and publication. But under the Privacy Regime, private-sector
   EHR-based studies are not subject to any ethical review. This result
   subverts the fundamental principles of medical ethics and inhibits
   socially valuable public-sector research. This Note proposes reforming
   the Privacy Regime to subject all medical research to ethical review and
   to incentivize private firms to share EHR data with academic
   researchers.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse patterns of life-course marijuana use may have differential
   health impacts for the children of users. Data are drawn from an
   intergenerational study of 426 families that included a parent, their
   oldest biological child, and (where appropriate) another caregiver who
   were interviewed 10 times from 2002 to 2018: the current study used data
   from 380 families in waves 6-10. Analyses linked parent marijuana use
   trajectories estimated i n a previous publication (Epstein et al., 2015)
   to child marijuana, alcohol, and nicotine use; promarijuana norms;
   internalizing; externalizing; attention problems; and grades using
   multilevel modeling among children ages 6 to 21. Four trajectories had
   been found in the previous study: nonuser, chronic, adolescent-limited,
   and late-onset. Results indicate that children of parents in the groups
   that initiated marijuana use in adolescence (chronic and
   adolescent-limited) were most likely to use substances. Children of
   parents in the late-onset group, where parents initiated use in young
   adulthood, were not at increased risk for substance use but were more
   likely to have attention problems and lower grades. Results held when
   parent current marijuana use was added to the models. Implications of
   this work highlight the importance of considering both current use and
   use history in intergenerational transmission of marijuana use, and the
   need to address parent use history in family based prevention.
   Prevention of adolescent marijuana use remains a priority.}},

Abstract = {{Prior studies suggest high prevalence of intracranial aneurysms (IA) in
   patients with infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). We reviewed
   our multicenter experience in clinical detection/treatment of IAs in AAA
   patients and estimated the risk of IA in patients with AAA relative to
   patients without AAA. We reviewed cases of vascular surgery infrarenal
   AAA repairs at three Mayo Clinic sites from January 1998 to December
   2018. Concurrent controls were randomly matched in a 1:1 ratio by age,
   sex, smoking history, and head imaging characteristics. Conditional
   logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios. We reviewed 2,300
   infrarenal AAA repairs. Mean size of AAA at repair was 56.9 +/- 11.4mm;
   mean age at repair, 75.8 +/- 8.0 years. 87.5\% of the cases (n=2014)
   were men. Head imaging was available in 421 patients. Thirty-seven
   patients were found to have 45 IAs for a prevalence of 8.8\%. Mean size
   of IA was 4.6 +/- 3.5mm; mean age at IA detection, 72.0 +/- 10.8 years.
   Thirty (81\%) out of 37 patients were men. Six patients underwent
   treatment for IA: four for ruptured IAs and two for unruptured IAs. All
   were diagnosed before AAA repair. Treatment included five clippings and
   one coil-assisted stenting. Time from IA diagnosis to AAA repair was
   16.4 +/- 11.0 years. Two of these patients presented with ruptured AAA,
   one with successful repair and a second one that resulted in death. Odds
   of IA were higher for patients with AAA versus those without AAA (8.8\%
   {[}37/421] vs. 3.1\% {[}13/421]; OR 3.18; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.62-6.27,p<0.001). Co-prevalence of IA among patients with AAA was
   8.8\% and is more than three times the rate seen in patients without
   AAA. All IAs were diagnosed prior to AAA repair. Surveillance for AAA
   after IA treatment could have prevented two AAA ruptures and one death.}},

Title = {{An allomaltol derivative triggers distinct death pathways in luminal a
   and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes}},
Journal = {{BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{105}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women that shows a
   predisposition to metastasize to the distant organs. Kojic acid is a
   natural fungal metabolite exhibiting various biological activities.
   Compounds derived from kojic acid have been extensively studied and
   proved to demonstrate anti-neoplastic features on different cancer
   types. In the present study, allomaltol-structural analog of kojic acid
   and its seven derivatives including four novel compounds, have been
   synthesized, characterized and their possible impact on breast cancer
   cell viability was investigated. It was discovered that compound 5,
   bearing 3,4-dichlorobenzyl piperazine moiety, could decrease the
   viability of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines distinctively. To
   ascertain the death mechanism, cells were subjected to different tests
   following the application of IC50 concentration of compound 5. Data
   obtained from lactate dehydrogenase activity and gene expression assays
   pointed out that necrosis had taken place predominantly in MDA-MB-231.
   On the other hand, in MCF-7 cells, the p53 apoptotic pathway was
   activated by overexpression of the pro-apoptotic TP53 and Bax genes and
   suppression of the anti-apoptotic Mdm-2 and Bcl-2 genes. Furthermore,
   Bax/Blc-2 ratio was escalated by 3.5 fold in the study group compared to
   the control. Compound 5 did not provoke drug resistance in MCF-7 cells
   since the Mdr-1 gene expression, drug efflux, and H2O2 content remained
   unaltered. As for MDA-MB-231 cells, only a 1.4 fold increase in the
   Mdr-1 gene expression was detected. These results indicate the advantage
   of the allomaltol derivative over the chemotherapeutic agents
   conventionally used for breast cancer treatment that can be highly toxic
   and mostly lead to drug resistance. Thus, this specific allomaltol
   derivative offers an alternative therapeutic approach for breast cancer
   which needs further investigation.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS}},

Abstract = {{Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a prominent mediatory player during the
   cell cycle, mitosis, and cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells. Besides its
   physiological roles, PLK1 expression is upregulated in a wide range of
   human malignant tumors and its overexpression worsens prognosis,
   therefore, specific inhibition of PLK1 in tumor cells is a fascinating
   approach for the development of novel chemotherapeutics. The present
   study elucidated the potential cytotoxic effects of a PLK1 inhibitor,
   GSK461364A, in five cancer cell lines including Raji, K562, PC3, MCF-7,
   MDA-MB-231, along with noncancerous L929 cells by XTT assay. The cells
   were treated for 24 h with GSK461364A at different concentrations ranged
   between 0.5 and 40 mu M and significant cytotoxicity was observed in all
   treated groups with the IC50 values between 2.36 and 4.08 mu M.
   GSK461364A was also found to be safer with lower cytotoxicity against
   L929 cells and the IC50 value was found to be greater than 40 mu M. Raji
   cells were identified as the most sensitive cell line against GSK461364A
   with the lowest IC50 values, hence it was selected for further studies
   to evaluate the underlying mechanism of cytotoxic activity. The
   treatment of Raji cells with GSK461364A caused a cell cycle arrest at
   the G2/M phase, also altered TOS, which is an indicator of oxidative
   stress, and DNA damage response, significantly. The Annexin V binding
   assay revealed that GSK461364A treatment significantly increased in the
   percentage of early and late apoptotic cells. Fluorescence imaging also
   showed that GSK461364A treatment significantly induced apoptosis of Raji
   cells. The apoptotic effect of the compound has also been confirmed by
   increased expressions of Bax and cleaved caspase 3 and along with the
   decreased expression of BCL-2. The results demonstrated that GSK461364A
   induced anticancer effects which was mainly promoted by cell cycle
   arrest, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and finally apoptosis in Burkitt's
   lymphoma cells. Taken together, the present results emphasized that
   GSK461364A could be a useful therapeutic agent in patients with
   Burkitt's lymphoma. However, further studies are required to consolidate
   the anticancer activity of this promising compound.}},

Abstract = {{Compliance with the Lieb-Oxford bound for the indirect Coulomb energy
   and for the exchange-correlation energy is investigated for a number of
   density-functional methods based on the adiabatic-connection
   fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem to treat correlation.
   Furthermore, the correlation contribution to the pair density resulting
   from these methods is compared with highly accurate reference values for
   the helium atom and for the hydrogen molecule at several bond distances.
   For molecules, the Lieb-Oxford bound is obeyed by all considered
   methods. For the homogeneous electron gas, it is violated by all methods
   for low electron densities. The simplest considered ACFD method, the
   direct random phase approximation (dRPA), violates the Lieb-Oxford bound
   much earlier than more advanced ACFD methods that, in addition to the
   simple Hartree kernel, take into account the exchange kernel and an
   approximate correlation kernel in the calculation of the correlation
   energy. While the dRPA yields quite poor correlation contributions to
   the pair density, those from more advanced ACFD methods are physically
   reasonable but still leave room for improvements, particularly in the
   case of the stretched hydrogen molecule.}},

Abstract = {{The results of two national oral health surveys in 1993/4 led the
   Seychelles School Dental Service (SDS) to implement an oral health
   improvement strategy through the adoption of a targeted population
   approach. The aim was to attain the World Health Organization's (WHO)
   goal for 12-year-olds, of a DMFT (decayed, missing, filled permanent
   teeth) of less than 3.0, by the year 2000. Primary 5 (P5) children from
   all state schools were selected as the target population. Although all
   the children (1538) were exposed to the targeted service interventions,
   500 were sampled out for study, through random sampling of school class
   lists. Data was collected at the beginning of 1998 and end of 2000,
   through clinical examination and self-administered questionnaires. All
   examinations and interventions were carried out by dental therapists
   (DTs), in their respective clinics. For the purpose of this paper
   comparisons made between 12-year-olds of 1994 and those of 2000 are
   based only on the dental examination data. Interventions were spread
   over three years from 1998 to 2000. These included an initial dental
   examination followed by any dental treatment required, an annual recall
   visit, dental health education at class and individual level, and weekly
   school-based fluoride mouth rinses. Parameters investigated were 1)
   community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN), 2) dental health
   status (DMFT), 3) enamel defect, and 4) clinic attendance. All
   parameters improved significantly between the cohort of 1994 and that of
   2000. The proportion of children and of sextants with healthy gingivae
   increased from 3.4\% to 51.8\% and from 25.9\% to 70.9\% respectively.
   Children with no enamel defects increased from 51.1\% to. 92.6\%, while
   children with newly decayed teeth decreased from 61\% to 33\%. The mean
   number of newly decayed teeth fell from 2.0 to 0.8. The proportion of
   children attending their clinic at least once a year for check up
   increased from 51\% in 1994 through 73\% in 1998 to almost 100\% in
   2000. The WHO goal for children aged 12 years to have a DMFT of less
   than 3 was met, with a change from 3.2 in 1994 to 1.9 in 2000.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The prognostic significance of the platelet (PLR) and
   neutrophil (NLR) to lymphocyte ratios for patients with resectable
   colorectal cancer liver metastases (CLM) was evaluated.
   Methods: Clinicopathologic data from patients who underwent hepatectomy
   for CLM at two tertiary care hospitals between 1995 and 2017 were
   collected. Blood counts were evaluated for prognostic significance.
   Results: 151 patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 58
   years, 44\% were female, and 58\% had synchronous metastases. Median
   number of liver metastases was 2, and 59\% of patients underwent
   lobectomy or extended lobectomy. On multivariable analysis, NLR >5 (HR
   2.46 {[}1.08-5.60 CI], p = 0.032), PLR > 220 (HR 2.10 {[}1.04-4.23 CI],
   p = 0.037), and greater than 2 liver metastases (HR 2.41 {[}1.06-5.45
   CI], p = 0.035) were associated with reduced overall survival.
   Conclusions: PLR > 220 and NLR > 5 may have utility as preoperative
   prognostic markers for overall survival in patients with resectable CLM.

Title = {{PRESERVATION OF DIGITIZED INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE IN MUSEUM STORAGE}},
Journal = {{MILLI FOLKLOR}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{128}},
Pages = {{100-110}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Conservation, research and communication are the basic functions of the
   museums according to the new museological approach, and conservation is
   one of the core missions since the birth of the museums. On the other
   hand, collections are the hearth of the museums and contribute to their
   development and activities. Storage areas protect collections and
   provides sustainability for the collection management. In this context,
   one of the main duties of museums is to maintain and manage collections
   in storage area under appropriate and safe conditions. Most of the
   museums in the world exhibit only a small percentage of their
   collections and so many collection items are housed in storage. Storage
   areas require regular monitoring, control and maintenance similar to
   exhibition galleries. Physical and environmental conditions of storage
   areas, storage systems and methods differ according to the material,
   condition, quantity and dimensions of the museum collections. Museum
   collections are defined as movable, immovable as well as tangible and
   intangible cultural heritage. Today, digital heritage is also part of
   the collections. Digital museum collections can be defined as born
   digital, digital or digitized item. Collecting, conservation,
   documentation, accessing or storage procedures of movable or tangible
   heritage in museums are on practice with well-developed principles,
   standards as well as collection management and conservation policies.
   However, identification, documentation, the concept of authenticity or
   issues of ownership of intangible cultural heritage is still on
   discussion. Digital preservation is also one of the recent research
   topics and practices for safeguarding of the intangible cultural
   heritage. In this context, digitized intangible cultural heritage can
   defined as digital resources that are digitized from audio-visual
   recordings, photographs or ephemera which documents and preserves
   practices and their tools or spaces associated with. However, technology
   is developing much faster today and most of the digital tools have a
   very short life span. Thus, technological development is a challenge for
   preserving digitized intangible cultural heritage. In a broader sense,
   preservation of digital heritage in the museum storage areas including
   physical and environmental conditions of the storage area where the
   digital heritage is located, their storage system, method and the
   storage management procedures are different comparing to the
   preservation of tangible heritage or other movable cultural assets. In
   this framework, main research questions of this article are: How the
   digitalization practices contribute to the safeguarding of the
   intangible cultural heritage? As technology is changing rapidly, how the
   preservation tools and storage methods of the digitized intangible
   cultural heritage can be kept up with the technological developments?
   How long the life span of the digitized intangible cultural heritage
   collections can be extended in museum storage? The article will mainly
   focus on the storage management of digitized intangible cultural
   heritage, and explain their physical and environmental conditions in the
   museum storage area. Terms of digital heritage, digitized intangible
   cultural heritage, digital preservation as well as the history of
   digital preservation of museum collections, organizations/institutions'
   contributions in the field will be discussed. Information about the
   storage system, storage method with safe materials and procedures will
   be provided within the scope of literature review.
   The paper highlights contributions of the digitalization practices to
   the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage, major issues and
   challenges related to the digital preservation in museum storage, and
   propose steps for the sustainable storage management of digitized
   intangible cultural heritage.}},

   return to their jobs, friends and families, and the activities of their
   community, community-based provider organizations must strike a
   difficult balance between actions that are intended to protect the
   health and safety of people they support and actions that honor people's
   choices and encourage self-determination. Practical issues that
   community-based provider organizations must consider when striking the

Abstract = {{The seeds of Ammodaucus leucotrichus Cosson and Durieu have been used in

   The present study investigates the antidiabetic, antihyperglycemic, and
   anti-inflammatory properties of the defatted hydroethanolic extract of
   Ammodaucus leucotrichus (DHEAM). The antidiabetic and the
   antihyperglycemic studies were assessed on alloxan-induced diabetic with
   orally administered doses of DHEAM (100 and 200 mg/kg). At the same
   time, its anti-inflammatory propriety was evaluated by measuring edema
   development in the Wistar rats paw induced with carrageenan. Treatment
   of diabetic mice with DHEAM for four weeks managed their high fasting
   blood glucose levels, improved their overall health, and also revealed
   an excellent antihyperglycemic activity. Following the anti-inflammatory
   results, DHEAM exhibited a perfect activity. HPLC results revealed the
   presence of seven molecules (chlorogenic acid, 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid,
   gallic acid, ferulic acid, myricetin, quercetin, luteolin). This work
   indicates that the DHEAM has an important antidiabetic,
   antihyperglycemic, and anti-inflammatory effect that can be well
   established as a phytomedicine to treat diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Portfolio insurance strategies that ensure a certain minimum portfolio
   value or floor such as the Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance
   (CPPI) and the Option-based Portfolio Insurance are economically
   important and widely spread among the banking and insurance industries.
   In distress and volatile market environments, investors such as pension
   funds have a need to insure their portfolios against downside risk in
   order to meet certain future payments or liabilities. Non-anticipated
   shocks or negative interest rates, jumps, crashes, or overnight trading
   restrictions in stock prices could drop pension fund portfolios below
   desired levels (present value of pension obligations) making them
   underfunded with pension assets to pension liabilities ratio below
   100\%. In particular, within the current low interest rate environment,
   a high number of pension funds happen to be underfunded which is a
   severe practical problem. Because of such scenarios, there is a need for
   an investment strategy which covers both the case of funded and
   underfunded portfolios. This article introduces a novel strategy which
   generalizes the CPPI approach. It has the overall target of guaranteeing
   the investment goal or floor while participating in the performance of
   the assets and limiting the downside risk of the portfolio at the same
   time. We show that the strategy accounts for behavioral aspects of the
   investor such as distorted probabilities, a risk-averse behavior for
   gains, and a risk-seeking behavior for losses. The proposed strategy
   turns out to be optimal within the Cumulative Prospect Theory framework
   by Tversky and Kahneman (J Risk Uncertain 5(4):297-323, 1992).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Growth, meat quality, and carcass traits are of economic importance in
   swine breeding. Understanding their genetic basis in purebred (PB) and
   commercial crossbred (CB) pigs is necessary for a successful breeding
   program because, although the breeding goal is to improve CB
   performance, phenotype collection and selection are usually carried out
   in PB populations housed in biosecure nucleus herds. Thus, the selection
   is indirect, and the accuracy of selection depends on the genetic
   correlation between PB and CB performance (r(pc)). The objectives of
   this study were to 1) estimate genetic parameters for growth, meat
   quality, and carcass traits in a PB sire line and related commercial CB
   pigs and 2) estimate the corresponding genetic correlations between
   purebred and crossbred performance (r(pc)). Both objectives were
   investigated by using pedigree information only (PBLUP) and by combining
   pedigree and genomic information in a single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP)
   procedure. Growth rate showed moderate estimates of heritability for
   both PB and CB based on PBLUP, while estimates were higher in CB based
   on ssGBLUP. Heritability estimates for meat quality traits were diverse
   and slightly different based on PB and CB data with both methods.
   Carcass traits had higher heritability estimates based on PB compared
   with CB data based on PBLUP and slightly higher estimates for CB data
   based on ssGBLUP. A wide range of estimates of genetic correlations were
   obtained among traits within the PB and CB data. In the PB population,
   estimates of heritabilities and genetic correlations were similar based
   on PBLUP and ssGBLUP for all traits, while based on the CB data, ssGBLUP
   resulted in different estimates of genetic parameters with lower SEs.
   With some exceptions, estimates of r(pc) were moderate to high. The SE
   on the r(pc) estimates was generally large when based on PBLUP due to
   limited sample size, especially for CBs. In contrast, estimates of r(pc)
   based on ssGBLUP were not only more precise but also more consistent
   among pairs of traits, considering their genetic correlations within the
   PB and CB data. The wide range of estimates of r(pc) (less than 0.70 for
   7 out of 13 traits) indicates that the use of CB phenotypes recorded on
   commercial farms, along with genomic information, for selection in the
   PB population has potential to increase the genetic progress of CB
   performance.}},

Title = {{The experiences of family caregivers who participated in a family
   involvement program after cancer surgery: A qualitative study}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{49}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: As recovery time after oncological surgery can be long, family
   caregivers often play an important role in the delivery of care after
   patients' discharge. To prepare carers for this role, we developed a
   family involvement program (FIP) to enhance their active involvement in
   post-surgical oncology care during hospitalization. The purpose of this
   qualitative study was to explore family caregivers experience of
   participating in a FIP.
   Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 family
   caregivers who participated in the family involvement program. The
   program is comprised of two main components (1) training and coaching of
   physicians and nurses; (2) active involvement of family caregivers in
   fundamental care activities. This active involvement included six
   activities. Data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological
   analysis.
   Results: Family caregivers positively valued the program. Active
   participation in post-surgical care was experienced as an acceptable
   burden. The program gave participants the ability to simply be present
   ('being there') which was considered as essential and improved their
   understanding of care, although family caregivers sometimes experienced
   emotional moments. Active involvement strengthened existent relationship
   between the family caregiver and the patient. Participants thought
   clinical supervision. by nurses is important.
   Conclusions: Physical proximity appeared as an essential part of the
   family involvement program. It helped carers to feel they made a
   meaningful contribution to their loved ones' wellbeing. Asking families
   to participate in fundamental care activities in post-surgical oncology
   care was acceptable, and not over-demanding for caregivers.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: We hypothesized that trauma providers are reticent to
   consider palliative measures in acute trauma care.
   Methods: An electronic survey based on four patient scenarios with
   identical vital signs and serious blunt injuries, but differing ages and
   frailty scores was sent to WTA and EAST members.
   Results: 509 (24\%) providers completed the survey. Providers supported
   early transition to comfort care in 85\% old-frail, 53\% old-fit, 77\%
   young-frail, and 30\% young -fit patients. Providers were more likely to
   transition frail vs. fit patients with (OR = 4.8 {[}3.8-6.3], p < 0.001)
   or without (OR = 16.7 {[}12.5-25.0], p < 0.001) an advanced directive
   (AD) and more likely to transition old vs. young patients with (OR = 2.0
   {[}1.6-2.6], p < 0.001) or without (OR = 4.2 {[}2.8-5.0], p < 0.001) an
   AD.
   Conclusions: In specific clinical situations, there was wide acceptance
   among trauma providers for the early institution of palliative measures.
   Provider decision-making was primarily based on patient frailty and age.
   ADs were helpful for fit or young patients. Provider demographics did
   not impact decision making. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to generate a tree of science for
   deliberate and emergent strategies using the online application Tree of
   Science (ToS), which is based on the theory of graphs, and is formed by
   networks of knowledge through citing and referencing academic documents,
   and dividing them into roots, trunks and leaves. It was confirmed that
   the fundamental root of deliberate and emergent strategies was centred
   on the contributions of Mintzberg and his coauthors; in addition, there
   were fundamental developments within the trunk, such as decision-making,
   the role of intermediate managers, supply chains, and organisational
   performance. As for the leaves, new relationships emerged with
   innovation, entrepreneurship, and chaos theory, amongst others.
   Limitations in this research include the fact that ToS is restricted to

Abstract = {{Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is a
   rare disease that requires multidisciplinary approach in patient
   management. The disease is genetically heterogenous and has an extremely
   variable expressivity. Although the syndrome is in the focus of
   scientific research, our knowledge of it is still limited due to the
   relatively low number of recognised patients and the complexity of
   genotype-phenotype correlation. Several papers in this field have been
   published in the international and also in the Hungarian literature but
   most of these reports are single cases or small case series of families
   and outline general information about the disease. Authors aimed to
   review the literature of the syndrome and to report the genetic
   background and its role in the diagnosis and treatment. A review of the
   English and Hungarian literature was performed. The full genetic
   background of the syndrome is not yet discovered. Increasing the
   awareness of the syndrome, collecting and thoroughly analysing the
   medical records and performing genetic tests on the patients may lead to
   the better understanding of the disease; they may also help early
   diagnosis and treatment, positive family planning and may establish
   personalized medicine.}},

Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{337-349}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The agricultural sector, an important economic sector in Greece, is
   inextricably faced with health and safety risks, with farmers
   encountering various health and safety risks in their farming
   activities. A quantitative survey on a random sample of 263 farmers in a
   remote Greek region was conducted to achieve the threefold objectives of
   this work: First, to assess the health and safety hazards associated
   with the agricultural profession, along with exploring the distinct
   socio-demographic characteristics of farmers that express job
   satisfaction and prefer the public health and insurance system; second,
   to investigate the effectiveness of social policies on health and safety
   issues confronted by farmers; third, to assess any correlation between
   job satisfaction and perception of social policy practices. Results
   indicate that women, younger and highly educated farmers are more
   optimistic about the agricultural profession and take individual
   protective measures. Women in their 30s, highly educated and with lower
   incomes prefer the public health insurance system, whereas the private
   health and insurance system is the choice of male farmers with high
   family incomes and large farms. Most farmers have mainly experienced
   respiratory, ophthalmic and otalgia problems and had more working
   accidents in comparison to other economic activities.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection causes tuberculosis (TB), a
   disease characterized by development of granulomas. Granulomas consist
   of activated immune cells that cluster together to limit bacterial
   growth and restrict dissemination. Control of the TB epidemic has been
   limited by lengthy drug regimens, antibiotic resistance, and lack of a
   robustly efficacious vaccine. Fibrosis commonly occurs during treatment
   and is associated with both positive and negative disease outcomes in TB
   but little is known about the processes that initiate fibrosis in
   granulomas. Human and nonhuman primate granulomas undergoing fibrosis
   can have spindle-shaped macrophages with fibroblast-like morphologies
   suggesting a relationship between macrophages, fibroblasts, and
   granuloma fibrosis. This relationship has been difficult to investigate
   because of the limited availability of human pathology samples, the time
   scale involved in human TB, and overlap between fibroblast and myeloid
   cell markers in tissues. To better understand the origins of fibrosis in
   TB, we used a computational model of TB granuloma biology to identify
   factors that drive fibrosis over the course of local disease
   progression. We validated the model with granulomas from nonhuman
   primates to delineate myeloid cells and lung-resident fibroblasts. Our
   results suggest that peripheral granuloma fibrosis, which is commonly
   observed, can arise through macrophage-to-myofibroblast transformation
   (MMT). Further, we hypothesize that MMT is induced in M1 macrophages
   through a sequential combination of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
   signaling in granuloma macrophages. We predict that MMT may be a
   mechanism underlying granuloma-associated fibrosis and warrants further
   investigation into myeloid cells as drivers of fibrotic disease.
   Author summary
   Tuberculosis is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a
   bacterium that infects over a third of the world's population. The only
   available vaccine for TB has limited efficacy and drug treatment
   involves several antibiotics that are taken for several months. These
   drugs can have significant side-effects and a lack of compliance can
   lead to drug resistance in Mtb. A hallmark of Mtb infection is the
   development of clusters of cells that form around infected macrophages
   to contain the infection called granulomas. Older granulomas, or
   granulomas in patients treated with antibiotic, often become fibrotic
   and this can cause chronic lung problems long after the Mtb infection
   has cleared. The process that drives a fibrotic outcome has been
   difficult to assess in vivo. Herein we combined wet-lab and
   computational experimentation to identify a novel mechanism leading to
   peripheral fibrosis in granulomas. We find that macrophages transforming
   into myofibroblast-like cells, may be a key pathway to
   granuloma-associated fibrosis, a phenomena that has not been well
   characterized in vivo. Further we identified factors that can inhibit
   fibrosis development during TB that could be therapeutic targets during
   TB treatment to limit the risk of long-term tissue damage in TB.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we consider how Covid-19 revealed the extent to which,
   in Britain, the core functions of labour law have been compromised by
   successive governments stretching back to the 1980s and how workers
   collectively have been failed as a result by a discipline intended
   ostensibly in their interests. We seek to measure these deficits against
   a set of core normative principles rooted in ILO standards which we
   believe underpin labour law as a discipline of worker protection. We
   look first at the exploitation of critical workers; second at the
   failure generally to make adequate provision for income security; and
   third at issues relating to health and safety at work. Our consideration
   of these issues addresses both the substantive law and the means for its
   enforcement. Having considered the systemic failures and lack of
   resilience of British labour law in this article, we intend to return to
   the theme in Part II at a later date to address the lessons learned and
   the overhaul which the pandemic has revealed to be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening (UNHS) includes as
   its main objective, that all Newborns (NB) receive an audiological
   evaluation during their first month of life.
   Objective: To determine the prevalence of hearing loss in a population
   of healthy NB in a tertiary care hospital in Mexico City.
   Material and methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was designed.
   The period was from October 1, 2011 to May 15, 2019. UNHS was performed
   with a flowchart in three phases using Transient Evoked Otoacoustic
   Emissions and Brainstem auditory evoked potentials. Data were analyzed
   using descriptive statistics.
   Results: 14,000 NB were evaluated, 28,000 ears. Gender was distributed
   in n = 7038 (50.3\%) males and n = 6962 (49.7\%) females. The mean age
   at the time of the first UNHS study was 48.3 +/- 22.2 days. Hearing loss
   was confirmed in n = 31 (0.22\%) NB, in 20 (64\%) of the cases with
   hearing loss there were no documented audiological risk factors.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of hearing loss was 2.2 per 1000 NB in a
   tertiary care hospital in Mexico City. Diagnosis and early habilitation
   of hearing loss in NB constitute quality indicators in health care and
   guarantee the best prognosis for NB with hearing loss.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The use of inorganic ions as conservative tracers in porous media is
   limited by the need of complex and expensive analytical techniques, such
   as inductively coupled plasma (ICP), for tracer quantification. In this
   work, a cost-effective and straightforward in-house method was developed
   using fluorescence spectroscopy to quantify lithium in a high salinity
   brine, based on the formation of a complex with quinizarin (Li-Q). The
   method was adjusted to minimize interferences from Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in
   the effluent, and to avoid extensive dilution steps in the
   quantification procedure. This approach yielded a sub-millimolar
   detection limit (8.2 x 10(-5) mol L-1) in the conservative tracer tests
   performed using four different rock samples, namely two sandstone and
   two carbonate cores, at 13.8 MPa and 20 degrees C. The
   breakthrough/elution curves obtained for Berea sandstones showed
   distinct characteristics of homogeneous rocks, such as the sharp
   increase in lithium concentration, in contrast with the sluggish profile
   observed for more heterogeneous Indiana limestones. Moreover, the
   sensitivity of the method allowed to calculate the swept volumes for
   both cores, which resembled the rock pore volumes measured with nitrogen
   gas. These results compared well with those obtained using ICP-OES as a
   reference method (>95\% agreement), which demonstrated that the proposed
   Li-Q fluorescence method can be used as an efficient alternative method
   to quantify lithium in conservative tracer tests for coreflood studies,
   significantly reducing time and cost of analysis, with potential to be
   used for field applications.}},

Abstract = {{Green Human Resource Management (GHRM) has emerged as the driving force
   for businesses in the 21st century, as it is practiced by many
   progressive organizations globally. GHRM is considered as a source that
   is capable of gaining sustainable competitive advantage. For SMEs, it
   will not only provide impetus to growth but also a path towards
   sustainability. The current study intends to identify the most relevant
   aspects of GHRM, considered important by SMEs. Moreover, the study also
   intends to examine what should be the focal area among SMEs from the
   perspective of GHRM. The study is significant due to the fact that most
   SMEs lacks formal and full-fledged HRM department/activities due to
   financial and size constraints. The current study is grounded on the
   methodology of a multi-criteria decisionmaking approach, as without a
   scientific background and analogy, a sound decision making is not
   feasible. The current study utilises the Analytical Hierarchy Process
   (AHP), a multi-criteria decision making tool to support the objectives
   of the study. The data for the study was collected from the human
   resource managers/owners of facility management companies, based in
   Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia. Based on the results derived from
   analysis, the study establish the analogy that facility management SMEs
   in Saudi Arabia are least concerned about the ``Green HR Acquisition{''}
   but moderately concerned about ``Green HR orientation, Training and
   development{''}, and are highly concerned about ``Retaining highly
   competent employees in green HR practices{''}. The implication of the
   study will be useful for mangers/owner of SMEs, and academicians.}},

Abstract = {{Putrescine (Put) can enhance secondary metabolite production, but its
   intrinsic regulatory mechanism remains unclear. In this study, Put
   treatment promoted betulin production and gene expression of lupeol
   synthase (LUS), one of betulin synthetic enzymes. The maximum betulin
   content and gene expression level of LUS was 4.25 mg center dot g(-1) DW
   and 8.25 at 12 h after 1 mmol center dot L-1 Put treatment,
   approximately two- and four-times that in the control, respectively. Put
   treatment increased the content of nitric oxide (NO) and its
   biosynthetic enzyme activity of nitrate reductase (NR) and NO synthase
   (NOS). Pretreatment of the birch suspension cells with NO-specific
   scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-
   1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), NR inhibitor sodium azide (NaN3), and NOS
   inhibitor N-G-nitro-L-Arg methyl ester (L-NAME) decreased Put-triggered
   NO generation and blocked Put-induced betulin production. Put treatment
   improved the content of NH4+ and its assimilation enzyme activity of
   glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase. NH4+ supplementation
   also promoted NO and betulin production. Thus, the above data indicated
   that Put-induced NO was essential for betulin production. NO derived
   from NR, NOS, and NH4+ mediated betulin production in birch suspension
   cell cultures under Put treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The shear characteristics of stacked soilbags are related to their
   interlayer arrangements and the properties of the materials with which
   the bags (geosynthetics) are filled. To study the effects of those
   factors on the shear strength and failure mode of stacked soilbags, a
   series of shear tests were conducted. The results show that although the
   shear failure surface occurred at the horizontal interface between
   soilbags when they were stacked vertically, it was ladder-like when the
   soilbags were stacked in a staggered manner. The angle of insertion was
   found to govern the shape of the shear failure surface and, thus, the
   final shear strength of soilbags stacked in a staggered manner. Two
   shear failure modes of the stacked soilbags were observed with different
   infilled materials. When the frictional resistance of the contact
   interface was smaller than the shear strength of the materials with
   which the bags was filled, only interlayer sliding failure occurred.
   Otherwise, the simple shear failure of materials filling the bags
   occurred first, followed by interlayer sliding failure.}},

Title = {{Household air pollution exposure and associations with household
   characteristics among biomass cookstove users in Puno, Peru}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{191}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Household air pollution (HAP) from combustion of biomass
   fuel, such as wood and animal dung, is among the leading environmental
   risk factors for preventable disease. Close to half of the world's
   population relies on biomass cookstoves for their daily cooking needs.
   Understanding factors that affect HAP can inform measures to maximize
   the effectiveness of cookstove interventions in a cost-effective manner.
   However, the impact of kitchen and household characteristics, as well as
   the presence of secondary stoves, on HAP concentrations is poorly
   understood in Puno, Peru.
   Objective: To explore how household characteristics explain variability
   of kitchen area concentrations and personal exposures to CO, PM2.5 and
   BC from biomass cookstoves among women in rural Peru.
   Methods: Household characteristics (including kitchen materials and
   layout, wealth, and cooking behaviors) and HAP measurements were
   collected from 180 households in Puno, Peru, from baseline measurements
   of a randomized trial. Kitchen area concentrations and personal
   exposures to carbon monoxide (CO), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and
   black carbon (BC) were sampled for 48 h. We implemented simple and
   multivariable linear regression models to determine the associations
   between household characteristics and both kitchen area concentration
   and personal exposure to each pollutant.
   Results: Mean daily kitchen area concentrations and personal exposures
   to HAP were, on average, 48 times above World Health Organization indoor
   guidelines for PM2.5. We found that roof type explained the most
   variability in HAP and was strongly associated with both kitchen area
   concentrations and personal exposures for all pollutants after adjusting
   for other household variables. Personal exposures were 27\%-36\% lower
   for PM2.5, CO and BC, in households with corrugated metal roofs,
   compared to roofs made of natural materials (straw, totora or reed)
   after adjusting for other factors. Higher kitchen area concentrations
   were also associated with less wealth, owning more animals, or sampling
   during the dry season in multivariable models. Having a liquefied
   petroleum gas (LPG) stove and having a chimney were associated with
   lower personal exposures, but were not associated with kitchen area
   concentrations. Personal exposures were lower by 21\% for PM2.5 and 28\%
   for CO and BC concentrations among participants who had both LPG and
   biomass stoves compared to those with only biomass cookstoves adjusting
   for other household factors.
   Conclusions: Characterizing HAP within different settings can help
   identify effective and culturally-relevant solutions to reduce HAP
   exposures. We found that housing roof type is strongly related to
   kitchen area concentrations and personal exposures to HAP, perhaps
   because of greater ventilation in kitchens with metal roofs compared to
   those with thatch roofs. Although HAP concentrations remained above
   guidelines for all households, promoting use of metal roof materials and
   LPG stoves may be actionable interventions that can help reduce
   exposures to HAP in high-altitude rural Peru and similar settings.}},

Title = {{Mechanism of autophagy regulating chemoresistance in esophageal cancer
   cells}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The current study aimed to explore the mechanism of autophagy-regulating
   chemoresistance in esophageal cancer (EC) cells. Methods: 45 cases of
   esophageal cancer cell tissue and 25 cases of adjacent normal tissue
   excised in the surgical resection were collected from the tumor
   pathology department of our hospital from March to November 2017. The
   above cancer cells and paracancerous cells were cultured according to
   the cell culture procedures. The autophagy was induced by cisplatin in
   human esophageal cancer EC9706 cells line. The effect of autophagy on
   the survival of EC9706 cells was observed by autophagy inhibitor 3-MA.
   Cell viability was also measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8).
   Apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry. Furthermore,
   monodansylcadaverine (MDC) was used to detect autophagy. Western blot
   was applied to determine the molecular changes during treatment.
   Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is able to inhibit cell proliferation, induce
   cell death and cell cycle arrest in the S phase. In addition, autophagy
   was activated through PI3K-III pathway. Results: 3-MA inhibitor plus
   10\% fetal bovine serum were added for culture, and the cell culture
   temperature and humidity were the best conditions. There were few
   autophagic vesicles in the stationary cells, where their brightness was
   weakened. There were more and brighter green fluorescent particles in
   the DPP group without a 3-MA inhibitor, indicating that autophagic
   parameters actually exist in this process. The apoptosis rate of
   DDPinduced cell death was not found to be the best, but was higher than
   that of the control group (P<0.05). The combination of DDP and 3-MA had
   a more obvious catalytic effect on apoptosis, and the apoptosis rate was
   much higher than that of single DDP (P<0.05), indicating that DDP was
   capable of inducing significant apoptosis after inhibiting autophagy.
   The combination of DDP and 3-MA had an obvious catalytic effect on
   apoptosis, and the apoptosis rate was higher than that of DDP alone (P <
   0.05), suggesting that DDP could significantly improve the ability to
   induce apoptosis after inhibiting autophagy. The expression level of
   autophagy-related proteins was also detected by Western blotting. Our
   findings indicated that autophagy may be a self-protective mechanism of
   esophageal cancer cells induced by DDP, and its inhibition may be a new
   strategy for adjuvant chemotherapy in esophageal cancer.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common critical illness in
   clinic, which seriously threatens the life of patients. The aim of this
   study was to validate the anti-apoptotic effect of hydroxytyrosol (HT)
   in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced AKI.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cell model of AKI was established by
   hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), and the animal model of AKI was established
   by I/R. The apoptosis was observed by Caspase-3 activity assay, flow
   cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP
   nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Cell viability was detected by cell
   counting kit8 (CCK-8) assay. Protein expression was measured by Western
   blot and mRNA level was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase
   chain reaction (RT-PCR). Renal function was assessed by measuring serum
   creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).
   RESULTS: H/R induced apoptosis of HK-2 cells and reduced cell viability.
   When HK-2 cells were pretreated with HT, apoptosis was markedly
   inhibited. and cell viability was greatly increased. In addition, HT
   could inhibit I/R-induced apoptosis of rat kidney cells and could
   notably improve rat kidney function. H/R promoted Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)
   expression in HK-2 cells, while HT treatment further enhanced SHH
   expression. Similarly, I/R induces SHH expression in kidney tissue, and
   HT could further promote SHH expression.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that HT could inhibit apoptosis in
   I/R-induced AKI via activating SHH signaling pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Current cruise ships need to accommodate thousands of tourists for
   weeks' navigation, thus resulting in a large amount of thermal and
   electric power demands, simultaneously. To satisfy those great power
   demands and improve the energy efficiency, heterogeneous energy storage
   (HES), including both the battery and the thermal storage tank, is
   integrated and makes the future cruise ship as a ``moving multienergy
   microgrid.{''} Compared with the conventional commercial ships, cruise
   ships have much stricter quality of service requirements of thermal load
   demand to satisfy the comfort levels of tourists, i.e., indoor
   temperature and hot water supply. In this sense, a two-stage
   thermal-electric HES operation method is developed, where the first
   stage for the hourly electric load and the second stage for the
   20-minute thermal load. The case study on a real-world cruise ship
   voyage shows that the HES operation on multienergy cruise ships can
   achieve remarkable energy efficiency improvement.}},

Journal = {{KIDNEY \& BLOOD PRESSURE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{45}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have illustrated clinical associations
   between diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and diabetic kidney disease
   (DKD). Quantitative sensory testing (QST) can accurately detect thermal
   perception abnormalities and aid in the early diagnosis of asymptomatic
   small-fiber DPN in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study
   was to determine the predictive value of thermal perception
   abnormalities by QST to detect DKD. Methods: We prospectively enrolled
   432 patients with type 2 diabetes (50.2\% male, mean age 57.2 years, and
   average duration of diabetes 9.9 years) at our hospital between 2016 and
   2017. Demographic and clinical data of the patients were recorded and
   analyzed. Diagnosis and staging of DKD were determined by urinary
   albumin excretion rate and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The
   presence of thermal perception abnormalities was determined by QST.
   Multiple logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   analyses were performed to investigate the relationships between thermal
   perception abnormalities and DKD in these patients. Results: In multiple
   regression analysis, abnormal cold perception in the lower limbs was
   associated with an increased risk of advanced DKD. Area under the ROC
   curve analysis revealed that four-limb cold perception abnormalities had
   the best discriminatory power (0.741 +/- 0.053) to predict advanced DKD.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the value of using thermal
   perception abnormalities to identify patients with type 2 diabetes also
   at risk of DKD.}},

   case study of the El Gilf El Kiber area, Egypt}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{The El Gilf El Kiber area is one of the most promising areas for urban
   growth and reclamation projects in the southwest of Egypt. In the study
   area, the lithological units vary in age from Precambrian (mainly
   granite) to Quaternary (mainly sand sediments). The analysis of airborne
   magnetic and gamma-my spectrometry data was incorporated into that of
   the remote sensing data (Landsat-8). The integrated analysis was used to
   detect the Ethological distributions and to delineate the subsurface
   basement rocks that control the radioactivity in the study area. It was
   also used to determine the relationship between radiogenic heat
   production (RHP) and land surface temperature (LSI') that was retrieved
   from the Landsat-8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) data. The output of
   the principal component analysis (PCA) of Landsat-8 Operational Land
   Imager (OLI) data is a false-color map (PC1, PC2, and PC3 as red, green,
   and blue, respectively) displaying the various lithological units in the
   study area. The LST map, calculated from Landsat-8 TIRS data, shows that
   the surface temperatures range from approximately 41 to 53 degrees C.
   The highest concentrations of eU, eTh, and K in the area were 25 ppm,
   121 ppm, and 7.8\%, respectively. The RHP values ranged from 1.1 mu
   W/m(3) to 15.1 mu W/m(3). These relatively high anomalies are associated
   with basement outcrops and the sedimentary rocks overlying shallow
   basement rocks. The total horizontal derivative (THD) of the magnetic
   data delineates the horizontal extension of the basement rocks. The
   Curie point depth (CPD), estimated from magnetic data, ranges from 35.5
   km to 41.0 km. The results also exhibited geothermal gradients ranging
   from 16.10-degrees C/km to 14.14 degrees C/km, and heat flow ranges from
   35.4 mW/m(2) to 40.8 mW/m(2). It was evident after comparing that the
   BHP and 1ST maps exhibited the same features as the gamma-ray
   spectrometric maps. Moreover, the areas around the basement rocks
   exhibited higher radioactivity, RHP, and temperature than the basement
   rocks themselves.}},

Abstract = {{Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
   the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that
   emerged as a health problem worldwide. It seems that COVID-19 is more
   lethal for Iranian veterans with a history of exposure to mustard gas.
   There are some similarities in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and
   mustard gas in immune system disruption and pulmonary infection.
   SARS-CoV-2 and mustard gas inducing oxidative stress, immune system
   dysregulation, cytokine storm, and overexpression of
   angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor in lungs that act as
   functional entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, Iranian survivors
   of mustard gas exposure are more susceptible and vulnerable to COVID-19.
   It is suggested that the principles of COVID-19 infection prevention and
   control be adhered to more stringently in Iranian survivors of mustard
   gas exposure than others who have not been exposed to mustard gas.
   Therefore, in this review, we discuss the different pathologic aspects
   of lung injury caused by mustard gas and also the relationship between
   this damage and the increased susceptibility of Iranian mustard gas

Abstract = {{Vaccine design strategies against severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are focused on the Spike protein or its
   subunits as the main antigen target of neutralizing antibodies. In this
   work, we propose rapid production methods of an extended segment of the
   Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in HEK293SF cells cultured in
   suspension, in serum-free media, as a major component of a COVID-19
   subunit vaccine under development. The expression of RBD, engineered
   with a sortase-recognition motif for protein-based carrier coupling, was
   achieved at high yields by plasmid transient transfection or human
   type-5-adenoviral infection of the cells, in a period of only two and
   three weeks, respectively. Both production methods were evaluated in
   3L-controlled bioreactors with upstream and downstream bioprocess
   improvements, resulting in a product recovery with over 95\% purity.
   Adenoviral infection led to over 100 mu g/mL of RBD in culture
   supernatants, which was around 7-fold higher than levels obtained in
   transfected cultures. The monosaccharide and sialic acid content was
   similar in the RBD protein from the two production approaches. It also
   exhibited a proper conformational structure as recognized by monoclonal
   antibodies directed against key native Spike epitopes. Efficient direct
   binding to ACE2 was also demonstrated at similar levels in RBD obtained
   from both methods and from different production lots. Overall, we
   provide bioprocess-related data for the rapid, scalable manufacturing of
   low cost RBD based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, with the added value of
   making a functional antigen available to support further research on
   uncovering mechanisms of virus binding and entry as well as screening
   for potential COVID-19 therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{In electron microscopy, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability rule
   has been introduced as a tool to determine the most probable atomic
   structure from high-resolution annular dark-field (ADF) scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images exhibiting low
   contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Besides ADF imaging, STEM can also be
   applied in the annular bright-field (ABF) regime. The ABF STEM mode
   allows to directly visualize light-element atomic columns in the
   presence of heavy columns. Typically, light-element nanomaterials are
   sensitive to the electron beam, limiting the incoming electron dose in
   order to avoid beam damage and leading to images exhibiting low CNR.
   Therefore, it is of interest to apply the MAP probability rule not only
   to ADF STEM images, but to ABF STEM images as well. In this work, the
   methodology of the MAP rule, which combines statistical parameter
   estimation theory and model-order selection, is extended to be applied
   to simultaneously acquired ABF and ADF STEM images. For this, an
   extension of the commonly used parametric models in STEM is proposed.
   Hereby, the effect of specimen tilt has been taken into account, since
   small tilts from the crystal zone axis affect, especially, ABF STEM
   intensities. Using simulations as well as experimental data, it is shown
   that the proposed methodology can be successfully used to detect light
   elements in the presence of heavy elements.}},

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Structural integrity monitoring of jacket structures is an attractive
   challenge faced by researchers worldwide. Because of numerous
   uncertainties in marine environments, using statistical methods to
   reduce the detrimental impacts of uncertainties on model updating and
   damage detection results are unavoidable. In this study, a new Bayesian
   model updating framework is proposed using incomplete Frequency Response
   Function (FRF) data. In this methodology, the incomplete measurements
   issue is not dealt with the model reduction or data expansion method and
   the number of data in the objective function is increased using FRF at
   different excitation frequencies. The experimental verification of a
   scale 2D fixed platform is implemented to reveal the validity of the
   proposed methodology. Several numerical damage scenarios are simulated
   to investigate the effect of noisy data, FE model uncertainties,
   incomplete measurement, and added mass in the damage detection
   procedure. According to the results, the introduced method is entirely
   successful in the model updating and damage detection of the jacket
   platform. The results also indicate the lower effects of uncertainties
   and noise levels in damage detection outcomes.}},

   including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and
   post-transcriptional modulations through non-coding RNAs fluctuations as
   well as H. pylori and Epstein-Barr virus infections. Finally, we

Abstract = {{Intermolecular C(sp(3))-H bond functionalization reactions promise to
   revolutionize how we synthesize organic molecules by enabling the
   introduction of functionality at previously inert sites. However, one of
   the greatest challenges in this research field is site-selectivity,
   wherein chosen C(sp(3))-H bonds must be selectively functionalized and
   other C(sp(3))-H bonds with similar stereoelectronic properties must
   remain intact. To address this problem, chemists have developed methods
   that rely on targeting innately more reactive C(sp(3))-H bonds or on
   using pre-installed functional groups to direct a catalyst or reagent to
   a particular C(sp(3))-H bond. However, such approaches invariably have
   limited applicability because only a handful of innately reactive
   C(sp(3))-H bonds or those nearby certain functional groups can be
   functionalized with good site-selectivity. To overcome these
   limitations, chemists also have developed catalysts and reagents that
   control the site of C(sp(3))-H bond functionalization and have begun to
   unlock the potential of these reactions to achieve the site-divergent
   functionalization of C(sp(3))-H bonds, wherein the site of
   functionalization is changed by modulating the stereoelectronic
   properties of the catalyst or reagent. This short review will provide a
   summary of selected examples of catalyst- and reagent-controlled
   site-divergent intermolecular functionalization of C(sp(3))-H bonds, the
   factors responsible for modulating the site selectivity of these
   reactions, and will identify potential areas worthy of future research
   in this field.}},

Abstract = {{The present work is devoted to studying the regularized trace formulae
   for symmetric L-0-compact perturbations of a self-adjoint lower
   semi-bounded operator L-0 with a discrete spectrum in a separable
   Hilbert space. By now, the studies of the regularized trace formulae for
   the perturbations of abstract self-adjoint discrete operators were
   mostly aimed on finding a sufficient condition, under which the
   regularized sum with brackets minus first or several leading terms of
   the perturbation theory vanished. This condition was formulated in terms
   of spectral characteristics of an unperturbed operator L-0 depending on
   the belonging of a perturbing operator V to some class. In particular,
   recently, the traces formulae for model two-dimensional operators in
   mathematical physics have been intensively studied with a perturbation
   described by the multiplication operator. Here we study a necessary and
   sufficient condition for two cases, namely, as the regularized trace
   with brackets and deduction of the first corrector of the perturbation
   theory vanishes or is equal to a finite number. We consider a certain
   summation bracket, which usually arises in the theory of regularized
   traces of the perturbations of partial differential operators.}},

Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Problem-solving courts and restorative justice programs provide
   important new alternatives to cope with recurring problems in the
   criminal justice process. But they are much more. They are harbingers of
   a new theory of the criminal justice process that challenges traditional
   accounts in fundamental ways. Although practices akin to problem-solving
   courts and restorative justice have long operated outside or below the
   radar of the theory of criminal law and the adjudicative process, over
   the past few decades these practices have come to the fore and are now
   supported with full-blown theories, which threaten to displace
   traditional accounts of criminal responsibility, criminal liability, and
   indeed the core features of the criminal justice process. The new
   theories are based on theories of regulation, where the objective is not
   so much to enforce the law as it is to secure compliance to the law in
   order to facilitate harm reduction and restore social order. Nowhere is
   this new development so clearly seen as in the opening chapters of John
   Braithwaite's important book, Restorative Justice and Responsive
   Regulation. In this book, Braithwaite offers a full-throated theory of
   the new criminal justice process that is based on recent developments in
   regulatory theory and, most particularly, responsive regulation, which
   Braithwaite helped to develop. This model is implicit to varying degrees
   in any number of recent developments in the criminal justice process,
   and in this paper, I argue it has the potential for displacing the
   classical theory of criminal law.}},

Abstract = {{Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) is an unknown hereditary disorder
   with variable penetrance. The characterizations of this disease consist
   of different signs and symptoms such as multiple tumorous (tumor-like)
   muco-cutaneous proliferation, gingival hypertrophy, perianal lesions,
   articular contractures, and osteolytic lesions. A 3-year-old girl with
   numerous painless nodular masses on her gingival, ear and anal areas is
   presented in this case report. Based on characteristic histological
   features, the diagnosis of JHF was made. The patient underwent surgery
   following general anesthesia and the above areas were surgically
   operated with appropriate laser parameters, and the patient was able to
   eat and wash away after a day and was discharged with an antibiotic
   prescription after one day in the hospital and returned to normal after
   a week. The recurrence occurred in other areas a year later, especially
   in the cheek, the ears and the anal area. Therefore, this rare case is
   presented with recurrence.}},

Abstract = {{Since the emission of greenhouse gases is an important environment
   issue, this paper presents an analysis of CO2 emissions between two
   different building methodologies: conventional masonry and light steel
   frame. To this end, a 70m(2) building project used in Social Brazilian
   Housing Programs (SBHP) built according to both methods was analyzed. In
   addition to that, the quantitative materials used were determined,
   according to the building services (infrastructure, superstructure,
   closing and cladding, roof and floor) and afterwards, were multiplied by
   conversion factors. These conversion factors allow estimating the CO2
   emission from the manufacturing process of the material up to its
   application, which made it possible to determine the total CO2 emission
   for both building methodologies. Furthermore, a cost analysis was
   carried out in order to interpret economic issues in both methods. The
   results showed that infrastructure and superstructure are the main
   services responsible for CO2 emission in both constructive
   methodologies, due to the high consumption of concrete, steel, coarse
   aggregates and wood, where differences of almost 90\% were identified.
   Moreover, although the conventional masonry method presented low global
   cost in comparison with light steel frame, this method emits more than
   102\% of CO2 in relation to the latter. Therefore, from an environmental
   point of view, builders should consider this issue when choosing a
   construction system.}},

Abstract = {{Atomically-defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are narrow strips
   of graphene that feature a quantum confinement-induced bandgap, have
   shown great promise for applications in the next generation of
   semiconductor devices. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the
   bottom-up synthesis of all-carbon GNRs, a comparatively limited number
   of reports have focused on the preparation of nitrogen-doped GNRs, with
   two general types of architectures demonstrated to date. Herein, we
   describe the design, synthesis, and characterization of a new class of
   nitrogen-containing GNRs consisting of repeating tetrabenzopentacene
   molecular subunits. Our findings may afford additional possibilities and
   opportunities with regard to the directed bottom-up synthesis of
   heteroatom-doped, carbon-based nanoscale electronics. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Night Shift Among Women: Is It Associated With Difficulty Conceiving a
   First Birth?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Asynchrony in circadian processes alters many physiological
   systems, including female reproduction. Thus, there are possible
   reproductive consequences of night shift work for women including
   menstrual irregularity, endometriosis, and prolonged time to conception.
   This study examined whether women who worked night shift were more
   likely than those who did not to require fertility treatment to conceive
   a first birth, whether they had specific infertility diagnoses, and if
   such relationships were age-specific.
   Methods: In a retrospective data linkage study of 128,852 primiparous
   women, fertility treatment data were linked to the state perinatal
   registry for South Australia (1986-2002). Potential exposure to night
   shift work was assessed using a job-exposure matrix. First, the
   association between night shift work and fertility treatment was
   assessed among (1) all women, then (2) women in paid employment, using
   logistic regression. Interactions between age and shift work status were
   also examined. Secondly, among women who conceived with fertility
   treatment, we assessed associations between night shift work and type of
   infertility diagnosis. Potential confounders were considered in all
   analyses.
   Results: Among women <= 35 years, night shift workers were more likely
   to require fertility treatment (all: OR = 1.40, 95\% CI 1.19-1.64; in
   paid employment: OR = 1.27, 95\% CI 1.08-1.50). There were no
   associations among women >35 years. Ethnicity, socioeconomic status and
   smoking did not affect these results. Among women who underwent
   fertility treatment, night shift workers were more likely than day
   workers to have menstrual irregularity (OR = 1.42, 95\% CI 1.05-1.91) or
   endometriosis (OR = 1.34, 95\% CI 1.00-1.80).
   Conclusions: Night shift work may contribute to increased need for
   fertility treatment in younger women. This increased risk may reflect
   young women's vulnerability in terms of poor tolerance of night shift
   work, and/or lack of control and choice about shift schedule.}},

Abstract = {{Children with ADHD show significant deficits in response inhibition. A
   leading hypothesis suggests prefrontal hypoactivation as a possible
   cause, though, there is conflicting evidence. We tested the
   hypoactivation hypothesis by analyzing the response inhibition process
   within the oculomotor system. Twenty-two children diagnosed with ADHD
   and twenty control (CTRL) children performed the antisaccade task while
   undergoing an fMRI study with concurrent eye tracking. This task
   included a preparatory stage that cued a prosaccade (toward a stimuli)
   or an antisaccade (away from a stimuli) without an actual presentation
   of a peripheral target. This allowed testing inhibitory control without
   the confounding activation from an actual response. The ADHD group
   showed longer reaction times and more antisaccade direction errors.
   While both groups showed activations in saccade network areas, the ADHD
   showed significant hyperactivation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   during the preparatory stage. No other areas in the saccade network had
   significant activation differences between groups. Further ADHD group
   analysis OFF and ON stimulant medication did not show drug-related
   activation differences. However, they showed a significant correlation
   between the difference in OFF/ON preparatory activation in the
   precuneus, and a decrease in the number of antisaccade errors. These
   results do not support the hypoactivity hypothesis as an inhibitory
   control deficit general explanation, but instead suggest less efficiency
   during the inhibitory period of the antisaccade task in children. Our
   findings contrast with previous results in ADHD adults showing decreased
   preparatory antisaccade activity, suggesting a significant age-dependent
   maturation effect associated to the inhibitory response in the
   oculomotor system.}},

Abstract = {{Students with administrative protection records are the protagonists of
   most of the academic itineraries of school exclusion. The declaration of
   the state of alarm, motivated by the health alert of Covid-19, leads to
   a change in the school dynamics of the students. This research aims to
   analyze which aspects of educational planning, as well as the
   collaboration between teachers and professionals of the specific
   protection resources of Galicia during the state of alarm, have an
   impact on the inclusion or exclusion of students in social difficulty.
   Eleven longitudinal follow-ups are carried out with 11 adolescents, five
   boys and six girls. The study is based on the grounded theory with the
   intention of triangulating the discourses derived from the interviews
   with students and instrumental case studies involving 14 professionals.
   The sample of educational teams consists of 11 female educators and 3
   male educators. The results highlight that the dynamics of school
   inequality have increased during the period of the state of alarm,
   observing that the contact between students and teachers is reduced,
   which leads to deficits in the students' homework; and that the
   collaboration between the professionals in the protection system and the
   school is limited to timely exchanges of information. These results
   underline that, during the state of alarm motivated by the current
   health crisis, the school and education policies in Galicia neglect the
   situation of greater social difficulty of the students under protection.}},

Abstract = {{We describe through integrative taxonomy a new Amazonian species of
   leaf-litter toad of the Rhinella margaritifera species group. The new
   species inhabits open lowland forest in southwest Amazonia in Brazil,
   Peru, and Bolivia. It is closely related to a Bolivian species
   tentatively identified as Rhinella cf. paraguayensis. Both the new
   species and R. paraguayensis share an uncommon breeding strategy among
   their Amazonian congeners: each breeds in moderate to large rivers
   instead of small streams or ponds formed by rainwater. The new species
   is easily differentiated from other members of the R. margaritifera
   species group by having a strongly developed bony protrusion at the
   angle of the jaw, a snout-vent length of 63.4-84.7 mm in females and
   56.3-72.3 mm in males, well-developed supratympanic crests with the
   proximal portion shorter than the parotoid gland in lateral view, a
   divided distal subarticular tubercle on finger III, and multinoted calls
   composed of groups of 7-9 pulsed notes and a dominant frequency of
   1,012-1,163 Hz. Recent studies have shown that the upper Madeira Basin
   harbors a megadiverse fauna of anurans, including several candidate
   species. This is the first member of the R. margaritifera species group
   to be described from this region in recent years, and at least two
   additional unnamed species await formal description.}},

Abstract = {{Turbulent fluid flow data are often 4-D, spatially and temporally
   complex, and require specific techniques for visualization. Common
   visualization techniques neglect the temporal aspect of this data,
   limiting the ability to convey feature motion, or offering the user a
   complicated visualization. To remedy this, we present an
   approach-evolution surfaces-focused on the spatiotemporal rendering of
   user-selected flow features (i.e., vortices). By abstracting the spatial
   representation of these features, the approach renders their
   spatiotemporal behavior with reduced visual complexity. The behavior of
   vortex features is presented as surfaces, with textures indicating
   properties of motion and evolution events (e.g., bifurcation and
   amalgamation) represented by the surface topology. We evaluated the
   approach on two data sets generated from empirical measurement and
   computational simulation (Re = 28 000 and Re = 1200, respectively). Our
   approach's focus on handling evolution events makes it capable of
   visualizing higher Reynolds number (Re) flows than other surface-based
   techniques. This approach has been assessed by fluid dynamicists to
   assert the validity for flow analysis. Evolution surfaces offer a
   compact visualization of spatiotemporal vortex behaviors, opening
   potential avenues for exploration and analysis of fluid flows.}},

Title = {{Optimal Meter Placement in Low Observability Distribution Networks with
   DER}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{189}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach
   to deal with the volatility associated with loads and distributed energy
   resources (DER) in low observability distribution networks. Distribution
   networks, characterized by having many buses and few meters, have
   recently faced massive integration of DER, whose injection increases net
   load volatility. To better understand how to act under such increased
   volatility, the accuracy of state estimation (SE) needs to be improved.
   Our approach improves SE accuracy by providing meter placement solutions
   that take into account uncertainty as expressed by multiple load and DER
   profile scenarios, this way mitigating the impact of net load
   volatility. Solution results are illustrated and discussed for different
   case studies carried out over a radial 9 bus test feeder.}},

Abstract = {{Based on self-determination theory (SDT), the present study aimed to
   investigate whether adolescents' perception of autonomy support to adopt
   a healthy lifestyle from their class tutor, family, peers, and physical
   education teacher was related to adolescents' self-reported
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The role played by
   perceived basic psychological need satisfaction, novelty need
   satisfaction and self-determined motivation towards a healthy lifestyle
   was also analyzed. Two hundred and fifteen students (107 boys and 108
   girls) from elementary school, aged between 11 to 13 years old (M-age =
   11.35 years; SD = .51), answered different SDT-based measures and
   reported their MVPA. The results of the path analysis revealed that
   perceived autonomy support from tutor positively predicted novelty need
   satisfaction, while perceived autonomy support from peers positively
   predicted novelty need satisfaction and the construct of basic
   psychological need satisfaction. In turn, both need satisfactions
   positively predicted self-determined motivation. Perceived autonomy
   support from peers also positively and directly predicted MVPA in
   leisure time. This work provides evidence of the contribution of novelty
   need satisfaction as a construct of SDT and the importance of involving
   social agents of the educational community to promote MVPA.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation rests not only on discovery but also on cooperation and
   interactive learning. In agriculture, forestry and related sectors,
   multi-actor partnerships for `co-innovation' occur in many forms, from
   international projects to informal `actor configurations'. Common
   attributes are that they include actors with `complementary forms of
   knowledge' who collaborate in an innovation process, engage with a
   `larger periphery' of stakeholders in the Agricultural Knowledge and
   Innovation System (AKIS) and are shaped by institutions. Using desk
   research and interviews, we reviewed, according to the Organisational
   Innovation Systems framework, the performance of 200 co-innovation
   partnerships from across Europe, selected for their involvement of
   various actors `all along the process'. Many of the reviewed
   partnerships were composed of actors that had previously worked together
   and most interviewees believed that no relevant actors had been
   excluded. In almost all cases, project targets and objectives were
   co-designed to a great or some extent, and the mechanisms applied to
   foster knowledge sharing between partners were considered to be very
   effective. Great importance was attached to communication beyond the
   partnership, not simply for dissemination but also for dialogue, and
   most interviewees evaluated the communication/outreach performance of
   their partnership very highly. Most partnerships received external
   funding, most did not use innovation brokers during the proposal writing
   process and two thirds had access to information they needed. We discuss
   the implications of these findings and question whether the AKIS concept
   as currently interpreted by many policy makers can adequately account
   for the regional differences encountered by co-innovation partnerships
   across Europe.}},

Abstract = {{In 2000, Figallo and Sanza introduced n x m-valued Lukasiewicz-Moisil
   algebras which are both a particular case of matrix Lukasiewicz algebras
   {[}W. Suchon, Matrix Lukasiewicz Algebras, Rep. Math. Logic 4 (1975)
   91-104] and a generalization of n-valued Lukasiewicz-Moisil algebras. It
   is worth noting that unlike what happens in n-valued Lukasiewicz-Moisil
   algebras, generally the De Morgan reducts of n x m-valued
   Lukasiewicz-Moisil algebras are not Kleene algebras. Furthermore, in
   {[}C. Sanza, n x m-valued Lukasiewicz algebras with negation, Rep. Math.
   Logic 40 (2006) 83-106] an important example which legitimated the study
   of this class of algebras is provided.
   In this paper, we continue the study of n x m-valued Lukasiewicz-Moisil
   algebras (or LMnxm-algebras). More precisely, we determine a new
   topological duality for these algebras. By means of this duality we
   characterize the congruences and specially the maximal congruences on
   LMnxm-algebras. Then these characterizations allow us to assert that
   LMnxm-algebras are semisimples and obtain a new description of
   subdirectly irreducible LMnxm-algebras.}},

Abstract = {{The present article explores from 2 experiences of intercultural
   education the limits of ethnic essentialism and the epistemological and
   political possibilities that the recognition of educational proposals
   close to popular republicanism of indigenous matrix would have for
   overcoming these limits. Based on the contrast between the process of
   evaluation and closure of the Intercultural University of Peoples and
   Nationalities Amawtay Wasi, -now UINPI-, and the social history of the
   Intercultural Institute Quilloac, it is argued that the visibility of
   the republican traditions of the sectors marginalized by racial,
   economic or gender reasons, constitutes an alternative to the ethnic
   essentialism characteristic of the ethnoeducation proposals dominated by
   neoliberalism and postmodernism and constitutes a key piece in the
   construction of a plurinational state. In the case of the Quilloac
   Institute, republican traditions are visible in the articulation made by
   indigenous people between the fight against the hacienda and demands for
   relevant and quality intercultural education. In this context, the
   struggle for education questioned the legacies of the landowning
   domination and legitimized a series of claims that, at the same time
   that they defended the specificities of peoples and nationalities,
   demanded for a democratic insertion of indigenous people into national
   society. As we will see, the struggle resorted to a popular radical
   democratic capital, typical of republican traditions..}},

Title = {{Polyethylene glycol-mediated blocking and monolayer morphology of an

   serum}},
Journal = {{BIOELECTROCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{136}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Better approaches are critically needed for in situ point-of-care
   diagnostic biosensors that enable primary care physicians, or even
   individual patients, to directly analyze biological fluids without
   complicated sample pretreatments. Additional purification steps consume
   time, consume reagents, often require other equipment, and can introduce
   false-negative results. Biosensors have been modified with blocking
   molecules to reduce biofouling; however, the effectiveness relies on
   their chemical composition and morphology. Here, we used a polyethylene
   glycol film to suppress unspecific binding from human serum on an
   electrochemical malaria aptasensor. A detailed study of the variation of
   the chemical and morphological composition of the aptamer/polyethylene
   glycol mixed monolayer as a function of incubation time was conducted.
   Higher resistance to matrix biofouling was found for polyethylene glycol
   than for hydrophobic alkanethiol films. The best sensor performance was
   observed for intermediate polyethylene glycol immobilization times. With
   prolonged incubation, phase separation of aptamer, and polyethylene
   glycol molecules locally increased the aptamer density and thereby
   diminished the analyte binding capability. Remarkably, polyethylene
   glycols do not affect the aptasensor sensitivity but enhance the complex
   matrix tolerance, the dynamic range, and the limit of detection. Careful
   tuning of the blocking molecule immobilization is crucial to achieving
   high aptasensor performance and biofouling resistance. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{One of the most spectacular paintings in the history of art is The
   Scream by Edvard Munch. What could be the background for this tormented
   face? Munch himself describes an episode when the ``sky suddenly turned
   bloody red ... Ifelt as though a vast, endless scream passed through
   nature{''}. He talked about this to a painter colleague who later wrote
   ``He yearns for the impossible and has despair as his religion ... but
   advised him to paint it And he painted his peculiar Scream{''}. In this
   article we describe an irregular, but often very spectacular cloud
   phenomenon, called nacreous clouds or mother-of-pearl clouds, occurring
   after sunset in the stratosphere 18 to 30 km above the earth's surface
   near Polar Regions, and how this could have influenced the sensitive
   mind of a young man. We also find that an earlier hypothesis based on
   volcanic dust from the Krakatau eruption cannot be valid.}},

Journal = {{BIOMEDICINES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to investigate the role of positron emission computed
   tomography (PET/CT) with F-18-choline for predicting the outcome of
   metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) submitted to
   treatment with Radium-223 (Ra-223-therapy). Clinical records of 20 mCRPC
   patients submitted to PET/CT with F-18-choline before Ra-223-therapy
   were retrospectively evaluated. The following PET-derived parameters
   were calculated: number of lesions, maximum and mean standardized uptake
   values (SUVmax, SUVmean), lean body mass corrected SUV peak (SULpeak),
   metabolic tumor volume (MATV), and total lesion activity (TLA). After
   Ra-223-therapy, all patients underwent regular follow-up until death.
   The predictive power of clinical and PET-derived parameters on overall
   survival (OS) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox
   proportional hazard method. All the patients showed F-18-choline-avid
   lesions at baseline PET/CT. Among the enrolled subjects, eleven (55\%)
   completed all the six scheduled cycles of Ra-223-therapy; seven (35\%)
   were responders according to imaging and biochemical parameters. Mean OS
   was 12.7 +/- 1.4 months: by Kaplan-Meier analysis, number of lesions,
   PSA level and TLA were significantly correlated with OS. In multivariate
   Cox analysis, TLA remained the only significant predictor of survival (p
   = 0.003; hazard ratio = 7.6, 95\% confidence interval = 1.9-29.5
   months). F-18-choline PET may be useful for patients' stratification
   before Ra-223-therapy. In particular, high metabolically active tumor
   burden (i.e., TLA) was predictive of poor outcome.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN GENETICS \& DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{144-150}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{During development, individual neurons extend highly branched arbors
   that innervate the surrounding territory, enabling the formation of
   appropriate synaptic connections. The clustered protocadherins (cPCDH),
   a family of diverse cell-surface homophilic proteins, provide each
   neuron with a cell specific identity required for distinguishing between
   self versus non-self. While only 52 unique cPcdh isoforms are encoded in
   the human genome, a combination of stochastic promoter choice and the
   formation of a protein lattice through engagement of adjacent cPCDH
   protein cis/trans-tetramers confer the high degree of cellular
   specificity required for self-recognition. Studies of mice bearing
   deletions of individual cPcdh gene clustees have identified deficits in
   circuit formation and behavior. In humans, single nucleotide variants
   scattered across the cPCDH locus have been identified, which associate
   with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and
   schizophrenia. To advance our understanding of cPCDH stochastic choice
   and maintenance, function across cell types, and contribution to
   neuropsychiatric disease pathogenesis, hiPSC-based models have been
   developed. Ultimately, integration of human genetic data, biochemical
   assays, and functional studies is needed to uncover the mechanism
   underlying neurite repulsion, which has been implicated in
   neurodevelopmental disorders.}},

Abstract = {{When a potentially nuisance and risk-producing site is planned in a
   territory, very often a part of the population expresses its opposition.
   This is particularly the case for sustainable energy production sites
   (wind farms, methanizers, etc.). This inhabitants' refusal to see their
   immediate environment disturbed is generally called NIMBY Syndrome.
   However, many social scientists refuse this qualification they consider
   stigmatizing for residents. They prefer to see the refusal of these new
   sites as an resistance act, folowing a insufficiently concerted decision
   and/or too favorable to the the firm who carries the project. This
   article aims to show that the term `nimbyst' can be used to describe the
   inhabitants opposing the project without stigmatizing them. It also
   wants to show that notion of social acceptability can be used in this
   kind of context while remaining at a distance from the interests of the
   different actors, i.e., axiologically neutral.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of pharmacological disruption of fear memory

   applied nefiratecam and mifepristone to strongly conditioned, 1-wk-old
   contextual fear memories in male rats. Unexpectedly, the combined
   treatment did not result in impairment of contextual fear expression.
   However, mifepristone did reduce freezing to a novel context. These
   observations suggest that strong and established contextual fear
   memories do undergo destabilization without the need for pharmacological
   facilitation, and that impairments in strong context fear memory
   reconsolidation can manifest as a reduction in generalization.}},

Abstract = {{These are indeed exceptional and historic times, a global pandemic and
   public health emergency sitting side by side with heightened public
   awareness of the injustices of decades of institutional racism. This
   article considers the current pandemic and lockdown period through a
   VUCA lens and offers reflection on how the pandemic revealed the
   fragility of digitally immature organisations. VUCA, a managerial
   catchall acronym for Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity
   is a litmus test for recognising unpredictable external environments. We
   offer business leaders a caveat, it is dangerous to ignore the impact of
   VUCA on the smooth functioning of an organisation. In terms of digital
   transformation during lockdown this article offers three key lessons
   that can so far be discerned from the pandemic period, firstly
   organisations must improve their digital maturity, secondly, less
   digitally mature organisations are more fragile and finally
   organisations with higher levels of digital maturity are generally more
   flexible.}},

Title = {{Comparison between Specialized Quadrature Rules for Method of Moments
   with NURBS Modelling Applied to Periodic Multilayer Structures}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A comparison between Ma-Rokhlin-Wandzura (MRW) and double exponential
   (DE) quadrature rules for numerical integration of method of moments
   (MoM) matrix entries with singular behavior is presented for multilayer
   periodic structures. Non Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) modelling of
   the layout surfaces is implemented to provide high-order description of
   the geometry. The comparison is carried out in order to show that
   quadrature rule is more suitable for MoM matrix computation in terms of
   sampling, accuracy of computation of MoM matrix, and CPU time
   consumption. The comparison of CPU time consumption shows that the
   numerical integration with MRW samples is roughly 15 times faster than
   that numerical integration using DE samples for results with similar
   accuracies. These promising results encourage to carry out a comparison
   with results obtained in previous works where a specialized approach for
   the specific analysis of split rings geometries was carried out. This
   previous approach uses spectral MoM version with specific entire domain
   basis function with edge singularities defined on split ring geometry.
   Thus, the previous approach provides accurate results with low CPU time
   consumption to be compared. The comparison shows that CPU time
   consumption obtained by MRW samples is similar to the CPU time
   consumption required by the previous work of specific analysis of split
   rings geometries. The fact that similar CPU time consumptions are
   obtained by MRW quadrature rules for modelling of general planar
   geometries and by the specialized approach for split ring geometry
   provides an assessment for the usage of the MRW quadrature rules and
   NURBS modelling. This fact provides an efficient tool for analysis of
   reflectarray elements with general planar layout geometries, which is
   suitable for reflectarray designs under local periodicity assumption
   where a huge number of periodic multilayer structures have to be
   analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{LaMn1-xCoxO3 perovskites were synthesized by a modified sol-gel method
   which incorporates EDTA. These materials' electrochemical activity
   towards both oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER)
   was studied. The cobalt substitution level determines some
   physicochemical properties and, particularly, the surface concentration
   of Co and Mn's different oxidation states. As a result, the
   electroactivity of perovskite materials can be tuned using their
   composition. The presence of cobalt at low concentration influences the
   catalytic activity positively, and better bifunctionality is attained.
   As in other perovskites, their low electrical conductivity limits their
   applicability in electrochemical devices. It was found that the
   electrochemical performance improved significantly by physically mixing
   with a mortar the active materials with two different carbon black
   materials. The existence of a synergistic effect between the
   electroactive component and the carbon material was interpreted in light
   of the strong carbon-oxygen-metal interaction. Some mixed samples are
   promising electrocatalysts towards both ORR and OER.}},

Title = {{Quantitative assessment of the probability of introducing bovine
   brucellosis into English cattle herds by imported live cattle}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL RISK ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A stochastic simulation model was developed to estimate the quarterly
   probability (PIntro) of introducing bovine brucellosis into English
   cattle herds, by at least one imported live cattle (potential carrier of
   Brucella abortus). The probability of spread after introduction was not
   included and imports from several countries were considered. Information
   used to parameterise model's inputs was obtained from the literature,
   legislation and analysis of several national datasets (2013 to 2016),
   which contained information on imported cattle and testing schemes used
   in the English cattle population. Exporting countries were divided
   according to official brucellosis status ``J{''} into: Officially
   Brucellosis Free (OBF), Non-Officially Brucellosis Free (Non-OBF) and in
   OBF-Validation (during the first five years of OBF status). The entire
   English cattle population was divided into eight strata ``S{''} by
   combination of laboratory testing data and herd type. The only risk
   mitigation measure considered was the testing for antibodies on animals
   older than one year and imported from Non-OBF countries. Probabilities
   of introduction at herd and stratum level were combined into the overall
   national PIntro. Two scenarios were run. In the baseline scenario, the
   between herds prevalence BHP(OBF) in OBF countries was set according to
   information from EFSA and from the EU legislation. In the alternative
   scenario only the former was used and BHP(OBF) was set very
   low/negligible. For Non-OBF and OBF-Validation countries, the BHP was
   set with distributions based on the literature. In the baseline
   scenario, between 2013 and 2016, the quarterly median PIntro ranged from
   1.3\% to 5.5\%. For the last year considered, the median of the
   quarterly medians PIntro was 2.8\% (median of 5th percentiles = 0.4\%;
   median of 95th percentiles =10.7\%). Therefore, on average, at least one
   introduction could be expected each (approximated) 36 surveillance
   periods (9, 281), so each approximate to 9 years (2; 70). According to
   the alternative scenario, the PIntro was very low and on average at
   least one introduction could be expected each approximate to 125 years.}},

Journal = {{REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1284-1297}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in protected forests
   is a challenge, due to high costs and legal restrictions for direct
   assessments, and also to frequently weak estimation provided by general
   AGB equations. Objective: We propose a new approach that uses dead
   fallen trees (DFTs) to improve AGB estimation. We aim to analyse if the
   adjustment of allometric models based on DFTs provides a suitable local
   equation for AGB estimation or helps to validate existing pantropical or
   regional allometric equations. Methods: The study was carried out at the
   Dois Innlios State Park (PEDI), Pernambuco. Northeast Brazil. Along 4
   000 m, using the line intersect technique, we sampled 37 recent dead
   fallen trees ranging from 7.6 to 92.3 cm in diameter and from 8.6 to
   29.4 m in height. Nine models were adjusted, and the best equation
   (local) was compared to regional and pantropical equations. Results: One
   equation (AGB(kg) = 1.5292{*} DBH2.0601{*}TH-0.2187) produced biomass
   estimates which did not differ from the observed values (P > 0.05).
   Differently from the others, this equation overestimated AGB in only 2.8
   \% and, along with other parameters of analysis (R(adj )(2)and Syx \%)
   had the best overall performance. Analysing the performance of the local
   equation versus available equations for estimating AGB, we found that
   only the local and the pantropical equations by Pearson et al. (2005)
   estimated values that were not significantly different from observed
   values. However, the local equation is more appropriate for local
   estimation of AGB. since it has the lowest RSME and CV. Conclusions:
   Based on the proposed approach, we were able to offer a local equation
   for tree AGB estimation based on fallen trees. The DFF method is
   efficient regarding time and costs, avoiding tree logging in protected
   forests and helps to guide the choice of a proper equation for forest
   AGB demands.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Assess training needs of nutrition educators incorporating
   policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) approaches into their obesity
   prevention efforts, to identify content for online training.
   Methods: Conducted a national, online survey of state and local Expanded
   Food and Nutrition Education Program and Supplemental Nutrition
   Assistance Program Education professionals engaged in PSE efforts.
   Results: Respondents (n = 601) rated the importance of 24 training
   topics related to planning, implementing, and evaluating PSE approaches.
   Most (21) topics were rated very important or essential, confirming the
   need for a comprehensive approach. Paired-sample t tests found
   significant differences (P <0.001) in some training needs between local
   and state staff (eg, training in evaluation rated higher for state
   staff). Training needs did not differ by program, region, or length of
   employment. The top 5 settings for PSE efforts were schools, farmers'
   markets, food banks/pantries, community gardens, and after-school
   programs.
   Conclusions and Implications: Results informed the development of an
   online training for program implementers. Future research will be needed
   to assess and refine training needs further, which will evolve as
   nutrition educators gain more experience in PSE approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A neutral stimulus can acquire valence by being paired with a valenced
   stimulus, leading to a new attitude towards the previously neutral
   stimulus. There is, however, considerable debate about the mechanisms
   that underlie this process of affective attitude formation. Therefore,
   in the present study we employed a single-trial, intentional learning
   procedure that paired neutral with valenced words while recording ERP
   activity, and measured subsequent memory and subsequent attitudes for
   the pre-experimentally neutral words immediately following learning.
   Using traditional as well as single-trial ERP analyses, we found that
   frontal slow wave (FSW) activity, elicited while stimuli were being
   paired, was associated with both subsequent memory for the word pairs
   and subsequent attitudes towards the pre-experimentally neutral words.
   Specifically, FSW activity during the pairing of neutral with positive
   words was related to more positive subsequent attitudes, while during
   the pairing of neutral with negative words, it was associated with more
   negative subsequent attitudes, towards the pre-experimentally neutral
   words. Given that this FSW activity was also related to successful
   subsequent episodic memory retrieval for the word pairs, these findings
   provide evidence that the transfer of valence may depend on a process
   that supports associative episodic encoding during word paring. Further,
   a single-trial, mixed-effects model indicated that the relationship
   between encoding FSW activity and subsequent attitudes depended on the
   strength of the episodic memory trace. Thus, the present study provides
   novel evidence that a common mechanism contributes to both episodic
   memory encoding and affective attitude formation.}},

Abstract = {{The inventory of climate-related disasters is emblematic of the
   increasing impact of climate change and the concomitant rise in climate
   migration risk. It is becoming clear that, in the words of Ban Ki-moon,
   ``no country or city-rich or poor-is immune{''}. At the same time, the
   design of normative measures is undergoing a radical redefinition,
   towards assuming a ``preventive{''} role dictated by the imminent need
   to give a legal meaning to the uncertainty of this new epoch. The
   article starts from the recent adoption by the Parliamentary Assembly of
   the Council of Europe of a resolution on ``A legal status for `climate
   refugees'{''} to explore the potential role an anticipatory approach may
   play in shaping disaster-affected mobility regimes. It is timely to
   reflect on its legal implications by discussing emerging practices and
   the challenges of a normative evolution, that even if fragile, can be
   understood as part of an effort to reframe the international legal order
   towards balancing sovereign and common concerns. By considering Italy's
   contribution to the debate, the article sheds light on the role of
   domestic actors, such as courts and local authorities, as agents for
   legal development in multilevel environmental migration governance.}},

Abstract = {{Urban decay is one of the most critical challenges in urban development,
   whereby old urban districts fall into decrepitude and face serious
   social, economic, and physical problems. Governments thus implement
   renewal projects to revitalize physical and functional structures,
   restore socioeconomic capacity, and improve residents' quality of life.
   However, ignoring the complex nature of intervention in old urban areas
   may have undesirable consequences, including an additional decline in
   residents' quality of life. This article assesses residents' quality of
   life in neighbourhoods undergoing renewal, supported by experience from
   Mashhad, Iran. Using a mixed-methods design, it combines quantitative
   and qualitative methods of impact assessment, including questionnaires,
   semi-structured interviews, georeferenced data, and direct observation.
   The results show that a lack of sustainable financing for the Samen
   Renewal Project has had undesirable physical, sociocultural, and
   economic effects in the historical district of Mashhad and significantly
   reduced residents' quality of life due to focusing on the interests of
   tourists, pilgrims, and especially private developers.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bayesian methods had established a foothold in developing
   therapies in oncology trials. Methods: We identified clinical trials
   posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov database focused on Oncology trials
   with a Bayesian approach in their design. Differences in study
   characteristics such as design, study phase, randomization, masking,
   purpose of study, main outcomes, gender, age and funding involvement
   according to Bayesian approach were assessed using Chi-squared or
   Fisher's exact tests. Results: We identified 225 studies with Bayesian
   components in their design addressing oncological diseases. The most
   common designs were Bayesian Toxicity Monitoring (26.4\%), Model-based
   designs (36\%) Model-assisted designs (8\%). Statistical methods such as
   Bayesian logistic regression model (59.4\%), Bayesian piecewise
   exponential survival regression (10.9\%) and the Continual reassessment
   method (9.4\%) were the most used. Conclusions: Bayesian trials are more
   common in the early phases of drug development specifically in phase II
   trials (43.6\%). Cancer insti tutes or Hospitals funded most of the
   studies retrieved. This type of design has increased over time and
   represent an innovative means of increasing trial efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The linear tapering method duration can be determinant for sport
   performance.
   Objective. - The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of
   linear tapering duration method on anaerobic power and capacity in road
   cyclists.
   Materials and methods. - Seventeen male road cyclists, aged between 18
   and 30 years were randomly selected within the study criteria.
   Participants performed 16 weeks of training, adopting the undulating
   periodization with weekly variation of the training load. The tapering
   phase lasted 4 weeks, using the linear tapering method, reducing only
   the training volume: 85\% in the first, 70\% in the second, 55\% in the
   third and 40\% in the fourth week. The Wingate test was used to evaluate
   anaerobic power and capacity. Wingate was performed by the cyclists
   before the start of the season, at the end of the last week of each
   mesocycle (Preparatory I, Specific I and Specific II) and at the end of
   each week in the tapering phase.
   Results. - The results revealed a time effect for anaerobic power (P <
   0.01) and capacity (P< 0.01), with an increase after the preparatory
   phase I compared to pre-experimental (P=0.01), maintenance until phase
   specific II (P= 0.01), maintenance in the third week of tapering (P>
   0.05), finishing with attenuation in the fourth week of tapering
   (P=0.01).
   Conclusion. - It was concluded that 2 weeks of tapering was enough to
   improve the anaerobic power and capacity in road cyclists. (C) 2019

   Sites}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Future carbon management during energy production will rely on carbon
   capture and sequestration technology and carbon sequestration methods
   for offsetting non-capturable losses. The present study quantifies
   carbon sequestration via reforestation using measurements and modeling
   for recent and legacy surface coal mining grasslands that are
   re-restored through tree planting. This paper focuses on a case study of
   legacy coal mining sites in the southern Appalachia the United States.
   This five million-hectare region has a surface mining footprint of
   approximately 12\% of the land area, and the reclamation method was
   primarily grassland. The results of the soil carbon sequestration rates
   for restored forest soils approach 2.0 MgC ha(-1) y(-1) initially and
   average 1.0 MgC ha(-1) y(-1) for the first fifty years after
   reclamation. Plant, coarse root and litter carbon sequestration rates
   were 2.8 MgC ha(-1) y(-1) with plant carbon estimated to equilibrate to
   110 MgC ha(-1) after forty years. Plant, root and litter carbon stocks
   are projected to equilibrate at an order of magnitude greater carbon
   storage than the existing conditions, highlighting the net carbon gain.
   Reforestation of legacy mine sites shows carbon sequestration potential
   several orders of magnitude greater than typical land sequestration
   strategies for carbon offsets. Projections of future scenarios provide
   results that show the study region could be carbon neutral or a small
   sink if widespread reforesting during reclamation was implemented, which
   is contrary to the business-as-usual projections that result in a large
   amount of carbon being released to the atmosphere in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Computer aided implantology is the safest way to perform dental
   implants. The research of high accuracy represents a daily effort. The
   validated method to assess the accuracy of placed dental implants is the
   superimposition of a pre-operative and a post-operative cone beam
   computed tomography (CBCT) with planned and placed implants. This
   procedure is accountable for a biologic cost for the patient. To
   investigate alternative procedure for accuracy assessment, fifteen resin
   casts were printed. For each model, six implants were digitally planned
   and then placed following three different approaches: (a) template
   guided free hand, (b) static computer aided implantology (SCAI), and (c)
   dynamic computer aided implantology (DCAI). The placement accuracy of
   each implant was performed via two methods: the CBCT comparison
   described above and a matching between implant positions recovered from
   the original surgical plan with those obtained with a post-operative
   intraoral scan (IOS). Statistically significant mean differences between
   guided groups (SCAI and DCAI) and the free hand group were found at all
   considered deviations, while no differences resulted between the SCAI
   and DCAI approaches. Moreover, no mean statistically significant
   differences were found between CBCT and IOS assessment, confirming the
   validity of this new method.}},

   has been carried out for the province of Cadiz, Spain. To this end, the
   influents and effluents of 5 municipal wastewater treatment plants
   (representing 50 \% of the total wastewater in Cadiz) and 2 industrial
   plants treating wastewater from an industrial estate and a large marine
   construction firm that builds ships and offshore platforms (5 MWWTPs and
   2 IWWTPs) have been studied for the first time. MP levels were higher in
   IWWTPs than in MWWTPs, especially in the wastewaters from the marine
   construction company. Removal efficiencies ranged between 78 and 97 \%.
   The size and shape distribution of MPs in the effluents resembled that
   in the influents, suggesting that no preferential removal of MPs
   occurred in the MWWTPs or IWWTPs with respect to shape and size. PVC,
   HDPE, PEMA, PP, PS and PE were the most common MPs detected in the
   influents of the studied WWTPs. The relative contribution of MPs (MPs/L)
   to the environment from the IWWTPs compared to that from the MWWTPs was
   found to be highly significant. Results suggested that around
   8.5(star)10(11) of MPs/year could be discharged into the environment by
   the treated wastewaters under study. The results of this paper comprise
   useful tools to obtain in-depth knowledge of MPs in different kinds of
   wastewater treatment plants and map an important environmental location
   (close to the Straits of Gibraltar linking the Atlantic Ocean and the
   Mediterranean Sea).}},

Abstract = {{The geography of ageing is addressed in this article by providing new
   empirical evidence about the significant role of daily activities on the
   perceptions of isolation and loneliness. The developed model of
   socio-spatial isolation is based on data from time-space diaries and
   questionnaires completed by older adults living in three cities in the
   Czech Republic. The study suggests that socio-spatial isolation is a
   multicomponent (consisting of passivity, isolation and loneliness
   components), place-dependent and gendered issue. The passivity is
   significantly associated with the income and leisure sport activities.
   The isolation can be well predicted by the age, gender and education,
   and the frequency of work and specific leisure activities, which are
   constrained by health conditions, financial opportunities and spatial
   mobility. Particularly trips to nature, sport activities, cultural
   events, get together with friends, and visits to restaurants have a
   positive effect on reducing isolation. Women, particularly those who
   raised more children, more likely feel lonely in old age when family
   contacts are reduced. Visits to restaurants, shopping malls and cultural
   events have a positive effect on reducing loneliness. A constrained
   mobility and higher time consumption for necessary activities also
   proved to be an age-related and gendered problem. In this respect,
   policy interventions should seek to improve flexible work opportunities,
   the digital skills of older people, and the accessibility and safety of
   public transport with regard to perceived constraints, which is gaining
   in importance in the Covid-19 era.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated energy systems (IES)-including the intimate coupling between
   thermal generators, the grid, ancillary processes, and energy
   storage-are becoming increasingly pertinent to the energy grid. To
   facilitate a better understanding of IES, Idaho National Laboratory

   (TEDS) to test the interoperability of nuclear reactors, energy storage,
   and ancillary processes in a real-world setting. This paper provides an
   overview of the development of TEDS within INL's Modelica dynamic
   process modeling ecosystem as part of the IES initiative. The model will
   bridge the gap between lab-scale experimental results and desired
   grid-scale energy solutions. Two simulation sets were run. The first was
   a 5-h test simulating a facility shakedown test, putting the facility
   through five potential operating modes and showcasing the ability of the
   valving, control sensors, and component controllers to meet system
   demands. The second case imposed a typical summer day demand on the
   system from a region with mixed commercial and residential electrical
   needs. In this case, the generator alone could not meet peak demand but
   instead required the thermal-storage unit to act as a peaking unit.}},

Title = {{New insights into source and dispersal of Mediterranean S1 tephra, an
   early Holocene marker horizon erupted at Mt. Erciyes (Turkey)}},
Journal = {{QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{249}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Deposition of early Holocene Eastern Mediterranean S1 tephra and a Black
   Sea cryptotephra coincides with cultural transitions in the Fertile
   Crescent termed the Neolithic Revolution as well as sapropel formation
   during climate variability of the African humid period, classifying them
   as paramount regional marker horizons for archaeology as well as
   paleoclimatology. Their correlations with specific eruptions of the Mt.
   Erciyes stratovolcanic complex (Central Anatolia) remained inconclusive
   though. Here, we use zircon double-dating by (U-Th)/He and U-Th
   disequilibrium methods, major and trace element tephra glass
   geochemistry, and probabilistic modeling of tephra dispersal in an
   attempt to characterize all major late Quaternary proximal tephras of
   Mt. Erciyes, and to correlate them with distal deposits. Furthermore, we
   discuss contrasting proximal and distal tephra dispersal.
   Three nearly-coeval rhyolitic satellite domes (Dikkartin, Perikartin,
   and Karagullu) erupted at Mt. Erciyes in the early Holocene, and their
   dome extrusions were all preceded by explosive phases producing
   pyroclastic material that formed tephra fall and pyroclastic flow
   deposits. The new eruption age of 9.03 +/- 0.55 ka (1 sigma uncertainty
   here and elsewhere) for proximal Dikkartin pumice is consistent with
   C-14-based S1 tephra chronologies in distal locations averaging 8.92 +/-
   0.03 cal ka BP. Perikartin pyroclastic flow deposits predate S1 tephra
   by ca. 0.8 ka according to a pair of published C-14 ages, and
   stratigraphically overlie Karagullu fall-out, here dated to 8.2 +/- 1.8
   ka. Previously undated proximal tephras of Mt. Erciyes erupted in the
   Late (85.2 +/- 4.9 ka) and Middle Pleistocene (154.5 +/- 5.3 ka). S1
   tephra glass is chemically similar to that of Dikkartin fall-out, but
   also indistinguishable from that of Perikartin fall-out. Karagullu
   pumice is characterized by a distinct glass chemical composition, which
   correlates with that of unnamed cryptotephra reported for the
   southeastern Black Sea instead, where these results call for a
   re-evaluation of existing age models.
   Maximum lithic clast size isopleths for proximal Dikkartin fall-out
   indicate eastward dispersal of a 20 +/- 5 km high eruption plume by
   stratospheric winds, in agreement with results of probabilistic tephra
   dispersal modeling. This azimuth contrasts with the known distribution
   of S1 tephra at distal locations that are all south of Mt. Erciyes.
   Significant tephra occurrences at up to 1300 km distance and orthogonal
   to prevalent stratospheric wind directions either result from very
   atypical wind conditions (probability << 10 \%), or are caused by tephra
   transport by prevailing low altitude winds. Two scenarios are proposed
   for low altitude transport: eolian reworking of primary fall-out (more
   likely from the more widespread Dikkartin deposits), or co-ignimbrite
   ash cloud dispersal (more likely from the Perikartin eruption which
   predominantly produced pyroclastic flows). Because S1 tephra is
   chemically indistinguishable from both Dikkartin and Perikartin by major
   and trace element glass compositions, its exact source and dispersal
   mechanism remain ambiguous, although existing C-14 ages for Perikartin
   predating those for S1 tephra favor Dikkartin as its source. (C) 2020

   indicators and assessments to measure vulnerability of Pinon-Juniper
   woodlands}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{119}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The process of identifying tangible actions to conserve important
   resources in the face of climate change is challenged because of
   uncertainties regarding future conditions. There is also a lack of
   existing methods for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed management
   actions for mitigating negative impacts. For pinon-juniper (PJ)
   ecosystems within the Southwest U.S., efforts are further hampered by a
   lack of information on the direction and drivers of changing population
   trends. PJ ecosystems, while ecologically important, have been the focus
   of eradication efforts due to perceptions that they are encroaching into
   important grasslands. However, recent impacts of drought, insect
   outbreaks, and fire increasingly threaten these ecosystems. It is
   unclear at this time where and to what extent PJ ecosystems are
   vulnerable to climate change and other disturbances, challenging
   management. To develop a method for determining the current and future
   status of PJ ecosystems, we engaged with local land managers to identify
   key indicators and drivers of PJ population change and developed a
   vulnerability assessment approach based on these indicators. Our goal
   was to use this process to create data products that would assist
   resource managers dealing with rapidly changing landscapes. Borrowing
   from other successful assessments strategies, we used Adaptation Forums
   to facilitate stakeholder input to vet potentially relevant indicators
   of PJ status and response to climate change and other stressors. Through
   multiple iterations, we finalized a list of indicators that could be
   used to quantify vulnerability of PJ ecosystems. We then developed a
   vulnerability assessment framework that can systematically quantify
   risks to PJ based on these indicators and applied this framework to two
   landscapes in the southwestern U.S. This process allows us to support
   decision making processes by generating information on future PJ status
   even when data are incomplete.}},

Title = {{Drivers of eco-innovation and conventional innovation in the Canadian
   wine industry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{275}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The Canadian wine industry is a small but growing sector of the economy
   rooted in non-metropolitan areas. Dependent upon local natural resources
   and climatic conditions and coupled with changes in consumers'
   preferences, wineries are pressured to adopt and develop more ecological
   practices and production processes. It has thus become increasingly
   important to understand the nature of the capabilities and resources
   wineries build upon to develop eco-innovations. Based on a survey of 151
   wine firms in Canada, this study (i) explores the main drivers of
   eco-innovation and (ii) analyzes differences between the factors
   associated with eco-innovation and conventional innovation. The results
   of our empirical analysis show that both types of innovation are
   associated with internal factors. This partly reflects specificities of
   Canada's wine industry, which is comprised of small firms generally
   proceeding by internal experimentation, and trial and error. However,
   eco-innovation in this industry differs from conventional innovation in
   that it is more closely related to external sources of information,
   which are generally more technical and related to the environment. (C)

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders represent a heterogeneous group of clinical
   situations, and are mainly represented by a deficit of social
   communication. In this study, we compare two strategies to enhance
   communicative/social skills, namely self-video modeling and peer video
   modeling. The subjects were divided into two groups treated via the
   method of self-video modeling (group 1) or peer video modeling (group
   2). For both groups of subjects affected by ASD-HF (Autism Spectrum
   Disorder-high-functioning), three different activities were proposed:
   (a) interacting with a salesperson while making a purchase, (b)
   initiating and maintaining a conversation with peers, and (c) starting
   and maintaining an enjoyable activity with a peer. The ability to
   rapidly accomplish the task was used as the main criteria to appraise
   the groups' responses to the proposed activities. In group 1, the use of
   self-video modeling procedures demonstrated a faster and correct
   execution of the three proposed tasks (especially task 3) when compared
   to group 2. In group 2, the use of peer video modeling has instead led
   to a slower acquisition of abilities to process and perform the tasks.
   The use of self-video modeling speeds up the acquisition of skills to
   perform communicative/social tasks, compared to peer video modeling's
   slower performance in subjects with ASD-HF. Results could be related to
   either the amount of time the subject is exposed to the task or to the
   capacity of ASD-HF subjects to self-value one's own actions more than
   others. In our work, we have tried to reset the differences in exposure
   time. Therefore, self-video modeling is demonstrated to be more
   effective, as it produces a response to the signification/mirroring
   characteristic of ASD-HF.}},

Abstract = {{A multilayer approach has recently received particular attention in
   network neuroscience as a suitable model to describe brain dynamics by
   adjusting its activity in different frequency bands, time scales,
   modalities, or ages to different layers of a multiplex graph. In this
   paper, we demonstrate an approach to a frequency-based multilayer
   functional network constructed from nonstationary multivariate data by
   analyzing recurrences in application to electroencephalography. Using
   the recurrence-based index of synchronization, we construct intralayer
   (within-frequency) and interlayer (cross-frequency) graph edges to model
   the evolution of a whole-head functional connectivity network during a
   prolonged stimuli classification task. We demonstrate that the graph
   edges' weights increase during the experiment and negatively correlate
   with the response time. We also show that while high-frequency activity
   evolves toward synchronization of remote local areas, low-frequency
   connectivity tends to establish large-scale coupling between them.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess and quantify the effect of perioperative music on
   medication requirement, length of stay and costs in adult surgical
   patients. Summary Background Data: There is an increasing interest in
   nonpharmacological interventions to decrease opioid analgesics use, as
   they have significant adverse effects and opioid prescription rates have
   reached epidemic proportions. Previous studies have reported beneficial
   outcomes of perioperative music. Methods: A systematic literature search
   of 8 databases was performed from inception date to January 7, 2019.
   Randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of perioperative
   music on medication requirement, length of stay or costs in adult
   surgical patients were eligible. Meta-analysis was performed using
   random effect models, pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) were
   calculated with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). This study was
   registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018093140) and adhered to the Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines.
   Results: The literature search yielded 2414 articles, 55 studies (N =
   4968 patients) were included. Perioperative music significantly reduced
   postoperative opioid requirement (pooled SMD -0.31 {[}95\% CI -0.45 to
   -0.16], P < 0.001, I-2 = 44.3, N = 1398). Perioperative music also
   significantly reduced intraoperative propofol (pooled SMD -0.72 {[}95\%
   CI -1.01 to -0.43], P < 0.00001, I-2 = 61.1, N = 554) and midazolam
   requirement (pooled SMD -1.07 {[}95\% CI -1.70 to -0.44], P < 0.001, I-2
   = 73.1, N = 184), while achieving the same sedation level. No
   significant reduction in length of stay (pooled SMD -0.18 {[}95\% CI
   -0.43 to 0.067], P = 0.15, I-2 = 56.0, N = 600) was observed.
   Conclusions: Perioperative music can reduce opioid and sedative
   medication requirement, potentially improving patient outcome and
   reducing medical costs as higher opioid dosage is associated with an
   increased risk of adverse events and chronic opioid abuse.}},

   prepared by one-step precipitation, using tpgs as emulsifier. The drug
   loading and particle size were used as an index to optimize the
   formulation, and the physical and chemical properties such as in vitro
   release and stability were characterized. The uptake of fluorescein
   coumarin 6 (C6) loaded PEG-PLGA-NP by MIAPACA-2 cells was observed by
   fluorescence microscope, and the growth and apoptosis of MIAPACA-2 cells
   after PTX-PEG-PLGA-NP were detected by MTT and flow cytometry
   respectively. The entrapment efficiency of the nanoparticles was
   90.26\%, the drug loading was 10.13\%, the average particle size was
   92.3 +/- 3.1 nm, and the zeta potential was 10.48 +/- 1.54 mV. The
   cumulative releases of nano preparation and general preparation (Taxol
   injection) in four hours were 25.9\% and 98.5\%, respectively; and the
   former had a strong sustained -release effect. The results of cell
   uptake experiments showed that the uptake of c6-PEG-PLGA-NP by MIAPACA-2
   cells increased gradually with time. MTT results showed that
   PTX-PEG-PLGA-NP had no significant difference in the inhibition rate of
   MIAPACA-2 cells compared with PTX group. Flow cytometry showed that
   PTX-PEG-PLGAnp was superior better than PTX in inducing apoptosis in
   MIAPACA-2 cells. The tpgs emulsification method is simple and
   environment -friendly. The paclitaxel loaded nanoparticles prepared
   through the optimization of the formulation have large drug loading
   capacity and uniform particle size, which can target the pancreatic
   cancer MIAPACA-2 cells, and do not weaken its ability to inhibit the
   growth of MIAPACA-2 cells. The nanoparticles also induce apoptosis in
   cancer MIAPACA-2 cells, and could be used for further clinical treatment
   of pancreatic cancer.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the Potential of Legumes to Mitigate N2O Emissions From
   Permanent Grassland Using Process-Based Models}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{A potential strategy for mitigating nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from
   permanent grasslands is the partial substitution of fertilizer nitrogen
   (N-fert) with symbiotically fixed nitrogen (N-symb) from legumes. The
   input of N-symb reduces the energy costs of producing fertilizer and
   provides a supply of nitrogen (N) for plants that is more synchronous to
   plant demand than occasional fertilizer applications. Legumes have been
   promoted as a potential N2O mitigation strategy for grasslands, but
   evidence to support their efficacy is limited, partly due to the
   difficulty in conducting experiments across the large range of potential
   combinations of legume proportions and fertilizer N inputs. These
   experimental constraints can be overcome by biogeochemical models that
   can vary legume-fertilizer combinations and subsequently aid the design
   of targeted experiments. Using two variants each of two biogeochemical
   models (APSIM and DayCent), we tested the N2O mitigation potential and
   productivity of full factorial combinations of legume proportions and
   fertilizer rates for five temperate grassland sites across the globe.
   Both models showed that replacing fertilizer with legumes reduced N2O
   emissions without reducing productivity across a broad range of
   legume-fertilizer combinations. Although the models were consistent with
   the relative changes of N2O emissions compared to the baseline scenario
   (200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); no legumes), they predicted different levels of
   absolute N2O emissions and thus also of absolute N2O emission
   reductions; both were greater in DayCent than in APSIM. We recommend
   confirming these results with experimental studies assessing the effect
   of clover proportions in the range 30-50\% and <= 150 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)
   input as these were identified as best-bet climate smart agricultural
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{Quorum sensing is a communication system among bacteria to sense the
   proper time to express their virulence factors. Quorum sensing
   inhibition is a therapeutic strategy to block bacterial mechanisms of
   virulence. The aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate new
   bioisosteres of N-acyl homoserine lactones as Quorum sensing inhibitors
   in Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 by quantifying the specific
   production of violacein. Five series of compounds with different
   heterocyclic scaffolds were synthesized in good yields: thiazoles,
   16a-c, thiazolines 17a-c, benzimidazoles 18a-c, pyridines 19a-c and
   imidazolines 32a-c. All 15 compounds showed activity as Quorum sensing
   inhibitors except 16a. Compounds 16b, 17a-c, 18a, 18c, 19c and 32b
   exhibited activity at concentrations of 10 mu M and 100 mu M,
   highlighting the activity of benzimidazole 18a (IC50 = 36.67 mu M) and
   32b (IC50 = 85.03 mu M). Pyridine 19c displayed the best quorum sensing
   inhibition activity (IC50 = 9.66 mu M). Molecular docking simulations
   were conducted for all test compounds on the Chromobacterium violaceum
   CviR protein to gain insight into the process of quorum sensing
   inhibition. The in-silico data reveal that all 15 the compounds have
   higher affinity for the protein than the native AHL ligand (1). A strong
   correlation was found between the theoretical and experimental results.}},

Pages = {{938-942}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Hearing loss caused by GJB2 mutations is inherited in an
   autosomal recessive manner (DFNB1); thus siblings of an affected child
   have a 25\% chance of also being affected. Hearing loss among subsequent
   siblings carrying the same GJB2 mutation is a concern for parents and a
   frequent topic of enquiry during genetic counseling. Evidence exists for
   genotype-phenotype correlations of GJB2 mutations; however, no analysis
   of differences in hearing among siblings, in whom the common genetic
   background may decrease variation, has been reported. The purpose of the
   present study was to investigate hearing differences between siblings
   with identical GJB2 mutations.
   Methods: We examined the hearing levels of 12 pairs of siblings; each
   pair had the same pathogenic GJB2 mutations. Differences in hearing
   acuity between sibling pairs detected by auditory evaluation.Hosoya

   Results: No significant correlation was detected between the average
   hearing levels of first and second affected siblings. Average
   differences in acoustic threshold >30 dB were observed between four
   pairs of siblings, whereas the remaining eight pairs had average
   threshold values within 20 dB of one another.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that auditory acuity would be expected
   to approximate that found in the first child in approximately 70\% of
   subsequent children with GJB2-mediated hearing loss, whereas 30\% of
   subsequent siblings would have average differences of >30 dB. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Obtaining an accurate preoperative diagnosis is crucial. This study
   aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and utility of endoscopic
   ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) for preoperative
   pancreatic solid lesions.
   Materials and methods
   We retrospectively assessed all patients who underwent endoscopic
   ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) or EUS-FNB to
   evaluate solid pancreatic lesions preoperatively at our center between
   July 2013 and June 2020. We enrolled 71 patients who underwent EUS-FNA
   using a 22 G conventional needle (FNA group) and 34 patients who
   underwent EUS-FNB using a 22 G Franseen needle (FNB group). Overall, 105
   patients were analyzed. We employed propensity-matched analysis and
   adjusted the confounders.
   Results
   No procedural adverse events were encountered. Both groups showed no
   significant differences in the procedure time, technical success rate,
   and rate of operator changes from trainee to expert. Regarding
   diagnostic accuracy, the FNB group (88.2\%; 30/34) was higher but not
   significantly different from the FNA group (85.3\%; 29/34) (p > .99).
   Furthermore, the FNB group (median 2, IQR;2-3) had a significantly lower
   number of punctures than the FNA group (median 3, IQR; 2-4) (p = .01).
   Conclusions
   The FNB needle provides higher diagnostic accuracy and requires
   significantly fewer punctures than conventional needles even at
   facilities with no available rapid on-site evaluation. Thus, using the
   FNB needle can be useful for preoperative pancreatic solid lesions.}},

Title = {{Reanalysis and lingering misinterpretation of linguistic dependencies in
   native and non-native sentence comprehension}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Research on temporarily ambiguous ``garden-path{''} sentences (e.g.,
   After Mary dressed the baby laughed) has shown that initially assigned
   misinterpretations linger after reanalysis of the temporarily ambiguous
   phrase in both native (L1) and non-native (L2) readers. L2 speakers have
   particular difficulty with reanalysis, but the source of this L1/L2
   difference is debated. Furthermore, how lingering misinterpretation may
   influence other aspects of language processing has not been
   systematically examined. We report three offline and two online
   experiments investigating reanalysis and misinterpretation of filler-gap
   dependences (e.g., Elisa noticed the truck which the policeman watched
   the car from). Our results showed that Ll and L2 speakers are prone to
   lingering misinterpretation during dependency resolution. L1/L2
   differences were observed such that L2 speakers had increased difficulty
   reanalysing some filler-gap dependencies, however this was dependent on
   how the dependency was disambiguated. These results are compatible with
   the ``good-enough{''} approach to language processing, and suggest that
   L1/L2 differences are more likely when reanalysis is particularly
   difficult.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously developed a bifunctional aptamer (bApt) binding to
   both human thrombin and camptothecin derivative (CPT1), and showed that
   bApt acts as a drug carrier under the phenomenon named selective
   oligonucleotide entrapment in fibrin polymers (SOEF), which enables
   efficient enrichment of CPT1 into fibrin gels, resulting in significant
   inhibition of tumor cell growth. However, although the derivative CPT1
   exhibits anticancer activity, it is not an approved drug. In this study,
   we evaluated the binding properties of bApt to irinotecan, a
   camptothecin analog commonly used for anticancer drug therapy, in
   addition to unmodified camptothecin (CPT). Furthermore, we have revealed
   that irinotecan binds to bApt like CPT1 and is selectively concentrated
   on fibrin gels formed around the tumor cells under the SOEF phenomenon
   to suppress cell proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{Background and study aims Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are
   classified into eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastritis,
   eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and eosinophilic colitis according to the
   site of eosinophilic infiltration. Although well established in
   eosinophilic esophagitis, endoscopic findings in eosinophilic gastritis
   and eosinophilic gastroenteritis with regard to gastric lesions have not
   been clearly described. The aim of this study was to identify endoscopic
   findings of gastric lesions associated with eosinophilic
   gastrointestinal disorders.
   Patients and methods Out of 278 patients with eosinophilic
   gastrointestinal disorders, 18 had eosinophilic gastritis or
   eosinophilic gastroenteritis confirmed by biopsy; their endoscopic
   images were analyzed retrospectively. The association between endoscopic
   findings and number of eosinophils in the gastric mucosa was
   investigated.
   Results Erythema was most frequently observed (72 \%), followed by
   ulcers (39 \%), discoloration (33\%), erosions (28\%), nodularity
   (28\%), and polyps (28 \%). There were several unique endoscopic
   findings such as submucosal tumorlike deep large ulcers in three
   patients, antral Penthorumlike appearances (small nodules radially lined
   toward the pyloric ring) in three patients, ``muskmelon- like
   appearances{''} (discolored mucosa-composed mesh pattern) in three
   patients, multiple white granular elevations in two patients, cracks
   (appearance of furrows similar to those in eosinophilic esophagitis) in
   five patients, and antral rings in one patient. No significant
   association was observed between endoscopic findings and number of
   gastric eosinophils.
   Conclusions Several unique endoscopic findings of gastric lesions were
   observed in patients with eosinophilic gastritis or eosinophilic
   gastroenteritis. Submucosal tumor-like ulcers, antral Penthorum-like
   appearances, muskmelon- like appearances, and cracks might be associated
   with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Small hepatocytes (SH) have been identified in regenerative organs and
   have been proposed to be hepatocyte progenitor cells. Their
   characteristic presence in birds, and their maturation into functional
   and mature hepatocytes, have not yet been elucidated. We previously
   demonstrated the appearance of chicken SH, which express CD44, in a
   model of chicken hepatopathy treated with bile duct ligation (BDL). We
   expanded on our previous research and performed a detailed study of the
   ultrastructure of chicken SH. Four weeks after BDL, we observed chicken
   SH with high electron density cytoplasm and with colony formation. In
   the chicken SH, electron microscopical analysis found no formation of
   tight junctions and no glycogen. Ultrastructural analysis also revealed
   the existence of various types of chicken SH with characteristics lying
   between those of chicken SH with colony formation and mature
   hepatocytes. The analysis of immunoelectron microscopy showed CD44
   expressed on the surface of the extensive SH-like cells in the hepatic
   lamina. These results suggest that the expression of CD44 changes

Title = {{The Therapeutic Effects of Dodecaborate Containing Boronophenylalanine

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   We have developed a new boron compound for application in boron neutron
   capture therapy (BNCT) named boronophenylalanine-amide alkyl
   dodecaborate (BADB). It is characterized by a larger amount of B-10 per
   molecule, linking boronphenylalanine (BPA) and dodecaborate, and we
   conducted various experiments on its efficacy. Its high accumulation at
   the cellular level made it a promising novel drug, but it did not
   sufficiently accumulate in brain tumor tissue when intravenously
   administered. However, in neutron irradiation experiments, the drug
   showed remarkably high compound biological effectiveness and
   significantly prolonged the survival time in rat brain tumor models. We
   confirmed the antitumor efficacy of BADB in BNCT and its additional
   efficacy when administered in combination with BPA. Though this drug
   showed poor results when administered as a single agent, it was superior
   to BPA alone when administered in combination with BPA, making it a drug
   that we have been waiting for in our clinical practice.
   Background: The development of effective boron compounds is a major area
   of research in the study of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). We
   created a novel boron compound, boronophenylalanine-amide alkyl
   dodecaborate (BADB), for application in BNCT and focused on elucidating
   how it affected a rat brain tumor model. Methods: The boron
   concentration of F98 rat glioma cells following exposure to
   boronophenylalanine (BPA) (which is currently being utilized clinically)
   and BADB was evaluated, and the biodistributions in F98 glioma-bearing
   rats were assessed. In neutron irradiation studies, the in vitro
   cytotoxicity of each boron compound and the in vivo corresponding
   therapeutic effect were evaluated in terms of survival time. Results:
   The survival fractions of the groups irradiated with BPA and BADB were
   not significantly different. BADB administered for 6 h after the
   termination of convection-enhanced delivery ensured the highest boron
   concentration in the tumor (45.8 mu g B/g). The median survival time in
   the BADB in combination with BPA group showed a more significant
   prolongation of survival than that of the BPA group. Conclusion: BADB is
   a novel boron compound for BNCT that triggers a prolonged survival
   effect in patients receiving BNCT.}},

Abstract = {{Adequate shape stability is a prerequisite for utilization of sawn
   boards in the building industry. This study investigated the possibility
   of indirect genetic improvement of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
   sawn-board shape stability (specifically the bow, crook and twist) via
   selective breeding based on traits that can be non-destructively
   measured on standing trees. Relationships between shape stability and
   wood quality traits measured on logs and sawn boards were also
   determined. A total of 1896 standing trees from a 39-year-old Scots pine
   full-sib progeny test were non-destructively measured. A subset of 496
   trees was harvested and sawn into 50 x 100 mm boards, the quality of
   which was assessed both non-destructively and destructively. Among the
   traits assessed on standing trees, grain angle (GRA) appeared to be the
   best predictor of sawn-board twisting and crooking (r(A) = 0.84 and
   0.62, respectively). The individual-tree narrow-sense heritability
   (h(i)(2)) was moderate for twist and GRA (0.37 and 0.40, respectively),
   low for bow (0.21) and very low for crook (0.05). Selective breeding
   targeting lower GRA would result in lower twist and crook but could also
   increase sawn-board density, stiffness and strength.}},

Abstract = {{Even before the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic,
   prominent women mayors in the United States enacted proactive and
   innovative policies to prevent local outbreaks and soften the social and

   led the way in local pandemic response efforts. This article identifies
   four major features of these and other women mayors' early responses.
   First, women mayors demonstrated proactive leadership even when faced
   with pushback. Second, these mayors advocated for transparent and
   evidence-based decision-making at all levels of government. Third, they
   enacted measures to protect vulnerable communities and reduce
   disparities. Fourth, they actively shared advice on best practices and
   lessons learned, and provided examples for other local leaders to
   follow. The article concludes by situating these responses in the larger
   research on gender and leadership and asks whether these women's actions
   are unique or part of a systematic trend of gendered responses to the
   pandemic.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: As the health care system in the United States shifts toward
   value-based care, there has been increased interest in performing total
   joint arthroplasty in the outpatient setting to optimize costs,
   outcomes, and patient satisfaction. Several studies have demonstrated
   success in performing ambulatory total knee and hip arthroplasty. The
   purpose of this study was to compare short-term outcomes and
   complications after total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) across the inpatient
   and outpatient operative settings.
   Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement
   Program database was queried to identify 575 patients undergoing primary
   TEA using the Current Procedural Terminology code 24363. Of this sample,
   458 were inpatient and 117 were outpatient procedures. Propensity score
   matching using a 3:1 inpatient-to-outpatient ratio was performed to
   account for baseline differences in several variablesdage, sex, body
   mass index class, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and
   various comorbiditiesd-between the inpatient and outpatient groups.
   After matching, the rates of various short-term outcomes and
   complications were compared between the inpatient and outpatient groups.
   Results: Inpatient TEA was associated with a higher rate of
   complications relative to outpatient TEA, including non-home discharge
   (14.9\% vs. 7.5\%, P = .05), unplanned hospital readmission (7.4\% vs.
   0.9\%, P = .01), surgical complications (7.6\% vs. 2.6\%, P = .04), and
   medical complications (3.6\% vs. 0.0\%, P = .04).
   Conclusion: Outpatient TEA has a lower short-term complication rate than
   inpatient TEA. Outpatient TEA should be considered for patients for whom
   such a discharge pathway is feasible. Future research should focus on
   risk stratification of patients and specific criteria for deciding when
   to pursue outpatient TEA. (C) 2020 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery

Abstract = {{Previous research has observed that the speed of alpha band oscillations
   (8-12 Hz range) recorded during resting electroencephalography is slowed
   in chronic pain patients. While this slowing may reflect pathological
   changes that occur during the chronification of pain, an alternative
   explanation is that healthy individuals with slower alpha oscillations
   are more sensitive to prolonged pain, and by extension, more susceptible
   to developing chronic pain. To test this hypothesis, we examined the
   relationship between the pain-free, resting alpha oscillation speed of
   healthy individuals and their sensitivity to two models of prolonged
   pain, Phasic Heat Pain and Capsaicin Heat Pain, at two visits separated
   by 8 weeks on average (n = 61 Visit 1, n = 46 Visit 2). We observed that
   the speed of an individual's pain-free alpha oscillations was negatively
   correlated with sensitivity to both models and that this relationship
   was reliable across short (minutes) and long (weeks) timescales.
   Furthermore, the speed of pain-free alpha oscillations can successfully
   identify the most pain sensitive individuals, which we validated on data
   from a separate, independent study. These results suggest that alpha
   oscillation speed is a reliable biomarker of prolonged pain sensitivity
   with potential for prospectively identifying pain sensitivity in the
   clinic.}},

Abstract = {{Upon exposure to environmental stress, the primary electron donor in
   photosystem I (PSI), P700, is oxidized to suppress the production of
   reactive oxygen species that could oxidatively inactivate the function
   of PSI. The illumination of rice leaves with actinic light induces
   intrinsic fluctuations in the opening and closing of stomata, causing
   the net CO2 assimilation rate to fluctuate. We examined the effects of
   these intrinsic fluctuations on electron transport reactions. Under
   atmospheric O-2 conditions (21 kPa), the effective quantum yield of
   photosystem II (PSII) (Y(II)) remained relatively high while the net CO2
   assimilation rate fluctuated, which indicates the function of
   alternative electron flow. By contrast, under low O-2 conditions (2
   kPa), Y(II) fluctuated. These results suggest that photorespiration
   primarily drove the alternative electron flow. Photorespiration
   maintained the oxidation level of ferredoxin (Fd) throughout the
   fluctuation of the net CO2 assimilation rate. Moreover, the relative
   activity of photorespiration was correlated with both the oxidation
   level of P700 and the magnitude of the proton gradient across the
   thylakoid membrane in 21 kPa O-2 conditions. These results show that
   photorespiration oxidized P700 by stimulating the proton gradient
   formation when CO2 assimilation was suppressed by stomatal closure.}},

Abstract = {{Psychologists have made progress into understanding what it is about our
   minds and brains that guides how, when, and why we decide to help
   others. However, little attention has been given to the important
   contribution of episodic representation. Supported by the medial
   temporal lobe subsystem, the ability to imagine or remember specific
   moments from the past or future has a critical influence on one's
   affective and cognitive experience, with broad implications for guiding
   decision making and behavior. Despite this, only recent work has begun
   to illuminate the role of episodic simulation and memory in prosocial
   judgments and behaviors. Here we consider how episodic representation
   and helping decisions may theoretically relate and interact, reviewing
   extant research on the link between episodic representation and
   prosocial decision making and bringing attention to open questions for
   future research to address. We propose here that a comprehensive picture
   of human prosocial behavior necessitates the consideration of episodic
   representation, as well as an effort to better understand both its
   distinct relationship to prosocial decisions and how it engages a
   diverse range of other mental processes to help us help others.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Due to limited information available on the
   frequency and spectrum of cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance
   regulator (CFTR) gene mutations in congenital bilateral absence of vas
   deferens (CBAVD) in Indian population, it is difficult to provide
   accurate genetic counselling to couples. The present study was
   undertaken to investigate the spectrum and frequency of CFTR gene
   mutations in Indian men with CBAVD and to determine the female CF
   carrier status. Methods: Direct DNA sequencing of the CFTR gene was
   carried out in eighty CBAVD men, their female partners and fifty
   controls from the general population. Pathological significance of the
   identified novel CFTR gene variants was carried out using in silico
   tools. Appropriate genetic counselling was provided to the couples prior
   to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Results: A significant
   association was observed for CFTR gene variants in Indian CBAVD men
   versus controls (odds ratio: 12.1; 95\% confidence interval: 4.8-30.4;
   P<0.0001). A total of 20 CFTR gene variants were identified in 53 CBAVD
   men. Eight novel missense CFTR gene variants (L214V, A238P, E379V,
   L578I, F587L, L926W, R1325K and R1453Q); two novel splice-site gene
   variants (c.1-30C>G and IVS1+2T>G) and ten previously reported mutations
   (R75Q, c.1210-12{[}5], F508del, A309G, R334W, I444T, R668C, R709X,
   A1285V and Q1352H) were detected in CBAVD men. The novel and reported
   CFTR gene mutations were L926W (2.5\%, P=0.26), R1453Q (2.5\%, P=0.26),
   F508del (8.75\%, P=0.03) and c.1210-12{[}5] (42.5\%, P=0.002). A total
   of 13 (16.2\%) female partners were found to be a CF carrier. Nine
   couples had a risk of transmitting mutant CFTR allele to the offspring.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: The heterogeneous spectrum of CFTR gene
   in Indian population suggests the necessity of screening CBAVD men and
   female partners for accurate genetic counselling prior to undergoing
   ICSI.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and study aims: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of
   chronic hepatitis. Although liver histopathological examination remains
   the reference standard for liver fibrosis assessment, noninvasive means
   of assessment such as shear wave elastography (SWE) and aspartate
   aminotransferase-platelet ratio index (APRI) have been developed to
   reduce the need for biopsy. We evaluated the efficacy of SWE and APRI
   versus liver biopsy for liver fibrosis assessment in children with
   chronic HCV infection.
   Patients and methods: Fibrosis staging was performed in 46 children (35
   boys, 11 girls; mean age: 15.5 2 +/- 2.71 years) with liver
   biopsy-proven chronic HCV infection according to the METAVIR system. SWE
   was performed within 6 months of liver biopsy. APRI scores were
   calculated using data collected on the day of biopsy.
   Results: Eighteen children had no or mild fibrosis (<F2, 39.1\%) and 28
   had significant fibrosis (>= F2, 60.9\%), with a significant difference
   between the corresponding mean APRI scores (0.43 +/- 0.23 vs 1.26 +/-
   1.24; p = 0.043). The APRI scores exhibited a significant correlation
   with the METAVIR stage (r = 0.630; p < 0.001). The SWE values were
   significantly higher in those with significant fibrosis than in those
   with no or mild fibrosis (10.43 vs 4.26 kPa; p < 0.000). These values
   exhibited significant correlations with the METAVIR stage and APRI score
   (r = 0.863 and 0.544, respectively; both p < 0.001). For differentiating
   significant fibrosis, the sensitivity, specificity and positive and
   negative predictive values for an APRI cutoff value of 0.62 were
   46.43\%, 94.4\%, 92.9\% and 53.1\%, respectively, and these values for
   an SWE cutoff value of 7.6 kPa were 55.88\%, 100\%, 100\% and 44.4\%,
   respectively.
   Conclusion: In the clinical assessment of children, the APRI score and
   SWE can help differentiate between no or mild fibrosis and significant
   fibrosis. The routine use of SWE and APRI may help decrease the number
   of liver biopsies performed. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on

Title = {{Bioaccumulation of potentially toxic elements from the soils surrounding
   a legacy uranium mine in Brazil}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{261}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is important to understand the environmental fate and potential risks
   posed by metals and metalloids around mines and in legacy mining areas.
   In order to assess the bioavailable concentrations of several
   potentially toxic elements (PTEs: As, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, Cr, Mn, Zn, Ba, U)
   and rare earth elements (REEs: La to Lu), a multi-method evaluation of
   their concentrations/fractionation/speciation in soils was related to
   their biouptake in corn, for a region surrounding a legacy U mine in
   Brazil. Chemical fractions of the PTE and REE in soils were determined
   using the BCR (Community Bureau of Reference) sequential extraction
   procedure; a single extraction with Ca(NO3)(2) and the diffusion
   gradient in thin films (DGT) technique. All techniques were better
   correlated to the metals accumulated by the crops as compared to total
   metal concentrations. Ba, Cu, Mn and Zn were shown to have high mobility
   and high bioaccumulation factors in the corn. Concentrations of U, As,
   Cd, and Pb were above threshold concentrations and strongly correlated,

Abstract = {{Honey from the western region of Parana receives the seal of origin and
   in-process denomination of origin because it is mostly produced in
   permanent preservation areas, adherence to hygiene and sanitary
   standards, proper management techniques and agro-industrial management.
   The objective of this study was to verify the microbiological quality of
   honey produced by beekeepers associated with Cooperative. Sixty-seven
   honey samples were evaluated for microbiological quality, and the mean
   values observed to total aerobic mesophiles were 2.52 log CFU/g;
   Clostridium spp. 1.46 log CFU/g; total coliforms 0.78 log CFU/g; fecal
   coliforms 0.50 log CFU/g; total yeasts 0.46 log CFU/g, and 2.95 log
   CFU/g total molds. The evaluations showed the incidence of anaerobic
   mesophilic in 70\% of the samples, Clostridium spp. 77\%; total
   coliforms 60\%, fecal coliforms 62\%, molds 83\% and 34\% yeasts. Five
   genera of the isolated molds commonly found in honey were Fusarium spp.
   0.35 log CFU/g; Aspergillus spp. 0.52 log CFU/g; Cladosporium spp. 1.2
   log CFU/g, Phoma spp. 0.71 log CFU/g and 0.16 log CFU/g Penicillium spp.
   Multivariate analysis showed the formation of two groups and indicated
   the heterogeneity in the bacterial load of the samples. Although
   microbiological analyses were not mandatory for honey, these results
   demonstrated the hygienic-sanitary quality of the samples of honey
   produced. For the reduction of secondary-origin microorganisms, the
   handlers were recommended to follow the sanitary hygiene norms and
   handling techniques.}},

Title = {{The effect of traditional healer intervention prior to allopathic care
   on pediatric burn mortality in Malawi}},
Journal = {{BURNS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1952-1957}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Burn injury is a significant contributor to mortality,
   especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Patients in many
   communities throughout sub-Saharan Africa use traditional health
   practitioners for burn care prior to seeking evaluation at an allopathic
   burn center. The World Health Organization defines a traditional health
   practitioner as ``a person who is recognized by the community where he
   or she lives as someone competent to provide health care by using plant,
   animal and mineral substances and other methods based on social,
   cultural and religious practices based on indigenous knowledge and
   belief system.{''} The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence
   of prior traditional health practitioner treatment and assess its effect
   on burn injury mortality. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the
   prospectively collected Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) Burn Surveillance
   Registry was performed from January 2009 through July 2017. Pediatric
   patients (<13 years) who were injured with flame or scald burns were
   included in the study and we compared groups based on patient or family
   reported use of traditional health practitioners prior to evaluation at
   Kamuzu Central Hospital. We used propensity score weighted multivariate
   logistic regression to identify the association with mortality after
   visiting a traditional healer prior to hospitalization. Results: 1689
   patients were included in the study with a mean age of 3.3 years (SD
   2.7) and 55.9\% were male. Mean percent total body surface area of burn
   was 16.4\% (SD 12.5\%) and most burns were related to scald injuries
   (72.4\%). 184 patients (10.9\%) used traditional medicine prior to
   presentation. Only a delay in presentation was associated with prior
   traditional health practitioner use. After propensity weighted score
   matching, the odds ratio of mortality after using a prior traditional
   health practitioner was 1.91 (95\% CI 1.09, 3.33). Conclusion: The use
   of traditional health practitioners prior to presentation at a tertiary
   burn center is associated with an increased odds of mortality after burn
   injury. These effects may be independent of the potential harms
   associated with a delay in definitive care. Further work is needed to
   delineate strategies for integrating with local customs and building
   improved networks for burn care, especially in rural areas. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{Polyunsaturated fatty acids and alpha-tocopherol were encapsulated in
   powders by spray drying using maltodextrins DE 12 as wall material and
   different emulsifiers (Tween(R)20, acacia gum or beta-glucans-rich
   extracts from Pleurotus ostreatus). The aim was to study the effects of
   the surfactants on: (a) the oil droplet size distribution and
   alpha-tocopherol stability during in vitro digestion, and (b) the
   oxidative stability during 15 days of accelerated storage. Acacia gum
   sample had the most stable particle size distribution up to the gastric
   phase, but showed a significant alpha-tocopherol degradation prior to
   the intestinal stage. On the contrary, beta-glucan-samples displayed a
   bimodal distribution in the oral and gastric phases but retained
   alpha-tocopherol up to the beginning of the intestinal stage. At the end
   of intestinal stage, no alpha-tocopherol was found in the samples. The
   storage study showed that beta-glucans improved the oxidative stability
   of the powders, which displayed 82\% alpha-tocopherol retention after 5
   days under accelerated conditions (60 degrees C), corresponding to 310
   days at 20 degrees C, while acacia gum and Tween(R) 20 did not delay
   alpha-tocopherol degradation. Results highlight the potential
   antioxidant activity of beta-glucans used as emulsifying agents during
   in vitro digestion and accelerated aging conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   Our objective was to assess unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) as biomarker
   for schizophrenia (SCZ) and schizoaffective (SAF) spectrums disorder
   (relapse vs. partial remission).
   Methods
   Eighty-eight psychotic patients completed first assessment during
   relapse at ward admission, half with SCZ and half with SAF disorder.
   Forty-four acute bipolar patients were used as controls. After 12-month
   follow-up, we collected longitudinal protocol (laboratory,
   psychopathological, and psychosocial data) from 60 patients, half with
   SCZ and half with SAF disorder.
   Results
   During psychotic relapse (N = 88), we found a statistically significant
   difference (analysis of variance {[}ANOVA]; p = .002), confirmed after
   post hoc multiple comparisons (Bonferroni) between SCZ (N = 44) and both
   SAF (N = 44; p = .05) and bipolar controls (N = 44; p = .05); a positive
   correlation (Pearson's r = .314) between UCB mean levels and Personal
   and Social Performance item (d) ``disturbing and aggressive
   behaviors{''}; and a positive correlation (R (2) = .223), with
   statistically significance (p = .008), between UCB mean levels and mean
   length of stay at the psychiatric ward in SAF patients who completed
   full protocol (N = 30). During partial remission (N = 60) we found: a
   statistically significant difference (ANOVA; p = .006), confirmed after
   post hoc multiple comparisons (Bonferroni) between SCZ (N = 30) and SAF
   (N = 30; p = .05); plus a negative correlation (Pearson's r = -.399)
   between UCB mean levels and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale item G7
   ``psychomotor retardation.{''} Comparing first and second assessments
   (paired samples t test) we found a statistically significant difference
   in UCB mean levels among SAF patients (p = .034).
   Conclusions
   There is potential in the research of UCB as a biological marker for SCZ
   and SAF spectrums disorders during relapse and partial remission of both
   syndromes.}},

Title = {{Performance characteristics of a tungsten collimator and UVTRON flame
   sensor in the detection of alpha-induced radioluminescence}},
Journal = {{RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{177}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It has been established that the UVTRON flame sensor (Hamamatsu) can
   detect alpha-induced radioluminescence, but that the presence of gamma
   and beta radiation both interfere with this detection. A UVTRON was
   placed inside a tungsten collimator and exposed to a range of
   radioisotopes, Po-210, Am-241, Cs-137, Sr-90 and Co-60, to investigate
   the effect of shielding the UVTRON. The collimator is a cylinder with a
   hole in the curved wall to allow light and particles to access the
   interior, without providing a direct shine path to the UVTRON sensor.
   Ultraviolet C (wavelength 180-280 nm) radioluminescence is reflected
   onto the UVTRON sensor using a UVC reflecting mirror. It was found that
   the collimator does not affect the low background count of the UVTRON,
   but that it does greatly reduce the UVC signal reaching the UVTRON from
   an alpha source. For example, the collimator reduced the signal by 94\%
   at 60 mm, and 78\% at 120 mm, where the signals were still far greater
   than the background (88 and 84 times background respectively). Beta
   particles entering the collimator, although not directly impacting on
   the UVTRON, do increase the count, likely due to bremsstrahlung
   radiation. The collimator attenuates gamma radiation dependent on the
   gamma energy, but as expected, does not block it. When using more than
   one source, the count is cumulative and therefore it may be possible to
   determine the presence of UVC radioluminescence through subtraction of
   the gamma and beta element of the signal. The results and findings of
   the experiments carried out are presented herewithin.}},

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics against
   multidrug-resistant bacteria. Many antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are
   active against such bacteria and often act by destabilizing membranes, a
   mechanism that can also be used to permeabilize bacteria to other
   antibiotics, resulting in synergistic effects. We recently showed that
   G3KL, an AMP with a multibranched dendritic topology of the peptide
   chain, permeabilizes the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative
   bacteria including multidrug-resistant strains, leading to efficient
   bacterial killing. Here, we show that permeabilization of the outer and
   inner membranes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by G3KL, initially detected
   using the DNA-binding fluorogenic dye propidium iodide (PI), also leads
   to a synergistic effect between G3KL and PI in this bacterium. We also
   identify a synergistic effect between G3KL and six different antibiotics
   against the Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae, against which G3KL is
   inactive.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SHIP RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted on a laboratory-scale new infrared
   suppression (IRS) device to assess the mass entrainment of ambient air
   into it under various operating conditions. A numerical analysis was
   also undertaken to assess the mass entrainment rate against pertinent
   input parameters independently. The numerical results were validated
   against the experimental data to ensure the reliability of the numerical
   analysis of the new IRS device at real scales. The numerical method
   solves the three-dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations;
   the mass continuity equation; and the two-equation-based eddy viscosity
   model for the turbulent k-epsilon equations in the flow field. Numerical
   assessment of the air entrainment was performed for the conventional and
   the newly proposed IRS devices. A number of experiments on the new IRS
   device were carried out under various operating conditions. From the
   numerical study, it was observed that the conventional IRS device
   performs better than the new IRS device up to a geometric ratio of 1.4
   (which is the ratio of diameters of the successive funnels used in an
   IRS device). Beyond the geometric ratio of 1.4, the newly proposed IRS
   device outperforms the conventional one significantly. For the new IRS
   device, the maximum mass entrainment was found to occur when four
   funnels were used and the nozzle was kept in flush condition with the
   lower opening of the bottom-most funnel. Mass entrainment increases with
   the nozzle-exit Reynolds number for the range of values considered in
   the study.}},

Abstract = {{A new application of fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) with low cost and
   environmental friendliness is developed by incorporating them into
   polyvinyl butyral (PVB) polymer matrix. The introduction of CDs
   significantly enhances the mechanical properties of PVB. The yield
   strength, tensile strength, and adhesion strength are 200\%, 144\% and
   13-fold higher than those of pure PVB. Ultra-small size and abundant
   O-related groups endows CDs with superior affinity and strong binding
   force with PVB molecules, giving rise to the remarkable enhancement of
   PVB mechanical properties. Therefore, this work offers a promising
   substitute for PVB as interlayer materials of the automotive windshield.

   In this paper, we show that all etale (phi, tau)-modules are
   overconvergent; this answers a question of Caruso. Our result is an
   analogue of the classical overconvergence result of Cherbonnier and
   Colmez in the setting of etale (phi, Gamma)- modules. However, our
   method is completely different from theirs. Indeed, we first show that
   all p-power-torsion representations admit loose crystalline lifts; this
   allows us to construct certain Kisin models in these torsion

Abstract = {{Network function virtualization (NFV), with its perceived potential to
   accelerate service deployment and to introduce flexibility in service
   provisioning, has drawn a growing interest from industry and academia
   alike over the past few years. One of the key challenges in realizing
   NFV is the service chain routing problem, whereby traffic must be routed
   so as to traverse the various components of a network service that have
   been mapped onto the underlying network. In this work, we consider the
   online service chain routing problem. We route the service chain with
   the goal of jointly minimizing the maximum network congestion and the
   number of hops from the source to the destination. To this end, we
   present a simple yet effective online algorithm in which the routing
   decision is irrevocably made without prior knowledge of future requests.
   We prove that our algorithm is O(log m)-competitive in terms of
   congestion minimization, where m is the number of edges of the
   underlying network topology, and we show that this ratio is
   asymptotically optimal.}},

Title = {{The Design of Near-Perfect Spectrum-Selective Mirror Based on Photonic
   Structures for Passive Cooling of Silicon Solar Cells}},
Journal = {{NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{When exposed to sunlight, crystalline silicon solar cells (CSSC) will
   not only generate electric energy but are also heated by solar
   radiation. Such a self-heating effect makes the working temperature of
   CSSC 20-40 degrees C higher than that of the ambient temperature, which
   degrades their efficiency and reliability. The elevated operating
   temperatures of CSSC are mainly derived from absorbing photons that
   cannot be converted to electrons. Therefore, it is important to prevent
   CSSC from absorbing useless solar light to have a better cooling effect.
   In this paper, photonic structures based spectrum-selective mirror is
   designed to cool the operating temperatures of CSSC passively. The
   mirror could make CSSC absorb about 93\% of the sunlight in the
   wavelength range of 0.3 to 1.1 mu m and only absorb about 4\% of the
   sunlight in the wavelength range of 1.1 to 2.5 mu m. Meanwhile, the
   design has good compatibility with the radiative cooling strategy. By
   applying selective-absorptive and radiative cooling strategies, the
   operating temperature of CSSC could be decreased about 23.2 K and 68.1 K
   under different meteorological conditions. Moreover, unlike the single
   radiative cooling strategy, the spectrum-selective mirror also has
   effective cooling effects in high wind speed meteorological conditions.}},

Title = {{A k-core decomposition-based opinion leaders identifying method and

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Due to the development of network technology, large-scale group decision
   making (LSGDM) has become increasingly concerned. In this paper, a
   k-core decomposition-based opinion leaders identifying method and
   clustering-based consensus model are developed for LSGDM problems.
   Firstly, a clustering method based on similarity degree is provided for
   dividing decision makers (DMs) into several clusters. Then, sub-clusters
   are presented for social networks (SNs) construction process, which are
   consist of DMs with same alternative ranking information. Furthermore, a
   novel k-core decomposition-based opinion leaders identifying method is
   proposed for selecting opinion leaders of these SNs. Finally, the
   opinion leaders identified are applied to the following clustering-based
   consensus model in LSGDM. The weights of DMs are distributed
   appropriately and the group can efficiently reach a consensus based on
   the proposed social network analysis (SNA) methods and consensus
   reaching process (CRP). A case study on flood disaster management shows
   that the proposed methods are feasible for LSGDM problems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Depression is one of the most common forms of mental illness
   and also a leading cause of disability worldwide. Developing novel
   antidepressant targets beyond the monoaminergic systems is now popular
   and necessary. LIM kinases, including LIM domain kinase 1 and 2
   (LIMK1/2), play a key role in actin and microtubule dynamics through
   phosphorylating cofilin. Since depression is associated with atrophy of
   neurons and reduced connectivity, here we speculate that LIMK1/2 may
   play a role in the pathogenesis of depression.
   Methods: In this study, the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS),
   chronic restraint stress (CRS), and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)
   models of depression, various behavioral tests, stereotactic injection,
   western blotting, and immunofluorescence methods were adopted.
   Results: CUMS, CRS, and CSDS all significantly enhanced the
   phosphorylation levels of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in the medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC) but not the hippocampus of mice. Administration of
   fluoxetine, the most commonly used selective serotonin reuptake
   inhibitor in clinical practice, fully reversed the effects of CUMS, CRS,
   and CSDS on LIMK1 and LIMK2 in the mPFC. Moreover, pharmacological
   inhibition of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in the mPFC by LIMKi 3 infusions notably
   prevented the pro-depressant effects of CUMS, CRS, and CSDS in mice.
   Conclusions: In summary, these results suggest that LIMK1/2 in the mPFC
   has a role in chronic stress-induced depressive-like effects in mice and
   could be a novel pharmacological target for developing antidepressants.}},

Title = {{Relationship between parental psychological control and children's
   academic achievement in China: The role of children's failure mindsets}},
Journal = {{CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{119}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The research on the relationship between parental psychological control
   and children's academic achievement in East Asia is limited and has
   yielded inconsistent results. Based on family system theory, the current
   study examined the unique and interactive association between children's
   academic achievement with maternal and paternal psychological control.
   The moderating role of children's failure mindsets was also examined.
   The sample included 2583 Chinese primary children (1287 girls, 49.8\%,
   mean age = 10.33) and their parents (the mean ages were 35.97 for the
   mothers and 36.82 for the fathers). The results indicated that maternal
   and paternal psychological control were interactively linked to
   children's achievement. Specifically, the negative association between
   one parent's psychological control and the child's achievement was
   significant only when the other parent exerted a higher level of
   psychological control. The positions of fathers and mothers were
   similar. Moreover, the children's failure mindset was not only directly
   linked to achievement but also moderated the association with paternal
   psychological control. Children with higher debilitating failure
   mindsets (scored 1 SD above the mean) suffered more from paternal
   psychological control than those with lower debilitating failure
   mindsets (scored 1 SD below the mean.). The findings suggested that both
   the parenting and children's characteristics were associated with the
   children's academic performance. Future interventions might be more
   efficient from a family system perspective.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the dc filter design and optimization problem is
   studied for dc electrical power distribution systems onboard
   more-electric aircraft. Component sizing models are built to serve as
   the basis of the optimization whose objectives are mass and power loss
   of this filter. A categorization strategy of search and surrogate
   algorithms is proposed and used for the target multiobjective
   optimization problem (MOOP). A genetic algorithm is utilized as a search
   algorithm to identify potential best solutions based on a set of filter
   sizing functions (subject to constraints). In addition, two machine
   learning (ML) algorithms are considered as surrogate algorithms to
   address the same optimization problem. In the ML training process, a
   constraint violation model is applied since there are various
   constraints in optimization, and this kind of classification model is
   relatively difficult to train. A support vector machine is applied for
   the constraint violation model; after that, two artificial neural
   networks are trained as the final surrogate model for mapping design
   variables to filter performance. To address these issues, a novel
   category of search and surrogate algorithms is proposed. Both algorithms
   are explored to solve the filter MOOP, and their optimization results
   are compared at the end.}},

Title = {{Combining brine or CO2 geothermal preheating with low-temperature waste
   heat: A higher-efficiency hybrid geothermal power system}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CO2 UTILIZATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid geothermal power plants operate by using geothermal fluid to
   preheat the working fluid of a higher temperature power cycle for
   electricity generation. This has been shown to yield higher electricity
   generation than the combination of a stand-alone geothermal power plant
   and the higher-temperature power cycle. Here, we test both a direct CO2
   hybrid geothermal system and an indirect brine hybrid geothermal system.
   The direct CO2 hybrid geothermal system is a CO2 Plume Geothermal (CPG)
   system, which uses CO2 as the subsurface working fluid, but with
   auxiliary heat addition to the geologically produced CO2 at the surface.
   The indirect brine geothermal system uses the hot geologically produced
   brine to preheat the secondary working fluid (CO2) within a secondary
   power cycle. We find that the direct CPG-hybrid system and the indirect
   brine-hybrid system both can generate 20 \% more electric power than the
   summed power of individual geothermal and auxiliary systems in some
   cases. Each hybrid system has an optimum turbine inlet temperature which
   maximizes the electric power generated, and is typically between 100
   degrees C and 200 degrees C in the systems examined. The optimum turbine
   inlet temperature tends to occur where the geothermal heat contribution
   is between 50 \% and 70 \% of the total heat addition to the hybrid
   system. Lastly, the CO2 direct system has lower wellhead temperatures
   than indirect brine and therefore can utilize lower temperature
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated three neonatal Basset Hound littermates with lesions
   consistent with epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a group of genetic
   blistering diseases. A clinically normal bitch was bred to her
   grandfather by artificial insemination. Out of a litter of seven
   puppies, two affected puppies died and one was euthanized, with these
   puppies being submitted for diagnostic necropsy. All had multiple bullae
   and ulcers involving the nasal planum and paw pads, as well as sloughing
   claws; one puppy also had oral and esophageal ulcers. The complete
   genome of one affected puppy was sequenced, and 37 known EB candidate
   genes were assessed. We found a candidate causative variant in COL7A1,
   which encodes the collagen VII alpha 1 chain. The variant is a complex
   rearrangement involving duplication of a 107 bp region harboring a
   frameshift deletion of 7 bp. The variant is predicted to truncate more
   than 75\% of the open reading frame, p.(Val677Serfs{*}11). Targeted
   genotyping of this duplication confirmed that all three affected puppies
   were homozygous for the duplication, whereas 12 unaffected Basset Hounds
   did not carry the duplication. This variant was also not seen in the
   genomes of more than 600 dogs of other breeds. COL7A1 variants have been
   identified in humans and dogs with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa
   (DEB). The identified COL7A1 variant therefore most likely represents
   the causative variant and allows the refinement of the preliminary EB
   diagnosis to DEB.}},

Abstract = {{Trans{*} people frequently report attitudes of prejudice/transphobia in
   health professionals. Conversely, health professionals indicate the lack
   of adequate training to care for these people and its impact on the
   quality of care provided. Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the
   explicit prejudices/transphobia of health students and professionals and
   compare them with the general population in Tenerife. Methods: A
   descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out with the Genderism and
   Transphobia Scale (GTS) and the Negative Attitude towards Trans{*}
   people Scale (EANT) with a total of 602 participants. Results: We found
   a low mean level of explicit prejudice/transphobia, with little/no
   differences between occupation groups. Explicit transphobia was
   correlated with being a man, less educated, and heterosexual, and not
   personally knowing a trans{*} person. Men and women were less
   transphobic about trans{*} people whose identities coincided with their
   own. Conclusion: All participants showed a low mean level of explicit
   transphobia. This result is not incompatible with unconscious prejudice,
   which may translate to discriminatory behaviors. Interventions to change
   negative attitudes are still needed, since even a small percentage of
   transphobic health professionals could exert a considerable negative
   impact on health care. In professionals without transphobic attitudes,
   the barriers identified by trans{*} people might be a problem due to the
   lack of specific training.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the effects of long-term bilingualism on the
   production of filled pauses (FPs; e.g., uh, um, eh, em) in the speech of
   Afrikaans-Spanish bilinguals from Patagonia, Argentina. The instrumental
   analysis draws from a corpus of sociolinguistic interviews obtained from
   three speaker groups: L1-Afrikaans/L2-Spanish bilinguals;
   L1-Spanish-comparison speakers, also from Patagonia; and
   L1-Afrikaans-comparison speakers from South Africa. In the data
   analysis, we examined relative FP usage (categorical outcomes), as well
   as phonetic measures of vowel quality and segmental duration (continuous
   outcomes). The results allude to multiple patterns of cross-language
   influence (e.g., L1-to-L2 influence, L2-to-L1 influence, bidirectional
   influence), which depend on the phonetic measure explored. Overall, the
   findings suggest that the patterns of cross-language phonetic influence
   observed in the L2 learning of traditionally understood lexical items
   likewise hold in the L2 learning of hesitation markers such as FPs.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Differential diagnosis between ischemic and hemorrhagic
   strokes in the acute stage is one of the major challenges of
   neurovascular research. Several biomarkers have been studied, but
   attempts to date have focused on determining their blood levels.
   Recently, cerebral lymphatic drainage toward the nostrils has been
   discovered, giving us the chance to study nasal exudate looking for
   biomarkers of neural damage. We sought to confirm whether iron levels in
   nasal exudate could identify the hemorrhagic nature of acute stroke.
   Methods: We studied iron nasal exudate levels in 32 ischemic and 43
   hemorrhagic stroke patients. All patients underwent neurological
   examination assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
   (NIHSS), brain computed tomography to the differential diagnosis of
   stroke subtype, laboratory tests, and measurement of iron levels in
   nasal exudate. Results: The iron levels in nasal exudate were higher in
   hemorrhagic stroke patients. The area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve for ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke discrimination was
   0.896 (95\% confidence interval 0.823-0.970) and cutoff point of 0.078
   nmol/mg (sensitivity 93\%, specificity 73\%). Conclusions: Our findings
   suggest that iron levels in nasal exudate may be useful in the acute
   stage for the differential diagnosis between ischemic and hemorrhagic
   damage in acute stroke patients. They also open a potential field to
   study other biomarkers in nasal exudate in several neurological
   disorders. Clinical studies must be performed to confirm our results.}},

Abstract = {{Studies are scarce on the nutritional and phytochemical composition of
   wild edible Mediterranean plants after culinary processing. This work
   provides the nutritional composition after culinary treatment (including
   dietary fiber and mineral composition) and bioactive compounds (folates,

   (Moench) Garcke. leaves, and wild Asparagus acutifolius L., Bryonia
   dioica Jacq., Humulus lupulus L., Tamus communis L. young shoots. Shoots
   better preserved their nutrients than leaves, due to their different
   tissue structure. Fresh and cooked wild greens present high dietary
   fiber values, and remained at remarkable levels after boiling. Na, K, Mg
   and Zn were lost in about 50\% due to culinary processing, while Ca, Cu,
   Fe and Mn were more stable. Boiled leaves of S. vulgaris remained as a
   good Mn source. A portion of 100 g of most of the cooked analyzed
   species could cover a relevant percentage of the daily requirement of
   folates (R. pulcher and A. acutifolius providing more than 80\%) and

Abstract = {{Background
   The clinical consequences and factors related to the progression from a
   carotid near-occlusion (CNO) to a complete occlusion are not well
   established. Our aim is to describe the rate, predictive factors and
   clinical implications of the progression to complete carotid occlusion
   (PCCO) in a population of patients with symptomatic CNO.
   Methods
   We conducted a multicenter, nationwide, prospective study from January
   2010 to May 2016. Patients with angiography-confirmed CNO were included.
   We collected information on demographic data, clinical manifestations,
   radiological and hemodynamic findings, and treatment modalities. A 24
   month carotid-imaging follow-up of the CNO was performed.
   Results
   141 patients were included in the study, and carotid-imaging follow-up
   was performed in 122 patients. PCCO occurred in 40 patients (32.8\%),
   and was more frequent in medically-treated patients (34 out of 61;
   55.7\%) compared with patients treated with revascularization (6 out of
   61; 9.8\%) (p<0.001). 7 of the 40 patients with PCCO (17.5\%) suffered
   ipsilateral symptoms. Factors independently related with PCCO in the
   multivariate analysis were: age >= 75 years (OR 2.93, 95\% CI 1.05 to
   8.13), revascularization (OR 0.07, 95\% CI 0.02 to 0.20), and collateral
   circulation through the ipsilateral ophthalmic artery (OR 3.25, 95\% CI
   1.01 to 10.48).
   Conclusions
   PCCO occurred within 24 months in more than half of the patients under
   medical treatment. Most episodes of PCCO were not associated with
   ipsilateral symptoms. Revascularization reduces the risk of PCCO.}},

Title = {{A Novel Nanoproteomic Approach for the Identification of Molecular
   Targets Associated with Thyroid Tumors}},
Journal = {{NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A thyroid nodule is the most common presentation of thyroid cancer;
   thus, it is extremely important to differentiate benign from malignant
   nodules. Within malignant lesions, classification of a thyroid tumor is
   the primary step in the assessment of the prognosis and selection of
   treatment. Currently, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the
   preoperative test most commonly used for the initial thyroid nodule
   diagnosis. However, due to some limitations of FNAB, different
   high-throughput ``omics{''} approaches have emerged that could further
   support diagnosis based on histopathological patterns. In the present
   work, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens from
   normal (non-neoplastic) thyroid (normal controls (NCs)), benign tumors
   (follicular thyroid adenomas (FTAs)), and some common types of
   well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (follicular thyroid carcinomas
   (FTCs), conventional or classical papillary thyroid carcinomas
   (CV-PTCs), and the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas
   (FV-PTCs)) were analyzed. For the first time, FFPE thyroid samples were
   deparaffinized using an easy, fast, and non-toxic method. Protein
   extracts from thyroid tissue samples were analyzed using a
   nanoparticle-assisted proteomics approach combined with shotgun
   LC-MS/MS. The differentially regulated proteins found to be specific for
   the FTA, FTC, CV-PTC, and FV-PTC subtypes were analyzed with the
   bioinformatic tools STRING and PANTHER showing a profile of proteins

Abstract = {{Rainfall variability and water scarcity continue to hamper the food and
   income security of smallholder farming systems in poverty-affected
   regions. Innovations in soil and water management, especially in the
   drylands, are critical for meeting food security and water productivity
   targets of Agenda 2030. This study analyzes how rainfed agriculture can
   be intensified with marginal impact on the landscape water balance. The
   impact of rainwater harvesting structures on landscape hydrology and
   associated agricultural services was analyzed in the semi-arid Jhansi
   district of Bundelkhand region in central India. The Parasai-Sindh pilot
   watershed was subjected to a 5-year (2012-2016) monitoring of rainfed
   system improvements in water availability and crop intensification due
   to surface water storage (haveli system), check dams, and field
   infiltration structures. Hydrological processes were monitored
   intensively to analyze the landscape's water balance components.
   Rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures altered the landscape's hydrology,
   limiting average surface runoff from 250 mm/year to 150 mm/year over the
   study period. Groundwater levels increased by 2-5 m (m), alleviating
   water scarcity issues of the communities in recurring dry years. Nearly
   20\% of fallow lands were brought under cultivation. Crop yields
   increased by 10-70\% and average household income increased from US\$
   960/year to US \$ 2700/year compared to that in the non-intervention
   landscape. The combined soil-water-vegetation efforts strengthened water
   resilience and environmental systems in agricultural landscape.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A new sorption-based thermal storage cycle is proposed. Energy is stored
   chemically by separating the constituents of highly non-ideal solutions,
   yielding much lower stand-by losses than in conventional approaches. The
   cycle avoids limitations of previously proposed sorption-based storage
   cycles by using a liquid-liquid mixer, and does not require a thermal
   source during discharge. A criterion based on a second law analysis is
   developed to evaluate potential working fluids for the cycle. Different
   cycle configurations are analyzed. An enhanced combined sorption and
   phase-change material (PCM) cycle is also investigated and compared with
   conventional thermal storage systems. For delivering 100 GJ of energy
   after 8 months, the combined cycle has an efficiency of 11\% and lower
   storage volumes (down to 0.1 x) than conventional thermal storage
   technologies. The energy density of the combined sorption-PCM system is
   30 kWh m (- 3).}},

Title = {{Multi-objective optimisation and planning of grid-connected cogeneration
   systems in presence of grid power fluctuations and energy storage
   dynamics}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{212}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, multi-generation systems (MGS) have been at the centre
   of attention for incorporating various energy sources and technologies
   to provide a reliable and sustainable energy supply. However, deciding
   on the most suitable configuration and optimal operation strategy of
   MGSs has always been a challenging issue due to the nonlinear and
   complex interactions between different energy converters. Cogeneration
   solutions offer excellent energy efficiency through the coproduced heat
   from the electricity generation process. This will lead to significant
   economic profitability compared to conventional independent heat and
   power production plants. This paper presents a mixed-integer quadratic
   based multi-objective structural design strategy for grid-connected
   cogeneration systems comprising combined heat and power (CHP) devices,
   ancillary boiler, and energy storage devices in presence of nonlinear
   and dynamic behaviour of the energy storage systems. The power
   fluctuations smoothing index (PFSI) and energy storage depreciation
   factor (ESDF) are defined to effectively mitigate the power grid
   fluctuations and extend the lifetime of the energy storage systems.
   Presenting three case scenarios, the obtained results demonstrate the
   efficacy and applicability of the developed technique and reflect the
   impact of the introduced factors on the optimal configuration and
   operation of cogeneration systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Within the context of school-based physical education (PE), a strength
   and conditioning program called CrossFit Kids (CFK) has emerged as a
   potential intervention for positively impacting students. The purpose of
   this study was to evaluate through a randomized-controlled trial how
   academic and health-related fitness outcomes dif-fered for middle school
   students (age = 12.73; 55.3 \% male) who participated in a school-based
   CFK program (n=72) as compared to a group of students who participated
   in PE class (n=72). Questionnaire data were collected twice across the
   9-month academic year and combined with FitnessGram and grade data.
   Students in both the intervention and comparison groups increased in
   health-related fitness outcomes (all p values < .017), and there was a
   significant treatment group by time interaction on school-reported
   grades {[}F(1, 124) = 7.270, p = .008, eta\_P<\^{}>2 = .055].
   Significant gender by time interaction effects were found for the
   relationship between CFK or PE participation and health-related fitness
   outcomes, but there were no significant interaction effects by gender on
   academic outcomes. Because developmental outcomes are conditional and
   result from the coaction of many factors, the findings suggest that some
   elements of CFK might be beneficial to build skills yet disadvantageous
   to academic outcomes.}},

   survey recent Iraqi historiographical literature to reveal the ways in

Abstract = {{This paper describes polarimetric strategies based on measuring the
   light's geometric phase, which results from the evolution of the
   polarisation state while traversing an optical system. The system in
   question is described by a homogeneous Jones matrix, which by
   definition, contains mutually perpendicular eigenpolarisations. Our
   leading theory links the system's Jones matrix parameters (eigenvalues
   and eigenvectors) with the input polarisation state and the geometric
   phase. We demonstrate two interferometric techniques. The first one
   measures the geometric phase based on the relative lateral fringe
   displacement between the interference pattern of two mutually-orthogonal
   polarisation states. The second technique uses the visibility of the
   interference fringes to determine the eigenpolarisations of the system.
   We present proof-of-principle experiments for both techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of markers reflecting cardiac autonomic activity before and
   during stressful situations may be useful for identifying the
   physiological state of an athlete and may have medical or performance
   implications. The study aimed to determine group and individual changes
   in short-term (5 min) and ultra-short-term (1 min) heart rate (HR),
   respiratory rate (RespRate), and time-domain heart rate variability
   (HRV) parameters during sympathetic nervous system activity (SNSa)
   stimulation among professional endurance athletes. Electrocardiographic
   recordings were performed in stable measurement conditions (Baseline)
   and during SNSa stimulation via isometric handgrip in 12 elite modern
   pentathlonists. Significant increases in short-term HR and decreases in
   time-domain HRV parameters with no changes in RespRate were observed
   during SNSa stimulation. Significant differences were observed between
   Baseline (all minutes) and the last (i.e., 5th) minute of SNSa
   stimulation for ultra-short-term parameters. Analysis of
   intra-individual changes revealed some heterogeneity in responses. The
   study provides baseline responses of HR, RespRate, and time-domain HRV
   parameters to SNSa stimulation among elite pentathlonists, which may be
   useful for identifying abnormal responses among fatigued or injured
   (e.g., concussed) athletes. More attention to individual analysis seems
   to be necessary when assessing physiological responses to sympathetic
   stimuli in professional endurance athletes.}},

Title = {{Electrochemical Evaluation of Laccase Activity in Must}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As laccase (produced by Botrytis cinerea) can significantly alter the
   properties of wine, winemakers frequently use commercially available
   colorimetric kits and spectrophotometers to measure the activity of this
   enzyme in grapes, must and wine. Although the used kits are based on
   electrochemically active substrates (such as syringaldazine and 2,2
   `-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), ABTS), the
   electrochemical determination of laccase activity as an alternative to
   the colorimetric determination was not thoroughly investigated up to
   now. Therefore, in the present work, we explored the electrochemical
   determination of laccase activity. Laccase activity measurements were
   carried out using either carbon fiber microelectrodes or screen-printed
   electrodes as working electrodes, either syringaldazine or ABTS as the
   electrochemically active laccase substrate, and either cyclic
   voltammetry or constant potential amperometry as the electrochemical
   method. The best performing approach, which combines ABTS,
   screen-printed gold electrodes, and constant potential amperometry,
   allowed identifying laccase positive must sample (i.e., must samples
   with (sic) 3U/mL laccase) in about 5 min.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the types of questions that prospective teachers
   of mathematics asked their students during whole-class discussions, how
   these questions changed over time, and why. Four prospective teachers
   were interviewed at the beginning and end of a 10-week period of student
   teaching to elicit their views about the kinds of questions mathematics
   teachers should ask. One lesson per week, for eight lessons, was video
   recorded for each prospective teacher. These videos were analyzed for
   the kinds of questions the prospective teachers asked and the nature of
   the responses from their high-school students. We found that the
   prospective teachers initially expressed the view that it was important
   to ask questions that required students to explain their thinking-a view
   that aligned with what was promoted in their teacher-preparation
   program-and that they attempted to ask questions with unpredictable
   answers in the early weeks. Over time, however, they asked fewer
   questions overall, with an even greater reduction in the number of
   questions with unpredictable answers. Interviews revealed that the
   prospective teachers' views about what kinds of questions to ask were
   influenced, over time, by the responses of their students. The videos
   offered additional insights into the nature of the students' responses.}},

Title = {{Healthy Hands: a pilot study for the prevention of chronic hand eczema

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers are at risk for occupational chronic hand
   eczema (CHE) because of frequent handwashing and prolonged use of
   occlusive gloves. Prevention programs based on skin care education have
   been shown to be beneficial. We developed and assessed the efficacy of a
   skin care educational intervention for healthcare workers of our
   hospital.
   METHODS: The intervention consisted of two sessions, one week apart,
   each divided in a theoretical and a practical part, focusing on the skin
   barrier, types of eczema, risk factors for CHE, hand hygiene measures
   respectful of the skin, proper use of protective gloves and emollient
   creams. Its efficacy was assessed by a questionnaire, administered
   before and after the intervention, investigating the participants'
   knowledge of risk factors for CHE and risk behaviors.
   RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects, mostly (65.2\%) nurses, took part in the
   intervention; 60.9\% had a self-reported atopic background and 65.2\%
   participants reported a history of CHE. The intervention improved
   significantly the participants' knowledge on CHE risk factors, i.e.
   frequent handwashing (P=0.023), surgical scrubbing (P=0.016) and
   prolonged glove wearing (P=0.022). The frequency of hand washing was
   significantly reduced (P=0.022). The participants gave a positive
   unanimous feedback.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our intervention was effective, by significantly improving
   the participants' knowledge and by inducing significant behavioral
   changes. Improving the formulation of alcoholic hand rubs may be a key
   factor to encourage their use. Coexisting nonoccupational risk behaviors
   are just as important in the prevention of CHE.}},

Title = {{Optimal design of cold-formed steel lipped channel beams: Combined
   bending, shear, and web crippling}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The load carrying capacity of cold-formed steel (CFS) beams can be
   enhanced by employing optimisation techniques. Recent research studies
   have mainly focused on optimising the bending capacity of the CFS beams
   for a given amount of material. However, to the best of authors'
   knowledge, very limited research has been performed to optimise the CFS
   beams subject to shear and web crippling actions for a given amount of
   material. This paper presents the optimisation of CFS lipped channel
   beams for maximum bending, shear, and web crippling actions combined,
   leading to a novel conceptual development. The bending, shear and web
   crippling strengths of the sections were determined based on the
   provisions in Eurocode 3, while the optimisation process was performed
   by the means of Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) method. Combined
   theoretical and manufacturing constraints were imposed during the
   optimisation to ensure the practicality of optimised CFS beams.
   Non-linear Finite Element (FE) analysis with imperfections was employed
   to simulate the structural behaviour of optimised CFS lipped channel
   beams after successful validation against previous experimental results.
   The results demonstrated that, the optimised CFS sections are more
   effective (bending, shear, and web crippling actions resulted in 30\%,
   6\%, and 13\% of capacity increase, respectively) compared to the
   conventional CFS sections with same amount of material (weight). The
   proposed optimisation framework can be used to enhance the structural
   efficiency of CFS lipped channel beams under combined bending, shear,
   and web crippling actions.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To determine the volumes altered during photorefractive
   keratectomy (PRK), laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), and small
   incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) correction of myopia and myopic
   astigmatism.
   METHODS: The volumes of stromal tissue affected by surgical correction
   of pure and astigmatic myopia were calculated in this theoretical study
   for PRK, LASIK, and SMILE treatments. These results were then used to
   calculate representative values for percent volume altered (PVA)
   restricted to stromal corneal tissue.
   RESULTS: For the same spherical equivalent, there were remarkable
   differences between the amount of tissue removed between pure and
   compound myopic corrections. The PVA of LASIK procedures was the
   largest, whereas the PVA was comparable between PRK and SMILE. PRK had
   the lowest PVA for tow myopic and compound astigmatic corrections and
   SMILE had the lowest PVA for high myopic and compound myopic astigmatism
   procedures.
   CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of volumes of tissue removed and PVA values
   of different treatment modalities provided in this study may give
   clinicians an improved understanding about the potential influence of
   geometrical parameters of those methods on the biomechanics of the

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: ultrasound is considered to be the primary
   tool for preoperative assessment of ovarian masses; however, the
   discrimination of borderline ovarian tumours (BOTs) is challenging, and
   depends highly on the experience of the sonographer. The Assessment of
   Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX) model is considered to be a
   valuable diagnostic tool for preoperative assessment of ovarian masses;
   however, its performance for BOTs has not been widely studied, due to
   the low prevalence of these tumours. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the performance of ADNEX model for preoperative diagnosis of
   BOTs. Methods: retrospective analysis of preoperative ultrasound
   datasets of patients diagnosed with BOTs on the final histology after
   performed surgery was done at a tertiary oncogynaecology centre during
   the period of 2012-2018. Results: 85 patients were included in the
   study. The performance of ADNEX model based on absolute risk (AR)
   improved with the selection of a more inclusive cut-off value, varying
   from 47 (60.3\%) correctly classified cases of BOTs, with the selected
   cut-off of 20\%, up to 67 (85.9\%) correctly classified cases of BOTs
   with the cut-off value of 3\%. When relative risk (RR) was used to
   classify the tumours, 59 (75.6\%) cases were identified correctly. Forty
   (70.2\%) cases of serous and 16 (72.7\%) cases of mucinous BOTs were
   identified when AR with a 10\% cut-off value was applied, compared to 44
   (77.2\%) and 15 (68.2\%) cases of serous and mucinous BOTs, correctly
   classified by RR. The addition of Ca125 improved the performance of
   ADNEX model for all BOTs in general, and for different subtypes of BOTs.
   However, the differences were insignificant. Conclusions: The
   International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) ADNEX model performs well
   in discriminating BOTs from other ovarian tumours irrespective of the
   subtype. The calculation based on RR or AR with the cut-off value of at
   least 10\% should be used when evaluating for BOTs.}},

Abstract = {{The first results of studying the Ar/CO2/HFO1234ze eco-friendly gas
   mixture for gas discharge detectors are presented. The work is performed
   using a prototype multiwire proportional chamber of the muon system of
   the CMS experiment at the LHC. The detector performance was studied in
   the accelerated aging mode under irradiation by a Sr-90 source. The
   accumulated charge was 1.2 C cm(-1), which is equivalent to almost 100
   years of operation of the muon system's chambers at an increased LHC
   luminosity of L = 5 x 10(34) cm(-2) s(-1). The degradation of the gas
   gain in the irradiated zone at a level of 15\% is noted only after the
   accumulation of similar to 1.0 C cm(-1) of charge. The result suggests
   that the gas mixtures with HFO1234ze look promising for use in wire gas
   discharge detectors.}},

Abstract = {{(1) Background: The evaluation of ventricular assist devices requires
   the usage of biocompatible and chemically stable materials. The commonly
   used polyurethanes are characterized by versatile properties making them
   well suited for heart prostheses applications, but simultaneously they
   show low stability in biological environments. (2) Methods: An
   innovative material-copolymer of poly(ethylene-terephthalate) and dimer
   linoleic acid-with controlled and reproducible physico-mechanical and
   biological properties was developed for medical applications.
   Biocompatibility (cytotoxicity, surface thrombogenicity, hemolysis, and
   biodegradation) were evaluated. All results were compared to medical
   grade polyurethane currently used in the extracorporeal heart
   prostheses. (3) Results: No cytotoxicity was observed and no significant
   decrease of cells density as well as no cells growth reduction was
   noticed. Thrombogenicity analysis showed that the investigated
   copolymers have the thrombogenicity potential similar to medical grade
   polyurethane. No hemolysis was observed (the hemolytic index was under
   2\% according to ASTM 756-00 standard). These new materials revealed
   excellent chemical stability in simulated body fluid during 180 days
   aging. (4) Conclusions: The biodegradation analysis showed no changes in
   chemical structure, molecular weight distribution, good thermal
   stability, and no changes in surface morphology. Investigated copolymers
   revealed excellent biocompatibility and great potential as materials for
   blood contacting devices.}},

   of this research was to survey and describe the perception about
   emotions, sociodemographic, institutional, psycho-physical,

   through a Google form and the Moodle platform, to 337 higher education
   students between 18 to 35 years old, males and females. Preliminary
   results: Since the implementation of remote education is still in force,
   it is pertinent to make a brief assessment of the most frequent
   perceived emotions. There are also references to some expectations and
   to the opinion regarding whether it is convenient to continue with this
   learning modality. Preliminary conclusions: Such a novel situation that
   goes on over time, in a context of uncertainty and constant
   postponements, necessarily impacts on the psychological well-being and
   the evaluation of one's own freedoms. Stress, worry and anxiety are some
   of the emerging perceptions in individuals who are still not very clear
   that distance learning is totally valid for them.}},

   Objective: To measure the involvement of dependence in social loneliness
   in the population of 65 years and older of the Penamellera Alta office.
   Material and methods: A descriptive observational study was carried out
   in this population. For which we developed a questionnaire that included
   various demographic variables, the East II Scale to mediate the level of
   social loneliness, the Lawton and Brody Index and the Barthel Index. Chi
   square, ANOVA and non-parametric tests were used for the analysis and
   SPSS Statistic version 21 was used for this.
   Results / Conclusions: It was obtained that the older; the greater the
   percentage of people with social loneliness (21,6\% 65-69 years, 38,6\%
   70-79 years and 65,6\% 80 years and more). There are more people with
   social loneliness among those who are dependent for ADL (64,7\%). The
   older the number of dependents increases for ADLs (4,3\% 65-69 years,
   29,5\% 70-79 years and 62,5\% 80 years and over). Men are more dependent
   for IADL (59,5\%).
   With these results, we can objectify some problems that will increase
   with the aging of the population and that affect groups at risk.}},

Abstract = {{The duality in China's traffic planning has given rise to the basic unit
   of urban form and function called the superblock, which is defined and
   bound by an arterial street network. The street network of China's
   superblock underpins the coexistence and interaction of global and local
   movement, the public and daily space, and affects place diversity and
   local characteristics. However, its configuration remains to be
   articulated because of the lack of a systematic representation method,
   and the associations between configuration and performance, cognition
   and design cannot be determined. This study proposes an improved
   representation method for the street network of China's superblocks
   based on Marshall's route structure analysis to explore the
   configurational characteristics and sustainability of the network. To
   fit local conditions, this study improves Marshall's route structure
   analysis from four perspectives, namely, the judgement of relative
   hierarchy, the node construction principle, and the deletion and
   addition of the original indicators. The improved method is then applied
   to calculate and compare the depth, connectivity, and complexity of the
   street networks of 10 sample super blocks in Nanjing, which are
   classified into six types by construction backgrounds, each having two
   scenarios differing by the level of publicity. Results indicate that the
   types formed in accordance with the ``The Capital Plan{''} of the
   Republic of China, which presents a combination of fine orthogonal grids
   and radiations, and by the renewal of the traditional street-and lane
   network, which has the ``characteristic structure{''} defined by
   Marshall, perform best in terms of configurational sustainability. The
   analysis also reveals that the addition of semipublic streets formed
   mainly from the bottom up narrows the sustainability gap among the
   samples. This study provides a tool for elaborate urban study and design
   and provides insights into the cognitive and practical aspects of
   China's urban planning and design. (C) 2020 Higher Education Press

   efforts to align childcare and other needs with the unpredictable nature
   of rotating shift work. The causal link between breast cancer and the
   sleep cycle or circadian disruption are yet to be established; however,
   disruption of the circadian cycles by light at night exposure or chronic
   exposure to stress-related mediators have all been linked to the
   increased risk of breast cancer. We review the existing literature on

Abstract = {{Recent observations have found a 1700 km s(-1) star {[}S5-HVS1] that was
   ejected from the Galactic center approximately five million years ago.
   This star was likely produced by the tidal disruption of a binary. In
   particular, the Galactic center contains a few million year old stellar
   disk that could excite binaries to nearly radial orbits via a secular
   gravitational instability. Such binaries would be disrupted by the
   central supermassive black hole, and would also explain the observed
   cluster of B stars similar to 0.01 pc from the Galactic center. In this
   paper we predict S5-HVS1 is part of a larger stream, and use
   observationally motivated N-body simulations to predict its spatial and
   velocity distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids offer a promising opportunity for achieving greater use of
   renewable generation. In this paper, we consider optimal capacity design
   for an islanded microgrid supplied by a wind turbine, solar panel and
   battery system. The objective is to reduce plant cost while ensuring
   energy sufficiency, taking into account stochasticity of renewable
   generation and load. An affine control policy is designed to dispatch
   battery power under uncertain renewable in-feed and load. The policy is
   integrated into a stochastic chance-constrained optimization problem,
   which is solved using a probabilistically robust method. In order to
   address conservativeness inherent in the robust method, we develop two
   approaches to set reshaping that reduce the volume of the robust set,
   thereby enabling less conservative designs.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to compare soleus, lateral, and medial
   gastrocnemius muscles activation during leg press and calf raise
   exercises in trained men. The study involved 22 trained men (27.1 +/-
   3.6 years, 82.7 +/- 6.6 kg, 177.5 +/- 5.2 cm, 3.6 +/- 1.4 experience
   years) who performed one set of each exercise using a 10-repetition
   maximum (10RM) load in a counterbalanced randomized order and separated
   by 10 min of rest. The electromyographic signal was measured for the
   three major plantar flexors: soleus, medial, and lateral gastrocnemius.
   A comparison between exercises showed that the mean adjusted by peak
   values during the leg press were 49.20\% for the gastrocnemius
   lateralis, 51.31\% for the gastrocnemius medialis, and 50.76\% for the
   soleus. Values for calf raise were 50.70\%, 52.19\%, and 51.34\% for the
   lateral, medial gastrocnemius, and soleus, respectively. There were no
   significant differences between exercises for any muscle (lateral
   gastrocnemius (p = 0.230), medial gastrocnemius (p = 0.668), and soleus
   (p = 0.535)). The present findings suggest that both leg press and calf
   raises can be used with the purpose to recruit triceps surae muscles.
   This bring the suggestion that one can chose between exercises based on
   personal preferences and practical aspects, without any negative impact
   on muscle activation.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Drought is one of the extreme climatic events that has a severe impact
   on crop production and food supply. Our main goal is to test the
   suitability of remote sensing-based indices to detect drought impacts on
   crop production from a global to regional scale. Moderate resolution
   imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) based imagery, spanning from 2001 to
   2017 was used for this task. This includes the normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), and the
   evaporative stress index (ESI), which is based on the ratio of actual to
   potential evapotranspiration. These indices were used as indicators of
   drought-induced vegetation conditions for three main crops: maize,
   wheat, and soybean. The start and end of the growing season, as observed
   at 500 m resolution, were used to exclude the time steps that are
   outside of the growing season. Based on the three indicators, monthly
   standardized anomalies were estimated, which were used for both analyses
   of spatiotemporal patterns of drought and the relationship with yield
   anomalies. Anomalies in the ESI had higher correlations with maize and
   wheat yield anomalies than other indices, indicating that prolonged
   periods of low ESI during the growing season are highly correlated with
   reduced crop yields. All indices could identify past drought events,
   such as the drought in the USA in 2012, Eastern Africa in 2016-2017, and
   South Africa in 2015-2016. The results of this study highlight the
   potential of the use of moderate resolution remote sensing-based
   indicators combined with phenometrics for drought-induced crop impact
   monitoring. For several regions, droughts identified using the ESI and
   LST were more intense than the NDVI-based results. We showed that these
   indices are relevant for agricultural drought monitoring at both global
   and regional scales. They can be integrated into drought early warning
   systems, process-based crop models, as well as can be used for risk
   assessment and included in advanced decision-support frameworks.}},

   memory. A blind design of memory size can result in dramatic degradation
   in performance and power efficiency of the entire network. In this
   study, the authors clarify this impact and show how the optimum value of
   TCAM capacity is attainable. They also propose a power consumption model
   for TCAM-based OpenFlow switches. Simulation results show that the
   proposed solution reduces the average power consumption by 24\% compared
   to the minimum link on method and by 11.5\% compared to the minimum node
   on (MNO) method and thus power efficiency is better achieved when each
   memory is supplied by appropriate TCAM size.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies in social robotics show that it can provide economic
   efficiency and growth in domains such as retail, entertainment, and
   active and assisted living (AAL). Recent work also highlights that users
   have the expectation of affordable social robotics platforms, providing
   focused and specific assistance in a robust manner. In this paper, we
   present the AMIRO social robotics framework, designed in a modular and
   robust way for assistive care scenarios. The framework includes robotic
   services for navigation, person detection and recognition, multi-lingual
   natural language interaction and dialogue management, as well as
   activity recognition and general behavior composition. We present AMIRO
   platform independent implementation based on a Robot Operating System
   (ROS). We focus on quantitative evaluations of each functionality
   module, providing discussions on their performance in different settings
   and the possible improvements. We showcase the deployment of the AMIRO
   framework on a popular social robotics platform-the Pepper robot-and
   present the experience of developing a complex user interaction
   scenario, employing all available functionality modules within AMIRO.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. -The purpose of the present study was to investigate the
   effect of high glycemic HGI) and low glycemic (LGI) isoenergetic
   breakfast on glucose homeostasis and substrate oxidation during high
   intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE).
   Methods. -On two occasions, 7 days apart, eight healthy and practiced
   men with age (23.4 +/- 0.9 years) maximal oxygen uptake (53.7 +/- 1.0
   mL/kg/min) participated in this trial. At each stage, in 6 stages for
   measuring plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon.
   Results. -The results showed that in the postprandial period, plasma
   glucose and insulin concentrations in HGI were higher than LGI (P<
   0.05). In HGI, glucose concentration decreases rapidly in the early
   period of HIIE, but remains almost stable in LGI (P < 0.05). The area
   under the curve (AUG) of glucose and insulin in HGI are higher (1.08\%)
   than LGI (1.37\%), respectively. The oxidation of fat during exercise in
   LGI (2.5g) was higher than that of HGI (3g) (P < 0.05). Conversely,
   carbohydrate oxidation in HGI (63.4g) was higher than LGI (59.15g) (P <
   0.05).
   Conclusion. -HGI causes hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in the
   postprandial period, and higher levels of insulin before exercise can
   lead to a sudden drop in blood glucose over the course of the exercise,
   but LGI, due to lower insulinemia, helps to maintain better blood
   glucose and Glucose homeostasis during HIIE. LGI also increases fat
   oxidation, which can save carbohydrates. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{The construction of synthetic protein mimics is a central goal in
   chemistry. A known approach for achieving this goal is the self-assembly
   of synthetic biomimetic sequences into supramolecular structures.
   Obtaining different 3D structures via a simple sequence modification,
   however, is still challenging. Herein we present the design and
   synthesis of biomimetic architectures, via the self-assembly of distinct
   copper-peptoid duplexes. We demonstrate that changing only one
   non-coordinating side-chain within the peptoids-sequence-specific
   N-substituted glycine oligomers-leads to different supramolecular
   structures. Four peptoid trimers incorporating 2,2'-bipyridine and
   pyridine ligands, and a non-coordinating but rather a structure-directed
   bulky group were synthesized, and their solutions were treated with Cu2+
   in a 1:1 ratio. Single-crystal X-ray analysis of the products revealed
   the self-assembly of each peptoid into a metallopeptoid duplex, followed
   by the self-assembly of multiple duplexes and their packing into a
   three-dimensional supramolecular architecture via hydrogen bonding and
   pi-pi interactions. Tuning the non-coordinating side-chain enables to
   regulate both the final structure being either a tightly packed helical
   rod or a nano-channel, and the pore width of the nano-channels.
   Importantly, all the metallopeptoids structures are stable in aqueous
   solution as verified by cryo-TEM measurements and supported by UV/Vis
   and EPR spectroscopies and by ESI-MS analysis. Thus, we could also
   demonstrate the selective recognition abilities of the nano-channels
   towards glycerol.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness and precision of transporting wood chips on the
   transport trailer or hopper depends on an inclination angle, a conveyor
   belt speed, and length. In order to devise a methodology aiding
   designing and the selection of technical and performance parameters
   (aiding the settings of conveyor belt sub-assemblies), the authors
   carried out the simulation tests concerning wood chips transport on the
   belt conveyor and their outlet. For the purposes of these tests, a
   simulation model was performed in the Rocky DEM (discrete element
   method) software in the numerical analysis environment and compared to
   analytical tests. The tested wood chips were taken from cherry plum
   branches chipping processes (Prunus cerasifera Ehrh. Beitr. Naturk.
   4:17. 1789 (Gartenkalender 4:189-204. 1784)), out of which seven basic
   fractions were separated, which differed mainly in terms of their
   diameter from 5 mm to 50 mm and the length of 150 mm. The article
   presents the results of wood chips ejection distance in the form of the
   3D functions of wood chips ejection distance depending on the conveyor
   belt inclination angle and belt speed. The results are presented for
   five conveyor belt lengths (1 m, 2 m, 3 m, 4 m, 5 m). The tests also
   involved the conveyor belt inclination angle in the range from 10
   degrees to 50 degrees and the belt velocity in the range from 1 m/s(2)
   to 5 m/s(2). The numerical test results demonstrate higher average
   values of wood chips ejection distance than designated in the analytical
   model. The average arithmetical difference in the results between the
   numerical and analytical model is at the level of 13\%.}},

Abstract = {{Wakes behind turbomachine blades are generally highly turbulent and
   seemingly chaotic. Within the apparent chaos, coherent structures of
   various strength and length scales are present that are challenging to
   identify within individual snapshots of the wake flowfield. We propose a
   strategy to identify and separate multiscale vortices in the turbulent
   wake of a turbomachine blade from experimental data. Uncorrelated
   velocity field snapshots were obtained in the wake of a compressor blade
   in a linear cascade wind tunnel at Reynolds number=7x10(5) using
   particle image velocimetry. The snapshots were analyzed using proper
   orthogonal decomposition to identify the most energetic mode pairs
   representing vortex shedding patterns of different length scales with
   their own shedding frequency. The phase angles associated with the
   individual shedding patterns are extracted for each snapshot based on
   the time coefficients of the mode pairs. By averaging snapshots with the
   same phase angle for selected mode pairs, we were able to calculate
   mode- or scale-dependent phase average flowfields. These scale-dependent
   phase averages visually highlight the multiscale vortex character of the
   turbulent wake and allow for a quantitative analysis of the size,
   emerging location, and shedding frequency of the different structures.}},

   60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 degrees s(-1). Variables calculated during
   all leg extension muscle actions included peak torque (PT, Nm) and mean
   power (MP, W). Polynomial regression analyses determined the model of
   best fit for the PTand MP-velocity relationships. For each participant,
   the vertex from the PTand MP-velocity quadratic models were quantified
   as the predicted maximum velocity of last measurable torque (V-PT) and
   the predicted velocity of maximum mean power (V-MP), respectively.
   Measurements of growth, PT and MP at all velocities, V-PT, and V-MP were
   greater in the adolescents than children. When normalized to CSA, V-PT
   and V-MP remained greater for adolescents than children, and exhibited
   low to very high relationships with measurements of growth. When
   normalized to MVIC strength, V-PT and V-MP were no longer different
   between children and adolescents and exhibited negligible to low
   relationships with measurements of growth. The results of the present
   study suggest that the ability to produce torque and power at high
   velocities may be more dependent on muscle strength than muscle size,
   which suggests that mechanisms other than muscular hypertrophy affect
   torque and power production at high velocities in young males and
   females.}},

   electrocoagulation, electrochemical oxidation and adsorption processes:
   Optimization and toxicity assessment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{878}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, the sequential Electrocoagulation + Electro-oxidation +
   Activated carbon adsorption (EC + EO + AC) process was studied as an
   alternative for the treatment of an industrial textile wastewater (TWW)
   issuing from a manufacturing company located in Medellin (Colombia). The
   EC's and EO's operational conditions were optimized using a Box-Behnken
   experimental design, the Response Surface Methodology and a constrained
   nonlinear optimization algorithm in terms of organic matter degradation
   efficiency. The best performance for EC (i. e., dye removal = 94\%, COD
   and TOC degradation of 45 and 40\%, respectively) was obtained using Fe
   anode and Boron Doped Diamond (BDD) cathode, with current density, jEC,
   equals to 5 mA/cm(2), pH = 9.3, 60 RPM and 10 min of electrolysis. After
   EC treatment, the effluent biodegradability (evaluated as the BOD5/COD
   ratio) increases from 0.14 to 0.23. Regrettably, EC was not effective
   for the removal of acute toxicity to Artemia salina since the treated
   effluent remained very toxic (100\%). The treatment of EC's effluent by
   EO enhanced organic pollutant removal. For EC + EO sequential process,
   EO optimal operational conditions (j(Em) = 10 mA/cm(2), pH = 3, 240 RPM,
   BDD as anode and Fe as cathode) allowed reduction of 100\% of color,
   88\% of COD and 79\% of TOC after 30 min of electrolysis. Moreover, the
   BOD5/COD ratio increased from 0.23 to 0.58; however, the treated
   effluent remained very toxic to the Artemia salina. Consequently, an
   activated carbon adsorption step was included to complete the treatment
   process. Thus, by coupling the EC + EO + AC process, effluent's acute
   toxicity decreased completely. From molecular weight distribution
   analysis, it was concluded that EC + EO was efficient in eliminating low
   molecular weight (< 5 kDa) compounds. Finally, the operation cost, which
   includes chemical reagents, electrodes, energy consumption, and sludge
   disposal, for the EC + EO + AC sequential process was estimated in 3.83
   USD /m(3).}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the assessment of damages occurred to an
   Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) based composite during
   ballistic impacts with two bi-metallic projectiles of different
   morphologies and masses. More specifically, the evaluated composite is
   DYNEEMA (R) HB80. The conditions of impact aim at evaluating the behind
   armour blunt trauma effects (BABT) of blocks of ballistic gelatine
   covered by the composite protection. The evaluated cases correspond to
   non-perforating impacts of the composite. The microstructure of the
   intact composite is precisely described. The damaged plates are compared
   to evaluate the influence of the projectile nature and to verify the
   influence of their kinetic energy on the displacement, deformations and
   damage mechanisms of the composite plate. Post-mortem analyses of the
   composite with incrusted projectiles are performed. Also, because the
   dynamic interaction process between the projectiles and armour plates
   was not visible, numerical simulations were conducted with LS-DYNA (R).
   Overall, a good correlation was obtained between the tests and the
   models. An evaluation of the kinetic energy dissipation was also
   performed.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In image-to-image translation the goal is to learn a mapping from one
   image domain to another. In the case of supervised approaches the
   mapping is learned from paired samples. However, collecting large sets
   of image pairs is often either prohibitively expensive or not possible.
   As a result, in recent years more attention has been given to techniques
   that learn the mapping from unpaired sets.
   In our work, we show that injecting implicit pairs into unpaired sets
   strengthens the mapping between the two domains, improves the
   compatibility of their distributions, and leads to performance boosting
   of unsupervised techniques by up to 12\% across several measurements.
   The competence of the implicit pairs is further displayed with the use
   of pseudo-pairs, i.e., paired samples which only approximate a real
   pair. We demonstrate the effect of the approximated implicit samples on
   image-to-image translation problems, where such pseudo-pairs may be
   synthesized in one direction, but not in the other. We further show that
   pseudo-pairs are significantly more effective as implicit pairs in an
   unpaired setting, than directly using them explicitly in a paired
   setting. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The discussions around the unsustainability of the dominant
   socio-economic structures have yet to produce solutions to address the

   argues, are hindered by the limited scope of the proposed solutions

   technological rationale upon which these solutions are developed. In
   this paper, we conceptualize a radical sustainable alternative to the

   Internet as a potential system for energy production and consumption,

Abstract = {{During the last few years, the global demand for extra virgin olive oil
   (EVOO) is increased. Olive oil represents a significant percentage of
   world fat consumption determining an important development of its
   market. In this context, the problems related to counterfeiting and
   product fraud is becoming extremely relevant. Thus, the quality and
   authenticity control of EVOOs is nowadays mandatory. In this study we
   focused on the use of H-1 NMR technique associated with multivariate
   statistical analysis to characterize Italian EVOOs commercial blends. In
   particular, a specific database including 126 monocultivar EVOOs
   reference samples, was used to characterize a total of 241 Italian EVOOs
   blends over four consecutive harvesting years. Moreover, the effect of
   the minor components (phenolic compounds) on the qualitative
   characterization of blended EVOOs was also evaluated. The correlation
   analysis of classification scores obtained using two pairwise orthogonal
   partial least square-discriminant analysis models (built with major and
   combined major-minor components NMR data) revealed that both could be
   profitably used to generally classify the studied Coratina containing

Title = {{Heat transfer improvement by an Al2O3-water nanofluid coolant in
   printed-circuit heat exchangers of supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle}},

Abstract = {{The supercritical CO2 (SCO2) Brayton cycle is a technology proposed for
   the next generation power cycles, since it can attain high cycle
   efficiency. To this end, high cooling demands should be applied in these
   cycles. A modern technique to enhance heat transfer is the use of a
   mixture of nanoparticles with conventional base fluids in heat
   exchangers' channels. An analytical study of the thermal and hydraulic
   characteristics of a printed-circuit heat exchanger, employed as a
   precooler for SCO2 Brayton cycles by using an Al2O3-water nanofluid, is
   presented here. The precooler has a key role in overall performance and,
   thus, the optimal working fluid is of major importance. A segmental
   analysis pertaining to the heat exchanger takes place to evaluate the
   influence of nanofluid usage on the heat transfer coefficient, the
   exchanger's length and its pressure drop. The maximum nanoparticle
   volume fraction of 5\%, which was used in this investigation, resulted
   in an improvement of 10\% for the heat transfer coefficient as compared
   with the pure water working fluid. This improvement led to a 0.9\%
   reduction of the total heat exchanger length, while a decrease of the
   pressure drop up to 14\% was accomplished. These analytical calculations
   are anticipated to be very valuable given the growing progress in the
   field of nanofluids.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its recognized importance at the regulatory level, little
   attention has been paid to racial issues in the context of
   buyer-supplier relationships. To help address these limitations the
   current manuscript explores the impact of race in the supplier selection
   process. We used a scenario-based experiment approach across two studies
   conducted in the United States with 596 American buyer managers. Our
   findings indicate that the buyer's race and the supplier's race impact
   the buyer's decision of which supplier to select. Further, the race of
   the buyer's supervisor impacts the buyer's supplier selection decision.
   In addition, our findings show that the buyer's racial identity and
   racism also influence the buyer's perception of the severity of a
   supplier's service failure, and ultimately the buyer's level of
   satisfaction with the respective supplier.}},

Abstract = {{In many educational systems, students from families with low
   socioeconomic status (SES) often score lower academic achievement than
   their high SES peers. Even though this effect is well-documented and
   research teachers' stereotypical beliefs and attitudes is steadily
   increasing, the studies so far did not specifically focus students' SES.
   In the current study, we explored preservice teachers' implicit
   attitudes and their stereotypical prejudiced beliefs toward low SES
   students as well as their causal attributions for the low educational
   success low SES students. Results showed that teachers had negative
   implicit attitudes toward low SES students and they more strongly
   associated competences and good learning and working habits with high
   SES students. correlations highlighted the role that stereotypes play in
   causal attributions. Participants who more strongly associated low SES
   with competence and good working and learning behaviors were less likely
   to endorse ternal attributions but were more likely to emphasize
   external attributions. Hence, when preservice teachers low SES students
   as having high ability, they also strongly view the educational system
   as a source of the advantages that low SES students experience in
   school.}},

Title = {{Efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange in the treatment of penn class 3
   and 4 cytokine release syndrome complicating COVID-19}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{175}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially severe
   complication of COVID-19 most commonly resulting in respiratory failure.
   This ten-patient study was designed to determine the efficacy of
   therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in improving oxygenation and in
   reducing the cytokine load in a critically ill subset of patients.
   Methods: Five single volume plasma exchanges over eight days within a
   14-day study period. In mechanically ventilated patients, oxygenation
   was measured via the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio and the oxygenation index
   (OI) daily for 14 days. Supplemental oxygen requirements were tracked
   daily for non-ventilated patients.
   Results: Non-ventilated patients were liberated from supplemental oxygen
   after TPE. The response was rapid with an 87\% average reduction in
   oxygenation requirements following and average time to return to mom air
   of 5.25 days. All mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated
   improvement in oxygenation with a 78\% average improvement in the P/F
   ratio and a 43\% improvement in OI. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum
   levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF alpha, IFN gamma and GM-CSF, were
   measured daily with immediate post TPE levels drawn on days 1, 2, 4, 6
   and 8. All patients demonstrated significant reductions in CRP, IL-6,
   IL-10 and TNF alpha.
   Conclusions: In the majority of patients with Penn class 3 and 4 CRS
   complicating COVID-19, TPE demonstrated a prompt improvement in
   oxygenation and reduction in cytokine load without compromising patient
   safety. As this pilot study was envisioned to be hypothesis generating,
   expanded trials using TPE alone and in conjunction with novel
   pharmacologic agents are warranted.}},

Title = {{Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) 0ANLS Live-Attenuated Vaccine Protects
   against Ocular HSV-1 Infection in the Absence of Neutralizing Antibody
   in HSV-1 gB T Cell Receptor-Specific Transgenic Mice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of T cell and antibody responses following vaccination
   in resistance to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection continues to
   be rigorously investigated. In the present article, we explore the
   contribution of CD8(+) T cells specific for the major antigenic epitope
   for HSV-1 glycoprotein B (gB(498-505), gB) in C57BL/6 mice using a
   transgenic mouse (gBT-I.1) model vaccinated with HSV-1 0 Delta NLS.
   gBT-I.1-vaccinated mice did not generate a robust neutralization
   antibody titer in comparison to the HSV-1 0 Delta NLS-vaccinated
   wild-type C57BL/6 counterpart. Nevertheless, the vaccinated gBT-I.1 mice
   were resistant to ocular challenge with HSV-1 compared to
   vehicle-vaccinated animals based on survival and reduced corneal
   neovascularization but displayed similar levels of corneal opacity.
   Whereas there was no difference in the virus titer recovered from the
   cornea comparing vaccinated mice, HSV-1 0 Delta NLS-vaccinated animals
   possessed significantly less infectious virus during acute infection in
   the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and brain stem compared to the
   control-vaccinated group. These results correlated with a significant
   increase in gB-elicited interferon -gamma (IFN-gamma), granzyme B, and
   CD107a and a reduction in lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3),
   programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin
   domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3) expressed by TG infiltrating
   gB-specific CD8(+) T cells from the HSV-1 0 Delta NLS-vaccinated group.
   Antibody depletion of CD8(+) T cells in HSV-1 0 Delta NLS-vaccinated
   mice rendered animals highly susceptible to virus-mediated mortality
   similar to control-vaccinated mice. Collectively, the HSV-1 0 Delta NLS
   vaccine is effective against ocular HSV-1 challenge, reducing ocular
   neovascularization and suppressing peripheral nerve virus replication in
   the near absence of neutralizing antibody in this unique mouse model.
   IMPORTANCE The role of CD8(+) T cells in antiviral efficacy using a
   live-attenuated virus as the vaccine is complicated by the humoral
   immune response. In the case of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) 0.NLS
   vaccine, the correlate of protection has been defined to be primarily
   antibody driven. The current study shows that in the near absence of
   anti-HSV-1 antibody, vaccinated mice are protected from subsequent
   challenge with wild-type HSV-1 as measured by survival. The efficacy is
   lost following depletion of CD8(+) T cells. Whereas increased survival
   and reduction in virus replication were observed in vaccinated mice
   challenged with HSV-1, cornea pathology was mixed with a reduction in
   neovascularization but no change in opacity. Collectively, the study
   suggests CD8(+) T cells significantly contribute to the host adaptive
   immune response to HSV-1 challenge following vaccination with an
   attenuated virus, but multiple factors are involved in cornea pathology
   in response to ocular virus challenge.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aim: Although head and/or neck pain attributed to
   orthostatic hypotension is included in international guidelines, its
   mechanisms and relevance remain unknown. This study examined the term's
   relevance and aimed to elucidate the associated clinical features.
   Methods: An active stand test was performed to evaluate fluctuations in
   systemic and cerebral circulation in children and adolescents reporting
   complaints in the absence of a confirmed organic disorder. The subjects
   were categorized based on orthostatic headache presence/absence, and
   their characteristics and test results were compared. Results: Postural
   tachycardia syndrome was observed in 50.0\% of children with, and 55.1\%
   without, orthostatic headache. For orthostatic hypotension, the
   respective values were 31.3\% and 30.6\%. A history of migraine was more
   prevalent in children with orthostatic headaches (64.1\% vs. 28.6\%; p <
   0.01). The observed decrease in the cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin level
   was larger in children with orthostatic headaches (Left: 6.3 (3.2-9.4)
   vs. 4.1 (0.8-6.1); p < 0.01, Right: 5.3 (3.1-8.6) vs. 4.0 (0.8-5.9); p <
   0.01). Conclusion: Fluctuations in cerebral blood flow were associated
   with orthostatic headaches in children, suggesting that the headaches
   are due to impaired intracranial homeostasis. As orthostatic headache
   can have multiple causes, the term ``head and/or neck pain attributed to
   orthostatic (postural) hypotension{''} should be replaced with a more
   inclusive term.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to synthesize a gum
   ghatti-g-poly(acrylamide)/polypyrrole composite using a multistep
   aqueous polymerization method, in which the pyrrole monomer was absorbed
   into the network of the gum ghatti-acrylamide graft copolymer followed
   by the polymerization of the pyrrole monomers, and use it for the
   removal of Cr(VI) from water. The prepared was characterized using
   FT-IR, SEM, BET, XPS and XRD. The effects of the pH, adsorbent dose,
   contact time, concentration of Cr(VI), and temperature on the adsorption
   performance of the composite were investigated systematically. The
   adsorption of Cr(VI) on the composite depended strongly on the pH, and a
   Cr(VI) removal of 99.6\% was attained at pH 2.0, initial concentration
   of Cr (VI) of 100 mg/L, and adsorbent dosage of 0.035 g. The kinetics of
   the adsorption followed a pseudo-second ordermodel and the adsorption
   data fittedwell the Langmuir isothermmodel. The maximumadsorption
   capacity of the adsorbent at 298, 308, and 318 K was determined to be

Title = {{Effects of distance to the sea and geomorphological characteristics on

Abstract = {{Microplastics became an unprecedented challenge and mapping their
   contamination all over the world is needed in order to establish
   baseline levels and identify the polymers in order to enhance adequate
   legislation and policy. The main objective of this study is to
   demonstrate the existence of microplastic pollution on three beaches on
   the coast of Granada (Spain), namely La Herradura, Motril Beach and La
   Rabita, characterizing the particles and the relationships in their
   distribution. This may contribute supporting the studies carried out at
   a national level in accordance with the Directive on Marine Strategy
   (2008/56/EC). The results showed a greater median concentration of
   particles/kg of dry sediment in La Herradura (45.0 +/- 24.7) than in
   Motril (31.5 +/- 21.5) and La Rabita (22.0 +/- 23.2). These data
   revealed a higher contamination by microplastics in an enclosed bay-type
   beach (La Herradura) in comparison with open delta-type beaches. The
   predominant morphologies were microspheres and fragments, with maximum
   median concentrations of 38.0 +/- 23.7 and 6.0 +/- 0.7 particles/kg,
   respectively. The distribution and size of the particles is affected by
   the geomorphological and sedimentary characteristics of these beaches,
   which are different from any other in Spain and in the Mediterranean in
   general. The beaches of Granada showed more microplastic contamination
   than Greek or Slovenian beaches, but less than other Spanish beaches. In
   this area of the Mediterranean, the presence of microplastics can be
   affected by the wind, sea currents or methodological aspects such as the
   pore size of the filters used. All of these factors were analysed when
   comparing the beaches of Granada with other Mediterranean beaches. This
   study shows that there is contamination by microplastics on the beaches
   of Granada, which have been little explored until now due to the
   difficult geological and granulometric characteristics, and gives
   support to other national studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{After briefly outlining the vocabulary of closure and endings in Greek
   tragedy, this article analyses three possible features of closure: (1)
   lament (kommos), (2) deus ex machina combined with an aetiological myth
   (almost exclusively in Euripides), and (3) a gnomic coda spoken by the
   chorus. All three types of ending remain external to the plot and do not
   resolve the dramatic conflict. The paper then looks at two case studies
   from dramas centered on the same myth, i.e. the campaign of the Seven
   against Thebes in Aeschylus' play of the same name and in Euripides'
   Phoenissae. The endings of these tragedies have provoked much discussion
   regarding their textual transmission and reconstruction. I discuss how
   and when the action seems to be `fulfilled', and contrast the strong
   closure of Aeschylus' play with the ``hypertextual mythical
   continuity{''} (Lamari) of Euripides' drama.}},

Abstract = {{This work assesses the value of expendable bathythermograph (XBT) and
   Argo profiling float observations to monitor the Atlantic Ocean boundary
   current systems (BCS), meridional overturning circulation (MOC), and
   meridional heat transport (MHT). Data from six XBT transects and
   available Argo floats in the Atlantic Ocean for the period from 2000 to
   2018 are used to estimate the structure and variability of the BCS, MOC,
   and MHT, taking into account different temporal and spatial mapping
   strategies. `The comparison of Argo data density along these six XBT
   transects shows that Argo observations outnumber XBT observations only
   above mapping scales of 30 days and 3 degrees boxes. The comparison of
   Argo and XBT data for the Brazil Current and Gulf Stream shows that Argo
   cannot reproduce the structure and variability of these currents, as it
   lacks sufficient resolution to resolve the gradients across these narrow
   jets. For the MHT and MOC, Argo estimates are similar to those produced
   by XBTs at a coarse mapping resolution of 5 degrees and 30 days.
   However, at such a coarse resolution the root-mean-square errors
   calculated for both XBT and Argo estimates relative to a high-resolution
   baseline are higher than 3 Sv (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) and 0.25 PW for
   the MOC and MHT, respectively, accounting for about 25\%-30\% of their
   mean values due to the smoothing of eddy variability along the
   transects. A key result of this study is that using Argo and XBT data
   jointly, rather than separately, improves the estimates of MHT, MOC, and
   BCS.}},

Abstract = {{Neutral states have traditionally been seen as particularly well suited
   to function as international mediators. This assessment was based on the
   fact that both concepts - neutrality and mediation - have their roots in
   attempts to contain violent conflicts and thereby combine realist and
   idealistic dimensions of international relations. While due to these
   normative commonalities, the increased influence of norms in mediation
   might be deemed to favour the role of neutral states as mediators, a
   more nuanced analysis reveals a mixed impact: The new norms made
   mediation enter into policy fields to which neutrality does not apply.
   But they also increased the complexities of mediation processes which in
   turn could open up new opportunities for neutral states.}},

   Supply Chain of Biomass Co-Firing}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Coal is the second-largest source for electricity generation in the
   United States. However, the burning of coal produces dangerous gas
   emissions, such as carbon dioxide and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions.
   One alternative to decrease these emissions is biomass co-firing. To
   establish biomass as a viable option, the optimization of the biomass
   supply chain (BSC) is essential. Although most of the research conducted
   has focused on optimization models, the purpose of this paper is to
   incorporate machine-learning (ML) algorithms into a stochastic
   Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to select potential
   storage depot locations and improve the solution in two ways: by
   decreasing the total cost of the BSC and the computational burden. We
   consider the level of moisture and level of ash in the biomass from each
   parcel location, the average expected biomass yield, and the distance
   from each parcel to the closest power plant. The training labels
   (whether a potential depot location is beneficial or not) are obtained
   through the stochastic MILP model. Multiple ML algorithms are applied to
   a case study in the northeast area of the United States: Logistic
   Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer
   Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network. After applying the hybrid methodology
   combining ML and optimization, it is found that the MLP outperforms the
   other algorithms in terms of selecting potential depots that decrease
   the total cost of the BSC and the computational burden of the stochastic
   MILP model. The LR and the DT also perform well in terms of decreasing
   total cost.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The impact on clinical practice of the international
   guidelines including the Sendai Guidelines (SG06) and Fukuoka Guidelines
   (FG12) on the management of cystic lesions of the pancreas (CLP) has not
   been well-studied. The primary aim was to examine the changing trends
   and outcomes in the surgical management of CLP in our institution over
   time and to determine the impact of these guidelines on our institution
   practice.
   Methods: 462 patients with surgically-treated CLP were retrospectively
   reviewed and classified under the 2 guidelines. The cohort was divided
   into 3 time periods: 1998-2006, 2007-2012 and 2013 to 2018.
   Results: Comparison across the 3 time periods demonstrated significantly
   increasing frequency of older patients, asymptomatic CLP, male gender,
   smaller tumor size, elevated Ca 19-9, use of magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) and use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) prior to surgery. There was
   also significantly increasing frequency of adherence to the
   international guidelines as evidenced by the increasing proportion of
   HRSG06 and HRFG12 CLP with a corresponding lower proportion of LRSG06
   and LRFG12 being resected. This resulted in a significantly higher
   proportion of resected CLP whereby the final pathology confirmed that a
   surgery was actually indicated.
   Conclusions: Over time, there was increasing adherence to the
   international guidelines for the selection of patients for surgical
   resection as evidenced by the significantly increasing proportion of
   HRSG06 and HRFG06 CLPs undergoing surgery. This was associated with a
   significantly higher proportion of patients with a definitive indication
   for surgery.
   These suggested that over time, there was a continuous improvement in
   our selection of appropriate CLP for surgical treatment. (C) 2020 IAP

Abstract = {{Ependymomas are tumors located in the central nervous system, mostly in
   the brain and spinal cord. This tumor is rarely seen as a primary
   mediastinal location. The aim of this study is to discuss this rare
   pathology in the clinical course of an unusual case. A 47-year-old
   female patient was referred to our clinic with the complaint of back and
   shoulder pain, via VATS posterior mediastinum located paravertebral mass
   excision was performed. The pathology reported as ependymoma. Two years
   later, CT scans of the routine control showed the well-defined mass in
   anterior mediastinum. The SUVmax of the lesion was measured as 9.3 at
   PET-CT. The lesion in the anterior mediastinum was excised by partial
   sternotomy. The pathology result was the same as the prior operation:
   Ependymoma. As our case, in these kinds of tumors meticulous follow-up
   of the patients is important for the detection and treatment of
   recurrent localization and distant metastases.}},

Title = {{Contribution of sarcopenia and physical inactivity to mortality in
   people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease}},
Journal = {{JHEP REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle have
   contributed to the epidemic of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver
   disease (NAFLD). We assessed the association between physical activity,
   NAFLD, and sarcopenia, and their contributions to mortality.
   Methods: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
   (NHANES) 1999-2004 with Linked Mortality file (through 2015) was
   utilised. NAFLD was determined by the US Fatty Liver Index in the
   absence of secondary causes of liver disease. Sarcopenia was defined
   using appendicular lean mass divided by body mass index by the
   Foundation for the National Institutes of Health criteria. Activity
   level was determined using standard self-reports. Publicly available
   imputed dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry data sets were used.
   Results: Of 4,611 NHANES participants (48.2\% males; 72.5\% White; mean
   age 45.9 years), NAFLD was present in 1,351 (29.3\%), of whom 17.7\% had
   sarcopenia. Of the NAFLD group, 46.3\% was inactive, whilst intermediate
   and ideal physical activity rates were observed in 14.2\% and 39.5\%,
   respectively. Sarcopenia was significantly and inversely related to
   higher physical activity level, both amongst NAFLD (odds ratio {[}OR] =
   0.45 {[}95\% CI 0.30-0.69]) and non-NAFLD (OR = 0.51 {[}0.35-0.75])
   groups. During a median follow-up of 13.5 years, a total of 586 subjects
   died, of whom 251 had NAFLD. Amongst those who died with NAFLD, 33.0\%
   had sarcopenia and 54.3\% were inactive. Compared with NAFLD without
   sarcopenia, NAFLD with sarcopenia was associated with a higher risk of
   all-cause (hazard ratio {[}HR] = 1.78 {[}1.16-2.73]), cardiac-specific
   (HR = 3.19 {[}1.17-8.74]), and cancer-specific mortality (HR = 2.12
   {[}1.08-4.15]).
   Conclusions: Inactivity is associated with presence of sarcopenia,
   whilst sarcopenia is associated with increased mortality amongst NAFLD
   patients. Sarcopenia should be a part of clinical assessment of patients
   with NAFLD. Treatment of NAFLD should include optimal management of
   sarcopenia. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf

Abstract = {{PURPOSEThe irreversible ErbB family tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
   afatinib plus the EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab was previously
   shown to overcome resistance to EGFR TKIs. We studied whether the
   combination of afatinib plus cetuximab compared with afatinib alone
   would improve progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with
   treatment-naive EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by
   preventing or delaying resistance.METHODSPatients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC
   without prior treatment of advanced disease were enrolled in this phase
   II, multicenter trial and randomly assigned to receive afatinib 40 mg
   orally daily plus cetuximab 500 mg/m(2) intravenously every 2 weeks or
   afatinib alone. The primary end point was PFS.RESULTSBetween March 25,
   2015 and April 23, 2018, 174 patients were randomly assigned, and 168
   (83 on afatinib + cetuximab and 85 on afatinib) were eligible. There was
   no improvement in PFS in patients receiving afatinib plus cetuximab
   compared with afatinib alone (hazard ratio {[}HR], 1.01; 95\% CI, 0.72
   to 1.43; P = .94; median, 11.9 months v 13.4 months). Similarly, there
   was no difference in response rate (67\% v 74\%; P = .38) or overall
   survival (HR, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.50 to 1.36; P = .44). Toxicity was
   greater with the combination: grade >= 3 adverse events related to
   treatment occurred in 72\% of patients receiving afatinib plus cetuximab
   compared with 40\% of those receiving afatinib alone, most commonly rash
   and diarrhea. Dose reductions were more common in patients receiving the
   combination, and 30\% of patients in this arm discontinued cetuximab due
   to toxicity. At interim analysis, there was insufficient evidence to
   support continued accrual, and the trial was closed.CONCLUSIONSThe
   addition of cetuximab to afatinib did not improve outcomes in previously
   untreated EGFR-mutant NSCLC, despite recognized activity in the acquired
   resistance setting.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic congestion is caused due to an imbalance of transportation
   demand and supply. Traffic congestion is not only responsible for
   harming our health but also for not gaining full potential in our
   economic sector. Traffic congestion is an obstacle to the development of
   any country as it creates a huge amount of economic costs, discomfort
   cost, and alike. In the current scenario Indore city also prevails such
   a condition, some intersections of the city are badly affected by
   traffic congestion which causes potential hazard and delays so traffic
   congestion study is much needed at some potential road intersections.
   Several parameters like segmental delay, delay ratio, and relative delay
   ratio have been used to effectively measure traffic congestion at some
   potential sections taken for 6 locations. A model developed for
   segmental delay (Vehicle-second), segmental delay (person-second), delay

Abstract = {{Brand anthropomorphism is recognised as an important construct in
   marketing, yet it lacks clarity in operationalisation and valid
   measurement. The objective of this research, therefore, is to develop
   and validate the brand anthropomorphism scale (BASC). Brand
   anthropomorphism is defined as the perception of brand as an entity that
   has analogical human-like features, mental and emotional states that
   people believe to be distinctively human. It is conceptualised as a
   multidimensional superordinate construct. Across six studies (N = 1666),
   this research develops a valid and reliable measure of brand
   anthropomorphism that has psychometric properties for convergent,
   discriminant and predictive validity. The results indicate that brand
   anthropomorphism is a valid predictor of outcomes such as brand trust
   and brand commitment. Finally, in support of incremental validity, it is
   identified that the BASC explains variance in brand trust and brand
   commitment above and beyond the measure of brand anthropomorphism
   commonly employed in the literature. Theoretical implications for
   research and implications for practice are also discussed. (C) 2020

   power series-based method is employed to approximate the optimal

Abstract = {{Knowledge of carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios in organic matter and
   their changes is important when studying nutrient cycles in aquatic
   ecosystems. Relationships between delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of
   suspended particulate organic matter (POM), water temperature, salinity,
   pH, redox potential, chlorophyll a concentration, primary production,
   and biomasses of different taxonomic groups of phytoplankton in the Neva
   Estuary were statistically analyzed. We tested the hypothesis that the
   studied physicochemical and biogeochemical characteristics, as well as
   the species composition of phytoplankton and its productivity, can be
   significant predictors of changes in the isotopic ratios of suspended
   particulate organic matter in estuaries. In the Neva Estuary, delta
   C-13(POM) (-16.8--27.6 parts per thousand) and delta N-15(POM) (2.3-7.3
   parts per thousand) changed synchronously. Statistical analysis showed
   that for both isotopes, the photosynthetic activity and taxonomic
   composition of phytoplankton are important. For C-13(POM), the second
   most important factor was water salinity, which was apparently

Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{This study examined patterns of tobacco product use and their
   association with nicotine dependence among U.S. youth. Combined data
   from the 2017-2018 National Youth Tobacco Surveys were analyzed for
   students that reported current (past-30-day) use of e-cigarettes,
   cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, or hookah (n = 6106). Analyses
   assessed multiple product use (>2 tobacco products) overall and by sex,
   school level, race/ethnicity, current use, and frequent use (use of a
   product for >20 of the preceding 30 days). Multivariable logistic
   regression was used to identify correlates of nicotine dependence.
   During 2017-2018, 40.8\% of tobacco product users reported use of
   multiple products. Multiple product use ranged from 47.0\% among
   e-cigarette users to 80.7\% among cigarette smokers. Among frequent
   users of each respective product, 80.0\% of cigarette smokers, 74.9\% of
   cigar smokers, 73.6\% of smokeless tobacco users, 70.7\% of hookah
   smokers, and 40.3\% of e-cigarette users reported use of multiple
   products. Most youth who reported nicotine dependence (64.0\%) were
   multiple product users. E-cigarettes were the most common single product
   used (36.3\%) and the product most commonly used in combination with
   other products; e-cigarettes plus cigarettes (6.7\%) was the most common
   product combination. Combustible product use, smokeless tobacco use,
   multiple product use and frequent use were associated with greater odds
   of nicotine dependence. Nicotine dependence among youth is especially
   influenced by cigarette use, smokeless tobacco use, frequent use of any
   tobacco product, and multiple product use. Proven tobacco control
   interventions in coordination with regulatory efforts can reduce youth
   tobacco product use.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of bone densitometry by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry as a

Journal = {{BONE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The 2017 KDIGO guidelines establish a 2B grade
   recommendation in favor of testing Bone Mineral Density (BMD) by DXA to
   assess osteoporotic fracture (OPF) risk in patients with CKD G3a-G5D.
   Still, controversy remains because large studies evaluating it for this
   particular population are lacking.
   Aim: To establish the clinical performance of BMD measured by DXA in the
   evaluation of fracture risk in women with CKD.
   Methods: We conducted a 43 year retrospective cohort study with 218
   women >= 18 years-old with CKD and BMD measurement by DXA of total hip
   and lumbar spine. Clinical (age, year of CKD onset, comorbidities, BMI,
   transplant status, treatment), and biochemical (PTH, corrected calcium,
   phosphate, vitamin D {[}25 (OH) D3], creatinine, and albumin),
   parameters were collected from hospital records. All osteoporotic
   fractures (as defined by the WHO) found in the clinical and radiologic
   files were registered.
   Results: 218 women with a median age of 60 years (40-73 IQ range) and a
   CKD evolution time of 12 years (7-18 IQ range) were evaluated.
   Forty-eight (28.23\%) presented an OPF. These women were older (57 vs 69
   years, p =0.0072) and had a lower BMD. CKD stage did not influence
   fracture incidence. In the multivariate analysis we found that for each
   standard deviation decrease in hip and lumbar spine T-Score, the overall
   fracture risk was 2.7 and 2.04 times higher, respectively. More than
   50\% of fractures took place within the first ten years of follow-up,
   especially with GFR <30 mL/min/m(2) and osteoporosis. Diabetes and
   hypothyroidism accelerated fracture onset, while renal transplant
   delayed it. In the ROC analysis, the AUC was largest with the total hip
   (0.7098, p = 0.000) and lumbar spine (0.6916, p = 0.000).
   Conclusions: BMD measured by DXA is a useful fracture prediction tool
   for women with CKD, having a sensibility and specificity similar to that
   in the general population. It seems to be appropriate for the diagnosis,
   treatment decisions, and follow-up of patients with renal failure.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The analysis of particular (electroencephalographic) EEG
   frequency bands has revealed new insights relative to the neural
   dynamics that, when studying the EEG spectrum as a whole, would have
   remained hidden. This study is aimed at characterizing spectral resting
   state EEG patterns for assessing possible differences of episodic and
   chronic migraine during the interictal period. For that purpose, a novel
   methodology for analyzing specific frequencies of interest was
   performed. Methods. Eighty-seven patients with migraine (45 with
   episodic and 42 with chronic migraine) and 39 age- and sex-matched
   controls performed a resting-state EEG recording. Spectral measures were
   computed using conventional frequency bands. Additionally, particular
   frequency bands were determined to distinguish between controls and
   migraine patients, as well as between migraine subgroups. Results.
   Frequencies ranging from 11.6 Hz to 12.8 Hz characterized migraine as a
   whole, with differences evident in the central and left parietal regions
   (controlling for false discovery rate). An additional band between 24.1
   Hz and 29.8 Hz was used to discriminate between migraine subgroups.
   Interestingly, the power in this band was positively correlated with
   time from onset in episodic migraine, but no correlation was found for
   chronic migraine. Conclusions. Specific frequency bands were proposed to
   identify the spectral characteristics of the electrical brain activity
   in migraine during the interictal stage. Our findings support the
   importance of discriminating between migraine subgroups to avoid hiding
   relevant features in migraine.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present work was to study the influence of the addition
   of two types of inorganic fillers, silica (SiO2) and muscovite mica, to
   obtain composites with post-industrial plastic wood residues. Mica is a
   natural product, derived from mining, and silica is obtained by a
   chemical synthesis route (Pechini Method). The composite materials were
   obtained in double screw extruder, pressed to obtain films and later
   characterized by density analysis, Shore D hardness, melt flow index
   (MFI) and optical microscopy. The results indicate that the addition of
   up to 10 \% of muscovite did not modify the properties of the polymeric
   matrix; however, the addition of 10 \% silica caused a reduction in
   density, hardness and MFI values, which may be related to poor
   polymer-filler interaction. From the FTIR spectra, it can be inferred
   that there is no chemical interaction between the matrix and the fillers
   used.}},

Abstract = {{Brazilian freshwater ecosystems are continuously exposed to pesticides
   and domestic sewage. The Uruguay River was chosen for this study because
   of its international importance, as it flows through Brazil, Argentina,
   and Uruguay. It receives contaminants such as pesticides and domestic
   residues. Thus, the aim of this study to assess the accumulation of
   pesticides in muscle of the fish Astyanax jacuhiensis, its biochemical
   responses, and the presence of pesticides in water. In total, seven
   pesticides were registered in water from both river sites. Eight
   pesticides were detected in fish muscle. The biochemical responses
   showed that brain lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonyl (PC) in
   A. jacuhiensis were higher in the summer. Muscle showed the highest LPO
   levels in the spring and the highest PC in the summer. Liver LPO and PC
   levels were higher in the spring and summer. In the gills, the PC was
   higher in the spring and the LPO in the spring and winter. In the brain
   and in the gills, glutathione-S-transferase activity was high in the
   summer and autumn. Catalase activity was lower during the winter and
   spring. Non-protein thiol (NPSH) levels were lower in the brain in the
   winter and spring. Muscle tissue showed lower NPSH in the winter (site
   1). Liver NPSH showed increased levels in liver in the spring and winter
   (site 2). The biochemical results clearly is related to pesticides
   and/or to the presence of other contaminants in the water such as metals
   or domestic sewage. The accumulation of pesticides in fish muscle added
   evidence that pesticides have been used in the area surrounding the
   Uruguay River. In conclusion, the bio-markers assayed in the present
   study could be used in future investigations considering other sampling
   sites along Uruguay River.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{225}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This article presents and validates a dynamic model of a natural gas-run
   micro-CHP boiler, whose primary mover is a Stirling engine. From a
   preliminary literature review on the modelling of this kind of devices,
   and taking into consideration the goal of performing full system
   simulations, a semi-empirical one is proposed. Specifically, the model
   consists of the direct application of general mass and energy
   conservation principles, supported by empirical expressions based on
   parametric factors that must be determined experimentally. For that
   purpose, an experimental test-rig was developed, and a full
   characterization of a Stirling unit was carried out in order to
   calibrate the model. Unlike other previous models, the one developed
   throughout this article fully takes into account both the dynamics that
   occur during the start-up and cool-down periods, as well as the partial
   load performance of the engine, providing high precision results while
   maintaining the simplicity required in energy simulation environments.
   Calculations during the validation phase show that, when operating at
   normal conditions, the model is able to reproduce the electricity output
   and the water delivery temperature with errors below 2.4\% and 0.9\% in
   any case, respectively; while during a full-length test, the mean errors
   for the energy exchanges due to fuel input, thermal output and
   electrical output were 1.4\%, 0.4\% and 0.1\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Swimming training programs may help to limit declines in cardiovascular
   conditioning, muscle strength, mobility and social functioning in
   individuals with Down's Syndrome (DS): (1) Background: This study aims
   to analyze the effects of a periodized swimming training program on
   swimming speed, lower body force and power and body composition in a
   group of swimmers with DS; (2) Methods: Nine swimmers with DS (2 men and
   7 women; aged 21-30 years-old) completed an 18-week periodized swimming
   program. The swimmers were assessed, pre and post-training, for 25 m, 50
   m and 100 m freestyle swim performance, countermovement jump performance
   and body composition; (3) Results: Significant and large improvements in
   25 m (mean -6.39\%, p < 0.05, d = 1.51), 50 m (mean -4.95\%, p < 0.01, d
   = 2.08) and 100 m (mean -3.08\%, p < 0.05, d = 1.44) freestyle
   performance were observed following training, with no significant
   changes in body composition or consistent changes in jump performance
   (although a large mean 14.6\% decrease in relative peak force, p < 0.05,
   d = 1.23) (4) Conclusions: A periodized 18-week training intervention
   may improve swimming performance in a small group of trained swimmers
   with DS, with less clear changes in jump performance or body
   composition. This program provides a training profile for coaches
   working with swimmers with DS and a platform for further research into
   the benefits of swimming training with this under-represented
   population.}},

Journal = {{VACCINES}},

Abstract = {{COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, contributes
   significantly to the morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. In the
   absence of specific vaccines or therapeutics available, COVID-19 cases
   are managed empirically with the passive immunity approach and
   repurposing of drugs used for other conditions. Recently, a concept that
   bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination could confer protection
   against COVID-19 has emerged. The foundation for this widespread
   attention came from several recent articles, including the one by Miller
   et al. submitted to MedRxiv, a pre-print server. The authors of this
   article suggest that a correlation exists between countries with a
   prolonged national BCG vaccination program and the morbidity/mortality
   due to COVID-19. Further, clinical BCG vaccination trials are currently
   ongoing in the Netherlands, Australia, the UK, and Germany with the hope
   of reducing mortality due to COVID-19. Although BCG vaccination helps
   protect children against tuberculosis, experimental studies have shown
   that BCG can also elicit a non-specific immune response against viral
   and non-mycobacterial infections. Here, we summarize the pros and cons
   of BCG vaccination and critically analyze the evidence provided for the
   protective effect of BCG against COVID-19 and highlight the confounding
   factors in these studies.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{621-641}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Trajectories in human aimed movements are inherently variable. Using the
   concept of positional variance profiles, such trajectories are shown to
   be decomposable into two phases: In a first phase, the variance of the
   limb position over many trajectories increases rapidly; in a second
   phase, it then decreases steadily. A new theoretical model, where the
   aiming task is seen as a Shannon-like communication problem, is
   developed to describe the second phase: Information is transmitted from
   a ``source{''} (determined by the position at the end of the first
   phase) to a ``destination{''} (the movement's end-point) over a
   ``channel{''} perturbed by Gaussian noise, with the presence of a
   noiseless feedback link. Information-theoretic considerations show that
   the positional variance decreases exponentially with a rate equal to the
   channel capacity C. Two existing datasets for simple pointing tasks are
   re-analyzed and observations on real data confirm our model. The first
   phase has constant duration, and C is found constant across instructions
   and task parameters, which thus characterizes the participant's
   performance. Our model provides a clear understanding of the
   speed-accuracy tradeoff in aimed movements: Since the participant's
   capacity is fixed, a higher prescribed accuracy necessarily requires a
   longer second phase resulting in an increased overall movement time. The
   well-known Fitts' law is also recovered using this approach.}},

   approximate solutions of systems of partial differential evolution
   equations (PDE). The basis of this method is the concept of
   finite-dimensional dynamics, introduced for scalar equations by B.
   Kruglikov, O. Lychagina and V. Lychagin. The basic idea is that a system
   of evolution equations generates a flow in the space of solutions of
   some systems of ordinary differential equations. These ordinary
   differential equations have symmetries whose generating functions are
   generated by the right-hand sides of the evolutionary system. Dynamics
   and exact solutions for a system of evolution equations that describes
   processes of deep filtration of a suspension and the telegraph equation
   are constructed.}},

Abstract = {{The fungicide carbendazim (CBM) has been applied all around the world
   but its potential adverse effects other than its recognized activity as
   endocrine disruptor in non target organisms have been scarcely studied.
   The aims of this work were (1) to use a battery of biomarkers that can
   reflect potential negative effects such as oxidative stress,
   genotoxicity, neurotoxicity or altered immune response; and (2) to
   examine biomarkers of detoxification by analyzing the gene expression of
   cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) and the multi-xenobiotic resistance protein
   P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the freshwater fish Jenynsia multidentata
   exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of CBM during 24 h.
   Fish exposed to 5 mu g/L showed inhibition of GST activity and an
   increase of TBARs contents in gills, the organ of direct contact with
   waterborne contaminants. Genotoxicity - measured in peripheral blood-was
   evidenced by the increases of micronuclei frequency when fish were
   exposed to 5, 10 and 100 mu g/L CBM and of nuclear abnormalities (NA)
   frequency at 0.05, 0.5, 5, 10 and 100 mu g/L CBM. The expression
   inhibition of interleukin (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor a
   (TNF-alpha) at 10, and 5 and 10 mu g/L CBM, respectively, indicated an
   altered immune response. The expression of CYP1A1 was down regulated in
   liver at 10 mu g/L and of P-gp at 5 mu g/L CBM, indicating a possible
   slow on CBM metabolization. On the other hand, in gills CYP1A1 decreased
   at 5 and 10 mu g/L while P-gp was induced at 5 and 100 mu g/L CBM.
   Overall, most of these significant effects were detected below 10 mu g/L
   CBM, in a range of realistic concentrations in aquatic ecosystems
   worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{This study is set on the background of a randomized control trial (RCT)
   in which intervention was carried to observe the effects of yoga/light
   exercise on the improvement in health and well-being among the elderly
   population. A longitudinal qualitative study was conducted as part of
   RCT interventions to explore the experience of the elderly practicing
   yoga/light exercise in relation to sedentary behavior in the Ujjain
   district of Madhya Pradesh, India. Participants of the RCT were selected
   for this study. Eighteen focus group discussions were conducted-six
   during each phase of RCT interventions (before, during, and after). The
   findings regarding motivating and demotivating factors in various phases
   of intervention were presented in three categories: experience and
   perception of the effects of yoga/light exercise on sedentary behavior
   (1) before, (2) during, and (3) after intervention. This study explores
   the positive effect of yoga/light exercise on sedentary behavior and
   subjective well-being on the elderly population. They were recognized to
   have undergone changes in their physical and emotional well-being by
   consistently practicing yoga/light exercise. The main driving factors
   were periodic health check-ups and the encouragement of qualified
   trainers without any cost. This study concludes with the notion that
   these interventions should be encouraged in the community to use
   physical exercise as a method to better control the physical and social
   effects of aging.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In the present work an attempt was made to determine the most
   influencing factor through numerical optimization and also to develop a
   statistical model for the NOx and smoke control of a DI CI engine with
   less compromise on engine performance. Seven numeric factors (retarded
   injection timing, injection pressure, percentage of exhaust gas
   recirculation, percentage of biodiesel, Butanol, Proponol and Pentanol)
   and one categorical factor (piston geometry) were selected as the
   factors for the investigation. Experiments were designed through Taguchi
   orthogonal array and a single cylinder stationary engine was chosen for
   conducing the experiments. Results of the experiments were fed into the
   input for the statistical analysis. NOx, smoke and brake specific fuel
   consumption (BSFC) were chosen as the responses for the present work.
   Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Half Normal plot methods were performed
   to investigate the factor effects on the chosen responses. A coded
   regression equation was also developed to predict the responses. From
   the analysis, it was observed that piston geometry and percentage of
   biodiesel in the blend have major effect when compared with the other
   factors tested in this work. Numerical optimization and Fit statistical
   results were compared with experimental results and toroidal piston
   geometry at 20 percentage of biodiesel in the blend were found as the
   best combination of factor levels for this work.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Orbital floor fractures occur commonly as a result of
   blunt trauma to the face and periorbital region. Orbital floor fractures
   with a ``trapdoor{''} component allow both herniation and incarceration
   of contents through a bone defect into the maxillary sinus as the bone
   rebounds faster than the soft tissue, trapping muscle, fat, and fascia
   in the fracture site. In children, the fractured floor, which is often
   hinged on one side, tends to return toward its original anatomical
   position due to the incomplete nature of the fracture and elasticity of
   the bone. The entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle itself is
   considered a true surgical emergency-prolonged entrapment frequently
   leads to muscle ischemia and necrosis leading to permanent limitation of
   extraocular motility and difficult to correct diplopia. For this reason,
   prompt surgical intervention is recommended by most surgeons. In adults,
   true entrapment of the muscle itself is not as common because the
   orbital floor is not as elastic and fractures are more complete.
   Methods: We present an adult patient with an isolated orbital floor
   fracture with clinical and radiologic evidence of true entrapment of the
   inferior rectus muscle itself.
   Results: Despite the delayed surgical repair (4 days after the injury),
   the patient's inferior rectus muscle function returned to near normal
   with mild upward gaze diplopia.
   Conclusions: Inferior rectus entrapment in adults may more likely be
   associated with immobilization of the muscle without total vascular
   compression/incarceration significant enough to lead to complete
   ischemic necrosis.}},

Title = {{Comparing Precision Machine Learning With Consumer, Quality, and Volume
   Metrics for Ranking Orthopedic Surgery Hospitals: Retrospective Study}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients' choices of providers when undergoing elective
   surgeries significantly impact both perioperative outcomes and costs.
   There exist a variety of approaches that are available to patients for
   evaluating between different hospital choices.
   Objective: This paper aims to compare differences in outcomes and costs
   between hospitals ranked using popular internet-based consumer ratings,
   quality stars, reputation rankings, average volumes, average outcomes,
   and precision machine learning-based rankings for hospital settings
   performing hip replacements in a large metropolitan area.
   Methods: Retrospective data from 4192 hip replacement surgeries among
   Medicare beneficiaries in 2018 in a the Chicago metropolitan area were
   analyzed for variations in outcomes (90-day postprocedure
   hospitalizations and emergency department visits) and costs (90-day
   total cost of care) between hospitals ranked through multiple
   approaches: internet-based consumer ratings, quality stars, reputation
   rankings, average yearly surgical volume, average outcome rates, and
   machine learning-based rankings. The average rates of outcomes and costs
   were compared between the patients who underwent surgery at a hospital
   using each ranking approach in unadjusted and propensity-based adjusted
   comparisons.
   Results: Only a minority of patients (1159/4192, 27.6\% to 2078/4192,
   49.6\%) were found to be matched to higher-ranked hospitals for each of
   the different approaches. Of the approaches considered, hip replacements
   at hospitals that were more highly ranked by consumer ratings, quality
   stars, and machine learning were all consistently associated with
   improvements in outcomes and costs in both adjusted and unadjusted
   analyses. The improvement was greatest across all metrics and analyses
   for machine learning-based rankings.
   Conclusions: There may be a substantive opportunity to increase the
   number of patients matched to appropriate hospitals across a broad
   variety of ranking approaches. Elective hip replacement surgeries
   performed at hospitals where patients were matched based on
   patient-specific machine learning were associated with better outcomes
   and lower total costs of care.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a survey on selected models of opinion dynamics. Both
   discrete (more precisely, binary) opinion models as well as continuous

   paid to modeling nonconformity (in particular, anticonformity) behavior.
   For the case of opinions represented by a binary variable, we recall the
   threshold model, the voter and q-voter models, the majority rule model,
   and the aggregation framework. For the case of continuous opinions, we
   present the DeGroot model and some of its variations, time-varying
   models, and bounded confidence models.}},

Title = {{Immediate Effects of Aquatic Therapy on Balance in Older Adults with
   Upper Limb Dysfunction: An Exploratory Study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Aquatic physiotherapy has been shown to be effective in
   developing balance, strength, and functional reach over time. When
   dealing with immediate effects, the literature has concentrated more on
   the body's physiological response to the physical and mechanical
   properties of water during passive immersion. The purpose of this study
   was to evaluate the effects of a single 45-min active aquatic
   physiotherapy session on standing balance and strength, and its
   relationship with functional reach in persons 55 years and older with
   upper limb dysfunction. Methods: The intervention group (n = 12) was
   assessed before and after a single aquatic physiotherapy session, while
   the control group (n = 10) was evaluated before and after 45 min of
   sitting rest. Functional assessment was made using the visual analogue
   pain scale (points), step test (repetitions), functional reach test
   (cm), and global balance-standing test on a force platform (\% time). A
   two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was applied (p < 0.05). Results: The
   intervention group showed non-significant improvements between
   measurement before and after the intervention: Pain: 6.2 +/- 1.9 vs. 5.2
   +/- 2.3 cm, steps: 7.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 7.4 +/- 1.8 repetitions, reach: 9.1
   +/- 2.8 vs. 10.4 +/- 3.8 cm, and balance: 61.7 +/- 5.9 vs. 71.3 +/-
   18.2\% time in balance on the platform. The control group showed fewer
   changes but had better baseline values. A comparison between groups with
   time showed no significant differences in these changes. Conclusions: No
   significant immediate effects were found for one session of aquatic
   physiotherapy applied to patients older than 55 years with upper limb
   dysfunction.}},

   Methodological Puzzle}},
Journal = {{BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Facing current biomimetics impediments, recent studies have supported
   the integration within biomimetic teams of a new actor having biological
   knowledge and know-how. This actor is referred to as the
   ``biomimetician{''} in this article. However, whereas biology is often
   considered a homogenous whole in the methodological literature targeting
   biomimetics, it actually gathers fundamentally different fields. Each of
   these fields is structured around specific practices, tools, and
   reasoning. Based on this observation, we wondered which knowledge and
   know-how, and so biological fields, should characterize biomimeticians.
   Following the design research methodology, this article thus
   investigates the operational integration of two biological fields,
   namely ecology and phylogenetics, as a starting point in the
   establishment of the biomimetician's biological tools and practices.
   After a descriptive phase identifying specific needs and potential
   conceptual bridges, we presented various ways of applying biological
   expertise during biomimetic processes in the prescriptive phase of the
   study. Finally, we discussed current limitations and future research
   axes.}},

Abstract = {{A video game is an interactive software able to arouse intense emotions
   in players. Consequentially, different theories have been proposed to
   understand which game aspects are able to affect the players' emotional
   state. However, only few works have tried to use empirical evidence to
   investigate the effects of different game aspects of the players'
   emotions. In this paper, we present the results of a set of experiments
   aimed at predicting the players' emotions during video games sessions
   using their physiological data. We have created a physiological dataset
   from the data acquired by 33 participants during video game fruition
   using a standard monitor and a Virtual Reality headset. The dataset
   contains information about electrocardiogram, 5 facials
   electromyographies, electrodermal activity, and respiration.
   Furthermore, we have asked the players to self-assess their emotional
   state on the Arousal and Valence space. We have then analyzed the
   contribution of each physiological signal to the overall definition of
   the players' mental state. Finally, we have applied Machine Learning
   techniques to predict the emotional state of players during game
   sessions at a precision of one second. The obtained results can
   contribute to define game devices and engines able to detect
   physiological data, as well to improve the game design process.}},

Title = {{Digital tools as promoters for person-centered care practices in chronic
   care? Healthcare professionals' experiences from rheumatology care}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundPerson-centered care (PCC) emphasize the importance of
   supporting individuals' involvement in care provided and self-care. PCC
   has become more important in chronic care as the number of people living
   with chronic conditions is increasing due to the demographic changes.
   Digital tools have potential to support interaction between patients and
   healthcare providers, but empirical examples of how to achieve PCC in
   chronic care and the role of digital tools in this process is limited.
   The aim of this study was to investigate strategies to achieve PCC used
   by the healthcare professionals at an outpatient Rheumatology clinic
   (RC), the strategies' relation to digital tools, and the perceived
   impact of the strategies on healthcare professionals and
   patients.MethodsA single case study design was used. The qualitative
   data consisted of 14 semi-structured interviews and staff meeting
   minutes, covering the time period 2017-2019. The data were analyzed
   using conventional content analysis, complemented with document
   analyses.ResultsTen strategies on two levels to operationalize PCC, and
   three categories of perceived impact were identified. On the individual
   patient level strategies involved several digital tools focusing on
   flexible access to care, mutual information sharing and the distribution
   of initiatives, tasks, and responsibilities from provider to patients.
   On the unit level, strategies concerned involving patient
   representatives and individual patients in development of digital
   services and work practices. The roles of both professionals and
   patients were affected and the importance of behavioral and cultural
   change became clear.ConclusionsBy providing an empirical example from
   chronic care the study contributes to the knowledge on strategies for
   achieving PCC, how digital tools and work practices interact, and how
   they can affect healthcare staff, patients and the unit. A conclusion is
   that the use of the digital tools, spanning over different dimensions of
   engagement, facilitated the healthcare professionals' interaction with
   patients and the patients' involvement in their own care. Digital tools
   complemented, rather than replaced, care practices.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancement in rotation sensitivity is achieved in a
   parity-time-symmetric gyroscope consisting of a ring with gain coupled
   to a lossy ring, operated below laser threshold and in the vicinity of
   its exceptional point (EP). An external laser and a conventional readout
   system are used to measure the large rotation-induced shifts in
   resonance frequency known to occur in this device. A complete model of
   the rotation sensitivity is derived that accounts for gain saturation
   caused by the large circulating power. Compared to a single-ring gyro,
   the sensitivity is enhanced by a factor of similar to 300 when the
   inter-ring coupling is tuned to its EP value K-EP, and similar to 2400
   when it is decreased from K-EP, even though the Sagnac frequency shift
   is then much smaller. similar to 40\% of this 2400-fold enhancement is
   assigned to a new sensing mechanism where rotation alters the gain
   saturation. These results show that this compact gyro has a far greater
   sensitivity than a conventional ring gyro, and that this improvement
   arises mostly from the gain compensating the loss, as opposed to the
   enhanced Sagnac frequency shift from the EP. This gyro is also shown to
   be much more stable against gain fluctuations than a single-ring gyro
   with gain. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sustaining rural water services in Viet Nam requires an improved
   understanding of the costs and relative opportunities, especially given
   the government's support for private sector involvement in expanding
   water schemes. In particular, the life-cycle costs associated with the
   delivery of safe and sustainable water services in rural Viet Nam, as
   indeed elsewhere, are not well known, potentially compromising their
   long-term sustainability. To address this gap, this study assessed the
   cost structures of 14 water schemes in Viet Nam managed by private
   enterprises. Results showed that both capital and operational
   expenditures varied widely across the schemes assessed, reflective of
   the diversity of the age and characteristics of the schemes studied.
   Twelve of the 14 schemes generated a cash profit in the most recent
   calendar year; however, when taking into account depreciation, as well
   as historical subsidies and connection fee payments, only four of the
   schemes were profitable based on a 20-year design life assumption. The
   study complements previous research demonstrating barriers to achieving
   universal access when relying on user-pays systems. The results provide
   a useful reference point to inform business planning for enterprises, as
   well as policy and support mechanisms important for securing sustainable
   rural water supply services.}},

Abstract = {{Farmer co-operatives in the United States in general outlive other types
   of business organisations, yet the overall population has been declining
   for decades. We address the paradox with survival analysis of 2260
   farmer cooperatives in the United States from 2004 through 2017. Using a
   competing risks scenario, we estimate the cumulative incidence of (i)
   mergers and acquisitions and (ii) liquidations and dissolutions in
   relation to demographic, financial, and strategic firm-level
   characteristics. We observe both expected relationships, such as the
   high incidence of liquidations and dissolutions in case of high
   leverage, as well as unexpected relationships, including the relatively
   high incidence of mergers and acquisitions among larger farmer
   co-operatives. Based on our results, we advise academics to continue to
   conceptualize the failure of farmer co-operatives as a multidimensional
   construct. However, we also recommend an alternative perspective of
   mergers and acquisitions as survival strategies as opposed to exit
   strategies.}},

   body mass to aid regional emergency management planning in Aotearoa New
   Zealand}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{51}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: People have been left behind in disasters directly
   associated with their size, shape, and weight and are disproportionately
   impacted in pandemics. Despite alignment with known vulnerabilities such
   as poverty, age, and disability, the literature is inaudible on body
   mass. Emergency managers report little or no information on body mass
   prevalence. This exploratory study aimed to illustrate population
   prevalence of high body mass for emergency planning.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data from the New Zealand Health Survey were
   pooled for the years 2013/14-2017/18 (n = 68 053 adults aged >= 15
   years). Height and weight were measured and used to calculate body mass
   index. The prevalence of high body mass were mapped to emergency
   management boundary shapefiles. The resulting maps were piloted with
   emergency managers.
   Results: Maps highlight the population prevalence of high body mass
   across emergency management regions, providing a visual tool. A pilot
   with 14 emergency managers assessed the utility of such mapping. On the
   basis of the visual information, the tool prompted 12 emergency managers
   to consider such groups in regional planning and to discuss needs.
   Conclusions: Visual mapping is a useful tool to highlight population
   prevalence of groups likely to be at higher risk in disasters. This is
   believed to be the first study to map high body mass for the purposes of
   emergency planning. Future research is required to identify prevalence
   at a finer geographical scale. More features in the local context such
   as physical location features, risk and vulnerability features could
   also be included in future research.}},

Abstract = {{Currently approved immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies targeting the
   PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptor pathways are powerful treatment options for
   certain cancers; however, most patients across cancer types still fail
   to respond. Consequently, there is interest in discovering and blocking
   alternative pathways that mediate immune suppression. One such mechanism
   is an upregulation of sialoglycans in malignancy, which has been
   recently shown to inhibit immune cell activation through multiple
   mechanisms and therefore represents a targetable glycoimmune checkpoint.
   Since these glycans are not canonically druggable, we designed an aHER2
   antibody-sialidase conjugate that potently and selectively strips
   diverse sialoglycans from breast cancer cells. In syngeneic breast
   cancer models, desialylation enhanced immune cell infiltration and
   activation and prolonged the survival of mice, an effect that was
   dependent on expression of the Siglec-E checkpoint receptor found on
   tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Thus, antibody-sialidase conjugates
   represent a promising modality for glycoimmune checkpoint therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Violet sea squirts are noteworthy model organisms, because they provide
   insights into various physiologic processes, including cell senescence,
   ageing, apoptosis and allorecognition. Consequently, their culture is
   critical to permit experimental studies. Most papers refer to short
   periods of rearing using various feeds, both living and conserved,
   missing a formal justification for their use or indications of their
   actual nutritional value. Here, we use two behavioural responses-the
   percentage of open siphons and the frequency of zooid contractions-as
   compared to the abundance of suspended microparticles during feeding
   tests, to identify feeds able to promote filter-feeding. The results
   will enable to formulate compound diets that maximise positive
   physiological responses. Our tests demonstrated that plant items, such
   as dry microalgae and cyanobacteria (Arthrospira platensis, commercially
   known as Spirulina), along with living planktonic Haptophyta (Isochrysis
   galbana), trigger clear positive reactions, represented by a higher
   frequency of zooid contractions and larger proportions of open siphons.
   These responses correspond to decreases in the concentrations of
   suspended microparticles during the experiment and indicate higher
   filter-feeding activity. In contrast, feeds commonly administered to
   colonies, such as milk powder, dried eggs and artificial plankton,
   triggered negative behavioural responses, and their intake was lower
   during the feeding trials.}},

Abstract = {{The inducted paper discusses economic effect resulting from industrial

   country of selection represents Poland. Economic impact is scrutinized
   through reflexing on gross domestic product. Industrial segment is
   deputized over various indicators whose scope strives to include
   different views on the industry field. The main point of this paper is
   to identify the exact relationship between dependent variable (gross
   domestic product) and a group of independent variables (picked
   industrial representatives). Such determination offers thereafter the
   possibility to estimate dependent variable's value and its next
   forecast. What is more, the eventual sorting of involved industrial
   indicators is facilitated according to their importance. The multiple
   regression analysis is utilized as the method of investigation. Findings
   answer the stated questions and aims with a suggestion of an appropriate

Abstract = {{The idea of interreligious dialogue has gained worldwide traction in the
   last decades and has been promoted as a key component for religious
   peace. The aim of the article is to examine how interreligious
   aspirations and practices crystallize in different settings - namely
   diplomacy, governance and activism - and are shaped by the particular
   historical and political dynamics of each of these settings. The article
   explains how the plasticity of the idea of interreligious dialogue
   contributes to foster its popularity across different domains while
   serving to convey a wide range of meanings and expectations regarding
   interreligious pasts, presents and futures. Geographically, the article
   focuses on Spain and is based on qualitative fieldwork. The article
   shows that there have been considerable efforts to promote
   interreligious initiatives and that the global interreligious narrative
   has been re-fashioned locally, by including the idea of Al-Andalus as a
   lighthouse. However, the image of Spain and its history, as a
   foundational space for interreligious dialogue and multi-religious
   coexistence is contested by the current growth of extreme-right
   movements, and parties re-claiming the Christian foundational narrative
   of the country put this kind of initiative in peril.}},

Title = {{Vitamin D and COVID-19: evidence and recommendations for supplementation}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Vitamin D is a hormone that acts on many genes expressed by immune
   cells. Evidence linking vitamin D deficiency with COVID-19 severity is
   circumstantial but considerable-links with ethnicity, obesity,
   institutionalization; latitude and ultraviolet exposure; increased lung
   damage in experimental models; associations with COVID-19 severity in
   hospitalized patients. Vitamin D deficiency is common but readily
   preventable by supplementation that is very safe and cheap. A target
   blood level of at least 50 nmol l(-1), as indicated by the US National
   Academy of Medicine and by the European Food Safety Authority, is
   supported by evidence. This would require supplementation with 800
   IU/day (not 400 IU/day as currently recommended in UK) to bring most
   people up to target. Randomized placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D
   in the community are unlikely to complete until spring 2021-although we
   note the positive results from Spain of a randomized trial of
   25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3 or calcifediol) in hospitalized patients.
   We urge UK and other governments to recommend vitamin D supplementation
   at 800-1000 IU/day for all, making it clear that this is to help
   optimize immune health and not solely for bone and muscle health. This
   should be mandated for prescription in care homes, prisons and other
   institutions where people are likely to have been indoors for much of
   the summer. Adults likely to be deficient should consider taking a
   higher dose, e.g. 4000 IU/day for the first four weeks before reducing
   to 800 IU-1000 IU/day. People admitted to the hospital with COVID-19
   should have their vitamin D status checked and/or supplemented and
   consideration should be given to testing high-dose calcifediol in the
   RECOVERY trial. We feel this should be pursued with great urgency.
   Vitamin D levels in the UK will be falling from October onwards as we
   head into winter. There seems nothing to lose and potentially much to
   gain.}},

Abstract = {{Transformerless inverters are extensively employed in grid-connected
   photovoltaic (PV) generation systems due to its advantages of achieving
   low cost and high efficiency. However, the common-mode voltage issues
   have been motivated the proposition of new topologies, control, and
   modulation schemes. In common ground PV inverters, the grid neutral line
   is directly connected to the negative pole of the dc bus. Therefore, the
   parasitic capacitances are bypassed and the leakage current can be
   eliminated. In this paper, a five-level common ground transformerless
   inverter with reduced output harmonic content for PV systems is
   proposed. In addition, the proposed inverter can process reactive power
   and it presents a maximum dc-voltage utilization in opposition to
   half-bridge-based topologies. The operation modes of the proposed
   inverter, a simple modulation strategy, as well as the design guidelines
   are analyzed in detail. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the
   feasibility and good performance of the proposed inverter.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we investigate a homogeneous discrete time risk model
   with a generalized premium income rate which can be any natural number.
   We derive theorems and give numerical examples for finite and ultimate

   proved statements for ultimate time survival probability calculation, at
   some level, are similar to the previously known statements for
   non-homogeneous risk models, where required initial values of survival
   probability for some recurrent formulas are gathered by certain limit
   laws. We also give a simplified proof that a ruin is almost unavoidable
   with a neutral net profit condition and state several conjectures on a
   certain type of recurrent matrices non-singularity. All the research
   done can be interpreted as a possibility that symmetric or asymmetric
   random walk (r.w.) hits (or not) the line u+kappa t and that possibility
   is directly related to the expected value of r.w. generating random

Abstract = {{Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) research involves the infection
   of otherwise healthy participants with disease often for the sake of
   vaccine development. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the urgency of
   enhancing CHIM research capability and the importance of having clear
   ethical guidance for their conduct. The payment of CHIM participants is
   a controversial issue involving stakeholders across ethics, medicine and
   policymaking with allegations circulating suggesting exploitation,
   coercion and other violations of ethical principles. There are multiple
   approaches to payment: reimbursement, wage payment and unlimited
   payment. We introduce a new Payment for Risk Model, which involves
   paying for time, pain and inconvenience and for risk associated with
   participation. We give philosophical arguments based on utility,
   fairness and avoidance of exploitation to support this. We also examine
   a cross-section of the UK public and CHIM experts. We found that CHIM
   participants are currently paid variable amounts. A representative
   sample of the UK public believes CHIM participants should be paid
   approximately triple the UK minimum wage and should be paid for the risk
   they endure throughout participation. CHIM experts believe CHIM
   participants should be paid more than double the UK minimum wage but are
   divided on the payment for risk. The Payment for Risk Model allows risk
   and pain to be accounted for in payment and could be used to determine
   ethically justifiable payment for CHIM participants.
   Although many research guidelines warn against paying large amounts or
   paying for risk, our empirical findings provide empirical support to the
   growing number of ethical arguments challenging this status quo. We
   close by suggesting two ways (value of statistical life or consistency
   with risk in other employment) by which payment for risk could be
   calculated.}},

Title = {{Nonstenotic Carotid Plaque in Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source
   Interplay of Arterial and Atrial Disease}},
Journal = {{STROKE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3737-3741}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose:
   Approximately one-sixth of all ischemic strokes are attributable to
   embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Recent analyses suggest
   that atrial cardiopathy and nonstenotic carotid plaque (nsCP) may
   represent 2 distinct underlying causes in patients with ESUS, although
   both diseases share common risk factors and are pathophysiologically
   intertwined. In this study, we, therefore, aimed to search for
   associations between nsCP and markers of atrial remodeling and function
   in patients with embolic stroke.
   Methods:
   Sixty-eight patients with ESUS or atrial fibrillation (AF)-related
   stroke proven by imaging who underwent comprehensive echocardiographic
   studies, including measurements of left atrial function and remodeling,
   were considered. Patients with ESUS underwent a follow-up of at least 1
   year after index stroke. For 20 patients with ESUS, NT-proBNP
   (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) values were available.
   Presence of nsCP was evaluated considering Duplex sonography and
   computed tomography angiography and was further categorized in possibly
   or probably symptomatic nsCP.
   Results:
   ESUS patients with nsCP tended to have higher values of septal and
   lateral total atrial conduction times (P=0.071 and P=0.072,
   respectively), left atrial volume index (P=0.077), and revealed
   significantly higher strain rates during early diastole (P=0.013) as
   well as higher NT-proBNP values (P=0.010) than ESUS patients without
   nsCP. Moreover, septal total atrial conduction time was significantly
   longer in ESUS patients with possibly symptomatic nsCP compared with
   those without (P=0.015). Comparison of ESUS with AF patients revealed
   significantly higher proportions of nsCP (P=0.010), possibly symptomatic
   nsCP (P=0.037), and probably symptomatic nsCP (P=0.036) in patients with
   atrial fibrillation-related stroke. In the regression analysis adjusted
   for vascular risk factors probably symptomatic nsCP remained
   significantly associated with AF (P=0.048, odds ratio: 4.46 {[}95\% CI,
   1.02-19.56]).
   Conclusions:
   Presence of nsCP is associated with AF and markers of left atrial
   disease in patients with embolic stroke. Therefore, a thorough
   evaluation regarding atrial cardiopathy and AF in patients with ESUS
   should not be restricted if nsCP are found, even if high-risk plaque
   characteristics are evident.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of repeated dosing of a dexmedetomidine oromucosal gel for
   treatment of noise aversion in dogs over a series of noise events}},
Journal = {{VETERINARY RECORD}},

Volume = {{187}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background Noise aversion is a common behavioural disorder in dogs;
   affected dogs show fear behaviours in response to noise stimuli.
   Pharmacological treatment is effective for many dogs; clinical reports
   suggest anxiolytic treatment lowers the need for treatment over time. We
   aimed to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine oromucosal gel for dogs
   with noise aversion over a series of noise events. Furthermore, we
   evaluated burden of care for owners of dogs with noise aversion via
   questionnaire.
   Methods Owners of enrolled dogs completed records for 10 noise events
   indicating whether their dog received dexmedetomidine gel and
   pretreatment and post-treatment anxiety scores; adverse events were
   noted. Owners were queried about burden of care.
   Results Twenty-two client-owned dogs completed recordings for 10 events.
   Logistic regression results showed a significant effect for time of
   event with decreased probability of receiving treatment for subsequent
   events (OR=0.75, P=0.0017). Within an event, significant improvement in
   anxiety was seen (median improvement 11 points; paired Wilcoxon;
   P<0.0001). We found overall burden of care was manageable, yet many
   owners agreed with statements regarding frustration (42 per cent),
   stress (46 per cent), guilt (42 per cent) and sadness (75 per cent)
   about their dog's condition.
   Conclusions Repeated use of dexmedetomidine gel for noise events
   resulted in decreased need for administration. Burden of care is
   important to discuss with clients.}},

Abstract = {{The enormous progress made in recent years in the field of information
   and communication technology and also in sensor and computer technology
   has affected numerous fields of medicine and is capable of inducing even
   radical changes in diagnostic and therapeutic processes. This is
   particularly true for cardiology, where, for example, telemetric
   monitoring of cardiac and circulatory functions has been in use for many
   years. Nevertheless, broad application of newer telemedical processes
   has not yet been achieved to the extent one would expect from the
   encouraging results of numerous clinical studies in this field and the
   state of the art of the underlying technology. In the present paper, the
   Working Group on Rhythmology of the Austrian Cardiological Society aims
   to provoke a critical discussion of the digital change in cardiology and
   to make recommendations for the implementation of those telemedical
   processes that have been shown to exert positive effects on a wide
   variety of medical and economic parameters. The greatest benefit of
   telecardiological applications is certainly to be found in the long-term
   care of patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. Accordingly,
   follow-up care of patients with cardiological rhythm implants,
   management of chronic heart failure and secondary prevention following
   an acute cardiac event during rehabilitation are currently the most
   important fields of application. Telemedicine is intended to enable
   high-quality and cost-efficient care for an increasing number of
   patients, whose care poses one of the greatest challenges to our
   healthcare system. Not least of all, telemedicine should make a decisive
   contribution to improving the quality of life of this segment of the
   population by favorably influencing mortality, morbidity and
   hospitalization as well as the patient's contribution to treatment.}},

   using mass spectrometric imaging. We found that increasing
   high-curvature lipid species and decreasing low-curvature lipids in the
   cell membrane favor the formation of a longer-lasting exocytotic fusion
   pore, resulting in higher release fraction for individual exocytotic
   events. The lipid changes observed following repetitive stimuli are
   similar to those after exposure to the cognitive enhancing drug,
   methylphenidate, examined in a previous study, and offer an interesting
   point of view regarding the link between plasticity and memory and

Journal = {{COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{86}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a serious disease that endangers human
   health and life. In recent years, the morbidity and mortality of CHD are
   increasing significantly. Because of the particularity and complexity of
   medical image, it is challenging to segment coronary artery accurately
   and efficiently. This paper proposes a novel global feature embedded
   network for better coronary arteries segmentation in 3D coronary
   computed tomography angiography (CTA) data. The global feature combines
   multi-level layers from various stages of the network, which contains
   semantic information and detailed features, aiming to accurately segment
   target with precise boundary. In addition, we integrate a group of
   improved noisy activating functions with parameters into our network to
   eliminate the impact of noise in CTA data. And we improve the learning
   active contour model, which obtains a refined segmentation result with
   smooth boundary based on the high-quality score map produced by the
   networks. The experimental results show that the proposed framework
   achieved the state-of-the-art performance intuitively and quantitively.}},

Title = {{Effect of cornstalk biochar on phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated soil
   by Beta vulgaris var. cicla L}},
Journal = {{ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{205}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Cadmium (Cd) contamination is the most common and extensive heavy metal
   pollution in the farmland of China. Phytoremediation is considered as a
   promising measure for Cd-contaminated soil remediation, but the
   remediation efficiency still needs to be enhanced. Biochar as an
   effective amendment medium is widely manufactured and studied for the
   soil remediation of heavy metals. In this study, a greenhouse pot trial
   was conducted to investigate the effects of cornstalk biochar on Cd
   accumulation of Beta vulgaris var. cicla L. (Beta vulgaris) in Cd
   contaminated soil. The Cd availability, speciation and nutrients in
   soil, biomass and Cd chemical forms in the Beta vulgaris root were
   studied to explore the mechanism that how the cornstalk biochar promoted
   Cd accumulation in Beta vulgaris. Biochar amendment reduced the
   DTPA-extractable Cd concentration and stimulated the growth of root.
   Compared to the Beta vulgaris without biochar treatment, the results of
   5\% biochar amendment showed that the root dry weight of Beta vulgaris
   increased to 267\%, Cd accumulation in Beta vulgaris increased to 206\%
   and the Cd concentration in leaves and mots increased by 36\% and 52\%,
   respectively. Additionally, after 5\% biochar was applied to soil, the
   total content of organic matter-bound Cd and residual Cd increased by
   38\%, while the content of Fe-Mn oxides-bound Cd decreased by 40\%.
   Meanwhile, Cd may mainly bind to the mot cell wall and the ratio of
   NaCl-extracted Cd to HAc-extracted Cd increased to 166\% with 5\%
   biochar amendment. According to our study, Cd in soil can be removed by
   Beta vulgaris and phytoremediation efficiency can be improved with
   biochar amendment. The combination of phytoremediation and biochar
   amendment is a promising strategy for the Cd-contaminated soil
   remediation.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile computing provides storage and computation resources of proximal
   devices to satisfy the real-time and low-energy communication demands of
   the Internet of Things (IoT). However, in the areas without terrestrial
   base station infrastructures, the IoT sensors have trouble implementing
   reliable and stable connections, which results in the difficulties of
   data gathering and data caching. In this paper, we consider a
   space-air-ground integrated mobile edge caching IoT system composed of
   satellite and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where LEO satellite
   broadcasts data, and UAVs collect the data from decentralized ground
   sensors. Since the sensors' low-power property leads data loss,
   fault-tolerant codes are employed for availability protection. We first
   derive the exact expressions of system availability and communication
   cost for data repair and collection. Then, to address the problems of
   the lower availability, we exploit an intelligent optimization to
   determine the erasure coding parameters. Lastly, we further optimize the
   system parameters, i.e., communication ranges and unit power costs of
   UAV and decentralized sensors, to minimize the total communication cost.
   Simulation results show that, compared to MDS codes and regenerating
   codes, adaptive minimum storage regenerating (AMSR) codes with optimized
   parameters can significantly reduce total communication cost and
   maintain availability of the system.}},

Title = {{Component Combination Rules of Wind Load Effects of Building Structures}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Under the action of the same wind azimuth, the extreme values of the
   wind load effect components of building structures are generated in the
   along-wind, cross-wind, vertical, and torsional directions. In designing
   the wind-resistant structure, the extreme values of effect components
   need to be combined to determine the internal force envelope values of
   members. Complete quadratic combination (CQC) and Turkstra combination
   rules are often used to determine the combination value of extreme
   values of wind effect components. The extreme probability distribution
   expressions of the CQC, and the Turkstra and approximate rules, are
   derived. The simplified combination Equations and combination
   coefficients of the CQC and Turkstra approximate rules are proposed in
   this paper. We use the combination Equations and Monte Carlo simulation
   method to analyze the accuracy of Turkstra and its approximate rules.
   The results show that the combination extreme is associated with the
   correlation coefficients, mean values, ratios of standard deviations,
   and fluctuating extremes of effect components. The errors between
   Turkstra and its approximate rules are small when load effect components
   show a positive correlation. The errors are largest when the standard
   deviations of components are equal. Our research results provide a
   theoretical basis for the combination method of wind load effect
   components of building structures.}},

Abstract = {{The roles of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) temperatures (490 degrees

   the microstructure and properties of AlSi7Cu2Mg alloy step castings with
   three types wall thicknesses were studied. The experimental results show
   that HIP at 490 degrees C could effectively eliminate the internal
   closed porosity of the castings with a wall thickness of <= 40 mm, but
   for heavy castings (70 mm), even HIP at 530 degrees C, a few loose
   defects remained inside the castings. Two types of incipient eutectics
   containing Al5Mg8Si6Cu2 and Al2Cu were observed in the samples that HIP
   at 530 degrees C, which was responsible for the decrease of the tensile
   strength of the castings within the medium wall thickness (40 mm)
   compared with that HIP at 490 degrees C. HIP could greatly reduce the
   difference of the tensile strength values of castings with wall
   thicknesses 17 mm and 70 mm from 117.93 MPa (without HIP) to 25.7 MPa
   (with HIP at 530 degrees C).}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY NANO}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Orthosilicate compounds are emerging as a promising class of low-cost
   and intrinsically safe cathodes due to the strong inductive effects of
   polyanion groups for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. However,
   enabling two-electron redox reaction and actualizing the appealing high
   theoretical capacity of similar to 270 mAh g(-1) for orthosilicates
   remain challenging. Here, fully reversible two-electron redox reaction
   in sodium iron orthosilicate cathodes by fluorine doping are reported.
   Owing to the unlocking of the Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couple, F-doped Na2FeSiO4
   displays exceptionally high capacity of 271 mAh g(-)1 that has never
   been reported for polyanionic cathodes. Based on the newly built crystal
   structure model of triclinic phase, fluorine doping is demonstrated to
   greatly promote charge redistribution and accelerate the electron
   exchange, hosting more sodium ions in the framework and stabilizing Fe4+
   containing intermediate phases thermodynamically. The zero-strain
   characteristics of fluorine-doped orthosilicate ensure its excellent
   cycling stability with 93.7\% capacity retention over 200 cycles. The
   successful unlocking of the trapped sodium in orthosilicates provides
   valuable insights and opens up a new avenue for the development of high
   capacity cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{An analysis of the managerial performance of Italian museums using a
   generalised conditional efficiency model}},
Journal = {{SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{72}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Museums are important cultural institutions having the mission of
   conserving, interpreting, researching and displaying heritage. The
   evaluation of their efficiency has been extensively investigated in the
   literature using different approaches and methods. In this paper, we
   employ a generalised conditional efficiency model to assess the true
   efficiency of Italian museums, i.e. the efficiency in the provision of
   museums' service potential, consistently dealing with the impact of the
   socio-demographic and institutional environment in which museums
   operate. Results show that the operational environment matters. In
   particular, conditional estimates suggest that higher income levels and
   larger hospitality sectors positively influence museums efficiency.
   Ownership matters: museums' service potential is higher for private
   institutions while, among public institutions, efficiency is generally
   lower for state-owned museums.}},

Title = {{Treatment of Left Ventricular Thrombus With Direct Oral Anticoagulants:
   A Retrospective Observational Study}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: There is limited data on the efficacy of direct oral
   anticoagulants (DOACs) for the treatment of left ventricular thrombus.
   Currently, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) remain the preferred oral
   anticoagulant for left ventricular thrombus. In this retrospective
   study, we assessed the safety and efficacy of DOACs in comparison to
   VKAs in patients with a new diagnosis of left ventricular thrombus.
   METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients admitted to the 5
   Catholic Health Initiative Omaha hospitals with a diagnosis of left
   ventricular thrombus between January 2012 and March 2019 and were
   discharged on oral anticoagulants. Patients were stratified into 2
   groups: VKAs or DOACs and followed for up to 1 year. We compared the
   outcomes of ischemic stroke, bleeding, and echocardiographic resolution
   of left ventricular thrombus between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were included in this study (mean age:
   61 years, 29\% females). Of these, 80 (81\%) were discharged on VKAs and
   19 (19\%) on DOACs. Stroke within 1 year of diagnosis occurred in 2
   patients in the VKA group and none in the DOAC group (P = 0.49).
   Bleeding events were observed in 5 patients (4 in the VKA group and 1 in
   the DOAC group; P = 0.96). Ninety patients had follow-up echocardiogram;
   resolution of left ventricular thrombus was similar between the 2 groups
   (VKAs vs DOACs: 81\% vs 80\%; P = 0.9).
   CONCLUSION: In patients with left ventricular thrombus, DOACs and VKAs
   had similar rates of stroke and bleeding. These findings need
   confirmation in randomized clinical trials. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Featured Application
   Contactless pervasive health monitoring incl. cognitive stress analysis.
   Remote photo-plethysmography (rPPG) uses a camera to estimate a person's
   heart rate (HR). Similar to how heart rate can provide useful
   information about a person's vital signs, insights about the underlying
   physio/psychological conditions can be obtained from heart rate
   variability (HRV). HRV is a measure of the fine fluctuations in the
   intervals between heart beats. However, this measure requires temporally
   locating heart beats with a high degree of precision. We introduce a
   refined and efficient real-time rPPG pipeline with novel filtering and
   motion suppression that not only estimates heart rates, but also
   extracts the pulse waveform to time heart beats and measure heart rate
   variability. This unsupervised method requires no rPPG specific training
   and is able to operate in real-time. We also introduce a new multi-modal
   video dataset, VicarPPG 2, specifically designed to evaluate rPPG
   algorithms on HR and HRV estimation. We validate and study our method
   under various conditions on a comprehensive range of public and
   self-recorded datasets, showing state-of-the-art results and providing
   useful insights into some unique aspects. Lastly, we make available
   CleanerPPG, a collection of human-verified ground truth peak/heart-beat
   annotations for existing rPPG datasets. These verified annotations
   should make future evaluations and benchmarking of rPPG algorithms more
   accurate, standardized and fair.}},

Title = {{The spatiotemporal dynamics of invasive three-spined sticklebacks in a
   large, deep lake and possible options for stock reduction}},
Journal = {{FISHERIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{232}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A combination of fishing and surveying methods (trawling, gillnetting,
   electrofishing and hydroacoustics) were used to obtain insight into the
   spatiotemporal dynamics of invasive three-spined sticklebacks
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in the pelagic zone of Upper Lake Constance.
   The resulting information is highly pertinent to the development of
   management strategies to reduce the negative impact of sticklebacks on
   the pelagic ecosystem of the lake, and especially on the commercially
   important native pelagic whitefish (Coregonus wartmanni). The results
   indicate that sticklebacks are very mobile and opportunistic with
   respect to habitat selection, making extensive shifts between benthic
   and pelagic habitats. The greatest abundances of sticklebacks in the
   pelagic zone were identified in late summer, shortly after their
   spawning, when densities exceeding 10,000 individuals per hectare were
   recorded. A second peak occurred in winter, during the spawning season
   of pelagic whitefish. Data from gillnetting indicate high stickleback
   densities in the littoral zone of the lake during the spawning season of
   benthic whitefish (Coregonus macrophthalmus). Thus, damaging predation
   of pelagic and benthic whitefish eggs and larvae by sticklebacks seems
   very likely. Electrofishing surveys in tributary rivers revealed that
   these were used irregularly as migration routes and are therefore
   unlikely to represent a significant habitat for stickleback
   reproduction. Depth distribution of sticklebacks in the pelagic zone
   changed throughout the year with highest densities at depths of 9-12 m
   in spring, summer and autumn, while in winter densities were highest at
   15-18 m. The most efficient option for capturing sticklebacks is
   trawling during September, at depths of 9-12 m, where very large catches
   were recorded without significant bycatch of non-target species. This
   method of control would require special fishing vessels not currently
   deployed on the lake and its economic feasibility will require careful
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: To determine the effect of peripheral CRF on intestinal
   barrier function in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). Irritable bowel
   syndrome (IBS) pathophysiology has been linked to life stress,
   epithelial barrier dysfunction, and mast cell activation.
   Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a major mediator of stress
   responses in the gastrointestinal tract, yet its role on IBS mucosal
   function remains largely unknown. METHODS: Intestinal response to
   sequential i.v. 5-mL saline solution (placebo) and CRF (100 mu g) was
   evaluated in 21 IBS-D and 17 healthy subjects (HSs). A 20-cm jejunal
   segment was perfused with an isosmotic solution and effluents collected
   at baseline, 30 minutes after placebo, and 60 minutes after CRF. We
   measured water flux, albumin output, tryptase release, stress hormones,
   cardiovascular and psychological responses, and abdominal pain. A
   jejunal biopsy was obtained for CRF receptor expression assessment.
   RESULTS: Water flux did not change after placebo in IBS-D and HS but
   significantly increased after CRF in IBS-D (P = 0.007). Basal luminal
   output of albumin was higher in IBS-D and increased further after CRF in
   IBS-D (P = 0.042). Basal jejunal tryptase release was higher in IBS-D,
   and CRF significantly increased it in both groups (P = 0.004), the
   response being higher in IBS-D than in HS (P = 0.0023). Abdominal pain
   worsened only in IBS-D after CRF and correlated with jejunal tryptase
   release, water flux, and albumin output. IBS-D displayed jejunal
   up-regulation of CRF2 and down-regulation of CRF1 compared with HS.
   DISCUSSION: Stress via CRF-driven mast cell activation seems to be
   relevant in the pathophysiology of IBS-D.}},

Abstract = {{Infrared free-space optics (FSO) provide an attractive solution for
   ultra-high-capacity wireless communications. However, the full potential
   of FSO is still being hindered by the apparent random fluctuations on
   the received optical power, which can be triggered by external factors
   such as atmospheric turbulence, weather instability, and pointing
   errors. Through the analysis of long-term experimental measurements, we
   identify the existence of significant time-domain memory in outdoor FSO
   links, which is found to be particularly strong under rainy weather
   conditions. Following this observation, we demonstrate that these memory
   effects can be effectively utilized to design accurate FSO channel
   estimation algorithms. Taking advantage of the arbitrary bit-rate
   granularity provided by probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS), and
   resorting to a simple moving average channel estimator, we demonstrate
   400G+ transmission over a seamless fiber-FSO 55-m link with enhanced
   resilience towards adverse weather conditions. Comparing with
   unsupervised fixed modulation, we demonstrate a significant increase in
   average bit-rate (>35 Gbps) after continuous measurement over 3 hours,
   including raining periods.}},

Abstract = {{According to the FAIR guiding principles, one of the central attributes
   for maximizing the added value of information artifacts is
   interoperability. In this paper, I discuss the importance, and propose a
   characterization of the notion of Semantic Interoperability. Moreover, I
   show that a direct consequence of this view is that Semantic
   Interoperability cannot be achieved without the support of, on one hand,
   (i) ontologies, as meaning contracts capturing the conceptualizations
   represented in information artifacts and, on the other hand, of (ii)
   Ontology, as a discipline proposing formal meth- ods and theories for
   clarifying these conceptualizations and articulating their
   representations. In particular, I discuss the fundamental role of formal
   ontological theories (in the latter sense) to properly ground the
   construction of representation languages, as well as methodological and
   computational tools for supporting the engineering of ontologies (in the
   former sense) in the context of FAIR.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate wound healing
   abilities and efficacy of topical Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and
   acetylcysteine for their possible clinical use. Methods: The study was
   conducted on 36 eyes of 18 single-breed rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus,
   of both sexes. A 7.5 mm calibrated vacuum corneal trephine was used to
   induce a defect of 100 micron depth in center of both the corneas. The
   right eye of rabbits was selected as the control eye and the left eye as
   the trial eye, which received eyedrops as Group 1-10\% Vitamin C
   eyedrops, Group 2-3\% acetylcysteine eye drops, and Group 3-1\% Vitamin
   E eye drops. Control eyes received ringer lactate. Evaluation was done
   for fluorescein stain positivity, epithelial defect size, and corneal
   haze on Day 2, Day 7, and Day 14 post induction of the epithelial
   defect. Results: On day 14, three eyes of control group, all Vitamin C
   and acetylcysteine treated eyes, and four Vitamin E treated eyes were
   fluorescein stain negative. The mean defect area on day 14 was 0, 0,
   0.13, and 1.86 mm(2) in Vitamin C, Vitamin E, acetylcysteine, and
   control eyes, respectively. Vitamin C and Vitamin E control corneal haze
   better than acetylcysteine in experimentally induced corneal wounds in
   rabbits. Conclusion: The three trial drugs with different mechanism of
   action showed similar effect on healing of the experimentally created
   corneal wounds in rabbits, with comparison showing statistical
   insignificance.}},

   informed grounded theory study}},
Journal = {{HELIYON}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: School leaders are charged with making equitable decisions
   almost daily, but little about this process is known. Due to research
   suggesting principal implicit bias, or the stereotypes and attitudes
   held by individuals unconsciously that may or may not reflect actual
   preferences, may contribute to discipline gaps, the present study aimed
   to better understand how principals make discipline decisions and how
   implicit bias might interfere in these decisions.
   Research methods: This qualitative study used in-depth interviews and
   document analysis with six mid-Atlantic principals to explore their
   discipline decision-making processes. Constant comparative analysis
   inclusive of explicit coding and analytical procedures supported the
   development of an informed grounded theory.
   Findings: The data revealed a four-part recursive process of discipline
   decision-making inclusive of four themes relevant to equity. Principals
   used communication and data to gather information in a first step driven
   by relationships, reflected on considerations and policy to develop
   options in a second step driven by flexibility, selected an outcome in a
   third step driven by morality, and evaluated their efficacy in the
   recursive loop driven by experience.
   Implications for research and practice: The findings allow for targeted
   research of the discipline decision-making process and potential
   consideration of practical interventions and curricular design for
   principal preparation programs that would allow for greater equity in
   discipline following office referrals.}},

Abstract = {{Background: COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in disruption to routine
   health services delivery as strict lockdowns were implemented in India
   and health workforce redeployed for COVID-19 focused responses. We
   assess the perceptions about COVID-19, the impact of the lockdown on
   access to health services and continuum of care for Non-communicable
   diseases (NCDs) among a cohort of adults in rural India. Methodology:
   Since 2018, we have been following up a cohort of persons with
   non-communicable diseases in a high NCD burden region in Srikakulam
   District of Andhra Pradesh under the STOP CKDu study. We conducted this
   mixed methods study, administered through a structured telephonic
   questionnaire and interview to determine the awareness, perceptions and
   their compliance to ongoing treatment schedules. Results: Overall, 68\%
   of the participants exhibited adequate knowledge of symptoms of
   COVID-19, while 43\% were not aware of the mode of transmission of the
   virus. In all, 822 (36.1\%) participants reported at least one NCD
   condition. Among them, 115 (14\%) missed their follow-up visit, 110
   (13.4\%) reported facing challenges in medication procurement and 11.6\%
   either developed new complaints or experienced worsening of pre-existing
   symptoms. A total of 233 (28.5\%) used a telemedicine facility and took
   telephonic advice from (private) physicians. As the access to medicines
   was restricted due to the lockdown, majority of the respondents were
   depending on rural medical practitioners (RMPs) for the procurement of
   medication. Conclusion: Our finding implies the need for the future
   guidelines on adaptation of telehealth approaches within health systems
   to maintain the continuum of care, digital health tools to facilitate
   the patient's appointments including virtual follow-up visits for those
   with NCDs coupled with regular engagement by frontline healthcare
   workers at the local levels, evidence informed public health messaging
   taking into consideration the social and behavioural aspect and
   uninterrupted essential primary healthcare services.}},

Title = {{Improved evaluation method of the soil wind erosion intensity based on
   the cloud-AHP model under the stress of global climate change}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{746}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Under the stress of global climate change, soil wind erosion has become
   a major environmental issue in the Three-River Source Region (TRSR) of
   China. However, few large-scale studies have been conducted on soil wind
   erosion owing to the lack of investigational data or complex parameters.
   Moreover, the uncertainty and randomness in the weight determination
   process cannot be avoided using the traditional method. Thus, a
   cloud-analytic hierarchy process (cloud-AHP) model was proposed to
   construct a wind erosion intensity index model for the TRSR based on
   seven typical land surface parameters. The following results were
   obtained. (1) The cloud-AHP model can better eliminate the randomness
   and uncertainty in the weight determination process. (2) The proposed
   evaluation method of wind erosion intensity has better applicability in
   the TRSR with overall accuracy of 93\%. (3) The overall wind erosion
   intensity in this region is moderate. The wind erosion intensity was the
   largest in the Yangtze River (0.55, moderate erosion) and smallest in
   the source region of the Lancang River (0.50, mild erosion). (4)
   Significant differences are observed in the influences of various
   vegetation types on wind erosion intensity. Bare land exhibits the
   highest wind erosion intensity, whereas a coniferous forest exhibits the
   smallest. Moreover, grassland is a key control zone of soil and water
   conservation because it has the largest spatial heterogeneity of
   internal erosion intensity. These results can provide data and technical
   support for preventing and controlling soil erosion and protecting the
   environment in the region. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel Dy2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 (DAS) glass ceramic was designed
   and prepared for joining zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) ceramic. The
   crystallization, thermal expansion behavior and wetting behavior of the
   DAS glass filler were studied. The effect of cooling rate and joining
   temperature on the microstructure and flexural strength of joints was
   investigated. The results show that slow cooling rate (15 degrees C/min)
   leads to crystallization of brazing seam, which causes the formation of
   pores in the joints due to the large density difference between the
   glass and the crystalline phases. The dissolution of ZrO2 from ZTA
   substrate into the filler during joining process improves the mismatch
   of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the brazing seam
   and substrate. The maximum flexural strength of 535 MPa is obtained when
   the joining temperature and cooling rate are 1475 degrees C and 50
   degrees C/min, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{To establish a process for cleaning and efficiently utilizing solid
   residues and residual liquid after co fermentation of coal and corn
   straw, three coal samples combined with corn straw were used. Combustion
   tests were carried out using the solid residue to compare the changes in
   calorific value, slagging characteristics and air pollutant emission
   before and after fermentation. Biogas production experiments were
   performed using acclimated residual liquid to establish the biomethane
   production characteristics. Results show that the total calorific value
   of solid residue after co-fermentation of bituminous coal D, bituminous
   coal C and corn straw increased by 8.16\% and 8.08\%, respectively,
   compared to original samples. The slagging index also decreased during
   the combustion of solid residues. The diversity of bacterial community
   structure was the main causes for the significant reduction in air
   pollutant emissions from the combustion of solid residues. Acclimation
   experiments improved the removal rate of hemicelluloses from corn straw
   and increased biomethane production by 45.86\%, 10.66\% and 60.47\%,
   respectively. This work can improve the clean conversion efficiency of
   coal and straw, not only reducing environmental pollution, but also
   transforming waste into clean energy, which has a positive impact on the
   environment and allows the sustainable use of resources. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The nitrogen (N) influences the growth of sweet potato. However, it is
   unclear whether the different levels of N can affect starch
   physicochemical properties. In this study, 9 different colored-fleshed
   sweet potato varieties were planted in the same field with additional N
   fertilizer treatment of 0, 15 and 30 kg/ha. The physicochemical
   properties of starches from root tubers were measured. With increasing N
   level, the amylose content decreased in yellow-fleshed variety Sushu 16
   and increased in white-fleshed variety Sushu 29 and purple-fleshed
   varieties Ningzishu 1 and 4, but did not significantly change in other
   varieties. The starch size decreased in purple-fleshed variety Ningzishu
   1 and white-fleshed varieties Sushu 28 and Sushu 29 with increasing N
   treatment, but first increased then decreased in yellow-fleshed variety
   Sushu 16 and first decreased then increased in white-fleshed variety
   Sushu 24 and yellow-fleshed variety Sushu 25. The different levels of N
   treatment had no influence on protein content, crystalline structure,
   and gelatinization enthalpy of starch. The effects of N treatment on
   gelatinization temperatures and pasting viscosities of starches were
   determined by varieties and genotype backgrounds of sweet potato. The
   PLSR and PLS-DA were also carried out based on structural, thermal, and
   pasting parameters of starches. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{As for the high-precision micro-hole formation in FR-1 copper clad

   evaluation indexes to discuss the influence of the process parameters on
   the quality of micro-holes. The results show that the single pulse
   energy has the greatest impact on the quality of micro-holes and the
   repetition rate has the least influence. The optimal process parameter
   combination is set as single pulse energy of 29 mu J, repetition rate of
   92 kHz, pulse number of 2112, and defocusing amount of 0.01 mm. After

Abstract = {{Enrofloxacin (EFX) was selected as the medicinal ligand to afford a new
   copper(ii)-based complex, EFX-Cu, which was structurally characterized
   by spectroscopic analyses including X-ray single crystal diffraction. It
   was also stable and could retain the coordination state in aqueous
   solution. The in vitro antibacterial activity of EFX-Cu against a panel
   of pathogenic bacteria was about the same as that of EFX, except that it
   was twice as active against E. coli. The in vivo test on mice gave a
   LD50 value of 8148 mg kg(-1) for EFX-Cu, which was much lower than those
   for EFX (LD50, 5312 mg kg(-1)) and its clinically used sodium salt,
   EFX-Na (LD50, 1421 mg kg(-1)). In addition, no obvious lesions in the
   organs of the dead mice were found by histopathological examination.
   Pharmacokinetic studies on rats suggested similar pharmacokinetics
   between EFX-Cu and EFX. On the other hand, EFX-Cu showed higher acute
   toxicity than EFX-Na in zebrafish, which was inconsistent with that in
   mice. The ROS-related inflammation and anti-inflammatory assay of
   EFX-Cu, respectively, in normal cells and zebrafish could be ascribed to
   its ROS-related redox property. Unfortunately, the final in vivo
   therapeutic assay in the E. coli-infected mouse model indicated that the
   therapeutic effect of EFX-Cu, mainly in terms of mortality in mice, was
   found to be lower than that of EFX-Na at the same dosage (800 mg kg(-1),
   continuous gavage), although the contradictory factors between toxicity
   and antibacterial activity could not be excluded in this trial.}},

Abstract = {{An urban agglomeration is a highly connected city group, which is nested
   in complex trading networks. Ignoring the intercity connections and
   regional inequality may lead to the unsustainability of the urban

   threatening environmental sustainability and causing global climate
   change. Facing the inequality and environment pressures in the urban
   agglomeration, the cultivated land resource reallocation within the
   complex urban agglomeration trading network should be systematically
   explored. This study analyzes the virtual cultivated land flows of the

   using a multiregional input-output model. Results show that the average
   virtual cultivated land intensity of the JJJ region is 1.59 ha/million
   yuan, which is below the national average. The JJJ region has 10.74
   million ha of embodied cultivated land in consumption, accounting for
   7.82\% of the country's total amount. JJJ region is an import-oriented
   region and it receives virtual cultivated land from surrounding
   underdeveloped regions, such as Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia. Beijing
   and Tianjin are typical net importers of virtual cultivated land, while
   Zhangjiakou, Xingtai, Hengshui, Baoding, and Cangzhou are net exporters
   in the interior of the JJJ region. This study could provide a
   systematical perspective and data supporting system for formulating the
   sustainable cultivated land use policies and collaborated development
   policies in the JJJ region to mitigate regional inequality. Policy
   suggestions concerning the eco-compensation mechanism, collaborative
   innovation mode, and uniform management platform in JJJ are given.}},

Title = {{Mitigation of blackout problem for reentry vehicle in traveling magnetic
   field with induced current}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel solution mitigating the radio blackout problem is
   proposed, which improves existing traveling magnetic field (TMF)-based
   methods. The most significant advance lies in replacing the external
   injection with self-induced current, which does not require electrodes.
   The improved analytical model is derived to evaluate the electron
   density reduction taking into consideration the self-induced current for
   various TMF velocities. The plasma reduction performance is analyzed for
   several conditions including the total absence of injected current. The
   results show that the velocity may be used to trade off the injected
   current and, when sufficiently large, eliminates the need for an
   injected current while mitigating radio blackout. The effectiveness of
   this solution to the blackout problem is demonstrated in commonly used
   aerospace communication bands. With a field strength of less than 0.15
   T, increasing the velocity from 40 m s(-1)to 3100 m s(-1)is all that is
   required to obviate the need for an injected current. Moreover, typical
   reduction ratios for electronic density tolerance (2, 1.9, 1.75 and 3
   times for the L-, S-, C- and X-bands, respectively, at an altitude of 40
   km) remain unchanged. Increasing the velocity of the TMF is much easier
   than injecting current via a metal electrode into a high-temperature
   flow field. The TMF method appears practical in regard to possible
   future applications.}},

Title = {{Birth experiences of urban women of advanced age having their second
   child after introduction of the universal two-child policy in China: A
   qualitative study}},
Journal = {{MIDWIFERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{91}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: to investigate the birth experiences of women of advanced age
   having a second child in urban China after introduction of the universal
   two-child policy in 2016.
   Design: data were collected using semi-structured in-depth interviews,
   and were processed and analysed using a qualitative phenomenological
   method.
   Setting: obstetric department of a class 1, level 3 hospital in Henan
   Province, China.
   Participants: purposive sampling was undertaken, and 11 hospitalized
   women from urban backgrounds were selected as the participants. They
   were all aged > 35 years and were having their second child. The
   interviews were conducted 2-4 days post partum.
   Findings: the findings were divided into four themes: motives for the
   birth of a second child; anticipa-tions for the child's gender;
   difficulty in conceiving; and conflicts after birth. The main reason for
   having a second child was no longer in accordance with the traditional
   Chinese mindset to `raise sons to secure a happy life when one gets
   old'; instead, it was to secure family balance and harmony to respond to
   the new policy. Educated women from urban backgrounds were able to
   accept the gender of the second child `as it came', without the old
   mindset that `men are superior to women' and `only boys can carry on
   family lines'. Advanced maternal age and gestational complications were
   the major difficulties facing these women. Chinese medicine and regimens
   were recognised as effective and conducive. Following the birth of their
   second child, the women experienced both positive feelings (joy due to
   the arrival of the new baby) and negative feelings (pressures and
   challenges on family finances, demands for more living space, and
   balancing their affections between two children).
   Conclusions and implications for practice: women of advanced age who
   choose to have a second child have sensible motives and, for the most
   part, their experience is positive. That said, the participants faced
   and overcame many difficulties before, during and after the birth of
   their second child. They were in need of help from the government and
   their employers in terms of policy, and proper education on care-taking
   and recuperation from medical professionals. Families who have a second
   child should treat the second child calmly and with common sense, make
   quick adjustments to family structural changes, and strike a proper
   balance in an effort to divide love and care equally between the two
   children. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{At present, wheat straw is comprehensively studied to produce chemicals
   and biofuels, such as bioethanol, biohydrogen, and biogas. In this
   study, we used wheat straw as raw material to produce organic carboxylic
   acids in NaIO4+ H2SO4, and electron beam irradiation (EBI) pretreatment
   was used in the process to enhance the efficiency of straw conversion.
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of raw and pretreated wheat
   straw showed that surfaces have been fractured after EBI pretreatment,
   and there were many micropores distributed in the pretreated straw.
   Moreover, the experimental results showed that EBI pretreatment can
   efficiently promote the transformation of wheat straw to organic
   carboxylic acids. Effects of irradiation dose, temperature, reaction
   time, the amount of sulfuric acid and sodium periodate on the yield of
   lactic acid (LA), formic acid (FA), and acetic acid (AA) were
   investigated. The highest LAyield of 34.37\% was obtained at the optimum
   conditions (EBI 100 kGy, H2SO4 concentration 2 wt\%, NaIO4 concentration
   0.6 wt\%, reaction time 45 min, reaction temperature 200 degrees C). And
   the yields of FA and AAwere 29.16\% and 10.39\%, respectively. FT-IR
   analysis showed that hemicellulose, compared to cellulose and lignin,
   was partially removed after irradiation. The reaction pathways and
   mechanisms were inferred by analyzing the products of hydrothermal
   conversion of several intermediates.}},

Title = {{Effect of functional lateral shift of the mandible on hyaluronic acid

   rats}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major molecular component of the
   articular cartilage of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) influencing
   joint lubrication. Functional lateral shift of the mandible (FLSM) can
   lead to malocclusion. This study investigated the effects of FLSM on HA
   metabolism and lubrication of the TMJ in growing rats.
   Methods: Thirty 5-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into shift,
   recovery, and control groups. Rats in the shift and recovery groups were
   fitted with guiding plates to produce a 2-mm FLSM which were removed
   from the rats in the recovery group 14 days later. Animals were
   sacrificed at 14 and 28 days after the appliances were attached.
   Immunohistochemistry of HA-binding protein (HABP), hyaluronan synthase (
   HAS), and hyaluronoglucosaminidases (HYALs) was examined.
   Results: The thickness of HABP-positively stained areas in the lateral
   regions in the bilateral condyle was reduced during the experimental
   period in the shift group compared with that in the control group. The
   proportion of HAS2-stained areas was bilaterally decreased in different
   regions of condylar cartilage during the experimental period in the
   shift group. The reduction of the HYAL2-stained area proportion in the
   condylar cartilage was more significant than that of HYAL1 at 14 days
   after appliance attachment in the shift group. HAS2 staining was not
   recovered in the recovery group.
   Limitations: This research was based on animal experiments with a
   limited experimental period.
   Conclusion: FLSM altered lubrication related HA metabolism in the
   articular cartilage of the TMJ in growing rats.}},

   dissimilar friction stir welded joints}},

Abstract = {{Friction stir welding (FSW) can weld 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 aluminum parts
   into one integral aircraft assembly. In order to perform the integrity
   assessment of the dissimilar welded structure, the first thing is to
   identify its residual stress distribution. In this paper, 2024 and 7075
   dissimilar aluminum plates were welded by FSW, and the residual stress
   profiles of the dissimilar welded specimen were measured by the neutron
   diffraction method. A three-dimensional finite element model was used to
   calculate and compare the residual stress distributions of different
   welding parameters. Microstructure characteristics in different FSWed
   zones were studied by the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD)
   method. It is shown that the longitudinal residual stress of 7075 side
   is higher than that of 2024 side, and the maximum residual stress
   decreases from the top scan line to the bottom scan line. The transverse
   and the normal residual stresses are tensile in 7075 side, while that of
   2024 side is compressive. The numerical simulation results agree with
   the neutron diffraction measurements. The KAM map of the
   thermo-mechanical affected zone shows larger local plastic deformation
   than that of the stirred zone, which leads the longitudinal residual
   stress has the ``double peak{''} shape.}},

Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{78}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ammonia production consumes-2\% of the annual worldwide energy supply,
   therefore strategic alternatives for the energy-intensive ammonia
   synthesis through the Haber-Bosch process are of great importance to
   reduce our carbon footprint. Inspired by MoFe-nitrogenase and the
   energy-efficient and industrially feasible electrocatalytic synthesis of
   ammonia, we herein establish a catalytic electrode for artificial
   nitrogen fixation, featuring a carbon fiber cloth fully grafted by
   boron-doped molybdenum disulfide (B-MoS2/CFC) nanosheets. An excellent
   ammonia production rate of 44.09 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) is obtained at-0.2 V
   versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), whilst maintaining one
   of the best reported Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 21.72\% in acidic
   aqueous electrolyte (0.1 M HCl). Further applying a more negative
   potential of-0.25 V renders the best ammonia production rate of 50.51 mu
   g h(-1) cm(-2). A strong-weak electron polarization (SWEP) pair from the
   different electron accepting and back-donating capacities of boron and
   molybdenum (2p shell for boron and 5d shell for molybdenum) is proposed
   to facilitate greatly the adsorption of non-polar dinitrogen gas via N
   equivalent to N bond polarization and the first protonation with large
   driving force. In addition, for the first time a visible light driven
   photo-electrochemical (PEC) cell for overall production of ammonia,
   hydrogen and oxygen from water + nitrogen, is demonstrated by coupling a
   bismuth vanadate BiVO4 photo-anode with the B-MoS2/CFC catalytic
   cathode.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{242}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Although nitrates and amino acids are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, the
   interactions of amino acids with nitrates on the hygroscopicity of
   aerosols are still not clear. We studied the hygroscopic properties and
   compositional evolution of three atmospherically relevant species,
   sodium nitrate (NaNO3), glycine and L-alanine (alanine). The
   investigations on the NaNO3, glycine, alanine and their internally
   NaNO3/amino acid mixed particles with molar ratios of 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3
   were conducted using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The mixed NaNO3/glycine droplets with
   molar ratios of 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3 exhibited efflorescence transition at
   52.3\%, 62.6\% and 63.2\%RH, respectively. For the NaNO3/alanine mixed
   systems with molar ratios of 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3, the efflorescence
   relative humidity (ERH) was measured to be 50.2\%, 59.8\% and 69.3\%,
   respectively. These results suggested that in each of the systems
   studied the addition of amino acids to aerosols could promote the
   crystallization of mixed droplets. However, the higher deliquescence
   relative humidity (DRH) with increased fraction of glycine for the mixed
   NaNO3/glycine (3:1, 79.2\%RH; 1:1, 86.3\%RH; 1:3, 86.5\%RH) also
   indicated that glycine could inhibit the deliquescence phase transition
   of mixed systems. In the case of NaNO3/alanine systems, the DRH for 3:1
   and 1:3 mixed particles was 78.2\% and 82.7\% while no deliquescence
   transition occurred for the 1:1 mixed particles. The hygroscopic
   properties of mixed NaNO3/amino acids droplets were modified due to the
   formed amino acid-NaNO3 complex salts from the interactions of amino
   acids with NaNO3 in aerosols during dehydration process. The
   discrepancies in water content for the mixed NaNO3/amino acids with
   molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:3 between dehydration and hydration processes
   at high RH could be attributed to the crystallization of amino
   acid-NaNO3 complex salts during dehydration and the residual amino
   acids.}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   The objective of this study is to identify potential proteomic
   biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that associate with
   response to PI3K inhibitors which are in clinical trials. We tested a
   panel of TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models for their tumor
   growth response to a pan-PI3K inhibitor, BKM120. Proteomic analyses by
   reverse phase protein array (RPPA) of 182 markers were performed on
   baseline and post short-term treatment PDX samples, to correlate with
   tumor growth response. We identified several baseline and treatment
   induced proteomic biomarkers in association with resistance. These
   results provide important insights for the development of PI3K
   inhibitors in TNBC.
   PI3K pathway activation is frequently observed in triple negative breast
   cancer (TNBC). However, single agent PI3K inhibitors have shown limited
   anti-tumor activity. To investigate biomarkers of response and
   resistance mechanisms, we tested 17 TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
   models representing diverse genomic backgrounds and varying degrees of
   PI3K pathway signaling activities for their tumor growth response to the
   pan-PI3K inhibitor, BKM120. Baseline and post-treatment PDX tumors were
   subjected to reverse phase protein array (RPPA) to identify protein
   markers associated with tumor growth response. While BKM120 consistently
   reduced PI3K pathway activity, as demonstrated by reduced levels of
   phosphorylated AKT, percentage tumor growth inhibition (\%TGI) ranged
   from 35\% in the least sensitive to 84\% in the most sensitive model.
   Several biomarkers showed significant association with resistance,
   including elevated baseline levels of growth factor receptors (EGFR,
   pHER3 Y1197), PI3Kp85 regulatory subunit, anti-apoptotic protein BclXL,
   EMT (Vimentin, MMP9, IntegrinaV), NFKB pathway (IkappaB, RANKL), and
   intracellular signaling molecules including Caveolin, CBP, and KLF4, as
   well as treatment-induced increases in the levels of phosphorylated
   forms of Aurora kinases. Interestingly, increased AKT phosphorylation or
   PTEN loss at baseline were not significantly correlated to \%TGI. These
   results provide important insights into biomarker development for PI3K
   inhibitors in TNBC.}},

Abstract = {{Background We aimed to forecast the number of unidentified and newly
   acquired HIV-infected individuals each year and to estimate the
   effectiveness of government prevention and control programs in China.
   Methods Dynamic and stochastic models were established based on
   officially published data regarding the four main modes of transmission:
   male homosexual sexual behavior, heterosexual sexual behavior, injection
   drug use (IDU) and plasma donation. Finally, we performed sensitivity
   analyses on model parameters.
   Results Nationally, by December 2016, approximately 280 790 individuals
   were estimated to have an unidentified HIV infection, with transmission
   via male homosexual sexual behavior (n = 100 710), heterosexual sexual
   behavior (n = 174 310), IDU (n = 5 620) and plasma donation (n = 150).
   Moreover, 196 970 newly acquired HIV-infected individuals were expected
   in 2016, via male homosexual sexual behavior (n = 78 610), heterosexual
   sexual behavior (n = 116,540), IDU (n = 1820), and plasma donation (n <
   2).
   Conclusions Our results show that HIV transmission via IDU and plasma
   donation has been effectively controlled; transmission via heterosexual
   sexual contact is being somewhat controlled; however, transmission via
   male homosexual sexual contact is not controlled. Hence, China should
   strengthen efforts aimed at control of unsafe sexual behaviors.}},

   with Vitamin C in group I, Vitamin C + Electrolyte in group II and in
   group III Jaggery, 3 days before transport of animal, during winter and
   hot-humid seasons. The goats were selected from LRC, NDRI Karnal and
   were between 10-12 months old. Each group consisted of 25 goats each,
   divided into high (15) and low (10) flocking densities, with an average
   speed of 25 Km/h transported for 8h. During the transportation period,
   all the animals were kept off-feed and deprived of water. Blood samples
   were taken just before transportation, immediately after transportation,
   6hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs and 2 days post transportation from all the three
   groups. The blood samples were further analyzed for the estimation of
   different hormonal parameters (Cortisol, Prolactin, T3, and T4). In all
   the three groups of goats, higher pre transportation values of T4 and T3
   (P<0.05) were observed in both the seasons and in all the density groups
   of goats whereas cortisol and prolactin levels were maximum (P<0.05)
   just after unloading. Supplementation with Vitamin C, Vitamin C +
   Electrolyte and Jaggery aided in reducing transportation stress but
   Vitamin C + Electrolyte combination proved more beneficial in
   alleviating transportation stress in the goats.}},

   ZnO nanoparticles were evaluated for different parameters on day 1, 30
   and 60 after its preparations. The average size of ZnO nanoparticles
   synthesized in this study was in the range of 73-87 nm with a

   Fabricated by High Speed High Pressure Torsion (HSHPT)}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that severe plastic deformation (SPD) has the
   ability to produce ultrafinegrained (UFG) and nanocrystalline materials
   in bulk. Recent developments in high pressure torsion (HPT) processes
   have led to the production of bimetallic composites using copper,
   aluminum or magnesium alloys. This article outlines a new approach to
   fabricate multilayered Ni-Ti nanocomposites by a patented SPD technique,
   namely, high speed high pressure torsion (HSHPT). The multilayered
   composite discs consist of Ni-Ti alloys of different composition: a
   shape memory alloy (SMA) Ti-rich, whose Mf > RT, and an SMA Ni-rich,
   whose Af < RT. The composites were designed to have 2 to 32 layers of
   both alloys. The layers were arranged in different sequences to improve
   the shape recovery on both heating and cooling of nickel-titanium
   alloys. The manufacturing process of Ni-Ti multilayers is explained in
   this work. The evolution of the microstructure was traced using optical,
   scanning electron and transmission electron microscopes. The
   effectiveness of the bonding of the multilayered composites was
   investigated. The shape memory characteristics and the martensitic
   transition of the nickel-titanium nanocomposites were studied by
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This method opens up new
   possibilities for designing various layered metal-matrix composites
   achieving the best combination of shape memory, deformability and
   tensile strength.}},

Journal = {{SPEECH COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{61-68}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder leading to imprecise articulation
   of speech. Acoustic analysis capable of detecting and assessing
   articulation errors is useful in dysarthria diagnosis and therapy. Since
   speakers with dysarthria experience difficulty in producing rhotics due
   to complex articulatory gestures of these sounds, the hypothesis of the
   present study is that duration of the rhotic approximant /a/
   distinguishes dysarthric speech of different severity levels. Duration
   measurements were conducted using the third formant (F3) trajectories
   estimated from quasi-closed-phase (QCP) spectrograms. Results indicate
   that the severity level of spastic dysarthria has a significant effect
   on duration of /a/. In addition, the phonetic context has a significant
   effect on duration of /a/, the t -r-c context showing the largest
   difference in /a/ duration between dysarthric speech of the highest
   severity levels and healthy speech. The results of this preliminary
   study can be used in the future to develop signal processing and machine
   learning methods to automatically predict the severity level of spastic
   dysarthria from speech signals.}},

Abstract = {{Complementary exponential geometric distribution has many applications
   in survival and reliability analysis. Due to its importance, in this
   study, we are aiming to estimate the parameters of this model based on
   progressive type-II censored observations. To do this, we applied the
   stochastic expectation maximization method and Newton-Raphson techniques
   for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates. We also considered the
   estimation based on Bayesian method using several approximate: MCMC
   samples, Lindely approximation and Metropolis-Hasting algorithm. In
   addition, we considered the shrinkage estimators based on Bayesian and
   maximum likelihood estimators. Then, the HPD intervals for the
   parameters are constructed based on the posterior samples from the
   Metropolis-Hasting algorithm. In the sequel, we obtained the performance
   of different estimators in terms of biases, estimated risks and Pitman
   closeness via Monte Carlo simulation study. This paper will be ended up
   with a real data set example for illustration of our purpose.}},

Journal = {{NEOPLASIA}},

Abstract = {{Spontaneously occurring canine oral squamous cell carcinomas (COSCC) are
   viewed as a useful model for human head and neck squamous cell
   carcinomas (HNSCC). To date however, the molecular basis of COSCC
   remains poorly understood. To identify changes pertinent to cancer cells
   in COSCC, we specifically analyzed tumor cells and matched normal
   epithelium from clinical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens
   using laser-capture-microdissection coupled with RNA-sequencing
   (RNAseq). Our results identify strong contributions of
   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), classical tumor-promoting
   (such as E2F, KRAS, MYC, mTORC1, and TGFB1 signaling) and immune-related
   pathways in the tumor epithelium of COSCC. Comparative analyses of COSCC
   with 43 paired tumor/normal HNSCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed
   a high homology in transcriptional reprogramming, and identified
   processes associated with cell cycle progression, immune processes, and
   loss of cellular differentiation as likely central drivers of the
   disease. Similar to HNSCC, our analyses suggested a ZEB2-driven partial
   EMT in COSCC and identified selective upregulation of KRT14 and KRT17 in
   COSCC. Beyond homology in transcriptional signatures, we also found
   therapeutic vulnerabilities strongly conserved between the species:
   these included increased expression of PD-L1 and CTLA-4, coinciding with
   EMT and revealing the potential for immune checkpoint therapies, and
   overexpression of CDK4/6 that sensitized COSCC to treatment with
   palbociclib. In summary, our data significantly extend the current
   knowledge of molecular aberrations in COSCC and underline the potential
   of spontaneous COSCC as a model for HNSCC to interrogate therapeutic
   vulnerabilities and support translation of novel therapies from bench to
   bedside.}},

Abstract = {{Edible films and coatings have been applied on fruits to improve their
   quality during growth and development as well as during postharvest
   storage. A response surface methodology was used to determine the
   effects of oil concentration, number of passes and calcium chloride
   concentration on the physical, mechanical and transport properties of
   oil-alginate composite films. Alginate-based films were developed using
   alginate (1.0\% w/v), soybean oil (0.5\%, 1.0\% and 1.5\% v/v) and Tween
   80 (R) (1\% v/v). Coarse emulsions were passed 2, 4 and 6 times through
   a microfluidizer at 200 MPa. Calcium chloride solutions (0\%, 1.5\% and
   3\%) were then applied on the cast films to crosslink them. The oil
   particle sizes ranged from 360 to 445 nm, regardless of the emulsion
   composition and number of passes. The lowest water permeability value
   (1.8857E-10 g/msPa) was obtained for 1.5\% oil concentration, 6 passes
   and no crosslinking. The porosity of the films at low oil concentrations
   increased with an increase in crosslinking level. In comparison, the
   porosity of the films at high oil concentrations decreased with an
   increase in crosslinking level. Emulsified films showed reduced strength
   and increased elongation with an increase in oil concentration. Films
   treated with calcium chloride showed lower strength due to greater
   effects from oil than calcium chloride. In conclusion, oil incorporation
   in films was the predominant factor in improved film properties,
   especially for water vapor permeability.}},

   Approach}},
Journal = {{AGRONOMY-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the relationship between wheat trading countries
   using both descriptive and statistical inference methods for complex
   networks. The global Wheat Trade Network (WTN) and its evolving
   topological characteristics is analysed for the periods 2009-2013 and
   2014-2018, using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data. The
   network characterisation measures in both periods are rather stable.
   There are some differences, however, in the magnitude of some measures
   (e.g., connectivity or disassortativity), and a higher degree of
   inequality in the distribution of the number of partners and the
   distribution of trade volume in the period 2014-2018. An Exponential
   Random Graph Model (ERGM) has been applied to identify significant
   determinants associated with the presence/absence of trade links between
   countries. The results indicate that wheat trade links are driven mainly
   by country openness, reciprocity (mutual importer-exporter
   relationship), whether the exporting country is US or Canada and the
   geographical location of importer and exporter. Other factors, such as
   the economic size of the importing country, if the importing country is
   US or Canada and the land surface of the exporting country also
   contribute less to capture interlinkages of WTN.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to show how Ortega y Gasset proposes a vocational,
   heroic and sportive ethic against, on the one hand, Kant's abstract and
   universalist idealism and, on the other hand, against the ethical
   nihilism of the era of the masses, which ends in utilitarian positivism
   and disorientation. This orteguian ethics also presents a mundane
   humanist character, far removed from all transcendentalism, and founded
   on the self-clarification of the subject. In this way, the subject can
   be lord and master of oneself to freely govern his existence and direct
   it toward the realization of the self. According to Ortega y Gasset, to
   hear vocation that calls us to be ourselves is what characterizes the
   moral subject, that is, the moral hero. `To become oneself' is the
   concept that Ortega y Gasset proposes to fill the gap left by God's
   death announced by Nietzsche in the European soul.}},

   could be dated to the beginning of the 18th century, and analyses of the

   the lives of those people.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the Caregiving Questionnaire (CQ) being a widely used measure
   for the study of caregiving behavior in the context of romantic
   relationships, to date, few studies have focused on empirically
   evaluating its underlying theoretical structure. The aim of this study
   was to examine the factorial structure and equivalence across sex and
   sexual orientation of this instrument. A sample of 912 Chilean
   individuals currently involved in a couple relationship completed the
   Caregiving Questionnaire and the Experiences in Close Relationship
   Scale. After comparing various traditional Confirmatory Factor Analysis
   (CFA)models, the results provide support for a multidimensional and
   hierarchical nature of a brief 16-items version of the CQ. More
   specifically, the analyses supported a bifactor-CFA solution composed of
   two global factors and four specific factors, suggesting that they add
   information to the caregiving construct in the context of couple
   relationships. Additionally, the scale showed measurement invariance
   across sex and sexual orientation. Finally, significant associations
   were found between CQ scores with measures of romantic attachment in the
   expected directions. Theoretical implications about the nature of the
   caregiving system are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory complex I (NADH:quinone oxidoreductase) plays a central role
   in generating the proton electrochemical gradient in mitochondrial and
   bacterial membranes, which is needed to generate ATP. Several
   high-resolution structures of complex I have been determined, revealing
   its intricate architecture and complementing the biochemical and
   biophysical studies. However, the molecular mechanism of long-range
   coupling between ubiquinone (Q) reduction and proton pumping is not
   known. Computer simulations have been applied to decipher the dynamics
   of Q molecule in the similar to 30 angstrom long Q tunnel. In this short
   report, we discuss the binding and dynamics of Q at computationally
   predicted Q binding sites, many of which are supported by structural
   data on complex I. We suggest that the binding of Q at these sites is
   coupled to proton pumping by means of conformational rearrangements in
   the conserved loops of core subunits.}},

Title = {{Spaceship earth's odyssey to a circular economy - a century long
   perspective}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{163}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The circular economy is a rapidly emerging concept promoted as
   transformative approach towards sustainable resource use within
   Planetary Boundaries. It is gaining traction with policymakers, industry
   and academia worldwide. It promises to slow, narrow and close
   socioeconomic material cycles by retaining value as long as possible,
   thereby minimizing primary resource use, waste and emissions.
   Herein, we utilize a sociometabolic systems approach to investigate the
   global economy as embedded into a materially closed ``spaceship
   earth{''} and to scrutinize the development of circularity during
   industrialization. We quantify primary material and energy inputs into
   the economy, as well as all outputs to the environment from 1900-2015.
   The assessment includes two fundamental cycles: a socioeconomic cycle of
   secondary materials from end-of-life waste and an ecological cycle in
   which resulting waste and emissions are assessed against regenerative
   capacities of biogeochemical systems. In a first approximation, we
   consider only the carbon-neutral fraction of biomass as renewable. We
   find that from 1900-2015, socioeconomic and ecological input cycling
   rates decreased from 43\% (41-51\%) to 27\% (25-30\%), while
   non-circular inputs increased 16-fold and non-circular outputs 10-fold.
   The contribution of ecological cycling to circularity declined from 91\%
   to 76\%.
   We conclude that realizing the transformative potential of the circular
   economy necessitates addressing four key challenges by research and
   policy: tackling the growth of material stocks, defining clear criteria
   for ecological cycling and eliminating unsustainable biomass production,
   integrating the decarbonization of the energy system with the circular
   economy and prioritizing absolute reductions of non-circular flows over
   maximizing (re) cyclingrates.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports from a project introducing a virtual reality
   simulator with patient-specific input for endovascular aneurysm repair
   (EVAR) into a surgical environment at a university hospital in Norway
   during 2016-2019. The project includes acquisition of the simulator,
   training of personnel, and a mapping of the effects. We followed the
   process, adopting ethnographic methods including participation in the
   operating room, simulated patient-specific rehearsals, preparations of
   the rehearsals, meetings with the simulator company, scientific meetings
   and scientific work related to the clinical trials (the second author
   led the clinical trial), in addition to open-ended interviews with
   vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists. We used the concepts
   of boundary work and sensework as conceptual lenses through which we
   studied the introduction of the simulator and how it influenced the
   nature of work and the professional relationship between the vascular
   surgeons and the interventional radiologists. We found that the
   simulator facilitated professional integration, at the same time as it
   served as a material resource for professional identity development.
   This study is the first to our knowledge that investigates the role of
   simulators for professional identity and relationship among surgeons and
   radiologists. Further studies of simulators in similar and different
   social contexts may contribute to deeper and more generic understanding
   of the way simulators influence our working life.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoporous silica MCM-41 was synthesized hydrothermally and then
   impregnated by different transition metals (such as Cr, Cu, Fe and Zn).
   The modified materials in calcined and non-calcined forms were tested in
   the adsorption of OG and MB dyes in single and binary system. Effect of
   calcination, contact time, initial dye concentration and adsorbent mass
   were studied. Two kinetics models were applied the first and the second
   order kinetics as well as the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms were
   tested. The obtained samples were also used as anti-bacterial and
   anti-fungal agents using gram negative (P.aeruginos and E coli), gram
   positive (B. cereus, and S. aureus) pathogenic clinical bacteria and
   pathogenic fungi (Candida albicans). The result confirms that the
   adsorption process of both dyes follows second-order kinetics and their
   equilibrium data were fitted well to the linear Langmuir model. The
   maximum adsorption capacity of OG and MB dyes was 200 mg/g and 166 mg/g
   for non-calcined and calcined Zn/MCM-41, respectively. The adsorption of
   a binary mixture showed that the both materials are selective. The best
   selectivity was obtained by non-calcined Zn/MCM-41 wherein the OG dye
   was predominantly adsorbed. The application of all samples as
   anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agents showed encouraging results, but
   the best results were obtained by non-calcined materials, particularly
   with Cu/MCM-41 and Zn/MCM-41.}},

Abstract = {{Background We investigated the effect of preoperative renal dysfunction
   on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing elective isolated total
   arch replacement (TAR) with mild hypothermic lower body circulatory
   arrest with antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (SCP).
   Methods One hundred and forty-four patients who had undergone elective
   isolated TAR between January 2002 and December 2019 were retrospectively
   analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether
   their preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower
   than or higher than 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). We compared perioperative data
   and mid-term outcomes after adjusting for patients' baseline
   characteristics using weighted logistic regression analysis and inverse
   probability of treatment weighting.
   Results More patients underwent postoperative stroke in the chronic
   kidney disease group compared with the normal group (2.8\% vs. 0\%,
   respectively; p = .049). Overall 30-day mortality and hospital mortality
   were 0\% in both groups, and there was no significant difference in
   overall survival between the two groups (log-rank test, p = .129).
   Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that eGFR < 60
   ml/min/1.73 m(2) was not an independent predictor (hazard ratio: 1.636,
   95\% confidence interval 0.829-3.231; p = .156).
   Conclusions Preoperative eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) was not associated
   with worse outcomes after elective isolated TAR with mild hypothermic
   lower body circulatory arrest with antegrade SCP.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel Deep Learning architecture to assist with
   steering a powered wheelchair. A rule-based approach is utilized to
   train and test a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network. It is the
   first time a LSTM has been used for steering a powered wheelchair. A
   disabled driver uses a joystick to provide desired speed and direction,
   and the Neural Network provides a safe direction for the wheelchair.
   Results from the Neural Network are mixed with desired speed and
   direction to avoid obstacles. Inputs originate from a joystick and from
   three ultrasonic transducers attached to the chair. The resultant course
   is a blend of desired directions and directions that steer the chair to
   avoid collision. A rule-based approach is used to create a training and
   test set for the Neural Network system and applies deep learning to
   predict a safe route for a wheelchair. The user can over-ride the new
   system if necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study examines the relations between a regular weekday
   bedtime with weight status, diet quality, physical activity, wellbeing,
   and parental rules among children 2 to 12 years of age from low-income
   populations.
   Methods: The study used baseline data collected in 2012, as part of a
   larger quasiexperimental study design. A convenience sample of parents
   of children in preschools, second, or fifth grade attending Head Start
   centers or elementary schools located in low-income catchment areas, in
   Houston and Austin, TX, were recruited to participate in the study (n =
   32 elementary schools; n = 12 Head Start centers). Regular weekday
   bedtime was measured with the question ``Does your child have a regular
   weekday bedtime?{''}
   Results: The sample of 1467 child-parent dyads were split approximately
   evenly by sex, and consisted of 44.4\% Pre-K, 30.4\% second grade, and
   25.2\% fifth grade students. Six hundred twenty-two (43.6\%) children
   were overweight or obese. Children who had a regular bedtime had 15\%
   lower odds of being overweight or obese (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR]:
   0.85, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.74-0.97, p-value: 0.017). Also,
   children who had a regular bedtime had 45\% higher odds of eating the
   recommended number of fruits and vegetables (aOR: 1.45, 95\% CI:
   1.02-2.07, p-value: 0.039) and had physical activity more days of the
   week (beta: 0.42, 95\% CI: 0.26-0.57, p-value: <0.001).
   Conclusions: Having a regular weekday bedtime is associated with better
   weight status and several obesity-related health behaviors in children.
   Parental report of regular bedtimes for their children may be an
   indication of parenting skills related to other health-related behaviors
   for prevention of childhood obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Ahwaz sandstone and Kalhur evaporate members are two main constituents
   of the best reservoir unit of Zagros region, i.e. Asmari Formation.
   Poorly cemented to loose nature of the sandstone member and it's well
   textural maturity generate highly porous and permeable zones, whereas
   highly compacted nature of the evaporate member provide impermeable
   zones in the reservoirs. This paper aims to study the lithological
   characteristics of these members and their lateral and vertical
   distribution in two main zones of the Zagros, i.e. Dezful Embayment and
   Abadan Plain. The results are believed to provide significant
   information on discovery of the stratigraphic traps in the area.
   Inclusive results from similar to 200 drilled wells of 68 oilfields are
   used in this study. The established isopach, and isolith maps and
   correlation charts provide a good basis for locating the probable
   stratigrphic traps in the area. The sandstone member is well developed
   in central part of the northern Dezful Embayment (e.g. Ahwaz and
   Abe-Teymur fields) and Abadan Plain (Jufair, Kushk, Darquin, Azadegan
   and Omid fields). It is poorly developed in the southern Dezful
   Embayment, except for its NW (Aghajar, Kranj, Rag-e-Sefied, Tangu and
   Zagheh fields). Based on its distribution pattern in the area, the
   bordering fields around the central part of the northern Dezful
   Embayment and Abadan Plain are found more susceptible for development of
   the stratigraphic traps. The evaporate member is well developed in NW of
   the northern Dezful Embayment but is absent in southern Dezful
   Embayment, except Parsi and Karanj fields. Based on its distribution
   pattern in the studied area, the NW bordering fields between northern
   and southern Dezful Embayment have greater potential for stratigraphic
   traps development. Based on the outcomes of this study, the facies
   changes that resulted from Zagros folding and faulting and simultaneous
   basement fault movements seems the main causes for development of the
   combination traps.}},

Abstract = {{The distorted membrane asymmetry and abnormal distribution of
   phospholipids viz., phosphatidylserine (PS), and
   phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the outer leaflet are critical features
   of cancer. In the present study, the blood protein spectrin (SPN) was
   used as a ligand due to it PS-binding affinity and drug nisin was used
   because it disrupts and fluidized the plasma membrane. Polymeric poly
   lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared and
   optimized by the Response surface Box Behnken randomized model using
   various independent and dependent variables. The optimized-nanoparticles
   (NNP2) were further conjugated with SPN, and conjugation was confirmed
   by infrared spectroscopy, and in silico docking, the analysis was also
   conducted for the ligand-polymer interactions. Both nanoparticulate
   formulations were further characterized for mean particle size, drug
   entrapment, zeta potential, surface morphology, and in vitro drug
   release and kinetic study. The results indicated that the prepared
   formulations were in spherical, nano-metric size with -ve zeta
   potential. More than 64\% drug entrapment with 85\% drug released after
   72 h were found in both types of formulations. In vitro cytotoxicity
   study was performed by sulforhodamine blue assay on MDA-MB-231 (breast
   cancer), and FR-2 (normal breast epithelial) cell lines and results
   showed the IC50 of unconjugated and SPN-conjugated nanoparticles 13.0 mu
   g/mL and 0.06 mu g/mL, respectively on MDA-MB-231 whereas 276.11 mu g/mL
   and 142.99 mu g/mL on FR-2. Briefly, results suggest that the developed
   nanoparticles could be used for better cancer treatment without any
   harmful effects on adjacent normal cells.}},

Title = {{Helminth infections among rural schoolchildren in Southern Ethiopia: A
   cross-sectional multilevel and zero-inflated regression model}},

Abstract = {{Author summary
   Helminth infections are common among school-aged children in Ethiopia.
   Several cross-sectional studies have investigated the risk factors of
   these helminths infection. However, most were conducted in an urban
   setting in Northern Ethiopia. Many of these studies did not report the
   intensity of helminth infections; and they restricted helminths
   infection data to binary outcomes. There has been limited report related
   to zero-inflated model for helminths count data with excess zeros and
   over-dispersion. Multilevel analysis for nested structure of school data
   has also been rarely applied. Therefore, we aimed to assess the
   prevalence and intensity of helminths infection and the related
   individual-, household-, and school-level risk factors among rural
   schoolchildren in Southern Ethiopia. Using count model, we modelled the
   risk factors of helminths egg. Using a multivariate, multilevel,
   mixed-effect, logistic regression model, we found minimal variation
   across class- and school-level factors for helminths infection
   prevalence. We found associations between helminths infection and most
   individual-, and some household-level factors. Therefore, interventions
   focusing on the individual, household, and school should be implemented
   to reduce the prevalence of infection and worm load among
   schoolchildren.
   Although the prevalence of helminths infection among schoolchildren is
   known, there has been little progress in the application of count model
   for modelling the risk factors of helminths egg. Only a few studies
   applied multilevel analysis to explore the variation in helminths
   prevalence across schools and classes. This study aimed to assess the
   prevalence, intensity of helminths infection, and identify risk factors
   at the individual-, household-, and school-level among schoolchildren in
   Southern Ethiopia. Using multistage random sampling, we recruited 864
   students in the Wonago District. We applied multilevel-logistic and
   zero-inflated negative binomial regression models (ZINB). Risk factors
   were concentrated at the individual level; school-level and class-level
   variables explained less than 5\% of the variance. The overall helminths
   prevalence was 56\% (479/850); Trichuris trichiura prevalence was 42.4\%
   (360/850); and Ascaris lumbricoides prevalence was 18.7\% (159/850). The
   rate of any helminths increased among thin children (AOR: 1.73 {[}95\%
   CI: (1.04, 2.90]), anemic (AOR: 1.45 {[}95\% CI: 1.04, 2.03]), mothers
   who had no formal education (AOR: 2.08 {[}95\% CI: 1.25, 3.47]), and
   those in households using open containers for water storage (AOR: 2.06
   {[}95\% CI: 1.07, 3.99]). In the ZINB model, A. lumbricoides infection
   intensity increased with increasing age (AOR: 1.08 {[}95\% CI: 1.01,
   1.16]) and unclean fingernails (AOR: 1.47 {[}95\% CI: 1.07, 2.03]).
   Handwashing with soap (AOR: 0.68 {[}95\% CI: 0.48, 0.95]), de-worming
   treatment {[}AOR: 0.57 (95\% CI: 0.33, 0.98)], and using water from
   protected sources {[}AOR: 0.46 (95\% CI: 0.28, 0.77)] were found to be
   protective against helminths infection. After controlling for clustering
   effects at the school and class levels and accounting for excess zeros
   in fecal egg counts, we found an association between helminths infection
   and the following variables: age, thinness, anemia, unclean fingernails,
   handwashing, de-worming treatment, mother's education, household water
   source, and water storage protection. Improving hygiene behavior,
   providing safe water at school and home, and strengthening de-worming
   programs is required to improve the health of schoolchildren in rural
   Gedeo.}},

Abstract = {{Over 70\% of breast cancers express the estrogen receptor (ER) and
   depend on ER activity for survival and proliferation. While hormone
   therapies that target receptor activity are initially effective,
   patients invariably develop resistance which is often associated with
   activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target
   of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. While the mechanism by which estrogen
   regulates proliferation is not fully understood, one gene target of ER,
   growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1), is required
   for hormone-dependent proliferation. However, the molecular function by
   which GREB1 regulates proliferation is unknown. Herein, we validate that
   knockdown of GREB1 results in growth arrest and that exogenous GREB1
   expression initiates senescence, suggesting that an optimal level of
   GREB1 expression is necessary for proliferation of breast cancer cells.
   Under both of these conditions, GREB1 is able to regulate signaling
   through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. GREB1 acts intrinsically through PI3K
   to regulate phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate levels and Akt
   activity. Critically, growth suppression of estrogen-dependent breast
   cancer cells by GREB1 knockdown is rescued by expression of
   constitutively activated Akt. Together, these data identify a novel
   molecular function by which GREB1 regulates breast cancer proliferation
   through Akt activation and provides a mechanistic link between estrogen
   signaling and the PI3K pathway.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the question of the institutional promotion of
   Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI) in South Africa, arguing for
   formal, systematic CCI clusters. Firstly, it examines the revived
   international emphasis on industrial clusters in economic and industrial
   development strategies. The paper suggests that the growing interest in
   cluster approaches is linked, in part, to the increased acknowledgement
   of institutional and social factors in new economic and planning theory
   and policy. Secondly, the more specific application of such cluster
   approaches to the CCIs and the creative economy is inspected. This
   includes the integration of CCI clusters within smart specialization and
   place-based approaches to economic and industrial development. Thirdly,
   the paper examines the case for formal CCI cluster interventions in
   South Africa. The uneven, and predominantly technical application of
   industrial cluster analysis and policy in the post-1994 era is analysed.
   The need for systematic incorporation of industrial clusters in
   contemporary South African industrial policy is considered. The merits
   of the case for the establishment of formal CCI clusters are then
   examined alongside select CCI clustering trends. While CCI clustering
   appears to have increased in recent years, these developments tend to be
   more organic and/or modest with little articulation within policy and
   institutional structures. Finally, the paper outlines potential policy
   measures. A formal CCI cluster initiative is proposed, on a multi-agency
   and public-private partnership basis, with the South African Departments
   of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) and of Sports, Arts and
   Culture (DSCAC as central players. The initiative will look to reinforce
   the international trade and leverage existing and new incentives.}},

   and water contact angle compared to unloaded PCLs (P < 0.05). The
   treatment with PCLs loaded with mupirocin, CS, and GO significantly
   reduced wound area and total bacterial count (P < 0.05). Loading PCLs
   with mupirocin, CS, and GO decreased the expressions of IL-1 beta,
   TNF-alpha, MMP-9, but increased the expressions of IL-10 and VEGF

Journal = {{NUCLEAR MATERIALS AND ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we report experimental and numerical investigations of
   gross and net erosion of gold (Au) and molybdenum (Mo), proxies for the
   common plasma-facing material tungsten (W), during L-mode plasma
   discharges in deuterium (D) in the outer strike-point region of the
   ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. To this end, erosion profiles of different marker
   spots (for Au, dimensions 1 x 1 and 5 x 5 mm(2)) and marker coatings
   (for Mo) have been determined and modelled using the ERO code. The
   smaller marker spots were designed to quantify the gross-erosion rate
   while on the bigger markers local prompt re-deposition of Au allowed
   obtaining data on net erosion.
   The experimental results indicate relatively uniform erosion profiles
   across the marker spots or coatings, very little re-deposition
   elsewhere, and the largest erosion taking place close to the strike
   point. Compared to W, the markers show up to 15 times higher net erosion
   but no major differences in the poloidal migration lengths of Au and W
   can be seen. Gold thus appears to be a proper choice for studying
   migration of W in the divertor region.
   The ERO simulations with different background plasmas are able to
   reproduce the main features of the experimental net erosion profile of
   Au. Of the studied parameters, electron temperature has the strongest
   impact on erosion: doubling the temperature enhances erosion by a factor
   of 2.5-3. In contrast, for Mo, the simulated net erosion is similar to 3
   times smaller than what experimental data indicate. The discrepancies
   can be attributed to the deviations of the background plasma profiles
   from the measured ones as well as to the applied models or
   approximations for the ion temperature, plasma potential, and sheath
   characteristics in ERO. In addition, the surrounding areas of the marker
   samples being covered with impurities and W from previous experiments
   may have considerably reduced the actual re-deposition of Mo.
   All the simulations predict a toroidal tail of re-deposited particles,
   downstream of the markers, but the particle density seems to be below
   the experimental detection threshold. The comparison between the 1 x 1
   mm(2) and 5 x 5 mm(2) marker spots further reveal that re-deposition
   drops from >50\% to <40\% when decreasing the marker size. This
   indicates that small enough marker samples can be used for accurately
   determining gross erosion in ASDEX Upgrade.}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy and nivolumab + ipilimumab are approved
   first-line treatment options for patients with metastatic stage IV NSCLC

   consistent with results in the overall PD-L1 TPS >= 1\% population. This
   study provides important results to inform clinical decision making
   given the lack of head-to-head studies comparing pembrolizumab +
   chemotherapy and nivolumab + ipilimumab.
   Background: In the absence of head-to-head trials, this study indirectly
   compared the effectiveness of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs nivolumab
   + ipilimumab for the first-line treatment of metastatic stage IV NSCLC
   patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) >= 1\%. Methods: An
   anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted
   using pooled individual patient data (IPD) from the ITT population in
   KEYNOTE-021G, KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 (n = 816) and published
   aggregate data of nivolumab + ipilimumab from CheckMate 227 Part 1A (n =
   793). To adjust for cross-trial differences in baseline characteristics,
   data from KEYNOTE-021G/KEYNOTE-189/KEYNOTE-407 were re-weighted to match
   the baseline characteristics of CheckMate 227 Part 1A. Outcomes included
   OS, PFS and ORR. Base case analyses were restricted to patients with
   PD-L1 TPS >= 1\%, with sub-group analyses in PD-L1 TPS >= 50\% and
   1-49\%. Results: The estimated HR (95\% CI) of pembrolizumab +
   chemotherapy vs nivolumab + ipilimumab was 0.80 (0.59,1.09) and 0.53
   (0.41,0.68) for OS and PFS, respectively. For ORR, the estimated risk
   ratio was 1.8 (1.3,2.4) for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs nivolumab +
   ipilimumab and the risk difference was 25.5\% (15.0,36.0). PD-L1 TPS >=
   50\% and 1-49\% sub-groups showed an OS HR of 0.89 (0.58,1.36) and 0.68
   (0.46,1.01), respectively. Conclusion: These MAIC results suggest that
   pembrolizumab + chemotherapy leads to a greater clinical benefit vs
   nivolumab + ipilimumab in patients with PD-L1 TPS >= 1\% across multiple
   endpoints.}},

Abstract = {{The Terminal Classic period (ca. AD 800-1000) in the Southern Maya
   Lowlands witnessed a precipitous decline in the erection of carved stone
   monuments, a decline that corresponds to shifts in political ideologies
   and the disappearance of many prominent royal dynasties. Although
   Southern Lowland sites are often considered peripheral to the events and
   innovations occurring elsewhere in Mesoamerica during this time, a
   recently discovered stela, Stela 29, at the site of Ucanal in Peten,
   Guatemala, underscores the active role of the site in broader political
   movements in the ninth century. Our iconographic, textual, and stylistic
   analysis of this stela, in concert with other Terminal Classic monuments
   from the site, reveals a vernacular cosmopolitan aesthetic whereby local
   Classic Maya styles were infused with images and elements that
   referenced connections with peoples from northern Yucatan, the Gulf
   Coast, and Central Mexico.}},

Journal = {{OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{476}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{A broad survey is taken to assess the agility of the cesium 62D states
   in the generation of cascade lasing from 455 to 3650 nm. The experiment
   utilized a heat pipe with 0 to 10 Torr of He, cesium densities of 10(14)
   to 10(17) atoms per cm(3), and it is pumped by a pulsed dye laser with 1
   to 30 mJ/pulse. Cascade lasing, generated by amplified spontaneous
   emission with no aid of a cavity, is observed on over 17 transitions-
   nearly every dipole allowed transition from energy levels below 62D.
   Many lasing lines possess 100 to 229 mu J of energy, slope efficiencies
   of 4 to 7\%, low thresholds favorable for diode pumping, and together
   have combined optical conversion efficiencies as high as 10\% +/- 3\%.
   This agile system could have applications in infrared counter measures,
   target illuminator lasers, beacon lasers, underwater communication, and
   other tactical laser applications.}},

Abstract = {{In the current study, a novel series of Schiff base derivatives of

   e (3a-3f) and
   (E)-4-(benzylideneamino)-N-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)benzenesulfonamide
   (3g-3q) were synthesize. The structures of synthetic compounds were
   elucidated by various spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR, NMR and
   spectrometric HRMS analysis. Synthetic derivatives were evaluated for
   their Jack Bean urease inhibitory activity using established in-vitro
   assay. It is worth mentioning here that most of our derivatives of both
   series displayed moderate to strong inhibitory activity, ranging between
   IC50 = 2.48 +/- 0.78 mu M and 35.63 +/- 1.26 mu M, as compared to
   standard thiourea (IC50 = 20.03 +/- 2.03 mu M). Further, structure
   activity relationship studies suggest that the presence of halogen at
   ortho and para positions on the aryl ring in
   (E)-4-(benzylideneamino)-N-(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamid
   e derivatives and hydroxy and halogen in
   (E)-4-(benzylideneamino)-N-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)benzenesulfonamide
   derivatives increased the urease inhibitory activity. Furthermore,
   molecular docking studies were carried out in order to investigate the
   binding mode of this class of compounds to urease. In order to evaluate
   drug likeness of compounds ADME evaluation was done, and the synthesized
   compounds were found to be non-toxic and present passive
   gastrointestinal absorption. The data suggests the synthesized
   sulphamethazine and sulphamethoxazole derivatives can serve as a novel
   scaffold to inhibit urease.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebellum plays an important role in several key functions including
   control of movement, balance, cognition, reward, and affect. Imaging
   studies indicate that distinct cerebellar regions contribute to these
   different functions. Molecular studies examining regional cerebellar
   differences are lagging as they are mostly done on whole cerebellar
   extracts thereby masking any distinctions across specific cerebellar
   regions. Here we describe a technique to reproducibly and quickly
   dissect four different cerebellar regions: the deep cerebellar nuclei
   (DCN), anterior and posterior vermal cerebellar cortex, and the
   cerebellar cortex of the hemispheres. Dissecting out these distinct
   regions allows for the exploration of molecular mechanisms that may
   underlie their unique contributions to balance, movement, affect and
   cognition. This technique may also be used to explore differences in
   pathological susceptibility of these specific regions across various
   mouse disease models.}},

Abstract = {{In this multidisciplinary and conceptual paper, we use insights from new
   and challenging developments in the management and marketing literature
   to inform corporate governance research. We shed light on the role of
   governance and specifically boards of directors in value creation in
   small and medium enterprises. While corporate governance research mostly
   tends to emphasise the role of governance mechanisms such as boards in
   the protection and distribution of value, our research problematises
   such a narrow view and (re)conceptualises their role in value
   co-creation. By exploring the role of boards as resource integrators
   within a wider service ecosystem, we propose novel ways in which boards
   can become integral to firms' value creation processes. In doing so, we
   develop a new logic for framing the boards' tasks and suggest new
   directions for corporate governance research and practice. We apply an
   empirical conceptualisation strategy in order to make our findings more
   accessible. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   their use of the courts formed part of a larger pattern of post-war
   conflict resolution. This was a time when people in France endured
   decades of warfare and confessional division, but nevertheless emerged
   determined to put an end to the violence by committing to resolve their

Abstract = {{Introduction. -The main problem in obesity management is weight regain
   that occurs after all currently used slimming procedures. Regular
   physical activity remains the most effective measure to stop this weight
   regain. Among the varieties of training that can be offered, endurance
   exercise at low to moderate intensities targeted at the level of maximum
   lipid oxidation (LIPOX max) is one of the easiest to implement and has
   well-documented effects on glucose metabolism, blood lipids, eating
   behavior, and body composition. Our purpose in this study was to study
   the effect of this type of exercise on body composition over 2 years.
   Methods. - Nonrandomized controlled longitudinal study. Forty-five obese
   subjects (14 men, 31 women, age =20-85 years old) were re-trained with
   LIPOXmax (3 x 45 min/week at home with regular follow-up after induction
   in hospital) over 2 years. They were compared to a matched control group
   of 26 subjects. Exercise calorimetry and segmental bioelectric impedance
   were performed at the beginning and at the 24th month.
   Results. - Trained group lost weight (- 6 +/- 1.44 kg) over 2 years.
   This is explained by a loss of fat mass (- 5 +/- 1.26 kg), affecting
   truncal fat mass (- 2.66 +/- 0.62 kg P< 0.0001), and appendicular fat
   mass (1.38 +/- 0.72 kg P< 0.01). There is also a reduction in lean body
   mass (- 2.41 +/- 0.86 kg, P< 0.01). Controls gain 3 +/- 0.85 kg (P<
   0.001). In the trained group, the ability to oxidize lipids increased
   (P< 0.001) and there was a positive correlation between weight changes
   and mean arterial blood pressure at 24 months (R=0.37 P= 0.02).
   Conclusion. -The weight loss effectiveness of endurance training
   targeted at the LIPOXmax is maintained for 24 months. This weight loss
   affects both trunk and appendicular fat mass but also lean mass. It
   associated with a decrease in blood pressure and an improvement in the
   ability to oxidize lipids during exercise. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a comparative study of benzoid
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as
   electrode and as hole carrier transport layer (HTL) in the manufacture
   of organic photovoltaic devices using Fischer metal-carbene complexes.
   The performance of the different devices was evaluated for solar cell
   applications. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) were used to characterize the thin films that integrated the
   devices. A more ordered and crystallized active film microstructure is
   observed when using benzoid PEDOT:PSS as nucleation layer. The optical
   gap for both direct and indirect electronic transitions was evaluated
   from ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy data (UV-vis), as well as the
   absorption coefficient (alpha), and the values are in the range of
   2.10-2.93 eV. Photovoltaic devices with conventional architecture, using
   two different chromium carbenes as active layers, were manufactured, and
   their electrical behavior was studied. The devices were irradiated with
   different wavelengths between the infrared and ultraviolet regions of
   the electromagnetic spectrum. Using the PEDOT:PSS film as hole carrier
   transport layer (HTL) decreases the slope on the ohmic and space charge
   limited current (SCLC) regions and eliminates the trap-charge limited
   current (T-CLC) mechanism. Furthermore, a saturation current of similar
   to 1.95 x 10(-10) A and higher current values similar to 1.75 x 10(-2) A
   at 4 V, similar to 4 orders in magnitude larger were observed. The
   PEDOT:PSS films as HTL in the devices reduced the injection barrier,
   thus showing a better performance than as anodes in this type of organic
   solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{Pulp is a major part of persimmon fruit, for which it is widely
   cultivated in different parts of the world. Persimmon seeds are
   generally discarded as waste. The objective of the present work was to
   investigate the nutritional, antioxidative, and pharmacological
   properties of the seeds of three persimmon cultivars namely Jinyeong
   (JYS), Yangyangdongchulsi (YYS), and Hamanmulgam (HAS). JYS (9417.87
   mg.kg(-1)) contained the highest concentration of total minerals,
   followed by HAS and YYS. The concentration of total organic acids was
   also the highest in JYS (5362.43 mg.kg(-1)), while the lowest in HAS
   (4411.1 mg.kg(-1)). Similarly, JYS and YYS contained the highest and
   lowest concentrations of free sugars, respectively. On the other hand,
   the total free amino acid contents were the highest in YYS (336.34
   mg.100 g(-1)) among the cultivars. The persimmon seeds also have good
   potential for scavenging free radicals and inhibiting
   acetylcholinesterase activity. The seeds could also be considered to be
   a source of a therapeutic agent against Alzheimer's disease, as the seed
   extract showed promising anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. The overall
   results of the present work provide an insight into persimmon seeds, a
   by-product of persimmon fruit, as a potential product in the
   pharmaceutical and food industries. (C) All Rights Reserved}},

   fabricated in situ via selective laser melting of Ti and B4C powders}},
Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{36}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Titanium matrix composites reinforced with titanium boride (TiB) and
   titanium carbide (TiC) were fabricated in situ via selective laser
   melting (SLM). Varying contents of boron carbide (B4C) from 0 to 5 wt\%
   were added to pure Ti to prepare blended powders for SLM. The influence
   of the B4C content on the printability, microstructure and mechanical
   properties of SLM-printed (TiB + TiC)/Ti composites was studied. The
   relative densities of all the fabricated composites were greater than
   97.8 \%; an increase in the B4C content resulted in a decrease in their
   relative density. The microstructure of the composites varied from a
   lath-shaped structure (0 wt\%) to a dendritic structure (1 wt\%) and to
   a cellular + dendritic structure (2-5 wt\%), which was determined by the
   change of thermal convection within melt pools. Both the dendritic and
   cellular structures were arranged by coalescent clusters composed of TiB
   whiskers and TiC particles, while the clusters were formed through a
   self-joining behavior of the TiB whiskers that were mechanically locked
   with the TiC particles. The composites with the addition of 1 wt \% B4C
   exhibited the highest ultimate tensile strength of 946 MPa, yield
   strength of 762 MPa and elastic modulus of 128 GPa, which were 62.4 \%,
   49.2 \% and 15.3 \% higher than those of the Ti matrix, respectively.
   The remarkable enhancement in the mechanical strengths was attributed to
   the synergistic effect of dispersion strengthening and grain refinement
   strengthening. The (TiB + TiC)/Ti composites fabricated in situ by SLM
   with an optimized material formulation not only ensured comparable
   mechanical properties to those of their counterparts manufactured by
   conventional processes but also demonstrated the potential in
   manufacturing complex and/or customized parts with design freedom for
   industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We report a rare case of injected silicone oil migration into
   the upper eyelid, accompanied by lipogranulomatous inflammation and
   ptosis, after vitrectomy using a silicone oil tamponade.
   Case summary: An 83-year-old female presented to our clinic with left
   upper eyelid swelling and ptosis 2 months in duration. Five months
   prior, she had undergone 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy combined with
   Ahmed valve implantation to treat neovascular glaucoma. Four months
   prior, only about half the original volume of intraocular silicone oil
   remained, and a second oil injection was thus administered after removal
   of the remaining original oil. We found a mass in front of the left
   orbital septum; this was associated with gradual progression of the left
   upper eyelid swelling and ptosis. We resected the mass via a left upper
   eyelid skin incision 2 months after presentation. Histological
   examination of the excised tissue revealed necrotic fat consistent with
   lipogranulomatous inflammation. One week after excision, the ptosis
   disappeared. At the 4-month follow-up, the left upper eyelid was normal
   with no sign of recurrence.
   Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in
   South Korea of lipogranulomatous inflammation and ptosis induced by
   migration of injected silicone oil into the upper eyelid. Clinicians
   should be aware that swelling of the upper eyelid and a substantial
   decrease in the silicone oil level in the vitreous cavity, reflecting
   silicone oil leakage, maybe one of complications of vitrectomy.}},

Abstract = {{Relative contributions from environmental factors to daily actual
   evapotranspiration (ETa) across a variety of climate zones is a widely
   open research question, especially regarding the roles played by soil
   water content ((SWC); water supply) and net radiation ((Rn); energy
   supply) in controlling ETa. Here, the boosted regression tree method
   scheme was employed to quantify environmental controls on daily ETa
   using the global FLUXNET dataset. Similar to the general trend suggested
   by the Budyko theory at annual scales, the results showed that the
   relative control of SWC on daily ETa increased with increasing aridity
   index (phi); however, Rn played a major role at most FLUXNET sites
   (roughly phi < 4), indicating that Rn could be a leading control on
   daily ETa even at water-limited sites. The variability in the relative
   controls of SWC and Rn also partly depended on factors affecting water
   availability for daily ETa (e.g. vegetation characteristics and
   groundwater depth). Our study showed that other than SWC and Rn, the net
   effect of environmental controls (particularly leaf area index) on daily
   ETa was more important at drier sites than at relatively humid sites.
   This suggests that near-surface hydrological processes are more
   sensitive to vegetation variations due to their ability to extract deep
   soil water and enhance ETa, especially under arid and semi-arid climatic
   conditions. Our findings illustrate how environmental controls on daily
   ETa change as the climate dries, which has important implications for
   many scientific disciplines including hydrological, climatic, and
   agricultural studies.}},

Journal = {{COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{196}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, poly (mPEGMA-co-MAA) (PA) based on monomers of mPEGMA and
   MAA were synthesized, and different amino-beta-Cyclodextrins with
   various alkyl chains were conjugated to PA through carbodiimide-mediated
   coupling reactions. The obtained poly (mPEGMA-co-MAA-g-amino-beta-CD)
   (PA-g-amino-beta-CD) was characterized by FTIR, NMR and TGA. The
   fluorescence technique was used to investigate the micellization of
   PA-g-amino-beta-CDs. The results indicated that these polymers could
   self-assemble into nano-micelles in water, and PA-g-HDA-beta-CD
   possessed the lowest CMC value due to its long alkyl chains. In
   addition, the PA-g-HDA-beta-CD micelles were in spherical shapes with
   the diameter of 78.5 +/- 0.6 nm. The release of the model drug from
   PA-g-HDA-beta-CD micelles was increased as the pH reduced from 7.4-5.5
   at 37 degrees C. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake experiments were
   performed in HepG2, which showed that the cargo-free PA-g-HDA-beta-CD
   micelles did not have obvious cytotoxicity and were mainly distributed
   in the cytoplasm of HepG2 cells by endocytosis. Moreover, the study
   about in vivo distribution of the experimental rats indicated that the
   accumulation of PA-g-HDA-beta-CD micelles mainly happened in the liver.
   Therefore, the novel amino-beta-CD containing polymers exhibit good
   potential applications in drug delivery system.}},

Title = {{Recent advances in clinical studies of selenium supplementation in
   radiotherapy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{62}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Radiotherapy is one of the most important and common
   therapies for cancer patients. Selenium has been shown to be capable of
   reducing the side effects of radiotherapy because selenoproteins have
   anti-oxidative functions against reactive oxygen species that are
   induced by the radiation. They also function in DNA-repair and cytokine
   control.
   Purpose: We explored the benefits and risks of selenium supplementation
   in radiotherapy in our previous review to establish guidelines. In the
   current study, we expanded the search to cover recent advances in
   clinical studies of selenium supplementation in radiotherapy.
   Methods: We conducted an initial screening in the PubMed using the MeSH
   terms and keywords ``selenium{''}, ``radiation{''}, ``therapy{''}, and
   ``radiotherapy{''} using the same methodology applied in our previous
   review. We identified 121 articles published between January 2013 and
   December 2019. We then identified eight articles (six studies) on
   selenium and radiotherapy by excluding 113 articles.
   Results: In selenium supplementation studies, selenium doses of 300-500
   mu g/day with duration of 10 days to 6 months were used. Selenium
   supplementation improved the selenium nutritional conditions of the
   patients and reduced the side effects of radiotherapy. Selenium
   supplementation did not reduce the effectiveness of radiotherapy, and no
   toxicities were reported.
   Conclusion: The results of our previous and current reviews showed that
   selenium supplementation offers specific benefits for several cancer
   types treated with radiotherapy. Here, we suggest a new guideline for
   selenium supplementation in radiotherapy. We recommend determining the
   selenium status of the patients before radiotherapy, and in cases of
   deficiency (<100 mu g/L serum selenium level), selenium supplement can
   be beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{In laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) melt pool morphology plays an
   important role in generating part quality and microstructural
   properties. Therefore, it is of interest to correlate the melt pool
   dimensions with processing parameters. To overcome the drawback of
   current energy input equations, like volume energy density, lacking the
   inclusion of material thermophysical properties, in this investigation
   dimensionless enthalpy is used as characteristic factor to predict melt
   pool dimensions of single scan lines. The relation between dimensionless
   enthalpy and melt pool morphology is investigated for a nickel base
   alloy and a maraging tool steel. It is shown that melt pool width can be
   predicted successfully for both materials, while for the prediction of
   melt pool depth dimensionless enthalpy alone is not sufficient. To
   account for a deviation in heat loss between the two materials the
   Fourier number was included in the enthalpy relation. Furthermore, the
   influence of scan direction and baseplate location on melt pool
   morphology was evaluated. While a significant dependence on scan
   direction could not be shown, melt pool depth is found to dependent on
   part location on the base plate. This dependence has been attributed to
   the combined effect of laser angle deviation and shielding gas flow.}},

Title = {{Rhizosphere fungi actively assimilating plant-derived carbon in a

Journal = {{FUNGAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite the advantages of the next generation sequencing (NGS)
   techniques, one of their caveats is that they do not differentiate
   between microbes that are actively participating in carbon cycling in
   the rhizosphere and microbes performing other functions in the soils.
   Here we combined DNA-SIP with NGS to investigate which rhizosphere fungi
   actively assimilate plant-derived carbon. We provided (CO2)-C-13 to
   plants in intact soil cores collected from a grassland and sampled the
   rhizosphere in a time series to follow the fate of carbon in the
   rhizosphere mycobiome. We detected a difference between active
   rhizosphere fungi using plant-derived carbon and the total mycobiota:
   58\% of fungal species were using fresh rhizodeposits, and an additional
   22\% of fungal species received carbon several weeks later while 20\%
   were not involved in cycling of freshly photosynthesized carbon. We show

Abstract = {{Mixture properties were measured before and after field ageing to
   evaluate how aggregates, binder and environmental effects interact. To
   isolate these effects, very simple mixes (usually comprising one
   aggregate source and one binder) were designed and tested. The results
   showed that clear differences existed before and after field ageing
   where the same binder was utilised with different aggregates. Aggregate
   effects were magnified by field ageing. The results agree with a
   literature review that has documented aggregates' influence in response
   to environmental effects such as ageing for many years. When combined
   with the literature reviewed, the data collected should help ongoing
   discussions within the asphalt industry related to mixture testing and
   how to capture environmental effects/ageing. To truly capture in-service
   conditions, mixture conditioning that can simulate the simultaneous
   effects of the environment, aggregates and binder is likely to be the
   most effective approach based on the data reported in this paper. This
   is especially true today where mixtures are often very complex and
   contain many virgin and post-consumer ingredients.}},

Title = {{Biomass residues as twenty-first century bioenergy feedstock-a
   comparison of eight integrated assessment models}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the twenty-first century, modern bioenergy could become one of the
   largest sources of energy, partially replacing fossil fuels and
   contributing to climate change mitigation. Agricultural and forestry
   biomass residues form an inexpensive bioenergy feedstock with low
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, if harvested sustainably. We analysed
   quantities of biomass residues supplied for energy and their
   sensitivities in harmonised bioenergy demand scenarios across eight
   integrated assessment models (IAMs) and compared them with
   literature-estimated residue availability. IAM results vary
   substantially, at both global and regional scales, but suggest that
   residues could meet 7-50\% of bioenergy demand towards 2050, and 2-30\%
   towards 2100, in a scenario with 300 EJ/year of exogenous bioenergy
   demand towards 2100. When considering mean literature-estimated
   availability, residues could provide around 55 EJ/year by 2050.
   Inter-model differences primarily arise from model structure,
   assumptions, and the representation of agriculture and forestry. Despite
   these differences, drivers of residues supplied and underlying cost
   dynamics are largely similar across models. Higher bioenergy demand or
   biomass prices increase the quantity of residues supplied for energy,
   though their effects level off as residues become depleted. GHG emission
   pricing and land protection can increase the costs of using land for
   lignocellulosic bioenergy crop cultivation, which increases residue use
   at the expense of lignocellulosic bioenergy crops. In most IAMs and
   scenarios, supplied residues in 2050 are within literature-estimated
   residue availability, but outliers and sustainability concerns warrant
   further exploration. We conclude that residues can cost-competitively
   play an important role in the twenty-first century bioenergy supply,
   though uncertainties remain concerning (regional) forestry and
   agricultural production and resulting residue supply potentials.}},

Abstract = {{Present study is dealing the effects of carbon particles on MHD
   three-dimensional axisymmetric flow of water along a permeable stretched

   thermal conductivity of carbon nanotube that depends upon radius of
   particle is used to construct the mathematical model. Physical
   quantities of interest are also developed in terms of skin friction
   coefficient and local Nusselt number. Obtained results are developed
   from a system of nonlinear equations via numerically scheme (Runge-Kutta
   fourth order method). All obtained results for velocity and temperature
   profile are depends upon emerging parameters such as: Hartmann number M,
   nanoparticle volume fraction phi, Prandtl number Pr, suction/injection
   parameter 5, and dissipation parameters Ec, Ec(x) and Ec(y). Entire
   analysis described that results for SWCNTs provides the better heat

Abstract = {{Glutathione reductase (GSHR) is a biologically important enzyme involved
   in the conversion of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) into its reduced form,
   reduced glutathione (GSH), with the catalytic activity of NADPH. Most
   animals and aquatic organisms, including fish, possess high levels of
   this enzyme system to neutralize oxidative stress in cells. The current
   study was conducted to broaden our knowledge of GSHR in fish by
   identifying a mitochondrial isoform of this enzyme (LhGSHRm) in redlip
   mullet, Liza haematocheila, and clarifying its structure and function.
   The complete open reading frame of LhGSHRm consists of 1527 base pairs,
   encoding 508 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 55.43
   kDa. Multiple sequence alignment revealed the conservation of important
   amino acids in this fish. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the closest
   evolutionary relationship between LhGSHRm and other fish GSHRm
   counterparts. In tissue distribution analysis, the highest mRNA
   expression of LhGSHRm was observed in the gill tissue under normal
   physiological conditions. Following pathogenic challenges, the LhGSHRm
   transcription level was upregulated in a time-dependent manner in the
   gill and liver tissues, which may modulate the immune reaction against
   pathogens. rLhGSHRm showed considerable glutathione reductase activity
   in an enzyme assay. Further, the biological activity of rLhGSHRm in
   balancing cellular oxidative stress was observed in both disk diffusion
   and DPPH assays. Collectively, these results support that LhGSHRm has
   profound effects on modulating the immune reaction in fish to sustain
   precise redox homeostasis.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{The eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica contributes important
   ecological and structural elements to estuarine ecosystems worldwide.
   Oyster reef persistence requires regular recruitment as well as growth
   by existing individuals. Saltmarsh tidal creek oyster population age
   structure and growth rates directly influence local benthic-pelagic
   coupling and biogenic habitat formation. Recruitment monitoring,
   substrate deployments (2017-2020), and field surveys (2018) were
   conducted in North Inlet Estuary, SC, to quantitatively describe oyster
   age-shell height relationships, population age structure, daily growth
   rates, and survivorship. Multiple recruitment events resulted in three
   to four cohorts each year. Oysters exhibited rapid shell growth but most
   died by the end of their second growth season after attaining shell
   heights of less than 100 mm. Daily growth rates immediately after
   recruitment (approximately 0.07-0.29 mm day(-1)) and within the first 2
   y (0.1-0.4 mm day(-1)) allow maximum shell heights of 50-55 mm after to
   6-8 mo, 80 mm within 1 y, and 140 mm within 1.6 y. Recruitment timing
   strongly influenced shell heights after 1 y, with July recruits
   approximately 33\% larger than May recruits within the same year. The
   North Inlet oyster population age structure was dominated by oysters in
   their first (55\%) or second (45\%) growth season, with individuals less
   than 100 mm shell height composing approximately 99\% of the population.
   Oyster survivorship beyond 2 y appears to be unusual. The opportunistic
   life history strategy used by North Inlet oysters incorporates multiple
   large recruitment events each year and rapid growth rates to offset
   short life spans so as to maintain reef populations and related
   ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{The present study draws from Person-Environment (P-E) Fit theory to
   examine the relationship between Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)
   and self-employment status as well as the potential for gender to
   moderate this relationship. Two-wave archival data involving 29,000
   respondents of a representative sample provided overall support for our
   predictions. The results show that although there is a small positive
   overall effect linking NPD with self-employment, this relationship is
   moderated by gender such that narcissistic women are less likely to be
   self-employed than narcissistic men. Moreover, exploratory results
   demonstrate that narcissists do not ultimately benefit from
   self-employment status. Specifically, there was no difference in the
   incomes of narcissists who were self-employed and those who were not.
   These results suggest that the effects of narcissism on career choice is
   more complicated than initially believed.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction:The rapid economic and automobile growth in India leads to
   a rapid increase in road traffic accidents (RTAs) and factors affecting
   it. This study evaluates the epidemiology of trauma patients' reports to
   the major trauma center in New Delhi, India.
   Materials and methods:The 1,583 patients over 6 months reporting to the
   casualty of the trauma center attached to Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi
   were included in the study. The patients reporting to the outpatient
   department as follow-up visits were not included in the study. The data
   were collected with the help of a structured pro forma.
   Results: The data depicted the RTAs as the most common cause affecting
   adults between 20 years and 40 years. The study reports other risk
   factors like alcohol intoxication and motorcycle riders. Mostly, the
   patients present in a semiconscious and disoriented state requiring
   fluid resuscitation. Abrasions and bruises in the extremities stand out
   as the most common injury pattern. The fractures suffered were the most
   common injury suffered by the patients.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that RTAs and workplace injuries are the
   predominant causes of trauma affecting mostly the adults. This study
   defines the correlation of various parameters with causation and
   distribution of the trauma in the sample population. This study was
   performed to improve the understanding of the mode of trauma, severity
   of injuries, and outcome in our hospital, so that effective prevention
   and comprehensive management strategies could be made.
   Clinical significance:This study signifies the fundamental study for the
   occurrence, distribution, and prevention of trauma in the society. The
   acquisition of knowledge of different patterns of trauma patients along
   with other descriptive factors helps to understand the causation of this
   disease as well as development of preventive measures. This can form the
   basis of hospital and regional trauma management strategies.}},

Journal = {{OCHSNER JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{373-380}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The recommended gestational age to deliver pregnancies
   complicated by diabetes ranges from 34 to 39 weeks of gestation. The
   objective of this study was to determine the optimal gestational age for
   delivery of patients with diabetes to minimize perinatal death.
   Methods: We extracted a population-based cohort of singleton,
   nonanomalous infants of diabetic pregnancies from the Missouri birth
   registry for the period January 1, 1989 to December 31, 2005 and
   compared perinatal outcomes of planned deliveries at 37, 38, 39, and 40
   weeks to expectant management. Planned deliveries were identified by
   induction or cesarean delivery without documented medical or obstetric
   indications. The primary outcome was perinatal death, defined as
   stillbirth or neonatal death within 28 days of birth. Secondary outcomes
   were independent stillbirth, independent neonatal death, and a composite
   adverse neonatal event of assisted ventilation >30 minutes, birth
   injury, seizures, or 5-minute Apgar score <= 3. Groups were compared
   using t test and chi-square as appropriate.
   Results: In 4,905 diabetic pregnancies reaching 37 weeks, 1,012 (20.6\%)
   patients were insulin dependent. Overall, the risk of perinatal death at
   any gestational age examined was low (3/1,000 births or lower), as was
   the risk of the adverse perinatal outcome (<2\%). When only patients who
   were insulin dependent were included in the analysis, the risk of
   perinatal death at any gestational age remained low at 6 per 1,000
   births or fewer.
   Conclusion: Delivery as early as 37 weeks is reasonable for women who
   have diabetes, although the absolute risk of perinatal death is low at
   37 to 39 weeks.}},

Title = {{Expected ocean warming conditions significantly alter the transcriptome
   of developing postlarval American lobsters (Homarus americanus):
   Implications for energetic trade-offs}},
Journal = {{COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS \& PROTEOMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The American lobster (Homarus americanus) is one of the most iconic and
   economically valuable fishery species in the Northwestern Atlantic.
   Surface ocean temperatures are rapidly increasing across much of the
   species' range, raising concern about resiliency in the face of
   environmental change. Warmer temperatures accelerate rates of larval
   development and enhance survival to the postlarval stage, but the
   potential costs at the molecular level have rarely been addressed. We
   explored how exposure to current summer temperatures (16 degrees C) or
   tem-perature regimes mimicking projected moderate or extreme warming
   scenarios (18 degrees C and 22 degrees C, respectively) for the Gulf of
   Maine during development influences the postlarval lobster
   transcriptome. After de novo assembling the transcriptome, we identified
   2542 differentially expressed (DE; adjusted p < 0.05) transcripts in
   postlarvae exposed to 16 degrees C vs. 22 degrees C, and 422 DE
   transcripts in postlarvae reared at 16 degrees C vs. 18 degrees C.
   Lobsters reared at 16 degrees C significantly over-expressed transcripts
   related to cuticle formation and the immune response up to 14.4and
   8.5-fold respectively, relative to those reared at both 18 degrees C and
   22 degrees C. In contrast, the expression of transcripts affiliated with
   metabolism increased up to 7.1-fold as treatment temperature increased.
   These results suggest that lobsters exposed to projected warming
   scenarios during development experience a shift in the transcriptome
   that reflects a potential trade-off between maintaining immune defenses
   and sustaining increased physiological rates under a warming
   environment. This could have major implications for post-settlement
   survival through increased risk of mortality due to disease and/or
   starvation if energetic demands cannot be met.}},

Title = {{U-Pb DATING OF HYDROTHERMAL TITANITE RESOLVES MULTIPLE PHASES OF
   PROPYLITIC ALTERATION IN THE OYU TOLGOI PORPHYRY DISTRICT, MONGOLIA}},
Journal = {{ECONOMIC GEOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Oyu Tolgoi is a world-class, Late Devonian porphyry district in southern
   Mongolia. Because of its age and geodynamic setting, it has undergone a
   complex geological history that includes major postmineralization
   magmatichydrothermal events in close proximity to the porphyry deposits.
   The propylitic alteration halos that surround the Cu-Au deposits contain
   widespread hydrothermal titanite, as do the younger altered volcanic and
   intrusive rocks.
   Here, we present a comprehensive laser ablation-inductively coupled
   plasma-mass spectrometry U-Pb study on in situ, propylitic titanite from
   the Oyu Tolgoi district. The results identify district-wide hydrothermal
   alteration episodes that coincide with known magmatic events: Devonian
   porphyry mineralization (similar to 372 Ma); the intrusion of
   granodiorite plutons and andesite dikes in the Carboniferous (similar to
   320-310 Ma); and the emplacement of the Permian Khanbogd Granite
   alkaline batholith (similar to 290 Ma). Both Carboniferous and Permian
   alteration events variably overprint the earlier porphyry alteration
   halo. Overdispersion in the U-Pb data from some samples, due to Pb
   and/or U mobility, makes interpretation of some titanite ages more
   difficult, but further exemplifies the complex alteration history of the
   district. We conclude that U-Pb dating of propylitic titanite is a
   viable means by which explorers can identify alteration within a
   prospect that is synchronous with potentially fertile intrusions of
   known age. The extent of the coeval propylitic alteration and its
   mineral chemistry can then be used to assess the likelihood of a major
   porphyry center being present.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Wireless pH monitoring measures esophageal acid
   exposure time (AET) for up to 96 hours. We evaluated competing methods
   of analysis of wireless pH data.
   METHODS: Adult patients with persisting reflux symptoms despite acid
   suppression (n = 322, 48.5 - 0.9 years, 61.7\% women) from 2 tertiary
   centers were evaluated using symptom questionnaires and wireless pH
   monitoring off therapy, from November 2013 through September 2017; 30
   healthy adults (control subjects; 26.9 - 1.5 years; 60.0\% women) were
   similarly evaluated. Concordance of daily AET (physiologic <4\%,
   borderline 4\%-6\%, pathologic >6\%) for 2 or more days constituted the
   predominant AET pattern. Each predominant pattern (physiologic,
   borderline, or pathologic) in relation to data from the first day, and
   total averaged AET, were compared with other interpretation paradigms
   (first 2 days, best day, or worst day) and with symptoms.
   RESULTS: At least 2 days of AET data were available from 96.9\% of
   patients, 3 days from 90.7\%, and 4 days from 72.7\%. A higher
   proportion of patients had a predominant pathologic pattern (31.4\%)
   than control subjects (11.1\%; P = .03). When 3 or more days of data
   were available, 90.4\% of patients had a predominant AET pattern; when 2
   days of data were available, 64.1\% had a predominant AET pattern (P <
   .001). Day 1 AET was discordant with the predominant pattern in 22.4\%
   of patients and was less strongly associated with the predominant
   pattern compared with 48 hour AET (P = .059) or total averaged AET (P =
   .02). Baseline symptom burden was higher in patients with a predominant
   pathologic pattern compared with a predominant physiologic pattern (P =
   .02).
   CONCLUSIONS: The predominant AET pattern on prolonged wireless pH
   monitoring can identify patients at risk for reflux symptoms and
   provides gains over 24 hours and 48 hours recording, especially when
   results from the first 2 days are discordant or borderline.}},

Abstract = {{This article was to collect and assess information about prostitution,
   khalwat (close proximity), cohabitation and rape in a Kelantanese Malay
   community. Writing within the perspective of social history, the focused
   on the period from 1916 to 1941, because some primary sources such as
   Kelantan Council of Islamic Religion and Malay Custom (MAIK), Kelantan
   Hall's Office and Kelantan Minister's Office reports on this period have
   recently become available at the National Archives of Malaysia. This
   article analyses the phenomenon of prostitution among Malay women in
   Kelantan before the Second World War. Divorce, poverty, and lack of
   education were among the major factors which drive Malay women into
   prostitution. This study reveals that failure to provide the living for
   the family and irresponsibility, lack of religious knowledge and
   economic attraction were among the factors that drove women to khalwat
   and cohabitation. The women were usually married or recently divorced
   and had partners were from different profession backgrounds, made up of
   Malay and non-Malays. Cases of khalwat, cohabitation and rape were
   usually disclosed by a third party to MAIK. In addition, this article
   discusses Notice no.26 of 1916 on the role of MAIK in controlling the
   problem of sexual misconduct. MAIK had power to arrest individuals
   without warrant, admonishing them, banishing prostitutes and pimps, as
   well as meting out imprisonment and fines. This law showed that MAIK,
   since its establishment in 1915, had tried it best to curb social and
   moral ills among Kelantan Muslims at that time. The study was able to
   fill the space in writing about Malaysian social history and gender
   studies, especially before the Second World War.}},

   diseases. Here, we report results of a UK retail survey, which
   investigated the effect of the production region (Mediterranean vs.

   production system (organic vs. conventional) on antioxidant activity and
   concentrations of phenolic compounds in table grapes. Black grapes had
   similar to 180\% total antioxidant activity (TAA), similar to 60\%
   higher total phenolic content (TPC) and similar to 40 times higher
   anthocyanin concentrations (TAC) than white grapes, while red grapes had
   intermediate levels of TAA, TPC and TAC. The effects of season and
   production system and differences between varieties of the same grape
   type were substantially smaller. Grapes imported from Mediterranean
   countries in summer had a 14\% higher TPC and similar to 20\% higher TAA
   than grapes imported from South Africa in winter, and organic grapes had
   a 16\% higher TPC and 22\% higher TAA, but similar to 30\% lower TAC

Title = {{Dynamic harvesting- and energy-aware real-time task scheduling}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING-INFORMATICS \& SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{28}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Energy harvesting, along with effective storage of the energy, is a very
   common approach to attain sustainable computing in today's embedded
   systems. Employing a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which
   constitutes of two or more types of energy storage systems (ESSs), helps
   to compensate for the weaknesses of one ESS type using the strengths of
   another type. The capacity of an ESS, and thus that of a HESS, can be
   modeled by dividing it into Instantly Available Charge (IAC) and
   Instantly Unavailable Charge (IUC) parts; the existing charge in an ESS
   always flows from the part with higher voltage to the other one. The
   main idea of this study is to intelligently control the flows in the
   HESS to maximizing either the IAC or the IUC charge. We propose the HLPF
   real-time task scheduling algorithm to do so through deciding to execute
   the tasks in the ascending or descending order of their power
   requirements. Extensive simulations show impressive lifetime
   improvements of up to 20 \% in comparison to the classical real-time
   task scheduling algorithms. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Pages = {{2661-2670}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In ballastless railway track, the elastic rail clip (i.e., an e-clip) is
   applied to maintain the rail in proper positions by mean of a
   compressive toe load. If the e-clip moves from its initial installation;
   the toe load may deviate from its specification. In this study, the
   influences of e-clip's malposition on the toe load, stress, and friction
   were numerically evaluated. The toe loads of inner and outer e-clips
   increased with the increase in malposition. However, the toe loads of
   inner e-clip were slightly higher than those of outer e-clip because of
   the geometries of base plate and cast shoulder. The maximum von Mises
   stresses and the maximum normal stresses were found at the inner
   curvature of e-clip's rear arch. The friction forces on the contacts
   between heel of e-clip vs. cast shoulder and toe of e-clip vs. insulator
   were slightly influenced by the malposition. However, the influence of
   malposition on the friction force on the contact between leg of e-clip
   vs. slot of cast shoulder was more prominent. The findings can be used
   as a guideline for the installation and maintenance to ensure the
   structural safety of a ballastless railway track.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces an adaptive disturbance estimation and
   compensation approach for delta parallel robots using three methods. The
   first method is based on the adaptive Kalman filter (AKF), the second
   method uses the Low pass filtered robot dynamic model (LFDM) while the
   third method is acceleration measurement based (AMB) method which
   utilizes the measured moving platform acceleration directly into the
   robot dynamical model. The considered disturbance is joint friction,
   uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics, their effects are represented as
   lumped disturbance torque vector. The estimation performance is
   evaluated using the mean square error (MSE) as a performance measure. To
   control the robot, the nonlinear robot model is linearized using
   feedback linearization through the estimated disturbance which is
   adaptively scaled using an adaptive tuning gain to overcome the
   limitations of the transient response of the estimated disturbance. The
   tuning is governed by a simple developed sliding surface depending on
   the error between the desired and actual joint angles. The tuned
   disturbance is added directly to the classical proportional-derivative
   (PD) controller output control signal for disturbance compensation and
   trajectory tracking. Based on the results, a comparison among the three
   methods is studied. The comparison shows that the AKF method is the most
   accurate that tracks the desired trajectory in the presence of
   disturbance and noise. The other methods are not recommended. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe the extent and variation of critical care services
   in Pakistan.
   Materials and methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in all
   intensive care units (ICUs) recognised for postgraduate training to
   determine administration, infrastructure, equipment, staffing, and
   training.
   Results: There were 151 hospitals recognised for training, providing
   2166 ICU beds and 1473 ventilators. Regional distribution of ICU beds
   per 100,000 population ranged from 1.0 in Sindh to none in Gilgit
   Baltistan (median 0.7). A senior clinician trained in critical care was
   available in 19 (12.1\%) of units. One-to-one nurse-to-bed ratio during
   the day was available in 84 (53.5\%) of units, dropping to 75 (47.8\%)
   at night. Availability of 1:1 nursing also varied between provinces,
   ranging from 56.5\% in Punjab compared to 0\% in Azad Jamu Kashmir.
   Similarly, there was disparity in the availability of ventilators
   between provinces. All ICUs had basic infrastructure (electricity,
   running water, piped oxygen) and basic equipment (electronic monitoring
   and infusion pumps).
   Conclusion: Pakistan, a lower middle-income country, has an established
   network of critical care facilities with access to basic equipment, but
   inequalities in its distribution. Investment in critical care training
   for doctors and nurses is needed. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Race, class and empire in nineteenth-century England inflected
   understandings of japanned papier mache, influencing both its brief
   popularity and its abrupt demise in the 1860s. Although the material was
   rarely used as an explicit signifier in nineteenth-century literature or
   theory, or indeed mentioned at all, its inclusion in the Great
   Exhibition suggests its cultural and industrial centrality. This article
   proposes that this disparity results not from an absence of meaning, but
   from too great a complexity and too clear a set of implications. As an
   imitation of an East Asian form, japanned papier mache represented an
   Orientalizing fantasy; as a shiny black surface, japanned papier mache
   tapped into both desires and anxieties surrounding racial Blackness; as
   a backdrop for depictions of recognizably British landscapes and
   architecture; and as a distinctively British industry, japanned papier
   mache offered a kind of national identity-fashioning. Tying a ubiquitous
   but understudied material of the English mid-nineteenth century to
   broader histories of the British empire, this article demonstrates the
   tidy encapsulation of the fraught and complex 1850s and 1860s into the
   materiality, forms and failure of japanned papier mache.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Abu Tartur open-pit Phosphate mine and underground
   tunnels have been studied from radiation safety point of view. Radon,
   radon daughters and thoron daughters were measured by collecting (31)
   samples from (5) main sites that represent the process of Phosphate
   mining. Results of radon, radon daughters and thoron daughters, in case
   of open-pit mining ranged from 1.37 to 131.52 Bq m-3, 0.000099 to 0.0024
   WL, and 0 to 0.92 Bq.m-3 respectively. For postpone tunnels, results of
   radon, radon daughters, thoron daughters ranged from 411.55 to 2539.27
   Bq m-3, 0.056 to 0.37 WL, and 1.26 to 3.89 Bq.m-3 respectively. Also,
   gamma radiation levels, surface contamination and effective annual dose
   were measured. Gamma radiation levels ranged from 0.07 to 0.6 mSv/h for
   openpit mine and from 0.24 to 0.5 mSv/h for tunnels. Surface
   contamination measurements gave normal readings for open-pit mining and
   7.1 in underground mine. The effective annual dose ranged from 0.033 to
   0.153 mSv/y for open-pit and 4.948 mSv/y for tunnels. The results, in
   case of open-pit mine, are lower than permissible limits determined by
   UNSCEAR, 2010 while exceeds the permissible limits in case of
   underground tunnels. So the open-pit mining is much safer from the
   occupational radiation protection point of view.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring radiation dose in a mixed radiation field cannot be performed
   by using only one dosimeter, but a pair of dosimeters, TLD600 and TLD700
   can be successfully used to estimate that radiation dose. Therefore, in
   the present study, the response of TLD600 and TLD700 to neutron/gamma
   mixed radiation field was deeply discussed. Moreover, the sensitivity
   and stability of TLD600 and TLD700 were studied. A strong correlation
   between TL output signal intensity of TLD700 to gamma dose appeared,
   with a linear coefficient of R-2 = 0.99. Likewise, a strong correlation
   between TL output signal intensity of TLD600 to gamma dose and neutron
   irradiation was also evident, with a linear coefficient of R-2 = 0.99.
   Thus, TLD700 can be applied to measure gamma dose with good sensitivity,
   while TLD600 can be applied to measure both gamma and neutron dose.
   Hence, a combination of TLD700 and TLD600 can be successfully employed

Title = {{Housing Flexibility: A Framework for a Quantitative Evaluation Method
   due to Turkish Designers}},
Journal = {{ICONARP INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{545-566}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Flexibility became an important factor affecting the quality of housing
   projects in Turkey nowadays due to the requirement of the permanent
   mobile/dynamic lifestyle. Thus, a responsive housing design should be
   developed to allow modifications that respond to the changing demands of
   the tenants through time. Although it is a major debate in housing
   design for many years in western countries; the Turkish perspective of
   housing ignores the adjustment to changing needs and compensates it with
   big-sized dwellings, causing space consumption. This contradicts with
   the Turkish roots emerged from the nomadic lifestyle with the tent.
   Housing flexible design is an essential requirement in Turkish culture
   historically. This study aims to develop a quantitative evaluation
   method, in order to assess the level of flexibility, defining the
   indicators and the hierarchy to measure it.
   Design/Methodology/Approach
   In order to establish a Flexibility Assessment System, Value Engineering
   method is applied, a tool used in decision-making process to choose the
   ideal solutions. Additionally, this system will contribute to the
   improvement of the ``architectural quality of housing{''} in Turkey,
   since now it is evaluated and commercialized merely by the calculations
   of the surface areas.
   Findings
   Despite that most of the experts have a different understanding and
   evaluation of flexibility, they concurred on some indicators to measure
   and evaluate flexibility. Moreover, this study has created a clearer
   definition of the terminology of flexibility from the point of view of
   Turkish society and provided basic guidelines for the implementation of
   flexible housing design.
   Research Limitations/Implications
   Quantifying a complex design parameter as flexibility using the Value
   engineering method requires the division and analyse the opinion of
   expert separately from the end users' opinion.
   Originality/Value
   This study is the first study defining the criteria of flexibility, and
   their quantitative evaluation from Turkish cultural view. Moreover this
   study creates a more clear definition of the terminology of flexibility
   from the point of view of Turkish society and provides basic guidelines
   for the implementation of flexible housing design.}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{14386-14402}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Rough surfaces in contact with a flow of fluid exhibit alternating
   no-slip and free shear boundary conditions at the solid-liquid and
   air-liquid interfaces, respectively, thereby potentially offering drag
   reduction benefits. The balance between the dynamic pressure in the flow
   and the restoring capillary pressure in the interasperity spaces
   determines the stability of the Cassie state of wettability and is a
   function of the relative extent of no-slip and free shear regions per
   unit surface area. In the present study, using a fractal representation
   of rough surface topography, an analytical model is developed to
   quantify the stability of the Cassie state of wettability as well as
   drag reduction and the friction factor for laminar flow in a rectangular
   channel between nonwetting multiscale rough surfaces. A systematic study
   is conducted to quantify the effects of fractal parameters of the
   surfaces and the flow Reynolds number on drag reduction and the friction
   factor. The studies are used to develop friction factor curves extending
   the classical Moody diagram to hydrophobic and superhydrophobic
   surfaces. On the basis of the studies, regime maps are derived for
   estimating the extent of drag reduction offered by hydrophobic and
   superhydrophobic surfaces, revealing that superhydrophobic surfaces do
   not always offer the best drag reduction performance. The application of
   the fractal model to practical topographies of nonwetting surfaces of
   copper, aluminum, and zinc oxide fabricated via electrodeposition and
   etching is also discussed.}},

Title = {{Hippocampal Neural Stem Cell Grafting after Status Epilepticus
   Alleviates Chronic Epilepsy and Abnormal Plasticity, and Maintains
   Better Memory and Mood Function}},
Journal = {{AGING AND DISEASE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Hippocampal damage after status epilepticus (SE) leads to multiple
   epileptogenic changes, which lead to chronic temporal lobe epilepsy
   (TLE). Morbidities such as spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and
   memory and mood impairments are seen in a significant fraction of SE
   survivors despite the administration of antiepileptic drugs after SE. We
   examined the efficacy of bilateral intra-hippocampal grafting of neural
   stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) derived from the embryonic day 19 rat
   hippocampi, six days after SE for restraining SE-induced SRS, memory,
   and mood impairments in the chronic phase. Grafting of NSCs curtailed
   the progression of SRS at 3-5 months post-SE and reduced the frequency
   and severity of SRS activity when examined at eight months post-SE.
   Reduced SRS activity was also associated with improved memory function.
   Graft-derived cells migrated into different hippocampal cell layers,
   differentiated into GABA-ergic interneurons, astrocytes, and
   oligodendrocytes. Significant percentages of graft-derived cells also
   expressed beneficial neurotrophic factors such as the fibroblast growth
   factor-2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth
   factor-1 and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. NSC grafting
   protected neuropeptide Y- and parvalbumin-positive host interneurons,
   diminished the abnormal migration of newly born neurons, and rescued the
   reelin+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus. Besides, grafting led to the
   maintenance of a higher level of normal neurogenesis in the chronic

Title = {{Impact of scaling up dolutegravir on antiretroviral resistance in South
   Africa: A modeling study}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Author summary
   Why was this study done?
   The scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited
   settings has achieved an unprecedented reduction in HIV-related
   morbidity and mortality.
   The success of ART is however threatened by increasing levels of
   resistance to antiretroviral drugs of the non-nucleoside reverse
   transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) class.
   Replacing NNRTIs by dolutegravir (DTG) may curb the spread of
   resistance, but it is unclear how effective this switch will be and
   which patient groups should be switched from NNRTI to DTG.
   It has been debated whether DTG should be given to women, because of a
   potential risk of birth defects, and to patients already on an
   NNRTI-based therapy.
   What did the researchers do and find?
   Using a mathematical model simulating the HIV epidemic in South Africa,
   we find that scaling up DTG-based ART can halt the increase of NNRTI
   resistance.
   This predicted effect of DTG depends crucially on including both women
   and people already on NNRTI-based ART among patients to whom DTG will be
   prescribed.
   Restricting DTG to men or to patients initiating ART would substantially
   reduce its potential to curb resistance at the population level, as in
   this case it could merely slow down but not halt the spread of NNRTI
   resistance.
   Patients still relying on NNRTI-based therapy would in this case face
   increased risk of resistance and therapy failure.
   What do these findings mean?
   Our model highlights the potential of DTG scale up to curb NNRTI
   resistance.
   In order to halt the increase in NNRTI resistance, DTG should become
   accessible to both women and people currently on NNRTI-based therapy.
   Background
   Rising resistance of HIV-1 to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
   inhibitors (NNRTIs) threatens the success of the global scale-up of
   antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to WHO-recommended dolutegravir
   (DTG)-based regimens could reduce this threat due to DTG's high genetic
   barrier to resistance. We used mathematical modeling to predict the
   impact of the scale-up of DTG-based ART on NNRTI pretreatment drug
   resistance (PDR) in South Africa, 2020 to 2040.
   Methods and findings
   We adapted the Modeling Antiretroviral drug Resistance In South Africa
   (MARISA) model, an epidemiological model of the transmission of NNRTI
   resistance in South Africa. We modeled the introduction of DTG in 2020
   under 2 scenarios: DTG as first-line regimen for ART initiators, or DTG
   for all patients, including patients on suppressive NNRTI-based ART.
   Given the safety concerns related to DTG during pregnancy, we assessed
   the impact of prescribing DTG to all men and in addition to (1) women
   beyond reproductive age; (2) women beyond reproductive age or using
   contraception; and (3) all women. The model projections show that,
   compared to the continuation of NNRTI-based ART, introducing DTG would
   lead to a reduction in NNRTI PDR in all scenarios if ART initiators are
   started on a DTG-based regimen, and those on NNRTI-based regimens are
   rapidly switched to DTG. NNRTI PDR would continue to increase if
   DTG-based ART was restricted to men. When given to all men and women,
   DTG-based ART could reduce the level of NNRTI PDR from 52.4\% (without
   DTG) to 10.4\% (with universal DTG) in 2040. If only men and women
   beyond reproductive age or on contraception are started on or switched
   to DTG-based ART, NNRTI PDR would reach 25.9\% in 2040. Limitations
   include substantial uncertainty due to the long-term predictions and the
   current scarcity of knowledge about DTG efficacy in South Africa.
   Conclusions
   Our model shows the potential benefit of scaling up DTG-based regimens
   for halting the rise of NNRTI resistance. Starting or switching all men
   and women to DTG would lead to a sustained decline in resistance levels,
   whereas using DTG-based ART in all men, or in men and women beyond
   childbearing age, would only slow down the increase in levels of NNRTI
   PDR.}},

Title = {{Scattering of Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic Waves by a
   Localized Seismogenic Ionospheric Perturbation: Observation and
   Interpretation}},
Journal = {{RADIO SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A significant anomaly in the extremely low frequency (ELF) spectra of
   Schumann resonance (SR) was discovered for the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake
   (EQ) in Taiwan as observed in Japan. Similar phenomena were confirmed
   for other EQs remote from the observer by a few megameters. An
   additional effect was detected for nearby EQs. The anomalies were
   explained by ELF radio wave scattering from a seismogenic disturbance.
   The global thunderstorms serve as the source positioned at the equator,
   and the localized seismogenic perturbation was placed above the EQ
   epicenter. We evaluate a seismic impact on SR power spectra using the
   realistic conductivity profile of atmosphere. The nonuniformity above EQ
   epicenter is axially symmetric varying along the radius according to
   Gaussian law whose scale depends on the magnitude. We use the complex
   characteristic heights relevant to the regular and disturbed cavities.
   These are substituted into the two-dimensional telegraph equation (2DTE)
   for electric and magnetic fields. Deviations from the regular spectra
   are the seismogenic modifications that depend on the EQ magnitude.
   Computations indicate that a distant localized seismogenic nonuniformity
   provides a noticeable impact when the EQ magnitude exceeds the M = 7
   threshold. The effect is also modeled of the nearby (up to 500 km)
   moderate (magnitude 5.5) EQs. The resonance spectra of disturbed fields
   become elevated as a whole. The distance dependence of field disturbance
   repeats seismogenic modifications in the characteristic heights above
   the observer. Model computations are compared with available
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a brain injury caused by physical
   external forces on the head that leads to changes in the brain tissue.
   Epidemiologic studies help to identify the key opportunities for
   decreasing burden of TBI, cost-effective prevention and treatment of
   TBI. This study was conducted to investigate the epidemiology and
   radiologic findings of patients with traumatic brain injures who
   referred to emergency department in Iran. In this retrospective
   descriptive-analytic study, the data of patients (n=267) with TBI
   admitted to Emergency Department of Shahid Mohammadi hospital of
   Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences were considered during 2017
   year. The administrative dataset of Shahid Mohammadi hospital was used
   in the current study. Mean of age for patients was 29.87 years and 228
   patients (85.00\%) were men and 39 patients (15.00\%) were women. The
   most trauma was associated to road accidents (n=203, 67\%), 58 cases
   (21.70\%) for falling from heights, 4 cases (1.54\%) for struggle and 2
   cases (0.7\%) for water injury. The data showed that 35 patients
   (13.10\%) were dead due to trauma and 232 patients (86.90\%) survived.
   The results showed that epidural hematoma (EDH) (n=79) and subarachnoid
   hemorrhage (SAH) (n=71) had most incidence. The results showed a
   significant relation between age and trauma mechanism (P<0.05), so that
   58 patients <18 years of age injured from road accidents, while 133
   patients 18-60 years of age injured form road accidents. In conclusion,
   the most common causes of TBI in Bandar Abbas are accidents that must be
   reduced by traffic rules and transport safety.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DRUGS IN DERMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1146-1148}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Studies have shown oxytocin (OT) and its carrier protein
   neurophysin 1 are found in the epidermis. The oxytocin receptor, which
   is found on human fibroblasts has been shown, when activated by
   oxytocin, to inhibit senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).
   SASP activation induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines which
   contribute to skin aging. Therefore, its inhibition by oxytocin would
   constitute a protective mechanism. This pilot study was designed to
   explore clinical evidence of oxytocin levels correlating to the skin's
   appearance in subjects.
   Methods: Oxytocin levels, facial photographs, and lifetime sun exposure
   questionnaires from six female subjects aged 48-61 years old were
   analyzed. A skin age score (SAS) was determined for each subject and was
   compared to the expected average SAS for each subject based on their age
   to determine a percentage in change, if any. A reduction in SAS would
   indicate more youthful appearing skin than the average person of that
   age.
   Results: All subjects had at least some reduction in SAS score as
   compared to their expected score. An almost linear relationship of SAS
   reduction as related to OT levels was found, showing a correlation of
   more youthful appearing skin with higher OT levels.
   Conclusions: This study links previously published evidence of
   oxytocin's protective role against inflammatory cytokine release in the
   skin with clinical evidence of OT levels correlating with SAS scores.
   Furthermore, it shows OT is likely inducing a protective function in the
   epidermis in the case of sun exposure and possibly with intrinsic aging.}},

Abstract = {{In this study functional film enrichment with antioxidant of bamboo
   leaves (AOB) was prepared based on carboxymethyl cellulose-gelatin
   (CMC-Gel) mixture using casting method. Microstructures of the films
   were performed on atomic force microscope, Fourier transform infrared
   spectrometer, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The physical properties,
   including the viscosity of film forming solutions, the water vapor
   permeability, mechanical properties, thermodynamics and transparence of
   CMC-Gel films were determined. The addition of AOB had not induced
   notable change on the surface structure features. The good compatibility
   among AOB, CMC and gelatin was illustrated by XRD for that the
   crystallization disappeared of gelatin in CMC-Gel composite film and no
   diffraction peaks in functionalized films. Viscosity and glass
   transition temperature of the film with 0.2\% AOB were 779.2 +/- 26.2
   mPa.s and 83.24 degrees C, respectively, which were higher than those of
   all other samples. The water vapor permeation resistance and elongation
   at break of the films significantly decreased when the concentration of

Abstract = {{A probabilistic model is proposed that uses observation data to estimate
   failure probabilities during excavations. The model integrates a
   Bayesian network and distanced-based Bayesian model updating. In the
   network, the movement of a retaining wall is selected as the indicator
   of failure, and the observed ground surface settlement is used to update
   the soil parameters. The responses of wall deflection and ground surface
   settlement are accurately predicted using finite element analysis. An
   artificial neural network is employed to construct the response surface
   relationship using the aforementioned input factors. The proposed model
   effectively estimates the uncertainty of influential factors. A case
   study of a braced excavation is presented to demonstrate the feasibility
   of the proposed approach. The update results facilitate accurate
   estimates according to the target value, from which the corresponding
   probabilities of failure are obtained. The proposed model enables
   failure probabilities to be determined with real-time result updating.}},

   death has no effect on long-run growth and a negative effect on welfare.
   By contrast, when money is introduced via the cash-in-advance (CIA)
   constraint on consumption, the increase in the probability of death
   decreases long-run growth and welfare under elastic labor supply.
   Calibration shows that the quantitative effect of an increase in the
   probability of death on welfare is much larger compared to that on

Title = {{Allele-specific PCR with a novel data processing method based on
   difference value for single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of ALDH2
   gene}},
Journal = {{TALANTA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{220}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis based on allele-specific
   polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) is a relatively effective and
   economical method compared with other genotyping technologies such as
   DNA sequencing, DNA hybridization and isothermal amplification
   strategies. But AS-PCR is limited by its labor-intensive optimization of
   reaction parameters and time-consuming result assessment. In this study,
   we put forward a novel idea of data processing to address this problem.
   SNP analysis was accomplished by AS-PCR with endpoint electrochemical
   detection. For each sample, two separate reactions were run
   simultaneously with two sets of allele-specific primers (wild-type
   primers for W system and mutant primers for M system). We measured their
   redox current signals on screen-printed electrodes once AS-PCR finished
   and calculated the difference value of current signals between two
   systems to determine the genotyping result. Based on the difference
   value of fluorescent signals, real-time fluorescent PCR was used to
   study reaction parameters in AS-PCR. With screened parameters, we
   obtained the genotyping results within 50 min. 36 hair-root samples from
   volunteers were analyzed by our method and their genotypes of ALDH2 gene
   (encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase 2) were totally identical with data
   from commercialized sequencing. Our work first employed difference value
   between two reaction systems to differentiate allele and provided a
   novel idea of data processing in AS-PCR method. It is able to promote
   the quick analysis of SNP in the fields of health monitor, disease
   precaution, and personalized diagnosis and treatment.}},

Title = {{Comparing SNNs and RNNs on neuromorphic vision datasets: Similarities
   and differences}},
Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{108-120}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Neuromorphic data, recording frameless spike events, have attracted
   considerable attention for the spatiotemporal information components and
   the event-driven processing fashion. Spiking neural networks (SNNs)
   represent a family of event-driven models with spatiotemporal dynamics
   for neuromorphic computing, which are widely benchmarked on neuromorphic
   data. Interestingly, researchers in the machine learning community can
   argue that recurrent (artificial) neural networks (RNNs) also have the
   capability to extract spatiotemporal features although they are not
   event-driven. Thus, the question of ``what will happen if we benchmark
   these two kinds of models together on neuromorphic data{''}comes out but
   remains unclear.
   In this work, we make a systematic study to compare SNNs and RNNs on
   neuromorphic data, taking the vision datasets as a case study. First, we
   identify the similarities and differences between SNNs and RNNs
   (including the vanilla RNNs and LSTM) from the modeling and learning
   perspectives. To improve comparability and fairness, we unify the
   supervised learning algorithm based on backpropagation through time
   (BPTT), the loss function exploiting the outputs at all timesteps, the
   network structure with stacked fully-connected or convolutional layers,
   and the hyper-parameters during training. Especially, given the
   mainstream loss function used in RNNs, we modify it inspired by the rate
   coding scheme to approach that of SNNs. Furthermore, we tune the
   temporal resolution of datasets to test model robustness and
   generalization. At last, a series of contrast experiments are conducted
   on two types of neuromorphic datasets: DVS-converted (N-MNIST) and
   DVS-captured (DVS Gesture). Extensive insights regarding recognition
   accuracy, feature extraction, temporal resolution and contrast, learning
   generalization, computational complexity and parameter volume are
   provided, which are beneficial for the model selection on different
   workloads and even for the invention of novel neural models in the
   future. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   bearing: FPB (isolated bearing) and spherical steel bearing
   (non-isolated bearing). The nonlinear time history analysis is carried
   out to compare the seismic responses of FPB-isolated and non-isolated
   bridges. Based on the comparison results, the seismic isolation ratios
   of FPB are defined and obtained. In addition, a new criterion index is
   presented to quantifiably measure the effectiveness of the seismic
   isolation of FPB-isolated bridges with different pier heights, which is
   beneficial to the further popularization and application of FPB in the
   seismic design of bridge engineering.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the current paper, the coupled fatigue hysteretic behaviors in
   ferroelectric ceramics are modeled by a blending a phenomenological
   hysteresis model with point defects. The time-dependent phenomenological
   model is employed to capture the hysteresis loops associated with phase
   transitions. The fatigue hysteresis is modeled by combining the
   single-crystal model with time functions. The mechanism of fatigue in
   ferroelectric ceramics is interpreted as an accumulation of residual
   polarization in the proposed model. Numerical results of static and
   dynamic hysteretic behaviors are presented and compared to their
   experimental counterparts. The capability of the proposed model for
   capturing the fatigue phenomenon is validated.}},

Abstract = {{Dianthus chinensis is an important ornamental species in the genus
   Dianthus. Its high tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses is
   beneficial for genetic improvements of Dianthus. In this paper, we
   conducted a karyotype analysis on mitotic chromosomes of D. chinensis.
   Its genome size (2C value) and GC content were measured by flow
   cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) and 4', 6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole
   (DAPI) as dyes. The results showed that the D. chinensis has 2n = 2 chi=
   30 chromosomes. The chromosomes are metacentric or submetacentric. Their
   length varies from 1.60 +/- 0.57 to 4.70 +/- 0.85 um. The estimation of
   its genome size is 772.53 +/- 0.91 Mbp and GC content is 39.80 +/-
   0.12\%. The cytological information of D. chinensis is helpful to
   clarify phylogenic relationships and assess potential plant

Abstract = {{Background. Given access barriers to cognitive behavioral therapy for
   chronic pain (CBT-CP), this pragmatic superiority trial will determine
   whether a remotely delivered CBT-CP intervention that addresses these
   barriers outperforms in-person and other synchronous forms of CBT-CP for
   veterans with musculoskeletal pain. Design. This pragmatic trial
   compares an asynchronous form of CBT-CP that uses interactive voice
   response (IVR) to allow patients to participate from their home (IVR
   CBT-CP) with synchronous CBT-CP delivered by a Department of Veterans
   Affairs (VA) clinician. Veterans (n=764; 50\% male) with chronic
   musculoskeletal pain throughout nine VA medical centers will
   participate. The primary outcome is pain interference after treatment (4
   months). Secondary outcomes, including pain intensity, depression
   symptom severity, sleep, self-efficacy, and global impression of change,
   are also measured after treatment. Where possible, outcomes are
   collected via electronic health record extraction, with remaining
   measures collected via IVR calls to maintain blinding. Quantitative and
   qualitative process evaluation metrics will be collected to evaluate
   factors related to implementation. A budget impact analysis will be
   performed. Summary. This pragmatic trial compares the outcomes, cost,
   and implementation of two forms of CBT-CP as delivered in the real-world
   setting. Findings from the trial can be used to guide future policy and
   implementation efforts related to these interventions and their use in
   the health system. If one of the interventions emerges as superior,
   resources can be directed to this modality. If both treatments are
   effective, patient preferences and health care system factors will take
   precedence when making referrals. Implications of COVID-19 on treatment
   provision and trial outcomes are discussed.}},

   the tangle cobordism category to chain complexes. In particular, the hom
   set of our invariant with a particular non-compact Lagrangian associated
   to the trivial tangle is naturally isomorphic to the reduced Khovanov
   chain complex of the closure of the tangle. Our construction comes from
   the geometry of traceless SU(2) character varieties associated to

Abstract = {{Evidence in the literature suggests that traditional medicinal knowledge
   (TMK) among Indigenous populations is declining. This study focused on
   understanding influences underlying the perception of intergenerational
   erosion of TMK among Kenyan Purko Maasai. Methods included a combination
   of participant observation and in-depth interviews among 30
   participants. Using a political ecology framework, results indicate a
   number of sociocultural factors contributing to local perceptions of
   decline in TMK among younger generations. Shifts in land tenure and
   changes in locality, for example, impact transmission of knowledge.
   While younger generations described a strong desire to learn TMK, they
   were at a loss as to how to gain the knowledge. Our findings suggest
   that limited in-situ learning opportunities within the local environment
   is a leading factor resulting in perceptions of intergenerational
   erosion of knowledge. We conclude that, to ensure the transmission of
   this valuable cultural resource, a shift is needed in educational
   strategies, both at the school and community level.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic hyperglycemia and diabetes lead to impaired cardiac
   repolarization, K+ channel remodeling and increased arrhythmia risk.
   However, the exact signaling mechanism by which diabetic hyperglycemia
   regulates cardiac K+ channels remains elusive. Here, we show that acute
   hyperglycemia increases inward rectifier K+ current (I-K1), but reduces
   the amplitude and inactivation recovery time of the transient outward K+
   current (I-to) in mouse, rat, and rabbit myocytes. These changes were
   all critically dependent on intracellular O-GlcNAcylation. Additionally,
   I-K1 amplitude and I-to recovery effects (but not I-to amplitude) were
   prevented by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor
   autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide, CaMKII delta-knockout, and
   O-GlcNAc-resistant CaMKII delta-S280A knock-in. I-to reduction was
   prevented by inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) and NADPH oxidase 2
   (NOX2)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). In mouse models of chronic
   diabetes (streptozotocin, db/db, and high-fat diet), heart failure, and
   CaMKII delta overexpression, both I-to and I-K1 were reduced in line
   with the downregulated K+ channel expression. However, I-K1
   downregulation in diabetes was markedly attenuated in CaMKII
   delta-S280A. We conclude that acute hyperglycemia enhances I-K1 and I-to
   recovery via CaMKII delta-S280 O-GlcNAcylation, but reduces I-to
   amplitude via a NOX2-ROS-PKC pathway. Moreover, chronic hyperglycemia
   during diabetes and CaMKII activation downregulate K+ channel expression
   and function, which may further increase arrhythmia susceptibility.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims: Alteration in the insulin signaling could
   contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through
   metabolic or inflammatory processes, adipokines could affect insulin
   dysregulation. This study aimed to investigate whether there is a
   correlation between serum adiponectin level alteration and insulin
   resistance with the presence and severity of AD, compared to normal
   controls.
   Methods: This analytical observational study was conducted on 60
   non-overweight and non-diabetic participants who were assigned to AD
   patients (n = 34) and healthy volunteers (n = 26). The diagnosis and
   severity of dementia were evaluated by the same protocol, and the
   Mini-Mental Score Exam (MMSE) questionnaire was utilized to collect the
   data. Moreover, adiponectin concentration, fasting blood sugar, and
   plasma insulin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay. Furthermore, the homeostasis model assessment for insulin
   resistance (HOMA-IR) was utilized in this study.
   Results: The mean ages of the AD patients and control participants were
   71.35 and 70.46, respectively. In addition, the mean values of the serum
   adiponectin level of the participants were 9660 and 12,730 ng/mL in
   control and AD groups, respectively (P <= 0.05). Additionally, the
   insulin resistance (IR) was 2.90 and 5.10 in the control and AD groups,
   respectively (P <= 0.05). According to the results, there was a
   significant positive correlation between serum adiponectin level and
   HOMA-IR in the AD group; however, no significant correlation was
   observed between serum adiponectin level and MMSE score in this group.
   The MMSE score of AD patients significantly decreased by 1.2 times with
   an increase in each score of the IR (P <= 0.05).
   Conclusion: A significant direct positive correlation was observed
   between the serum adiponectin level and IR among the AD patients.
   However, a significant decrease in cognition levels was detected
   following an increase in IR scores of the AD patients. (C) 2020 European

Abstract = {{In this current work, a bio-inspired green approach has been followed to
   synthesize Ag nanoparticles (NPs), which were immobilized over reduced
   graphene oxide (rGO) as a suitable support. In the stepwise preparation
   of the bionanocomposite (rGO/Ag NPs) by using Menthapulegium flower
   extract, initially graphene oxide (GO) was reduced to rGO followed by in
   situ reduction of Ag+ ions to Ag NPs. In these reductions, different
   biomolecules such as, polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids and
   mild acids were employed as the natural reductant. The oxygenated
   functions in the aforementioned biomolecules, efficiently, assisted the
   capping and stabilizing the AgNPs. The as-synthesized nanocomposite was
   fully characterized using different techniques such as, UV-Vis
   spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDX)
   elemental mapping, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP). Diameter of the
   biosynthesized Ag NPs were found to be in the range of 20-25 nm. The
   constituent elements were found to be homogeneously dispersed as found
   from elemental mapping study. This novel prepared nano-composite showed
   excellent water dispersibility due to the hydrophilicity of biomolecules
   attached to them, which is essential criterion in heterogeneous
   catalysis. This composite was used as an effective catalyst in the
   reductive degradation of water contaminated by organic dyes such as
   methyl Orange (MO) and rhodamin B (RhB) using NaBH4 as reductive agent
   at room temperature. The progress of reduction was monitored by UV-Vis
   spectroscopy. Both the reactions followed pseudo-unimolecular kinetics
   and the corresponding rate constants were found being 0.098 s(-1) and
   0.096 s(-1) respectively. The material was significantly robust as
   justified by the leaching as well as hot-filtration tests and its
   reusability for several times without any appreciable loss in its
   activity. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This essay brings critical discourse on whiteness into conversation with
   African American satire to demonstrate how Colson Whitehead's The
   Underground Railroad (2016) engages in both traditional and postmodern
   forms of satire to trouble our assumptions about the function of
   historical fiction in a post-truth era. Whitehead satirizes various
   moments in American history to show how white power is maintained
   through a dialectic of fear. Whitehead's novel claims control over the
   white gaze by asserting a satirical black gaze, rendering established
   (white) history the subject of scrutiny. Through an engagement with W.
   E. B. Du Bois's ``The Souls of White Folk{''} (1920) and bell hooks's
   ``The Oppositional Gaze{''} (1992), I demonstrate how Whitehead utilizes
   satire to subvert this white gaze of history. When, in our contemporary
   post-truth moment, facts are ignored or repudiated-when reality looks
   disturbingly similar to ``fake news{''}-and when the US president is a
   former reality television star with a nostalgic desire to ``make America
   great again,{''} satire emerges as a way to throw the ridiculous into
   sharp, biting relief. The Underground Railroad exposes how an underlying
   (white) fear of black liberty and power contributes to the violence
   committed against black people throughout history, thereby demanding we
   take an oppositional look at American history in the ongoing project of
   emancipation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Plant extracts are effectively acting as the natural
   medicinal cocktail, non-side effective, efficacious, and freely
   available. The present study aimed to unveil the pharmacological and
   medicinal effects of Terminalia chebula plant extract in
   7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary carcinoma in Sprague
   Dawley rats. The plant extract obtained was subjected to in vivo
   antioxidant and anticancer studies in various concentrations after an
   analytical technique such as FTIR, GCMS, and HPLC-based chemo-profiling
   in Sprague Dawley rats.
   Results: Apart from the antiproliferative effect on breast cancer cell
   line (MCF-7) and normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10a), we have
   measured the changes in body weight, along with other tumor parameters
   such as tumor volume, tumor incidence, tumor weight, tumor burden, serum
   biochemical parameters, and histopathological findings of breast tissue.
   As the oxidative stress further enhances the development of cancer, the
   antioxidant property of the plant extract demonstrates its use against
   cancer treatment. One hundred fifty milligrams per milliliter (IC50 250
   mu g/mL) concentration of the ethanolic extract was vital for the
   proliferation of MCF-7 cell lines (Fig. 7a). Meanwhile, 300 mu g/mL
   (IC50 150 mu g/mL) was an effective dose to attain a maximum HDAC
   inhibition of 78\%. Also, the normal liver and kidney functioning
   revealed the non-toxicity nature of the plant.
   Conclusion: Terminalia chebula could be one of the effective naturally
   obtained anti-breast cancer medications. Isolation and characterization
   of individual bioactive compounds of T. chebula would be the future
   perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Efficiency and operational durability are crucial characteristics for
   the high-performance quantum-dots light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). In
   order to improve the efficiency and the stability of the QLEDs, we have
   inserted an inorganic Al2O3 interfacial modification layer (IML) next to
   the electron transport layer (ETL) using atomic layer deposition (ALD).
   We conducted a comparative analysis of two different positions of Al2O3
   IML inside the device, inserting IML before ETL and after ETL, to find
   an optimized structure for the efficient QLEDs. As a result, when Al2O3
   IML was located after ETL, reduction of oxygen vacancy in the ZnO layer
   was occurred due to the reaction of O-2 plasma reactant that used during
   the ALD process. It can have the effects of decreasing the exciton
   quenching phenomenon and balancing the charge injection. Therefore,
   improved device performances were observed, and the maximum luminance
   was 56 108 cd m(-2) when 1 nm Al2O3 IML was deposited after ZnO ETL.
   These results suggest Al2O3 IML deposition would provide a useful way to
   improve the performance of QLEDs.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Diabetes is the fourth cause of death globally. To date, there is not a
   practical, as well as an accurate sample for reflecting chronic glucose
   levels. We measured earwax glucose in 37 controls. Participants provided
   standard serum, glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and earwax samples at two
   time-points, one month apart. The specimens measured baseline fasting
   glucose, a follow-up postprandial glucose level and a between sample
   chronic glucose, calculated using the average level on the two
   occasions. The baseline earwax sample was obtained using a clinical
   method and the follow-up using a novel self-sampling earwax device. The
   earwax analytic time was significantly faster using the novel device, in
   comparison to the clinical use of the syringe. Earwax accurately
   reflected glucose at both assessments with stronger correlations than
   HbA(1c). Follow-up postprandial concentrations were more significant
   than their respective fasting baseline concentrations, reflecting
   differences in fasting and postprandial glycemia and more efficient
   standardization at follow up. Earwax demonstrated to be more predictable
   than HbA(1c) in reflecting systemic fasting, postprandial and long-term
   glucose levels, and to be less influenced by confounders. Earwax glucose
   measurements were approximately 60\% more predictable than HbA(1c) in
   reflecting glycemia over a month. The self-sampling device provided a
   sample that might accurately reflect chronic glycemia.}},

Abstract = {{The role and importance of military musicians changed and intensified in
   the late eighteenth century through two important processes. The first
   was the culture of display that took root in both the home-based army
   and units in the colonies. The second was the result of successive
   militia acts which effectively ensured that military units with bands
   would be systematically placed in every corner of the British Isles. It
   became evident that music as a component of military display served an
   important diplomatic purpose. Music performed in public spaces was heard
   by a population deeply sceptical of the army and with an essentially
   local sense of identity. The experience of the sight and sound of
   military music raised entirely new perceptions of nation and of the
   state as a benign power. Two important and related themes emerge here.
   The first is the historical process that led, almost accidentally, to a
   realization that music as part of military display had potential to
   influence populations across the country and in the colonies. The
   second, more challenging, theme concerns the nature of the evidence for
   this idea and how it is to be treated. It is an idea that is totally
   convincing if the experience of hearing and seeing military spectacle by
   the mass of the people can be shown to have had impact. What is the
   evidence of listening to music by those people at whom it was targeted,
   how robust is it and what can be made of it?}},

Title = {{Psychometric validation of an Assessment Questionnaire on the Perception

Abstract = {{Purpose. - Handicap evaluation in adults with acquired or progressive
   congenital visual toss allows for identification of the individual's
   specific needs and targeted therapy (medical, technical, rehabilitative
   and psychological). Currently, the subjective dimension of the handicap
   remains poorly explored in the field of visual loss. Our questionnaire
   aims to understand the whole of these subjective impacts. It differs
   from existing quality of life scales in ophthalmology in its approach
   centered on the process of adaptation, individual resources (technical,
   cognitive, psychic and environmental), and investigation of the
   perception of the handicap. The goal of the present study is to validate
   this questionnaire, which could be used in any adult with a visual
   handicap, regardless of the extent of the visual loss, its etiology, or
   the type of treatment or compensatory mechanisms.
   Materials and methods. - The Assessment Questionnaire on the Perception
   of and Adaptation to Visual Handicap in Adults (QUEPAHVA) is composed of
   28 items relating to perception of the visual impairment, its impact,
   and adaptive resources. They are divided into 3 subcategories:
   Perception of daily life and relationships (10 items), Perception of
   visual status and compensatory mechanisms (8 items), and Psychological
   impact of the visual handicap (10 items). The responses are graded on a
   Likert scale. Factor analysis and verification of psychometric qualities
   were performed based on the responses of 446 subjects. The
   discriminatory validity of the NEI-VFQ 25 was proven with 99 subjects.
   Reliability over time (mean interval between T1 and T2 =49.43 days) was
   measured in 31 subjects. Sensitivity to change between pre- and
   post-management (mean interval between T1 and T2 =410 days) was tested
   in 123 subjects.
   Results. - Internal consistency was very good for the global scale =
   .90) as well as for the 3 sub-dimensions (re = .86; a = .79; (I = .80).
   The discriminatory validity was satisfactory (r= .70). This result had
   to be interpreted as a function of the qualitative specificity of the
   questionnaire. The questionnaire enjoyed good reproducibility over time
   with regard to its total score and relatively satisfactory
   reproducibility with regard to its sub-dimensions. Sensitivity to change
   was very high and accounted for adaptations to the disability over time.
   Conclusion. - The QUEPAHVA displays good psychometric qualities. It
   constitutes a new means of evaluation. Its potential applications are
   many. It permits evaluation of the needs of the individual and
   adaptation of the protocol of care. Its use in institutions may support
   a step forward in the science of evaluation and continued improvement in
   quality of care. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is a dire need to engineer biologically robust constructs to meet
   the growing needs of 21st-century medical sector. The increasing
   (re)-emergence of human-health related pathogenic microbes has caused a
   havoc and serious challenge to health care services. In this context,
   herein, we report the development and characterization of various
   polymeric bio-composites with unique structural and functional
   attributes. For a said purpose, chitosan and graphene were used to
   engineer bio-composites, which were then functionalized by loading
   silver and platinum nanoparticles. A microwave-assisted approach was
   adopted to construct silver and platinum nanoparticles loaded
   graphene-based bio-composites. While, ``one-pot{''} synthesis approach
   was used to engineer silver and platinum nanoparticles loaded
   chitosan-based bio-composites. As developed bio-composites were
   designated as GO-Ag-S1 to GO-Ag-S5 (silver nanoparticles loaded
   graphene-based bio-composites), GO-Pt-P1 to GO-Pt-P5 (platinum
   nanoparticles loaded graphene-based bio-composites), CHI-Ag-S1 to
   CHI-Ag-S5 (silver nanoparticles loaded chitosan-based bio-composites),
   and CHI-Pt-P1 to CHI-Pt-P5 (platinum nanoparticles loaded chitosan-based
   bio-composites). Finally, the nanoparticles loaded bio-composites of
   graphene and chitosan were subjected to characterization via UV-Visible
   spectrophotometric analysis, percent loading efficiency (\%LE) analysis,
   Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, mechanical measurements,
   and antibacterial attributes. The UV-Visible spectrophotometric analysis
   revealed characteristic peaks appeared at the lambda(max) 420 nm and 266
   nm which belongs to the silver and platinum nanoparticles, respectively.
   The graphene-based bio-composites, i.e., GO-Ag-S3, GO-Ag-S4, and
   GO-Pt-P3 showed optimal \%LE of 88, 92, and 89\%, respectively. Whereas,
   CHI-Ag-S4, CHI-Pt-P3, and CHI-Pt-P4 bio-composites showed optimal \%LE
   of 94, 86, and 94\%, respectively. Two regions, i.e., (1) between
   3600-3100 cm and (2) between 1,800 and 1,000 cm(-1) in the FTIR spectra
   were found of particular interest. The FTIR profile exposed the
   available functional moieties at the surface of respective
   bio-composites. Variable mechanical attributes of silver and platinum
   nanoparticles loaded bio-composites were recorded from the stress-strain
   curves. All developed bio-composites showed bactericidal activities up
   to certain extent against both test strains. As compared to the initial
   bacterial cell count (control value, i.e., 1.5 x 10(8) CFU/mL), the
   bio-composites with higher \%LE showed almost complete inhibition, with
   a log reduction from 5 to 0, and bactericidal activities up to certain
   extent against both test strains, i.e., Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis),
   and Escherichia coli (E. coli). In conclusion, the notable structural,
   functional, mechanical and antimicrobial attributes suggest the
   biomedical potentialities of newly in-house engineered silver and
   platinum nanoparticles loaded graphene and chitosan-based
   bio-composites.}},

Abstract = {{The black bean is a legume widely consumed in Latin America, however its
   consumption has decreased significantly in recent decades. There is
   evidence that its consumption generates beneficial health effects due in
   part to the type of protein, resistant starches and polyphenols. Thus,
   their use in food formulation could impact health status. Therefore, the
   purpose of the present work was to evaluate the effects of the
   consumption of a bean protein concentrate (BPC) and a whole cooked bean
   flour (WCB) on body composition, glucose metabolism and energy
   expenditure in Wistar rats fed a control diet or high-fat diets with 5\%
   sucrose in the drinking water. With this aim, rats were fed the
   experimental diets for 10 weeks. The results showed that consumption of
   either BPC or WCB reduced weight gain and body fat despite the
   consumption of a high-fat diet. This change was associated with a
   significant increase in energy expenditure and the capacity to adapt
   fuel oxidation to fuel availability. As a result, rats fed a bean-based
   diet had lower circulating glucose and insulin concentrations and normal
   glucose tolerance, which was associated with decreased expression of
   lipogenic genes in the liver. These results suggest that the type of
   protein and bioactive compounds particularly phenolic and flavonoid
   compounds present in BPC are suitable to improve the formulations used
   in dietary strategies for subjects with obesity or type 2 diabetes. The
   addition of legumes to the diet of subjects with insulin resistance,
   including black beans, could improve their metabolic status.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of curcumin in
   combination with fenugreek soluble fiber (CUR + FEN) or fenugreek
   soluble fiber alone (FEN) on the neuromuscular fatigue threshold
   (PWCFT), peak oxygen consumption ((V) over doto(2)peak), and time to
   exhaustion (T-lim) on a graded exercise test (GXT), in untrained
   subjects. The PWCFT estimates the highest power output that can be
   maintained without evidence of neuromuscular fatigue. Forty-seven
   untrained, college-aged subjects were randomly assigned to one of 3
   supplementation groups; placebo (PLA, n515), CUR + FEN (500 mg.d(-1),
   n=18), or FEN (300 mg.d(-1), n=14). The subjects completed a maximal GXT
   on a cycle ergometer to determine the PWCFT, (V) over doto(2)peak, and
   T-lim before (PRE) and after (POST) 28 days of daily supplementation.
   Surface electromyographic signals-were recorded from a bipolar electrode
   arrangement on the vastus lateralis of the right leg during each test.
   Separate one-way analysis of covariances were used to determine if there
   were between-group differences for adjusted POST-PWCFT, POST-(V) over
   doto(2)peak, and POST-T-lim values, covaried for the respective PRE-test
   scores. The adjusted POST-PWCFT for the CUR + FEN group (mean +/- SD:
   196 +/- 58 W) was greater (p = 0.016) than the PLA group (168 +/- 49 W)
   but the FEN group (185 +/- 32 W) was not different from the CUR + FEN or
   PLA groups (p > 0.05). There were no differences for adjusted POST-(V)
   over doto(2)peak (p=0.612) or POST-T-lim (p=0.508) among the groups.
   These findings suggested curcumin combined with fenugreek soluble fiber
   might delay neuromuscular fatigue.}},

Title = {{Dangerous Times? A Routine Activities Examination of the Temporal
   Patterns of Sexual Offenses over Time}},
Journal = {{JUSTICE QUARTERLY}},
Abstract = {{Despite environmental criminologists emphasizing the role that both
   space and time play in the occurrence of crime, there is still only a
   small literature on the temporal rhythms of criminal behavior,
   especially those of sexual violence. Drawing from routine activities
   theory, this research uses circular statistics to investigate the
   temporal patterns of 2,260 sexual offenses from a Canadian police
   database at the seasonal-, monthly-, daily-, and hourly-levels, as well
   as their consistency over time. Findings suggest that there is a
   distinct temporal pattern when the unit of analysis is at the seasonal-,
   monthly-, and hourly-levels, but not at the daily-level. Furthermore,
   these temporal patterns are relatively consistent from year-to-year.
   These conclusions support the legitimacy of including a temporal element
   into current geographically-based sexual offender policies and
   practices. Pragmatically, these findings may also be used to better
   inform policing and situational crime prevention efforts to reduce the
   incidence of sexual crimes.}},

Title = {{Molecular signatures of sexual communication in the phlebotomine sand
   flies}},
Journal = {{PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Phlebotomine sand flies employ an elaborate system of pheromone
   communication wherein males produce pheromones that attracts other males
   to leks (thus acting as aggregation pheromone) and females to the
   lekking males (sex pheromone). In addition, the type of pheromone
   produced varies among populations. Despite the numerous studies on sand
   fly chemical communication, little is known of their chemosensory
   genome. Chemoreceptors interact with chemicals in an organism's
   environment to elicit essential behaviors such as the identification of
   suitable mates and food sources, thus, they play important roles during
   adaptation and speciation. Major chemoreceptor gene families, odorant
   receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs) and ionotropic receptors
   (IRs) together detect and discriminate the chemical landscape. Here, we
   annotated the chemoreceptor repertoire in the genomes of Lutzomyia
   longipalpis and Phlebotomus papatasi, major phlebotomine vectors in the
   New World and Old World, respectively. Comparison with other sequenced
   Diptera revealed a large and unique expansion where over 80\% of the
   similar to 140 ORs belong to a single, taxonomically restricted clade.
   We next conducted comprehensive analysis of the chemoreceptors in 63 Lu.
   longipalpis individuals from four different locations in Brazil
   representing allopatric and sympatric populations and three
   sex-aggregation pheromone types (chemotypes). Population structure based
   on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene copy number in the
   chemoreceptors corresponded with their putative chemotypes, and
   corroborate previous studies that identified multiple populations. Our
   work provides genomic insights into the underlying behavioral evolution
   of sexual communication in the L. longipalpis species complex in Brazil,
   and highlights the importance of accounting for the ongoing speciation
   in central and South American Lutzomyia that could have important
   implications for vectorial capacity.
   Author summary
   Phlebotomine sand flies are the primary vectors of Leishmania parasites,
   the causative agents of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. Due to the
   lack of vaccines, control of leishmaniasis relies upon reducing human
   exposure to sand flies. Sand flies produce sex-aggregation pheromones
   that elicit robust olfactory behaviors, and the molecular targets for
   pheromone detection remain unknown. We identified chemoreceptors in the
   genomes of L. longipalpis and P. papatasi, and used these gene models to
   explore chemoreceptor evolution in 63 L. longipalpis individuals
   representing different pheromone types. These analyses identified
   genomic loci underlying chemosensory behavior in sand flies. This paves
   the way for understanding the sand fly species diversity at the
   molecular level, and functional characterization of these candidate
   genes will isolate and identify chemostimuli that can directly be tested
   as potential attractants for odor baited traps.}},

Title = {{Dry sliding wear behaviour of Al6061-5\%SiC-TiB2 hybrid metal matrix
   composites synthesized by stir casting process}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Functionally graded Al6061-SiC composites are widely used in the
   manufacturing of bearing surfaces, bushes, gears, cylinder liners,
   pistons and camshafts. However, due to the poor density and higher level
   of porosity, the usages of Al6061-SiC composites are limited. The
   Purpose of the study is to improve the wear behaviour of the Al606l-SiC
   composites to widen the engineering application of the Al6061 alloy. In
   this present work, an effort is made to examine the dry sliding wear
   characteristics on a newly developed hybrid metal matrix composite of
   Al6061\%-5\%SiC-x TiB2 (x = 2\%, 4\%, 6\%, 8\% and 10 wt\%) fabricated
   by stir casting route. The Wear Rate and Coefficient of Friction were
   examined using a Pin-on-Disc tribometer at various dry sliding
   conditions. The results of the experimental studies revealed that with
   the addition of secondary hard ceramic TiB2 particles, the wear
   behaviour was found to be significantly improved on the hybrid composite
   due to the new formation of Mechanically Mixed Layer (Fe2O3 layer). The
   Coefficient of Friction showed a decreasing trend in the case of varying
   loads and sliding distances. Conversely, the COF exhibit an increasing
   trend concerning the sliding velocities. The results have shown that the
   highly concentrated Al6061-5\%SiC-10\%TiB2 hybrid composite achieved the
   least COF values of 0.26, 0.31 and 0.29 at higher applied load (40N),
   sliding distance (2000 m) and sliding velocity (2.61 m s(-1)) conditions
   respectively. The worn surface of the hybrid composite indicates fine
   grooves with minimal abrasion.}},

Journal = {{ARTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{We analyze three environmentally conscious works that are concerned with
   the state of Finnish forests: the documentary film Metsan tarina/Tale of
   a Forest (2012), the book with the same name (2013) and the series of
   short documentaries Tarinoita metsasta/Tales from the Forest (2013). By
   combining methods from arts research and ecology, we ask how the
   narratives adapt material from nature photography. The film and book
   present mythic stories and old Finnish beliefs about forests. They also
   contain references to cultural memory. Additionally, the biodiversity on
   display reflects a conventional practice to exhibit large or charismatic
   species. However, the ecological message remains only implicit,
   expressed through aesthetic choices rather than information about
   natural processes. Overall, we suggest that adaptation in these
   narratives can be understood as an artistic process of recycling and
   referencing and as a way to reconnect with cultural memory and nature.
   As such, it can enhance relationships with nature and awareness of
   conservation needs. However, we ask whether the past-oriented strategy
   is a politically effective way to activate a connection with nature in
   modern Finland, where discussions about environmental problems are
   closely connected to heated debates about forestry.}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   Active therapeutic options in advanced sarcomas, able to induce durable
   objective responses, are scarce beyond first line. New strategies for
   disease and symptomatic control are thus needed. Our aim was to analyze
   the activity of the combination of trabectedin and palliative
   radiotherapy in the real-life setting, in patients with pretreated
   metastatic sarcoma. Our findings on 40 pretreated metastatic soft-tissue
   sarcoma patients, in terms of objective responses (overall response rate
   by RECIST of 32.5\%) and outcome (median progression-free survival of
   7.5 months and median overall survival of 23.5 months), confirm the
   activity of this regimen, which is a valuable option to consider,
   especially in patients in which a dimensional response could help for
   symptomatic control.
   Symptomatic control and tumoral shrinkage is an unmet need in advanced
   soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients beyond first-line. The combination of
   trabectedin and radiotherapy showed activity in a recently reported
   clinical trial in this setting. This retrospective series aims to
   analyze our experience with the same regimen in the real-life setting.
   We retrospectively reviewed advanced sarcoma patients treated with
   trabectedin concomitantly with radiotherapy with palliative intent.
   Growth-modulation index (GMI) was calculated as a surrogate of efficacy.
   Forty metastatic patients were analyzed. According to RECIST, there was
   one (2.5\%) complete response, 12 (30\%) partial responses, 18 (45\%)
   disease stabilizations, and nine (22.5\%) progressions. After a median
   follow-up of 15 months (range 2-38), median progression-free survival
   (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7.5 months (95\% CI 2.8-12.2) and
   23.5 months (95\% CI 1.1-45.8), respectively. Median GMI was 1.42 (range
   0.19-23.76), and in 16 (53\%) patients, it was >1.33. In patients with
   GMI >1.33, median OS was significantly longer than in those with GMI
   0-1.33 (median OS 52.1 months (95\% CI not reached) vs. 8.9 months (95\%
   CI 6.3-11.6), p = 0.028). The combination of trabectedin plus
   radiotherapy is an active therapeutic option in patients with advanced
   STS, especially when tumor shrinkage for symptomatic relief is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Filamin-A (FLNA) is one of the adaptor proteins binding to
   both integrin beta chain and actin filament. Several kind of mutation in
   human FLNA gene were observed in MelnickNeedles syndrome (MNS). However,
   the role of FLNA in tooth formation is still unknown. Matrials and
   methods: We analyzed the tissue expression of FLNA during tooth
   development using immunostaining. The role of FLNA in cell migration was
   analyzed using a scratch assay. In addition, we analyzed the phenotype
   of teeth in patients with Mernick-Needles syndrome caused by FLNA gene
   abnormalities. Results: FLNA expressed in inner and outer enamel
   epithelium in mouse tooth germ and also expressed in cervical region of
   dental epithelium. In postnatal stage, FLNA expressed in ameloblast and
   odontoblast layers. In rat dental epithelium cell line SF2, FLNA is
   localized at the boundary between cells and co-localized with the
   terminal region of F-actin filament. shRNA-FLNA transfected cells showed
   delayed cell migration and scratch closure compared with control cells.
   Analysis of actin fiber movement by time-lapse confocal microscopy
   showed slower fiber movement in shRNA-FLNA over expressing SF2 cells.
   Novel mutation in FLNA gene was observed in MNS with tooth anormaly.
   This patient showed tooth agenesis and short root in both primary and
   permanent dentition with thin enamel. Conclusion: Taken together, these
   results suggest that filamin-A is play a key role for dental epithelium
   migration and root formation. (c) 2020 Japanese Society of Pediatric

Title = {{A carbon price floor in the reformed EU ETS: Design matters!}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{147}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite the reform of the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS),
   discussions about complementing it with a carbon price floor (CPF) are
   ongoing. This paper analyzes the effect of a European CPF in the
   reformed EU ETS using a Hotelling model of the EU ETS, amended by the
   market stability reserve (MSR), and the cancellation mechanism. Two CPF
   designs are compared: (1) a buyback program and (2) a top-up tax. The
   buyback program sets a minimum price for the allowances from the
   implementation year onwards. After the announcement, firms anticipate
   the CPF, which immediately increases the carbon price to the discounted
   CPF level. Therefore, firms emit less and bank more allowances, leading
   to more intake into the MSR, and more cancellation of allowances. The
   top-up tax imposes a tax on emissions, which enhances the market price
   of allowances to the CPF level from the implementation year onwards.
   Firms increase their short-run emissions in anticipation of the upcoming
   tax. Only after the implementation year firms start to lower their
   emissions. Thus, the effect on aggregate cancellation is ambiguous.
   Despite being equivalent in a static setting, the design choice for the
   CPF matters in a dynamic context, such as the EU ETS.}},

Title = {{Anthropogenic Aerosols Dominate Forced Multidecadal Sahel Precipitation
   Change through Distinct Atmospheric and Oceanic Drivers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{10187-10204}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Sahel precipitation has undergone substantial multidecadal time scale
   changes during the twentieth century that have had severe impacts on the
   region's population. Using initial-condition large ensembles (LE) of
   coupled general circulation model (GCM) simulations from two
   institutions, forced multidecadal variability is found in which Sahel
   precipitation declines from the 1950s to 1970s and then recovers from
   the 1970s to 2000s. This forced variability has similar timing to, but
   considerably smaller magnitude than, observed Sahel precipitation
   variability. Isolating the response using single forcing simulations
   within the LEs reveals that anthropogenic aerosols (AA) are the primary
   driver of this forced variability. The roles of the direct-atmospheric
   and the ocean-mediated atmospheric responses to AA forcing are
   determined with the atmosphere-land GCM (AGCM) components of the LE
   coupled GCMs. The direct-atmospheric response arises from changes to
   aerosol and precursor emissions with unchanged oceanic boundary
   conditions while the ocean-mediated response arises from changes to
   AA-forced sea surface temperatures and sea ice concentrations diagnosed
   from the AA forced LE. In the AGCMs studied here, the direct-atmospheric
   response dominates the AA-forced 1970s 2 1950s Sahel drying. On the
   other hand, the 2000s 2 1970s wetting is mainly driven by the
   ocean-mediated effect, with some direct atmospheric contribution.
   Although the responses show differences, there is qualitative agreement
   between the AGCMs regarding the roles of the direct-atmospheric and
   ocean-mediated responses. Since these effects often compete and show
   nonlinearity, the model dependence of these effects and their role in
   the net aerosol-forced response of Sahel precipitation need to be
   carefully accounted for in future model analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Co-participation in physical activity may be important for helping
   families with young children meet physical activity recommendations.
   Yet, little is known about what families perceive to be the benefits,
   barriers and facilitators of co-participation. This study explored (i)
   parents' perceptions about physical activity and possible benefits of
   family-based co-participation in physical activity, (ii) their perceived
   facilitators and barriers to co-participation and (iii) their
   recommendations for improving co-participation within their community.
   Fifteen parents (14 mothers, 1 father) of 2- to 4-year-old children
   residing in Western Sydney, Australia, participated in one-on-one
   interviews between September 2016 and January 2017. Interviews were
   audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Four main themes and seven
   sub-themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the interview data.
   When parents were asked to reflect on their understanding of physical
   activity, they discussed a range of well-known activities (e.g. active
   play, active transport) and also reported `anything but screen time'.
   The major benefits parents reported about co-participation were spending
   quality time together, improving children's general health and
   well-being and the development of physical skills. Social (e.g. social
   networks, negative stereotypes) and environmental (e.g. home space,
   neighbourhood design, shading) facilitators and barriers were
   identified, yet their impact on co-participation often varied depending
   on the presence (or lack thereof) of other factors in the physical or
   social environment. Key recommendations suggested by parents included
   improvements to home outdoor spaces, neighbourhood design and play
   spaces and community services.}},

Abstract = {{How can official survey data be prepared for virtual worlds? For small
   and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), these steps can still be very
   time-consuming. This article is vital for these companies, since its aim
   is to create a practical open source solution for everyday work based on
   up-to-date research. Developing integrated Virtual Reality applications
   for geographic information systems VRGIS today, we are facing following
   problems: georeferenced data are currently available in many different
   data formats. Often there is a lack of common standards,
   user-friendliness and possibilities for process automation, just as the
   correct georeferencing in virtual worlds is an open field. It is shown
   that open source platforms can offer very interesting, practical and
   economical solutions. Following the method of structured and focused
   comparison according to George and Bennett, fourteen current software
   solutions are presented as examples. The applications can be classified
   according to the taxonomy of Anthes et al., with regard to output
   devices and software development. A comprehensive networking matrix for
   applied interactive technologies will be introduced for SME partner
   searches in related software developments. The evaluation criteria of
   integration capability, operability without programming knowledge and
   cost-effectiveness allow for a subsequent discussion and evaluation.
   Finally, this paper presents a simple proprietary and open-source
   software solution for small and medium-sized enterprises. Map
   illustrations and methods for georeferencing are explained. Exemplary
   digital products and data formats are presented at the Landesamt fur
   Digitalisierung, Breitband und Vermessung (LDBV) in Bavaria.}},

Title = {{It's not all about the size - characteristics and risk factors for
   malignancy of mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) of the pancreas are rare
   mucin-producing cystic tumors. As they harbor malignant potential,
   surgical resection is frequently performed. Current guidelines recommend
   surgery in asymptomatic patients only for MCN exceeding 4 cm. The aim of
   this study was to identify radiological and clinical risk factors for
   malignancy in a single-center cohort of MCN.
   Methods: All resected MCN from a single high-volume center between 2004
   and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patient characteristics,
   preoperative findings, histopathological results, and data on the
   postoperative course were recorded. Variables associated with malignancy
   were evaluated using chi(2) and Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curves were used to model predictive capabilities
   of preoperative tumor marker levels. Furthermore uni- and multivariate
   logistic regression analysis were performed for binary variables.
   Survival time was plotted as Kaplan-Meier curves and evaluated by
   log-rank test.
   Results: A total of 63 patients were induded. Median age was 62 years;
   51 (81.0\%) of them were women; median tumor size was 3.5 cm (range,
   0.5-18.5); 16 (25.4\%) of tumors harbored invasive carcinoma and 13
   presented intraepithelial dysplasia (20.6\%); 7 (43.8\%) invasive
   carcinomas were smaller than 4 cm. All malignant MCN were radiologically
   suspected of malignancy (calcifications, mural nodules, or wall
   thickness) preoperatively. Elevated levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9
   (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were strongly associated
   with malignancy (odd's ratio 33.600; 7.000-161.270); P<0.001 and odd's
   ratio 19.250; 3.370-109.970; P<0.001). Other factors associated with
   malignancy were preoperative weight lass (P=0.015) and higher age
   (P=0.048). Tumor size, abdominal or back pain or jaundice showed no
   significant correlation to malignancy in our cohort.
   Conclusions: Malignant potential of MCN should not be underestimated and
   a close clinical and radiological follow-up is mandatory- in all
   suspected cases. This is especially important for small lesions. Risk
   assessment should not rely only on tumor size but consider all clinical,
   radiological and laboratory findings of each case. Follow-up should be
   performed by experienced surgeons and radiologists in high volume
   centers for pancreatic surgery. Surgery should be performed in all cases
   in which malignancy is suspected.}},

Abstract = {{Coherence relations are often assumed to hold between clauses, but

   restrictive RCs can indeed play a role at the discourse level and should
   not categorically be excluded from receiving discourse segment status in
   discourse annotation practices. At the same time, the studies provide
   new insights into implicit causality verb biases, specifically about
   next-mention biases in concessive coherence relations, and expectations

Title = {{Maximal Walking Distance in Persons with a Lower Limb Amputation}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The distance one can walk at a time could be considered an important
   functional outcome in people with a lower limb amputation. In clinical
   practice, walking distance in daily life is based on self-report (SIGAM
   mobility grade (Special Interest Group in Amputee Medicine)), which is
   known to overestimate physical activity. The aim of this study was to
   assess the number of consecutive steps and walking bouts in persons with
   a lower limb amputation, using an accelerometer sensor. The number of
   consecutive steps was related to their SIGAM mobility grade and to the
   consecutive steps of age-matched controls in daily life. Twenty subjects
   with a lower limb amputation and ten age-matched controls participated
   in the experiment for two consecutive days, in their own environment.
   Maximal number of consecutive steps and walking bouts were obtained by
   two accelerometers in the left and right trouser pocket, and one
   accelerometer on the sternum. In addition, the SIGAM mobility grade was
   determined and the 10 m walking test (10 MWT) was performed. The maximal
   number of consecutive steps and walking bouts were significantly smaller
   in persons with a lower limb amputation, compared to the control group
   (p < 0.001). Only 4 of the 20 persons with a lower limb amputation had a
   maximal number of consecutive steps in the range of the control group.
   Although the maximal covered distance was moderately correlated with the
   SIGAM mobility grade in participants with an amputation (r = 0.61), for
   6 of them, the SIGAM mobility grade did not match with the maximal
   covered distance. The current study indicated that mobility was highly
   affected in most persons with an amputation and that the SIGAM mobility
   grade did not reflect what persons with a lower limb amputation actually
   do in daily life. Therefore, objective assessment of the maximal number
   of consecutive steps of maximal covered distance is recommended for
   clinical treatment.}},

Title = {{The effect of social feedback from peers on adolescent cognitive control}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{12-20}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Social feedback can influence cognitive control during
   adolescence, particularly if provided by peers. The main aim of this
   study was to investigate if feedback given by liked or disliked peers
   differentially influenced adolescents' cognitive control. The second aim
   was to investigate if these effects could be linked to the participants'
   social embeddedness in their classroom.
   Methods: A personalized incentive go/no-go task was administered to 45
   early adolescents (M = 11.6 years, 25 male) and 68 late adolescents (M =
   16.7, 38 male) in the Netherlands. Feedback was given after no-go trials
   in two social feedback conditions (displaying a picture of a real liked
   or disliked classmate) and in a non-social control condition.
   Results: Performance on the task significantly improved with age. We
   found no differences between conditions in cognitive control, as
   measured by d-prime. However, analysis of task speed revealed slower
   reaction times during the liked peer condition as compared to the
   disliked peer and the control condition, potentially suggesting that
   participants responded more cautiously, or alternatively that
   participants were more distracted. These effects did not differ between
   age groups. Participants' differences in task performance were not
   reflected in their social embeddedness in the classroom.
   Conclusions: This study shows that the same kind of social feedback can
   have different effects on adolescent behaviour depending on the peer
   delivering the feedback. It demonstrates the importance of studying the
   effects of real life social environments to better understand and
   utilize their impact on adolescent development.}},

Abstract = {{Fasting older broiler chickens (>7 d of age) enlarges the intestinal
   tight junction (TJ) pore size, resulting in high paracellular intestinal
   permeability. Broiler chickens often do not receive feed and water
   (nutrition) directly after hatch, which may result in fasting up to 72 h
   of age. Whether perinatal fasting affects intestinal permeability is
   minimally studied. We therefore investigated whether delayed access to
   nutrition after hatch increases intestinal permeability, compared with
   broilers receiving early access to nutrition. Therefore, 432 hatched
   broilers received nutrition 72 h after hatch (delayed nutrition {[}DN])
   or directly after hatch (early nutrition {[}EN]) and were reared under
   similar conditions until 14 d of age. Two hours after application of an
   oral pulse dose (3.85 mg) of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (4000
   Da) at 4, 10, and 14 d of age, blood plasma concentrations of the marker
   were measured in 24 to 36 broilers per treatment and time Marker
   concentration in did not differ between DN and EN broilers at any age.
   The villus width measured in at least 8 broilers per treatment was
   smaller in DN than in EN broilers at 4 d for both the ileum (92 +/- 3 mm
   vs. 121 +/- 4; P < 0.001) and colon (100 +/- 3 vs. 120 +/- 4; P < 0.01).
   Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that the expression of TJ protein
   claudin 3 in the ceca was elevated in DN, compared with EN broilers at 4
   d of age, whereas that of zonula occludens 1 in the ileum was reduced.
   Expression of host defense-related genes was reduced in DN, compared
   with EN broilers, in the ileum (cyclo-oxygenase 2, mucin 2) and ceca
   (interleukin 1b , cyclo-oxygenase 2). We conclude that 72-hour DN
   reduced the BW up to 14 d of age, coinciding with transient effects on
   the villus width in the ileum and colon, and divergent expression of
   genes involved in TJ formation and host defense. These effects likely
   reflect the delayed onset of intestinal and immune development in DN,
   compared with EN broilers, while DN does not fundamentally alter
   intestinal permeability.}},

Abstract = {{Proper segregation during meiosis requires that homologs be connected by
   the combination of crossovers and sister chromatid cohesion. To generate
   crossovers, numerous double-strand breaks (DSBs) are introduced
   throughout the genome by the conserved Spo11 endonuclease. DSB formation
   and its repair are then highly regulated to ensure that homologous
   chromosomes contain at least one crossover and no DSBs remain prior to
   meiosis I segregation. The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a
   meiosis-specific structure formed between homologous chromosomes during
   prophase that promotes DSB formation and biases repair of DSBs to
   homologs over sister chromatids. Synapsis occurs when a particular
   recombination pathway is successful in establishing stable interhomolog
   connections. In this issue of Genes \& Development, Mu and colleagues
   (pp. 1605-1618) show that SC formation between individual chromosomes
   provides the feedback to downregulate Spo11 activity, thereby revealing
   an additional function for the SC.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts on battery cell ageing from high current operation are
   investigated using commercial cells. This study utilised two tests-(i)
   to establish the maximum current limits before cell failure and (ii)
   applying this maximum current until cell failure. Testing was performed
   to determine how far cycling parameters could progress beyond the
   manufacturer's recommendations. Current fluxes were increased up to 100
   C cycling conditions without the cell undergoing catastrophic failure.
   Charge and discharge current capabilities were possible at magnitudes of
   1.38 and 4.4 times, respectively, more than that specified by the
   manufacturer's claims. The increased current was used for longer term
   cycling tests to 500 cycles and the resulting capacity loss and
   resistance increase was dominated by thermal fatigue of the electrodes.
   This work shows that there is a discrepancy between manufacturer-stated
   current limits and actual current limits of the cell, before the cell
   undergoes catastrophic failure. This presumably is based on
   manufacturer-defined performance and lifetime criteria, as well as
   prioritised safety factors. For certain applications, e.g., where high
   performance is needed, this gap may not be suitable; this paper shows
   how this gap could be narrowed for these applications using the testing
   described herein.}},

Title = {{ATOMIUM: A high-resolution view on the highly asymmetric wind of the AGB

Abstract = {{The nebular circumstellar environments of cool evolved stars are known
   to harbour a rich morphological complexity of gaseous structures on
   different length scales. A large part of these density structures are
   thought to be brought about by the interaction of the stellar wind with
   a close companion. The S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star pi
   (1)Gruis, which has a known companion at similar to 440 au and is
   thought to harbour a second, closer-by (< 10 au) companion, was observed
   with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array as part of the
   ATOMIUM Large programme. In this work, the brightest CO, SiO, and HCN
   molecular line transitions are analysed. The continuum map shows two
   maxima, separated by 0.04<double prime> (6 au). The CO data
   unambiguously reveal that pi (1)Gru's circumstellar environment harbours
   an inclined, radially outflowing, equatorial density enhancement. It
   contains a spiral structure at an angle of similar to 38 +/- 3 degrees
   with the line-of-sight. The HCN emission in the inner wind reveals a
   clockwise spiral, with a dynamical crossing time of the spiral arms
   consistent with a companion at a distance of 0.04 `' from the AGB star,
   which is in agreement with the position of the secondary continuum peak.
   The inner wind dynamics imply a large acceleration region, consistent
   with a beta-law power of similar to 6. The CO emission suggests that the
   spiral is approximately Archimedean within 5 `', beyond which this trend
   breaks down as the succession of the spiral arms becomes less periodic.
   The SiO emission at scales smaller than 0.5 `' exhibits signatures of
   gas in rotation, which is found to fit the expected behaviour of gas in
   the wind-companion interaction zone. An investigation of SiO maser
   emission reveals what could be a stream of gas accelerating from the
   surface of the AGB star to the companion. Using these dynamics, we have
   tentatively derived an upper limit on the companion mass to be similar
   to 1.1 M-circle dot.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops a novel radial basis function (RBF) neural network
   (NN) minimal learning backstepping control law for active suspension
   systems represented by nonlinear dynamics with additive stochastic terms
   and practical hydraulic actuator saturation. The suggested approach is
   equipped with an adaptive mechanism to cope with the mismatched
   uncertainties and a proper adaptation law is designed through the
   so-called minimal learning and the command filter techniques. By
   utilizing the concept of the bounded-in-probability Lyapunov stability,
   the backstepping controller is resilient dealing with stochastic
   disturbances arisen form un-modeled dynamics of active suspension
   systems. Moreover, the mean-value theorem is considered for handling the
   practical issue of the hydraulic actuation saturation issue. The

Abstract = {{In this study, the engineering design of the proposed single family
   house project was carried out using the well-known architectural program
   called the Revit that provides a Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   tool to analyse the falling solar radiation on the specified location.
   Based on BIM, regions with abundant solar radiation were chosen for the
   purpose of installing the PV system and exploiting them in energy
   production. A simulation of a 6.96 KWh grid-connected rooftop PV system
   was performed by using PVsyst and PV{*}SOL software. A 3D single family
   house that was proposed by the municipality of the Turkish city of
   Elazig was designed and simulated using PVsyst and PV{*}SOL software
   based on BIM. Comparison and evaluation were carried out for the annual
   energy yield, performance ratio, specific production and energy feed
   into the grid of the PV system from each software. It has been shown
   that very similar results are obtained from the simulations of these
   softwares.}},

Abstract = {{Parameter constancy is a fundamental issue for empirical models to be

   time series models. The paper deals with the development of state space
   models with the weather as exogenous input for sugarcane yield
   prediction in Kurukshetra, Panipat, and Yamunanagar districts of
   Haryana. The state space models with weather as exogenous input using
   different types of growth trends viz., polynomial splines of order-1, 2,
   and 3 have been developed. The growth trend represented by polynomial
   splines of order-2 with the weather as exogenous input was selected as
   the best-suited model for sugarcane yield prediction in all the three

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background To prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), strict control of person-to-person
   transmission is essential. Family transmission is the most common route
   of transmission; however, family transmission patterns and outcomes are
   not well understood.
   Methods We enrolled confirmed cases discharged from Wuhan Zhuankou
   Fangcang Shelter Hospital from February 17, 2020 to March 8, 2020 along
   with the family members they had contact with, to evaluate baseline
   characteristics, family transmission patterns and outcomes. The
   follow-up period lasted until May 8, 2020.
   Results This study evaluated 369 participants, which included 100
   patients admitted to the shelter hospital and the family members they
   had contact with. Family transmission occurred in 62\% of house-hold,
   with 190 cases confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. There were eight
   patterns of family transmission, and spousal transmission (44/83,
   53.0\%) was the most common pattern, especially in the middle-age
   generation group (35/83, 42.2\%). The homes of the families in which all
   members were infected had a smaller per capita area than those of other
   families (29.1 +/- 11.89 cm(2) vs 41.0 +/- 19.70 cm(2), respec-tively, P
   = 0.037), and the per capita area was negatively associated with the
   number of infected family members (R = -0.097, P= 0.048). Of the 190
   confirmed cases, the 113 mild or moderate cases were monitored in
   fangcang (including Wuhan Zhuankou Fangcang and other fangcang), and the
   59 severe cases were treated at designated hospitals. By the end of
   follow-up, 185 patients recovered and returned home after completing at
   least 14 days of isolation at the community quarantine center, four died
   in hospitals, and one died at home before hospitalization.
   Interestingly, four patients had positive nucleic acid test results
   after previous negative results, though none of these patients were
   rehospitalized, and none of their close contacts reported an infection.
   Conclusions Our data found eight family transmission patterns, of which
   spousal transmission was the most common. Some patients were also found
   to have positive test results during follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work has indicated that canine parvovirus (CPV) prevalence in
   the Central Texas region may follow yearly, periodic patterns. The peak
   in CPV infection rates occurs during the summer months of May and June,
   marking a distinct ``CPV season{''}. We hypothesized that human activity
   contributes to these seasonal changes in CPV infections. The COVID-19
   pandemic resulted in drastic changes in human behavior which happened to
   synchronize with the CPV season in Central Texas, providing a unique
   opportunity with which to assess whether these society-level behavioral
   changes result in appreciable changes in CPV patient populations in the
   largest CPV treatment facility in Texas. In this work, we examine the
   population of CPV-infected patients at a large, dedicated CPV treatment
   clinic in Texas (having treated more than 5000 CPV-positive dogs in the
   last decade) and demonstrate that societal-behavioral changes due to
   COVID-19 were associated with a drastic reduction in CPV infections.
   This reduction occurred precisely when CPV season would typically begin,
   during the period immediately following state-wide ``reopening{''} of
   business and facilities, resulting in a change in the typical CPV season
   when compared with previous years. These results provide evidence that
   changes in human activity may, in some way, contribute to changes in
   rates of CPV infection in the Central Texas region.}},

Title = {{Development of Sensitive Droplet Digital PCR Assays for Detecting
   Urinary TERT Promoter Mutations as Non-Invasive Biomarkers for Detection
   of Urothelial Cancer}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   The gold standard method for the diagnosis of bladder cancer (BC) is the
   invasive and expensive cystoscopy. Telomerase reverse transcriptase
   (TERT) promoter mutations occur frequently (60-90\%) in BC. In this
   study, we developed highly sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays
   for detecting low-allelic fraction TERT promoter mutations (C228T,
   C228A, CC242-243TT and C250T) in urinary cell-free and/or cell pellet
   DNA of BC patients and compared their performance with our previously
   established NGS-based assay (UroMuTERT) in two independent case-control
   studies: DIAGURO (n = 89 cases and n = 92 controls) and IPO-PORTO (n =
   49 cases and n = 50 controls). The sensitivity and specificity of the
   ddPCR assays in detecting TERT promoter mutations in BC cases and
   controls were very high and comparable to the UroMuTERT assay. However,
   the technical and analytical simplicity of the ddPCR assays make them
   suitable candidates for clinical implementation.
   Somatic mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)
   promoter regions are frequent events in urothelial cancer (UC) and their
   detection in urine (supernatant cell-free DNA or DNA from exfoliated
   cells) could serve as putative non-invasive biomarkers for UC detection
   and monitoring. However, detecting these tumor-borne mutations in urine
   requires highly sensitive methods, capable of measuring low-level
   mutations. In this study, we developed sensitive droplet digital PCR
   (ddPCR) assays for detecting TERT promoter mutations (C228T, C228A,
   CC242-243TT, and C250T). We tested the C228T and C250T ddPCR assays on
   all samples with sufficient quantity of urinary DNA (urine supernatant
   cell-free DNA (US cfDNA) or urine pellet cellular DNA (UP cellDNA)) from
   the DIAGURO (n = 89/93 cases and n = 92/94 controls) and from the
   IPO-PORTO (n = 49/50 cases and n = 50/50 controls) series that were
   previously screened with the UroMuTERT assay and compared the
   performance of the two approaches. In the DIAGURO series, the
   sensitivity and specificity of the ddPCR assays for detecting UC using
   either US cfDNA or UP cellDNA were 86.8\% and 92.4\%. The sensitivity
   was slightly higher than that of the UroMuTERT assay in the IPO-PORTO
   series (67.4\% vs. 65.3\%, respectively), but not in the DIAGURO series
   (86.8\% vs. 90.7\%). The specificity was 100\% in the IPO-PORTO controls
   for both the UroMuTERT and ddPCR assays, whereas in the DIAGURO series,
   the specificity dropped for ddPCR (92.4\% versus 95.6\%). Overall, an
   almost perfect agreement between the two methods was observed for both
   US cfDNA (n = 164; kappa coefficient of 0.91) and UP cellDNA (n = 280;
   kappa coefficient of 0.94). In a large independent series of serial
   urine samples from DIAGURO follow-up BC cases (n = 394), the agreement
   between ddPCR and UroMuTERT was (i) strong (kappa coefficient of 0.87),
   regardless of urine DNA types (kappa coefficient 0.89 for US cfDNA and
   0.85 for UP cellDNA), (ii) the highest for samples with mutant allelic
   fractions (MAFs) > 2\% (kappa coefficient of 0.99) and (iii) only
   minimal for the samples with the lowest MAFs (< 0.5\%; kappa coefficient
   0.32). Altogether, our results indicate that the two methods (ddPCR and
   UroMuTERT) for detecting urinary TERT promoter mutations are comparable
   and that the discrepancies relate to the detection of low-allelic
   fraction mutations. The simplicity of the ddPCR assays makes them
   suitable for implementation in clinical settings.}},

   (PVP) stabilized nanoparticles (NPs) of various novel metals (Pt, Pd,
   Ru, Rh, Ag, and Au) with an average diameter of <2 nm. In this method,
   the use of microfluidic mixture provided a homogenous mixing of the
   metal precursors and reducing agent nearly at the molecular level, that
   yield monodispersed sub-nanosize NPs. Core diameters of the produced NPs
   determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), were 1.3 +/- 0.3,
   1.6 +/- 0.3, 1.3 +/- 0.2, 1.7 +/- 0.4, 1.9 +/- 0.4 and 1.2 +/- 0.2 nm
   for Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Ag and Au NPs, respectively. Of them, Pt NPs were
   detailed characterized. The obtained Pt NPs were found to have fcc
   crystal structure with 1.2 nm crystalline size which is very similar to
   the corresponding TEM result. The efficiency of the synthesis of NPs by
   micromixer was compared with batch/NaBH4 reduction method for the Pt
   NPs. It was found that in batch method the as-prepared NPs decreased the
   reducing ability of NaBH4 by catalytic degradation. In contrast, the
   micromixer could separate the produced metal NPs from the reaction
   system soon after the formation of NPs and enables feeding the fresh
   NaBH4 solution throughout the synthesis. Fourier Transform Infrared
   (FTIR) spectrometry measurements of adsorbed 12CO molecules on Pt NPs
   showed that the NPs surface were negatively charged with a high
   population of edge and vertices atoms.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Microgecko Nikolsky 1907 belongs to the family Gekkonidae and
   contains eight species distributed in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan,
   northwestern India and, probably, in Iraq. Among them, the Latifi's
   dwarf gecko, Microgecko latifi, is endemic to central and southwestern
   Iran. We used MaxEnt modeling approach to investigate the effects of
   climate change and potential distribution of M. latifi. A total of 29
   presence records and five factors related to precipitation and
   temperature were collected and used in the modeling approach for past,
   present and future. Our findings showed that Central Persia, the largest
   terrestrial ecoregion of Iran, hosts the most suitable environment for
   M. latifi under the current climate as well as under future scenarios.
   Differently, Zagros Mountains hosted the most suitable environment for
   this species under past climate. This is in line with previous studies
   that identified Zagros, Alborz, Kopet-Dagh Mountains and northwestern
   Iran as important Pleistocene refugia. Among environmental variables,
   precipitation of the warmest quarter was the most important driving
   factor for all models. According to other studies, species richness and
   diversity of lizards in Iran are higher in hot and arid environments;
   also considering the possible effects of global warming, further
   investigations are required in those environments.}},

Title = {{Full-waveform distortion characteristics of photon counting Lidar at
   different dead-time}},
Journal = {{OPTIK}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{223}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Photon Counting Lidar is widely used in the detection of far and
   small targets because of high sensitivity. When the laser spot covers
   the target, only obtaining a position and reflectivity information from
   each pixel can no longer meet the needs of target detection and
   recognition. The intensity distribution of pulse laser echo is modulated
   by the target. Due to the existence of dead time, the first photon bias
   occurs, which causes waveform distortion between photon waveform and
   pulse laser echo. So studying the waveform distortion characteristics
   with various parameters is of great significance to acquire the target
   information in a single pixel. In this paper, a universal iterative
   detection probability calculation method is improved to quickly
   reconstruct the photon waveform, and three parameters of correlation
   distance, ratio of pulse peak, and relative time difference are defined
   to describe the details of the waveform distortion. The waveform
   distortion is analyzed at typical dead-time with various parameters,
   such as single-pulse photon number, pulse width, noise, and target
   position. The results show that when the dead-time is shorter than the
   time interval of targets or single-pulse photon number is less than 0.1,
   the correlation distance is less 5\% and the waveform distortion could
   be negligible, while the others couldn't. When the count of noise is
   less than 107/s, or the pulse width is 5\% of the interval of targets,
   or the duration of the target position is slightly longer than the time
   interval of targets, the waveform distortion is minimal.}},

Title = {{Effects of triaxial strain on carrier activity, carrier lifetime, and
   absorption spectrum of (S, Se, Te) and 2 N Co-doped ZnO}},
Journal = {{VACUUM}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{182}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The acceptor (N)-isovalent (S, Se, Te) elements that separately co-dope
   ZnO is a novel doping technology. However, the effects of triaxial
   strain on the photocatalytic performance and mechanism of doped systems
   are often neglected in experimental studies. Moreover, the influence of
   interstitial H on the doped ZnO system is not considered. This paper
   adopted first-principles and selected the appropriate strain range and
   step length. Assuming the equivalent effect of several strain points of
   tensile strain or compressive strain, we used simulation calculation to
   fit the complex strain problem in the actual process (such as doping,
   the strain problem caused by the difference of the lattice constant and
   thermal expansion coefficient of the substrate and the doping system),
   and then studied physical properties of the doped system. The planar
   wave ultrasoft pseudopotential + U method based on the first-principles
   generalized gradient approximation under the framework of density
   functional theory was used to calculate (S, Se, Te) and 2 N co-doped
   ZnO. The interstitial H-doped Zn36SO33N2 was studied as a representative
   ZnO system. Results showed that the binding energy of all doping systems
   under unstrained conditions was negative with a relatively high
   stability. The strain increased under tensile strain and compressive
   strain. As the formation energy of the doping systems increased, system
   stability decreased. Although the band gap of all compressive strain
   systems widened, impurities formed in the band gap, and valence band
   electrons absorbed photons of low energy to transition to the energy
   level of the impurities and then to the energy level of conduction band.
   The photoexcited electron-graded transitions induced the absorption
   spectrum to red-shift. The band gap of the system widened, whereas the
   band gaps of other tensile strain systems narrowed, except for when the
   tensile strain was 1\%. However, regardless of whether the band gap of
   the tensile strain system became narrow or wide, the photoexcited
   electrons were still able to transition in stages. Hence, the absorption
   spectrum of the tensile strain system still red-shifted. The stability,
   activity, carrier separation, and lifetime of Zn36SHiO33N2 were
   relatively better than those of Zn36SO33N2 at 5\% tensile strain. These
   properties make Zn36SHiO33N2 an ideal photocatalyst. This study provides
   a theoretical reference for the experimental design and preparation of
   novel ZnO photocatalysts.}},

Title = {{Patterns of neurological deficits and recovery of postoperative C5 nerve
   palsy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-SPINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{742-750}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE Paresis of the C5 nerve is a well-recognized complication of
   cervical spine surgery. Numerous studies have investigated its incidence
   and possible causes, but the specific pattern and character of
   neurological deficits, time course, and relationship to preoperative
   cord signal changes remain incompletely understood.
   METHODS Records of patients undergoing cervical decompressive surgery
   for spondylosis, disc herniation, or ossification of the longitudinal
   ligament, including the C4-5 level, were reviewed from a 15-year period,
   identifying C5 palsy cases. Data collected included age, sex, diabetes
   and smoking statuses, body mass index, surgical levels, approach,
   presence of increased cord signal intensity, and modified Japanese
   Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scores. Narrative descriptions of the
   patterns and findings on neurological examination were reviewed, and
   complications were noted. The minimum follow-up requirement for the
   study was 12 months.
   RESULTS Of 642 patients who underwent cervical decompressive surgery, 18
   developed C5 palsy (2.8\%). The incidence was significantly lower
   following anterior surgery (6 of 441 {[}1.4\%]) compared with that
   following cervical laminectomy and fusion (12 of 201 {[}6.0\%]) (p <
   0.001). There were 10 men and 8 women whose mean age was 66.7 years
   (range 54-76 years). The mean preoperative mJOA score of 11.4 improved
   to 15.6 at the latest follow-up examination. There were no differences
   between those with and without C5 palsy with regard to sex, age, number
   of levels treated, or preor postoperative mJOA score. Fifteen patients
   with palsy (83\%) had signal changes/myelomalacia on preoperative
   T2-weighted imaging, compared with 436 of 624 (70\%) patients without
   palsy; however, looking specifically at the C4-5 level, signal
   change/myelomalacia was present in 12 of 18 (67\%) patients with C5
   palsy, significantly higher than in the 149 of 624 (24\%) patients
   without palsy (p < 0.00003). Paresis was unilateral in 16 (89\%) and
   bilateral in 2 (11\%) patients. All had deltoid weakness, but 15 (83\%)
   exhibited new biceps weakness, 8 (44\%) had triceps weakness, and 2
   (11\%) had hand intrinsic muscle weakness. The mean time until onset of
   palsy was 4.6 days (range 2-14 days). Two patients (11\%) complained of
   shoulder pain preceding weakness; 3 patients (17\%) had sensory loss.
   Recovery to grade 4/5 deltoid strength occurred in 89\% of the patients.
   No patient had intraoperative loss of somatosensory or motor evoked
   potentials or abnormal intraoperative C5 electromyography activity.
   CONCLUSIONS Postoperative C5 nerve root dysfunction appears in a delayed
   fashion, is predominantly a motor deficit, and weakness is frequently
   appreciated in the biceps and triceps muscles in addition to the deltoid
   muscle. Preoperative cord signal change/myelomalacia at C4-5 was a
   significant risk factor. No patient had a detectable deficit in the
   immediate postoperative period or changes in intraoperative
   neuromonitoring status. Neurological recovery to at least that of grade
   4/5 occurred in nearly 90\% of the patients.}},

Title = {{Assessing Organizational Focus on Health Literacy in North Texas
   Hospitals}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NURSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{24-33}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Overview: In 2012, the Institute of Medicine Roundtable on Health
   Literacy established 10 attributes of a health literate health care
   organization that, if instated, would improve health information and
   empower patients to make more informed health decisions. Few studies
   have assessed how well organizations meet these attributes.
   Purpose: This study sought to describe the extent to which health care
   systems in North Texas were adopting policies and practices that address
   the 10 attributes of a health literate health care organization. More
   specifically, we sought to describe key organizational leaders' and
   clinicians' perceptions in this regard.
   Study design and methods: This was a mixed-methods study, conducted with
   a convenience sample of 74 key informants from 13 hospitals across five
   health care systems. Informants provided demographic data, and their
   perceptions of the extent to which their hospital met the 10 attributes
   were measured via the Health Literate Health Care Organization 10-item
   questionnaire (HLHO-10) and semistructured interviews.
   Results: Mean scores for HLHO-10 items ranged from 3.74 to 5.39, with 7
   as a maximum score. Qualitative data provided richer content,
   elaborating on the survey results. Workforce training in health
   literacy, patient inclusion in health information development and
   evaluation, and communication about health care costs were rated the
   lowest and were described as issues of concern.
   Conclusion: Study findings indicated limited leadership and little
   systemic promotion of efforts to ensure health literate health care
   organizations, although individual health literacy champions sometimes
   stepped up with creative initiatives.}},

Title = {{Effects of equilibrium time and adsorption models on the
   characterization of coal pore structures based on statistical analysis
   of adsorption equilibrium and disequilibrium data}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{281}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Low-pressure CO2 adsorption is an important tool for quantitatively
   characterizing the micropore characteristics of porous materials. While
   only adsorption data obtained at adsorption equilibrium will ensure the
   accuracy of the method. In this paper, 82 sets of CO2 adsorption
   equilibrium and disequilibrium data of coal samples with different
   particle sizes were investigated, and the influence of equilibrium
   criterion and data analysis methods on the adsorption data and
   calculation of pore characteristics was studied by statistical analysis
   method. Furthermore, to explore methods to distinguish between
   low-pressure CO2 adsorption equilibrium and disequilibrium data, the
   correlation between different analysis methods and the adsorption
   equilibrium and disequilibrium data were then analyzed. The results
   suggest: for the coal samples with complex micropore structures, the
   linearly increasing CO2 adsorption isotherm is most likely caused by the
   disequilibrium adsorption; the analysis on adsorption disequilibrium
   data often leads to underestimation of the pore structures in small pore
   size range, and moreover the Dubinin-Astakhow method (D-A) is
   particularly sensitive to adsorption disequilibrium data, which would
   lead to great errors for the calculation of pore characteristics; the
   more developed the micropore structures, the higher the demarcation
   point between the correlation coefficient of the Dubinin-Radushkevich
   method (D-R) and adsorption equilibrium and disequilibrium data, where
   the fitting errors obtained by using the Monte-Carlo method (M-C) to fit
   the adsorption equilibrium data were mostly less than 0.2. This study
   could provide some guidance for more accurate use of gas physisorption
   methodology, especially for porous solid materials with complex
   micropore structures like coal.}},

Journal = {{DYES AND PIGMENTS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{End-capped effects are important in modifying the structures of donor
   materials, with the purpose of regulating material properties and
   achieving high open-circuit voltage (V-OC). A series of
   acceptor-pi-donor-pi-acceptor (A-pi-D-pi-A) type small-molecule donor
   (SMD) materials for bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells with
   PC71BM as electron acceptor have been designed and synthesized. Three
   novel small molecules are denoted as flu (3TRD)(2), flu(3TCN)(2) and
   flu(3TIN)(2), with dioctyl-substituted fluorene as core, 3,3
   `'-dioctyl-2,2':5,2 `'-terthiophene as pi-bridge, terminated by
   rhodanine, malononitrile and 1,3-indanedione, respectively. Improvements
   of photovoltaic performance have been successfully realized via tuning
   terminal electron-withdrawing units. The power conversion efficiency
   (PCE) of the devices as-cast prepared from flu(3TRD)(2), flu(3TCN)(2)
   and flu(3TIN)(2) increases in turn, which is ascribed to incremental
   optical absorption thereby promoting short-circuit current density
   (J(SC)). Particularly, flu(3TCN)(2) shows deeper LUMO and HOMO energy
   levels than flu(3TRD)(2) and flu (3TIN)(2) due to the strong
   electron-withdrawing character of malononitrile. As expected, the device
   as-cast based on flu(3TCN)(2) exhibits a reasonable high V-OC of 1.07 V.
   In addition, a satisfactory PCE of 7.06\% has been obtained for
   flu(3TCN)(2) based device with dichlommethane vapor treatment.}},

Title = {{Estimating Micro-Level On-Road Vehicle Emissions Using the K-Means
   Clustering Method with GPS Big Data}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Due to the advanced spatial data collection technologies, the locations
   of vehicles on roads are now being collected nationwide, so there is a
   demand for applying a micro-level emission calculation methods to
   estimate regional and national emissions. However, it is difficult to
   apply this method due to the low data collection rate and the
   complicated calculation procedure. To solve these problems, this study
   proposes a vehicle trajectory extraction method for estimating
   micro-level vehicle emissions using massive GPS data. We extracted
   vehicle trajectories from the GPS data to estimate the emission factors
   for each link at a specific time period. Vehicle trajectory data was
   divided into several groups through a k-means clustering method, in
   which the ratios of each operating mode were used as variables for
   clustering similar vehicle trajectories. The results showed that the
   proposed method has an acceptable accuracy in estimating emissions.
   Furthermore, it was also confirmed that the estimated emission factors
   appropriately reflected the driving characteristics of links. If the
   proposed method were utilized to update the link-based micro-level
   emission factors using continuously accumulated trajectory data for the
   road network, it would be possible to efficiently calculate the
   regional- or national-level emissions only using traffic volume.}},

Abstract = {{Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the
   causative virus of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To
   establish a safe and convenient assay system for studying entry
   inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, we
   constructed a codon-optimized, full-length C-terminal mutant spike (S)
   gene of SARS-CoV-2. We generated a luciferase (Luc)-expressing
   pseudovirus containing the wild-type or mutant S protein of SARS-CoV-2
   in the envelope-defective HIV-1 backbone. The key parameters for this
   pseudovirus-based assay, including the S mutants and virus incubation
   time, were optimized. This pseudovirus contains a Luc reporter gene that
   enabled us to easily quantify virus entry into angiotensin-converting
   enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing 293T cells. Cathepsin (Cat)B/L inhibitor E
   -64d could significantly block SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in
   293T-ACE2 cells. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus
   could be neutralized by sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients or
   recombinant ACE2 with the fused Fc region of human IgG1. Thus, we
   developed a pseudovirus-based assay for SARS-CoV-2, which will be
   valuable for evaluating viral entry inhibitors and neutralizing

Abstract = {{The support materials are an important part of catalysts and they are
   the dispersant, adhesive, and support for other components. In this
   study, three types of thin films with different structures were used as
   the precursor to prepare loading Pd catalysts. The one-step dealloying
   method was used to prepare a semiconductor nanofiber film (NFF) support
   material with upward directional growth from the substrate. Pd/NFF and
   Pd/NiO/NFF loaded Pd catalysts were prepared using NFF as the support
   material, and the electrochemical catalytic properties for ethanol
   oxidation in alkaline media were studied. Cyclic votammetry showed that
   the NFF support material effectively inhibited agglomeration of
   palladium, increased the number of active sites of Pd, and improved the
   electrocatalytic properties of Pd for ethanol oxidation. In addition,
   the Pd/NiO/NFF loaded Pd catalyst obtained by modification with nickel
   oxide significantly improved the electrocatalytic performance for
   ethanol oxidation compared with the Pd/NFF loaded Pd catalyst. These
   results show that NiO is conductive to absorption of oxygen-containing
   groups on the surface of the catalyst and can further improve the
   electrocatalytic ability of Pd for ethanol oxidation. All of the above
   results demonstrate that the support material prepared by the dealloying
   method has application prospects in load-type catalysts. (C) 2020

Title = {{A Comprehensive Transcriptional Profiling of Pepper Responses to
   Root-Knot Nematode}},
Journal = {{GENES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Genetic resistance remains a key component in integrated pest management
   systems. The cosmopolitan root-knot nematode (RKN; Meloidogyne spp.)
   proves a significant management challenge as virulence and pathogenicity
   vary among and within species. RKN greatly reduces commercial bell
   pepper yield, and breeding programs continuously develop cultivars to
   emerging nematode threats. However, there is a lack of knowledge
   concerning the nature and forms of nematode resistance. Defining how
   resistant and susceptible pepper cultivars mount defenses against RKN
   attacks can help inform breeding programs. Here, we characterized the
   transcriptional responses of the highly related resistant (Charleston
   Belle) and susceptible (Keystone Resistance Giant) pepper cultivars
   throughout early nematode infection stages. Comprehensive transcriptomic
   sequencing of resistant and susceptible cultivar roots with or without
   Meloidogyne incognita infection over three-time points; covering early
   penetration (1-day), through feeding site maintenance (7-days
   post-inoculation), produced > 300 million high quality reads. Close
   examination of chromosome P9, on which nematode resistance hotspots are
   located, showed more differentially expressed genes were upregulated in
   resistant cultivar at day 1 when compared to the susceptible cultivar.
   Our comprehensive approach to transcriptomic profiling of pepper
   resistance revealed novel insights into how RKN causes disease and the
   plant responses mounted to counter nematode attack. This work broadens
   the definition of resistance from a single loci concept to a more
   complex array of interrelated pathways. Focus on these pathways in
   breeding programs may provide more sustainable and enduring forms of
   resistance.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{253}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This study presents a new state-based PeriDynamic (PD) model of a
   composite laminate with arbitrary laminate layup; it captures all types
   of material couplings in the presence of transverse shear deformation.
   It consists of normal and shear bonds instead of fiber and matrix bonds
   to allow arbitrary fiber orientations. Also, rotational degrees of
   freedom are included in the equilibrium equations in order to evaluate
   the transverse shear angle and curvature. Mindlin-Reissner plate theory,
   employed in this model, permits the use of existing composite
   constitutive law which leads to the coupling between different
   deformation modes. In addition, a quasi-local boundary condition applied
   only to the first row of material points avoids the approximation of
   nonlocal boundary values. The accuracy of this model is verified against
   benchmark solutions, and validated by comparison with experimental
   results.}},

Title = {{A high-sensitivity and long-distance structural health monitoring system
   based on bidirectional SH wave phased array}},
Journal = {{ULTRASONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{108}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{When estimating a structural health monitoring (SHM) system, its defect
   sensitivity and area/distance coverage are most important factors. For
   commonly used guided wave sparse array system, it usually requires a
   reference state as the baseline which is not available in many cases. In
   comparison, phased array technique typically does not need the baseline
   in simple structures and it had been successfully used in nondestructive
   testing (NDT). However, currently developed phased array systems
   employed omni-directional transducers routinely, where the wave energy
   is distributed equally along all directions thus it is not favorable for
   long-distance detection. In this work, bidirectional piezoelectric
   transducers were used to form a linear phased array system, which can
   generate/receive shear horizontal (SH) wave with high energy
   concentration. Firstly, the configuration of the employed transducer
   composed by antiparallel d(15) piezoelectric strips (APS) was presented.
   Then the total focusing method (TFM) employed for defect detection was
   introduced. After validating the radiation pattern of SH wave generated
   by the APS, the properties of beam steering for the proposed phased
   array was investigated. Finally, experiments were carried out to
   validate its performance in detection of various defects. Results
   indicated that even for a 1 mm through-thickness hole 700 mm away, the
   proposed phased array system can still detect it accurately, which is
   much better than previous SHM systems. Dual defects including a crack
   and a hole can also be clearly detected without baseline. The
   high-sensitivity of the proposed system was attributed to the employed
   bidirectional transducer which can generate non-dispersive SH0 wave with
   high energy concentration. This proposed SH wave phased array system
   will provide a high-performance SHM method for plate-like structures.}},

Title = {{An aptamer-based magnetic flow cytometer using matched filtering}},
Journal = {{BIOSENSORS \& BIOELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{169}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Facing unprecedented population-ageing, the management of
   noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) urgently needs a point-of-care (PoC)
   testing infrastructure. Magnetic flow cytometers are one such solution
   for rapid cancer cellular detection in a PoC setting. In this work, we
   report a giant magnetoresistive spin-valve (GMR SV) biosensor array with
   a multi-stripe sensor geometry and matched filtering to improve
   detection accuracy without compromising throughput. The carefully
   designed sensor geometry generates a characteristic signature when cells
   labeled with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) pass by thus enabling
   multi-parametric measurement like optical flow cytometers (FCMs).
   Enumeration and multi-parametric information were successfully measured
   across two decades of throughput (37 - 2730 cells/min). 10-mu m polymer
   microspheres were used as a biomimetic model where MNPs and
   MNP-decorated polymer conjugates were flown over the GMR SV sensor array
   and detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as 2.5 dB due to
   the processing gain afforded by the matched filtering. The performance
   was compared against optical observation, exhibiting a 92\% detection
   efficiency. The system achieved a 95\% counting accuracy for biomimetic
   models and 98\% for aptamer-based pancreatic cancer cell detection. This
   system demonstrates the ability to perform reliable flow cytometry
   toward PoC diagnostics to benefit NCD control plans.}},

Abstract = {{Seed vigor is crucial for crop early establishment in the field and is
   particularly important for forage crop production. Oat (Avena sativa L.)
   is a nutritious food crop and also a valuable forage crop. However,
   little is known about the genetics of seed vigor in oats. To investigate
   seed vigor-related traits and their genetic architecture in oats, we
   developed an easy-to-implement image-based phenotyping pipeline and
   applied it to 650 elite oat lines from the Collaborative Oat Research
   Enterprise (CORE). Root number, root surface area, and shoot length were
   measured in two replicates. Variables such as growth rate were derived.
   Using a genome-wide association (GWA) approach, we identified 34 and 16
   unique loci associated with root traits and shoot traits, respectively,
   which corresponded to 41 and 16 unique SNPs at a false discovery rate <
   0.1. Nine root-associated loci were organized into four sets of
   homeologous regions, while nine shoot-associated loci were organized
   into three sets of homeologous regions. The context sequences of five
   trait-associated markers matched to the sequences of rice, Brachypodium
   and maize (E-value < 10(-10)), including three markers matched to known
   gene models with potential involvement in seed vigor. These were a
   glucuronosyltransferase, a mitochondrial carrier protein domain
   containing protein, and an iron-sulfur cluster protein. This study
   presents the first GWA study on oat seed vigor and data of this study
   can provide guidelines and foundation for further investigations.}},

Journal = {{SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{139}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{When buried pipes are subjected to seismic waves, the leading cause of
   the failure of pipes is not inertial forces due to the deformation of
   foundation. If the pipe-soil dynamic contact could not be effectively
   simulated, it is difficult to properly achieve the large deformations of
   pipes under seismic action. This article examines the capabilities of
   three pipe-soil contact models to identify the best model. Firstly, the
   peak strains and displacements of theoretical calculations are compared
   with the results obtained from experimental tests, which confirmed the
   accuracy of test data. Goodman contact model, friction contact model,
   and spring-damping contact model are adopted and their simulation
   results are compared with the test results. Subsequently, it is proved
   that Goodman contact model is in good agreement with reality. By
   conducting comprehensive parametric studies, the interactional rules of
   soil pressure, frictional stress, strain, and relative displacement with
   depth and pipe diameter are investigated at interface of pipe and soil
   according to Goodman contact model. The direct curve representation of
   data for pipe-soil interactions is then obtained, which provides the
   basis for the data collection of pipe-soil interactions.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of E-commerce, online advertising began to thrive
   and has gradually developed into a new mode of business, of which
   Click-Through Rates (CTR) prediction is the essential driving
   technology. Given a user, commodities and scenarios, the CTR model can
   predict the user's click probability of an online advertisement.
   Recently, great progress has been made with the introduction of Deep
   Neural Networks (DNN) into CTR. In order to further advance the
   DNN-based CTR prediction models, this paper introduces a new model of
   FO-FTRL-DCN, based on the prestigious model of Deep\&Cross Network (DCN)
   augmented with the latest optimization technique of Follow The
   Regularized Leader (FTRL) for DNN. The extensive comparative experiments
   on the iPinYou datasets show that the proposed model has outperformed
   other state-of-the-art baselines, with better generalization across
   different datasets in the benchmark.}},

   three-quarter Heusler compounds}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Heusler-based compounds are a class of important inorganic materials
   with potential applications in spintronics, solar cells,
   thermoelectrics, optoelectronics, and so on. Previous studies mainly
   focus on half-Heusler compounds or full-Heusler compounds. In this work,
   a class of MCo1.5Sn (M = Ti, Zr, and Hf) compounds, which are named as
   three-quarter Heusler compounds, has been synthesized. Their formation
   mechanism, crystal structure, and physical properties have been
   systematically investigated. Both the high-angle annular dark field
   images and X-ray refinement confirm that their crystal structures can be
   viewed as the ordered half-Heusler sublattice with the four empty
   tetrahedral holes being disorderedly occupied by two extra Co atoms.
   Electronic structure calculations and experimental results reveal that
   these compounds are metallic ferromagnets. The magnetic ordering below
   the Curie temperature greatly affects the electrical transports due to
   the scattering by spin fluctuations. The three-quarter Heusler compounds
   have ultralow lattice thermal conductivities compared with other typical
   Heusler-based compounds due to the partial occupation of Co at the 4d
   sites. This work enriches the investigation on the Heusler-based
   compounds. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical decision support systems provide empirical guidance to improve
   the quality of nursing care. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes
   of implementation of decision support functions into the preventive care
   system as regards nurses' acceptance of technology, documentation
   completeness, and incidence of hospital-acquired pressure injury. The
   researchers performed data collection in a regional hospital in northern
   Taiwan. The study used the Davis Science and Technology Acceptance Model
   scale to investigate nurses' technology acceptance before and after the
   introduction of a clinical decision support system and compared
   documentation compliance of preventive records with the incidence of
   hospital-acquired pressure injuries. Results showed that nurses'
   acceptance of the technology was significantly improved, and the
   completion rate of the pressure injury preventive care record
   significantly increased from 88.9\% to 99.9\%. Meanwhile, the incidence
   of hospital-acquired pressure injury decreased significantly from
   0.057\% to 0.021\%. Therefore, it was concluded that the clinical
   decision support system provides evidenced-based support to nurses and
   is effective in identifying patient-specific prevention nursing plans of
   care.}},

Title = {{Assessing Groundwater Level with a Unified Seasonal Outlook and
   Hydrological Modeling Projection}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although the annual rainfall in Taiwan is high, water shortages still
   occasionally occur owing to its nonuniform temporal and spatial
   distribution. At these times, the groundwater is considered an
   acceptable alternative water source. Groundwater is of particular value
   because it is considered a clean and reliable source of fresh water. To
   prevent water scarcity, this study utilized seasonal forecasting by
   incorporating hydrological models to evaluate the seasonal groundwater
   level. The seasonal prospective issued by the Central Weather Bureau of
   Taiwan (CWB) was combined with weather generator data to construct
   seasonal weather forecasts as the input for hydrological models. A
   rainfall-runoff model, HEC-HMS, and a coupled groundwater and surface
   water model, WASH123D, were applied to simulate the seasonal groundwater
   levels. The Fengshan Creek basin in northern Taiwan was selected as a
   study site to test the proposed approach. The simulations demonstrated
   stability and feasibility, and the results agreed with the observed
   groundwater table. The calibrations indicated that the average errors of
   river stage were 0.850 for R-2, 0.279 for root-mean-square error (RMSE),
   and 0.824 for efficiency coefficient (CE). The simulation also revealed
   that the simulated groundwater table corresponded with observed
   hydrographs very well (R-2 of 0.607, RMSE of 0.282 m, and CE of 0.621).
   The parameters were verified in this study, and they were deemed
   practical and adequate for subsequent seasonal assessment. The seasonal
   forecast of 2018 at Guanxi station indicated that the 25th and 75th
   percentiles of simulated annual rainfall were within 1921-3285 mm and
   the actual annual rainfall was 2031 mm. Its seasonal rainfall outlook
   was around 30\% accurate for forecasts of three consecutive months in
   2018. Similarly, at Xinpu station, its seasonal rainfall outlook was
   about 40\% accurate, and the amount of annual rainfall (1295 mm) was
   within the range of the 25th and 75th percentiles (1193-1852 mm). This
   revealed that the actual annual precipitations at both Guanxi and Xinpu
   station corresponded with the range of 25th and 75th percentiles of
   simulated rainfall, even if the accurate rate for the 3 month seasonal
   forecast had some error. The subsequent groundwater simulations were
   overestimated because the amount of actual rainfall was far lower than
   the average of the historical record in some dry season months. However,
   the amount of rainfall returned to normal values during the wet seasons,
   where the seasonal forecast and observation results were similar.}},

Title = {{Structural Coupling Between the Qiman Tagh and the Qaidam Basin,
   Northern Tibetan Plateau: A Perspective From the Yingxiong Range by
   Integrating Field Mapping, Seismic Imaging, and Analogue Modeling}},
Journal = {{TECTONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Qiman Tagh and the Qaidam Basin within the northern Tibetan Plateau
   are contrasting in geomorphological, geological, and geophysical
   features. The Yingxiong Range is the largest anticlinal belt in the SW
   Qaidam Basin and holds a key in understanding the relationship between
   the above two tectonic units. Herein, we investigated the geometry,
   shortening, timing and mechanism of the structural deformation across
   the Yingxiong Range by integrating field mapping, interpretation of
   3-D/2-D seismic reflection data and analogue modeling. The structural
   interpretation demonstrates that the Yingxiong Range is primarily
   controlled by NE-directed basement-involved reverse faults. These faults
   likely sole into a decollement layer at depth of similar to 15 km
   through the excess area-depth analysis. This pattern is complicated by
   the development of a local salt layer that decouples the deformation of
   underlying and overlying strata, as indicated by analogue modeling.
   Deformation initially occurred at similar to 8.1 Ma but strengthened at
   similar to 2.5 Ma, with total shortening up to similar to 5 km in the NW
   part but decreasing to <2 km to the SE. Together with published results,
   our findings revealed an NE-directed thrust system involving the Qiman
   Tagh and the SW Qaidam Basin, with the Yingxiong Range as the front of
   this system. We further inferred that this NE-directed thrust system in
   the upper crust, together with the previously identified SW-directed
   deep reverse fault offsetting the Moho, may form a southwestward
   tapering tectonic wedge, which likely results from the heterogeneity of
   lithospheric mantle between the Qaidam Basin and the Qiman Tagh-East
   Kunlun Shan.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the recurrence rate of papillary thyroid
   microcarcinoma (PTMC) was assessed by analyzing postoperative follow-up
   data of affected patients and its associations with BRAF V600E, clinical
   pathology and imaging factors were explored. A total of 506 patients
   with PTMC were selected who underwent surgery from January 2014 to March
   2016. The maximal diameter of thyroid nodules was <= 1 cm and all
   patients who underwent BRAF V600E testing and evaluation for lymph node
   metastasis. Postoperatively, each patient was regularly followed up to
   detect recurrence. Categorical variables were comparatively analyzed
   using univariate Cox linear regression analysis to screen for protective
   and adverse factors influencing recurrence of PTMC. A stepwise Cox
   proportional hazards regression model analysis was performed to explore
   risk factors affecting recurrence. Among the 506 patients, 477 were
   followed up, 29 were lost to follow-up and 26 patients experienced
   recurrence. The 5-year recurrent rate of PTMC was 5.45\%. The univariate
   Cox regression analysis indicated that PTMC recurrence was influenced by
   BRAF V600E, sex, multifocality, capsular invasion and lateral cervical
   lymph node metastasis (P<0.05), but not by age, tumor location on the
   thyroid, size, single central lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis
   and operative approach (P>0.05). The significant factors associated with
   recurrent PTMC were subjected to stepwise multivariate Cox proportional
   hazards regression model analysis and the results indicated that BRAF
   V600E, sex, multifocality and lateral cervical lymph node metastasis
   were independent factors influencing recurrence in patients with PTMC,
   with a statistically significant difference (P<0.05). In conclusion,
   BRAF V600E, sex, multifocality and lateral cervical lymph node
   metastasis are independent risk factors for recurrent PTMC.}},

   oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and apoptosis of Bufo gargarizans
   embryos}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{In natural ecosystems, living organisms are always subjected to a
   mixture of multiple heavy metals exposure, yet it is more common to
   study the effect of individual, rather than combined exposure. This
   study assessed the impacts of single or combined exposure to Cr and Cu
   on embryonic development, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and
   apoptosis in the early development of Bufo gargarizans embryos. The
   total length, development stage and malformations of embryos were
   measured, and the mRNA expression of genes related to oxidative stress,
   lipid metabolism and apoptosis at Gs 18 and Gs 22 were determined by
   RT-qPCR. The results showed that all treatments significantly reduced
   the total length of embryos, delayed the stage of embryonic development
   and increased the proportion of malformed embryos. The Cr-Cu mixture
   treatment showed the greatest suppression of embryonic development and
   induced the highest rate of embryo malformation, compared to individual
   Cr and Cu treatments. In addition, the expression levels of oxidative
   stress genes (HSP90, SOD and GPx) and fatty acid beta-oxidation-related
   genes (ACOXL, ECHS1 and SCP) showed an up-regulated trend in treatments
   compared to control groups. Conversely, the lipid synthesis-related mRNA
   gene expressions (KAR, TECR, ACSL3 and ACSL4) were down-regulated. Among
   them, the Cr-Cu mixture had the greatest impact on lipid metabolism gene
   expression. The treatments showed significant effects on the expression
   of apoptosis genes (Bcl-1 and Bax), with Bcl-1 mRNA expression
   increasing and Bax mRNA expression decreasing. These results indicated
   that exposure to individual Cr, Cu and a Cr-Cu mixture can lead to
   oxidative stress, disrupt lipid metabolism and promote apoptosis, and
   the Cr-Cu mixture could cause more serious negative effects on B.
   gargarizans embryos than Cr or Cu individually.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{167}},

Abstract = {{Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have been studied over the past several
   decades as a promising candidate for stationary energy storage
   applications. It is therefore important to understand the reliability of
   RFBs and the mechanisms that cause degradation with time. Contributions
   from individual electrodes are difficult to separate especially for
   long-term cycle testing due to the lack of a stable reference electrode.
   In our work, the reliability and degradation mechanisms of an
   all-vanadium RFB were investigated by a stable reference electrode based
   on the dynamic hydrogen electrode (DHE). The newly developed DHE
   reference electrode demonstrated high accuracy and long-term stability
   that enables in situ monitoring of individual electrode signals over
   hundreds of cycles in a vanadium RFB. This approach enables the full
   cell degradation to be separated into contributions from the cathode and
   anode. The cathode and anode were found to play quite different roles in
   the increase in overpotential of the vanadium RFB during long-term
   cycling. The anode reaction limited both the charge and discharge
   capacity over 100 cycles. The negative side also appeared to be the rate
   limiting factor throughout cycling as determined by EIS measurement. The
   cathode contributed to the performance degradation as cycling exceeded
   50 cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Soft materials possess magnificent properties which could be harnessed
   for different potential applications. Compared to other soft materials,
   hydrogels have some unique advantages which can be used in the shape
   deformation or shape transformation of structures. This paper aims to
   investigate the deformation mechanisms of hydrogel-based bi-material
   beam structures and study the non-uniform geometric effects on the shape
   transformation including programmable scroll and helical deformations.
   With a sloped thickness design, the structures could be transformed from
   an initial quasi-2D beam configuration into some other 2D self-scroll
   and 3D self-helical configurations. From the hydrogel material model, a
   modified deformation formula for bi-material beam structures based on
   the framework of the classical beam theory has been developed to predict
   the shape morphing behaviors. The relationship between the curvature and
   the mismatch strain is derived in its explicit form and the theoretical
   results are verified through several numerical simulations. Furthermore,
   experiments are carried out to demonstrate the design principles for
   reconfigurable bi-material beam structures and the experiments show that
   the structures tend to deform similarly to that predicted by the
   analytical models. The presented work could provide guidance for future
   applications of responsive hydrogel-based bi-material beam structures
   such as in soft actuators and soft robots.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new asymmetric pixel confusion algorithm for images based
   on the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) public-key cryptosystem and Arnold
   map. First, the RSA asymmetric algorithm is used to generate two groups
   of Arnold transform parameters to address the problem of symmetrical
   distribution of Arnold map parameters. Second, the image is divided into
   blocks, and the first group of parameters is used to perform Arnold
   confusion on each sub-block. Then, the second group of parameters is
   used to perform Arnold confusion on the entire image. The image
   correlation is thereby fully weakened, and the image confusion degree
   and effect are further enhanced. The experimental results show that the
   proposed image pixel confusion algorithm has better confusion effect
   than the classical Arnold map based confusion and the row-column
   exchange based confusion. Specifically, the values of gray difference
   are close to one. In addition, the security of the new confusion
   operation is dependent on RSA, and it can act as one part of a
   confusion-substitution structure in a cipher.}},

Abstract = {{Selective hydrogenation of lignocellulosic biomass-derived chemicals is
   of great importance for future energy and chemical supply. So far formic
   acid is considered as one of the most promising materials for hydrogen
   storage. Herein, we report a novel pathway for the hydrogenation of
   Levogluosenone (LGO), a biorenewable platform chemical, to
   dihydrolevoglucosenone (Cyrene) and levoglucosanol (Lgol) using formic
   acid as a hydrogen source. Testing with typical hydrogenation catalysts
   indicated the crucial influence of the type on reaction selectivity and
   identified Pd/C as the most suitable catalyst. Among solvents screened,
   THF in combination with Pd/C showed the best performance for LGO
   hydrogenation, producing Cyrene in >99\% yield at a low temperature (60
   degrees C). Nevertheless, hydrogenation of Cyrene to Lgol required a
   harsher condition as a result of the difficult reduction property of its
   C=O bond. Elevating the reaction temperature to 180 degrees C and
   increasing double Pd dosage enabled a high yield of Lgol, attaining to
   94.8\%. (C) 2020 Energy Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Differing roles of base and fast flow in ensemble seasonal streamflow
   forecasting: An experimental investigation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{591}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Seasonal streamflow forecasting, which is important for water resources
   management, is generally a challenging task in hydrology. This paper
   focuses on the consideration of base and fast flow for the forecasting
   of seasonal streamflow. Taking the three tributaries of the Pearl River
   in South China as case study, five forecasting experiments, which
   forecast the average daily flow in the three-month period by using the
   average daily flow in the antecedent month, are devised to elucidate the
   different roles of base, fast, and total flow. The recursive digital
   filter (RDF) model is employed for the separation of base flow from fast
   flow; the Bayesian joint probability (BJP) model is applied to generate
   ensemble forecasts under cross validation; and the Schaake shuffle is
   used to establish temporal structure to link ensemble members when
   adding up forecasts of base flow and fast flow. Forecasts in the
   different experiments are evaluated in terms of bias, reliability, and
   skill, and the relationship between correlation coefficient and forecast
   skill is illustrated. The results show that unbiased and reliable
   seasonal forecasts are generally obtained in the experiments.
   Correlation coefficients of base flow are overall higher than those of
   total flow while correlation coefficients of fast flow are lower.
   Forecast skill tends to increase with correlation coefficient.
   Meanwhile, fast flow can lead to extremely large total flow in the
   antecedent month, which can substantially enlarge the forecasts and
   diminish the forecast skill when the corresponding observation is not as
   large. By contrast, base flow tends to always contribute to forecast
   skill. The separation of base flow from fast flow, which accounts for
   the different dynamical processes of fast and base flow, can reduce the
   impact of fast flow and improve the forecast skill of total flow.}},

Abstract = {{Worries about unethical behavior are a recurring issue in the finance
   industry, which has inspired a number of recent studies. We contribute
   to this ongoing discussion by investigating preferences for truthfulness
   within the finance industry in a controlled experiment with 415
   financial professionals (and 270 students as a control group).
   Participants have to report one of two numbers, of which one is true,
   the other false, where truth-telling is costly. In three main treatments
   we vary the situational context of subjects' decisions (abstract,
   neutral, finance context) by applying differently framed instructions.
   We find that contexts matter for financial professionals: they act more
   honestly in a financial context and a neutral context than in an
   abstract situation, while for a control group we find no such
   differences. Further variations on the financial decision situation do
   not affect financial professionals' honesty. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Title = {{Why do teachers believe educational neuromyths?}},
Journal = {{TRENDS IN NEUROSCIENCE AND EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: It is not well understood whether qualified teachers believe
   neuromyths, and whether this affects their practice and learner
   outcomes.
   Method: A standardised survey was administered to practising teachers (N
   = 228) to determine whether or not they believe fictional (neuromyth) or
   factual statements about the brain, the confidence in those beliefs, and
   their application.
   Results: Although factual knowledge was high, seven neuromyths were
   believed by >50\% of the sample. Participants who endorsed neuromyths
   were generally more confident in their answers than those who identified
   the myths. Key neuromyths appear to be incorporated into classrooms.
   Conclusion: Australian teachers, like their overseas counterparts, have
   some neuroscience awareness but are susceptible to neuromyths. A
   stronger partnership with neuroscientists would addresss the complex
   problem of disentangling brain facts from fictions, and provide better
   support for teachers. This study uncovered psychometric weaknesses in
   the commonly used neuromyth measure that future research should address.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of increasing levels of olive leaves in the diet on intake,
   growth rate and meat quality of kids was studied. Twenty-four Mahabadi
   kids (initial body weight (BW) of 21.3 +/- 1.14 kg and 5-6 months of
   age) were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 8). One group was fed a
   basal diet as control (without OL) while the diet of the other two
   groups was modified by substituting 7.5 \% (OL7.5) and 15 \% (OL15) of
   the control with OL. The results showed that total dry matter intake and
   growth performance were not affected by diets (P 0.05). Feeding OL
   increased the concentrations of C18:1 (P < 0.001), C18:2 n-6 (P < 0.05),
   C18:3 n-3 (P < 0.001), n-6 PUFA (P < 0.001) and n-3 PUFA (P < 0.05) and
   decreased the C16:0 (P < 0.05), C18:0 (P < 0.01) and the ratio of
   n-6/n-3 (P < 0.05) in both muscle and adipose tissues. An important
   increase (P < 0.01) was observed in CLA of meat, with increasing OL

Abstract = {{The aim of this research was an investigation into creating a rigid gel

   potential way of treating verdigris-damaged paper. Various gel recipes
   were mixed and tested on historical samples. The gel recipes varied in
   gellan gel concentration, BTA/solvent solution concentration, and BTA
   concentration. The recipe effectiveness was assessed using Hulthe's
   indicator paper and MQuant (TM) Test Cu indicator strips, two types of
   indicator papers which detect free copper ions. The results showed that
   rigid gel application of BTA is effective in complexing the copper ions
   which may inhibit further damage to the paper caused by free copper
   ions. Some of the other effects of the gel were the simultaneous removal
   of paper discolouration by the gel. Further research is needed to refine
   the gel recipes as well as the treatment process to prevent or reduce
   potential tidelines and other possible negative side-effects of gel

   and Fibrosis in Kidney in Mice}},
Journal = {{CANCERS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   Paraneoplastic nephrotic syndrome is a complication arising in lung
   cancer patients. In the present study, we established an LLC1 cell
   orthotopic xenograft C57BL/6 mice model to translation paraneoplastic
   nephrotic syndrome (PNS). The pathological aspects of PNS were
   characterized in TGF-beta signaling-engaged renal fibrosis, and renal
   inflammation with IL-6 expression in kidney. To reveal how the lung
   cancer cells remotely drive pathogenic progression, secretome derived
   from LLC1 cells and A549 cells were proteomically profiled.
   Additionally, the secretome profiling was subjected to diseases and
   biofunctions assessment by Ingenuity Pathway analysis (IPA). As matter
   of secretome profiling and IPA prediction, the Fibronectin, C1r, and C1s
   are potential of nephrotoxicity linked to paraneoplastic effects on
   glomerular pathogenesis in these lung cancer mice.
   Kidney failure is a possible but rare complication in lung cancer
   patients that may be caused by massive tumor lysis or a paraneoplastic
   effect. Clinical case reports have documented pathological
   characteristics of paraneoplastic syndrome in glomeruli, but are short
   of molecular details. When Lewis lung carcinoma 1 (LLC1) cells were
   implanted in mice lungs to establish lung cancer, renal failure was
   frequently observed two weeks post orthotopic xenograft. The high
   urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) was diagnosed as
   paraneoplastic nephrotic syndrome in those lung cancer mice. Profiling
   the secretome of the lung cancer cells revealed that the secretory
   proteins were potentially nephrotoxic. The nephrotoxicity of lung
   cancer-derived secretory proteins was tested by examining the pathogenic
   effects of 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6), and 5 x 10(6) LLC1 cell xenografts on
   the pathogenic progression in kidneys. Severe albuminuria was present in
   the mice that received 5 x 10(6) LLC1 cells implantation, whereas 10(6)
   cell and 2 x 10(6) cell-implanted mice have slightly increased
   albuminuria. Pathological examinations revealed that the glomeruli had
   capillary loop collapse, tumor antigen deposition in glomeruli, and
   renal intratubular casts. Since IL-6 and MCP-1 are pathologic markers of
   glomerulopathy, their distributions were examined in the kidneys of the
   lung cancer mice. Moderate to severe inflammation in the kidneys was
   correlated with increases in the number of cells implanted in the mice,
   which was reflected by renal IL-6 and MCP-1 levels, and urine ACR.
   TGF-beta signaling-engaged renal fibrosis was validated in the lung
   cancer mice. These results indicated that lung cancer cells could
   provoke inflammation and activate renal fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{The tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) is a promising solution for
   high energy-efficient circuits. Based on the band-to-band tunneling
   (BTBT) condition, fast switching characteristic with a steep
   subthreshold swing (SS) in the ultralow-voltage operation is feasible.
   Our prior work has demonstrated that the SS and ON-state current can be
   improved without leakage current penalty through the usage of SiGe
   low-bandgap material in the epitaxial tunnel layer (ETL). ETL-TFET is
   highly compatible with the CMOS process, enabling heterogeneous
   integration of TFET and MOSFET in the same technology. In this work, the
   circuit performance of ETL-TFET and fully depleted SOI (FDSOI) MOSFET is
   evaluated and compared in terms of energy and delay metrics. By
   combining the advantages of TFET and MOSFET, heterogeneous pMOS-NTFET
   dynamic logic gates are proposed. The pMOS-NTFET-based logic gates
   demonstrate the lowest energy consumption than other realizations.
   Asynchronous datapath is leveraged to combat the timing variations in
   the ultralow-voltage region. A 20.9\%-33.9\% energy reduction is
   achieved compared with the conventional MOSFET counterpart.}},

Title = {{Rock damage control for large-diameter-hole lateral blasting excavation
   based on charge structure optimization}},
Journal = {{TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{106}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Controlling rock damage induced by lateral blasting excavation is a
   source of concern. In underground mines, large-diameter-hole lateral
   blasting excavation often causes engineering disasters such as large
   blocks falling and overall collapse of the remaining rock mass. Because
   of their high cost and cumbersome operation, conventional contour
   blasting techniques, such as smooth and presplit blasting, are
   unsuitable for production boreholes. In this paper, based on the
   large-diameter-hole lateral blasting excavation of the Shaxi underground
   mine in China, a field lateral blast test with a single row was
   initially conducted, and the sonic wave speeds and goaf boundaries were
   measured to evaluate the damage degree to the remaining rock mass. A
   numerical model with three rows of boreholes was developed and
   calibrated against the lateral blast test with a single row. The
   calibrated numerical model was used to simulate the blasting process.
   The blast-induced damage characteristics with different charge
   structures in different rows were investigated, and the optimal charge
   structure for each row was obtained. The results indicate that the rock
   damage control effect can be achieved by a reasonable combination of
   charge structures and number of blasted rows, and it is more
   satisfactory with an increasing number of blasted rows and a reasonable
   decrease in the charge coefficient row by row. The rock breaking pattern
   at Cut X2 shows that most of the boulders are caused by the collapse of
   the remaining rock mass under the impact of blasting excavation. The
   ratio of broken rock in Part 4 indicates that the blast impact of the
   last row plays a dominant role in the damage to the remaining rock mass.
   Two optimized schemes were applied to the field of
   large-diameter-borehole lateral blasting, and satisfactory effects were
   achieved in the blast-induced damage control of the remaining rock mass.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of white matter hyperintensities
   (WMHs) on the progression from mild parkinsonian signs (MPS) to
   parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease (PD). Participants with MPS
   completed 5 years of follow-up. WMHs were divided into periventricular
   WMHs and deep WMHs according to magnetic resonance imaging scans. The
   diagnosis of MPS, parkinsonism, and PD was based on the motor portion of
   the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Cox proportional hazard
   models were used to identify the association between WMHs and MPS
   progression. Of the 636 participants, 166 (26.1\%) with MPS developed
   parkinsonism and PD after follow-up. After adjusting for potential
   factors, severe WMHs were associated with an increased risk of MPS
   progression, moderate and severe periventricular WMHs and severe deep
   WMHs were associated with the risk of MPS progression, and severe WMHs
   were associated with the progression of gait/balance impairment,
   bradykinesia, and rigidity. Additionally, participants treated for
   vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and
   hypercholesterolemia had a lower risk of MPS progression. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, many countries in the world have been
   struggling with high indebtedness. This has been especially emphasized
   in periods of crisis, and this was not an exception during the last
   global economic crisis in 2009. The advent of the crisis has further
   increased the need for borrowing. Increasing indebtedness after the
   crisis was also characteristic of BiH economy, the country in our
   research focus, which had an increase of public external debt by over
   100\% over the last two decades.
   The paper focuses on the external indebtedness of Bosnia and Herzegovina
   (BiH) over the period 2004-2017. The empirical part relies on dynamic
   modelling - Vector Autoregression Model, which is used to explore total
   external indebtedness. The empirical investigation implies that
   foreign-trade exchange deficits have had the greatest impact on rising
   indebtedness in BiH, while movements in EURIBOR interest rates have
   little influence in explaining this variability. The empirical
   investigation implies that macroeconomic policy in BiH, if it wants to
   keep the external debt under control over the longer time horizon, does
   need to focus on deficits in its foreign exchange more. One of
   inevitable priorities is to work on supporting production based of
   export from this economy.}},

Abstract = {{Young children show remarkably sophisticated abilities to evaluate
   others. Yet their abilities to engage in proportional moral evaluation
   undergoes protracted development. Namely, young children evaluate
   someone who shares absolutely more as being ``nicer{''} than someone who
   shares proportionally more (e.g., sharing 3-out-of-6 is nicer than
   sharing 2-out-of-3, because 3 > 2, even though 3/6 < 2/3), whereas
   adults think the opposite. We investigate the hypothesis that this prior
   work underestimates children's proportional social reasoning by relying
   on discrete and spatially separated quantities (e.g., individual
   stickers), which can hinder proportional reasoning even outside social
   contexts. In three experiments we examine whether 4- and 5-year-old
   children's social evaluations are impacted by the discreteness and
   spatial separation of the resource and compare their behavior to adults
   (18 to 63 years; across all samples: 38\% girls/women, 62\% boys/men; no
   other demographic data was collected). We find that children are
   sensitive to these features: when the resource was divided into discrete
   units (Experiment 1) or spatially separated (Experiment 2) children were
   more likely to use absolute amount, as opposed to proportion, relative
   to when the resources were not divided and remained spatially connected.
   However, adults were highly sensitive to proportion regardless of the
   display's perceptual features (Experiment 3), and children's use of
   proportion remained below adult-levels. These results suggest that
   perceptual features influence children's use of absolute versus
   proportional information in their social evaluations, which has
   theoretical and methodological implications for understanding children's
   conceptions of fairness.}},

Abstract = {{We present the case of a patient who fell from a 3-m height. He was
   bought to the emergency department and immediate resuscitative measures
   were taken. His GCS on presentation was 15, and the airway was patent
   and maintainable. Breathing was equal bilaterally, the blood pressure
   and capillary refill were established to be normal, and a bedside E-FAST
   scan was negative. He was found to have a dislocated left knee, with
   sensorineural loss distal to the injury. After the dislocation was
   reduced, a whole-body CT scan was performed and revealed an incidental
   finding of thrombus in the inferior vena cava (IVC). A thrombus in the
   IVC by itself is an uncommon complication among trauma patients, but
   among the cases noted in literature, most patients with an IVC thrombus
   had a slightly delayed presentation and it was usually discovered a few
   days after admission. Management of the thrombus depends on the
   stability of the patient's presentation. When feasible, operative or
   otherwise invasive procedures can be delayed, allowing for the medical
   management of the thrombus. IVC filters may also be used, but their use
   may be limited due to anatomical restrictions, as in our case.}},

Abstract = {{In recent studies, structural health monitoring has been extensively
   investigated using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. An FBG bending
   sensor that simultaneously measured strain and direction through
   geometric combinations of three FBG sensors was analyzed in a previous
   study. However, we relied on manual labor as no conventional method for
   manufacturing this type of sensor exists. Consequently, the fabricated
   sensor was inconsistent and generated increased errors; hence, a method
   to compensate for this inconsistency is required. In this study, a new
   support unit was designed and manufactured to solve this problem, and a
   method for fabricating an FBG bending sensor using this unit was
   developed. Two sets of cantilever bending experimental tests, i.e.,
   those for bending sensors manufactured using the new method and those
   manufactured by hand, were performed to analyze the performance of the
   proposed method. The experimental results showed that the proposed
   method exhibited superior reproducibility and sensor fabrication
   performance.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As part of the tests, a two-phase NiAl/Ni3Al alloy and a composite based
   on this alloy with 4 vol\% addition of TiB2 were produced by the
   reactive FAST/SPS (Field Assisted Sintering Technology/Spark Plasma
   Sintering) sintering method. The sintering process was carried out at
   1273 K for 30 s under an argon atmosphere. The effect of reactive SPS on
   the density, microstructure, and mechanical and tribological properties
   of a dual-phase Ni-Al intermetallic compound and Ni-Al-TiB2 composite
   was investigated. Products obtained were characterized by a high degree
   of sintering (over 99\% of the theoretical density). The microstructure
   of sinters was characterized by a large diversity, mainly in regard to
   the structure of the dual-phase alloy (matrix). Compression tests showed
   satisfactory plastic properties of the manufactured materials,
   especially at high temperature (1073 K). For both materials at room
   temperature, the compressive strength was over 3 GPa. The stress-strain
   curves were observed to assume a different course for the matrix
   material and composite material, including differences in the maximum
   plastic flow stress depending on the test temperature. The
   brittle-to-ductile transition temperature was determined to be above 873
   K. The research has revealed differences in the physical, mechanical and
   tribological properties of the produced sinters. However, the
   differences favourable for the composite were mostly the result of the
   addition of TiB2 ceramic particles uniformly distributed on grain
   boundaries.}},

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{Nojirimycin (NJ) is a compound in which the oxygen of the ring is
   replaced with an NH group in the D-glucose structure. NJ, which has a
   structure similar to D-glucose, is a powerful glucosidase inhibitor and
   an interesting compound. However, no anti-inflammatory effects of NJ
   have been reported. Therefore, to investigate its anti-inflammatory
   effect, the production and expression of inflammatory cytokines, as well
   as inflammatory mediators, such as iNOS and COX-2, were measured in
   LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. In addition, the effects on the
   representative inflammatory signaling pathways, the suppression of
   NE-kappa B, and the activation of MAPK were studied. The production of
   iNOS, COX-2, and inflammatory cytokines (PGE(2), IL-6, IL-1 beta, and
   TNF-alpha) after NJ treatment was significantly inhibited. In addition,
   NJ showed anti-inflammatory effects through suppression of LPS-induced
   NF-kappa B activation. D-Glucose is structurally similar to NJ. The
   effects of these substances on RAW264.7 macrophages were evaluated. NJ
   reduced nitric oxide (NO) levels, whereas D-glucose had no significant
   effect. Overall, the results suggested that NJ is a potential
   anti-inflammatory compound.}},

Abstract = {{Microspine grippers address a large variety of possible applications,
   especially in field robotics and manipulation in extreme environments.
   Predicting and modeling the gripper behavior remains a major challenge
   to this day. One of the most complex aspects of these predictions is how
   to model the spine to rock interaction of the spine tip with the local
   asperity. This paper proposes a single spine model, in order to fill the
   gap of knowledge in this specific field. A new model for the anchoring
   resistance of a single spine is proposed and discussed. The model is
   then applied to a simulation campaign. With the aid of simulations and
   analytic functions, we correlated performance characteristics of a spine
   with a set of quantitative, macroscopic variables related to the spine,
   the substrate and its usage. Eventually, this paper presents some
   experimental comparison tests and discusses traversal phenomena observed
   during the tests.}},

Title = {{Coulomb drag propulsion experiments of ESTCube-2 and FORESAIL-1}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{177}},
Pages = {{771-783}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents two technology experiments - the plasma brake for
   deorbiting and the electric solar wind sail for interplanetary
   propulsion - on board the ESTCube-2 and FORESAIL-1 satellites. Since
   both technologies employ the Coulomb interaction between a charged
   tether and a plasma flow, they are commonly referred to as Coulomb drag
   propulsion. The plasma brake operates in the ionosphere, where a
   negatively charged tether deorbits a satellite. The electric sail
   operates in the solar wind, where a positively charged tether propels a
   spacecraft, while an electron emitter removes trapped electrons. Both
   satellites will be launched in low Earth orbit carrying nearly identical
   Coulomb drag propulsion experiments, with the main difference being that
   ESTCube-2 has an electron emitter and it can operate in the positive
   mode. While solar-wind sailing is not possible in low Earth orbit,
   ESTCube-2 will space-qualify the components necessary for future
   electric sail experiments in its authentic environment. The plasma brake
   can be used on a range of satellite mass classes and orbits. On
   nanosatellites, the plasma brake is an enabler of deorbiting - a
   300-m-long tether fits within half a cubesat unit, and, when charged
   with - 1 kV, can deorbit a 4.5-kg satellite from between a 700- and
   500-km altitude in approximately 9-13 months. This paper provides the
   design and detailed analysis of low-Earth-orbit experiments, as well as
   the overall mission design of ESTCube-2 and FORESAIL-1.}},

Abstract = {{Propionic Acidemia (PA) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by
   variants in the PCCA or PCCB genes, leading to mitochondrial
   accumulation of propionyl-CoA and its by-products. Here, we report a 2
   year-old Egyptian boy with PA who was born to consanguineous parents.
   Biochemical analysis was performed using tandem mass spectrometry
   (MS/MS) on the patients dried blood spots (DBS) followed by urine
   examination of amino acids using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
   (GC/MS). Molecular genetic analysis was carried out using whole-exome
   sequencing (WES). The PCCA gene sequencing revealed a novel homozygous
   missense variant affecting the locus (chr13:100962160) of exon 16 of the
   PCCA gene, resulting in the substitution of the amino acid arginine with
   proline at site 476 (p.Arg476Pro). Computational analyses revealed that
   the novel variant might have a pathogenic effect that attributed to
   decreased protein stability, and also has an effect on the biotin
   carboxylase c-terminal domain of the propionyl carboxylase enzyme. The
   physicochemical properties analysis using NCBI amino acid explorer study
   revealed restrictions in the side chain and loss of hydrogen bonds due
   to the variant. On the structural level, the loss of beta-sheet was
   observed due to the variant proline, which has further led to the loss
   of surrounding interactions. This loss of beta-sheet and the surrounding
   interactions might serve the purpose of the structural stability
   changes. The current study demonstrates that the combination of
   whole-exome sequencing (WES) and computational analysis are potent tools
   for validation of diagnosis and classification of disease-causing
   variants.}},

Title = {{Sex differences in glucoprivic regulation of glycogen metabolism in
   hypothalamic primary astrocyte cultures: Role of estrogen receptor
   signaling}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{518}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Hypoglycemia causes sex-reliant changes in hypothalamic astrocyte
   glycogen metabolism in vivo. The role of nuclear versus membrane
   astrocyte estrogen receptors (ER) in glucoprivic regulation of glycogen
   is unclear. Here, primary hypothalamic astrocyte cultures were treated
   with selective ER antagonists during glucoprivation to investigate the
   hypothesis that ER mediate sex-specific glycogen responses to
   glucoprivation. Results show that glucoprivic down-regulation of
   glycogen synthase expression is mediated by transmembrane G
   protein-coupled ER-1 (GPER) signaling in each sex and estrogen receptor
   (ER)-beta (ER beta) activity in females. Glucoprivic inhibition of
   glycogen phosphorylase involves GPER and ERp in females, but
   ER-independent mechanisms in males. GPER, ER beta, and ER-alpha (ER
   alpha) inhibit or stimulate AMPK protein expression in male versus
   female astrocytes, respectively. Glucoprivic augmentation of
   phospho-AMPK profiles in male glia was opposed by GPER activation,
   whereas GPER and ER beta suppress this protein in females. Astrocyte ER
   alpha and GPER content was downregulated in each sex during glucose
   deficiency, whereas ER beta levels was unaltered (males) or increased
   (females). Glucoprivation correspondingly elevated or diminished male
   versus female astrocyte glycogen content; ER antagonism reversed this
   response in males, but not females. Results identify distinctive ER
   variants involved in sex-similar versus sex-specific astrocyte protein
   responses to withdrawal of this substrate fuel. Notably, glucoprivation
   elicits a directional switch or gain-of-effect of GPER and ER beta on
   specific glial protein profiles. Outcomes infer that ERs are crucial for
   glucoprivic regulation of astrocyte glycogen accumulation in males.
   Alternatively, estradiol may act independently of ER signaling to
   disassemble this reserve in females.}},

   recalcitrant palmoplanter warts Randomized comparative controlled study}},
Journal = {{PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recalcitrant palmoplanter warts represent a therapeutic
   challenge. Side effects of local destructive methods necessitates the
   need for other less morbid modalities. Recently immunotherapy as well as
   light based devices and lasers have emerged as therapeutic approaches.
   Aim of the study: To compare between the safety and efficacy of
   intralesional vitamin D3 injection and photo dynamic therapy (PDT) using
   eosin in treatment of recalcitrant palmoplanter warts.
   Patients and Methods: Prospective, randomized, controlled comparative
   study. Fifty -six patients with recalcitrant palmoplanter warts were
   randomly divided into 3 groups. Group A was injected with intralesional
   vitamin D3. Group B was subjected to PDT using eosin loaded in
   trasferosomes as a photosensitizer. Group C is the control group.
   Clinical improvement was assessed by photographic records and
   dermoscopic assessment, at baseline, before each session and after
   completion of treatment. Patients were followed up for 6 months after
   cure to detect recurrence.
   Results: Group A and B showed complete clearance in 88.89 \% and 86.36
   \% respectively compared to 18.75 \% in the control group. These results
   were statistically significant (P value<0.001). No side effects were
   reported except for pain during injection in group A.
   Conclusion: In the current study, both vitamin D3 and PDT using Eosin
   are safe, highly effective and well tolerated modalities in treatment of
   viral warts.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the internal thyroid dose received by residents involved in
   the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident has been
   a challenging task because of the shortage of direct human measurements
   related to the largest contributing radioisotope to the dose, I-131. In
   a previous dose estimation, we used the results of whole-body counter
   (WBC) measurements targeting Cs-134 and Cs-137, based on the assumption
   that these radioisotopes were incorporated at the same time as I-131 in
   the early phase of the accident. The main purpose of this study was to
   clarify whether the trace of the early intake remained in the WBC
   measurements that were started several months after the accident. In the
   present work, WBC data of 1,639 persons from Namie town, one of the
   heavily contaminated municipalities, were analyzed together with their
   evacuation behavior data. The results demonstrated that the cesium
   detection rate in the WBC results was several times higher in the late
   evacuees {[}who evacuated outside the 20-km radius of the FDNPP at 3:00
   p.m. (Japanese Local Time) on 12 March or later] compared to the prompt
   evacuees (who evacuated before 3:00 p.m. on 12 March). Among the adults,
   the cesium detection rates (and the 90th percentile values of the Cs-137
   intake) of the prompt and late evacuees were about 20\% (5.4 x 10(3) Bq)
   and 60\% (1.6 x 10(4) Bq), respectively. Approximately 20\% of the
   individuals analyzed were categorized as late evacuees. These
   differences in cesium would be caused by exposure to the radioactive
   plume in the afternoon on 12 March, which was likely to influence the
   late evacuees. On the other hand, the intake on 15 March, when the
   largest release event occurred, was expected to be relatively small for
   Namie town's residents. In conclusion, the trace of the early intake
   remained in the WBC measurements, although this would not necessarily be
   true for all subjects. The results obtained from this study would
   provide useful information for the reconstruction of the early internal
   thyroid doses from radioiodine in the future.}},

Abstract = {{This study was a retrospective survey that evaluated the trend of
   clinical use and misuse of antibiotics on animals presented for
   veterinary care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Nsukka, Enugu
   State, Nigeria, from January 2013 to December 2017. A total of 4851 case
   files were evaluated and, overall, antibiotics were used in 2316 cases
   (47.74\%). The most frequently used antibiotics were a
   penicillin-streptomycin combination (36.53\%), oxytetracycline
   (32.08\%), gentamicin (19.78\%) and sulphadimidine (5.35\%); the
   frequency of use of other antibiotics was each less than 5\%. The
   overall use of antibiotics increased significantly (p<0.05) across the
   study period, from 35.25\% in 2013 to 52.38\% in 2016. There was a
   significant (p<0.05) increase in the frequency of use of oxytetracycline
   (11.55\% in 2013 to 40.31\% in 2016) and sulphadimidine (0.8\% in 2013
   to 12.98\% in 2017), but the frequency of penicillin-streptomycin use
   significantly (p<0.01) decreased from 74.5\% in 2013 to 23.13\% in 2017.
   The frequency of inappropriate use of antibiotics significantly (p<0.01)
   increased from 4.38\% (2013) to 25.29\% (2017), while that of
   non-compliance rose significantly (p<0.01) from 15.54\% (2013) to
   41.88\% (2016). The frequency of use of antibiotics without definitive
   diagnosis/sensitivity testing was consistently high and did not
   significantly (p>0.05) vary across the study period (85.49\% to
   91.63\%), but, that of the use of wrong antibiotic combinations
   significantly increased (p<0.05) from 5.58\% (2013) to 23.63\% (2017).
   It is concluded that the overall frequency of clinical use of
   antibiotics on animals, their inappropriate use, non-compliance and
   wrong combinations significantly increased across the study period.}},

Abstract = {{The growth process of pores in aluminum during directional
   solidification was simulated by the multi-phase field method. First, the
   effect of solid-liquid interface moving speed (V) and temperature
   gradient (G) on pore size was investigated. We found that the simulation
   results coincided well with the actual experimental results. Second, V
   was changed during the formation of the lotus metal under constant G and
   the appropriate condition was determined for the pore to extend
   steadily. We confirmed that by controlling V to be negatively
   proportional to the pore growth rate, the pore could be extended while
   its width was kept constant.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The aim is to demonstrate the validity of the monitoring
   through intraoral scanner of the dental movements and the real impact,
   advantages, and convenience, in terms of treatment time and efficiency
   gain, to frequently monitor a patient with the scanner application.
   Methods: A movement control of palatally impacted canines was performed,
   surgically treated with laser opercolectomy. Three-dimensional models of
   the patient's dental arch were obtained with intraoral scanner during a
   monitoring time of 4 months. The STL (Standard Triangle Language) files
   were superimposed with the 3D models extrapolated from the pre-operative
   CT (Computerized Tomography). The measurements of eruption, exposed
   palatal and vestibular areas, and distances between the canines and the
   incisors were performed, using digital technologies and with a digital
   caliber. Results: Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of
   the data obtained from both conventional and digital monitoring has been
   realized and performing the T Student Test for paired data. Conclusion:
   The advantages of digital monitoring are numerous, like the possibility
   to reduce the error of method caused by manual measurement on plaster
   casts and the possibility to compare the pattern and amount of eruption
   of the canine in the same patient overtime.}},

Abstract = {{The Baltic Sea is essential for marine ecosystem services (MES)
   provision and the region's socio-economic dynamics. It is considered one
   of the busiest and most polluted regional seas in Europe. In recent
   years a collective effort in enforcing European and regional
   environmental policies and directives (e.g. Water Framework Directive
   2000/60/EC, 2000; Marine Strategy Framework Directive 2008/56/EC, 2008;
   Maritime Spatial Planning Directive 2014/89/EU, 2014) has been carried
   out. Ecosystem Services assessment and mapping is integrated into these
   directives. An increasing number of scientific studies, projects, and
   other works were developed in this context, generating a vast body of
   knowledge. Despite all efforts to improve the Baltic Sea's environmental
   status, the targets established were not fulfilled. It is also important
   to analyze if current methodological approaches for assessing and
   mapping MES are robust enough to provide the needed results. This
   perspective paper analyses the status of assessment and mapping
   methodologies. The results showed that most of the studies were focused
   on qualitative assessments, with limited validation and reliability.
   Although the number of robust and quantitative works is increasing, more
   are needed. It is vital to carry out quantitative assessments to inform
   decision-makers better and standardize MES practices across the Baltic
   Sea.}},

Abstract = {{Systems of high-dimensional nonlinear ordinary differential equations
   play a significant role in Physics and applied sciences including
   big-data optimization, financial models, epidemic disease models. In
   this paper, we are concerned with numerical solutions of Bao's system
   that is a 4-dimensional hyperchaotic system introduced by Bo-Cheng and
   Zhong (2008). We solve the Bao's system with both the Crank-Nicolson and
   power series methods. Crank-Nicolson method is eventually evolved into a
   new system whose solution is presented in a quite neat algorithmic
   manner. By adding standard Brownian motion to each term in the model, we
   express the Bao's system as a system of stochastic differential
   equations. We solve the stochastic system with an Euler-type approximate
   solution method. By adding noise and expressing time derivatives with
   Caputo-type fractional derivative, we study on synchronization and
   parameter estimation of the models. To the best of our knowledge, Bao's
   system has not been numerically solved with the methods employed in this
   paper previously, and this paper considers fractional and stochastic
   Bao's system for the first time in the history of research. Techniques
   employed by us in this paper may serve as a framework for solutions of
   many other systems of ordinary differential equations including Lorenz
   types and epidemic models. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   predominant role as a lingua franca. The aim of the article is to
   analyze the communicative competence in English of the undergraduate
   students who apply for the outgoing mobility programs of the National
   University of the South, and observe if said level acts as a bridge or
   barrier that facilitates or limits internationalization processes. The
   results obtained indicate that students enter the higher level of

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In actuality, it is difficult to obtain an early prognostic
   stratification for patients with acute respiratory failure treated with
   noninvasive ventilation (NIV). We tested whether an early evaluation
   through a predictive scoring system could identify subjects at risk of
   in-hospital mortality or NIV failure. METHODS: This was a retrospective
   study, which included all the subjects with acute respiratory failure
   who required NIV admitted to an emergency department-high-dependence
   observation unit between January 2014 and December 2017. The HACOR
   (heart rate, acidosis {[}by using pH], consciousness {[}by using the
   Glasgow coma scale], oxygenation {[}by using p(aO2)/F-IO2], respiratory
   rate) score was calculated before the NIV initiation (T0) and after 1 h
   (T1) and 24 h (T24) of treatment. The primary outcomes were inhospital
   mortality and NIV failure, defined as the need for invasive ventilation.
   RESULTS: The study population included 644 subjects, 463 with
   hypercapnic respiratory failure and an overall in-hospital mortality of
   23\%. Thirty-six percent of all the subjects had NIV as the
   ``ceiling{''} treatment. At all the evaluations, nonsurvivors had a
   higher mean +/- SD IIACOR score than did the survivors (T0, 8.2 4.9 vs
   6.1 +/- 4.0; T1, 6.6 :Ix 4.8 vs 3.8 3.4; T24, 5.3 +/- 4.5 vs 2.0 2.3
   {[}all P < .001]). These data were confirmed after the exclusion of the
   subjects who underwent NIV as the ceiling treatment (T0, 8.2 +/- 4.9 vs
   6.1 +/- 4.0 {[}P = .002]; T1, 6.6 +/- 4.8 vs 3.8 +/- 3.4; T24, 5.3 +/-
   4.5 vs 2.0 +/- 3.2 {[}all P < .001]). At T24, an HACOR score > 5
   (Relative Risk {[}RR] 239, 95\% CI 1.60-3.56) was associated with an
   increased mortality rate, independent of age and the Sequential Organ
   Failure Assessment score. CONCLUSIONS: Among the subjects treated with
   NIV for acute respiratory failure, the HACOR score seemed to be a useful
   tool to identify those at risk of in-hospital mortality.}},

Title = {{Identification of artisanal fishing territories and associated conflicts
   in the middle and lower Parana River (Argentina) through participatory
   mapping}},
Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale fisheries exhibit diverse territorial conflicts with other
   users and productive activities coexistent in fluvial environments,
   which usually are difficult to handle by management agencies. The aim of
   this study is to identify and spatialize the conflicts which most affect
   small-scale artisanal fisheries on the Middle and Lower Paran ` a River,
   as well as to expand the fishing territory concept for large rivers
   through the development of a participatory mapping (PM) process along
   with artisanal fishers. PM was performed in different fishing
   communities of the Middle and Lower Paran ` a River. The information
   gathered was processed by the Quantum GIS software and local fishing
   maps were drawn up. Livestock represented the main conflictive factor in
   terms of limiting fishing activity. Shore use and occupancy were
   identified as one of the main sources of conflict for fishers, due to
   the reduction of mooring and landing areas that have been lost or
   allocated for other purposes. The `sustainable fishing territory' was
   proposed as a new concept, based on integration of the fishing territory
   idea and the areas of ecological value, proposing such framework as an
   umbrella area for conservation purposes. Differences in attributes used
   for developing the fishing territories suggested that PM was effective
   in recognizing local characteristics on a small scale. Although PM
   remains still poorly explored for large floodplain rivers, it provides
   an opportunity to understand the complexity of fishing territories
   within a context of fisheries management and territorial planning. In
   this context, PM represents also an effective tool for dealing with
   conflicts between stakeholders who share the fluvial space through
   different productive and recreational activities.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church has continued to
   raise concerns about the psychological health of the Catholic clergy.
   The current investigation analyzed Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
   Inventory (MMPI)-2 and MMPI-2-RF profiles of 53 seminary and 82
   diaconate applicants from 2015 to 2019 in a mid-Atlantic city of the
   United States. This study posed a recurring, but important question: are
   applicants to the Catholic clergy psychologically healthy? Results
   indicate that the applicants had aggregate scores below the T of 65
   cut-off but scored comparatively higher on the
   underreporting/defensiveness validity indices and overcontrolled
   hostility than the national norm group. Between-groups analyses found
   that seminarian applicants scored higher than diaconate applicants on
   Schizophrenia and Psychoticism scales. Applicants scored significantly
   lower on all scales mapped onto risk factors when compared to a norm
   group of child sexual offenders except underreporting. The findings are
   consistent with previous research using the MMPI-2 with similar
   populations; that is, clergy applicants are generally well-adjusted and
   psychologically healthy but with a tendency for underreporting.
   Clinically, psychological evaluations with clergy applicants need to be
   attuned to outlier scores on clinical scales and use multimethods to
   complete a thorough assessment of psychopathology. Future research would
   benefit from longitudinal analyses of MMPI-2-RF profiles and
   psychosocial correlates to sexual offending risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{The article is aimed at studying the main evaluation strategies and
   tactics through contextual analysis of immigration problems in the
   British social media discourse. The article considers evaluation as a
   cognitive-pragmatic phenomenon and identifies it as a powerful means of
   persuasion for manipulating public opinion. The commutative strategies
   and tactics are defined as the main tools to achieve the author's
   pragmatic intention and the goal. Thus, it has become relevant to
   identify what evaluation strategies and tactics the author uses to
   highlight immigration issues in British society. As a result, the
   diversity of examples allows us to conclude that a key evaluation
   strategy of British media discourse that presents the immigration issues
   is a strategy of disapproval, expressed through the tactics of a
   recognition of the existence of the problem, accusation, reproach,
   discredit, misunderstanding, doubt, indication of the future,
   disagreement and distancing that imply negative evaluation.}},

Title = {{Enhanced separation and analysis of low abundant soy proteins by dual

Journal = {{ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{610}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Soybean seeds provide a rich source of proteins, fats, carbohydrates,
   and micronutrients. Extraction and analysis of low abundant soybean seed
   proteins are challenging because of its complex seed composition. For
   characterizing various proteins, it is paramount to remove the other
   interfering components, primarily oils, and carbohydrates. In the
   present study, we used a sequential dual washing process initially with
   hexane to remove oil and non-polar interferences, followed by 80\%
   ethanol washing to remove about 60\% of the total soluble sugars. The
   extracted soluble sugars were quantified using a newly developed and
   validated high-performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light
   scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD). This newly developed combined washings
   process significantly enhanced the separation of both low molecular
   weight and low abundant proteins using 1D (one dimensional)- and 2D (two
   dimensional) gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were
   trypsinized and analyzed by using Bruker amazon speed ion trap mass
   spectrometer equipped with an ESI source. This combined washing process
   allowed the identification of 18 additional low abundant soy proteins as
   compared to the simple hexane washed samples. This purification process
   will allow researchers to identify and investigate the role of low
   molecular weight and low abundant proteins as it relates to plant
   functions, nutrition, and health.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Globally, wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity, exposing
   populations to toxic trace elements stored within forests. Trace element
   and Pb isotope compositions in aerosols (n = 87) from four major
   wildfires near Sydney, Australia (1994-2004) were evaluated (Mood's
   median test) to determine any significant differences in concentration
   before, during or after wildfires. The US EPA's positive matrix
   factorization (PMF) model was used to distinguish a wildfire-related
   particulate source factor. Atmospheric concentrations of Cd and Mn were
   approximately 2.5 times higher during fire periods. PMF modelling
   distinguished a soil factor (Ca, Si, Ti and Zn) and an
   anthropogenically-sourced factor (Cd, Pb). The Cd, Pb anthropogenic
   factor was present at twice the concentration during wildfire periods
   (compared to before or after). Lead isotopic analyses of aerosols
   revealed that former leaded gasoline depositions were subject to
   remobilization during post-200 0 wildfire periods. Trace element
   increases during wildfires are unlikely to exceed health-based criteria.

Abstract = {{Populism marks a departure from the central forms of democratic
   governance over the past two centuries. As opposed to the primacy of the
   legislative branch and of institutional actors, most notably political
   parties, populism tends toward the unilateral authority of a charismatic
   leader, ruling on the basis of an electoral mandate. This article starts
   from an understanding of populism as being grounded in political
   mobilization in disregard of the institutions of governance. Even more
   centrally, populist leaders try to dismantle institutional constraints
   to allow for greater individual discretionary power. This article looks
   to legal vulnerabilities that might allow the institutional framework of
   democracy to withstand the new populist assault. The central insight is
   that corruption might prove the means of checking governance by the new
   breed of caudillos, the strongman rule that stands in opposition to
   separation of powers limitations on the executive. Two forms of
   corruption are examined. The first is the attempt to subordinate the
   electoral system itself. The second is the use of state discretionary
   authority to push the boundaries of clientelism and ultimately outright
   corruption. Whereas questions of electoral integrity are more commonly
   checked by formal constitutional boundaries, the question of ordinary
   corruption surfaces with regularity under populism. The article offers
   reasons why this might be the product of a descent from clientelism to
   cronyism to outright capture of public resources for private gain. In
   turn, the article offers arguments for how corruption invites review by
   broader layers of judicial and prosecutorial authorities than
   constitutional law.}},

Title = {{COVID-19 Outbreak in Post-Soviet States: Modeling the Best and Worst
   Possible Scenarios}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: COVID-19 pandemic has presented extreme challenges to
   developing countries across the world. The aim of this paper was to
   provide estimates for current development COVID-19 pandemic in the
   Post-Soviet states and forecast potential best and worst scenarios for
   spread of this deadly infection.
   Methods: The data on COVID-19 cases extracted from official governmental
   sources until April 18, 2020. A modified SEIR
   (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) modelling was used to plot the
   pandemic outbreak in 10 Post-Soviet states and forecasting over the
   period of 10, 30 and 60 days. The optimal measures (best-scenario) and
   suboptimal measures (worst-scenarios) of potential spread of COVID-19 in
   these countries were estimated.
   Results: It was estimated that Armenia and Azerbaijan have reached their
   peaks, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and Uzbekistan are expected to
   reach their peaks in the early May-2020), with comparatively low cases
   of COVID-19 in the best-case scenario. In contrast, Belarus, Russia, and
   Ukraine would likely see the outbreaks with the largest number of
   COVID-19 cases amongst the studied Post-Soviet States in the
   worst-scenario during the next 30 and 60 days.
   Conclusion: Governmental response was shown to be as an important
   determining factor responsible for the development of COVID-19 epidemic
   in Post-Soviet states. The current protection rates should be maintained
   to reduce active cases during upcoming 30 and 60 days. The estimated
   possible scenarios based on the proposed model can potentially be used
   by healthcare professionals from each studied Post-Soviet States as well
   as others to improve plans to contain the current and future epidemic.}},

Title = {{Soil carbon sequestration simulated in CMIP6-LUMIP models: implications
   for climatic mitigation}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Land-use change affects both the quality and quantity of soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and leads to changes in ecosystem functions such as
   productivity and environmental regulation. Future changes in SOC are,
   however, highly uncertain owing to its heterogeneity and complexity. In
   this study, we analyzed the outputs of simulations of SOC stock by Earth
   system models (ESMs), most of which are participants in the Land-Use
   Model Intercomparison Project. Using a common protocol and the same
   forcing data, the ESMs simulated SOC distribution patterns and their
   changes during historical (1850-2014) and future (2015-2100) periods.
   Total SOC stock increased in many simulations over the historical period
   (30 +/- 67 Pg C) and under future climate and land-use conditions (48
   +/- 32 Pg C for ssp126 and 49 +/- 58 Pg C for ssp370). Land-use
   experiments indicated that changes in SOC attributable to land-use
   scenarios were modest at the global scale, in comparison with climatic
   and rising CO2 impacts, but they were notable in several regions. Future
   net soil carbon sequestration rates estimated by the ESMs were roughly
   0.4 parts per thousand yr(-1) (0.6 Pg C yr(-1)). Although there were
   considerable inter-model differences, the rates are still remarkable in
   terms of their potential for mitigation of global warming. The disparate
   results among ESMs imply that key parameters that control processes such
   as SOC residence time need to be better constrained and that more
   comprehensive representation of land management impacts on soils remain
   critical for understanding the long-term potential of soils to sequester
   carbon.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the history of Japanese foreign exchange interventions from
   1971 to 2018. First, we provide the best proxy for monthly interventions
   for the period from 1971 to 1990, when the intervention timings and
   amounts were not officially disclosed. The accuracy of the proxy is
   tested for the period when the statistics were disclosed after 1991. The
   proxy explains 99.8\% of actual settlement-based interventions. Second,
   we examine conditions under which the Japanese monetary authorities are
   likely to intervene by estimating a policy reaction function, using the
   long-term data, spanning the period when intervention data have been
   officially disclosed and the period where our proxy is available. Third,
   we analyze intervention timings and amounts for Japan, the US, and
   Germany. Fourth, we present the episode of international coordination
   represented by the Plaza and Louvre agreements as a case study of
   notable interventions during the period.}},

Abstract = {{The article explores the economic and social situation in Latin America
   after the ``golden decade{''} (2003-2013) and political shifts in the
   region. During the last electoral cycle, the region witnessed a certain
   political landscape transformation, including the ``right drift{''} on
   the one hand and the strengthening of the positions of the left forces
   on the other. Thus, political polarization at the national and regional
   levels sharply increased, integration blocks have disintegrated or are
   in crisis. As a result, the region is no longer a ``unity in
   diversity{''}. The author highlights the reasons for the intensification
   of European politics in Latin America. Although the economy remains a
   priority in interregional cooperation, political aspects are becoming
   increasingly important. Both regions actively cooperate in solving
   global problems, but their priorities differ significantly. The European
   Union cooperates with Latin America in strengthening multilateralism and
   improving global governance, both partners try to reform international
   institutions, reject protectionism and underline the priority of
   international law.}},

Abstract = {{Modification of dairy products' fat composition or replacement by other
   fats are common practices in the industry. Products in which milkfat is
   partially or wholly substituted by vegetable fats are defined as dairy
   analogues. This study delivers gap-filling information about sour cream
   analogues in nutritional aspects, focusing on the fat-related
   attributes. Analogue sour creams contained 29.6\% less saturated fatty
   acids, 88.4\% less cholesterol and 88.7\% more mono- and
   poly-unsaturated fatty acids than the sour creams. Trans fatty acids
   were present in both products, which could not be linked to artificial
   hydrogenation in either case. Digestibility of the examined samples
   might be different, as sour creams had more short and medium chain fatty
   acids than the analogues. Overall, sour cream analogues, besides serving
   as an alternative to sour cream, have particular advantages based on
   their nutritional values.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The left internal thoracic artery (LITA) to left anterior
   descending (LAD) artery bypass remains the reference standard for
   coronary artery bypass graft surgery. With the advent of bilateral
   internal thoracic artery (BITA) grafting, optimal bypass configuration
   to the LAD is unclear. The objective of this study was to compare
   clinical outcomes between LITA-LAD and right internal thoracic artery
   (RITA)-LAD configurations in BITA grafting.
   Methods. The primary outcome was the need for percutaneous or surgical
   reintervention of the LAD. Secondary outcomes included all-cause
   mortality and cardiac mortality. Cox proportional hazard and competing
   risk models were used with entropy weighting.
   Results. Among BITA patients, 1527 had LITA-LAD grafts, and 523
   RITA-LAD. Before entropy weighting, RITA-LAD patients were older with
   more diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and left ventricular
   dysfunction, more urgent status (P < .05), and more frequently performed
   off-pump (P < .001). Need for repeat revascularization of the LAD
   territory at 10 years was 2.8\% in the LITA-LAD group and 1.8\% in the
   RITA-LAD group (subhazard ratio = 0.686; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 0.296-1.589; P = .38). Adjusted survival at 10 years was 97.2\%
   in the LITA-LAD group and 98.2\% in the RITA-LAD group (hazard ratio =
   1.056; 95\% CI, 0.677-1.647; P = .81). There was no difference in
   cardiac mortality (subhazard ratio = 1.063; 95\% CI, 0.502-2.251; P =
   .87).
   Conclusions. Use of either LITA or RITA for LAD grafting during BITA
   revascularization has no effect on long-term all-cause or cardiac
   mortality or need for repeat revascularization of the LAD. Cardiac
   surgeons should be confident in using a RITA-LAD bypass during BITA
   grafting. (C) 2020 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons}},

Title = {{The Promise of a Multi-Disciplinary, Mixed-Methods Approach to Inform
   Insect Pest Management: Evidence From Wyoming Alfalfa}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Pest management strategies involve a complex set of considerations,
   circumstances, and decision-making. Existing research suggests that
   farmers are reflexive and reflective in their management choices yet
   continue to employ curative rather than preventative strategies, and opt
   for chemical over biological solutions. In this piece, we detail work
   from a two-year, multidisciplinary, mixed-methods study of insect pest
   management strategies in alfalfa in Wyoming, integrating data from four
   focus groups, a statewide survey, and biological sampling of production
   fields. We outline how these different sources of data together
   contribute to a more complete understanding of the challenges and
   strategies employed by farmers, and specifically on biological pest
   control. We applied this approach across alfalfa hay and seed crop
   systems. Relatively few farmers acknowledged biological control in focus
   groups or surveys, yet biological exploration yielded abundant
   parasitism of common pest alfalfa weevil. On the other hand, parasitism
   of seed alfalfa pest Lygus was far less common and patchy across fields.
   It is only in integrating quantitative and qualitative, biological and
   social data that we are able to generate a more complete portrait of the
   challenges and opportunities of working with farmers to embrace a
   preventative paradigm. In doing so, we offer insights on possible
   barriers to the adoption of preventative insect management strategies
   and provide a case study of integrating social science and biophysical
   techniques to better understand opportunities to expand biological pest
   control in cropping systems.}},

Title = {{iSignDB: A database for smartphone signature biometrics}},
Journal = {{DATA IN BRIEF}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{33}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The signature has long been in use for the user verification. These
   signatures have user specific features that differentiate the individual
   for authentication. The signature verification can be offline or online.
   The offline verification considers only the static features of the
   signatures through the signature image, while the online verification
   considers various dynamic features associated with the signature such as
   pen pressure, pen tilt angle, velocity, acceleration, pen up and pen
   down, etc at various time stamps which are recorded using special
   digitizing tablets such as Wacom devices (STU-500, STU-530 and DTU-1031)
   {[}1,14] etc. In to-days scenario, smartphones are widely used
   world-wide, and come equipped with various sensors e.g. accelerometer,
   gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, etc. able to capture sensor logs and have
   been used widely in the literature to capture the dynamics of users'
   behaviour while a signer signs on his smartphone. However, there is
   scarcity of publicly available databases for the online signatures
   collected using smartphone. In the present work, we describe biometric
   signature dataset iSignDB captured using smartphone.
   The iSignDB {[}6,10] consists of the genuine signature samples of a user
   as well as the skilled forgery samples where imposter was given multiple
   attempts to mimic the mannerisms of the original signer before giving
   skilled forgery samples. A total of 30 samples towards the genuine
   signature over 3 sessions with 10 samples per session while 15 samples
   of the skilled forgery with 5 samples per session were collected. Each
   of the session were at least 15 days apart. The iOS and Android based
   smartphones (namely iPhone7 and Redmi Note 7) were used for the data
   collection.
   The sensors used to collect this data, present in the smartphone are the
   gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, and accelerometer. Smartphones having
   sensors any one lesser than these four, were not used for data
   collection, in order to have consistent number of features under each
   sample. They generate the following sensor readings: angular velocity,
   acceleration, orientation, geomagnetic field in the x, y, and z
   directions, position, which is collected using the MATLAB Mobile App
   installed in the smartphone, that sends the data to a licensed MathWorks
   cloud account in the form of a multitude of sensor logs. Each sample has
   image of the signature along with sensor readings.
   Some of the publicly available smartphone biometric signature databases
   are DooDB {[}2], MOBISIG {[}3], eBioSign DS 2 {[}7], etc. in which at
   least acceleration sensor reading is present but the iSignDB ensures
   these five of the sensor readings (acceleration, angular velocity,
   magnetic field, orientation, position) under each sample. This dataset
   can be successfully used to design smartphone biometric signature
   authentication system which is robust against a number of spoof attacks
   {[}11-14]. As every user has a unique way of handling his/her smartphone
   which varies over different level of emotional intelligence of the user
   over a time period, this dataset can also be used for behavioural
   analysis of the users. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Household food insecurity and preschool suspension/expulsion in the
   United States}},
Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{141}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Food insecurity is a serious public health concern, affecting
   approximately 15 million children in the U.S. alone. Exposure to
   household food insecurity has been linked to a host of deleterious
   outcomes among infants and children, including mental and behavioral
   health outcomes. Even so, scholars have yet to examine the connection
   between household food insecurity and early experiences of school
   punishment among preschool-aged children. The current study employs a
   nationally representative sample of 6100 preschool-aged children from
   the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. Difference-of-means
   t-tests and multivariate logistic regression models examining the link
   between mild and moderate-to-severe household food insecurity and
   suspension/ expulsion among preschool-aged children were conducted in
   2020. All estimates were calculated using sample weights that adjust for
   nonresponse, probability of selection, and the demographic distribution
   of the target population (i.e., U.S. children attending preschool in
   2016). The findings indicate a robust association between
   moderate-to-severe household food insecurity and suspension/expulsion
   among preschool-aged children. This association emerged only among male
   children, as their risk of suspension/expulsion increased more than
   11fold in the presence of moderate-to-severe food insecurity. Additional
   analyses revealed that a large portion of this association was
   attenuated upon accounting for parenting stress and child mental health.
   Trauma-informed nutrition assistance programming as well as early mental
   health assessment and consultation may yield collateral benefits in the
   form of reductions in preschool suspension/expulsion. Given the
   findings, moreover, future research should consider the role of
   household food insecurity in contributing to health inequities that
   perpetuate the school-to-prison pipeline.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Some evidence suggests the association between body mass
   index (BMI) and pancreatic cancer risk is weaker among current smokers
   than among never smokers.
   Methods: We examined the association between BMI and pancreatic cancer
   mortality among adults who reported smoking status at enrollment into
   Cancer Prevention Study-II in 1982, including 420,543 never smokers,
   282,244 former cigarette smokers, and 219,885 current cigarette smokers.
   After excluding the first 3 years of follow-up to reduce reverse
   causation, we calculated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR).
   Results: During the full follow-up period from 1985 to 2014, 7,904
   participants died of pancreatic cancer. The HR per 5 BMI units was lower
   among current smokers {[}HR = 1.14; 95\% confidence interval (CI),
   1.07-1.20] than never smokers (HR = 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.17-1.27), although
   this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). BMI was
   significantly less strongly associated with pancreatic cancer mortality
   among current smokers reporting >= 20 cigarettes/day (HR = 1.10; 95\%
   CI, 1.03-1.18) than among never smokers. During follow-up within 10
   years of enrollment, when current smokers at enrollment were the most
   likely to have still been smoking, BMI was not associated with
   pancreatic cancer mortality among current smokers (HR = 1.02; 95\% CI,
   0.90-1.16, P = 0.03 for difference between current and never smokers).
   BMI HRs were similar among former and never smokers.
   Conclusions: These results support a weaker association between BMI and
   pancreatic cancer among current smokers than among never smokers.
   Impact: In populations with low smoking prevalence, the pancreatic
   cancer burden due to BMI is likely to be higher than that predicted by
   risk estimates from studies including substantial numbers of smokers.}},

Title = {{Physician-Estimated Depth as a Screening Tool for Computed Tomography
   Evaluation of Pectus Excavatum}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{256}},
Pages = {{687-692}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pectus excavatum (PE) is the most common congenital chest
   wall anomaly with a reported incidence of 1/300 to 1/400 live births and
   a male predominance. Preoperative evaluation of defect severity
   typically requires a calculation of the Haller index (HI) and/or
   correction index (CI) using computed tomography (CT) or x-rays. The
   purpose of this study was to determine whether physician-estimated depth
   (PED), a bedside screening tool, could be used to identify a subset of
   pediatric patients in whom CT was unnecessary.
   Methods: After institutional review board approval (IRB \#032018-091),
   we retrospectively reviewed all patients with a diagnosis of PE between
   2009 and 2018 at our academic pediatric center. Demographic information
   including age, sex, and body mass index were abstracted. Imaging was
   reviewed to obtain HI and CI and to retrospectively calculate PED. The
   PED is calculated at the bedside by measuring the depth of the pectus at
   the site of greatest depression relative to a horizontal surface laid
   across the deformity. For this retrospective study, we calculated the
   CT-derived PED by measuring the depth from the horizontal on the
   respective CT images. Patients without imaging studies and patients with
   pectus carinatum, arcuatum, or mixed deformities were excluded from this
   study.
   Results: A total of 94 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 82\%
   were male, with a median age of 15 y. Patients were further subdivided
   by BMI, with 46\% of patients having a BMI of <18.5 kg/m(2) (i.e.,
   underweight), whereas 54\% of patients had a BMI of >= 18.5 kg/m(2).
   Using a threshold PED of 2 cm, patients with a BMI of <18.5 kg/m(2) had
   correct classification rates of 93\% and 95\% using PED relative to HI
   and CI, respectively. Patients with a BMI of >= 18.5 kg/m(2) had correct
   classification rates of 80\% and 88\% using PED relative to HI and CI,
   respectively, at the same 2 cm threshold.
   Conclusions: PED is a viable screening tool for the preoperative
   evaluation of PE with a 2 cm threshold providing the combination of high
   sensitivity, specificity, and correct classification rates especially in
   underweight patients. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a review of prognostic methods applied to automotive
   proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). PEMFC durability is strongly
   affected when it is subjected to automotive load cycling (ALC). ALC is
   normally composed of four operation modes such as start-up, idle,
   transient high-current demand and shutdown. All of these operation modes
   drastically change the internal variables of the system like
   temperature, pressure, relative humidity etc. causing degradation of the
   fuel cell components in a short time. Prognostic methods could be a
   possible solution to tackle the PEMFC's low durability issue because
   they allow predicting the remaining useful life of the system in order
   to apply preventive maintenance plans. Therefore, the objective of this
   study is to review the prognostic techniques applied to PEMFC under ALC.
   In the first part of this study, a summary of PEMFC degradation
   mechanisms caused by ALC is realised based on literature review. In the
   second part, the prognostic methods review for automotive PEMFCs is
   carried out and a general synthesis and future challenges are given in
   the third part of the study.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article introduces the late Ahmad Qabel (1958-2012), a new figure
   among contemporary Iranian religious reformers. Qabel, a progressive
   mujtahid, proposed the creative theory of Shari'at-e `Aqlani in order to
   reform stagnant Shari'ah rules and align the application of legal norms
   and precepts with the space-time considerations of modern life. Critical
   of the superficiality of traditional jurists, who led into abeyance the
   progressive rational praxis within classical Shi'i theology and
   jurisprudence, Qabel revived and employed these rational principles in
   his novel method of ijtihad. This paper has four sections: first, there
   will be a short biographical sketch of Ahmad Qabel. The second section
   surveys the trajectory of the development of Shi'i fiqh in order to set
   the backdrop for Qabel's arguments. Then, I will discuss some of the
   major rational principles which constitute the heart of Qabel's
   methodology. In the last section, the practical results of Qabel's
   Shari'at-e `Aqlani are presented through some of his unconventional
   fatwas, which, though solidly based within the Shari'ah, took on
   controversial topics such as women's rights, religious minorities,
   jihad, and Islamic government.}},

   The PeriLeve Device}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Cirrhosis of the liver is often accompanied by refractory ascites, a
   condition characterized by fluid buildup in the peritoneal cavity that
   does not respond to diuretics or recurs shortly after therapeutic
   paracentesis. There are several management strategies in practice
   including large-volume paracentesis, transjugular intrahepatic
   portosystemic shunts, peritoneovenous shunting, and liver transplant.
   However, each of these options come with limitations such as high cost,
   poor efficacy, and increased risk of complications. This article
   explores a new management strategy with a novel biopowered shunt, the
   PeriLeve device, that moves fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the
   urinary bladder using natural changes in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP).
   By doing so, PeriLeve shifts the current paradigm of care from the
   hospital to the home which reduces costs to healthcare providers and
   patients while improving quality of life. The basic design of the pump
   consists of two check (i.e., one-way) valves on either side of a fluid
   filled cavity which is separated from an air cavity by an elastomeric
   membrane. This article presents benchtop testing results of a prototype
   PeriLeve pump. The performance of the pump was analyzed along six
   parameters: change in intra-abdominal pressure, valve opening pressure,
   membrane thickness, membrane stiffness, membrane surface area, and air
   cavity volume. Initial results indicate that, with future optimizations,
   the pump can ultimately move a clinically significant volume of fluid.}},

   socially close individuals are 47\% more likely to make transfers than

   First, sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the variation in
   irreversible loss, total risk level and thermal inventory at different
   evaporator and condenser temperatures with different degrees of overlap
   (decision variables). A total of nine simulations are designed using the
   Taguchi technique. Later, multi-objective optimization is employed. The

Abstract = {{In this work, the n-type single silicon nanowire (NW) based junctionless
   field-effect transistor (FET) is demonstrated as an efficient terahertz
   (THz) detector. For the effective coupling of the THz radiations with NW
   junctionless FET, the lobes of the rounded bow-tie antenna are connected
   to the gate and source terminals of the device. The antenna design is
   optimized with proper impedance matching conditions to achieve maximum
   power transfer between antenna and detector. The simulated antenna
   resonates at 0.43 THz frequency with 19 GHz bandwidth. Further
   simulations have been done on Lumerical finite difference time domain
   software to analyze the electric field distribution profile. To
   investigate the optical response of this optimized antenna design, an
   array of the simulated antenna has been fabricated and its transmission
   spectra are measured. Finally, the simulated antenna has been integrated
   with the n-type NW junctionless transistor. A maximum responsivity of
   468 V W-1 at 0.425 THz frequency and noise-equivalent-power of similar
   to 10(-9)W/Hz(1/2) is obtained at room temperature. The complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor's compatibility, ease of integration on chips,
   possibility to realize multiple pixel arrays, andscalability to higher
   frequencies, make this device promising for THz electronics.}},

Title = {{Fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) associated acute pancreatitis: An ex-vivo
   study using human pancreatic acini}},
Journal = {{PANCREATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background \& aim: Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), are produced by
   non-oxidative alcohol metabolism and can cause acinar cell damage and
   subsequent acute pancreatitis in rodent models. Even though experimental
   studies have elucidated the FAEE mediated early intra-acinar events,
   these mechanisms have not been well studied in humans. In the present
   study, we evaluate the early intra-acinar events and inflammatory
   response in human pancreatic acinar tissues and cells in an ex-vivo
   model.
   Methods: Experiments were conducted using normal human pancreatic
   tissues exposed to FAEE. Subcellular fractionation was performed on
   tissue homogenates and trypsin and cathepsin B activities were estimated
   in these fractions. Acinar cell injury was evaluated by histology and
   immunohistochemistry. Cytokine release from exposed acinar cells was
   evaluated by performing Immuno-fluorescence. Serum was collected from
   patients with AP within the first 72 h of symptom onset for cytokine
   estimation using FACS.
   Results: We observed significant trypsin activation and acinar cell
   injury in FAEE treated tissue. Cathepsin B was redistributed from
   lysosomal to zymogen compartment at 30 min of FAEE exposure. IHC results
   indicated the presence of apoptosis in pancreatic tissue at 1 \& 2hrs of
   FAEE exposure. We also observed a time dependent increase in secretion
   of cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha from FAEE treated acinar tissue.
   There was also a significant elevation in plasma cytokines in patents
   with alcohol associated AP within 72 h of symptom onset.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that alcohol metabolites can cause acute
   acinar cell damage and subsequent cytokine release which could
   eventually culminant in SIRS. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on

Abstract = {{A high numerical aperture (NA) scanning digital oil immersion
   lithography scheme is proposed and demonstrated in this study. To
   successfully conduct the scanning digital oil immersion lithography,
   immersion oil should be removed from the photoresist layer before the

   becomes crucial in the quality of this high NA photolithography. To
   solve these issues, we developed a cleaning procedure for the immersion
   oil and an intensity calibration scheme to achieve a highly uniform
   intensity distribution of the projected patterns. With these
   preparations, we were able to achieve 400 nm resolution large area
   patterning with the developed scanning digital oil immersion lithography
   system and a better than 200 nm resolution in the single line
   patterning. Also, with a double layered photoresist scheme and our
   lab-prepared photoresist, we successfully achieved large area lift-off
   patterns of 400 nm metallic dot arrays through the scanning digital oil

Abstract = {{Background: Bariatric surgery is well established as a treatment for
   obesity and associated complications. This procedure improves metabolic
   homeostasis through changes in energy expenditure. We hypothesized that
   sleeve gastrectomy (SG) improves metabolic homeostasis by modulating
   energy expenditure and enhancing thermogenesis through increasing the
   expression level of meteorin-like protein (METRNL) and fibronectin type
   III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5/Irisin) through uncoupling
   proteins 1/2/3 (UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3).
   Objectives: To study the effect of SG on the levels of proteins involved
   in thermogenesis process.
   Setting: Laboratory rats at Kuwait University.
   Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 4 to 5 weeks, were divided into
   2 groups, control (n = 11) and diet-induced obesity (DIO) (n = 22). The
   control group was fed regular rat chow ad libitum, whereas the DIO group
   was fed cafeteria diet ``high-fat/carbohydrate diet{''} ad libitum. At
   21 weeks, rats in the DIO group that weighed 20\% more than the control
   group animals underwent surgery. These rats were randomly subdivided
   into Sham and SG operation groups. Gene expression was evaluated, and
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were employed to assess the changes
   in gene and protein levels in tissue and circulation.
   Results: The protein expression data revealed an increase in METRNL
   levels in the muscles and white adipose tissue of SG animals. METRNL
   level in circulation in SG animals was reduced compared with control and
   Sham rats. The level of Irisin increased in the muscle of SG animals
   compared with the control and Sham group animals; however, a decrease in
   Irisin level was observed in the white adipose tissue and brown adipose
   tissue of SG animals compared with controls. Gene expression analysis
   revealed decreased METRNL levels in muscle tissues in the SG group
   compared with the control group animals. Increased expression of FNDC5
   (Irisin), UCP2, and UCP3 in the muscle tissue of SG animals was also
   observed. Furthermore, the levels of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, and METRNL in the
   brown adipose tissue of SG animals were upregulated. No significant
   alteration in the gene expression of Irisin was observed in brown
   adipose tissue.
   Conclusions: Sleeve gastrectomy induces weight loss through complex
   mechanisms that may include browning of fat. (C) 2020 American Society

Abstract = {{Spirulina platensis residue (SPR) pyrolysis can produce tar fuels. The
   use of a silica-alumina catalyst will improve fuel quality by reducing
   oxygenate compounds. The kinetics of non-catalytic reactions and SPR
   catalytic pyrolysis have studied using the primary and secondary
   cracking model approaches. Data obtained from a fixed-bed reactor at
   300-600 degrees C is the weight of tar each time, weight gas, and char
   gained at the end of the process. A pyrolysis scheme is made to
   determine the reaction of product formation with primary and secondary
   cracking models. From the calculation of pyrolysis without catalyst, the
   activation energy obtained in primary cracking is E-1, E-2, E-3, while
   for secondary cracking is E-4 and E-5. The optimum condition in primary
   cracking is E-3. The SPR reaction becomes char (B -> C(1)) with the
   lowest activation energy of 15.418 kJ/mol (k(3) in the range of
   0.1044-0.0279 sec(-1)), while for secondary cracking, the tar (1)
   reaction becomes char (T(1)-> C(2)) of 15.151 kJ/mol (k(5) in the range
   1.80.10(-6)-5.48.10(-7)sec(-1)). In pyrolysis with silica-alumina
   catalyst (10, 20 and 40 wt.\%), The more catalyst used, the smaller the
   E-a, and optimal for primary cracking in the use of catalyst 40
   wt.\%,.ie., in the decomposition of SPR to char, E-3 of 3.004 kJ/mol
   (k(3) in the range 0.0616-0.0528 sec(-1)). For secondary cracking in the
   use of catalysts 10, 20, and 40 \%, E-4 and E-5 are relatively high,
   i.e., in the range of 40.855-52.085 kJ/mol (k(4) and k(5) in the range

Abstract = {{Analyzing the vibration characteristics of an underwater rotating
   propeller is crucial for predicting the structural damage of the
   propeller and preventing the failure of an entire propulsion system. The
   laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) measurement technology is a good
   alternative to conventional contact sensors for the analysis of
   underwater structures. In this paper, a tracking LDV technique for the
   vibration measurement of propeller blades that rotate underwater is
   presented. The underwater vibration measurement of a rotating propeller
   is affected by the environmental conditions of the water, cavitation,
   and turbidity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects
   of underwater environmental conditions on the vibration measurement of a
   rotating propeller with the tracking LDV measurement technique. The
   vibration response measurements were performed in a water environment,
   and cavitation bubble and turbidity effects were simulated. To improve
   the quality of the measurement signal, the PCA-based feature extraction
   technique was used to remove abnormal signals including noise and
   irrelevant components and determine the natural frequency of the marine
   propeller. The final results show that the tracking LDV method with
   PCA-based feature extraction is suitable for in-situ health monitoring
   of rotating objects in real underwater environments.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, a novel multinanozyme system was used for the highly
   efficient bio-degradation of organic dye, malachite green, from real
   water media, and ultra-sensitive detection of H2O2 by the simultaneous
   use of MnO2- and SiO2@Fe3O4-nanozymes. The nanozymes were characterized
   for their size, morphology, crystalline structure, and peroxidase-like
   activity. Regard H2O2 detection, a linear range from 1.0-100.0 mu M, and
   a detection limit of 0.26 mu M were achieved. The method exhibited
   ultra-selectivity toward H2O2 detection against co-existing compounds
   and soluble oxygen. Regard, malachite green degradation, upon this
   system, the dye was degraded 99.5\% within 5.0 min which shows an
   excellent improvement for dye removal from water media using the
   multinanozyme system compared to the corresponding single-nanozyme
   systems (50.0\% after 5.0 min). The reusability studies showed that the
   peroxidase-like activity of the multinanozyme system was stabled for 10
   and 15 reuses toward dye degradation and H2O2 determination,
   respectively. Kinetics and adsorption isotherms for malachite green
   removal using the multinanozyme system were also evaluated, revealing a
   pseudo-first-order kinetics and Langmuir adsorption model for dye
   degradation. The method was successfully applied for H2O2 quantification
   in milk samples and organic dye degradation from real water media.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to develop edible, fast dissolving,
   sealable whey protein isolate (WPI)-based films for packaging
   premeasured dry foods/ingredients that will dissolve and release their
   contents upon contact with water. Modifications to the structure and
   properties of WPI films via heat-denaturation and plasticizers were
   determined. The structure-function relationship of the films was
   elucidated based on FTIR analysis. The developed water-soluble native
   WPI (NWPI) films had similar visual and barrier properties (oxygen
   permeability 4.74 x 10(-4) to 12.26 x 10(-4) cm(3) mu m/m(2).s.kPa and
   water vapor permeability 0.0113-0.0148 g mm/m(2).s.kPa) but lower
   mechanical properties (tensile strength 1.04-3.16 MPa, \% elongation
   7.45-15.31\%, and elastic modulus 18.88-105.34 MPa) than the
   water-insoluble heat-denatured WPI films. The solution-sealed NWPI
   pouches of dry food models showed ready solubility. Heat denaturation
   strengthened the cohesion of the WPI films via the enhanced formation of
   the intermolecular beta-sheet. Glycerol and atmospheric moisture showed
   plasticizing effects on both the barrier and tensile properties, which
   correlated well with the films' moisture sorption isotherms.
   Solution-sealed NWPI pouches can be potentially used as leave-in
   packaging for portioned dry foods. The comprehensive understanding of
   the properties of glycerol-plasticized WPI films gained from this study
   is valuable in designing WPI-based packaging for commercial packaged
   food systems.}},

Title = {{Mercury exposure in relation to sleep duration, timing, and
   fragmentation among adolescents in Mexico City}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{191}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Mercury intoxication is known to be associated with
   adverse symptoms of fatigue and sleep disturbances, but whether
   low-level mercury exposure could affect sleep remains unclear. In
   particular, children may be especially vulnerable to both mercury
   exposures and to poor sleep. We sought to examine associations between
   mercury levels and sleep disturbances in Mexican youth.
   Methods: The study sample comprised 372 youth from the Early Life
   Exposures to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohort, a birth cohort
   from Mexico City. Sleep (via 7-day actigraphy) and concurrent urine
   mercury were assessed during a 2015 follow-up visit. Mercury was also
   assessed in mid-childhood hair, blood, and urine during an earlier study
   visit, and was considered a secondary analysis. We used linear
   regression and varying coefficient models to examine non-linear
   associations between Hg exposure biomarkers and sleep duration, timing,
   and fragmentation. Unstratified and sex-stratified analyses were
   adjusted for age and maternal education.
   Results: During the 2015 visit, participants were 13.3 +/- 1.9 years,
   and 48\% were male. There was not a cross-sectional association between
   urine Hg and sleep characteristics. In secondary analysis using earlier
   biomarkers of Hg, lower and higher blood Hg exposure was associated with
   longer sleep duration among girls only. In both boys and girls, Hg
   biomarker levels in 2008 were associated with later adolescent sleep
   midpoint (for Hg urine in girls, and for blood Hg in boys). For girls,
   each unit log Hg was associated with 0.2 h later midpoint (95\% CI 0 to
   0.4), and for boys each unit log Hg was associated with a 0.4 h later
   sleep midpoint (95\% CI 0.1 to 0.8).
   Conclusions: There were mostly null associations between Hg exposure and
   sleep characteristics among Mexican children. Yet, in both boys and
   girls, higher Hg exposure in mid-childhood (measured in urine and blood,
   respectively) was related to later sleep timing in adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Mg-Fe catalysts with various molar ratio (Mg/Fe
   1:1-10:1), prepared by calcination and subsequent rehydration of
   hydrotalcite structures, were characterized, tested and evaluated as
   suitable catalysts for the aldol condensation of furfural with acetone.
   XRD analyses confirmed that the layered structure was completely
   restored by rehydration in the catalysts with Mg:Fe molar ratio 3:1 and
   4:1. TPD-CO2 showed that the catalysts of this molar ratio had the
   highest basicity. Rehydrated Mg-Fe catalysts were tested in aldol
   condensation carried out in a glass batch reactor at 60 degrees C,
   atmospheric pressure, 2 wt\% of catalyst and acetone/furfural molar
   ratio 10:1. The catalysts with Mg/Fe molar ratio of 3:1 and 4:1 showed
   total furfural conversion. As high basicity causes a high activity of
   the catalyst, our results suggest that the rehydrated mixed oxides with
   molar ratio 3 to 4:1 were promising new catalysts for the aldol

Abstract = {{The emergence, growth and sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI)
   and computer-generated works (CGW), have opened the discussion towards
   the property and accountability of creations made by machines. These
   creations, founded on algorithms and learning-processes based on large
   data analysis may become instrumental, or even independent, in the
   creative processes. The ownership of these creations comprises a
   challenge for intellectual property (IP) regulations as, traditionally,
   the concept of author has been associated to human inventions. This
   paper attempts to analyse the state-of-the-art and expand the literature
   regarding AI's copyright protection. For this purpose, through an
   extensive literature review, we identify the main concepts regarding
   AI's copyright protection in order to establish an analytic framework to
   study current regulations at an international and domestic level. This
   allows us to set the parameters to compare if, and how, these key
   concepts have been incorporated or interpreted in policymaking. The
   absence of an international consensus regarding the authorship
   concept-leaving it to domestic interpretation- may lead to contradictory
   norms causing uncertainty in terms of their protection. We propose the
   recognition of Artificial Intelligence Generated Works (AIGW) as a new
   conceptual category, and its protection through a new sui generis
   legislation.}},

Abstract = {{A man in his early 50s presented with jaundice, mild shortness of breath
   on exertion and dark urine. He had had coryzal symptoms 2weeks prior to
   admission. Medical history included obstructive sleep apnoea and
   hypertension. His initial blood tests showed a mild hyperbilirubinaemia
   and acute kidney injury stage 1. Chest X-ray and CT pulmonary angiogram
   were negative for features suggestive of COVID-19. He later developed a
   drop in haemoglobin and repeat bloods showed markedly raised lactate
   dehydrogenase and positive direct antiglobulin test. These results were
   felt to be consistent with a haemolytic anaemia. A nasopharyngeal swab
   came back positive for COVID-19. We suspect the cause of his symptoms
   was an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia secondary to COVID-19 which has
   recently been described in European cohorts.}},

Journal = {{GENE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Loss of function and progressive death of neurons, the pathological
   mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) can occur as a result of
   apoptotic unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling induced by
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress resulting from misfolded protein
   accumulation in ER lumen. Non-enzymatic glycation of proteins have been
   implicated in the pathophysiology of NDDs and are known to cause
   cellular oxidative stress leading to ER stress mediated neuronal
   apoptosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), post transcriptional regulators of gene
   expression are identified as regulators of UPR and the altered brain
   miRNA profiles in NDDs suggest the involvement of miRNA dysregulation in
   neuronal death. L-ascorbic acid, a micro nutrient and an important
   neuroprotectant has been suggested to be a modulator of gene expression.
   However there are few reports on miRNAs targeting the genes involved in
   neuronal apoptotic UPR signaling as well as L-ascorbic acid mediated
   regulation of neuronal UPR pathway and miRNA expression. Here, we
   identified a statistically significant downregulation of 7 miRNAs such
   as mmu-miR-24, 27b, 124, 224, 290, 351 and 488 and inverse expression
   relationship with their UPR related targets such as Perk, Ire1 alpha,
   Chop and Puma during advanced glycated BSA (AGE-BSA) induced ER stress
   in Mus musculus cortical and hippocampal neurons. We also observed that
   a pretreatment with L-ascorbic acid alleviated AGE-BSA induced neuronal
   ER stress as well as the downregulation of the 7 potential miRNAs.}},

Title = {{Adaptive and distributed operation of HVAC systems: Energy and comfort
   implications of active diffusers as new adaptation capacities}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{186}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Human-aware HAVC operations have been shown to be effective in improving
   energy efficiency, which is constrained by the HVAC system configuration
   and operational logic. These constraints can result in a lack of
   operational flexibility, which in turn reduces the adaptation capacity
   for energy efficiency. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the
   energy efficiency implications of novel adaptive capacities for HVAC
   including the use of proposed active diffusers, which add to the
   dynamics of the HAVC systems by adjusting the behavior of diffusers
   using two modalities of (1) binary actuation of air flow (turning flow
   on and off), and (2) adjusting the flow direction to target individual
   needs in an environment. Computational fluid dynamics was used to model
   and simulate the behavior of a ``real-world{''} thermal zone to evaluate
   five scenarios of adaptive operations using distributed feedback from
   the environment, as well as active diffusers. Three scenarios used
   binary actuation at the thermal zone (collection of rooms) level, and
   two examined the adaptive operations at the diffusers level. Moreover,
   we examined the integration of distributed feedback at occupant
   locations into the control loop using averaged temperatures (in the
   first three scenarios) and individual-level feedback (in scenarios with
   diffuser level actuation). The coupling of distributed feedback and
   independent directional flow at the diffuser level considerably improved
   thermal comfort while reducing energy demands by similar to
   25\%-reflecting a considerable impact on improved energy efficiency.
   These findings demonstrate the potentials that artificial intelligence
   frameworks could bring about by enabling autonomous adaptive operations.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Salivary cortisol is used as an indicator of stress level
   and a recommended screening test for Cushing syndrome. The normal
   reference interval for salivary cortisol is dependent on the analytical
   methodology and the population studied and hence, establishment of a
   local population-based reference interval is recommended. Materials and
   methods: A total of 129 healthy blood donors and staffs of Penang
   General Hospital were recruited from June 2018-May 2019. Paired (morning
   and late-night) saliva samples were collected from individuals aged
   between 18 and 60 years old with no history of chronic medical illness.
   Salivary cortisol was assayed using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay
   technique. Non-parametric statistics were used for calculation of
   reference interval and 90\% confidence intervals (90\% Cls). Results:
   The reference interval for morning and late-night salivary cortisol was
   2.09 - 22.63 nmol/L and <12.00 nmol/L, respectively. Conclusion: The
   locally-derived adult reference intervals for morning and late-night
   salivary cortisol concentration was determined and varied with previous
   studies emphasising the need in establishing individual laboratory
   reference interval.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
   distribution, epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) values and clinical
   breakpoints (CBPs) of nemonoxacin, a non-fluorinated quinolone, for
   community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)-related Streptococcus pneumoniae and
   Staphylococcus aureus.
   Methods: We pooled the susceptibility and clinical data of CAP patients
   enrolled in five clinical trials conducted in three countries from 2006
   to 2017. Published pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of oral (500 mg) and
   intravenous (IV) (500, 650 and 750 mg) nemonoxacin formulations and
   pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of the two aforementioned CAP-related
   Gram-positive cocci (GPC) were used to determine plausible CBPs.
   Moreover, nemonoxacin MIC distributions of CAP-relatedS. pneumoniae (n =
   1800) and S. aureus (n = 2000) isolates were obtained to evaluate ECOFF
   values using a visual estimation approach and ECOFFinder.
   Results: More than 92\% of patients with CAP caused byS. pneumoniae or
   S. aureus with nemonoxacin MICs <= 0.25 mg/L presented positive clinical
   and microbiological outcomes. The ECOFF, MIC90 and MIC99 values of
   nemonoxacin were, respectively, 0.06, 0.125 and 1 mg/L for S. pneumoniae
   and 0.125,1 and 8 mg/L for S. aureus. Based on differences in the PK
   profiles of oral and IV formulations, PD parameters of nemonoxacin for
   these CAP-GPC and clinical in vivo efficacy data, tentative CBPs of 0.5,
   0.5 and 1 mg/L, respectively, were established for the 500 mg oral and
   500 mg and 750 mg IV nemonoxacin formulations for S. pneumoniae, and
   0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/L for S. aureus.
   Conclusion: This study provides plausible nemonoxacin CBPs for two
   important CAP-GPC. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Title = {{Adsorption and photocatalytic characteristics of cobalt ferrite-reduced
   graphene oxide and cobalt ferrite-carbon nanotube nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{In this research, cobalt ferrite (CF)-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and
   CF-carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposites were successfully prepared
   through a facile co-precipitation method at a low temperature. The
   structure, microstructure, magnetic, optical and photocatalytic
   properties of the as-prepared nanocomposite samples were characterized
   by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy
   (FESEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), diffuse reflectance
   spectroscopy (DRS), Photoluminescence (PL) spectrometer and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The mean particle size and
   saturation magnetization were decreased by the addition of rGO and CNT
   to the CF. The band gap of the CF decreased from 1.55 to 1.50 and 1.45
   eV in presence of rGO and CNT, respectively. The recombination rate of
   photo-induced electronhole pairs was further decreased by CNT compared
   to the rGO. A detailed study on the mechanism and kinetics of dark
   adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) aqueous
   solutions by different samples was done. The degradation results were
   fitted with a high degree of correlation to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
   (L-H) model and those for adsorption to the Langmuir model. CF-CNT
   nanocomposite showed the highest dark adsorption capacity and MB
   degradation efficiency in all MB concentrations. For the degradation of
   10 mg/L methylene blue (MB) solution under visible light, the
   photocatalytic efficiency of CF-CNT nanocomposite reached 97\% within
   180 min of reaction time, which was 1.8 times higher than that of CF-rGO
   nanocomposite and up to 2.5 times than that for pure CF nanoparticles.
   The remarkable visible light photocatalytic performance CF-CNT
   nanocomposite with a maximum kinetic rate constant was mainly attributed
   to the structural, morphological and optical properties. According to
   the reusability test, only a slight decrease of 4\% was observed after
   the third cycle.}},

Title = {{The effects of a goal-framing and need-supportive app on undergraduates'
   intentions, effort, and achievement in mobile science learning}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{159}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study we investigate the effect of manipulating intrinsic goals,
   relative to extrinsic goals, in a mobile learning tool and traditional
   textbook for biology students. Using Self- Determination Theory, we
   hypothesized that framing intrinsic goals in a need-supportive mobile
   learning app would enhance motivation, intentions, effort, and
   achievement, relative to extrinsic goals in a traditional tool
   (textbook). We randomized 128 undergraduate students learning to
   identify species in this 2 x 2 experiment. Using Bayesian analyses,
   results show a credible interaction effect between the mobile app and
   intrinsic goal-framing for intentions and identified regulation. For
   effort and achievement, the main effect of mobile learning is credible
   with substantial effect sizes. We argue that these findings are due to
   the need-supportive features within the mobile app and need-satisfying
   experience of pursuing intrinsic goals. For intrinsic motivation and
   amotivation, however, extrinsic goal-framing and intrinsic goal-framing,
   respectively, are credible and positive main effects, which is
   unexpected. More research is needed to investigate if this contradictory
   finding is replicated by others, or if students are pursuing extrinsic
   goals for autonomous motivation. Bayesian multigroup path analysis found
   across both groups that identified regulation predicted intentions, and
   intrinsic motivation predicted effort and achievement. For the extrinsic
   goal-framing group, amotivation predicted achievement, identified
   regulation predicted effort and achievement, and intrinsic motivation
   negatively predicted intentions. The results of our study provide
   theoretical implications for how goal-framing energizes different types
   of motivation within the mLearning context, and how manipulation within
   technology may have a differential effect on motivation than a physical
   agent.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the use of coal bottom ash (bottom ash) and
   CaO-CaCl2-activated ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) binder
   in the manufacturing of artificial fine aggregates using cold-bonded
   pelletization. Mixture samples were prepared with varying added contents
   of bottom ash of varying added contents of bottom ash relative to the
   weight of the cementless binder (= GGBFS + quicklime (CaO) + calcium
   chloride (CaCl2)). In the system, the added bottom ash was not simply an
   inert filler but was dissolved at an early stage. As the ionic
   concentrations of Ca and Si increased due to dissolved bottom ash,
   calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) formed both earlier and at higher
   levels, which increased the strength of the earlier stages. However, the
   added bottom ash did not affect the total quantities of main reaction
   products, C-S-H and hydrocalumite, in later phases (e.g., 28 days), but
   simply accelerated the binder reaction until it had occurred for 14
   days. After considering both the mechanical strength and the pelletizing
   formability of all the mixtures, the proportion with 40 relative weight
   of bottom ash was selected for the manufacturing of pilot samples of
   aggregates. The produced fine aggregates had a water absorption rate of
   9.83\% and demonstrated a much smaller amount of heavy metal leaching
   than the raw bottom ash.}},

Abstract = {{The cemetery at Dvorisce SAZU in Ljubljana, Slovenia, was in use for a
   long period, continuously from the Late Bronze Age into the Early Iron
   Age. More than 300 excavated graves offer a great potential for the
   analysis and discussion of chronological issues, demography, social
   inequalities, funeral attires, as well as burial customs within the Late
   Bronze and Early Iron Age societies. This site was thus chosen as a
   reference point for our pilot study on mobility and migration in
   prehistoric Slovenia. The article presents results of the analysis of
   strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86) performed on the 32 cremated petrous
   part of the temporal bone (pars petrosa) from the cemetery Dvorisce SAZU
   in Ljubljana and 9 animal bones of small mammals from other sites in the
   region for baseline information. The stable isotope analysis and the
   study of mobility in the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age presented
   here is one of the first such investigations involving the osteological
   material from the southeastern Alpine region.}},

Title = {{Nd, SbNd and Sb3Nd4 and their interactions with the cladding alloy HT9}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{541}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Lanthanide fission products, such as neodymium, formed during the
   irradiation of metallic fuels are known to cause deleterious effects
   from chemical interactions occurring at the fuel-cladding interface; a
   phenomenon known as fuel-cladding chemical interaction (FCCI). The use
   of fuel-based additives that bind with the lanthanide elements within
   the fuel meat, alleviating their interactions at the fuel-cladding
   interface, is one potential method proposed to mitigate the FCCI
   phenomenon and extend the burnup potential of such metallic fuel
   systems. In this study, antimony (Sb) is evaluated as one such additive,
   and neodymium (Nd) is used to represent the lanthanides. A Sb-Nd alloy
   is fabricated, which consists of two intermetallic phases, SbNd and
   Sb3Nd4. Isothermal diffusion couple experiments are carried out at 675
   degrees C for 24 h between Nd and the Fe-12Cr based HT9 cladding alloy.
   The results are compared against similar diffusion couple experiments
   carried out between the Sb-Nd alloy and also HT9. Inter-diffusion
   between Nd/HT9 diffusion couple is characterized and the phases Fe17Nd5
   and Fe17Nd2 were found to form whereas no interactions were observed in
   the Sb-Nd/HT9 diffusion couple. The lack of compound forming tendencies
   between Fe, the primary alloying constituent of HT9, and SbNd is
   elucidated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations on
   enthalpy of mixing, aligning well with the experimental observations.
   The strong binding of Nd with Sb appears to be favorable, alleviating Nd
   interactions with HT9 constituent elements. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

   fluoroscopy time, radiation dose and ablation counts were measured and
   compared between the groups. Recurrence of AF was evaluated after 6
   months of follow-up.
   Results. Mean procedure times (236.87 +/- 64.31 vs. 147.22 +/- 45.19
   min, P<0.05), counts of RF applications (74.30 +/- 24.77 vs. 49.15 +/-
   20.33, P<0.05) and total RFA times (4323.39 +/- 1426.69 vs. 2780.53 +/-
   1157.85 s, P<0.05) were all significantly higher in the RMN than in the
   MAN group, respectively. In the same order, mean X-ray dose (9722.6 +/-
   7507.4 vs. 8087.9 +/- 6051.5 mGy/cm2, P=0.12) and mean total X-ray
   exposure time (8.07 +/- 4.20 vs. 9.54 +/- 5.47 min, P=0.08) were not
   statistically different. At 6-month follow-up, freedom from AF was
   similar in RMN and MAN group for paroxysmal (60.8\% and 73\%,
   respectively, P=0.42) and persistent AF (69.6\% and 75.0\%,
   respectively, P=0.77).
   Conclusions. Due to the fact that mid-term clinical outcomes showed no
   significant differences in AF recurrences between groups and manual
   ablation strategy provided more favorable results regarding acute
   procedural parameters, we can conclude that the remote magnetic
   navigation is not superior to the manual approach.}},

Abstract = {{A depth camera outputs an image in which each pixel depicts the distance
   between the camera plane and the corresponding point on the image plane.
   Low-cost depth cameras are becoming commonplace and given their
   applications in the field of machine vision, one must carefully select
   the right device according to the environment in which the camera will
   be used given the accuracy these cameras can be associated with factors
   such as distance from the target, luminosity of the environment, etc.
   This paper aims to compare three depth cameras currently available in
   the market, Intel RealSense D435, which uses stereo vision to compute
   depth at pixels, ASUS Xtion and Microsoft Kinect 2 represent Time of
   flight-based depth cameras. The comparison will be based on how the
   cameras perform at different distances from a flat surface and we will
   check if the colour of the surface affects the depth image quality.}},

Title = {{Gaussian variant of Freivalds' algorithm for efficient and reliable
   matrix product verification}},
Journal = {{MONTE CARLO METHODS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{273-284}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we consider the general problem of checking the
   correctness of matrix multiplication. Given three n x n matrices A, B
   and C, the goal is to verify that A x B = C without carrying out the
   computationally costly operations of matrix multiplication and comparing
   the product A x B with C, term by term. This is especially important
   when some or all of these matrices are very large, and when the
   computing environment is prone to soft errors. Here we extend Freivalds'
   algorithm to a Gaussian Variant of Freivalds' Algorithm (GVFA) by
   projecting the product A x B as well as C onto a Gaussian random vector
   and then comparing the resulting vectors. The computational complexity
   of GVFA is consistent with that of Freivalds' algorithm, which is
   O(n(2)). However, unlike Freivalds' algorithm, whose probability of a
   false positive is 2(-k), where k is the number of iterations, our
   theoretical analysis shows that, when A x B not equal C, GVFA produces a
   false positive on set of inputs of measure zero with exact arithmetic.
   When we introduce round-off error and floating-point arithmetic into our
   analysis, we can show that the larger this error, the higher the
   probability that GVFA avoids false positives. Moreover, by iterating
   GVFA k times, the probability of a false positive decreases as p(k),
   where p is a very small value depending on the nature of the fault on
   the result matrix and the arithmetic system's floating-point precision.
   Unlike deterministic algorithms, there do not exist any fault patterns
   that are completely undetectable with GVFA. Thus GVFA can be used to
   provide efficient fault tolerance in numerical linear algebra, and it
   can be efficiently implemented on modern computing architectures. In
   particular, GVFA can be very efficiently implemented on architectures
   with hardware support for fused multiply-add operations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{55-61}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) with the initial concentration of 5
   mg/L was degraded by UV/H2O2 oxidation process. The removal rate of TCEP
   in the UV/H2O2 system was 89.1\% with the production of Cl- and PO43- of
   0.23 and 0.64 mg/L. The removal rate of total organic carbon of the
   reaction was 48.8\% and the pH reached 3.3 after the reaction. The
   oxidative degradation process of TCEP in the UV/H2O2 system obeyed the
   first order kinetic reaction with the apparent rate constant of 0.0025
   min(-1) (R-2=0.9788). The intermediate products were isolated and
   identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. The addition
   reaction of HO center dot and H2O and the oxidation reaction with H2O2
   were found during the degradation pathway of 5 mg/L TCEP in the UV/H2O2
   system. For the first time, environment risk was estimated via the
   ``ecological structure activity relationships{''} program and acute and
   chronic toxicity changes of intermediate products were pointed out. The
   luminescence inhibition rate of photobacterium was used to evaluate the
   acute toxicity of intermediate products. The results showed that the
   toxicity of the intermediate products increased with the increase of
   reaction time, which may be due to the production of chlorine compounds.
   Some measures should be introduced to the UV/H2O2 system to remove the
   highly toxic Cl-containing compounds, such as a nanofiltration or
   reverse osmosis unit. (C) 2020 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental

Abstract = {{Soilbags have a wide range of applications in geotechnical engineering.
   To explore the compressive strength and deformation behaviour of
   soilbags, a formula for predicting the strength of soilbags is derived
   considering the relationship between the tensile force of the bag and

   simulated using the discrete element method to verify the basic stress
   formula and the derived formula for the tensile force. The results
   indicate that the increase and distribution of the tensile force in the
   bag material have an important effect on the compressive strength of
   soilbags. The derived formula can predict the compressive strength of
   soilbags under vertical loading, providing a theoretical basis and
   design methods for structures built with soilbags.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a Topp-Leone Lindley (TLL) distribution by
   using Topp-Leone (TL) family. Mathematical properties of the TLL
   distribution are studied. Estimation of the unknown parameters is
   derived by the methods of maximum likelihood, least squares and maximum
   product spacings. The performance of the estimation methods is evaluated
   by means of Monte-Carlo simulation. In the application part of the
   research, we have used a long term measured wind speed data from ten
   stations in Inner Mongolia of China. The suitability of the TLL
   distribution and other six distributions (inverse Gaussian,
   Birnbaum-Saunders, power Lindley, weighted Lindley, Weibull, inverse
   Weibull) used to fit for wind speed data is evaluated based on root mean
   square error, coefficient of determination, the log -likelihood, Akaike
   information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC),
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic and power density error. The results
   substantiate that TLL distribution is widely applicable at all selected
   stations. TLL distribution outperforms the others at five stations,
   ranks the second at three stations and classifies as the third in
   remaining two stations. Alternatively, Weighted Lindley distribution is
   the next best distribution for analyzing wind speed data in selected
   stations. It is stronger than others at three stations while ranking the
   second at five stations and fourth in two stations. Although this
   finding questions the accuracy of Weibull distribution in modeling wind
   speed data, it provides superior estimation of wind power density for
   the ten stations. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   but studies have not considered invasive breast cancer and ductal
   carcinoma in situ (DCIS) separately in the same population. We assessed
   the relationship between periodontal disease and breast cancer in a
   large prospective cohort study. The Sister Study followed women without
   prior breast cancer ages 35 to 74 years from 2003 to 2017 (N = 49,968).
   Baseline periodontal disease was self-reported, and incident breast
   cancer was ascertained over a mean follow-up of 9.3 years. We estimated
   hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox
   proportional hazards regression, adjusting for multiple potential
   confounders, including smoking status. Heterogeneity in risk for
   invasive breast cancer versus DCIS was also estimated. About 22\% of
   participants reported a history of periodontal disease at baseline. A
   total of 3,339 incident breast cancers (2,607 invasive breast cancer,
   732 DCIS) were identified. There was no clear association between
   periodontal disease and overall breast cancer risk (HR = 1.02; 95\% CI,
   0.94-1.11). However, we observed a nonstatistically significant
   suggestive increased risk of invasive breast cancer (HR = 1.07; 95\% CI,
   0.97-1.17) and decreased risk of DCIS (HR = 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.72-1.04)
   associated with periodontal disease, with evidence for heterogeneity in
   the risk associations (relative HR for invasive breast cancer versus
   DCIS = 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.52). A case-only analysis for etiologic
   heterogeneity confirmed this difference. We observed no clear
   association between periodontal disease and overall breast cancer risk.
   The heterogeneity in risk associations for invasive breast cancer versus
   DCIS warrants further exploration.}},

Title = {{Preparation and Application of Self-Curing Magnesium Phosphate Cement
   Concrete with High Early Strength in Severe Cold Environments}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The early strength of magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) decreases sharply
   in severe cold environments <=-10 degrees C, with the 2 h compressive
   strength falling to 3.5 MPa at-20 degrees C. Therefore, it cannot be
   used as a repair material for emergency repair construction in such
   environments. In this study, MPC is adapted for use in such cold
   environments by replacing part of the dead-burned magnesia (M) in the
   mixture with a small amount of light-burned magnesia (LBM) and
   introducing dilute phosphoric acid (PA) solution as the mixing water.
   The heat released by the highly active acid-base reaction of PA and LBM
   stimulates an MPC reaction. Moreover, the early strength of the MPC
   significantly improves with the increase in the Mg2+ concentration and
   the initial reaction temperature of the MPC paste, which enables MPC
   hardening in severe cold environments. Although the morphology of the
   reaction products of the MPC is poor and the grain plumpness and size of
   the struvite crystals are remarkably reduced, the early strength of MPC
   prepared in the severe cold environment is close to that of MPC prepared
   under normal temperature. Furthermore, the increases in the early
   reaction temperature and early strength of magnesium phosphate cement
   concrete (MPCC) are significantly improved when the PA concentration in
   the mixing water and the LBM/M ratio are 10\% and 4-6\% at -10 degrees C
   and 20\% and 6-8\% at -20 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, self-curing
   of MPCC can be realized even at -20 degrees C, at which temperature the
   2 h and 24 h compressive strength of MPCC reach 36 MPa and 45 MPa,
   respectively.}},

   strengthens from present-day to +1.5 degrees C, and then weakens until
   +3 degrees C. These changes are characterized by variations in strength
   and location of the core of El Nino-related warming and associated deep
   convection anomalies over the equatorial Pacific leading to circulation
   anomalies across the Asian-Pacific region. Under global warming, the
   ENSO-EAWM relationship is strongly related to the background mean state
   of both the EAWM and ENSO, through changes in the EAWM strength and the
   shift of the ENSO pattern. Anthropogenic aerosols play a key role in
   influencing the ENSO-EAWM relationship under moderate warming (up to 1.5

Title = {{Occurrence and distribution of microplastics in China's largest
   freshwater lake system}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{261}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although microplastics (MPs; < 5 mm) have been recognized as one of the
   most challenging environmental pollutants in the ocean, our
   understanding of the environmental fate of freshwater MPs falls far
   behind, particularly on smaller MPs (<0.1 mm). Here, we seek to reveal
   the latest MP pollution status in the largest freshwater lake of China,
   Poyang Lake, by comprehensively assessing the abundance, distribution,
   size, shape, polymer composition, and micro-morphology of MPs in water
   and sediment, covering a large geographic area of the Lake and its five
   main river tributaries. High levels of MPs were detected in water (up to
   1064 +/- 90 MP/m(3)) and sediment (up to 1936 +/- 121 MP/kg), with the
   highest concentrations in the Gan River and the lowest in the national
   Nature Reserves. While a positive correlation was identified between MP
   abundance in water and sediment, the size distribution of MPs in between
   water and sediment was distinct. The dominant MP form in sediment and
   water was fragment and fiber, respectively. Infrared spectroscopy
   analysis confirmed the dominant polymer types including polypropylene,
   polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl alcohol.
   Moreover, both mu-FTIR and SEM results suggested significant features of
   weathering and fragmentation of MPs. This study provides comprehensive
   data to understand the environmental behavior and pollution magnitude of
   MPs in China's largest freshwater lake and highlights the significant
   contribution of smaller-size fractions (0.03-0.1 mm) to improve future
   MP studies in freshwater systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Magnetic oscillation arc (MOA) technology was developed to avoid
   insufficient fusion defects appearing at the sidewalls in narrow gap gas
   tungsten arc welding (NG-GTAW). In this work, a unified model was
   developed to simulate the process of MOA assisted NG-GTAW. The model
   included the MOA, welding pool, workpiece and the coupling interaction
   between them. The heating characteristic of the MOA and the flow of
   liquid metal were simulated, and the mechanism of forming a uniform
   welding bead under MOA was investigated. It was found that if the
   magnetic flux density increased to 9 mT, the MOA could point to the
   sidewall directly; the maximum heat flux at the bottom declined by
   almost half and at the side, it increased by more than ten times.
   Additionally, the heat flux was no longer concentrated but dispersed
   along the narrow groove face. Under the effect of MOA, there were mainly
   two flow vortexes in the molten pool, which could further increase the
   heat distribution between the bottom, sidewall and corner, and was
   beneficial for the formation of a good-shape weld. The model was
   validated by experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Leg weakness (LW) issues are a great concern for pig breeding industry.
   And it also has a serious impact on animal welfare. To dissect the
   genetic architecture of limb-and-hoof firmness in commercial pigs, a
   genome-wide association study was conducted on bone mineral density
   (BMD) in three sow populations, including Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire.
   The BMD data were obtained by ultrasound technology from 812 pigs
   (including Duroc 115, Landrace 243 and Yorkshire 454). In addition, all
   pigs were genotyped using genome-by-sequencing and a total of 224 162
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. After quality
   control, 218 141 SNPs were used for subsequent genome-wide association
   analysis. Nine significant associations were identified on chromosomes
   3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 18 that passed Bonferroni correction threshold
   of 0.05/(total SNP numbers). The most significant locus that associated
   with BMD (P value = 1.92e(-14)) was detected at approximately 41.7 Mb on
   SSC6 (SSC stands for Sus scrofa chromosome). CUL7, PTK7, SRF, VEGFA,
   RHEB, PRKAR1A and TPO that are located near the lead SNP of significant
   loci were highlighted as functionally plausible candidate genes for sow
   limb-and-hoof firmness. Moreover, we also applied a new method to
   measure the BMD data of pigs by ultrasound technology. The results
   provide an insight into the genetic architecture of LW and can also help
   to improve animal welfare in pigs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an electro-oxidation method to improve the
   photoelectrochemical performance of PbX (X=S, Se, Te) thin films
   electrodeposited onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass. The PbX/ITO
   electrode was electro-oxidized using cyclic voltammetry scanning in the
   potential range of 0-1 V in NaNO3 solution. The photocurrent enhancement
   was observed in the electro-oxidized PbS/ITO, Pb Se/ITO, PbTe/ITO
   electrodes. Among these three electrodes, the electro-oxidized Pb Se/ITO
   electrode exhibited the strongest, most stable and reproducible
   photocurrent. The morphology and composition of the electro-oxidized Pb
   Se/ITO electrode were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). These results indicate that Se was
   formed on the surface of the PbSe thin film after the electro-oxidation.
   The enhancement of photocurrent of the Pb Se/ITO electrode could be
   attributed to the formation of Se-PbSe interface. In a HAc-NaAc buffer
   solution (pH 5.0), the SePb Se/ITO electrode exhibited a good
   photocurrent response to Cu2+ ions, with a dynamic range from 10 nM to
   100 mu M and the limit of detection of 1.2 nM. The common metal ions at
   100 times excess to Cu2+ (10 nM) did not interfere with the detection of
   Cu2+ within an error of 10\%. The proposed method was applied for the
   detection of Cu2+ in municipal tap, river, and pond water samples, and
   the results are consistent with those obtained by atomic absorption
   spectrometry (AAS).}},

Abstract = {{Concrete mortar segregation during vertical pipeline gravity
   transportation will form a weak part in the shaft lining, which poses a
   challenge for deep mine shaft safety. The specific gravity difference
   between aggregate and slurry will cause relative motion; the relative
   velocity is detrimental to the mortar workability, which plays a
   significant role in mortar segregation. A prediction model of the
   relative velocity between slurry and aggregate was proposed and verified
   by numerical simulation results. This approach adopts the interference
   coefficient to revise the aggregate collision loss. The corresponding
   relationship among aggregate relative velocity, mortar rheological
   properties and particle shape was analysed to explain the mortar
   segregation mechanism. Segregation can be prevented by increasing the
   mortar viscosity and shape coefficient and decreasing the density
   difference and aggregate diameter to reduce the relative velocity. This
   work is favourable for concrete mortar quality control for gravity
   transportation and shaft lining construction safety. (C) 2020 The

Title = {{Coral gasdermin triggers pyroptosis}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{54}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Gasdermins are executioners of the inflammatory cell death pathway
   pyroptosis that has so far been studied exclusively in vertebrates. In
   this study, we identified gasdermin E (GSDME) homologs in several
   invertebrate species including corals. We report that coral GSDME was
   cleaved by caspase 3 at two sites, yielding two active isoforms of GSDME
   N-terminal domain that were capable of inducing pyroptosis. Ectopic
   coexpression of coral GSDME and caspase 3 in human cells promoted
   pyroptosis. Corals infected with Vibrio coralliilyticus, a bacterial
   pathogen causing rapid tissue necrosis of corals worldwide, exhibited
   necrotic death with elevated caspase 3 activity and GSDME cleavage,
   whereas inhibition of caspase 3 blocked GSDME cleavage and protected
   corals from necrotic death. These results indicate that functional
   gasdermin exists in invertebrates and that coral gasdermin is involved
   in pathogen-induced coral death. Furthermore, our studies also suggest
   that mediation of pyroptosis is an evolutionarily conserved function of
   gasdermins.}},

Abstract = {{The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed great
   challenges in people's daily lives. Highly sensitive laboratory
   techniques played a critical role in clinical COVID-19 diagnosis and
   management. In this study the feasibility of using a new digital
   PCR-based detection assay for clinical COVID-19 diagnosis was
   investigated by comparing its performance with that of RT-PCR. Clinical
   patient samples and samples obtained from potentially contaminated
   environments were analyzed. The study included 10 patients with
   confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, 32 validated samples of various types
   derived from different clinical timepoints and sites, and 148
   environmentally derived samples. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids were more
   readily detected in respiratory tract samples (35.0\%). In analyses of
   environmentally derived samples, the positivity rate of air samples was
   higher than that of surface samples, probably due to differences in
   virus concentrations. Digital PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in several samples
   that had previously been deemed negative, including 3 patient-derived
   samples and 5 environmentally derived samples. In this study digital PCR
   exhibited higher sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR, suggesting that
   it may be a useful new method for clinical SARS-CoV-2 detection.
   Improvement of SARS-CoV-2 detection would substantially reduce the rates
   of false-negative COVID-19 test results, in particular those pertaining
   to asymptomatic carriers.}},

Title = {{A Guess-And-Determine Attack On SNOW-V Stream Cipher}},

Abstract = {{The 5G mobile communication system is coming with a main objective,
   known also as IMT-2020, that intends to increase the current data rates
   up to several gigabits per second. To meet an accompanying demand of the
   super high-speed encryption, EIA and EEA algorithms face some
   challenges. The 3GPP standardization organization expects to increase
   the security level to 256-bit key length, and the international
   cryptographic field responds actively in cipher designs and standard
   applications. SNOW-V is such a proposal offered by the SNOW family
   design team, with a revision of the SNOW 3G architecture in terms of
   linear feedback shift register (LFSR) and finite state machine (FSM),
   where the LFSR part is new and operates eight times the speed of the
   FSM, consisting of two shift registers and each feeding into the other,
   and the FSM increases to three 128-bit registers and employs two
   instances of full AES encryption round function for update. It takes a
   128-bit IV, employs 896-bit internal state and produces 128-bit
   keystream blocks. The result is competitive in pure software
   environment, making use of both AES-NI and AVX acceleration
   instructions. Thus, the security evaluation of SNOW-V is essential and
   urgent, since there is scarcely any definite security bound for it. In
   this paper, we propose a byte-based guess-and-determine attack on SNOW-V
   with complexity 2(406) using only seven keystream blocks. We first
   improve the heuristic guessing-path auto-searching algorithm based on
   dynamic programming by adding initial guessing set, which is iteratively
   modified by sieving out the unnecessary guessing variables, in order to
   correct the guessing path according to the cipher structure and finally
   launch smaller guessing basis. For the specific design, we split all the
   computing units into bytes and rewrite all the internal operations
   correspondingly. We establish a backward-clock linear equation system
   according to the circular construction of the LFSR part. Then we further
   simplify the equations to adapt to the input requirements of the
   heuristic guessing-path auto-searching algorithm. Finally, the derived
   guessing path needs modification for the pre-simplification and
   post-reduction. This is the first complete guess-and-determine attack on
   SNOW-V as well as the first specific security evaluation to the full
   cipher.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{386}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the mean square admissibility problem for a class
   of stochastic singular systems with Poisson switching. By using
   EL-representation approach, we show the equivalence between mean square
   admissibility and robust admissibility of a deterministic system, which
   is an extension of the result in the case of deterministic system {[}1].
   Based on multiple Lyapunov functions and matrix decomposition
   approaches, some easily verifiable sufficient conditions without
   equality constraint are established and can be conveniently used to
   state feedback controller design. Some admissibility criteria are
   constructed for linear singular systems with Poisson switching. Three
   examples including a RLC circuit and a mass-spring-damper system are
   introduced to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results. (C)

Abstract = {{Background and aims: The bryophyte flora of Argentina is currently under
   study, nevertheless, there are still extensive areas unexplored, such as
   Santiago del Estero with only three records of bryophytes to the entire
   region. The aim of this work was to contribute to the knowledge of the
   moss flora of Santiago del Estero province, through the collection of
   samples in Copo National Park and surroundings.
   M\&M: The specimens were collected in the Copo National Park and
   surroundings, processed and studied according to traditional techniques
   for bryophytes. Microscopic characters were observed with stereoscopic
   and light microscopy. A list of the species found is presented, with
   comments on the differentiating characters, habitat and distribution.
   Results: The following moss taxa were found to be new records for the
   province: Aloina rigida; Dimerodontium balansae; Didymodon umbrosus;
   Fabronia ciliaris; Macrocoma tenuis subsp. sullivantii; Pseudocrossidium
   arenicola; P. linearifolium; Stereophyllum radiculosum; Syntrichia
   chisosa, Trichostomum brachydontium and Venturiella glaziovii. The range
   of distribution of Tricherpodium beccarii is extended to the northeast
   of the province.
   Conclusions: Eleven species and one subspecies, distributed in ten
   genera and five families, are newly reported for the province of
   Santiago del Estero. The range of distribution of one species is
   extended to the northeast of the province. These first studies highlight
   the unexplored floristic richness of the region and its vulnerability
   due to the accelerated advance of the agricultural-livestock border.}},

Abstract = {{In order to identify anti-tubercular agents with a novel scaffold,
   commercial libraries of small organic compounds were screened against a
   fluorescent strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, using a dual

   TTCA were further synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory effects
   on M. tuberculosis H37Rv. In the present study we report the
   structure-activity relationship of these TTCA derivatives. Compounds 28,
   32 and 42 displayed good anti-tubercular activities, as well as
   favorable ADME and PK properties. Compound 42 exhibited excellent oral
   bioavailability in mice with high distribution to lungs, within 1 h. It
   was found to be efficacious in a dose dependent manner in a murine model
   of M. tuberculosis infection. Hence, compound 42 is now under evaluation

Title = {{Effects of Intrabony Length and Cortical Bone Density on the Primary
   Stability of Orthodontic Miniscrews}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Miniscrews have gained recent popularity as temporary anchorage devices
   in orthodontic treatments, where failure due to sinus perforations or
   damage to the neighboring roots have increased. Issues regarding
   miniscrews in insufficient interradicular space must also be resolved.
   This study aimed to evaluate the primary stability of miniscrews shorter
   than 6 mm and their feasibility in artificial bone with densities of 30,
   40, and 50 pounds per cubic foot (pcf). The primary stability was
   evaluated by adjusting the intrabony miniscrew length, based on several
   physical properties: maximum insertion torque (MIT), maximum removal
   torque (MRT), removal angular momentum (RAM), horizontal resistance, and
   micromotion. The MIT and micromotion results demonstrated that the
   intrabony length of a miniscrew significantly affected its stability in
   low-density cortical bone, unlike cases with a higher cortical bone
   density (p < 0.05). The horizontal resistance, MRT, and RAM were
   affected by the intrabony length, regardless of the bone density (p <
   0.05). Thus, the primary stability of miniscrews was affected by both
   the cortical bone density and intrabony length. The effect of the
   intrabony length was more significant in low-density cortical bone,
   where the implantation depth increased as more energy was required to
   remove the miniscrew. This facilitated higher resistance and a lower
   risk of falling out.}},

Title = {{Interpretable Cross-Subject EEG-Based Emotion Recognition Using
   Channel-Wise Features(dagger)}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition is receiving
   significant attention in research on brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and
   health care. To recognize cross-subject emotion from EEG data
   accurately, a technique capable of finding an effective representation
   robust to the subject-specific variability associated with EEG data
   collection processes is necessary. In this paper, a new method to
   predict cross-subject emotion using time-series analysis and spatial
   correlation is proposed. To represent the spatial connectivity between
   brain regions, a channel-wise feature is proposed, which can effectively
   handle the correlation between all channels. The channel-wise feature is
   defined by a symmetric matrix, the elements of which are calculated by
   the Pearson correlation coefficient between two-pair channels capable of
   complementarily handling subject-specific variability. The channel-wise
   features are then fed to two-layer stacked long short-term memory
   (LSTM), which can extract temporal features and learn an emotional
   model. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets, the
   Dataset for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP) and the
   SJTU (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED),
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the combined use of channel-wise
   features and LSTM. Experimental results achieve state-of-the-art
   classification rates of 98.93\% and 99.10\% during the two-class
   classification of valence and arousal in DEAP, respectively, with an
   accuracy of 99.63\% during three-class classification in SEED.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel approach to learning cloth deformation as a function
   of body pose, recasting the graph-like triangle mesh data structure into
   image-based data in order to leverage popular and well-developed
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a two-dimensional Euclidean
   domain. Then, a three-dimensional animation of clothing is equivalent to
   a sequence of two-dimensional RGB images driven/choreographed by time
   dependent joint angles. In order to reduce nonlinearity demands on the
   neural network, we utilize procedural skinning of the body surface to
   capture much of the rotation/deformation so that the RGB images only
   contain textures of displacement offsets from skin to clothing. Notably,
   we illustrate that our approach does not require accurate unclothed body
   shapes or robust skinning techniques. Additionally, we discuss how
   standard image based techniques such as image partitioning for higher
   resolution can readily be incorporated into our framework.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen grain was explored as a new carrier for enzyme immobilization.
   After being modified with boric acid-functionalized titania, the pollen
   grain was able to covalently immobilize glycosylated enzymes by boronate
   affinity interaction under very mild experimental conditions (e.g., pH
   7.0, ambient temperature and free of organic solvent). The glucose
   oxidase and horse radish peroxidase-immobilized pollen grain became a
   bienzyme system. The pollen grain also worked as an indicator of the
   cascade reaction by changing its color. A rapid, simple and
   cost-effective approach for the visual detection of glucose was then
   developed. When the glucose concentration exceeded 0.5 mM, the color
   change was observable by the naked eye. The assay of glucose in body
   fluid samples exhibited its great potential for practical application.}},

Abstract = {{The nanostructure and chloride binding capacity evolution of C-A-S-H gel
   exposed to aggressive solutions were investigated, utilizing Si-29 NMR,
   Al-27 NMR, SEM-EDS, and XRD techniques. The experimental results show
   that while Cl- ions show a smaller effect on the microstructure of
   C-A-S-H sample, and SO42- ions can react with C-A-S-H, resulting in
   decreasing Ca/Si and Al{[}4]/Si for the C-A-S-H gel (i e,
   decalcification and dealuminization). The presence of Mg2+ ions can
   aggravate the decalcifying and dealuminizing effects of SO42- ions on
   the C-A-S-H. With decreasing Ca/Si ratio and aluminum substitution for
   the original C-A-S-H gel, the depolymerization degree of silicate
   tetrahedra increases and the calcium aluminosilicate skeleton
   strengthens. C-A-S-H gel with lower Ca/Si ratio and higher Al{[}4]/Si
   ratio shows gentler nanostructure evolution under chemical attack, i e,
   improving thermodynamic stability under chemical attack. Furthermore,
   the chloride binding capacity of C-A-S-H gel is decreased after the
   sulfate attack. Aluminum substitution can also help C-A-S-H gel resist
   the degraded chloride binding capacity induced by sulfate attack.}},

Title = {{Comparison of actual and simulated tumoricidal effects induced by
   photodynamic therapy}},
Journal = {{PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Numerous studies employ mathematical methods, such as Monte
   Carlo simulation, to predict the tumor killing effects of photodynamic
   therapy (PDT) by simulating optical propagation, photosensitizer
   distribution, and oxygen distribution. Whether these models faithfully
   reflect tumor killing is unknown, and model validation using tumor cross
   sections in these studies is usually insufficient to answer this
   question. To fill this gap in our knowledge, we employed a mouse model
   of breast cancer to determine the spatiotemporal effects of PDT using
   direct histopathological and biochemical analyses of whole tumors.
   Methods: We prepared approximately 700 5-mu m-thick serial sections of
   breast tumors of syngeneic mice treated with PDT employing the
   photosensitizer photocarcinorin (PsD-007, a second-generation
   photosensitizer developed in China). Three adjoining sections were
   subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining to assess necrosis, the
   TUNEL assay to evaluate apoptosis, and CD31 staining to detect
   angiogenesis, respectively. We then generated a three-dimensional (3D)
   reconstruction of the tumor to evaluate these processes. We
   simultaneously used the Monte Carlo method to develop a model of light
   distribution throughout the tumor to evaluate the actual and simulated
   tumor killing effects induced by PDT.
   Results: Tumor necrosis decreased exponentially as a function of
   distance from the source of illumination, while the distributions of
   apoptosis and neovascularization were independent of light distribution.
   Most apoptosis occurred in the lower layers (3000-4000 mu m) of the
   tumor where the light intensity was too low to excite the
   photosensitizer. Neovascularization occurred at depths ranging from 2500
   to 3500 mu m. These analyses provided a 3D view of how a tumor is
   destroyed using PDT.
   Conclusions: Although the optical distribution model predicted tumor
   necrosis caused by PDT, it was ineffective in predicting the sites of
   apoptosis and vascular destruction. Mathematical modeling is limited in
   its capabilities required to gain a comprehensive understanding of the
   spatiotemporal events associated with PDT. The mouse model developed
   here will serve as a platform for detailed direct histopathological,
   biochemical, and molecular genetic analyses of the effects of PDT, which
   will facilitate the development of optimized treatment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Cisplatin, a commonly used anticancer drug, has been shown to induce
   acute kidney injury, which limits its clinical use in cancer treatment.
   Emerging evidence has suggested that AMP-activated protein kinase
   (AMPK), which functions as a cellular energy sensor, is activated by
   various cellular stresses that deplete cellular ATP. However, the
   potential role of AMPK in cisplatin-induced apoptosis of renal tubular
   epithelial cells has not been studied. In this study, we demonstrated
   that cisplatin activates AMPK (Thr(172) phosphorylation) in cultured
   renal tubular epithelial cells in a time-dependent manner, which was
   associated with p53 phosphorylation. Compound C, a selective AMPK
   inhibitor, suppressed cisplatin-induced AMPK activation, p53
   phosphorylation, Bax induction, and caspase 3 activation. Furthermore,
   silencing AMPK expression by siRNA attenuated cisplatin-induced p53
   phosphorylation, Bax induction, and caspase 3 activation. In a mouse
   model of cisplatin-induced kidney injury, compound C inhibited p53
   phosphorylation, Bax expression, caspase 3 activation, and apoptosis,
   protecting the kidney from injury and dysfunction. Taken together, these
   results suggest that the AMPK-p53-Bax signaling pathway plays a crucial
   role in cisplatin-induced tubular epithelial cell apoptosis.}},

Journal = {{RELIGIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Since the 1970s, religious charities in Chinese communities have
   gradually become public and rational, transforming from previously
   raising donations for the temples or disaster relief. Even in mainland
   China, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam all began to enter the secular
   society after the 1980s and gradually merged into local public life by
   providing public welfare. Little attention has been paid to Baha'i,
   which originated in Iran in the middle of the 19th century and has
   become one of the most rapidly expanding new religions in the world.
   Based upon the ethnography of a Baha'i group in Macau, we first
   introduce the development of Baha'i, its activities and its charity
   services. In considering this example, we engage with the following
   questions. As a new world religion, why would Baha'i carry out these
   charity events? How did it begin its charity activities in Macau? How do
   charity activities convey its religious philosophy and religious
   practice? How should we interpret these religious charity practices?
   This exploratory research on a religious group in Macau revealed that
   the modern religion derives publicity and rationalization from its
   strong driving force for secularization, that the believers are also
   increasingly emphasizing their social and cultural citizenship, and that
   the religious organization is also gradually transforming into a
   networked faith-based community.}},

Title = {{Imaging of enthesitis by an LED-based photoacoustic system}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Significance: One key pathological characteristic of seronegative
   spondyloarthropathy (SpA) is inflammation at the insertion of tendons
   and ligaments into the bone (enthesitis).
   Aim: We explore the potential of the emerging photoacoustic (PA) imaging
   in diagnosis of SpA and review its feasibility in detecting
   SpA-associated Achilles tendon enthesitis.
   Approach: A light-emitting diode (LED)-based PA and ultrasound combined
   system was employed. The PA images, both along the long and the short
   axes of each Achilles tendon insertion region, were acquired at 850-nm
   wavelength, which is sensitive in depicting increased blood volume
   (i.e., hyperemia). To assess the hyperemia indicating enthesis
   inflammation, two parameters were quantified in the imaged tendons,
   including the average intensity and the density of the color pixels in
   the pseudo-color PA images. Ten SpA patients, all of which met
   Assessment of SpA International Society (ASAS) criteria for SpA and were
   found to have Achilles enthesitis by clinical exam according to a
   board-certified rheumatologist, were included in the study.
   Results: The PA and Doppler ultrasound imaging of Achilles enthesitis
   resulting from these 10 SpA patients were compared to those from 10
   healthy volunteers, leading to statistically significant differences (p
   < 0.05) in the applied t-tests.
   Conclusions: This preliminary clinical study suggests that the LED-based
   PA imaging holds a promise for sensitive and objective assessment of SpA
   enthesitis in an outpatient setting of the rheumatology clinic. (C) The

Title = {{Valorization of food processing wastes and by-products for bioplastic
   production}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The global plastic production is reaching new altitudes every year.
   Growing production of petroleum-based plastics has incurred in disposal
   issues raising the concerns of plastic pollution and impact to the
   environment. These issues have encouraged innovation and research
   activities in the field of bioplastics, offering alternatives for
   conventional plastics. In recent years, global bioplastic production has
   also witnessed tremendous growth and expansion. Some of the main drivers
   of this growth are innovative biopolymers such as Polylactic acid (PLA)
   and Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). However, industrial expenses to
   produce bioplastics are much higher when compared to petroleum-derived
   plastics (e.g. industrial PHA production is estimated to be 5-10 times
   more expensive than petroleum-derived polymers). In this regard,
   globally many researchers have investigated for more environmentally
   friendly and cost-effective alternatives to produce plastics. One
   potential option to pursue would be to explore agri-food wastes and
   by-products for bioplastic production. This would not only reduce the
   volume of wastes and by-products, but also production costs incurred.
   This review paper provides an overview of bioplastics, including
   production methods and possibilities of industrial food waste
   valorization for bioplastic production.}},

Title = {{The role of negative carbon emissions in reaching the Paris climate
   targets: The impact of target formulation in integrated assessment
   models}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Global net-negative carbon emissions are prevalent in almost all
   emission pathways that meet the Paris temperature targets. In this
   paper, we generate and compare cost-effective emission pathways that
   satisfy two different types of climate targets. First, the common
   approach of a radiative forcing target that has to be met by the year
   2100 (RF2100), and, second, a temperature ceiling target that has to be
   met over the entire period, avoiding any overshoot. Across two
   integrated assessment models (IAMs), we found that the amount of
   net-negative emissions-when global net emissions fall below zero-depends
   to a large extent on how the target is represented, i.e. implemented in
   the model. With a temperature ceiling (no temperature overshoot),
   net-negative emissions are limited and primarily a consequence of
   trade-offs with non-CO2 emissions, whereas net-negative emissions are
   significant for the RF2100 target (temperature overshoot). The
   difference becomes more pronounced with more stringent climate targets.
   This has important implications: more stringent near-term emission
   reductions are needed when a temperature ceiling is implemented compared
   to when an RF2100 target is implemented. Further, in one IAM, for our
   base case assumptions, the cost-effective negative carbon emissions
   (i.e. gross anthropogenic removals) do not depend to any significant
   extent on how the constraint is implemented, only, largely, on the
   ultimate stringency of the constraint. Hence, for a given climate target
   stringency in 2100, the RF2100 target and the temperature ceiling may
   result in essentially the same amount of negative carbon emissions.
   Finally, it is important that IAM demonstrate results for diverse ways
   of implementing a climate target, since the implementation has
   implications for the level of near-term emissions and the perceived need
   for net-negative emissions (beyond 2050).}},

Abstract = {{Running pulsed-neutron logs in Malaysia has previously been plagued by
   results with high uncertainties, especially in brown fields with complex
   multistacked clastic reservoirs. Together with a wide range of
   porosities and permeabilities, the acquired logs quite often tended to
   yield inconclusive results. In addition, the relatively fresh aquifer
   water (where salinity varies from 5,000 to 40,000 ppm) makes reservoir
   fluid typing and distinguishing between oil and water even more
   challenging. As a result, the inconsistencies and uncertainties of the
   results tend to leave more questions than answers. Confidence in using
   pulsed-neutron logging, especially to validate fluid contacts for
   updating static and dynamic reservoir models, deteriorated within the
   various study teams. Due to this fact, the petrophysics team took the
   initiative to conduct a log off of three tools in one of their wells
   with the objective of making a detailed comparison of three
   pulsed-neutron tools in Malaysia's market today. The main criteria
   selected for comparisons were the consistency of the data,
   repeatability, and statistical variations.
   With recent advancements in pulsed-neutron (multidetector) tool
   technology, newer tools are being equipped with more efficient
   scintillation crystals, improving the repeatability of the measurements
   as well as the number of gamma ray (GR) count rates associated with the
   neutron interactions. In addition, the newer tools now have up to five
   detectors per tool, with the farthest detector supposedly being able to
   ``see{''} deeper into the formation, albeit at a lower resolution. With
   these new features in mind, the log off was conducted in a single well
   with a relatively simple completion string (single tubing, single
   casing), logged during shut-in conditions only, and the logs were
   acquired directly one after the other (back to back) to avoid bias to
   any particular tool.
   Both sigma and spectroscopy measurements were acquired to compare the
   capabilities of each tool. Due to the relatively freshwater salinity,
   the carbon-oxygen (C/O) ratio from the spectroscopy measurements is used
   to identify the remaining oil located in the reservoirs, while the sigma
   measurements determine the gas-oil or gas-water contact, if present.
   This paper will illustrate the steps taken by PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd
   (PCSB) to compare the raw data and interpreted results from the three
   pulsed-neutron tools. Consequently, a comparison from all the tools was
   made to the current understanding of the reservoir assessed. The points
   from these comparisons will then show which tools are favored over the
   rest.}},

Abstract = {{Figurines of women with obesity or who are pregnant ({''}Venus
   figurines{''}) from Upper Paleolithic Europe rank among the earliest art
   and endured from 38,000 to 14,000 BP (before present), one of the most
   arduous climatic periods in human history. We propose that the Venus
   representation relates to human adaptation to climate change. During
   this period, humans faced advancing glaciers and falling temperatures
   that led to nutritional stress, regional extinctions, and a reduction in
   the population. We analyzed Paleolithic figurines of women with obesity
   to test whether the more obese figurines are from sites during the
   height of the glacial advance and closer to the glacial fronts.
   Figurines are less obese as distance from the glaciers increases.
   Because survival required sufficient nutrition for child-bearing women,
   we hypothesize that the overnourished woman became an ideal symbol of
   survival and beauty during episodes of starvation and climate change in
   Paleolithic Europe.}},

Title = {{Effect of Time to Hand Therapy following Zone II Flexor Tendon Repair}},
Journal = {{PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   This population-based study aimed to define how time to hand therapy
   following isolated zone II flexor tendon repairs impacts complications
   and secondary procedures.
   Methods:
   Insurance claims from the Truven MarketScan Databases were used to
   evaluate outcomes after isolated zone II flexor tendon repairs between
   January 2009 and October 2015. Cohorts differing in time to hand therapy
   were compared to evaluate the impact on complications, reoperation, and
   number of therapy sessions. Secondary outcomes analyzed how the number
   of therapy sessions affected rates of reoperation.
   Results:
   Hand therapy was identified in 82\% of patients (N = 2867) following
   tendon reconstruction. Therapy initiation occurred within 1 week, 1-4
   weeks, and after 4 weeks in 56\%, 35\%, and 9\% of patients,
   respectively. Univariate analysis showed no difference in non-tendinous
   complications (27\%, 30\%, 29\%; P = 0.29) or tendon rupture rates
   (13\%, 13\%, 10\%; P = 0.42) within 90 days between cohorts.
   Multivariable analysis showed no difference in rates of tenolysis
   (6.3\%, 6\%, 4.4\%; P > 0.01). In the early initiation cohort, >23 hand
   therapy sessions were associated with the highest rates of tenolysis
   (19\%).
   Conclusions:
   Despite being a common fear of hand surgeons, early initiation of hand
   therapy was not associated with increased tendon rupture rates. Although
   delayed therapy is a concern for tendon scarring, it did not confer a
   higher risk of tenolysis. Complication rates do not appear to correlate
   with timing of hand therapy. Therefore, hand surgeons should promote
   early mobility following isolated flexor tendon injuries given the known
   functional outcome benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Curriculum models and training activities in medical education have been
   markedly enhanced to prepare physicians to address the health needs of
   diverse populations and to advance health equity. While different
   teaching and experiential learning activities in the public health and
   population health sciences have been implemented, there is no existing
   framework to measure the effectiveness of public and population health
   (PPH) education in medical education programs. In 2015, the Association
   of American Medical Colleges established the Expert Panel on Public and
   Population Health in Medical Education, which convened 20 U.S. medical
   faculty members whose goal was to develop an evaluation framework
   adapted from the New World Kirkpatrick Model. Institutional leaders can
   use this framework to assess the effectiveness of PPH curricula for
   learners, faculty, and community partners. It may also assist
   institutions with identifying opportunities to improve the integration
   of PPH content into medical education programs. In this article, the
   authors present outcomes metrics and practical curricular or
   institutional illustrations at each Kirkpatrick training evaluation
   level to assist institutions with the measurement of (1) reaction to the
   PPH education content, (2) learning accomplished, (3) application of
   knowledge and skills to practice, and (4) outcomes achieved as a result
   of PPH education and practice. A fifth level was added to measure the
   benefit of PPH curricula on the health system and population health. The
   framework may assist with developing a locally relevant evaluation to
   further integrate and support PPH education at U.S. medical schools and
   teaching hospitals.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing population of children with complex chronic
   conditions (CCCs) whose caregivers would benefit from palliative care
   (PC). However, little is known about caregivers' PC awareness. We aimed
   to describe PC awareness among caregivers of children with CCCs and
   identify factors associated with lack of PC awareness. We used the
   National Cancer Institute's national Health Information National Trends
   Survey 2018 data to determine the percentage of caregivers of ill
   children who have PC awareness. After matching, caregiver PC awareness
   was compared with that of (1) the general survey population, (2) other
   caregivers, and (3) caregivers not caring for children. We used
   multivariable regression to determine factors associated with lack of PC
   awareness. Of 131 caregivers, 60\% had ``never heard of{''} PC.
   Caregivers of children were no more likely to have heard of PC than the
   general survey population (P = .76), noncaregivers (P = .97), or
   caregivers of nonchildren (P = .13). Caregivers younger than 40 years
   and without a college degree were less likely to have PC awareness than
   their peers. Most caregivers of ill children have no PC awareness, with
   no more PC awareness than the general population. Nurses caring for
   children with CCCs can help educate families and other health care team
   members about PC.}},

Abstract = {{Arthur Hurst was a British First World War physician, best known for his
   films of shell shock, `War Neuroses'. He has often been portrayed an
   innovative pioneer of somewhat mysterious `suggestion' techniques for
   functional motor disorders but also as an ambitious clinician who
   exaggerated the effectiveness of his treatments and failed to address
   psychological factors. His use of suggestion, persuasion and
   re-education together with occupational therapy, for chronic or severe
   cases of shell shock stirred controversy at the time because of the
   dramatic nature of some of his treatment responses and lack of outcome
   data. In part, this was a turf war between neurologists and
   psychiatrists for a dominant therapeutic model. A re-evaluation of his
   publications and new research into soldiers treated at Seale Hayne in
   Devon show that Hurst pioneered multidisciplinary and empathetic
   treatments for functional motor disorders with good short-term outcomes,
   though insufficient data survives to assess longer term outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The National Science Foundation (NSF) reports that underrepresented
   minority students are just as interested as their White counterparts in
   majoring in science upon entering college.(1) However, the numbers of
   those receiving bachelors' degrees, attending graduate school, and
   earning doctorates remain lower than their White peers. To close this
   gap, the National Institutes of General Medical Science's (NIGMS)
   Initiative for Maximizing Student. Development (IMSD) at University of
   Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) supports the timely completion of
   PhD degrees by underrepresented students and their transition into
   successful biomedical research careers. Throughout UNTHSC's IMSD
   training program, we have designed interventions anchored by the central
   hypothesis that PhD attainment requires attentiveness to multiple
   factors (knowledge, psychosocial, financial and self-efficacy). An
   assessment of program outcomes demonstrates a progressive increase in
   trainee retention. Importantly, not-withstanding quantitative measurable
   outcomes, trainee and mentor evaluations express the value in addressing
   multiple (actors relevant to their success. Since 1996, our cumulative
   success of underrepresented minority students completing the doctorate
   increased from 64\% (1996) to 84\% completion (2018). Herein, we
   describe the UNTHSC IMSD training approach spanning its performance over
   two five-year cycles (2004-2008; 2009-2013) and new interventions
   created from lessons learned that influenced UNTHSC's newly awarded IMSD
   program (2017-2022).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: During motor execution (ME), mu power is diminished over the
   contralateral hemisphere and increased over the ipsilateral hemisphere,
   which has been associated with cortical activation of the contralateral
   motor areas and inhibition of the ipsilateral motor areas respectively.
   The influence of action observation (AO) and motor imagery (MI) on mu
   power is less clear, especially in children, and remains to be studied
   in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP). Methods: We determined
   mu power during ME, AO, and MI of 45 typically developing (TD) children
   and 15 children with uCP over both hemispheres, for each hand. Results:
   In TD children, over the left hemisphere mu power was lowered during ME
   when the right hand was used. In line, over the right hemisphere mu
   power was lowered when the left hand was addressed. In addition, during
   AO and MI increased mu power was observed when the right hand was
   addressed. In children with uCP, over the spared hemisphere mu power was
   diminished during ME when the less affected hand was used. However, over
   the lesioned hemisphere, no mu changes were observed. Conclusions: The
   results of TD children fit the activation/inhibition model of mu power.
   Significance: The results of children with uCP suggest that the lesioned
   hemisphere is unresponsive to the motor tasks. (C) 2020 International

Abstract = {{Declining soil moisture related to climate change can greatly affect

   Under both RCP scenarios, the ensemble medians of the projections show
   the emergence of the timing of SSD in Western Europe, Eastern United
   States, South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Australia, and Southern China
   over 40 years (<year 2060). In 2020, the Eastern United States,
   Australia, and Southern China already experienced SSD. These findings
   concur with those of previous observational studies on rapid droughts in
   the mid to late 2010s. On average, approximately 15\% and 29\% of the
   global land area will experience SSD under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5,
   respectively, by the end of the 21st century. A comparison of the timing
   of SSD in under RCP 8.5 with the timing of the global warming target
   (1.5 degrees C) shows that approximately 10\% of the global land area
   will experience SSD before the 1.5 degrees C warming target is achieved.
   However, this will double to approximately 23\% if the global warming
   level reaches 2 degrees C. The results of this study suggest that
   near-future predictions of the timing of SSD should be considered to
   mitigate its negative impacts.}},

Journal = {{CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Research suggests that household chaos is negatively associated with
   children's developmental outcomes; however, little is known about the
   potential detrimental effects that living in a chaotic home environment
   may have on adolescents' outcomes, particularly on their delinquent
   behaviors. This study aims to examine the association between household
   chaos and delinquency, test whether impulsivity explains this
   association, and explore whether school connectedness moderates the
   associations between household chaos, impulsivity, and delinquency.
   Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we
   employed PROCESS Macro in SPSS to test the mediation effect of
   impulsivity and the moderation effect of school connectedness. The
   results indicated that household chaos was positively associated with
   delinquency and that impulsivity mediated this association. Moderated
   mediation analyses also showed that the pathways between impulsivity and
   delinquency were moderated by school connectedness. These findings
   highlight the significance of household chaos for adolescents'
   impulsivity and delinquency, as well as the importance of school
   connectedness for ultimately preventing delinquency.}},

Abstract = {{A parameterization for the subgrid-scale cloud and precipitation
   fractions has been incorporated into the Predicted Particle Properties
   (P3) microphysics scheme for use in atmospheric models with relatively
   coarse horizontal resolution. The modified scheme was tested in a simple
   1D kinematic model and in the Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale
   (GEM) model using an operational global NWP configuration with a 25-km
   grid spacing. A series of 5-day forecast simulations was run using P3
   and the much simpler operational Sundqvist condensation scheme as a
   benchmark for comparison. The effects of using P3 in a global GEM
   configuration, with and without the modifications, were explored through
   statistical metrics of common forecast fields against upper-air and
   surface observations. Diagnostics of state variable tendencies from
   various physics parameterizations were examined to identify possible
   sources of errors resulting from the use of the modified scheme.
   Sensitivity tests were performed on the coupling between the deep
   convection parameterization scheme and the microphysics, specifically
   regarding assumptions in the physical properties of detrained ice. It
   was found that even without recalibration of the suite of moist physical
   parameterizations, substituting the Sundqvist condensation scheme with
   the modified P3 microphysics resulted in some significant improvements
   to the temperature and geopotential height bias throughout the
   troposphere and out to day 5, but with degradation to error standard
   deviation toward the end of the integrations, as well as an increase in
   the positive bias of precipitation quantities. The modified P3 scheme
   was thus shown to hold promise for potential use in coarse-resolution
   NWP systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has passed its first peak in Europe.
   Aim
   To describe the mortality in England and its association with SARS-CoV-2
   status and other demographic and risk factors.
   Design and setting
   Cross-sectional analyses of people with known SARS-CoV-2 status in the
   Oxford RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre {[}RSC] sentinel network.
   Method
   Pseudonytnised, coded clinical data were uploaded from volunteer general
   practice members of this nationally representative network (n= 4413734).
   All-cause mortality was compared with notional rates for 2019, using a
   relative survival mode( reporting relative hazard ratios (RHR). and 95\%
   confidence intervals (CI). A multivariable adjusted odds ratios (OR)
   analysis was conducted for those with known SARS-CoV-2 status (n= 56628.
   1.3\%) including multiple imputation and inverse probability analysis,
   and a complete cases sensitivity analysis.
   Results
   Mortality peaked in week 16. People living in households of >= 9 had a
   fivefold increase in relative mortality PHR = 5.1, 95\% CI = 4.87 to
   5.31, P<0.0001). The OHs of mortality were 8.9 (95\% CI = 6.7 to
   11.8.P<0.0001) and 9.7 (95\% CI = 7.1 to 13.2, P<0.0001) for
   virologically and clinically diagnosed cases respectively, using people
   with negative tests as reference. The adjusted mortality for the
   virotogicatly confirmed group was 18.1\%195\% CI = 17.6 to 18.71. Male
   sex, population density, black ethnicity (compared to whitel, and people
   with long-term conditions, including learning disability IOR =1.96, 95\%
   CI =1.22 to 3.18. P= 0.00561 had higher odds of mortality.
   Conclusion
   The first SARS-CoV-2 peak in England has been associated with excess
   mortality. Planning for subsequent peaks needs to better manage risk in
   males, those of black ethnicity, older people, people with learning
   disabilities, and people who live in multi-occupancy dwellings.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aims to find out the ideas that 4th and 6th grade
   Primary Education students in Madrid and Buenos Aires have about school
   participation. 153 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted
   with girls and boys aged 9 and 11 from both countries, in which they
   were asked to resolve a specific dilemma regarding democratic
   participation in schools. The results show that girls and boys in 4th
   and 6th grade of primary school in both cities mostly maintain a
   conception of participation from an approach that emphasizes the role of
   personal autonomy in democratic decision-making, in contrast to a focus
   more centered on authority and merit. There are also gender differences
   in the representations of school participation in both samples, as well
   as differences by city in these representations. We conclude by
   highlighting the importance of investigating how different children's
   representations develop and coordinate when they interpret and evaluate
   social reality based on their own experiences with particular cultural
   practices and educational contexts, in order to account for
   participation, decision-making and social justice.}},

Title = {{Changes in motile benthic faunal community structure following
   large-scale oyster reef restoration in a subtropical estuary}},
Journal = {{FOOD WEBS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Restored oyster reefs support diverse communities of motile benthic
   organisms (small fishes and macroinvertebrates). These communities
   represent a critical component of estuarine food webs and frequently
   include juveniles of ecologically and economically important species
   that utilize oyster reefs as nurseries. Oyster-related metrics are
   commonly used to quantify restoration success, yet it is also important
   to examine communities of oyster-associated organisms when attempting to
   identify ecological convergence between natural and restored oyster
   reefs. Here, we compare the community composition of motile benthic
   organisms over time at one restored and three natural oyster
   (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in the Loxahatchee River estuary (Florida,
   USA) as one means of assessing restoration success. We also examine the
   effects of vertical relief on motile benthic organisms following
   restoration. The community of motile benthic organisms at the 1.93-ha
   restoration reef gradually began to resemble natural communities in the
   months following reef construction. Within similar to 22 months, biomass
   and community composition were similar between natural and restored
   habitats. At that point, the mean biomass of motile benthic organisms at
   the restoration site had reached 83.6 g/m(2) (versus 89.8 g/m(2) at
   nearby natural reefs), and the restored reef supported >1600 kg of
   small, motile, oyster-associated organisms. Biomass values increased
   more rapidly in high-relief sections of the restored reef (30 cm vs. 15
   cm reef height), particularly during the first year following
   restoration. High-relief areas were also characterized by increased
   oyster densities, greater oyster-generated rugosity. and decreased
   sedimentation. Our findings suggest that small differences in reef
   design can have important implications for restoration success as well
   as food web structure and dynamics via shifts in community composition.

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   In order to clarify whether an early development of brain metastases
   from non-small cell lung cancer represents a poor prognostic factor for
   further survival we analyzed 377 patients with brain metastases, treated
   by radiosurgery or surgery at two German institutions. Our results show
   that an early appearance of brain metastasis does not influence further
   survival in a comprehensive treatment setting.
   Objective: We attempted to analyze whether early presentation with brain
   metastases (BM) represents a poor prognostic factor in patients with
   non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which should guide the treatment
   team towards less intensified therapy. Patients and methods: In a
   retrospective bi-centric analysis, we identified patients receiving
   surgical treatment for NSCLC BM. We collected demographic-, tumor-, and
   treatment-related parameters and analyzed their influence on further
   survival. Results: We included 377 patients. Development of BM was
   precocious in 99 (26.3\%), synchronous in 152 (40.3\%), and metachronous
   in 126 (33.4\%) patients. The groups were comparable in terms of age (p
   = 0.76) and number of metastases (p = 0.11), and histology (p = 0.1);
   however, mutational status significantly differed (p = 0.002). The
   precocious group showed the worst clinical status as assessed by
   Karnofsky performance score (KPS) upon presentation (p < 0.0001).
   Resection followed by postoperative radiotherapy was the predominant
   treatment modality for precocious BM, while in syn- and metachronous BM
   surgical and radio-surgical treatment was balanced. Overall survival
   (OS) did not differ between the groups (p = 0.76). A good postoperative
   clinical status (KPS >= 70) and the application of any kind of adjuvant
   systemic therapy were independent predictive factors for OS. Conclusion:
   Early BM presentation was not associated with worse OS in NSCLC BM
   patients.}},

   Tree and Shrub Species: A New Approach to Quantify Climate-Growth
   Relationships}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The quantification of climate-growth relationships is a fundamental step
   in tree-ring sciences. This allows the assessment of functional
   responses to climate warming, particularly in biodiversity and
   climate-change hotspots including the Mediterranean Basin. In this
   region, broadleaf tree and shrub species of pre-Mediterranean,
   subtropical origin, have to withstand increased aridification trends.
   However, they have not been widely studied to assess their long-term
   growth responses to climate and drought. Since these species evolved
   under less seasonal and wetter conditions than strictly Mediterranean
   species, we hypothesized that their growth would mainly respond to
   higher precipitation and water availability from spring to early summer.
   Here, we quantified climate-growth relationships in five of these
   broadleaf species showing different leaf phenology and wood type
   (Pistacia terebinthus L., Pistacia lentiscus L., Arbutus unedo L.,
   Celtis australis L., and Laurus nobilis L.) by using dendrochronology.
   We calculated Pearson correlations between crossdated, indexed, mean
   ring width series of each species (chronologies) and monthly climate
   variables (mean temperature, total precipitation). We also calculated
   correlations between the species' chronologies and a drought index on
   7-day scales. Lastly, we compared the correlation analyses with
   ``climwin{''} analyses based on an information-theoretic approach and
   subjected to cross-validation and randomization tests. As expected, the
   growth of all species was enhanced in response to wet and cool
   conditions during spring and early summer. In some species (P.
   lentiscus, A. unedo, C. australis,) high prior-winter precipitation also
   enhanced growth. Growth of most species strongly responded to 9-month
   droughts and the correlations peaked from May to July, except in L.
   nobilis which showed moderate responses. The ``climwin{''} analyses
   refined the correlation analyses by (i) showing the higher explanatory
   power of precipitation (30\%) vs. temperature (7\%) models, (ii)
   selecting the most influential climate windows with June as the median
   month, and (iii) providing significant support to the precipitation
   model in the case of P. terebinthus confirming that the radial growth of
   this species is a robust proxy of hydroclimate variability. We argue
   that ``climwin{''} and similar frameworks based on information-theoretic
   approaches should be applied by dendroecologists to critically assess
   and quantify climate-growth relationships in woody plants with
   dendrochronological potential.}},

Title = {{Introducing a new approach for wind energy potential assessment under
   climate change at the wind turbine scale}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{225}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{An important aspect of planning the future expansion of wind energy is
   the consideration of changes in available wind resources due to climate
   change. In previous studies simulations of the future behavior of wind
   resources were derived from regional climate models at coarse spatial
   resolutions not suitable for wind energy potential assessment at the
   wind turbine scale. Thus, this study investigates the hypothesis that
   changes in future wind resources initiated by climate change will
   influence important aspects of small-scale wind resource assessment. A
   new approach is introduced that can be used to quantify the (1) spatial
   wind resource availability, (2) temporal wind resource availability, and
   (3) geographical complementarity under climate change at the wind
   turbine scale. The assessment of the future spatiotemporal variations in
   wind resources is based on an ensemble of near-surface (10 m) wind speed
   time series at a daily resolution for the period 1981-2099 from 35
   different regional climate models. Using the highly resolved (horizontal
   resolution: 200 m x 200 m) Wind Speed-Wind Shear model, the near-surface
   wind speed time series were bias-corrected and extrapolated to a wind
   turbine hub height of 140 m at the sites of the current wind turbines in
   Germany. Bias correction was carried out by matching the quantile
   distributions from the regional climate models and the Wind Speed-Wind
   Shear model. Afterward, a power curve of a modern 3.45 MW wind turbine
   was applied to calculate daily capacity factors. The results indicate
   small long-term changes in the wind resource availability under the
   representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5. It was found, that
   the influence of the interannual variability of the German wind resource
   exceeds the influence of climate change on the wind resource. The newly
   developed approach goes beyond previous wind resource assessments under
   climate change because it offers the opportunity for the spatially
   explicit investigation of different aspects of wind resource assessment
   which allows to develop more sophisticated wind energy expansion plans.
   Although the results are valid only for the study area, the proposed
   methodology is portable to any other region around the world.}},

Abstract = {{A fluorine content analysis method for krill oils, which is a
   representative oil formulation in foods, was developed in compliance
   with the Korea Food and Drug Ministry's ``Guidelines for Validation of
   Testing Methods Related to Food{''}. Using this method for krill oils,
   the presence of impurities was evaluated via combustion-ion
   chromatography (C-IC). A review of published technical data on fluorine
   in krill oils showed that while the traditional wet potentiometric
   method was typically used, it was not reliable. Moreover, there was no
   food testing/analysis laboratory in Korea to perform a fluorine test
   analysis on such an oil matrix. Therefore, we identified halogen
   (fluorine) tests, developed to national and international standards, and
   developed a test method suitable for krill oils by selecting a C-IC
   method that is sufficiently applicable to the oil matrix. Based on the
   characteristics of the oil matrix, the optimal test method was
   established through various experiments by reviewing the concerns
   related to loss and interference in the preparation and introduction of
   samples. The fluorine content test was carried out on 11 krill oil
   products that were purchased online. Most products (with the exception
   of only one) were found to contain less than the reporting limit
   obtained by the test method. Furthermore, after additional testing, a
   high fluorine content of approximately 2,000 similar to 3,000 mg/kg was
   detected on the krill surface, although the concentration varied
   depending on the area of the krill. A comparison with samples from two
   ISO/IEC 17025 testing laboratories confirmed that there was no
   significant difference in the statistical analysis results obtained by
   ANOVA among the three laboratories. A testing guide for fluorine content
   analysis was completed.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of CD68(+) macrophages and
   inflammatory/signaling proteins in the decidua of singleton pregnancies
   with late-onset pre-eclampsia.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective
   case-control study. Decidual tissue samples were obtained from twenty
   healthy pregnant women as a control group and twenty pregnant women with
   late-onset pre-eclampsia showing severe symptoms as the study group. We
   examined the abundance of CD68(+) macrophages in both groups using flow
   cytometry. Protein and mRNA expression levels of inflammatory/signaling
   proteins, including inducible nitric oxide synthase. nuclear
   factor-kappa B inhibitor alpha, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphorylated
   c-Jun N-terminal kinase, in the decidua of both groups were measured
   using Western blotting and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain
   Reaction. respectively. Student's t-tests were performed for statistical
   analysis.
   RESULTS: The numbers of CD68(+) macrophages were similar in the study
   and control groups (p=0.47). However, the levels of inducible nitric
   oxide synthase, nuclear factor-kappa B, cyclooxygenase-2, and
   phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase were significantly increased in
   the study group. Therefore. pro-inflammatory mediators and signaling
   proteins in the decidua during pre-eclampsia may be related to the
   pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pre-eclampsia-induced alterations in the expression of
   inflammatory/signaling proteins in the decidua during singleton
   pregnancies may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of
   pre-eclampsia.}},

Abstract = {{A small leak occurring on the surface of a fuel rod due to damage
   exposes UO2 to a steam atmosphere. During this time, fission gas trapped
   inside the fuel rod leaks out, and the gas leakage can be increased due
   to UO2 oxidation. Numerous studies have focused on the steam oxidation
   and its thermodynamic calculation in UO2. However, the thermodynamic
   calculation of the UO2 oxidation in a pressurized water reactor (PWR)
   environment has not been studied extensively. Moreover, the kinetics of
   the oxidation of UO2 pellet also has not been investigated. Therefore,
   in this study, the thermodynamics of UO2 oxidation under steam injection
   due to a damaged fuel rod in a PWR environment is studied. In addition,
   the diminishing radius of the UO2 pellet with time in the PWR
   environment was calculated through an experiment simulating the initial
   time of steam injection at the puncture. (C) 2020 Korean Nuclear

Abstract = {{Recent advances in artificial materials, namely metamaterials and
   metasurfaces, have aided in generating new technologies for ultrasonic
   applications. However, majority of the previous research studies have
   focused on elastic waves and acoustic waves in air, whereas underwater
   acoustics (one of the most important topics in ultrasonic applications)
   has been rarely studied. In particular, very limited research has been
   conducted on underwater metasurfaces that can tailor the flow of
   acoustic waves with very thin structures. In this study, as a basic
   approach to develop underwater metasurface technologies, we present a
   novel underwater metasurface that can tailor the flow of reflected waves
   towards any desired direction, along with the corresponding numerical
   and experimental corroborations. We found that the solid-fluid
   interaction can become very active, even though such interaction has
   almost been overlooked in previous studies. Furthermore, we designed an
   underwater metasurface that can suppress undesired solid-fluid
   interactions, and the corresponding numerical and experimental
   validations were accordingly conducted. We believe that this study can
   provide a cogent premise for developing various underwater metasurfaces.}},

Title = {{Assessment of the transit ridership prediction errors using AVL/APC data}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2731-2755}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The disparity between actual and forecasted transit ridership has been
   an important area of study and a concern for researchers for several
   decades. In order to decrease the discrepancy caused by model property
   errors, a number of studies focus on better representation of
   difficult-to-measure cost functions and incorporation of behavioral
   variables in mode choice models. In spite of the improvement, some gaps
   still remain in practical applications, particularly for large-scale
   regional travel forecasting models which are zone-based and aggregated.
   With automated data collection systems including Automatic Vehicle
   Location/Automatic Passenger Count (AVL/APC), modellers have great
   potential to use these technologies as new or complementary data sources
   to reliably estimate system performances and observed transit ridership.
   In particular, an opportunity exists to explore model prediction errors
   at a more disaggregate spatial scale. In this paper, using AVL/APC data,
   a method to effectively identify and evaluate the source of transit
   ridership prediction errors is proposed. Multinomial regression models
   developed in this research produce equations for mode choice prediction
   errors as a function of: measurable but omitted market segmentation
   variables in current mode choice utility functions; and newly
   quantifiable attributes with new data sources or techniques including
   quality of service variables. Further, the proposed composite index can
   systematically evaluate and prioritize the major source of prediction
   errors by quantifying total magnitudes of prediction error and a
   possible error component. The outcomes of the research can serve as
   foundation towards more reliable and accurate mode choice models and
   ultimately enhanced transit travel forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{This prospective study investigates age-dependent changes in
   anthropometric data and body composition over a period of two decades in
   consideration of physical activity and diet in community-dwelling
   subjects >= 60 years. Overall, 401 subjects with median follow-up time
   of 12 years were examined. Fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) were
   analyzed using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Physical activity was
   assessed via a self-administered questionnaire. Dietary intake was
   examined by 3-day dietary records. Linear mixed-effects models were used
   to analyze the influence of age, sex, physical activity and
   energy/protein intake on anthropometric data and body composition by
   considering year of entry, use of diuretics and diagnosis of selected
   diseases. At baseline, median values for daily energy and protein
   intakes were 8.5 megajoule and 81 g and physical activity index was 1.7.
   After adjusting for covariates, advancing age was associated with
   parabolic changes indicating overall changes from age 60 to 90 years in
   women and men in body mass: -4.7 kg, -5.0 kg; body mass index: +0.04
   kg/m(2), -0.33 kg/m(2); absolute FFM: -2.8 kg, -3.5 kg; absolute FM:
   -1.8 kg, -1.2 kg and waist circumference: +16 cm, +12 cm, respectively.
   No age-dependent changes were found for upper arm circumference and
   relative (\%) FFM. Dietary and lifestyle factors were not associated
   with changes in anthropometric or body composition parameters. In
   summary, the results indicate non-linear age-dependent changes in
   anthropometric data and body composition, which are largely unaffected
   by the degree of habitual physical activity and dietary protein intake
   in well-nourished community-dwelling subjects.}},

   Towards understanding the function of the temporoparietal junction}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{247-265}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and related areas are activated when
   a target stimulus appears at unexpected locations in Posner's
   spatial-cueing paradigm, and also when deviant stimuli are presented
   within a series of standard events in oddball paradigms. This type of
   activation corresponds to the ventral attention network (VAN), for
   regions defined on the basis of the spatial task. However, involvement
   of the VAN in object-based updating of attention has rarely been
   examined. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to investigate brain responses to (i) invalid targets after
   category-cueing and (ii) neutrally cued targets deviating in category
   from the background series of pictures. Bilateral TPJ activation was
   observed in response to invalidly cued targets, as compared to neutrally
   cued targets. Reference to the main large-scale brain networks showed
   that peaks of this activation located in the angular gyrus and inferior
   parietal lobule belonged to the default mode (DMN) and fronto-parietal
   networks (FPN), respectively. We found that VAN regions were involved
   only for simple detection activity. We conclude that spatial and non
   spatial reorienting of attention rely on different network
   underpinnings. Our data suggest that DMN and FPN activity may support
   the ability to disengage from contextually irrelevant information. (C)

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggested that, during mastication, magnitude and
   location of mechanical load in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) might
   depend on chewing side and bolus size. Aim of this study was to
   dynamically measure the TMJ space while chewing on standardized boluses
   to assess the relationship among minimum intra-articular distances
   (MID), their location on the condylar surface, bolus size, and chewing
   side. Mandibular movements of 12 participants (6f, 24 +/- 1y.o.; 6 m, 28
   +/- 6y.o.) were tracked optoelectronically while chewing unilaterally on
   rubber boluses of 15 x 15 x 5, 15 x 15 x 10, and 15 x 15 x 15 mm(3)
   size. MID and their location along the main condylar axis were
   determined with dynamic stereometry. MID were normalized on the
   intra-articular distance in centric occlusion. Repeated measures ANOVA
   (alpha = 0.05) showed that MID were smaller on the balancing (0.74 +/-
   0.19) than on the working condyle (0.89 +/- 0.16) independently of bolus
   size ( p < 0.0 0 01). MIDs did not differ between 5 and 10 mm bolus
   thicknesses (0.80 +/- 0.17) but increased for 15 mm (0.85 +/- 0.22, p =
   0.024) and were located mostly laterally, close to the condylar center.
   This study confirmed higher reduction of TMJ space on the balancing than
   on the working condyle during mastication. Intra-articular distances
   increased significantly for the greatest bolus thickness. Loaded areas
   were located laterally, for both working and balancing joint. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{The distal lung is a honeycomb-like collection of delicate gas exchange
   sacs called alveoli lined by two interspersed epithelial cell types: the
   cuboidal, surfactant-producing alveolar type II (AT2) and the flat,
   gas-exchanging alveolar type I (AT1) cell. During aging, a subset of AT2
   cells expressing the canonical Wnt target gene, Axin2, function as stem
   cells, renewing themselves while generating new AT1 and AT2 cells. Wnt
   activity endows AT2 cells with proliferative competency, enabling them
   to respond to activating cues, and simultaneously blocks AT2 to AT1 cell
   transdifferentiation. Acute alveolar injury rapidly expands the AT2 stem
   cell pool by transiently inducing Wnt signaling activity in ``bulk{''}
   AT2 cells, facilitating rapid epithelial repair. AT2 cell ``stemness{''}
   is thus tightly regulated by access to Wnts, supplied by a specialized
   single-cell fibroblast niche during maintenance and by AT2 cells
   themselves during injury repair. Two non-AT2 ``reserve{''} cell
   populations residing in the distal airways also contribute to alveolar
   repair, but only after widespread epithelial injury, when they rapidly
   proliferate, migrate, and differentiate into airway and alveolar
   lineages. Here, we review alveolar renewal and repair with a focus on
   the niches, rather than the stem cells, highlighting what is known about
   the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which they control stem cell
   activity in vivo.}},

Title = {{Dimensions of changing perception towards wildlife conservation in East

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Perception towards the wildlife conservation of locals determines the
   future of conservation programs, hence we assessed the perception of
   forest communities in East Siang district towards wildlife conservation
   in their surroundings. We collected questionnaire data from 1079
   respondents of East Siang District, Arunachal Pradesh during Nov 2018 to
   Feb 2019. The influence of different parameters including
   socio-demographic, socio-economic and human-wildlife interactions on
   local communities opinions concerning wildlife conservation were
   examined. The respondents provided wide and diversified responses about
   the significance of wildlife for different purposes such as food
   consumption (hunting) to mixed concerns (aesthetic, moral and future
   values) and ecological balance. The responses were recorded and tested
   independent variables, namely age, gender, household size, education,
   house type, crop damages, livestock attacks, human attacks, village,
   circles and occupation. The ANCOVA test revealed that villages (p =
   0.000), circles (p = 0.001), education (p = 0.012), human attacks (p =
   0.003) and gender (p = 0.033) were significantly associated with their
   opinions. Whereas the socio-economic status of locals also had a role in
   shaping perceptions about the wildlife conservation. The respondents
   belonging to the lower socio-economic classes have the negative attitude
   while upper classes have a positive attitude. Our research suggests that
   primary (adjusted standardized residual: asr = 2.3) and middle school
   (asr = 2.7) educated male respondents consider wildlife as food
   resources (asr = 3.7). However, the graduates believed that wildlife has
   a role in ecological balance (asr = 6.6). The increase in wildlife
   attacks on humans is unlikely to support conservation (asr = 4.5). It is
   suggested to enhance awareness creations, adoption of best practices to
   mitigate wildlife-human conflict and alternative livelihood for
   promoting wildlife conservation in the study landscape. (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {{Background: The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing worldwide at
   an alarming rate. BRAF(V600E) mutation is described to be associated
   with a worse prognostic of thyroid carcinomas, as well as extrathyroidal
   invasion and increased mortality.
   Objective: To our knowledge, there are no reported studies neither from
   Morocco nor from other Maghreb countries regarding the prevalence of
   BRAF(V600E) mutation in thyroid carcinomas. Here we aim to evaluate the
   frequency of BRAF(V600E) oncogene in Moroccan thyroid carcinomas.
   Methods: In this Single-Institution retrospective study realized in the
   Anatomic Pathology and Histology Service in the Military Hospital of
   Instruction Mohammed V `HMIMV' in Rabat, we report, using direct genomic
   sequencing, the assessment of BRAF(V600E) in 37 thyroid tumors.
   Results: We detected BRAF(V600E) mutation exclusively in Papillary
   Thyroid Carcinomas `PTC' with a prevalence of 28\% (8 PTC out 29 PTC).
   Like international trends, Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas `PTC' is more
   frequent than Follicular Thyroid Carcinomas `FTC' and Anaplastic Thyroid
   Carcinomas `ATC' (29 PTC, 7 FTC and 1 ATC).
   Conclusion: Our finding gives to the international community the first
   estimated incidence of this oncogene in Morocco showing that this
   prevalence falls within the range of international trends (30\% to 90\%)
   reported in distinct worldwide geographic regions.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we study the transmission of COVID-19 in the human
   population, notably between potential people and infected people of all
   age groups. Our objective is to reduce the number of infected people, in
   addition to increasing the number of individuals who recovered from the
   virus and are protected. We propose a mathematical model with control
   strategies using two variables of controls that represent respectively,
   the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 by subjecting them to
   quarantine within hospitals and special places and using masks to cover
   the sensitive body parts. Pontryagin's Maximum principle is used to
   characterize the optimal controls and the optimality system is solved by
   an iterative method. Finally, numerical simulations are presented with
   controls and without controls. Our results indicate that the
   implementation of the strategy that combines all the control variables
   adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO), produces excellent
   results similar to those achieved on the ground in Morocco. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{This paper presents a staggered scheme with second-order temporal
   accuracy for fluid-structure interaction problems involving
   ultra-lightweight rigid bodies. The staggered scheme is based on the
   Dirichlet-Neumann coupling and is non-intrusive. First, the spectral
   properties of the staggered scheme are studied and also compared against
   the monolithic scheme using a linear model problem. Later, the
   suitability and effectiveness of the staggered scheme for problems
   involving incompressible flows and lightweight rigid solids are
   illustrated by using the examples of galloping of a square cylinder and
   lock-in of a circular cylinder for mass-ratio values as low as 0.01.
   This is the first time in the literature flow-induced vibrations of
   rigid bodies with such low mass ratio values are successfully simulated
   using a staggered scheme. Two different fluid solvers are considered to
   illustrate the non-intrusive nature of the proposed scheme. Guidelines
   for choosing the relaxation parameter are also provided. With its
   iteration-free nature and with a single (relaxation) parameter, the
   proposed staggered scheme renders itself as an accurate and
   computationally efficient scheme for fluid-rigid body interaction
   problems, including those involving lightweight structures.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study is to present electrophysiologic
   characteristics and catheter ablation results of tachycardia-induced
   cardiomyopathy (TIC) in children with structurally normal heart.
   Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective review of all
   pediatric patients with TIC, who underwent an electrophysiology study
   and ablation procedure in our clinic between November 2013 and January
   2019.
   Results: A total of 26 patients, 24 patients with single tachyarrhythmia
   substrates and two patients each with two tachyarrhythmia substrates,
   resulting with a total of 28 tachyarrhythmia substrates, underwent
   ablation for TIC. The median age was 60 months (2-214 months). Final
   diagnoses were supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in 24 patients and
   ventricular tachycardia (VT) in two patients. The most common SVT
   mechanisms were focal atrial tachycardia (31\%), atrioventricular
   reentrant tachycardia (27\%), and permanent junctional reciprocating
   tachycardia (15\%). Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was performed in 15
   tachyarrhythmia substrates, and cryoablation was performed in 13
   tachyarrhythmia substrates, as the initial ablation method. Acute
   success in ablation was achieved in 24 out of 26 patients (92\%).
   Tachycardia recurrence was observed in two patients (8\%) on follow-up,
   who were treated successfully with repeated RFA later on. Overall
   success rates were 92\% (24 out of 26) in patients and 93\% (26 out of
   28) in substrates. On echocardiography controls, the median left
   ventricular recovery time was 3 months (1-24 months), and median
   reversible remodeling time was 6 months (3-36 months).
   Conclusion: TIC should be kept in mind during differential diagnosis of
   dilated cardiomyopathy. Pediatric TIC patients can be treated
   successfully and safely with RFA or cryoablation. With an early
   diagnosis of TIC and quick restoration of the normal sinus rythm, left
   ventricular recovery, and remodeling may be facilitated.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sulfur-doped carbon nanohorns (S-CNHs) were prepared by an easy one-pot
   solvothermal process and were employed as efficient electrocatalysts
   towards water splitting. Initially, oxidation of CNHs followed by
   thermal treatment with the Lawesson's reagent resulted in the formation
   of S-CNHs with the sulfur content determined as high as 3\%. The S-CNHs
   were thoroughly characterized by spectroscopic, thermal and electron
   microscopy imaging means and then electrocatalytically screened.
   Specifically, S-CNHs showed excellent activity and durability for both
   O-2 and H-2 evolution reactions, by showing low overpotential at 1.63
   and -0.2 V vs. RHE for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction,
   respectively. Additionally, S-CNHs showed significantly lower Tafel
   slope value and lower current resistance compared to oxidized and
   pristine CNHs for both electrocatalytic reactions. The outstanding
   electrocatalytic properties and high conductivity, along with the high
   S-doping level, render S-CNHs a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst
   for water splitting.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of components is a crucial
   task to enhance reliability, safety, productivity, and to reduce
   maintenance cost. In general, predicting the RUL of a component includes
   constructing a health indicator (HI) to infer the current condition of
   the component, and modelling the degradation process in order to
   estimate the future behavior. Although many signal processing and
   data-driven methods have been proposed to construct the HI, most of the
   existing methods are based on manual feature extraction techniques and
   require the prior knowledge of experts, or rely on a large amount of
   failure data. Therefore, in this study, a new data-driven method based
   on the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is presented to construct the HI.
   For this purpose, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) technique was
   used to convert the raw acquired vibrational signals into a
   two-dimensional image; then, the CAE model was trained by the healthy
   operation dataset. Finally, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) between the
   healthy and failure stages was measured as the HI. The proposed method
   was tested on a benchmark bearing dataset and compared with several
   other traditional HI construction models. Experimental results indicate
   that the constructed HI exhibited a monotonically increasing degradation
   trend and had good performance in terms of detecting incipient faults.}},

Abstract = {{Bioimaging: Spotting viral signatures with `superchiral' light A
   technique that uses twisted light fields to detect biomolecular
   structures could find application as a low-cost clinical tool for
   screening viruses. The protein coatings around many viruses, such as the
   turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), have complex polyhedral shapes that
   are difficult to resolve with conventional optical microscopes. Malcolm
   Kadodwala from the University of Glasgow and other colleagues in the
   United Kingdom now report that `superchiral' light - localized fields
   generated by metal nanostructures that spiral as they travel - are
   sensitive to the asymmetric polyhedral of TYMV. By spectroscopic
   measurements of particle rotations in superchiral light at different
   frequencies, the team identified specific asymmetric signals that
   correlated to virus alignment on gold photonic substrates. This approach
   was then used to determine TYMV levels in human blood serum spiked with
   the virus.
   Optical spectroscopy can be used to quickly characterise the structural
   properties of individual molecules. However, it cannot be applied to
   biological assemblies because light is generally blind to the spatial
   distribution of the component molecules. This insensitivity arises from
   the mismatch in length scales between the assemblies (a few tens of nm)
   and the wavelength of light required to excite chromophores (>= 150 nm).
   Consequently, with conventional spectroscopy, ordered assemblies, such
   as the icosahedral capsids of viruses, appear to be indistinguishable
   isotropic spherical objects. This limits potential routes to rapid
   high-throughput portable detection appropriate for point-of-care
   diagnostics. Here, we demonstrate that chiral electromagnetic (EM) near
   fields, which have both enhanced chiral asymmetry (referred to as
   superchirality) and subwavelength spatial localisation (similar to 10
   nm), can detect the icosahedral structure of virus capsids. Thus, they
   can detect both the presence and relative orientation of a bound virus
   capsid. To illustrate the potential uses of the exquisite structural
   sensitivity of subwavelength superchiral fields, we have used them to
   successfully detect virus particles in the complex milieu of blood
   serum.}},

   3.2.1.8) consists of 223 amino acids and 19 residues of a putative
   signal peptide in the N-terminal region. The amino-acid sequence of the
   mature protein has the greatest homology (84\%) with the sequence of the
   native catalytic N-terminal domain of Neocallimastix patriciarum
   endo-1,4-beta-xylanase. A synthetic nucleotide sequence encoding the
   mature XylP protein was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The purified
   recombinant enzyme was active with birch xylan and arabinoxylan as
   substrates. The optimal pH and temperature for enzyme activity were
   established as 5.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively, with the use of birch
   xylan. The specific activity of xylanase was 4700 U/mg protein, and K-M
   and V-max were equal to 0.51 mg/mL and 7395.3 mu mol/(min mg),
   respectively. The recombinant XylP protein showed moderate thermal and
   high pH stability, as well as resistance to digestive enzymes and
   protein xylanase inhibitors from cereals. It was also shown that Mg2+,
   Co2+ and Li+ ions have a positive effect on enzyme activity.}},

   356 to similar to 639 mg GAE.kg(-1) of olive oil. On the other hand, the
   fatty acid profiles of all studied oils were determined by GC-FID.
   Besides, olive oil obtained after 15 min of microwave olive past
   treatment followed by 10 or 15 min of ultrasound treatment showed that
   these oils had the highest value of Z-vaccenic (C18:1n-7) + Oleic
   (C18:1n-9) acids. These results encourage further developments for a
   combined continuous microwave and ultrasonic conditioning technology to
   fasten the olive oil extraction, to enhance total phenolic, chlorophyll
   as well as carotenoid contents and Fatty acid composition.}},

Abstract = {{Five years of semi-continuous displacement records from extensometers
   installed though a concrete mine shaft lining are analysed and
   interpreted. The data includes multiple episodes of contraction which
   have amplitudes up to 15 mm in individual extensometers. Detailed
   analysis of extensometer data suggests transient high stresses occur in
   the shaft lining. The amplitude, wavelength and frequency of the
   observed transient stresses gives a unique insight into the progressive
   redistribution of stress around underground infrastructure during
   mining. The displacement pattern can be modelled as comprising a
   circular, elliptiical and translational component. The elliptical
   flattening direction indicates a consistent north-south compression in
   most events analysed. The typical duration of the wave events is
   approximately 5 h indicating a slow creep-like mechanism. Although some
   events appear to occur on a 24 h cycle, comparison with the mining
   activity record did not show a close association with the stope
   excavation sequence.}},

   located between the 1b-10a pages. Between the 1b-7b pages of the work,
   the names of goods-tools, horse riding-harnesses, beverages, weapons,
   clothes, shoes, fabric, animals, food, fruits, organs, dwellings,
   plants-spices, paint, chemical substances are listed; afterwards,
   possessive suffixes of many of these names were given (except for the
   3rd person singular possessive suffixes). Between the pages 7b-8a,
   simple and compound tense verb inflection examples are given. In the
   pages between 8b- 10a of the work, the occupational titles of
   18th-century Istanbul (193 titles) are listed under the subheading ``Bdb

   oldest grammar book after Muyessiretu'l-Ulum (C.E. 1530), one of the
   Ottoman grammar books, is noteworthy as it includes the lexical and
   morphological features of 18th-century Turkish as well as it sheds light
   on the social and professional life of 18th century Istanbul and the
   daily life culture of the period. The purpose of this article is to
   introduce the work to the world of Turcology and to contribute to the

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:
   With health care practice consolidation, the increasing geographic scope
   of health care systems, and the advancement of mobile
   telecommunications, there is increasing interest in telemedicine-based
   health care consultations. Anesthesiology has had experience with
   telemedicine consultation for preoperative evaluation since 2004, but
   the majority of studies have been conducted in rural settings. There is
   a paucity of literature of use in metropolitan areas. In this article,
   we describe the implementation of a telemedicine-based anesthesia
   preoperative evaluation and report the program's patient satisfaction,
   clinical case cancellation rate outcomes, and cost savings in a large
   metropolitan area (Los Angeles, CA).
   METHODS:
   This is a descriptive study of a telemedicine-based preoperative
   anesthesia evaluation process in an academic medical center within a
   large metropolitan area. In a 2-year period, we evaluated 419 patients
   scheduled for surgery by telemedicine and 1785 patients who were
   evaluated in-person.
   RESULTS:
   Day-of-surgery case cancellations were 2.95\% and 3.23\% in the
   telemedicine and the in-person cohort, respectively. Telemedicine
   patients avoided a median round trip driving distance of 63 miles (Q1
   24; Q3 119) and a median time saved of 137 (Q1 95; Q3 195) and 130 (Q1
   91; Q3 237) minutes during morning and afternoon traffic conditions,
   respectively. Patients experienced time-based savings, particularly from
   traveling across a metropolitan area, which amounted to \$67 of direct
   and opportunity cost savings. From patient satisfaction surveys, 98\%
   (129 patients out of 131 completed surveys) of patients who were
   consulted via telemedicine were satisfied with their experience.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   This study demonstrates the implementation of a telemedicine-based
   preoperative anesthesia evaluation from an academic medical center in a
   metropolitan area with high patient satisfaction, cost savings, and
   without increase in day-of-procedure case cancellations.}},

Journal = {{CELL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Local cell contraction pulses play important roles in tissue and cell
   morphogenesis. Here, we improve a chemo-optogenetic approach and apply
   it to investigate the signal network that generates these pulses. We use
   these measurements to derive and parameterize a system of ordinary
   differential equations describing temporal signal network dynamics.
   Bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations predict a strong
   dependence of oscillatory system dynamics on the concentration of
   GEF-H1, an Lbc-type RhoGEF, which mediates the positive feedback
   amplification of Rho activity. This prediction is confirmed
   experimentally via optogenetic tuning of the effective GEF-H1
   concentration in individual living cells. Numerical simulations show
   that pulse amplitude is most sensitive to external inputs into the
   myosin component at low GEF-H1 concentrations and that the spatial pulse
   width is dependent on GEF-H1 diffusion. Our study offers a theoretical
   framework to explain the emergence of local cell contraction pulses and
   their modulation by biochemical and mechanical signals.}},

Abstract = {{Cord blood transplantation (CBT) is associated with low risk of leukemia
   relapse. Mechanisms underlying antileukemia benefit of CBT are not well
   understood, however a previous study strongly but indirectly implicated
   cells from the mother of the cord blood (CB) donor. A fetus acquires a
   small number of maternal cells referred to as maternal microchimerism
   (MMc) and MMc is sometimes detectable in CB. From a series of 95
   patients who underwent double or single CBT at our center, we obtained
   or generated HLA-genotyping of CB mothers in 68. We employed a technique
   of highly sensitive HLA-specific quantitative-PCR assays targeting
   polymorphisms unique to the CB mother to assay CB-MMc in patients
   post-CBT. After additional exclusion criteria, CB-MMc was evaluated at
   multiple timepoints in 36 patients (529 specimens). CB-MMc was present
   in seven (19.4\%) patients in bone marrow, peripheral blood, innate and
   adaptive immune cell subsets, and was detected up to 1-year post-CBT.
   Statistical trends to lower relapse, mortality, and treatment failure
   were observed for patients with vs. without CB-MMc post-CBT. Our study
   provides proof-of-concept that maternal cells of the CB graft can be
   tracked in recipients post-CBT, and underscore the importance of further
   investigating CB-MMc in sustained remission from leukemia following CBT.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To determine if there is an association between area-based visceral
   abdominal adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue
   (SAT), and abdominal circumference measured on computed tomography (CT)
   angiography before trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and
   post-TAVR acute kidney injury (AKI).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of 106 TAVR
   patients, SAT and VAT areas and abdominal circumference was measured on
   a single CT section at L4 vertebral level. Univariate comparisons
   between patients who did and did not develop AKI were undertaken for
   radiological measurements. Multivariable logistic regression was used to
   assess association between CT measurements and the development of
   post-TAVR AKI.
   RESULTS: Post-TAVR AKI occurred in 20 of 106 patients (19\%). In
   univariate comparisons, body mass index (BMI) did not differ
   significantly between patients who did and did not develop AKI (p=0.14);
   however, VAT+SAT (443.2 +/- 163.7 versus 351 +/- 168.7 cm(2); p=0.03),
   VAT (213.9 +/- 110.6 versus 153.9 +/- 96.1 cm(2); p=0.03), and outer
   abdominal circumference (100.2 +/- 14.4 cm versus 91.8 +/- 13.3 cm;
   p=0.02) were significantly higher in the patients who did not develop
   post-TAVR AKI. These three measures on pre-TAVR CT angiogram remained
   significantly associated with reduced post-TAVR AKI with a lower
   incidence of post-TAVR AKI after multivariable adjustment for pre-TAVR
   estimated glomerular filtration rate and patient height (p<0.05).
   CONCLUSION: This study found that increased abdominal obesity as
   assessed by measures on pre-TAVR CT angiogram is associated with a
   significantly lower incidence of AKI. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {{The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) analysis is conducted
   to estimate the site amplification effect and the thickness of the
   sedimentary layer beneath the measurement site. We investigated the
   effects of meteorological variations (wind and precipitation rate) and
   sensor burial depths on HVSR analysis. The HVSR results were unstable
   when seismographs were exposed on the ground. The HVSR results of
   ambient noise data measured under strong winds were also unstable. It is
   recommended to measure the ambient noise at wind speeds of <3 m s(-1).
   Stable HVSR results were obtained when seismographs were buried,
   regardless of the precipitation rates. The results of this study provide
   the best observations and optimal weather conditions required to acquire
   accurate and reliable HVSR results.}},

Journal = {{ORGANIC ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{A series of metal-quinolate (MQ(2)) materials (M = Be2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and
   Sr2+) were theoretically investigated to understand their electronic and
   charge transport properties as an application of electron injection
   layer (EIL) and additive material to electron transporting layer (ETL).
   It was found that the Be2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ are tetragonally coordinated
   to the quinolate ligands whereas the Sr2+ is planarly coordinated. The
   analyses of electronic properties indicated that the stable lowest
   unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of these materials
   relative to LiQ is expected to improve the electron injection from
   cathode and enhance the electron transport in ETL. In perspective of
   electrochemical reactivity, the chemical hardness values of MQ(2)
   materials showed that hole and electron carriers can be easily
   facilitated in order of BeQ(2) < MgQ(2) < CaQ(2) < SrQ(2). In
   particular, the results of charge carrier transport properties clearly
   showed that k(e) of SrQ(2) is 64\% higher than that of LiQ, which is an
   advantage for both EIL and ETL additive. Comprehensive analyses showed
   that SrQ2 is superior to LiQ as a replacement in perspective of electron
   injection and transport properties.}},

   a building block approach using a layering technique, and characterized
   by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared (IR) and impedance
   spectroscopies and magnetization measurements. During the
   crystallization process partial decomposition of the
   tris(oxalato)chromate(III) happened and 1D polymers 1 and 2 were formed.
   The antiferromagnetic interactions between the manganese(II) ions were
   mediated by oxalate ligands in the chain {[}Mn(bpy)(C2O4)](n) of 1, with
   intra-chain super-exchange interaction = (-3.134 +/- 0.004) K; magnetic
   interaction between neighbouring chains is negligible making this system
   closer than other known Mn-chains to the ideal 1D Heisenberg
   antiferromagnet. Compound 2 comprises a 1D coordination anion
   {[}Cu(bpy)Cr(C2O4)(3)](n)(n)(-) (Cr2-Cu4) with alternating
   {[}Cr(C2O4)(3)](3)(-) and {[}Cu(bpy)](2+) units mutually bridged through
   the oxalate group. Another chain (Cr1-Cu3) is similar, but involves a
   homodinuclear unit {[}Cu(bpy)(H2O)(mu-C2O4)Cu(bpy)(CH3OH)](2+) (Cu1-Cu2)
   coordinated as a pendant group to a terminal oxalate oxygen. Magnetic
   measurements showed that the Cu1-Cu2 cationic unit is a strongly coupled
   antiferromagnetic dimer, independent from the other magnetic ions within
   ferromagnetic chains Cr1-Cu3 and Cr2-Cu4. A 3D polymer
   \{{[}CaCr2Cu2(phen)(4)(C2O4)(6)]center dot 4CH(3)CN center dot
   2H(2)O\}(n) (3) comprising three different metal centers (Ca2+, Cr3+ and
   Cu2+) oxalate-bridged, contains Ca2+ atoms as nodes connected with four
   Cr3+ atoms through oxalate ligands. The network thus formed can be
   reduced to an underlying graph of diamondoid (dia) or (6(6)) topology.
   Magnetization of 3 shows the ferromagnetic oxalate-bridged dimers
   {[}(CuCrIII)-Cr-II], whose mutual interaction could possibly originate
   through the spin polarization of Ca2+ orbitals. Compounds 1 and 3
   exhibit lower electrical conductivity at room temperature (RT) in
   comparison to compound 2.}},

Abstract = {{This is the first of two narrative reviews on cognitive disorders in
   epilepsy (companion publication : Cognitive disorders in epilepsy II:
   Clinical targets, indications and selection of test instruments). Its
   focus is on clinical experience, real-world evidence, and clinical
   recommendations. Cognitive disorders are a common comorbidity in
   children and adults with epilepsy. These cognitive disturbances may
   preceed the onset of seizures and are multifactorial including
   contributions by pre-existing brain damage, seizures, interictal
   epileptic discharges, and treatments including medications and surgery.
   Comorbid cognitive impairments can have a negative impact on the quality
   of life in people with epilepsy. They are under-identified and
   frequently not treated. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as ADHD can
   also contribute to a worse cognitive performance and can benefit from
   pharmacotherapy with CNS stimulants. Likewise, mood disorders cause a
   subjective perception of poor memory and attention, which can be
   reversed with antidepressants of the SSRI family. This narrative review
   discusses these issues from a real-world clinical perspective in
   children and adults with newly diagnosed and chronic epilepsy. The need
   for further research to understand and treat these disorders is noted.}},

Abstract = {{Community-based home visiting programs are recommended vehicles for

   geographically dispersed throughout the United States. We implemented
   our protocol with 1 affiliate in each of 4 states. We assessed formative
   measures of the implementation from parent educators and site leaders
   and reviewed delivery process measures. Findings suggest that collecting
   data on child measurements through an existing home visiting program is
   1) feasible (91\% of estimated measurements achieved); 2) does not
   require much time (median, 0.5 hours spent per child); 3) is a positive
   experience for families (71\% of parent educators indicated that
   families enjoyed the experience); and 4) is fairly accurate (82\% of

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the performance of commodity cross-hedging of
   aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price exposures with crude oil and Brent oil
   futures for the Indian aviation industry. Models that were estimated
   using three alternative techniques of ordinary least squares (OLS),
   error correction models (ECMs), and autoregressive conditional
   heteroskedastic (ARCH) showed that Brent crude oil futures had the
   highest cross-hedging efficiency. Further, the variances of the profit
   and loss (P\&L) series and value at risk (VAR) associated with
   alternative hedging strategies including a composite hedge of crude oil
   and Brent oil futures - showed that although hedging is redundant for
   domestic operations, composite hedging for imported ATF prices could
   substantially lower the VAR compared to all other alternatives from
   imported and domestic operations. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {{This study appears to be the first attempt to use a novel
   microencapsulated apricot kernel powder (MAKP) to improve diabetes- and
   obesity-related parameters in the serum and liver tissue of normal-diet-
   and cafeteria-diet-fed rats. For this purpose, bitter apricot kernel
   powder (AKP) was microencapsulated within a maltodextrin matrix under
   optimized conditions, and the effects of treatment with MAKP at two
   doses (4 and 8 mg) on the parameters in normal-diet- and
   cafeteria-diet-fed rats were established. MAKP was characterized in
   terms of its molecular properties, revealing that AKP could be
   successfully encapsulated. MAKP was established to have clear effects of
   increasing (P < 0.01) the levels of the native thiol, total thiol, total
   antioxidant status, high-density lipoprotein and thioredoxin reductase
   parameters and of decreasing (P < 0.01) the levels of the total oxidant
   status, disulfide, indexes I and II, oxidative stress index, total
   cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, glucose, triglyceride, catalase,
   superoxide dismutase, tumor necrosis factor alpha and glutathione
   peroxidase parameters. However, these effects were dose independent and
   more prominent in the rats fed cafeteria diet. As a consequence, the use
   of MAKP significantly (P < 0.01) improved these parameters in the rats
   fed cafeteria diet, suggesting that the use of MAKP may contribute to
   the current efforts that are being exerted to treat diabetes and
   obesity-related disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Republic modernization, as a representation of a modern and national
   state system, forms the ideological basis of the reconstruction process
   determined by the internal components of Anatolia, social structure,
   topographic features and most importantly temporal components. In this
   context, these practices, which come into existence with different
   meanings and reveal their own modernity that they blend with their
   localities, have witnessed the history of modern architecture and
   planning while telling the evolution of the Republican ideology in
   peripheral cities following the center city with a limited content and
   in successive times. Today, it is possible to understand the center city
   or to perform a reverse reading in terms of its temporal consecutives
   looking at the periphery of Anatolia. For these reasons, the aim of the
   study is to reveal its contradictions, complexities, unknowns and the
   locally focused modernization experience in the periphery and to
   contribute to the history of modern architecture apart from the
   center-oriented architectural writing that includes homogeneous,
   measurable, generalizable assumptions. Giresun, located in the periphery
   of Anatolia, was placed at the center of the study, and the public
   buildings and urban arrangements built between the years of 1930-1980
   were evaluated in the axis of the center-periphery paradigm as the
   practices of the Republic modernization. In this context, the buildings
   in the study, which focuses on the buildings that still exist in the
   city, are grouped in relation to three concepts identified
   as{''}ideology{''}, ``ideal{''}and ``development{''} and the similar or
   different aspects of each group are examined in the context of periodic
   developments. Thus, the intervention of the center to the periphery and
   the local expansions of the modernization observed in peripheral cities
   are discussed by focusing on Giresun and this city and its buildings
   that could not find a place in researches of modern architectural
   history have been brought to the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Before implementing an Urban Freight Transport (UFT) solution, certainty
   is required about the effectiveness of the considered alternatives.
   Selecting an effective solution necessitates the engagement of all
   stakeholders involved in the management of the UFT system. The aim of
   the study is the formulation of a common assessment platform for
   facilitating the selection of the most appropriate UFT solution, taking
   into account the solutions' effectiveness and the stakeholder
   perceptions and consensus. Solution maturity, social acceptance, and
   user uptake, which are considered as the main drivers of stakeholders'
   engagement, are evaluated based on a real time Delphi survey, in
   parallel with solutions' sustainability dimensions (economy and energy,
   environment, society, transport, and mobility). The Delphi method
   emerges as a suitable tool in this direction as stakeholders' subjective
   judgments, and not analytical techniques, are required. The platform is
   demonstrated through the assessment of ten UFT solutions by 184
   stakeholders (public authorities, supply chain operators, and other
   interested groups) who reside in cities across the world. The results of
   the demonstration showed that Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
   for freight monitoring and electric vehicles are the highest rated
   solutions, while drone deliveries are the lowest, reaching respectively
   the highest and lowest consensus levels.}},

Abstract = {{For medical genetic counseling, estimating the chance of a child being
   born with chromosome abnormality is crucially important. Cytogenetic
   diagnostics of parents with a balanced karyotype are a special case.
   Such chromosome rearrangements cannot be detected with comprehensive
   chromosome screening. In the current paper, we consider chromosome
   diagnostics in two cases of chromosome rearrangement in patients with
   balanced karyotype and provide the results of a detailed analysis of
   complex chromosomal rearrangement (CCR) involving three chromosomes and
   a small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC) in a patient with
   impaired reproductive function. The application of fluorescent in situ
   hybridization, microdissection, and multicolor banding allows for
   describing analyzed karyotypes in detail. In the case of a CCR, such as
   the one described here, the probability of gamete formation with a
   karyotype, showing a balance of chromosome regions, is extremely low.
   Recommendation for the family in genetic counseling should take into
   account the obtained result. In the case of an sSMC, it is critically
   important to identify the original chromosome from which the sSMC has
   been derived, even if the euchromatin material is absent. Finally, we
   present our view on the optimal strategy of identifying and describing
   sSMCs, namely the production of a microdissectional DNA probe from the
   sSMC combined with a consequent reverse painting.}},

Abstract = {{The linear model of science-policy interaction presents scientific

   ``professor group on energy policy{''}, a voluntary and bottom-up
   science-policy initiative active in Finnish energy policy debates during
   2013-2017. The analysis is based on interviews, reports, news articles
   and observations. I assess both the engagement practices of the group
   and how they are justified and evaluated. The study demonstrates the
   prevalence of the linear model as a repertoire that different actors
   employ to order science and policy. The results point to the need to
   critically assess the context, politics and expectations related to

Abstract = {{A critique of multi-sectoral responses to the customary practice of
   ukuthwala (the isiXhosa term for abduction for purposes of marriage) in
   South Africa highlights attention to gendered tropes pertaining to
   marriage, custom, and sexual assault. Karimakwenda deconstructs how, in
   its inflexible framing of customary practice, the multi-sectoral
   campaign against violent forms of ukuthwala lacks historicization and
   silences women's narratives. By obscuring historical and
   locally-embedded linkages between marriage practices and rape, the
   myopic campaign energizes collective anxieties around representations of
   violence within Black communities, and fuels misconceptions surrounding
   marital rape. This critique contributes to debates about gender,
   violence, and state power by offering a counter-narrative to simplified
   characterizations of sexual violence and custom.}},

Abstract = {{This essay examines Fatima Mernissi's and Mohammed Arkoun's strategies
   of rereading central texts of the classical Islamic tradition in order
   to develop a contemporary normative grammar of critique. Mernissi
   reconsiders marginalized intellectuals and theoretical schools of
   Islamic history and derives immanent principles of justice. From a
   feminist perspective, she criticizes the dominantly patriarchal
   interpretations of Islamic foundational texts. Taking the classical
   humanism of Miskawayh as a point of departure, Arkoun carves out his
   conception of justice. Based on both Islamic religious ethics and
   antique Greek philosophy, he develops a transcultural humanism.
   Methodologically, Arkoun suggests a deconstructive examination of the
   classical Islamic texts to free Islamic thought from orthodox
   strictures. By way of conclusion, the article suggests that Mernissi's
   and Arkoun's progressive interpretation of the classical Islamic
   heritage may help to overcome the narrow, identitarian understanding of
   Islamic thought prevalent in both Muslim and Western societies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Endocuff Vision (ECV) is the second generation of a device
   designed to improve polyp detection. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate its impact on adenoma detection rate (ADR) in routine
   colonoscopy.
   Design This cluster-randomised crossover trial compared
   Endocuff-assisted (ECV+) with standard (ECV-) colonoscopy. Two teams of
   11 endoscopists each with prior ECV experience, balanced in terms of
   basal ADR, gender and case volume were compared. In randomised fashion,
   the teams started with ECV+ or ECV- and switched group after inclusion
   of half of the cases. The main outcome criterion was ADR difference
   between ECV+ and ECV-. Subgroup analysis was done for physicians with
   low and high ADR (< or >= 25\%).
   Results During two periods of 20 and 21 weeks, respectively, the 22
   endoscopists included 2058 patients (1032 ECV- vs 1026 ECV+, both groups
   being comparable). Overall ADR for both groups taken together was higher
   with ECV (39.2\%) than without (29.4\%; p<0.001) irrespective of the
   sequence of use (ECV+ or ECV- first), but mostly in adenomas <1 cm. In
   the physician subgroup analysis, only high detectors showed a
   significant ADR increase (from 31\% to 41\%, p<0.001), while the
   increase in the low detectors was not significant (from 24\% to 30\%,
   p=0.11). ECV had a positive impact in all colonic locations, except for
   the rectum. No ECV- related complication was reported.
   Conclusion We observed a significant ADR difference of approximately
   10\% by the use of ECV. By subgroup analysis, this increase was
   significant only in physicians classified as high detectors.}},

Abstract = {{For social analysis, cinema offers researchers a comprehensive data
   store. The time and space having been redesigned through cinematography
   cannot be shaped independently of the director's internalized
   ideological, social, cultural and political realities. The argument of
   the paper is the instrumentalization of the cinema to construct daily
   realities with discursive codes through the director's personal
   perceptions reflected to the film. Throughout the paper questions such
   as through which methods the director develops his cinematic language to
   shape the reality, how he reshapes society's realities to create a new
   image of The Prophet and what kind of motivations inspire him to
   practise a retrospective outlook are tried to be answered. Discourse
   analysis of our data has been carried out with the phenomenological
   method. In the analyses, it has been observed that theo-political
   associations such as language, lineage, ahl al-bayt, evaluation of past
   events with today's concepts play an active role in
   denominationally-constructed realities. The implications of contemporary
   Shiite views is conveyed to the audience with cinematographic techniques
   such the disruption of time integrity with flashbacks, the narrator of
   the film, the reflection of miracles with the deus ex machina technique,

Abstract = {{Painful cervical radiculopathy is characterized by chronic
   neuroinflammation that lowers endogenous antioxidant responses leading
   to the development of oxidative stress and pain after neural trauma.
   Therefore, antioxidants such as secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG),
   that promote antioxidant signaling and reduce oxidative damage may also
   provide pain relief. This study investigated if repeated systemic
   administration of synthetic SDG after a painful root compression reduces
   the established pain, oxidative stress and spinal glial activation that
   are typically evident. SDG was administered on days 1-3 after
   compression and the extent of oxidative damage in the dorsal root
   ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord was measured at day 7 using the oxidative
   stress markers 8-hydroxguanosine (8-OHG) and nitrotyrosine. Spinal
   microglial and astrocytic activation were also separately evaluated at
   day 7 after compression. In addition to reducing pain, SDG treatment
   reduced both spinal 8-OHG and nitrotyrosine, as well as peripheral 8-OHG
   in the DRG. Moreover, SDG selectively reduced glial activation by
   decreasing the extent of astrocytic but not microglial activation. These
   findings suggest that synthetic SDG may attenuate existing radicular
   pain by suppressing the oxidative stress and astrocytic activation that
   develop after painful injury, possibly identifying it as a potent
   therapeutic for painful radiculopathies.}},

Abstract = {{The Philadelphia region responded to the shortage of health care
   resources imposed by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic through the creation of
   the COVID-19 Surge Facility at Temple University's basketball arena. The
   facility was designed as an acute care medical unit capable of
   supporting COVID-19 patients who were stable enough to be released from
   the intensive care unit but not ready for discharge home. Safety was
   optimized through the application of recommendations from the Joint
   Commission and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The
   safety goals include those established by the Joint Commission with
   regard to patient identification, security, identification of patient
   safety threats, communication, fire safety, laboratory services, and
   pharmacologic services. COVID-19-specific goals outlined by the CDC also
   are addressed and include recommendations for facility layout, managing
   staff respite and personal protective equipment, patient care areas,
   supply storage, airflow, and patient hygiene. Although the goal was to
   meet all of these recommendations, some were not possible due to the
   austere environment of the arena. However, these shortcomings were met
   with innovative solutions that provided the next best options. By
   sharing these experiences, the authors hope to guide future alternate

Title = {{Decent work and work-family enrichment: role of meaning at work and work
   engagement}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of the current study is to examine decent work (DW)
   as a critical antecedent of work-family enrichment (WFE). Further, it
   also focuses on understanding the underlying mechanisms that facilitate
   the linkage of employees' perceptions of DW and WFE by investigating
   about the mediating role of knowledge workers' experience of meaning at
   work and their work engagement levels. Design/methodology/approach This
   study adopts a quantitative cross-sectional research design using survey
   administration among faculty members employed in public and private
   universities of North India. Findings Results depicted that in addition
   to direct relationship between DW and WFE, both meaning at work and work
   engagement partially mediate the relationship between access to DW and
   WFE indirectly. These findings showed that the provision of access to DW
   by organizations will help facilitate WFE via employees' experience of
   meaning at work and their levels of engagement with their work.
   Practical implications The study findings would be useful for
   organizational practitioners and policymakers to design sustainable
   human resource development (HRD) policies and practices for enriching
   the WFE of employees as well as in driving talent retention and
   engagement. Originality/value It is one of the few studies that captures
   perceptions of employees about access to DW policies and practices and
   its role in enhancing WFE in the South Asian context. Further, it also
   advances our knowledge on antecedents and consequences of WFE.}},

Title = {{In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of lncRNA XIST Reveals a Panel of

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been associated with a number of
   diseases including cancer. A well-studied lncRNA called XIST (X-inactive
   specific transcript) acts as a major effector of the X-inactivation
   process. It is expressed on the inactive X chromosome providing a dosage
   equivalence between males and females. Recently XIST has been implicated
   in the development of lung cancer. Using a bioinformatics approach, we
   demonstrate the XIST is over-expressed in female patients compared to
   males. When XIST gene was silenced in two different cell lines (of male
   and female origin), a number of genes were differentially expressed;
   playing a role in signal transduction pathways, energy balance and
   metabolism, thus providing a better insight of the role of this lncRNA
   in cancer. Finally, we showed that expression of XIST with another 4
   genes provided a strong diagnostic potential to discriminate lung cancer
   from healthy controls.
   Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) perform a wide functional repertoire of
   roles in cell biology, ranging from RNA editing to gene regulation, as
   well as tumour genesis and tumour progression. The lncRNA X-inactive
   specific transcript (XIST) is involved in the aetiopathogenesis of
   non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its role at the molecular
   level is not fully elucidated. The expression of XIST and co-regulated
   genes TSIX, hnRNPu, Bcl-2, and BRCA1 analyses in lung cancer (LC) and
   controls were performed in silico. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
   were determined using RNA-seq in H1975 and A549 NSCLC cell lines
   following siRNA for XIST. XIST exhibited sexual dimorphism, being
   up-regulated in females compared to males in both control and LC patient
   cohorts. RNA-seq revealed 944 and 751 DEGs for A549 and H1975 cell
   lines, respectively. These DEGs are involved in signal transduction,
   cell communication, energy pathways, and nucleic acid metabolism. XIST
   expression associated with TSIX, hnRNPu, Bcl-2, and BRCA1 provided a
   strong collective feature to discriminate between controls and LC,
   implying a diagnostic potential. There is a much more complex role for
   XIST in lung cancer. Further studies should concentrate on sex-specific
   changes and investigate the signalling pathways of the DEGs following
   silencing of this lncRNA.}},

Abstract = {{While traditional multiple testing procedures prohibit adaptive analysis
   choices made by users, Goeman and Solari (Statist. Sci. 26 (2011)
   584-597) proposed a simultaneous inference framework that allows users
   such flexibility while preserving high-probability bounds on the false
   discovery proportion (FDP) of the chosen set. In this paper, we propose
   a new class of such simultaneous FDP bounds, tailored for nested
   sequences of rejection sets. While most existing simultaneous FDP bounds
   are based on closed testing using global null tests based on sorted
   p-values, we additionally consider the setting where side information
   can be leveraged to boost power, the variable selection setting where
   knockoff statistics can be used to order variables, and the online
   setting where decisions about rejections must be made as data arrives.
   Our finite-sample, closed form bounds are based on repurposing the FDP
   estimates from false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures
   designed for each of the above settings. These results establish a novel
   connection between the parallel literatures of simultaneous FDP bounds
   and FDR control methods, and use proof techniques employing martingales
   and filtrations that are new to both these literatures. We demonstrate
   the utility of our results by augmenting a recent knockoffs analysis of
   the UK Biobank dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Acitretin, a 2nd generation retinoid, is a drug of choice for the
   treatment of severe psoriasis. Presently, only capsule formulation for
   oral administration is commercially available and associated with
   limitations of severe systemic side effects. In the present study,
   carrier elastic liposomal and ethosomal based topical gel formulations
   were developed, optimized, and characterized in-vitro, ex-vivo, and
   in-vivo to provide effective skin targeting of acitretin. In-vitro
   characterization exhibited nanometric vesicle size range (591 +/- 16 and
   360 +/- 14 nm), high encapsulation efficacy (94.7 +/- 2.1\% and 91.2 +/-
   1.6\%), optimum viscosity (1152 and 1320 cP), thixotropic behavior and
   good storage stability of the developed formulation. Ex-vivo skin
   permeation and deposition studies carried on four different biological
   membranes (rat, mice, porcine ear, and human cadaver skin) showed higher
   skin deposition of prepared carrier-based gels in comparison to plain
   acitretin gel. Better skin localization potential was also confirmed by
   mechanistic studies using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy and
   Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis. In-vivo antipsoriatic activity
   demonstrated the better therapeutic efficacy of carrier-based
   formulations. Thus, developed formulation seems to be a safe and
   promising alternative to oral route for effective topical delivery of
   acitretin with improved pharmacological activity and no systemic
   toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is commonly used to treat
   vestibular schwannomas (VSs). The risk of complications from GKRS
   decreases at lower doses, but it is unknown if long-term tumor control
   is negatively affected by dose reduction. Study Design: This was a
   retrospective case review and analysis of patient data. Setting:
   Tertiary referral center. Patients: Patients with VSs who underwent GKRS
   between 1990 and 2007 at the authors' institution. Intervention(s): The
   subjects were divided into two cohorts based on the prescribed doses of
   radiation received: a 12 Gy cohort (96 patients) with a follow-up period
   of 124 months and a >12 Gy cohort (118 patients) with a follow-up period
   of 143 months. Main Outcome Measures: Tumor control rates at 10 to 15
   years, frequency of facial and trigeminal nerve complications, and
   hearing function. Results: The 10 to 15-year tumor control rates were
   95\% in the 12 Gy cohort and 88\% in the > 12 Gy cohort, but the
   differences were not significant. Compared with the >12 Gy cohort,
   facial and trigeminal nerve deficits occurred significantly less
   frequently in the 12 Gy cohort, with the 10-year cumulative, permanent
   deficit-free rates being 2\% and 0\%, respectively. Multivariate
   analyses revealed that treatment doses exceeding 12 Gy were associated
   with a significantly higher risk for cranial nerve deficits. The
   percentage of subjects retaining pure-tone average <= 50 dB at the final
   follow-up did not significantly differ between the cohorts (12 Gy
   cohort, 30\% and >12 Gy cohort, 33\%; p = 0.823). Conclusions: Dose
   reduction to 12 Gy for GKRS to treat VSs decreased facial and trigeminal
   nerve complications without worsening tumor control rates.}},

Abstract = {{The population of immigrants in the U.S. continues to grow, with more
   than one million immigrants arriving every year. This study examines the
   acculturation of new immigrant and temporary resident children and their
   parents from Japan, as they navigate two cultures and seek a sense of
   belonging. Acculturation to a new culture poses various psychosocial
   challenges, including a loss of a sense of belonging, which can result
   in social isolation and withdrawal. Examination of the experiences of
   families from Japan, where group belonging is highly valued, can
   illuminate the role of belonging in acculturation. We examined
   individual interviews with 14 Japanese parents in U.S. southern cities.
   During the interviews, they described the experiences of a total of 23
   children from preschool to 9th grade. Parents indicated an absence of a
   place for children where they feel a sense of belonging (i.e., Ibasho)
   in their local schools, which resulted in social isolation,
   psychological exhaustion, and a reluctance to seek support. Children,
   however, found their Ibasho at a Japanese Supplementary School, where
   they attended weekly to receive academic instruction in Japanese,
   enjoyed playing with Japanese friends, and gained energy to navigate
   challenges at their local schools. The Supplementary School also served
   as parents' Ibasho where they exchanged information to navigate
   cross-cultural experiences. This study has implications for how we can
   better support acculturation of new immigrant and temporary resident
   families including those from other cultural groups.}},

Abstract = {{Lipids are biomolecules extracted from plant sources and plant residues
   and have a beneficial role in various food, nutrition and medical
   applications. Supercritical carbon-dioxide as an advanced highpressure
   technology which increases the productivity and has negligible
   environmental impact is employed for the selective extraction of polar
   lipids from the lipid matrix in mango kernel for the first time. The
   process parameters affecting the extraction such as pressure,
   temperature and the flow rate of CO2 are ranged in the intervals of
   30-50 MPa, 40-60 degrees C and 10-30 g min(-1), respectively.
   Optimization using Box Behnken design obtained the highest yield of
   3.38\% at 40 degrees C, 50 MPa and 30 g min(-1). The phosphorous content
   was evaluated to understand the behaviour of polar lipids extraction at
   higher pressures. The study showed the effect of process parameters
   having significant influence on polarity and solvating capacity of CO2
   which enabled for the extraction of polar lipids adding value to the
   mango kernel converting waste into valuable industrial products. The
   economic evaluation estimates the return on investment of a plant
   processing 3000 tons of mango kernel per year to account net present
   value (NPV) almost five times higher than the investment expenses and
   the payback period is under 4 years. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Clinical empathy is the ability to understand the patient's experience,
   communicate that understanding, and act on it. There is evidence that
   patient and physician benefits are associated with more empathic
   communications. These include higher patient and physician satisfaction,
   improved quality of life, and decreased professional burnout for
   physicians, as well as increased patient compliance with care plans.
   Empathy appears to decline during medical school, residency training,
   and early professional emergency medicine practice; however, brief
   training has the potential to improve behavioral measures of empathy.
   Improvements in emergency department physician empathy seems especially
   important in managing patients at elevated risk for opioid-related harm.
   We describe our conceptual approach to identifying and designing a
   practice improvement curriculum aimed to cultivate and improve
   behavioral empathy among practicing emergency physicians. Emergent
   themes from our preliminary study of interviews, focus groups, and
   workshops were identified and analyzed for feasibility, sensitivity to
   change, and potential impact. A conceptual intervention will address the
   following key categories: patient stigmatization, identification of
   problematic pain-subtypes, empathic communication skills, interactions
   with family and friends, and techniques to manage inappropriate patient
   requests. The primary outcomes will be the changes in behavioral empathy
   associated with training. An assessment battery was chosen to measure
   physician psychosocial beliefs, attitudes and behavior, communication
   skills, and burnout magnitude. Additional outcomes will include opioid
   prescribing practice, naloxone prescribing, and referrals to addiction
   treatment. A pilot study will allow an estimation of the intervention
   impact to help finalize a curriculum suitable for web-based national
   implementation.}},

Title = {{On ride-pooling and traffic congestion}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{213-231}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ridesourcing platforms, such as Uber, Lyft and Didi, are now launching
   commercial on demand ride-pooling programs that enable their affiliated
   drivers to serve two or more passengers in one ride. It is generally
   expected that successful designs of ride-pooling programs can reduce the
   required vehicle fleet size, and achieve various societally beneficial
   objectives, such as alleviating traffic congestion. The reduction in
   traffic congestion can in turn save travel time for both ridesourcing
   passengers and normal private car users. However, it is still unclear to
   what extent the implementation of ride-pooling affects traffic
   congestion and riders' travel time. To this end, this paper establishes
   a model to describe the ridesourcing markets with congestion effects,
   which are explicitly characterized by a macroscopic fundamental diagram.
   We compare the time cost (sum of travel time and waiting time) of
   ridesourcing passengers and normal private car users (background
   traffic) in the ridesourcing markets without ride-pooling (each vehicle
   serves one passenger) and with ride-pooling (each vehicle serves one or
   more passengers). It is found that, a win-win situation can be achieved
   under some scenarios such that the implementation of on-demand
   ride-pooling reduces the time cost for both ridesourcing passengers and
   private car users. Furthermore, we find that the matching window is a
   key decision variable the platform leverages to affect the stationary
   equilibrium state. As the matching window increases, passengers are
   expected to wait for longer time, but the pool-matching probability (the
   proportion of passengers who are pool-matched) increases, which further
   alleviates traffic congestion and in turn reduces passengers' travel
   time. It is interesting to find that, there is a globally optimal
   matching window for achieving the minimum time cost for ridesourcing
   passengers in the normal flow regime. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{All-solid-state lithium metal batteries with inorganic solid
   electrolytes are capable to deliver a high theoretical energy density
   and work safely in a common battery operating condition. However, one
   critical issue facing all-solid-state lithium metal batteries is the
   ``short{''} and ``unstable{''} cycling performance. Cell failures might
   origin from various roots, including ``unstable{''} interphase
   formation, ``uncontrolled{''} penetration of lithium dendrites,
   ``bad{''} interfacial compatibility and ``irreversible{''} volume change
   of electrode/electrolyte materials. In this effort, we focus on
   comprehensively discussing the lithium dendrite formation that leads to
   cell failures of all-solid-state lithium metal batteries with inorganic
   solid electrolytes. We summarize possible roots for the lithium dendrite
   formation through the inorganic solid electrolytes, and provide
   strategies to suppress the growth and propagation of lithium dendrites
   to alleviate cell failures of all-solid-state lithium metal batteries
   with inorganic solid electrolytes. We believe this focused review will
   help to better understand the formation mechanisms of lithium dendrites,
   and their roles in cell failures of all-solid-state lithium metal

Title = {{Bioclimatic modeling of potential vegetation types as an alternative to
   species distribution models for projecting plant species shifts under
   changing climates}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{477}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Land managers need new tools for planning novel futures due to climate
   change. Species distribution modeling (SDM) has been used extensively to
   predict future distributions of species under different climates, but
   their map products are often too coarse for fine-scale operational use.
   In this study we developed a flexible, efficient, and robust method for
   mapping current and future distributions and abundances of vegetation
   species and communities at the fine spatial resolutions that are germane
   to land management. First, we mapped Potential Vegetation Types (PVTs)
   using conventional statistical modeling techniques (Random Forests) that
   used bioclimatic ecosystem process and climate variables as predictors.
   We obtained over 50\% accuracy across 13 mapped PVTs for our study area.
   We then applied future climate projections as climate input to the
   Random Forest model to generate future PVT maps, and used field data
   describing the occurrence of tree and non-tree species in each PVT
   category to model and map species distribution for current and future
   climate. These maps were then compared to two previous SDM mapping
   efforts with over 80\% agreement and equivalent accuracy. Because PVTs
   represent the biophysical potential of the landscape to support
   vegetation communities as opposed to the vegetation that currently
   exists, they can be readily linked to climate forecasts and correlated
   with other, climate-sensitive ecological processes significant in land
   management, such as fire regimes and site productivity.}},

Abstract = {{The orbit closures of regular model sets generated from a
   cut-and-project scheme given by a co-compact lattice L subset of G x H
   and compact and aperiodic window W subset of H, have the maximal
   equicontinuous factor (MEF) (G x H)/L, if the window is toplogically
   regular. This picture breaks down, when the window has empty interior,
   in which case the MEF is trivial, although (G x H)/L continues to be the
   Kronecker factor for the Mirsky measure. As this happens for many
   interesting examples like the square-free numbers or the visible lattice
   points, a weaker concept of topological factors is needed, like that of
   generic factors {[}24]. For topological dynamical systems that possess a
   finite invariant measure with full support (E-systems) we prove the
   existence of a maximal equicontinuous generic factor (MEGF) and
   characterize it in terms of the regional proximal relation. This part of
   the paper profits strongly from previous work by McMahon {[}33] and
   Auslander {[}2]. In Sections 3 and 4 we determine the MEGF of orbit
   closures of weak model sets and use this result for an alternative proof
   (of a generalization) of the fact {[}34] that the centralizer of any
   B-free dynamical system of Erdos type is trivial.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: While global awareness of HIV disease has grown
   exponentially due to public awareness initiatives, the specifics of the
   impact of being HIV positive in patients presenting with brain tumours
   is lacking.
   Materials and methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study
   consecutively enrolling all subjects with a neoplastic brain tumour from
   the 01 July 2018-31 March 2020. The data collected in this study
   included age, gender, HIV status, admission absolute CD4 count,
   radiological diagnosis, blood loss, length of surgery, extent of
   resection, histological diagnosis, nosocomial infection incidence, and
   Glasgow Outcome Score.
   Results: In total 101 subjects were enrolled in the study which
   comprised 65/101 (64\%) HIV negative subjects and 36/101 (36\%) HIV
   positive subjects. In terms of HIV result and admission absolute CD4
   count, significance was demonstrated (p < 0.001). Considering
   radiological tumour diagnosis and HIV result a significant relationship
   was demonstrated, favouring meningiomas and pituitary tumours in the HIV
   negative cohort, and high-grade glioma and metastasis in the HIV
   positive cohort (p = 0.04). Of the 101 subjects enrolled in the study,
   78 were taken for operative intervention and of these 50/78 (64\%) were
   HIV negative and 28/78 (36\%) were HIV positive. Regarding length of
   surgery, while no significance was demonstrated (p = 0.72), a clinical
   trend was suggested that elective brain tumour surgery takes longer in
   HIV positive patients. With regards extent of resection significance was
   demonstrated, favouring gross total resection in the HIV negative
   cohort, and subtotal resection in the HIV positive cohort (p = 0.0025).
   Conclusion: In our study significance was demonstrated between HIV
   result and radiological tumour diagnosis. We further demonstrated
   significance between HIV result and admission CD4 count. According to a
   PubMed review we are the first to suggest a trend for surgery to take
   longer in HIV positive patients, as well as report the significance of
   the extent of resection.}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   Differences in the composition of immune cell infiltrate between
   individual tumors have been shown to have prognostic significance in
   several cancer types. In gastric cancer, both assessing immune cell
   infiltrate from routinely hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides and
   immunohistochemically stained slides seems promising. In this study, we
   assessed immune cell infiltrates by their hematoxylin-eosin-based
   Klintrup-Makinen (KM) grades in a large cohort of 741 gastric cancer
   patients and compared them with immunohistochemistry-based immune cell
   scores. The KM grades had more prognostic value in the study cohort than
   the immune cell scores. Based on our results, the KM grade has good
   prognostic value in gastric cancer. Immunohistochemical stainings of
   lymphocytes might not provide additional prognostic information over
   routinely stained hematoxylin-eosin slides.
   Purpose: To examine and compare the prognostic value of immune cell
   score (ICS) and Klintrup-Makinen (KM) grade in gastric cancer. Methods:
   Gastric adenocarcinoma tissues from samples of 741 patients surgically
   treated in two hospitals in Finland were assessed for ICS and KM grade.
   Cox regression with adjustment for confounders provided hazard ratios
   (HRs) and 95\% CIs. Subgroup analyses were performed in intestinal and
   diffuse type subgroups. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival.
   Results: High ICS was associated to longer 5-year survival (adjusted HR
   0.70, 95\% CI 0.52-0.94), compared to low ICS. The difference was
   significant in intestinal type subgroup (adjusted HR 0.54, 95\% CI
   0.36-0.81) but not in diffuse type subgroup (adjusted HR 0.92, 95\% CI
   0.58-1.46). High KM grade was an independent prognostic factor for
   longer 5-year overall survival (adjusted HR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.45-0.77) in
   both intestinal (adjusted HR 0.61, 95\% CI 0.44-0.85) and diffuse
   subgroups (adjusted HR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.31-0.86). ICS and KM grade were
   moderately correlated (rho = 0.425). When both immune cell score and KM
   grade were included in the regression analysis, only KM grade remained
   prognostic. Conclusions: Both ICS and KM grade are prognostic factors in
   gastric adenocarcinoma, but immunohistochemistry-based ICS might not
   have additional prognostic value over hematoxylin-eosin-based KM grade.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To evaluate the efficacy of a novel hydrogel sheet in preventing
   postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF).
   Background Postoperative pancreatic fistula is a life-threatening
   complication. As no study has reported the use of hydrogel sheets in
   preventing POPF, their effectiveness for that purpose remains unclear.
   Methods A novel hydrogel sheet made of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was
   prepared by the freeze-thaw method. The pancreatic ducts and surrounding
   pancreatic parenchyma of rats were transected to induce a pancreatic
   fistula. Next, the sheet was attached to the transection site. Ascitic
   fluid amylase and lipase concentrations were measured. Neoveil(R), a
   nonwoven polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt, is already clinically used as an
   absorbable reinforcing material at pancreatic transection sites.
   Neoveil(R) was used for comparison, as was VIEWGEL(R), which is marketed
   as a wound dressing.
   Results The hydrogel sheet remained in place 48 hours postoperatively.
   The ascitic amylase concentrations in the control, VIEWGEL(R)-treated,
   Neoveil(R)-treated, and hydrogel-treated rats, respectively, were 4992.4
   +/- 5355.7, 1068.4 +/- 269.1, 730.2 +/- 425.2, and 303.1 +/- 240.1 IU/L;
   the ascitic lipase concentrations were 2279.8 +/- 3395.2, 169.5 +/-
   100.6, 90.4 +/- 71.0, and 86.8 +/- 59.8 IU/L. The ascitic amylase and
   lipase levels were significantly lower in the hydrogel group than in the
   other groups (P < .05).
   Conclusions This novel hydrogel sheet effectively prevents pancreatic
   fistulas and has promising clinical application potential.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Sleep disturbance is a key contributor to posthospital
   syndrome; a transient period of vulnerability following discharge from
   hospital. We sought to examine the relationship between patient-reported
   hospital quietness at night, via a validated survey, and unplanned
   hospital readmissions among hospitalized seniors (ages 65 and older) in
   Alberta, Canada. Design: Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of
   survey responses, linked with administrative inpatient records. Setting:
   Using the Canadian Patient Experiences Survey-Inpatient Care and
   Discharge Abstract Database, patients aged 65 and older, and living with
   one or more chronic conditions were identified. Participants: Of all, 25
   674 respondents discharged from hospital between April 2014 and December
   2017. Main Outcome Measure: All-cause, unplanned readmission within 30
   or 90 days (yes vs no). Results: Approximately half (50.5\%) of the
   respondents reported that the area around their room was always quiet at
   night. Eight (8.1\%) percent of respondents (2066) were readmitted
   within 30 days (2241 total readmissions), while 15.6\% (4000) were
   readmitted within 90 days (5070 total readmissions). When controlling
   for a variety of demographic and clinical factors, patients not
   reporting ``always{''} to the survey question regarding hospital
   quietness at night had slightly greater odds of readmission within 30
   (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR] = 1.32, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]:
   1.20-1.45) and 90 days (aOR = 1.14, 95\% CI: 1.06-1.23). Conclusion: Our
   results demonstrate a clear association between patient-reported
   hospital quietness at night and subsequent readmission within the first
   30 and 90 days following discharge. Efforts to minimize hospital noise,
   particularly at night, may help promote a restful environment, while
   reducing readmissions among older patients living with chronic
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{According to many recent studies, ice cream was found to be an effective
   carrier of probiotics along the human gastrointestinal tract. While
   probiotics have long been known to improve gut health,
   prebiotic-supplemented ice creams have demonstrated properties that
   could be linked to various health benefits and improvement of the gut
   microbiota. In this study, riceberry and sesame-riceberry milk ice
   creams were supplemented with inulin, Lactobacillus casei 01 and
   Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 to examine the changes of probiotic
   populations in different formulations of ice cream. The survivability of
   probiotics after 60 days of frozen storage and the level of viable cell
   tolerance towards the simulated gastrointestinal environment were also
   assessed, followed by sensory evaluation with 100 untrained panelists
   and determination of chemical qualities of ice cream samples. Findings
   revealed L. casei 01 to be more resistant to frozen storage compared to
   L. acidophilus LA5, whereas addition of sesame milk and inulin were
   shown to minimize levels of viable cell loss following environmental and
   mechanical stress, suggesting enhanced probiotic activity. Significant
   reductions in probiotic viability were observed for all ice cream
   samples, however higher survival rates were observed in
   prebiotic-supplemented samples prior to and after 60 days of frozen
   storage. Probiotic cell counts in all samples exceeded the minimum
   recommended value (6 log CFU/g). In simulated gastric and bile fluid,
   all samples illustrated a significant change in probiotic levels, which
   significantly decreased with increase time of exposure to acidic and
   basic conditions. Probiotic strains in samples containing riceberry,
   sesame and inulin demonstrated greatest survivability as observed by
   reduction in pH and increased total acidity, with increased antioxidant
   and phenolic contents. On the other hand, changes in physicochemical
   properties of ice cream lowered overall sensory scores in terms of color
   and flavor. This study contributes to future development and
   applications of riceberry and sesame for inducement of synbiotic effects
