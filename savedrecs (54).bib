Abstract = {{Laennec invented the stethoscope in 1816 and published a treatise on
   auscultation in 1819. We then had to wait until the 1950s to observe
   develop ment of modern devices and methods of recording and
   signal-processing, which allowed objective studies of lung sounds in
   time and frequency fields.
   Tracheobronchial sounds generated by ventilation originate in the upper
   airways, the frequency content of these sounds has led to extensive
   research, Consolidated lungs act as more efficient sound conductors to
   the chest wall (bronchial breathing murmur), Tracheobronchial sounds
   contain higher frequency components compared to vesicular lung sounds.
   The origin of vesicular lung sounds has been becoming progressively
   clear for about 10 yrs. It is at least partly produced locally, deep,
   and probably intralobular, Clearly, further studies need to be performed
   in order to elucidate the true mechanisms involved in generating
   vesicular lung sounds, the redistribution of intrapulmonary gas or
   vibrations caused by the stretching of lung tissue.
   The devices developed are already useful for monitoring the state of
   patients in intensive care, Sooner or later, real time analysis and
   automated diagnosis will become available.}},

   members of a Roman household (a matron, a slave, and a father

   Comparisons with kline sculptures, funerary reliefs of craftsmen, and
   shield portraits suggest a social background for the family among
   freedmen and their descendants in Rome and Ostia in the early second
   century A.D. Recent scholarship on the Roman family provides the basis
   for a discussion of the significance of commemorative art in rituals of
   mourning. Rather than documenting the transmission of wealth in the
   family, as previously thought, the relief indicates that the family
   properly honored its dead by commemorating them with works of art, which
   effectively transformed the dead into ancestors.}},

Abstract = {{Five preparations of alpha-quartz {[}Min-U-Sil 5 (MQZ), MQZ pretreated
   with hydrofluoric acid (HFMQZ), Chinese standard alpha-quartz (CSQZ),
   and two German samples, DQ-12 and F600] and two preparations of the
   crystalline silica polymorphs, cristobalite and tridymite, previously
   characterized for surface area and surface charge, were evaluated for
   their relative activities in the following assays: (i) in vitro assays
   of short duration (less than or equal to 15 min) for oxygen consumption
   and for generation of hydroxyl radicals (measured by electron spin
   resonance spin trapping), and (ii) in vitro assays of longer duration
   for DNA strand breakage (measured using linear DNA as a detector
   molecule) and for production of the oxidized DNA base, thymine glycol
   (measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). Marked differences
   among the samples were found for their levels of oxygen consumption and
   of hydroxyl radicals' generation. All samples caused increased formation
   of thymine glycol, with wide variations in activity among samples. When
   normalized for equal surface area, the samples produced different levels
   of DNA strand breakage. Addition of hydrogen peroxide strongly
   accelerated DNA damage-more for cristobalite than for the alpha-quartz
   samples. DNA damage by quartz was enhanced by ferric chloride and
   inhibited by iron chelators. The order of relative activity of the
   samples varied with different types of in vitro assays and was not
   directly correlated to surface area. Electrophoretic mobility, as
   measured by zeta potential, was not significantly different among
   samples. The results suggest that the ability of different crystalline
   silica samples to generate a rapid burst of oxygen free radicals is
   distinct from their ability to induce DNA damage and DNA base oxidation
   over longer time periods. The relative activities of the samples in
   cellular assays (hemolysis of human erythrocytes; cytotoxicity and
   neoplastic transformation of BALB/3T3/A31 . 1 . 1 cells) were in turn
   markedly different from those listed above, suggesting a more critical
   role for surface area. The mechanisms of carcinogenesis by crystalline
   silica need to be further investigated in relation 60 the underlying
   physicochemical characteristics. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Almokalant, a recently developed potassium-channel blocker, has
   exhibited properties of a selective class III agent in vitro and in
   animal experiments. We report the first invasive study in humans in
   which the electrophysiological characteristics of almokalant were
   assessed. Thirty-four healthy males received bolus and maintenance
   infusions of almokalant to two of four target plasma concentrations of
   20, 50, 100, and 150 nM. Electrophysiological variables were assessed
   during stimulation at 100 and 120 beats/min at baseline and at two
   consecutive targeted levels. Almokalant dose-dependently increased the
   duration of the monophasic action potential (MAP) above a mean plasma
   concentration of 60 nM. The duration at 90\% repolarization
   significantly increased by 20\% from baseline at 100 beats/min (p <
   0.00005), and by 19\% at 120 beats/min (p < 0.00005), at a mean plasma
   concentration of 116 nM. During atrial stimulation, there was a
   significant increase in the QT interval, amounting to 24\% at 100
   beats/min (p < 0.00005) and to 30\% at 120 beats/min (p = 0.0006), at
   124 nM. During right ventricular stimulation in the apical region, the
   QT interval significantly increased by 17\% at 100 beats/min (p <
   0.00005), and 13\% at 120 beats/min (p < 0.00005). During stimulation
   from the right ventricular outflow tract, the QT interval increased to a
   lesser extent and significantly only at 120 beats/min: 9\% at 100
   beats/min (p = NS) and 6\% at 120 beats/min (p = 0.001) at 118 nM. The
   effective refractory period (ERP) of the atria increased by 18\% at 100
   beats/min at 119 nM (p = 0.005). The right ventricular ERP increased by
   16\% at both heart rates (HR) (p < 0.00005) during stimulation from the
   apical region, and by 11\% during stimulation from the outflow tract (p
   = 0.0001 at 100 beats/min and p = 0.0006 at 120 beats/min). There was no
   effect on the ERP of the atrioventricular node, (AVN) on the sinus node
   function or cardiac conduction. Two individuals experienced a transient
   metallic taste during bolus infusion aiming at 50 and 100 nM, but this
   side effect did not occur in the group receiving the highest doses.
   Pronounced T-wave/U-wave (TU) morphology changes were observed in 4
   individuals. Almokalant exhibited characteristics of a pure class III
   agent with no effects on cardiac conduction or sinus node function when
   given intravenously. Although no proarrhythmias were observed, the
   development of TU morphology changes and increased spatial dispersion of
   repolarization after the highest doses warrants further studies
   regarding the safety profile of the drug.}},

Abstract = {{Galactose metabolism in all organisms is catalyzed by three enzymatic
   steps: the galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, and
   UDP galactose 4'-epimerase reactions, We report here the molecular
   cloning, characterization, and mapping of a full-length cDNA encoding
   human UDP-galactose 4'-epimerase (GALE). Our cDNA is 1488 bp long and
   matches the mRNA size of 1.5 kb detected in fibroblasts and
   lymphoblasts. The human GALE cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 348
   amino acids with a molecular mass of 38,266. The human GALE enzyme is
   87\% identical to the rat protein, 53\% identical to the homologous
   GAL10 protein from the yeast KLuyveromyces lactis, and 51\% identical to
   the galE protein from the prokaryote Escherichia coli. This
   extraordinary degree of sequence identity has allowed us to build a
   homology model of the human protein based on the bacterial crystal
   structure. This predicted human structure is very similar to the E. coli
   galE enzyme, suggesting that both enzymes use similar mechanisms. The
   human gene encoding GALE maps, as expected, to a single locus on
   chromosome 1 and appears to be compact. The human GALE gene is
   structurally intact in 19 patients with epimerase-deficiency
   galactosemia, an inborn error of metabolism secondary to GALE
   deficiency, Therefore, we propose that this disorder is due to small
   mutations within the gene. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is good evidence of a relationship between certain
   personality factors (viz. neuroticism and hypochondriasis) in the
   reporting of somatic symptoms-both in clinical and in nonclinical
   research-the recognition of the moderating role of individual
   differences in the frequency and intensity of side effect reporting is
   virtually absent from drug trial research. This study was a double-blind
   moclobemide-versus-placebo trial, the purpose of which was twofold: to
   investigate the degree of side effect complaints in a sample of healthy
   nonclinical men and women and to assess the role of personality in
   symptom reporting. Although there was no overall difference between the
   groups with respect to side effect complaints, there was a highly
   significant neuroticism x group x time interaction. In both groups, we
   found the expected positive relationship between neuroticism and symptom
   reporting at baseline. At the end of the study, however, this
   relationship was close to zero in the moclobemide group and had
   increased to close to 0.60 in the placebo group. These results were
   essentially replicated when neuroticism was substituted in the
   regression model by a psychometric measure of hypochondriasis. Our
   findings provide a striking demonstration of the role of personality
   factors in the placebo adverse response. As well, they indicate that
   adverse reactions to the medication were also linked to personality
   differences. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of
   considering individual differences in all aspects of pharmacologic
   research that involve subjective interpretation on the part of patients
   and subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the precision (interobserver agreement) and
   accuracy (agreement with criterion standard) of clinical and
   radiological signs in premature infants at risk of patent ductus
   arteriosus (PDA) with left-to-right shunting.
   Design: Masked comparison of clinical and radiological examination with
   Doppler flow echocardiography (criterion standard).
   Setting: Neonatal intensive care unit.
   Patients: One hundred infants with birth weights less than 1750 g were
   studied once between days 3 and 7 of life. A third of the cohort was
   intubated at the time of study.
   Intervention: Five independent observers noted the presence or absence
   of an increased pulse volume, an active precordium, a heart murmur, a
   cardiothoracic ratio greater than 60\%, increased pulmonary vascular
   markings on a concurrent chest x-ray film, and a relative increase of
   the cardiothoracic ratio compared with that from the previous chest
   x-ray film. Pulsed and color flow Doppler echocardiography was performed
   within 4 hours. All 100 tapes were reviewed by a second pediatric
   cardiologist.
   Results: Twenty-three infants had a PDA with left-to-right shunting. The
   precision of clinical signs was modest, with average kappa values of
   0.15 for pulse volume, 0.32 for precordium, and 0.41 for murmur. Pulse
   quality (43\%) and murmur (42\%) had the highest mean sensitivities.
   Corresponding specificities were 74\% for pulse volume and 87\% for
   murmur. The combination of a cardiac murmur with an abnormal pulse
   volume had the highest positive predictive value (77\%). The
   radiological examination did not improve the observers' ability to
   distinguish between patients with and without PDA.
   Conclusions: The precision and accuracy of clinical and radiological
   signs of a PDA with left-to-right shunting are unsatisfactory.
   Therefore, Doppler flow echocardiography is required to diagnose PDA
   confidently in preterm infants between days 3 and 7 of life.}},

   presenting thrombosis in the absence of aPLA. F1+2 levels were not
   significantly increased in any group of aPLA patients, while a
   significant increase in D-Dimers in the aPLA group could not be
   specifically related to the presence of aPLA. Conversely, thrombomodulin
   was significant increased in all aPLA groups relative to controls or
   patients without aPLA, which confirms the pathogenic influence of aPLA
   on vascular endothelium and suggests this could be one of the
   contributing factors in the development of prothrombotic states.}},

   can also be demonstrated. The decreased saturation after IEF indicates
   that the affinity of transferrin for aluminum is low compared with its

Abstract = {{We used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in the assessment of
   salt sensitivity in 40 essential hypertensive patients, comparing 24-h
   mean blood pressure during 7 days of low salt (20 mmol NaCl/day) and
   high salt (260 mmol NaCl/day) intake, Salt sensitivity was diagnosed in
   18 essential hypertensive patients (45\%), each of them showing a
   significant increase in mean blood pressure (P <.05) from low to high
   salt diet. Salt-sensitive patients exhibited a high-salt-dependent
   increase in all blood pressure parameters including 24-h systolic, mean,
   diastole blood pressure, blood pressure load, area under the curve, and
   awake and asleep blood pressure values. These patients exhibited a
   nondipper profile on both low-salt and high-salt diets. Salt-resistant
   patients (55\%) showed a decrease in awake, and an increase in asleep
   blood pressure values after high salt intake, thus tending to flatten
   the circadian blood pressure profile. We conclude that ABPM is a useful
   method to assess salt sensitivity. In salt-resistant patients high salt
   intake induces a significant increase in asleep blood pressure with no
   significant changes in 24-h blood pressure, promoting a flattened blood
   pressure curve and tending to transform a dipper into a nondipper
   profile, which could have important implications in end-organ damage.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1993-2006}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical loading on the low back was studied in three different
   current methods of refuse collecting: in polythene bags, two-wheeled
   mini-containers and large four-wheeled containers. To this end the most
   prominent activities of each collecting method were performed in a
   laboratory. On the basis of movement analysis, force measurements and
   biomechanical modelling, spinal compressive and shear forces were
   estimated. From these forces and from the frequency of activities during
   the working day (assessed in a preliminary held study) the low-back
   stress in each collecting method was evaluated. In the bag-method, peak
   forces when throwing the bags ranged from 3341 to 5179 N (average
   compression) and from 284 to 673 N (shear) among the different
   conditions studied. The act of picking up bags also showed rather high
   forces (exceeding the NIOSH limit for disc compression in most cases).
   The frequency of exposure to these forces in the field is rather high
   (workers pick up and throw on average 807 times each day). The
   mini-container method compares favourably to the bags method. Peak
   compressive and shear force in tilting/pushing and pulling
   mini-containers ranged from 1657 to 2654 N and from 123 to 248 N
   respectively. Also, the frequency of stressful events in the field is
   lower in this method. In the large container method extremely high peak
   forces (e.g. compression ranged from 4991 to 5810 N) were observed in
   the task of putting the empty container back from street level to
   sidewalk level (surmounting the kerb). The frequency of activities like
   pushing, pulling and lifting the large container in the field is much
   lower compared with activities in the other methods. On the basis of the
   frequency and magnitude of spinal forces it was concluded that the
   mini-containers should be preferred to the bags. If kerbs are removed at
   container places and tasks are performed by two instead of a single
   person, the large container method would form another good alternative
   to the stressful task of collecting refuse in bags.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of concurrent treatment of experimental acute otitis media
   with ibuprofen and ampicillin was evaluated in chinchillas with respect
   to clearance of the effusion and resolution of mucosal inflammation.
   Sixty-four chinchillas were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae and
   randomly assigned to treatment with either IM ampicillin (control) or
   ampicillin plus ibuprofen (experimental) beginning on day 2 post
   inoculation. On days 3, 6, 9 and 12, 8 animals from each group were
   killed, effusions recovered for biochemical assay and the right middle
   ears prepared for histological study. Between group differences in the
   number of ears with effusion and effusion volume were not statistically
   significant. Mucosal thickness and the frequencies of ears with
   histopathological signs of inflammation were significantly less in the
   experimental group when compared to the control group. Differences in
   the effusion concentrations of total protease, 3 of 4 hydrolytic enzymes
   and free fatty acids favoring the experimental group were observed at
   the 6, 9 and 12 day endpoints. Also, at those times the levels of the 3
   measured products of the cyclooxygenase pathway were less in the
   experimental group. These results suggest that the addition of ibuprofen
   to ampicillin for the treatment of acute otitis media decreases
   production of select eicosonoids, reduces mucosal inflammation and
   alters the course of the disease in this model of bacterial infection.}},

Abstract = {{The activities of a short therapeutic regimen with azithromycin and the

   starting therapy 31 days after challenge, azithromycin (10 days, 50
   mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the infection (2.9 logs, day 48
   post-infection). The effectiveness of doxycycline (21 days, 50 mg/kg/l2
   hourly) was greater than azithromycin (4.1 logs of reduction, day 48
   post-infection), and when doxycycline was administered for a period of
   45 days, all the animals were bacteriologically cured from day 78. The
   combination with streptomycin (14 days, 10 mg/kg/day) did not improve
   the effect of any of the regimens. In an acute model infection,
   treatments with doxycycline or doxycycline-streptomycin, for a period of
   3 days, starting 1 day after lethal challenge, were able to protect all
   the mice. In contrast, only 50\% of the mice treated with azithromycin
   survived the challenge. In conclusion, although a short oral treatment
   with azithromycin was able to reduce the infection significantly, it was
   not able to cure the animals as effectively as the classic regimen with

Abstract = {{Late-onset visual impairment due to cataracts, glaucoma, macular

   progressively worsening vision experience heightened levels of isolation
   and reduced social support, and participate in fewer reinforcing
   recreational activities. This article describes our social skills
   training package for the treatment of depressed, visually impaired,
   older adults. Our treatment focuses on increasing the frequency and
   level of assertiveness with which visually impaired older adults
   interact with each other. In addition to specified treatment methods,
   our empirically derived program employs standardized assessment measures
   to evaluate therapeutic progress. Sessions are implemented to reinforce
   efforts to apply social skills in the environment and reestablish skills

   Measurements of the temperature dependence of Li-7 and H-1 relaxation

   Additional evidence for the increase of the lithium mobility is provided

   hydration also increase the mobility of the free chains and may allow a
   volume expansion of the mobile segments, thus reducing the H-1 second

Abstract = {{Adult Pacific whiting (also known as Pacific hake), Merluccius
   productus, migrate each year from spawning grounds off southern
   California to feeding grounds along the continental shelf break from
   central California to Vancouver Island. During spring and summer, there
   are large-scale commercial fisheries for this species in both U.S. and
   Canadian waters. The stock synthesis model, a flexible, age-structured,
   maximum-likelihood estimation model, was used to investigate the
   migratory behavior of Pacific whiting. In this implementation of the
   stock synthesis model, the U.S. and Canadian zones were defined as
   separate geographic areas, and the parameters of an age-specific
   migration function were estimated. Annual coefficients were estimated
   for the parameter specifying the asymptotic proportion of an age class
   migrating into the Canadian zone for years with coastwide acoustic
   surveys (1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 1989, and 1992). Correlation analysis
   between these coefficients and a suite of environmental variables
   revealed that the March-April water temperature anomaly at a depth of
   100 m from 30 degrees to 42 degrees N lat, had the highest correlations.
   High water temperatures were associated with an increased proportion of
   the Pacific whiting population in the Canadian zone, as occurred during
   the 1982-83 and 1991-92 El Nino events, whereas in 1989, low water
   temperatures were associated with a decreased proportion in the Canadian
   zone. This relationship was used in the stock synthesis model to
   estimate migration curves for years in which no surveys were made. The
   results of the stock synthesis models and the correlation analysis
   suggest that El Nino events promote the northward movement of Pacific
   whiting via intensified northward currents during the period of active
   migration. Although estimates of total population abundance are
   unaffected by modeling the interannual variation in migration, the
   results provide additional information on the transboundary distribution
   of the stock, which is important for forecasting how long-term climate
   change affects the Pacific whiting population.}},

Abstract = {{An in vivo canine model was developed to investigate the histologic and
   biochemical parameters associated with aseptic loosening. Thirty-eight
   canines had cementless total hip arthroplasty. Experimental groups were
   designed specifically to investigate the relative contributions of
   implant motion and particulate debris (cobalt chrome alloy, titanium
   aluminum vanadium, and polyethylene) on the resultant periprosthetic
   tissues. Tissues from a stable, well-ingrown prosthesis provided a
   control. Importantly the histologic and biochemical characteristics of
   the experimentally induced membranes consistently correlated with
   previous in vitro reports of tissues retrieved at revision surgery for
   aseptic loosening. Implant motion and all 3 particulate debris groups
   resulted in increased numbers of macrophages in the periprosthetic
   membranes. The histologic findings paralleled the increase in levels of
   biochemical mediators of bone resorption as measured by collagenase,
   gelatinase, prostaglandin E(2), and interleukin-1 activity. The most
   striking results were seen in the histology and biochemistry of the
   particle groups with highly cellular membranes showing increased
   biochemical activity when compared with controls. The clinical relevance
   of this work lies in the description of an in vivo model of aseptic
   loosening that can be used to investigate the effects of numerous
   variables implicated in aseptic loosening, Ultimately, the model may
   serve as a basis for developing therapeutic interventions.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive model of intense laser light propagation in a fully
   saturable medium is presented. This model employs the Maxwell-Bloch
   equations for a two-level atomic system. Light propagating through a
   medium creates intensity-dependent index of refraction gradients that
   reduce to a Kerr nonlinearity only for a weak field. When the laser
   detuning is positive, self-induced index gradients cause the beam to
   self-focus. Stationary filaments occur when self-focusing exactly
   balances diffraction. There exists a unique set of two-dimensional
   fundamental (and higher mode) solutions for which the filament
   transverse profile (not Gaussian in general) depends on the following
   quantities: density of saturable absorbers, laser detuning from
   resonance, laser power, and natural linewidth. (In contrast the Kerr
   solution does not have a unique filament diameter.) Emphasis will be
   placed on propagation of Gaussian incident beams; deviations from the
   stationary solution in either shape or power generally give rise to
   oscillating spatial patterns, including donutlike profiles, or beam
   breakup.}},

Abstract = {{I present a detailed examination of Fokker-Planck models for the
   globular cluster NGC 6397. I show that these models provide a good match
   to observations of the surface density profile, mass functions at three
   radii, and the velocity dispersion profile. The constraint of requiring
   the best matches to the mass functions and surface density profiles to
   occur simultaneously defines a surface in an initial parameter space
   consisting of the cluster concentration, mass, and limiting radius. I
   discuss various techniques for locating this surface and the dependence
   of the quality of the matches on the position of the model on the
   surface, the initial mass function, and the retention rate of neutron
   stars. The quality of the matches is usually strongly related to the age
   of the models, but one initial mass function was found for which the
   quality of the matches is independent of age. The models give an
   estimate for the current cluster mass of 6.6 +/- 0.5 x 10(4)M,.
   Variations in the model matches with different initial mass functions
   suggest that more than 1400 M. is in neutron stars and that less than
   one-third of the mass is in stars less massive than 0.2 M.. This mass
   gives a V-band mass-to-light ratio of 1.2 in solar units. The models and
   data provide weaker estimates of the structural parameters but suggest
   that the core radius is less than 11'' (0.3 pc) and the tidal radius is
   10 +/- 2'(17 +/- 4 pc). In turn, by assuming a flat rotation curve for
   the Galaxy, the mass and tidal radius suggest that the latter was set at
   a distance of 2.5 kpc from the Galactic center.}},

Abstract = {{A two-part study was undertaken to investigate the effects of movement
   experiences on lower extremity function during impact activities. Group
   and single-subject performances were evaluated for a total of 12 male
   volunteers during landing (Study I) and running (Study II) activities.
   Standard biomechanical techniques were used to obtain kinematic (200 Hz)
   and kinetic (1000 Hz) data during soft, normal and stiff-knee landings
   (Study I) and for under, normal, and over-stride running (Study II).
   Performance trials were tested for normality, condition differences were
   documented and multiple regression models were computed to predict the
   first (F1) and second (F2) maximum vertical forces during landing and
   the maximum impact force (IF) during running. Results of the study
   identified condition differences with no deviations from normality,
   thereby achieving the goal of increasing performance heterogeneity to
   benefit the modeling procedures. Group regression model results for F1,
   F2 and IF each identified a single predictor variable that accounted for
   74.7, 98.6 and 81.6\% explained variance (EV), respectively.
   Single-subject predictors and EV values varied and demonstrated a number
   of different strategies. The group models were not representative of any
   of the individual subjects' performances and indicate that group models
   can describe a mythical `'average'' performer. These results suggest

   investigations of the stability of peroxide protecting groups to the use
   of peroxides as mediators of C-C bond-forming reactions. The stability
   of monoperoxyketals towards olefinations and organometallic additions
   allows a new approach to peroxide synthesis based upon formation of C-C
   or C=C bonds in the presence of protected hydroperoxides, a strategy
   which has been successfully applied to the synthesis of the unstable
   eicosanoids 15(S)-HPETE and 5(S)-HPETE. Peroxyketals are also capable of
   mediating C-C bond formation; ionization of peroxyketals in the presence
   of Lewis acids produces peroxycarbenium ion intermediates able to
   undergo both inter- and intramolecular trapping with electron-rich
   alkenes. The lack of enantioselective approaches to peroxide-containing
   synthons continues to impose a serious constraint on our approaches to
   peroxide natural products and the account closes with a discussion of
   new methods for asymmetric chemical peroxidation.}},

Abstract = {{Can humans recover metric structure from motion sequences or, as has
   been claimed by Todd and Bressan {[}(1990) Perception \& Psychophysics,
   48, 419-430], are they limited to recovering only relief structure? Two
   experiments were carried out to investigate this question. In a
   metric-structure task, the angular thresholds for discriminating two
   rotating bi-planar structures were approximate to 91 deg. By contrast,
   in a relief-structure task, the angular thresholds for discriminating a
   planar from a non-planar structure, both undergoing simple rotational
   motion, were only approximate to 11 deg. A computational model is
   proposed to examine the image motion sensitivity required to perform
   discriminations of both three-dimensional metric and relief structure
   from motion. When the experimental data were re-plotted in terms of this
   two-dimensional sensitivity, the thresholds were found to be the same
   for both tasks. This finding is related to the model's revelation that
   recovering metric structure from motion is inherently more
   noise-sensitive than is recovering relief structure from motion. The
   conclusion is that the differences in angular thresholds reflect the
   differing nature of the two tasks. There is no evidence that the visual
   processes themselves are preferentially sensitive to non-metric over
   metric structure from motion.}},

Abstract = {{Results from a fourth season (1993/94) of monitoring the Trapezium
   cluster in the Cousins I band at Van Vleck Observatory are reported.
   Data were obtained on 28 nights with multiple exposures on most. A
   periodogram technique described by Horne \& Baliunas {[}ApJ, 302, 757
   (1986)] based on Scargle's method was used to search for periods. False
   alarm probabilities must be carefully assessed when the sampling
   intervals are distributed in the manner of this study. Multiple
   observations per night allow us to effectively resolve problems with
   aliasing. Rotation periods are now known for 19 cluster members; ten are
   confirmations of periods reported by Mandel \& Herbst {[}ApJ, 383, L75
   (1991)] and/or Attridge \& Herbst {[}ApJ, 398, L61 (1992)] and nine are
   newly discovered. 17 of these are likely Type I (cool spot) variables
   and two are of Type IIp (hot spot). Periods range from 1.68 to 34.5 d
   and have a bimodal distribution similar to that found for the Orion
   Nebula cluster as whole. In this limited, but homogeneous sample, we
   find no trends in angular velocity with stellar mass, stellar age, or
   presence on an inner disk, as inferred from H-K excess. The existence of
   a bimodal period distribution is, however, strong evidence in favor of
   disk-regulated angular momentum evolution. Irregular variables are also
   common in the Trapezium cluster and we identify 14 that have ranges
   exceeding 0.5 mag. Most of them exhibit light curves typical of
   classical T Tauri stars (Type II), but one has a much slower (perhaps
   FUor-like?) behavior, and three showed eclipse-like drops in brightness.
   They could be eclipsing binaries but no periods were found, so they are
   more likely to be Type III irregular variables (UXors). VIJHK photometry
   demonstrates that the large amplitude variables (LAVs), as a group, have
   substantial IR excesses, indicative of accretion disks, signifying that
   they are indeed CTTS. None of these stars are brighter than V = 14, in
   accord with the failure of spectroscopic surveys to detect CTTS in the
   Trapezium cluster, heretofore. Our data indicate that both CTTS and WTTS
   are present in the Trapezium cluster, but that the brightest WTTS are
   systematically brighter than the brightest CTTS by about 1.6 mag in V
   and 1.8 mag in I. A simple interpretation of this fact is that the CTTS
   (at least the LAVs) are of lower mass and cooler than the WTTS in this
   cluster. (C) 1995 American Astronomical Society.}},

Abstract = {{The embrittlement of papers, manufactured through processes introduced
   in the mid-19th century, has caused many millions of books to become
   fragile, even to the point of being unusable. During the 1980s the
   British Library funded a research programme, carried out at the
   University of Surrey, to develop a technology which could be used to
   treat brittle books on a large scale, with the goal of greatly extending
   their useful life. The process developed, known as graft
   co-polymerization, involves three stages:
   i) application of a cocktail of monomers to the book's pages;
   ii) equilibration of these monomers throughout the text block;
   iii) a low, slow dose of gamma-radiation to effect polymerization.
   The work at the University of Surrey studied various combinations of
   monomers, as well as equilibration times and dose regimes; it also
   examined the environment necessary to achieve polymerization within the
   pages of the book, whilst leaving it in an otherwise original condition.
   In collaboration with the British Library, Nordion International has
   designed a full-scale book-strengthening plant capable of processing
   between 200,000 and 500,000 books per year, with estimated prices to
   customers in the region of pound 8-pound 10 per volume (US \$12-16). In
   order to test the equipment and procedures that would be involved in
   such a plant, pilot-scale equipment has been designed and assembled on
   the premises of Isotron pie, where use is made of a conventional
   irradiator. This paper gives details of the graft co-polymerization
   process, and some results of the pilot-scale work, in terms of both
   efficacy and controllability. It also discusses the technical and
   economic feasibility of building and running a full-scale plant.}},

   At McDonnell Douglas Aerospace (MDA), the need for very reliable RCS

   curved-surface-based high-frequency code. This code, called CADDSCAT
   (Computer-Aided-Design Drafting SCATtering), has matured to a high level

   MDA in advanced design since 1987. CADDSCAT was adopted as a basis code,
   in 1992, by the Navy-sponsored Conceptual Aircraft Design Working Group
   (CADWG). This multi-service group includes the Naval Air Warfare
   Center-Aircraft Division, Warminster, PA; the Naval Maritime
   Intelligence Center; the Naval Research Laboratories; and the US Army at

Abstract = {{We report numerical results for the single-hole properties in the t-J
   model and the strong-coupling approximation to the Hubbard model in two
   dimensions. Using the hopping basis with over 10(6) states we discuss
   (for an infinite system) the bandwidth, the leading Fourier coefficients
   in the dispersion, the band masses, and the spin-spin correlations near
   the hole. We compare our results with those obtained by other methods.
   The band minimum is found to be at (pi/2, pi/2) for the t-J model for
   0.1 less than or equal to t/J less than or equal to 10, and for the
   strong-coupling model for 1 less than or equal to t/J less than or equal
   to 10. The bandwidth in both models is approximately 2J at large t/J, in
   rough agreement with loop-expansion results but in disagreement with
   other results. The strong-coupling bandwidth for t/J greater than or
   similar to, 6 can be obtained from the t-J model by treating the
   three-site terms in first-order perturbation theory. The dispersion
   along the magnetic zone face is flat, giving a large
   parallel/perpendicular band mass ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac musculature of the cranial vena cava in the common tree shrew
   (Tupaia glis) was examined by light and transmission electron
   microscopy. The common tree shrew has well developed cardiac myocyte
   layers in the tunica media of the cranial vena cava, extending from the
   right atrium to the root of the subclavian vein. Because the common tree
   shrew belongs to a primitive group of mammals, the occurrence of cardiac
   musculature in the cranial vena cava may be a common feature in lower
   mammals. The development of this musculature indicates that active
   contraction of the cranial vena cava wall occurs in this species.
   Electron micrographs showed the typical ultrastructure of myocytes and
   nerve endings. These observations suggest that this musculature may
   serve as a regulatory pump for the return of venous blood to the right
   atrium and as a blood reservoir system under conditions of rapid heart
   rate. Additionally, the presence of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP)
   was also demonstrated in the myocytes of the vena cava
   immunohistochemically. These findings show that the cardiac endocrine
   organ for ANP develops even in the principal veins including the cranial
   vena cava.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that increases in pressure in the abdomen
   (P-ab) exerted by CO2 insufflation during laparoscopy would increase
   elastance (E) and resistance (R) of both the lungs and chest wall. We
   measured airway flow and airway and esophageal pressures of 12
   anesthetized/paralyzed tracheally intubated patients during mechanical
   ventilation at 10-30/min and tidal volume of 250-800 mL. From these
   measurements, we used discrete Fourier transformation to calculate E and
   R of the lungs and chest wall. Measurements were made at 0, 15, and 25
   mm Hg P-ab in the 15 degrees head-down (Trendelenburg) posture and at 0
   and 15 mm Hg P-ab in the 10 degrees head-up (reverse Trendelenburg)
   posture. Lung and chest wall Es and Rs while head-down increased at P-ab
   = 15 mm Hg, and both Es increased further at P(a)b = 25 mm Hg (P <
   0.05). Both Es and Rs also increased while head-up at P-ab = 15 mm Hg (P
   < 0.05), but increases in lung E and R were less than while head-down (P
   < 0.05). The increases in lung E and R at P-ab = 15 mm Hg in either
   posture were positively correlated to body weight or body mass index,
   whereas the increases in chest wall E and R were negatively correlated
   to the same factors (P < 0.05). Lung and chest wall mechanical
   impedances increase with increasing P-ab; the increases depend on body
   configuration and are greater while head-down. These changes should be
   considered in patients where increases in impedance may be critical,
   such as in obese patients and those with pulmonary disease.}},

Abstract = {{Genotype and allele frequencies of the DYS19, D12S67, and D1S80 highly
   polymorphic loci were determined in population samples from southern
   Italy (103 subjects) and Greece (84 subjects) using the amplified
   fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique (polymerase chain reaction
   followed by native PAGE and silver staining). Five, eleven, and eighteen
   alleles were found at the DYS19, D12S67, and D1S80 loci, respectively.
   PIC values ranged from 0.55 (DYS19 locus in Italians) to 0.79 (D12S67
   locus in Italians). The distribution of D12S67 and D1S80 genotypes
   conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, as confirmed by three
   statistics. Heterogeneity G tests, carried out on allele frequency
   distributions, showed a significant difference between the samples at
   the DYS19 locus, whereas no difference was found with regard to the
   other polymorphisms. Using data from the literature, we widened the
   comparison to other European groups analyzed for the same markers. All
   the polymorphisms were found to distinguish between populations of the
   same main ethnic group. In particular, D1S80 allele frequencies
   distinguished the Finns from other European groups (Spanish, German,
   Italian, and Greek samples). The reduced assay time, the high
   polymorphism level, and the ability to distinguish between populations
   indicate that these markers have potential value in population genetic
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{The blue-green alga Anacystis nidulans Drouet (Synechococcus
   leopoliensis Raciborski) cultivated under phosphate-limited conditions
   adopts a threshold value in the nanomolar range below which uptake
   ceases. In this study, we investigated the influence of phosphate pulses
   on the regulation of uptake behavior during reestablishment of the
   threshold value. Short-term pulses had only a slight effect on uptake
   kinetics and, hence, on the threshold value, even if the population had
   been exposed several times to elevated concentrations above the
   steady-state level in the growth medium. The threshold value was also
   practically insensitive to the amount of phosphate stored during these
   short-term fluctuations. Long-term phosphate pulses resulted in a
   transition to a metastable state that was characterized by a severalfold
   higher threshold value. This transition, apparently an adaptation to the
   transiently elevated phosphate concentrations, was further studied by
   following the influx of P-32-phosphate at constant external
   concentrations and was shown to be complete after a period of 10-20 min.
   After adaptation to pulses, the uptake behavior followed a linear
   flow-force relation over a wide range of external concentrations. This
   behavior was explained by the simultaneous operation of at least two
   uptake systems with different, but coordinated kinetic parameters. This
   linear flow-force relation facilitated a direct determination of the
   threshold value from uptake measurements. For applicability in the field
   the force-flow relation can be a diagnostic tool to assay for
   fluctuating phosphate and to establish threshold values below the normal
   measurable range.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction between lymphocytes and epithelial cells may play a key role
   in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-associated gastric mucosal
   inflammation. This interaction process is at least partially mediated by
   various cell adhesion molecules. The aims of the present study were to
   assess using flow cytometric analysis whether H. pylori directly or
   supernatants from H. pylori-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells
   (PBMC) can affect the expression of adhesion molecules on the gastric
   epithelial cell line AGS in vitro. The results showed that resting AGS
   cells expressed CD44 and ICAM-1. Go-culture of AGS with H. pylori or
   cytokine-rich supernatants from H. pylori-activated PBMC resulted in
   upregulation of expression of CD44 and ICAM-1 on AGS cells. These data
   suggest that H, pylori directly and indirectly through inflammatory
   cytokines may contribute to alternations in adhesion molecule expression
   on gastric epithelial cells. This may be of pathological significance in
   H. pylori associated gastric mucosal inflammation and carcinogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of a part-through crack with arbitrary loads
   on the crack faces is considered. By introducing the solution of the
   weight function for a two-dimensional edge crack, combined with the line
   spring model, the extra loads on crack faces can be represented as two
   equivalent quantities in terms of two-dimensional stress intensity
   factors. The problem for a cylindrical shell containing an axial inner
   surface crack subjected to stress gradients can then be reduced to two
   integral equations. The model is used to compute the stress intensity
   factors for four stress distributions-uniform, linear, quadratic and
   cubic-and the results give very good agreement with those obtained by
   the finite element method. The numerical results of the calculations for
   axial inner surface crack initiation in the shell subjected to thermal
   shock are also presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of uterine leiomyoma on infertility is subject to
   controversy. Two main mechanisms associating leiomyomata and infertility
   have been suggested: the obstruction of gamete transport and impaired
   implantation. In-vitro fertilization (IVF) is a unique setting for
   examining the effect of leiomyomata on the implantation rate. This study
   was designed to determine the impact of uterine leiomyomata on the
   results of IVF. In a retrospective analysis of IVF cycles, 46 women with
   documented uterine leiomyoma were compared with a control group with
   mechanical infertility. The implantation rate and pregnancy outcome in
   relation to the leiomyoma were observed. Implantation (22.1\%/transfer,
   6.8\%/embryo) and abortion rates (36\%) in the study group were similar
   to the results in the control group with pure mechanical factor. An
   analysis of IVF results according to the hysteroscopic pretreatment
   findings revealed that impaired implantation is associated with
   leiomyoma only where uterine intracavitary abnormalities co-exist. We
   conclude that implantation rate and pregnancy outcome are impaired in
   women with uterine leiomyomata only when they cause deformation of the
   uterine cavity. In patients with leiomyomata associated with an abnormal
   uterine cavity, surgical treatment should be considered prior to IVF
   because of the reduced implantation rate.}},

   BW, FI, and EP. In Experiment 2, intact or ground (G) V were either
   soaked (S) in water (1:5) for 24 h or autoclaved (A) at 103.5 x 10(3) Pa

   corn soybean (control) and seven others, each containing 25\% V,
   previously subjected to the forementioned treatments as follows:
   untreated V (UV), SDV, GSDV, ADV, GADV, SADV, and GSADV. Compared with

Abstract = {{Introduction: Newborn screening for phenylketonuria (PKU) and congenital
   hypothyroidism (CH) is usually conducted with a single specimen
   collected from the infant prior to hospital discharge. To meet the
   specific medical infrastructural requirements in the Principado de
   Asturias in northern Spain, we modified specimen collection by obtaining
   an umbilical cord blood specimen for CH screening and a newborn blood
   specimen for PKU screening from each infant. Methods: The umbilical cord
   blood specimen is collected on filter paper and at hospital discharge is
   given to the parent together with a kit for collection of the newborn
   blood specimen, The latter specimen is collected at age 5-8 days at a
   Public Health Center and mailed with the umbilical cord specimen to the
   screening laboratory. CH screening is performed by TSH assay and PKU
   screening by phenylalanine assay, which was initially performed by
   thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and now by fluorometric technique.
   Confirmatory CH testing was conducted in the newborn blood specimen by
   radioimmunoassay for thyroxine (T4), Results: Among 91 529 neonates
   tested for CH, 27 cases were detected, a frequency of 1:3,400. Females
   accounted for 82\% of the cases. Among 75 488 tested for PKU, five cases
   (1:15 000) were detected, Discussion: Utilization of both umbilical cord
   blood and neonatal blood specimens has accommodated the health care
   organization of our region and allowed for comprehensive screening for
   CH and PKU. This strategy could be a model for other areas of the world
   with infrastructural conditions similar to those we have had to

Abstract = {{This paper describes rapidly converging algorithms for computing
   attenuation maps from Poisson transmission measurements using
   penalized-likelihood objective functions. We demonstrate that an
   under-relaxed cyclic coordinate-ascent algorithm converges faster than
   the convex algorithm of Lange {[}1], which in turn converges faster than
   the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for transmission tomography
   {[}1], To further reduce computation, one could replace the
   log-likelihood objective with a quadratic approximation, However, we
   show with simulations and analysis that the quadratic objective function
   leads to biased estimates for low-count measurements, Therefore we
   introduce hybrid Poisson/polynomial objective functions that use the
   exact Poisson log-likelihood for detector measurements with low counts,
   but use computationally efficient quadratic or cubic approximations for
   the high-count detector measurements. We demonstrate that the hybrid
   objective functions reduce computation time without increasing
   estimation bias.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of steroid receptors has been investigated in an attempt
   to clarify the role of steroid hormones in the proliferation and
   progression of acoustic neuromas. Specimens of tumours taken during
   translabyrinthine surgery were tested for cytosolic (c) and nuclear (n)
   steroid receptors. Oestrogen and progesterone receptor levels were
   evaluated by enzymatic immune-assay, while androgen receptor binding
   levels were detected by dextran-coated charcoal method in a single-step
   determination. In some cases, the six point Scatchard analysis of
   cytosolic and nuclear androgen receptor was also performed. Threshold
   values were: 3 fmol/mg of proteins for cytosolic steroid receptors and
   20 fmol/mg DNA for nuclear steroids, which corresponded to approximate
   median values of cytosolic and nuclear oestrogen and progesterone,
   respectively. Oestrogen and progesterone appeared to be localized more
   frequently in the nuclei rather than in the cytosol (70\% oestrogen and
   progesterone positivity in the nuclei; 30\% oestrogen, 40\% progesterone
   positivity in the cytosol), while androgen receptors were preferentially
   localized in the cytosol(80\% positivity in the cytosol; 40\% positivity
   in the nuclei). A negative non-linear correlation between cytosolic
   oestrogen and cytosolic androgen receptors was found. There was a direct
   linear correlation between cytosolic oestrogen and nuclear oestrogen
   levels. A strict correlation between nuclear oestrogen and nuclear
   progesterone incidence was shown. Preliminary analysis of clinical data
   and biochemical parameters showed that cytosolic progesterone levels
   inversely correlated with tumour size.}},

Abstract = {{The biomass and frequency of occurrence of aquatic macrophytes observed
   during 1975 and 1991 in Navigation Pool No. 8 of the upper Mississippi
   River were compared. Samples were collected from contiguous backwater,
   isolated backwater and impounded habitat types. Overall declines were
   observed in both frequency and biomass between the two years. Changes in
   depth, water clarity and bed sediment texture were also observed. About
   50\% of the samples collected in 1991 had no vegetation, compared with
   20\% in 1975. The greatest reduction in frequency occurred among
   submergent taxa (77\% in 1975 to 31\% in 1991), whereas only slight
   declines were observed for emergent taxa. However, the mean biomass of
   both lifeforms decreased substantially (48 to 1 g/m(2) for submergent
   and 61 to 27 g/m(2) for emergent lifeforms). The mean total biomass
   declined from 114 g/m(2) in 1975 to 35 g/m(2) in 1991. Declines were
   most evident in the impounded habitat, where the frequency of occurrence
   of submergent taxa decreased from 83\% in 1975 to 11\% in 1991, and mean
   biomass decreased from 90 to 1 g/m(2). Similar but less extensive
   reductions in frequency and biomass of submergent taxa were observed in
   the contiguous backwater habitat. In contrast, both the frequency and
   biomass of floating-leaved macrophytes increased slightly in contiguous
   backwater habitats. Changes in frequency and biomass of macrophytes in
   isolated backwater habitats were neligible between 1975 and 1991. It is
   hypothesized that changes in the macrophyte community structure may be
   related to physical changes associated with 57 years of impoundment.}},

Abstract = {{Bovine eggs exhibit repetitive rises in intracellular calcium
   concentration ({[}Ca2+](i)) in response to fertilization. The signaling
   pathways and Ca-2 release mechanisms involved in their generation are
   not well characterized. This study examined the presence of a
   GTP-binding protein (G-protein) signaling pathway as well as the role of
   inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3R) receptor (InsP3R)-mediated Ca2+
   release and ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated Ca2+ release, the two Ca2+
   receptors/channels most often thought to participate in the generation
   of {[}Ca2+](i) oscillations, by injecting appropriate agonists and
   antagonists and monitoring their effects on Ca2+ release and pronucleus
   formation. Injection of guanosine 5'-0-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP
   gamma{[}S]), which promotes G-protein-mediated phosphoinositide
   turnover, induced, at high concentrations, repetitive {[}Ca2+](i) rises.
   Low concentrations of GTP gamma{[}S] were ineffective. Injection of
   inositol trisphosphorothioate (lnsP3S3),a nonmetabolizable analogue of
   InsP3, evoked an immediate Ca2+ release followed by {[}Ca2+](i)
   oscillations. The GTP gamma{[}S]- and InsP3S3-induced oscillations
   showed a rapid attenuation in amplitude and were terminated in about
   30-60 min. Thimerosal, a thiol oxidizing agent, caused repetitive rises
   in {[}Ca2+](i) by sensitizing Ca2+ injection-induced Ca2+ release.
   Injection of ryanodine, which stimulates Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release via
   the RyR, did not induce {[}Ca2+](i) oscillations; and eggs into which it
   was preinjected exhibited normal {[}Ca2+](i) oscillations in response to
   thimerosal. Preinjection of heparin, a competitive InsP3R antagonist,
   blocked in a dose-dependent manner the Ca2+ response to InsP3 and
   thimerosal, and its injection into fertilized oscillating eggs inhibited
   {[}Ca2+](i) oscillations in all eggs. Heparin also inhibited pronucleus
   formation after insemination. Preinjection of guanosine
   5'-0-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta{[}S]), a G-protein antagonist, had
   similar effects. Together, these results suggest that the
   InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ release mechanism plays an important role in the
   generation of fertilization-associated {[}Ca2+](i) oscillations and egg
   activation in bovine eggs. The data also suggest the participation of a
   G-protein pathway during fertilization.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal expression of seven Drosophila protein tyrosine
   phosphatase genes during oogenesis was examined by whole mount in-situ
   hybridization of antisense RNA probes to ovaries. Our observations
   indicate diverse expression patterns consistent with multiple roles for
   protein tyrosine phosphatases in the ovary. DPTP99A and corkscrew
   transcripts are expressed in follicle cells, consistent with possible
   roles in the EGF receptor signaling pathway. Transcripts from corkscrew
   and DPTP10D are detected in the germline during oogenesis and localized
   to the oocyte during egg chamber development. Localization of the two
   transcripts is disrupted by mutations in egalitarian and Bicaudal D.
   DLAR and DPTP4E transcripts are found in the germline during the same
   developmental stages as DPTP10D transcripts, but their transcripts are
   not localized to the oocyte. DPTP61F transcription is detected only
   after stage 6 of oogenesis. After stage 10B these transcripts are
   transported to the oocyte; thus ovarian transcription of DPTP61F may
   reflect a maternal contribution of the mRNA for later use during
   embryogenesis. DPTP69D transcripts are sequestered in the nucleus from
   stage 7 to stage 10, and then released to the cytoplasm. Our
   observations suggest that the export of DPTP69D mRNA from the nucleus is
   temporally regulated during oogenesis.}},

   plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and the levels of very low density
   lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), and low

   lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased significantly, Treatment caused
   also an increase in the protein content of IDL, a decrease in the
   triglyceride content of LDL, and an increase in the size of LDL as
   assessed by gradient gel electrophoresis. Concentrations of

   the mass concentration of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (P < 0.05).
   Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the triglyceride

Abstract = {{Vascular dementia is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly
   after Alzheimer's disease. Many forms of vascular dementia have been
   described: multi-infarct dementia, lacunar dementia, Binswanger's
   subcortical encephalopathy, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, white matter
   lesions associated with dementias, single infarct dementia, dementia
   linked to hypoperfusion and haemorrhagic dementia. The difficulty of
   diagnosing vascular dementia must not be underestimated and an
   international consensus is needed for epidemiological studies. The
   NINCDS-AIREN group has recently published diagnostic criteria. The State
   of California Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers also
   proposed some which differ from the NINCDS-AIREN criteria in considering
   only ischaemic vascular dementia and not other mechanisms such as
   haemorrhagic or hypoxic lesions. Most studies stress hypertension as the
   most powerful risk factor for all forms of vascular dementia. The
   incidence rate ranges from 7 per 1000 person-years in normal volunteers
   to 16 per 1000 person-years in hypertensive patients. No therapeutic
   attempt has influenced the course of the disease once the dementing
   condition is established. The only effective approach is preventive
   treatment. The objective of the SYST-EUR Vascular Dementia project is to
   confirm that the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension is able to
   reduce its incidence.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of soluble carbohydrates in vegetative parts of sweet
   sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.) represents an intermediate
   reserve pool for grain filling as well as an irreversible storage up to
   maturity. In order to study the effect of sterility on soluble sugar
   accumulation in vegetative parts, two cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS)
   lines of sweet sorghum were compared with their corresponding fertile
   maintainers for non-structural carbohydrate concentrations in shoots.
   Plants were harvested at four different physiological stages. The lines
   showed significant differences in the yield of non-structural
   carbohydrates. At maturity, the yields of soluble carbohydrates from
   vegetative parts of the two sterile lines were 93 \% and 43 \% higher
   than the yield of the two corresponding fertile lines. Ar that stage,
   sucrose represented about 80 \% of total soluble carbohydrates and the
   higher yield of soluble carbohydrates of sterile lines was mainly due to
   the higher yield of sucrose. This indicates that the yield of
   extractable carbohydrates, especially sucrose, in vegetative parts of
   sweet sorghum could be considerably improved by using sterile lines
   which are utilized in hybrid production.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates in the
   tracheo-bronchial tree of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
   Examination of the soluble phase of sputa from 17 CF patients revealed
   the presence of high levels of NO2-/NO3- assayed by the Greiss reaction.
   We also examined the presence of the chemotactic cytokine interleukin-8
   (IL-8) in these samples so as to assess another important inflammatory
   marker; high levels of IL-8 were present in the sputa of cystic fibrosis
   subjects. The elevated nitrite was not produced by the presence of
   Pseudomonos bacteria in the sputa, inasmuch as bacteria in culture
   released undetectable amounts of nitrite in culture media. Neutrophils
   from the sputa of CF patients with disease exacerbation released higher
   amounts of nitrite and IL-8. Neutrophils from the sputa were also shown
   to spontaneously release substantial amounts of nitrite in the
   supernatants, and this release was partly blocked by the antagonist
   N-G-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). Blood neutrophils were shown to
   release nitrite only in response to challenge with CF-associated strains
   of Pseudomonas, and not exposure to cytokines. There was no significant
   differences in nitrite release between normal and CF blood
   polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs). A study of upper airway epithelial
   cell lines showed that these cells released low amounts of nitrite after
   infection with CF-associated strains of Pseudomonas but not after
   cytokine exposure. Epithelial cell lines with CF or normal phenotypes
   were shown to release similar quantities of nitrite, upon stimulation
   with Pseudomonas. These data demonstrate that elevated levels of
   reactive nitrogen intermediates and IL-8 are produced in the
   tracheo-bronchial tree of subjects with CF. Levels of IL-8 and nitrite
   were higher in the secretions of CF subjects with disease exacerbation.
   The involvement of nitric oxide and other reactive nitrogen
   intermediates produced by neutrophils and other cells in the tissue
   damaging processes in CF deserves further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The susceptibility of the majority of the existing building stock to
   structural damage largely depends on the quality of design, detailing
   and construction. In many cases, the engineer can extend the life span
   of a building structure by utilizing simple repair/strengthening
   techniques. The choice of the repair/strengthening technique becomes,
   therefore, the decisive factor, since high cost would deter many
   building owners from executing essential repair works. In this paper, a
   cost-effective and efficient technique for strengthening RC columns is
   described. The proposed technique involves post-tensioning metal strips
   around reinforced concrete columns, by using a strapping machine. The
   preliminary results of the experimental work carried out at Sheffield
   University indicate that such strengthening can increase member strength
   and ductility to higher levels than those possible by conventional
   reinforcement, at only a fraction of the time and cost required by
   alternative techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic forcing is introduced into the Lorenz; model to study the
   effects of time-dependent forcing on the behavior of the system. Such a
   nonautonomous system stays dissipative and has a bounded attracting set
   which all trajectories finally enter. The possible kinds of attracting
   sets are restricted to periodic orbits and strange attractors. A
   large-scale survey of parameter space shows that periodic forcing has
   mainly three effects in the Lorenz system depending on the forcing
   frequency: (i) Fixed points are replaced by oscillations around them;
   (ii) resonant periodic orbits are created both in the stable and the
   chaotic region; (iii) chaos is created in the stable region near the
   resonance frequency and in periodic windows. A comparison to other
   studies shows that part of this behavior has been observed in
   simulations of higher truncations and real world experiments. Since very
   small modulations can already have a considerable effect, this suggests
   that periodic processes such as annual or diurnal cycles should not be
   omitted even in simple climate models.}},

   Initial CRP concentrations differed significantly between patients with

   patients versus 3 of 14 asthma patients (P < 0.02). In CF patients, CRP
   concentrations did not correlate with PFTs (except on day 0) or clinical

Abstract = {{The computational effort in the calculation of Wilson fermion quark
   propagators in Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics can be considerably
   reduced by exploiting the Wilson fermion matrix structure in inversion
   algorithms based on the non-symmetric Lanczos process. We consider two
   such methods: QMR (quasi minimal residual) and BCG (biconjugate
   gradients).
   Based on the decomposition M/kappa = 1/kappa-D of the Wilson mass
   matrix, using QMR, one can carry out inversions on a whole trajectory of
   masses simultaneously, merely at the computational expense of a single
   propagator computation. In other words, one has to compute the
   propagator corresponding to the lightest mass only, while all the
   heavier masses are given for free, at the price of extra storage.
   Moreover, the symmetry gamma 5 M = M(+) gamma 5 can be used to cut the
   computational effort in QMR and BCG by a factor of two. We show that
   both methods then become - in the critical regime of small quark masses
   - competitive to BiCGStab and significantly better than the standard MR
   method, with optimal relaxation factor, and CG as applied to the normal
   equations.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that spontaneous and stimulated growth hormone
   (GH) secretion is diminished in human obesity. In contrast to classic GH
   deficiency, obesity is not associated with hypopituitary levels of
   circulating total (extractable) insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and
   reduced somatic growth. Thus, the riddle of `'normal growth without GH''
   in obese children and the mechanisms behind the GH suppression have
   remained unsolved. Insulin reduces hepatic production of IGF-binding
   protein-1 (IGFBP-1), an in vitro inhibitor of IGF bioactivity, and it
   has been suggested that the obesity-related hyperinsulinemia may
   increase free (bioactive) IGF in vivo by reducing the concentration of
   IGFBP-1. We have recently developed a method that during near in vivo
   conditions isolates the free, unbound fractions of IGF-I and IGF-II in
   human serum. Using this method, we have determined overnight fasting
   serum levels of free IGFs in obese subjects and compared the results
   with levels of total (extractable) IGFs, IGFBPs, GH, and insulin. The
   study included 92 healthy subjects (56 males and 36 females) allocated
   to three age-matched groups depending on body mass index (BMI): 31
   controls (BMI less than or equal to 25), 33 subjects with moderate
   obesity (25 < BMI < 30), and 28 subjects with severe obesity (BMI
   greater than or equal to 30). Fasting serum insulin correlated
   positively (r = .61, P < .0001) with BMI and was significantly elevated
   in moderate and severe obesity (P < .05). In contrast, levels of serum
   GH and IGFBP-1 were suppressed in both obese groups (P < .05), and the
   latter inversely correlated (r = -.60, P < .001) with BMI. Serum free
   IGF-I was 470 +/- 50 ng/L (mean +/- SEM) in controls, and was elevated
   in moderate obesity by 47\% (690 +/- 90 ng/L, P < .05) and in severe
   obesity by 72\% (810 +/- 90 ng/L, P < .05), whereas levels of total
   IGF-I were unaltered. In addition, serum free IGF-I was inversely
   correlated with IGFBP-1 (r = -.47, P < .001). Serum IGFBP-3 and total
   IGF-II were both increased (P < .05) in obese subjects, whereas serum
   free IGF-II was unaltered. All phenomena were more pronounced in males
   than in females. We conclude that in obesity, the concentration of free
   IGF-I in fasting serum is increased. This is likely a result of
   decreased circulating IGFBP-1, again caused by hyperinsulinemia.
   Elevated serum free IGF-I may, by feedback, explain the low levels of GH
   and may be responsible for the normal growth without GH in obese
   children. Increased levels of IGFBP-3 and normal levels of serum total
   IGF-I support the interpretation that obese subjects are hypersensitive
   to the actions of GH. Copyright (C) 1995 by W.B. Saunders Company.}},

Abstract = {{The authors are part of a committee that has been designing a new high
   school curriculum in computer science and supervising the preparation of
   a comprehensive study program based on it. The new program emphasizes
   the foundations of algorithmic thinking and teaches programming as a way
   to get the computer to carry out an algorithm. The authors discuss the
   program and its initial implementation.
   They begin by discussing the key underlying principles that have guided
   their work. Then they describe the structure and content of the program,
   including a 3-unit version of 270 hours and a 5-unit version of 450. The
   curriculum is divided into five modules: Fundamentals 1 and 2, Software
   Design, Second Paradigm, Applications, and Theory. The authors describe
   each module in detail.
   Next, the authors explain the steps the committee has been taking to get
   the program underway. They reveal some challenges they have faced in
   developing the course material. For example, the Fundamentals 1 module
   had to provide a solid foundation for students who would not study
   computer science beyond the 10th grade as well as for those who would
   complete either the 3- or 5-unit program.
   This program is being tested in Israeli schools. One of the main
   challenges the committee has faced is a way to provide adequate teacher
   training.}},

   to consider biotic potentialities of Encarsia formosa born from black
   pupae stored at low temperature. In spite of good rates of hatching,
   black pupae stored for 15 and 20 days at 9 degrees C exhibited a
   reduction in the insects' biotic potentialities (daily fecundity and
   longevity). The addition of sugar providing energy during the hatching
   of the parasite palliates the injurious effect of the cold but the
   length of storage is still limited. The study shows that, on the one
   hand, minor variations in biotic potentialities exist due to differences
   in, for example, photoperiod, but that on the other hand, the stress due

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Ischemia and reperfusion of the liver are associated with
   changes in the interaction of leukocyte-endothelium cells, The role of
   an adhesion molecule, P-selectin, is studied in ischemia and reperfusion
   injury of the liver.
   STUDY DESIGN: Total hepatic ischemia was produced in the rat for 90
   minutes, using a portosystemic shunt. To determine the role of
   P-selectin in ischemia and reperfusion, a murine IgG(1) monodonal
   antibody to P-selectin (1 mg/kg) was used at different times (30 minutes
   before and at reperfusion and five minutes and 24 hours after
   reperfusion). Rats survived for seven days, and tests showing hepatic
   injury, myeloperoxidase in hepatic tissue, and histologic studies were
   analyzed at four hours postreperfusion.
   RESULTS: Survival improved from 15 percent for the rats in the ischemia
   control group to 55 percent for those in the group receiving
   anti-P-selectin antibody given 30 minutes before reperfusion (p<0.05).
   We observed an improved statistically significant difference in tests
   demonstrating hepatic injury, myeloperoxidase in hepatic tissue, and
   histologic studies in the treated and ischemia control groups. The other
   groups did not show consistent significant differences.
   CONCLUSIONS: P-selectin has a significant role in ischemia and
   reperfusion injury of the liver Early modulation of the interaction
   between P-selectin and its ligand decreased neutrophil adhesion and
   migration and consequently diminished damage to the liver.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of seed population on slope surfaces were studied to test
   the hypothesis that the lack of vegetation on badlands is caused by seed
   removal by erosion. The initial soil seed bank and two years of seed
   rain and seed removal by erosion were estimated in two small catchments,
   and a seed balance was constructed. In addition, six rainfall simulation
   experiments were performed to test the susceptibility of seeds to be
   removed by overland flow. A variety of soil surface conditions, rainfall
   characteristics and plot sizes were used in these experiments.
   Soil seed bank densities are low, but enough for the development of
   plant cover. Seed losses due to erosion after natural rains were low (<
   13 \%), and in agreement with seed losses from simulated rainfall
   experiments. After two years, seed inputs in the seed rain were greater
   than seed outputs through seed removal, which resulted in a continuous
   increase in the numbers of seeds in the soil bank. These results point
   out that seed removal by erosion is not the key factor explaining the
   lack of vegetation on badlands. It is suggested that other factors, such
   as those related to seed germination and seedling survival, may play an
   important role.}},

Abstract = {{1 Hypertensive transgenic (TGR(mRen-2)27) (abbreviated to TG) rats (n=6)
   and their normotensive Sprague-Dawley (SD) control strain (n=7) were
   chronically instrumented for the measurement of cardiac haemodynamics.
   The hypertension in TG rats (mean blood pressure 181+/-9 mmHg) was
   entirely attributable to a reduction in total peripheral conductance (TG
   rats=169+/-7, SD rats=292+/-15 mu l min(-1) mmHg(-1) 100g(-1)) since
   cardiac index was not different in the two strains (TG rats = 30.5 +/-
   1.2, SD rats = 29.5+/-1.6 ml min(-)1 100g(-1)).
   2 In other animals instrumented for the assessment of regional
   haemodynamics, the extent of peripheral vasoconstriction was similar in
   renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds in the TG rats
   (reduction in vascular conductance relative to SD rats=42\%, 46\% and
   49\%, respectively).
   3 During an 8h observation period with saline infusion, or following
   injection of losartan (10 mg kg(-1)) in SD rats there was no hypotension
   or regional vasodilatation. With infusion of the endothelin antagonist,
   SE 209670 (10 mu g kg(-1) min(-1)), there was a slight hypotension, but
   no significant vasodilatation; co-administration of losartan and SE
   209670 caused a similar profile of effect, although the hypotension was
   increased.
   4 With the same experimental protocol in TG rats, losartan caused a
   biphasic, progressive fall in mean arterial blood pressure accompanied
   by renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vasodilatation. Although the
   response to SE 209670 was not biphasic, its hypotensive and vasodilator
   effects were not different from those of losartan after 8 h. In the
   combined presence of losartan and SE 209670, mean arterial blood
   pressure (116+/-5 mmHg) was significantly lower than with SE 209670
   (132+/-4 mmHg) or losartan (136+/-6 mmHg) alone, and renal, mesenteric
   and hindquarters vascular conductances (61+/-3, 90+/-14 and 52+/-4
   {[}kHz mmHg(-1)]10(3), respectively) were higher than the corresponding
   values following either SE 209670 (49+/-4, 52+/-4 and 34+/-3 {[}kHz
   mmHg(-1)]10(3), respectively) or losartan (43+/-5, 59+/-13 and
   35+/-4{[}kHz mmHg(-1)]10(3), respectively) alone. These results indicate
   the maintenance of hypertension in TG rats is dependent upon renal,
   mesenteric and hindquarters vasoconstriction, mediated by angiotensin II
   (AII) and endothelin (ET). Since we found that plasma ET-1 levels in TG
   rats (12.06+/-2.87 pmol l(-1)) were lower than in SD rats (21.53+/-3.94
   pmol l(-1)), then it is possible that locally-generated, rather than
   circulating ET-1 contributes to the widespread vasoconstriction in TG
   rats.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To review the literature regarding screening and definitive

   after identification changes perinatal/neonatal outcome.
   Data Resources: Directed medicine searches.
   Results: Gestational Diabetes Mellitus is difined as carbohydrate
   intolerance of variable severity with onset or first recognition during
   pregnancy. The fetal and neonatal risks results from GDM continue to be
   controversial. There is an increased risk of macrosomia, birth trauma,
   and neonatal risks resulting from GDM continue to be controversial.
   There is an increased risk of macrosomia, birth trauma, and neonatal
   hypoglycemia but other metabolic complications are uncommon. There is
   still continuing debate as to whether there is an increase in congenita
   anomaly or stillbirth rate. Maternal risks include increased operative
   intervention, infections and hydramnios. Screening and definitive
   testing for GDM is undertaken to identify those pregnancies at risk for
   macrosomia, birth trauma and neonatal hypoglycemia in the hope that
   treatment will reduce this risk. However, at the present time there is
   inadequate evidence as to whether intensive management aimed at
   euglycemia meaningfully changes perinatal/neonatal outcome.
   Conclusion: In spite of conflicting evidence that treatment of GDM
   changes pregnancy outcome, screening and definitive testing for GDM
   should continue until large prospective trials confirm or refute the
   acceptance standard of care.}},

   the values of D=0.4 and D=0.8. Our data are consistent with the

Abstract = {{To investigate changes in spatial orientation ability and walking
   performance following space flight, 7 astronaut subjects were asked pre-
   and post-flight to perform a goal directed locomotion paradigm which
   consisted of walking a triangular path with and without vision. This new
   paradigm, involving inputs from different sensory systems, allows
   quantification of several critical parameters, like orientation
   performance, walking velocities and postural stability, in a natural
   walking task, The paper presented here mainly focusses on spatial
   orientation performance quantified by the errors in walking the
   previously seen path without vision, Errors in length and reaching the
   corners did not change significantly from pre- to post-flight, while
   absolute angular errors slightly increased post-flight, The significant
   decrease in walking velocity and a change in head-trunk coordination
   while walking around the corners of the path observed post-flight may
   suggest that during re-adaptation to gravity the mechanisms which are
   necessary to perform the task have to be re-accomplished.}},

Abstract = {{This open pilot study compared the analgesic efficacy and safety of
   tramadol with a combination of clomipramine/levomepromazine in the
   treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. The study allowed individualised
   dose finding at pre-determined intervals up to a maximum daily dose of
   600mg tramadol and 100mg each of clomipramine/levomepromazine. 21 (60\%)
   of 35 randomised patients were treated with study medication over the
   6-week period {[}tramadol n = 10; clomipramine (levomepromazine) n =
   11]. After 3 weeks' treatment the dosage in both, groups remained almost
   constant for the remaining 6-week treatment phase (mean daily dose:
   tramadol 250 to 290mg; clomipramine 59.1 to 63.6mg). In only 3 patients
   was a combination with levomepromazine necessary. In correlation with
   increasing study medication, the average pain level decreased to
   `slight' after initially being `moderate' to `very severe' in both
   groups. At the end of the treatment, 9 of 10 patients in the tramadol
   group and 6 of 11 patients in the clomipramine group retrospectively
   rated their analgesia as excellent, good or satisfactory. There were no
   significant differences in the current psychological/physical condition
   of the patients during tramadol treatment. Sensitivity and depression
   parameters decreased in the clomipramine group. The incidence of adverse
   events for all patients was comparable in both groups (tramadol 76.5\%;
   clomipramine/levomepromazine 83.3\%). In conclusion, tramadol appears to
   be an interesting therapeutic alternative for pain relief in
   postherpetic neuralgia.}},

Abstract = {{Greenway development efforts often give priority to corridor length and
   linkages as top selection criteria, but other factors are also critical
   in ensuring a successful network of greenways for recreation. On-site
   surveys of recreationists (n=2873) who used a diverse sample of 13
   greenway trails in metropolitan Chicago showed that trail location
   relative to home strongly influenced how a greenway trail was used, who
   used it, how often it was used, and other factors. `'Local'',
   `'regional'', and `'state'' trails are distinguished on the basis of use
   patterns, preferences, and perceptions, with each trail type filling a
   unique role within a metropolitan greenway system. In contrast to some
   greenway planning strategies, study data suggest that from a
   recreational use perspective, local rather than regional trails should
   form the basic framework of a metropolitan system. Study findings also
   demonstrate how vegetation management, trail surfacing, maintenance, and
   other factors can affect use patterns and preferences. Location, design,
   and management decisions that incorporate trail user information can
   help metropolitan greenway systems achieve a broad range of
   recreational, social, and environmental goals.}},

   a theoretical appraisal was undertaken of a sensor in a stereoscopic
   arrangement, and a mathematical model was derived for the calibration of
   a novel camera system. Algorithms to determine the 3-D relationship of
   points in the object space were developed using this model. To test the
   suitability of the model, a complete stereoscopic line-scan system was
   constructed. Experiments were conducted with the stereo camera to
   establish the accuracy that is achieved with such a system using the
   developed algorithms. The results indicate that the relative position of
   points in the object space could be determined to an accuracy of less
   than 1 mm at a range of 1.5 m.}},

   In the dentist group, both blood pressure and heart rate were found to
   be significantly higher during work than during leisure activities. In
   the control group, no significant difference in blood pressure was
   recorded between these periods. This study also showed the feasibility
   of ambulant 24-hour blood pressure registration on dentists during daily

Abstract = {{IMR32 cells express two classes of surface nicotinic receptors: those
   labelled with high affinity by {[}I-125]neuronal toxin, and those
   labelled by {[}(125)]alpha-bungarotoxin. Whole-cell patch-clamp
   recordings indicate that both classes of receptor are able to elicit
   inward currents that are totally blocked by d-tubocurarine but only
   partially blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin. In IMR32 cells, nicotine
   induces an increase in the intracellular level of free Ca2+. This
   increase, which is also completely blocked by d-tubocurarine and only
   partially blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin and Cd2+, is due to
   extracellular calcium influx through both the nicotinic receptors and
   the voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. By using subunit-specific
   polyclonal antibodies, we have demonstrated that the alpha-bungarotoxin
   receptors contain the alpha 7 subunit, but none of the other subunits
   whose transcripts are present in IMR32 cells. The pharmacological
   profile of these human alpha 7-containing alpha-bungarotoxin receptors
   is similar to that observed in the native chick alpha 7 receptor, but
   there are also some species-specific differences.}},

Abstract = {{We studied one sample of commercial sepiolite and two samples of
   commercial vermiculite - clay minerals proposed as replacements for
   asbestos - and tested in vitro their abilities to activate complement,
   to lyse erythrocytes, and to elicit the production of reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) or bovine
   alveolar macrophages (AM); their behavior was compared with that of
   asbestos fibers obtained from the Union International Contra Cancer
   (UICC) as reference standards, as well as with kaolinite and illite,
   main members of the clay mineral family.
   Since in short-term in vitro tests the biological activity of mineral
   particles seems especially related to the active sites on their surface,
   we first measured the specific surface area of each mineral. Sepiolite
   was unreactive in two of the three tests we used (complement activation
   and ROS production) and able to lyse a minimal percentage of red blood
   cells. Vermiculite was shown to be incapable of activating complement,
   to have a moderate hemolytic activity and a high ability to elicite ROS
   production, although lower than that of chrysotile. Sepiolite,
   therefore, might be of more interest than vermiculite, given the low
   level of biological effects detected during the tests used to compare
   both clay minerals with asbestos fibres. The ROS production does not
   seem to require phagocytosis. A high ROS production was observed with
   kaolinite: this result casts doubt on the ability of pathogenic mineral
   dusts in vitro to induce a greater release of ROS than nonpathogenic
   mineral dusts.}},

   appear to be important for antifeedant activity. The presence of a
   cyclohexenone or 1,2-epoxide in the A ring coupled with an alpha-hydroxy
   enone in the B ring correlated well with growth regulatory activity. An
   acetoxy at C-7 instead of or-hydroxy enone and perhaps the carbonyl at
   C-16 increase growth regulatory activity. Absence of 14-15 epoxide may
   not drastically reduce antifeedant activity and growth regulatory
   activity.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Design: Five percent to 10\% of cutaneous malignant
   melanomas (CMMs) occur in a familial setting. Clinical, epidemiologic,
   and genetic studies of familial CMM in different regions of the world
   have led to various results. To assess the characteristics of familial
   CMM in France, the clinical, histologic, and epidemiologic
   characteristics of 295 patients with CMM were recorded, and a
   comprehensive familial investigation was performed for each case.
   Patients with a family history of CMM were compared with nonfamilial
   cases.
   Results: Cutaneous malignant melanoma occurred as a familial cancer in
   22 (8\%) of 295 patients. Among the multiple variables studied, those
   significantly associated with the familial occurrence of CMM were red
   hair, inability to tan, and presence of clinically atypical moles. When
   these variables were considered together in a multivariate analysis,
   only the association with red hair (P=.001) and atypical moles (P<.05)
   remained significant. In addition, the patients with familial melanoma
   exhibited the following tendencies: a younger age at diagnosis, a higher
   number of moles, and the development of multiple primary melanomas, but
   these results did not reach statistical significance. Factors relating
   to UV light exposure, histologic features of CMM, course of the disease,
   and occurrence of nonmelanoma cancers showed a similar distribution
   between familial and nonfamilial cases.
   Conclusion: A familial investigation should be performed for each
   patient with CMM in France, particularly when he or she exhibits
   phenotypic risk factors for CMM such as red hair and atypical moles.}},

Abstract = {{Mounting evidence suggests that musculoskeletal disorders are prevalent
   among US retail food: workers. Cashiers who use electronic scanners
   appear to be at especially high risk for upper extremity musculoskeletal
   disorders. Checkstand design has been implicated as a contributor to
   musculoskeletal injury among cashiers because workstation design can
   significantly impact working posture. The present study examines working
   posture among two groups of cashiers to determine if checkstand design
   is associated with substantial differences in posture and movement
   during scanning. The work activities of twenty grocery cashiers using
   one of two checkstand designs (front-facing and right-hand takeaway)
   were examined. Videotapes of cashiers performing Scanning tasks were
   observed and associated postures and movements were visually coded. The
   right-hand takeaway design was associated with a significantly higher
   percentage of non-neutral trunk postures than the front-facing design.
   However, there were no significant differences in shoulder posture,
   grasp, or scanning motion associated with checkstand/scanner design.
   Factors that appeared to affect cashier work posture during scanning
   included stature, order size, and product type. Although improving the
   checkstand design may reduce the occurrence of certain awkward postures
   and static muscle loading conditions among cashiers, the success of
   these interventions is likely to be limited unless follow-up programmes
   are instituted to ensure that cashiers are able to use these designs
   effectively. Furthermore, fundamental changes in cashier work may be
   required to fully eliminate hazards for musculoskeletal disorders from
   this job.}},

Abstract = {{Hollow fiber membranes were used to enhance gas-liquid transport in a
   chemo-autotrophic methanogenic completely mixed batch reactor. Studies
   of the material transfer for gaseous substrates are typically based on
   the assumption that the primary resistance is transfer through the
   gas-liquid interface. We uncoupled the gas-liquid and liquid-microbe
   resistances, and evaluated their relative contributions. A reduction in
   the velocity gradient under a constant substrate flux into the bulk
   liquid shifted the observed limiting resistance from the gas-liquid
   interface to the liquid-microbial interface. This shift was manifested
   as an increase in the apparent half-saturation value. The result of this
   work significantly influences biochemical reactor design and/or
   evaluation. Although a reactor can be categorized as being completely
   mixed, based on spatial invariability of the biomass concentration, we
   demonstrated that significant mass transfer resistance may continue to
   reside in the liquid-microbe boundary layer.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the role of recombinant bovine aprotinin in
   reducing blood loss in coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Design: An
   open-label, randomized, controlled study evaluating two dosage levels of
   recombinant aprotinin, Setting: Two acute care hospitals (Northwestern
   Memorial Hospital, Chicago, III,, and the Scott \& White Memorial
   Hospital, Temple, Texas), Patients: Patients undergoing primary and
   reoperation coronary artery bypass grafting were assigned to groups by
   means of a computer-generated table of random numbers, Treated (n = 48)
   and control (n = 36) patients did not differ significantly in age, sex,
   weight, number of grafts, or preoperative hemoglobin level.
   Interventions: Recombinant aprotinin was given at two dosages, Dosage
   level 1 consisted of a bolus of 2 mg/kg intravenously immediately after
   the induction of anesthesia, 1 mg/kg added to each liter of the
   oxygenator prime, and 0.5 mg . kg(-1). hr(-1) infused continuously
   during operation, At dosage level 2, doses were doubled, Intraoperative
   monitoring of anti-factor Xa activity was performed, and additional
   doses of heparin were given on the basis of anti-factor Xa results, Main
   outcome measures: Preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels,
   amounts of autotransfusion device and chest tube drainage blood, and
   transfusions of allogeneic red blood cells, Adverse clinical events
   (alterations in renal function, graft thrombosis, myocardial infarction,
   and death) were recorded, Results: Additional heparin was given to 48\%
   patients in the aprotinin group and to 44\% of control patients, Overall
   red blood cell loss (in milliliters, mean +/- standard deviation {[}SD])
   was decreased with aprotinin at dosage level 1 for reoperations (1040
   +/- 162 vs 1544 +/- 198, p < 0.01), and at dosage level 2 for all
   operations (primary operations, 886 +/- 362 vs 1333 +/- 618, p = 0.02;
   reoperations, 1191 +/- 560 vs 1815 +/- 1116, p = 0.2), Fewer patients in
   the aprotinin than in the control group had transfusions of donated
   blood (6/48 vs 12/36, p = 0.02) or reinfusion of chest tube drainage
   blood (12/48 vs 20/36, p < 0.01), Among patients receiving dosage level
   1, there were no myocardial infarctions or deaths, At dosage level 2,
   one patient had profound bradycardia and died on day 12 and two patients
   had late graft closures, Two control patients had hypotension after
   bypass necessitating intraaortic balloon pumps, and one of these
   patients died, Postoperative increases in blood urea nitrogen and
   creatinine levels were small in both aprotinin and control groups. No
   hypersensitivity or other allergic reactions occurred, Conclusion: We
   conclude that, at the dosages given, recombinant bovine aprotinin
   decreases surgical blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients
   undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, but its use requires
   appropriate monitoring of heparin use during bypass. Whether higher
   dosages of aprotinin increase the risk of graft thrombosis must be
   further assessed with a larger patient sample.}},

Abstract = {{Vitamin A influences growth and reproduction in horses. A retinol dose
   response (RDR) test for retinol has been shown to be better than serum
   retinol concentration for assessing vitamin A status in other species,
   so we have compared these two methods in the horse. Forty-five
   Thoroughbred broodmares were assigned randomly to three groups fed
   pasture and hay (PH), pasture, hay and vitamin A-free concentrate (PHC),
   or hay and concentrate (HC) in early summer (May 1991). Mares in pasture
   groups produced 23 foals (March through June) that had access to their
   dam's diets and were also studied. In the mares, significant vitamin A
   depletion developed in 2 mo in the nonpasture group (HC) and in 8 mo in
   the two pasture groups (PH and PHC) according to the RDR test, and in
   all three groups at 8 mo as shown by a decrease in serum retinol
   concentration. In the weanlings (PH and PHC only), no differences
   between groups were found for serum retinol, but the RDR was
   significantly higher in the PH group, which had suffered a respiratory
   infection, than in the PHC group. These findings indicated that vitamin
   A depletion was detected more readily by the RDR test than by serum
   retinol concentration, that consumption of pasture delayed depletion in
   the late fall, and that infection was associated with lower vitamin A
   status.}},

Abstract = {{Unsaturated polyesters and dicarboxy diesters from maleic anhydride and
   various diols were investigated by means of H-1 and C-13 nuclear
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The carbons of diol units were found to
   be sensitive to maleate/fumarate transformation, enabling the process to
   be followed in detail. The cis-trans isomerism of dicarboxy diesters was
   described and related to the structure of the corresponding diols. The
   effects induced by the isomerism were examined separately for various
   carbons and, in the case of 1,2-propylene glycol, direct evidence was
   provided of the preference of CH over CH2 groups in promoting the trans
   isomer. The results of the study on dicarboxy diesters along with data
   concerning the distribution of diol units along the chain were utilized
   to interpret the isomerism of unsaturated mixed polyesters.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Needle localization biopsy is commonly performed for the
   diagnosis of mammographic abnormalities, Routine specimen radiography is
   generally recommended, but the value of routine short-interval
   postbiopsy mammography has not been analyzed.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 299
   consecutive localized biopsies in 286 women from March 1989 to November
   1993. Of these biopsies, 217 form the basis for this study; all yielded
   a benign pathologic diagnosis and had both specimen radiography and
   3-month interval mammograms performed,
   RESULTS: A total of 192 (88\%) of postbiopsy mammograms were interpreted
   as negative, while 22 (10\%) were suspicious, Three patients had second
   biopsies and all had benign diagnoses, 16 had follow-up mammograms that
   were interpreted as normal or Stable, and 3 patients were lost to
   follow-up, A suspicious postbiopsy mammogram had no significant
   relationship to initial mammographic abnormality or pathologic
   diagnosis, but did correlate with specimen radiograph interpretation (P
   = 0.02 by chi-square comparison).
   CONCLUSIONS: In a series of needle localization biopsies with
   intraoperative specimen radiography, postbiopsy mammography failed to
   reveal any missed cancers, Short-interval follow-up mammography is
   unnecessary to assess for residual abnormalities when specimen
   radiography confirms excision of the abnormality.}},

   croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), were compared either after activation
   in artificial sea water or when immersed in various osmotic pressure
   media. The midpieces of these three teleosts spermatozoa are composed of
   mitochondria surrounding the flagellum. Each mitochondrion is enclosed
   by distinct outer and inner membranes. The inner membrane separates the
   organelle's volume into two phases: the matrix and the intermembrane
   space. The inner membrane displays numerous infolding cristae that vary
   in number and shape and extend into the matrix. Following activation
   with artificial sea water, spermatozoa became motile and both the size
   and number of mitochondria decrease and then totally disappear. The
   present study strongly suggests that an energy source(s), responsible

Abstract = {{Photoelectron imaging is a sensitive surface technique in which photons
   are used to excite electron emission. This novel method has been applied
   successfully in studies of relatively flat cultured cells, viruses, and
   protein-DNA complexes. However, rounded-up cell types such as tumor
   cells frequently are more difficult to image. By comparing photoelectron
   images of uncoated and metal-coated MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells,
   it is shown that the problem is specimen charging rather than a
   fundamental limitation of the electron imaging process. This is
   confirmed by emission current measurements on uncoated monolayers of
   MCF-7 carcinoma cells and flatter, normal Wi-38 fibroblasts. We report
   here that sample charging in photoelectron microscopy can be eliminated
   in most specimens by simultaneous use of two light sources-the standard
   UV excitation source (e.g., 254 nm) and a longer wavelength light source
   (e.g., 325 nm). The reduction in sample charging results largely from
   enhanced photoconduction in the bulk sample and greatly extends the
   range of cells that can be examined by photoelectron imaging. The
   contributions of photoconductivity, the electric field of the imaging
   system, and the short escape depths of the photoelectrons combine to
   make photoelectron imaging a uniquely sensitive technique for the study
   of biological surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Cheek rubbing is thought to be a form of active scent marking in many
   terrestrial and arboreal sciurids. However, some observations of
   arboreal sciurids suggest that cheek rubbing may also be a form of
   self-grooming. The purpose of this study was to examine possible
   functions of cheek rubbing by free-living Abert squirrels, Sciurus
   aberti. When the frequencies of behaviour patterns that occurred within
   a cheek-rubbing sequence were compared to the frequencies of acts that
   occurred at other times, grooming and alert behaviour patterns had a
   higher probability of occurring, whereas travelling, nesting, and
   Various social behaviour patterns (such as chasing) had a significantly
   lower probability of occurring during cheek-rubbing sequences.
   Food-related behaviour patterns or grooming usually preceded cheek
   rubbing. Cheek rubbing also did not predominantly occur at home-range
   boundaries or at nest sites. Although passive scent marking cannot be
   ruled out, these results suggest that cheek rubbing by Abert squirrels
   has evolved more as a form of self-grooming to remove food residue,
   rather than as active scent marking. (C) 1995 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Stimulation of Cl secretion by prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) was measured
   as the short-circuit current (I-sc) across isolated epithelium of the
   rabbit distal colon. Cellular morphology of columnar and goblet cells
   during secretion was monitored using light and electron microscopy.
   Stimulation by PGE(2) altered epithelial cell morphology only by a
   reduction of vacuolar space in the apical pole of crypt columnar cells,
   consistent with release of vacuole contents. Imaging of isolated crypts
   using differential interference microscopy confirmed the release of
   material from columnar cells during the onset of secretion. Inhibition
   of Cl secretion with the loop diuretic bumetanide did not block vacuole
   release. The actin filament-disrupting agent, cytochalasin, reduced the
   PGE(2)-stimulated I-sc by 40\% and blocked emptying of the vacuolar
   space. These electrical and morphological results indicate that the
   process of active ion secretion is associated with release of the
   macromolecular contents from apical vacuoles through a mechanism
   involving the cytoskeleton. In addition, this relationship supports the
   concept that vacuolated columnar cells of the crypts of Lieberkuhn are
   the cell type that secretes Cl in response to PGE(2).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility
   patterns of microorganisms causing acute community-acquired lung
   abscess.
   Design: A prospective survey. Setting: Medical emergency department and
   wards of a tertiary teaching hospital.
   Patients: Thirty-four adult patients with both clinical and radiologic
   features compatible with a diagnosis of acute community-acquired lung
   abscess who had received less than 48 h of antibiotic therapy.
   Interventions: Microbiologic specimens obtained by percutaneous lung
   aspiration and with a protected specimen brush via fiberoptic
   bronchoscopy were submitted for aerobic and anaerobic culture.
   Main outcome measures: Identification of all microorganisms, including
   anaerobes, and determination of antibiotic susceptibility.
   Results: A mean of 2.3 bacterial species per patient was isolated,
   anaerobes alone being isolated in 44\% of cases, aerobes alone in 19\%,
   and mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates in 22\%. Aerobic Gram-negative
   pathogens were uncommon. In seven patients, Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   was identified; in two it was associated with other bacteria. In four
   patients, no organisms were isolated. All the nonmycobacterial isolates
   were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate and in addition the
   anaerobes were all susceptible to chloramphenicol and almost all to a
   combination of penicillin and metronidazole. Among the anaerobes, the
   level of resistance to penicillin, metronidazole, and clindamycin
   individually was 21\%, 12\%, and 5\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Community-acquired acute lung abscess is usually caused by
   multiple anaerobic and less frequently aerobic Gram-positive
   microorganisms, which should respond to empirical therapy with
   amoxicillin-clavulanate, chloramphenicol, or a combination of penicillin
   and metronidazole. Tuberculosis, which may be indistinguishable from an
   acute lung abscess, occurred in 21\% of patients in our study. Most
   bacterial pathogens are sensitive to conventional antimicrobial therapy
   and further investigation with percutaneous lung aspiration or
   bronchoscopy is indicated only when there is lack of early response to
   therapy or there is the presence of atypical clinical features.}},

Abstract = {{Computer vision methods were used to study crack growth and crack
   blunting in thin, 304 stainless steel single edge cracked (SEC)
   specimens with various a/w ratios. The in-plane displacement and strain
   distributions in the vicinity of the crack tip before and after crack
   growth were obtained and compared with theoretical predictions.
   Results for a growing crack indicate that for small amounts of crack
   growth, a critical value for the omega factor is a predictor of the
   presence of HRR-type fields. Specifically, with Delta a < 0.08a(o) and
   omega > 10, where a,is the initial crack length, the crack tip
   deformation fields have the same form as observed for stationary cracks;
   the HRR dominant zones exist for V and epsilon(yy) but the field
   variables U, epsilon(xx) and epsilon(xy) have either non-existent or
   much smaller HRR zones. For a limited range of crack growth (0.08a(o) <
   Delta a < 0.20a(o)), trends in the crack tip deformation fields in a
   segment of the crack tip region are reasonably predicted by the plane
   strain, quasi-static growing crack tip fields. For larger amounts of
   crack growth (Delta a > 0.20 x a(o)), available theories were unable to
   predict the observed deformations.
   The J-integral, crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) and crack tip
   opening angle (CTOA) were investigated to determine if they can be used
   as fracture parameters for thin specimens. Results indicate that the
   CTOD-Delta a and CTOA-Delta a curves were reasonably independent of a/w
   ratios for all Delta a, with CTOA having the admirable quality of being
   constant during crack growth for Delta a > t. The J(avg)-Delta a (J(r))
   trends were independent of a/w ratio only for Delta a < t, where t is
   the specimen thickness, with a substantial increase in scatter for
   larger Delta a. In addition, it was determined that the general form of
   the CTOA-Delta a data appears to be due to crack tunneling within the
   thin specimen for Delta a < t, with the initial large values of CTOA
   occuring during the tunneling phase of crack extension. Finally, the
   elastic unloading phenomenon for a growing crack was investigated and
   found to be in reasonable agreement with analytical predictions.}},

Abstract = {{In vivo S-phase cell labeling with iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) was
   performed in six multiple myeloma (MM) patients, Myeloma cells from four
   patients were hyperploid. In three out of four patients, DNA/IdUrd now
   cytometry revealed that most of the labeled cells, which had divided
   during the period, elapsed between flash labeling and sampling, had
   returned to the diploid G0/G1 compartment and not to the hyperdiploid
   peak, To eliminate contaminating cells belonging to the normal
   hematopoiesis, plasmocytic and lymphocytic cells were fractionated and
   analyzed separately, Cell enrichment was performed with use of murine
   monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against plasmocytic and lymphocytic cell
   markers and subsequent magnetic activated cell sorting with immunobeads,
   i.e,, polysterene magnetic particles coated with sheep anti-mouse IgG,
   The purified plasmocytic cells were mainly hyperdiploid and largely
   unlabeled, The lymphocytic cells appeared to belong chiefly to the
   diploid cell population. The IdUrd-labeled cells were predominantly
   lymphocytic cells, returning after mitosis to the diploid G0/G1 peak.
   Although this pattern of S-phase cells in hyperdiploid MM, belonging to
   the diploid cell compartment, was observed in three out of four
   hyperploid cases and although the number of observations is small,
   S-phase cells may demonstrate an aspect of tumor cell kinetics in
   hyperploid MM, which has been debated for many years and which indicates
   the existence of a non-plasmocytic stem cell compartment that feeds the
   plasmocytoma, The behavior of the labeled cells as observed in a few
   cases of MM provides another, hitherto undescribed, argument that, at
   least in some MM patients, a part of the proliferating tumor cells may
   be diploid lymphocytic (precursor) cells. These findings should be
   considered when targeting and monitoring treatment of MM and also in
   purging procedures of bone marrow in patients to be treated by ablative
   cytotoxic therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation. (C) 1995

   Basin states of California, Nevada, and Arizona suffered only slight
   shortages. Upper Basin reservoirs and streamflows were also more heavily
   affected than those in the Lower Basin by the severe drought.
   System-wide, total hydropower generation was 84 percent less in the
   drought scenario than in the historical streamflow scenario. Annual,

Abstract = {{In the present study the regions of the brain showing an increase in the
   number of FOS protein stained cells 180 min following intravenous saline
   or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment were investigated and
   correlated with changes in body temperature and plasma corticosterone
   levels. Particular attention was given to the possible involvement of
   the circumventricular organs and regions of the brainstem containing
   central noradrenergic neurones. LPS at doses of 0.35, 3.5 and 50 mu g
   caused highly significant increases in FOS protein expression in the
   organum vasculosum of lamina terminalis, the area postrema and the
   subfornical organ compared with saline controls. Marked increases in
   bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced FOS protein expression were
   observed in the ventrolateral medulla, the nucleus of the solitary tract
   and the locus coeruleus which contain the Al, A2 and As noradrenergic
   neurones respectively. The changes in body temperature induced by LPS
   were found to be dependent upon the dose of LPS administered; the lowest
   dose employed (0.35 mu g) induced an immediate and sustained fever, 3.5
   mu g LPS caused a biphasic response consisting of a hypothermic response
   followed by a febrile response, whereas 50 mu g LPS induced a
   hypothermic response which then normalised by 160 min post-injection.
   Intravenous saline injection had no significant effect on body
   temperature. The occurance of LPS-induced hypothermia was coincident
   with increased FOS expression in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis,
   which houses vasopressinergic neurones involved in antipyresis, whereas
   in animals showing an LPS-induced febrile response there was no
   significant difference in the number of FOS stained cells in the bed
   nucleus of stria terminalis compared with saline treated animals. LPS
   also caused marked increases in FOS protein expression in the
   parvocellular regions of the paraventricular nucleus (pPVN) of the
   hypothalamus, the central nucleus of the amygdala and the ventral septal
   area. Plasma corticosterone was unaffected by the lowest dose of LPS
   (0.35 mu g), however the higher doses employed (3.5 and 50 mu g) caused
   significant increases in plasma corticosterone which correlated with the
   increases in the number of FOS stained cells in the pPVN. The results of
   the present study suggest that, in addition to the organum vasculosum of
   lamina terminalis, the area postrema and subfornical organ may be
   important in the responses to antigenic challenge that are mediated by
   the central nervous system. They also add support to the possible
   involvement of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis in LPS-induced
   hypothermia and of the involvement of the of the major noradrenergic
   cell groups (A1, A2 \& A6) and a number of hypothalamic and
   extrahypothalamic forebrain regions in the interaction of immune and
   central nervous systems.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Blood flow to the brain is extremely sensitive to changes in
   PCO2, While animal studies show a similar potent PCO2 dependence in
   retinal and choroidal vessels, the PCO2-retinal blood flow relationship
   has never been adequately studied in humans.
   Methods: Video scanning laser ophthalmoscopy after fluorescein
   angiography was used to analyze retinal arterial and capillary blood
   velocity under conditions of mild hypercapnia and hypocapnia. Control
   conditions (end-tidal PCO2 = 38.3 +/- 0.4 mmHg) were contrasted with
   hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia (PCO2 = 34.0 +/- 0.4 mmHg) and
   hypercapnia (PCO2 = 42.3 +/- 0.5 mmHg) created by PCO2 addition to
   inspired gas.
   Results: Both larger vessel and macular capillary blood velocity was
   dependent upon PCO2: arteriovenous passage time fell as PCO2 rose, and
   both mean arterial dye velocity and capillary blood velocity rose as
   PCO2 rose (all p<0,05). These changes in flow velocity occurred despite
   unchanged heart rate, arterial systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
   intraocular pressure, and calculated ocular perfusion pressure. Contrast
   sensitivity was also unchanged by PCO2 variation.
   Conclusions: The human retinal circulation, like the whole cerebral
   circulation, may be strongly dependent upon PCO2 in a manner that is
   unrelated to perfusion pressure and apparently outside strict
   autoregulatory controls.}},

   food-derived mammary and colon carcinogen,
   2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo{[}4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), were
   investigated in rats, Female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered PhIP
   in the diet (100 ppm) for 4 weeks before mating with nontreated males
   and also during gestation and lactation, As controls, additional females
   were maintained on the basal diet without PhIP and mated as with the
   treated animals, The offspring of both groups were subdivided for each
   sex at weaning into three dietary groups receiving 100, 25, and 0 ppm
   and were killed at 47 weeks of age. Effects of the transplacental and
   neonatal exposure to PhIP on mammary carcinogenesis were most evident in
   females administered 25 ppm PhIP after weaning; the incidence and
   multiplicity of adenocarcinomas in offspring from the PhIP fed dams
   (42.9\%, 0.62/rat) was significantly higher than the value for offspring
   from nontreated dams (4.8\%, 0.05/rat), Furthermore, in the basal diet
   groups, the incidence of adenocarcinomas in females was higher, albeit
   not significantly, in offspring of the PhIP-treated than the nontreated
   dams (16.7\%, 0.22/rat as compared with 3.3\%, 0.07/rat). Although the
   highest incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas was found in the female
   progeny given 100 ppm PhIP from PhIP-treated dams (70.0\%, 1.55/rat),
   this was only slightly higher than the 61.9\% and 0.90/rat of the same
   dose group from the nontreated dams. In males, no apparent effects of
   transplacental and neonatal exposures were evident. In a separate
   experiment, excretion of PhIP into breast milk and transfer of PhIP to
   fetuses and neonates with resultant hepatic PhIP-DNA adduct formation
   were demonstrated. Thus, maternal exposure to this food-derived
   carcinogen may be a critical risk factor for generation of mammary
   carcinomas.}},

Abstract = {{The development of systemic disease from primary inoculum sources of

   slope of the gradient flattened as the epidemic progressed, The steepest
   gradient of disease incidence was observed downwind. The progress in
   time and spread in space of disease about primary foci is described by
   three non-linear models which fit the data equally well. However, the
   resulting gradients at wider distances are different. With two models
   the gradients decrease asymptotically to zero with increasing distance,
   whilst the other model leads to negative values above a certain
   distance. The rates of isopath movement of all models decrease with
   time, but the effect of distance on the isopathic rate is different; the

Abstract = {{Opinions on the phylogeny and classification of the Polypodiaceae sensu
   stricto have been particularly divergent and recent DNA sequencing
   analyses have supported the hypothesis that this group should be allied
   to the higher indusiate ferns. Within the genus Polypodium, isozymic and
   restriction site analyses demonstrated that interspecific genetic
   identities are quite low, suggesting that sequences of the conservative
   rbcL gene would be appropriate for addressing open systematic questions.
   Average infrageneric sequence divergence (1.87\%) was sufficient to
   generate reliable species differences, and the skewness test of randomly
   generated trees suggested that the data were non random and probably
   phylogenetically informative. A strict consensus of the eight most
   parsimonious trees supported the monophyly of the P. vulgare complex,
   and decay analysis showed that primary tree branches were well
   supported. Most of the phylogenetically informative nucleotides were at
   third codon positions. Neotropical Polypodinm species were chosen a
   priori as a close out-group, and emerged as a sister group to the P.
   vulgare complex. Polypodium amorphum + P. appalachianum formed a clade
   that was morphologically supported by the synapomorphic feature of
   sporangiasters in the sori. Although the indication that P. glycyrrhiza
   was related to the Asian species P. fauriei was not unexpected, the
   close association of these two species with P. scouleri was quite
   surprising, and provided insights on the possible origin of the latter
   species through adaptation to stressful habitats. Whereas the long held
   hypothesis of a close association between P. australe and P.
   macaronesicum was upheld, the rbcL sequence data could provide no
   insights on the phylogeny of the enigmatic Hawaiian endemic, P.
   pellucidum. Pleopeltis thyssanolepis, until recently classified as a
   Polypodium, was solidly allied to Pleopeltis macrocarpa var. complanata.
   It is anticipated that future molecular analyses will provide additional
   insights on the evolutionary history of the Polypodiaceae.}},

Abstract = {{The paper focuses on the articulation of two areas of theory: that of
   development of the self through fragmentation and differentiation and
   that of narcissism in early psychological development, and its pathology
   later in life. Jungian ideas concerning the self and individuation
   (including those developed by Fordham) are linked with psychoanalytic
   ideas, notably Kohut's, and related to the concepts of narcissism and
   ego-development. In this the focus is on a revaluation of the negative
   overtones of `fragmentation' and `narcissism' and an indication of their
   place in the process of individuation. It is pointed out that a varying
   emphasis in the analyst on what are called the biological and
   ethological aspects of these theories will have important implications
   for the treatment of patients. The theoretical position is illustrated
   by a lengthy clinical example involving a case of early injury to the
   self which suggests the pathology of narcissistic character disorder.
   But the case also illustrates the contribution to development of
   fragmentation and narcissism, which are revalued here as the
   `part-for-the-whole' and as one of the `motors' of individuation.
   Working within a perspective that prioritizes the importance of the
   drive towards relationship, it is recommended that the analyst learns to
   respect and value phenomenologically the contribution of fragmentation
   and narcissism to normal development, if true healing is to occur.}},

   plasma instability is experimentally studied using a Double Plasma
   device. When an electron beam is injected into the target plasma,
   standing waves around the electron plasma frequency are excited. A test
   wave is propagated in an electron beam plasma system and is identified
   as the beam mode from the dispersion relation. The propagation direction
   of the beam mode is determined from the wave pattern utilizing a phase
   shifter. It is found that a reflected beam mode exists as well as a
   forward beam mode, and is generated by the reflection of the forward
   beam mode from a potential well produced by the injection of the
   electron beam. The observed standing waves are formed by superposing the
   beam modes propagating in opposite directions from each other. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Natural clay materials can limit the subsurface mobility of dissolved
   heavy metals by providing sites for cation sorption and exchange. The
   objective of this research is to determine the influence of porewater
   velocity on these attenuation mechanisms. Zinc was selected to evaluate
   the reactive properties of a clay-bearing sand (4\% bentonite clay, 96\%
   silica sand) under different flow conditions. Columns containing the
   clay-bearing sand were used to generate solute breakthrough curves
   (BTCs) for zinc solutions at porewater velocities of 1.4 x 10(-5), 6.1 x
   10(-4), 8.3 x 10(-4), and 4.8 x 10(-3) cm s(-1). Zinc influent
   concentrations of 2.1 x 10(-4) M and 2.1 x 10(-5) M were employed in
   column and batch experiments. Chloride is used as a conservative solute
   to determine the mechanical flow properties of the clay-bearing sand.
   Zinc BTCs indicate a non-equilibrium process based upon rate-limited
   diffusive mass transfer between bulk solution and non-advective pore
   space, where numerous sorption-exchange sites may exist. Models for
   similar systems which incorporate the `'local equilibrium assumption''
   and neglect diffusive mass transfer limitations may underestimate
   contaminant mobility at higher flow rates and over-estimate the
   contaminant removal efficacy of pump-and-treat remediation in field
   applications.}},

   gestational weeks) and mouse (9.5-17.5 gestational days) fetuses was
   examined. Northern hybridization with specific OP-1 probes revealed two
   mRNA species of 4 and 2.2 KB. Highest levels of OP-1 mRNA were found in
   human fetal kidney and heart between 12-14 weeks of gestation. By in
   situ hybridization, the OP-1 transcripts were found in various tissues,
   i.e., the ectodermal epithelium of the mouse fore- and hindlimbs, heart,
   teeth, intestinal epithelium, perichondrium, hypertrophic chondrocytes,
   and periosteum/osteoblast layer of developing human bones, in kidneys,
   transcripts were first detected in the epithelium of the branching

Abstract = {{Isolated unilateral lung contusion (LC) was induced in 12 pigs to
   determine the pathophysiological role of LC in the high mortality after
   multiple injury. The Horovitz quotient, pulmonary vascular resistance,
   mean pulmonary artery pressure, mixed venous oxygen consumption,
   inspiratory pressure and compliance were significantly decreased in the
   LC group as compared to controls, The number of polymorphonuclear
   granulocytes, the microvascular permeabilty of albumine and the Wilhelmy
   balance as determined by bronchoalveolar lavage were significantly
   increased after lung contusion. As indicators of a systemic reaction we
   found elevated plasma levels of the terminal complement complex and
   decreased levels of the complement factor 3a after LC. The morphological
   assessment revealed changes such as those encountered during the early
   phase of adult respiratory distress syndrome, with granulocyte sticking,
   endothelial cell adhesion and transendothelial diapedesis. Morphometric
   analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in alveolar diameter in
   both the injured and the contralateral lung due to impaired surfactant
   surface activity. A distinct increase in septal diameter, related to
   edema and caused by increased microvascular permeability, was found in
   the injured lungs, These findings emphasize that LC leads to a
   generalized impairment of the entire lung, which may lead to progressive

Abstract = {{Researchers representing each of the Colorado River Basin states as well

   computer simulation of a progressively increasing drought and were given
   the collective opportunity to change the ways in which basin-wide and
   within-state water management were conducted. The purpose of this
   `'gaming'' exercise was to identify rules for managing the Colorado
   River which are effective in preventing drought-caused damages to basin
   water users. This water management game was conducted three times,
   varying the collective choice rules for management of the river yet
   staying substantially within the current institution for management of
   the Colorado River known as the `'Law of the River.'' The Law of the
   River was quite effective in minimizing drought impacts upon consumptive
   water uses. Additional effective drought-coping measures to protect
   consumptive uses consisted mostly of intrastate water management
   improvements which states were able to implement independently. The Law
   of the River did not protect non-consumptive water uses, such as
   hydroelectric power generation, water-based recreation, endangered
   species, and water quality from drought, as well as it protected
   consumptive water uses. Players reached collective choice decisions to
   cope with rising salinity, equalize storage between the upper and lower
   basins, and protect endangered species. While these measures had some
   success, only reductions in withdrawals for consumptive uses,
   particularly in the upper basin, could have substantially lessened
   adverse impacts.}},

Title = {{BONE-MINERAL DENSITY AND BONE TURNOVER BEFORE AND AFTER SURGICAL CURE OF

Abstract = {{We measured bone mineral density (BMD) using dual-energy x-ray
   absorptiometry in 20 patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) (14 pre- and
   2 postmenopausal women, 4 men) before and in 18 of them also at regular
   intervals after surgical cure (median duration of follow-up, 36 months).
   In addition, in the premenopausal women with CS, fasting blood samples
   and 2-h fasting urine samples for measurement of biochemical parameters
   of bone and collagen metabolism were collected before and in 9 of them
   also at regular intervals during the first 2 yr after surgery. Marked
   osteopenia was present in most patients with active CS (Z-scores: lumbar
   spine -1.45 +/- 1.44 and femoral neck -1.50 +/- 1.02; mean +/- SD). No
   consistent change in BMD was observed at 3 and 6 months after surgery.
   Thereafter BMD increased considerably in almost all patients. For the 15
   patients with a follow-up of at least 1 yr, Z-scores at the last
   evaluation were -0.65 +/- 1.27 for the lumbar spine and -0.98 +/- 1.02
   for the femoral neck (both P < 0.002 compared with pretreatment values).
   In the premenopausal patients, the increase in BMD both in the lumbar
   spine and in the femoral neck at 24 months was inversely correlated with
   age (r = -0.733, P < 0.03, and r = -0.667, P < 9.05, respectively).
   Serum levels of osteocalcin bone alkaline phosphatase, carboxyterminal
   propeptide of type I procollagen, aminoterminal propeptide of type III
   procollagen, and the cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen were
   not significantly different between the group of 14 premenopausal
   patients with active CS and a control group of 18 age-matched healthy
   premenopausal women. However, the urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine
   ratio was significantly higher in patients with CS (24.6 +/- 9.6 vs.
   16.2 +/- 3.5 mu mol/mmol, P < 0.01). In all 9 premenopausal patients,
   serum levels of osteocalcin increased considerably between 0 and 3
   months (from 1.04 +/- 0.20 to 3.82 +/- 0.30 nmol/L) (mean +/- SEM, P <
   0.0001), indicating a prompt increase of osteoblast activity. Also serum
   levels of carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen,
   aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen, and cross-linked
   telopeptide of type I collagen, and the urinary
   hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio increased significantly between 0 and 3
   months. Thereafter these levels decreased gradually. We conclude that
   marked osteopenia in the lumbar spine and femoral neck is present in
   most patients with active Cushing's syndrome. Bone density does not
   consistently change in the first 6 months after cure, despite an
   apparently rapid restoration of osteoblast activity. Thereafter
   remarkable improvement of bone density can be observed in almost all
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Diagrams of fossil pollen in three deposits postdating glacial recession
   of the last ice age provide an account of late-glacial and Holocene
   vegetation and palaeoclimate in Southern Patagonia. Sites are mires,
   located along the Estrecho de Magallanes at Punta Arenas (53 degrees
   09'S, 70 degrees 57'W) and Puerto del Hambre (53 degrees 36'S, 70
   degrees 55'W), and an intermittent lake, some 300 km to the north, at
   Torres del Paine (50 degrees 59'S, 72 degrees 40'W). Chronostratigraphy
   is controlled by 20 radiocarbon dates, the oldest site (Puerto del
   Hambre) covering close to 16 000 years. Charcoal from the sites and
   carbonate (Torres del Paine), as well as tephra layers and an instance
   of marine incursion (Puerto del Hambre), supply additional data of
   interpretive value. Accompanying the fossil pollen records is a
   reference survey of modern pollen fallout from 43 surface sample
   localities.
   Late-glacial vegetation during deglaciation consisted mostly of tundra,
   dominated by communities of Empetrum, Acaena, Gunnera, and Tubuliflorae
   (Compositae), under a relatively cold, dry climate. Nothofagus, although
   present in numbers initially at Puerto del Hambre, did not expand until
   the close of the late-glacial; at Punta Arenas, expansion of Nothofagus
   was episodic, occurring during apparent warmer intervals of the last
   three millennia of steppe-tundra.
   Holocene vegetation is depicted at first as a patchwork of Nothofagus
   woodland and steppe subject to climate of relative warmth and limited
   moisture, except at Torres del Paine, where moisture levels were
   apparently higher than at sites to the south. Closed Nothofagus forest
   communities, subsequently, are best developed in the late Holocene under
   a climate with generally cooler, wetter parameters. Fire, believed to be
   caused mostly by Palaeoindians, has had an important role in shaping
   vegetation sequences in the Holocene. Formidable, however, in the
   development of vegetation are the latitudinal displacements/variable
   intensities of atmospheric conditions caused by shifting storm tracks of
   the Southern Westerlies.}},

Abstract = {{Vav is a signal transducing molecule containing SH2 and SH3 domains and
   a guanine nucleotide releasing factor-like domain. Its expression is
   thought to be highly specific for hematopoietic cells. Here we describe
   the expression of vav transcripts in human nonhematopoietic
   trophoblasts. By Northern blotting, expression of 2.8-kb vav mRNA was
   detected in human decidual, placental, and chorionic villous tissues and
   in a choriocarcinoma cell line BeWo. By in situ hybridization, vav mRNA
   was found to be expressed in the cytotrophoblast shell and columns and
   in the extravillous trophoblasts in the maternal decidua from the first
   through third trimesters. Vav mRNA was also detected in villous
   syncytiotrophoblasts du ring the second and third, but not the first,
   trimesters. When 1 mu M oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to the vav mRNA
   was added to the medium, growth of BeWo cells was significantly
   inhibited. These results suggest that vav plays an important role for
   successful implantation and placental development by regulating
   development of trophoblasts.}},

   Measurements were made of complement activation (radioimmunoassay for

   measurements of reactive oxygen species production, granulocyte
   CD11b/CD18 (MAC-1) expression and CD62L (L-selectin) expression), sCR1
   completely abolished the generation of plasma C3a desArg during ex vivo

   ng/ml to 4961 +/- 40 ng/ml by the end of the ex vivo procedure (p <
   0.001), sCR1 also completely inhibited MAC-I upregulation and L-selectin

   was still a statistically significant increase in granulocyte reactive

Abstract = {{The Coupled Dipole method is used to simulate Elastic Light Scattering
   from arbitrary shaped particles. To facilitate simulation of relative
   large particles, such as human white blood cells, the number of dipoles
   required for the simulation is approximately 10(5) to 10(6). In order to
   carry out such simulations, very powerful computers are necessary. We
   have designed a parallel version of the Coupled Dipole method, and have
   implemented it on a distributed memory parallel computer, a Parsytec
   PowerXplorer, containing 32 Power PC-601 processors. The efficiency of
   the parallel implementation is investigated for simulations of model
   particles. Scattering by a sphere, modelled with 33552 dipoles, is
   simulated and compared with analytical Mie theory. Finally the
   suitability of the Coupled Dipole method to simulate Elastic Light
   Scattering from larger particles, such as white blood cells, is
   discussed.}},

   0.85 \% we had trouble with the healing. In 3.5 \% extraction could not

   have been lower as compared in literature. In our opinion the extraction

Abstract = {{The morphology and acoustic characteristics of the acoustic tracheal
   system were examined in certain tettigoniid species. Morphological
   measurements and statistical analysis reveal that in all species of
   bushcrickets investigated the shape of the acoustic trachea can be
   approximated by the equation of an exponential horn. Based on this
   approximation the transmission functions of the different tracheae were
   calculated theoretically. Because of its small size, the acoustic
   trachea must not be treated as an infinite exponential horn but its
   transmission function must be calculated by means of the equations for a
   finite-length horn. The finite horn amplifies sound from a certain
   frequency on (cutoff frequency) in a broad range of frequencies as the
   infinite horn does. But the broadbanded transmission is superposed by a
   few resonances which are caused by reflections inside the horn.
   Bioacoustical measurements were made with a probe microphone. As
   expected from the theoretical considerations the course of die measured
   transmission, function corresponds much better with the one calculated
   for the finite exponential horn than with the one, calculated for the
   infinite horn. The present results are discussed referring to the
   consequences of the transmission properties of the acoustic trachea for
   the hearing ability of Tettigoniids. Additionally, they are compared
   with other investigations concerning the function of the acoustic
   trachea in tettigoniid hearing. (C) 1995 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{Replication of bovine papillomavirus requires two viral proteins, E1 and
   E2-TA. Previously we demonstrated that sequences within an imperfect
   18-bp inverted repeat (IR) element were sufficient to confer specific
   binding of the E1 protein to the origin region (S. E. Holt, G. Schuller,
   and V. G. Wilson, J. Virol. 68:1094-1102, 1994). To identify critical
   nucleotides for E1 binding and origin function, a series of individual
   point mutations was constructed at each nucleotide position in the 18-bp
   IR. Binding of E1 to these point mutations established that both the
   position of the mutation and the specific nucleotide change were
   important for the E1-DNA interaction. Equivalent mutations from each
   half of the IR exhibited similar binding, suggesting that the halves
   were functionally symmetric for E1 interactions. Each of these mutations
   was evaluated also for origin function in vivo by a
   transient-replication assay. No single point mutation eliminated
   replication capacity completely, though many mutants were severely
   impaired, demonstrating an important functional contribution for the E1
   binding site. Furthermore, E1 binding was not sufficient for
   replication, as several origin mutants bound E1 well in vitro but
   replicated poorly in vivo. This suggests that certain nucleotides within
   the 18-bp IR may be involved in postbinding events necessary for
   replication initiation. The results with the point mutations suggest
   that E1-E1 interactions are important for stable complex formation and
   also indicate that there is some flexibility with regard to formation of
   a functional E1 replication complex at the origin.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology of linear polyethylene, crystallized from a sheared melt
   in the form of shish-kebabs, has been investigated by transmission
   electron microscopy following permanganic etching. The microstructure of
   lamellae crystallized transversely on a central linear thread changes
   systematically with crystallization temperature and shear rate. Higher
   strain rate produces more and longer filaments and aligns lamellar
   normals along their rows. At lower strain rate, lamellar habits
   resemble, but differ from, those characteristic of quiescent growth.
   Fold surfaces that are inclined to the chain axis c at lower shear rates
   become normal to c with higher shear, thereby adopting a state of higher
   energy. It is inferred from this and the high crystallization
   temperatures that their crystallization was not strain-free. The
   separation of adjacent lamellae and its decrease at higher strain rate
   are consistent with pressure from molecular cilia emerging from fold
   surfaces, in a similar way to the basic cause of lamellar divergence in

Abstract = {{Gene frequencies in samples of aerial populations of barley powdery
   mildew (Erysiphe graminis f.sp. hordei), which were collected in
   adjacent barley areas and in successive periods of time, were compared
   using mobile and stationary sampling techniques. Stationary samples were
   collected from trap plants in three periods within 1 week at a distance
   of more than 1000 m from the nearest barley field. At four dates within
   the same 8-day period, other samples were collected by a mobile spore
   trap along four sampling routes of a total distance of 130 km around the
   stationary stand of exposure. The samples were characterized by
   virulence genotypes defined according to infection types on 12
   near-isogenic barley lines, and frequencies of single virulence genes
   were subsequently calculated. The three samples collected at the
   stationary site differed significantly with respect to allele
   frequencies at three loci. The main wind direction was different in the
   three sampling periods, implying different powdery mildew sources. For
   the mobile exposure, the differences between routes were not significant
   for any locus. However, the routes differed most for the loci under
   direct selection by host resistances genes, indicating a different
   distribution of source varieties along routes. There was no difference
   between allele frequencies at different dates, indicating that the
   proportions of spores from different source varieties were similar at
   these dates. In conclusion, samples collected by the stationary
   technique will mainly reflect the source varieties present in the local
   area, whereas samples collected by the mobile spore trap will mainly
   reflect sources close to the sampling route. Therefore, sampling sites
   as well as sampling routes should be defined such that source varieties
   are representative for the overall varietal distribution in the survey
   region considered.}},

Abstract = {{The microbiological and sensory evaluation of newly-developed cereal
   amaranth-based products (snacks and crackers) during the six-month
   storage in laboratory conditions (20 +/- 2 degrees C, RH = 62 +/- 1\%)
   were studied. Besides the quantitative evaluation (aerobic mesophilic
   bacteria, aerobic sporogenic bacteria, coliform bacteria, yeasts and
   moulds) of final products and basic raw-materials used for their
   production the experimental works involved also the identification of
   the respective microflora.
   The microbiological control confirmed no presence of microorganisms in
   more than 50\% of the basic raw-material samples; in the rest of the
   samples the aerobic mesophilic bacteria ranged between 10(2)-10(3)
   CFU/g; sporulants were detected only in 4 samples (dried milk, amaranth
   grain, cocoa powder and caraway); the number of moulds ranged between
   10-10(3) CFU/g; yeasts and coliform bacteria were not found in any of
   the samples investigated.
   The microbiological quality of snacks and crackers was unchanged up to
   the fifth month of storage; after this time an increase in the aerobic
   mesophilic bacteria (10-10(3) CFU/g) and aerobic sporogenic bacteria
   (10(2)-10(3) CFU/g) was observed.
   The sensory quality of snack and crackers was kept at a high standard
   level during the whole time of storage.}},

   effectiveness of this immunoconjugate (IC) in the destruction of OCM431
   human uveal melanoma cells in vitro. RPMI1846 melanoma cells do not
   react with IC and were used as non-target cells. For control, target and
   non-target cells were treated with IC or light alone. The effects of IC
   and free CMA in the destruction of melanoma cells were compared. Cell
   survival was assessed by a colorimetric assay using tetrazolium salt
   MTT. Target (OCM431) cells preincubated with IC and irradiated with 5-40
   J cm(-2) showed light dose-dependent decrease in cell survival. At 40 J
   cm(-2), OCM431 cells preincubated with IC showed only 6 +/- 1.4\%
   viability. Under same treatment, non-target (RPMI1846) cells showed much
   less phototoxicity; cell survival was 54 +/- 2.1\%. Treatment with free
   CMA and light at 40 J cm(-2) showed similar phototoxicity to both target
   and non-target cells, with cell survival being 24.3 +/- 3.5\% and 23.7
   +/- 1.5\%, respectively. These results show that our IC is effective in
   causing photodestruction of human uveal melanoma cells in vitro. The
   phototoxicity is selective and more potent than free CMA. (C) 1995

Title = {{THE RESPONSE OF AN OCEAN GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL TO SURFACE WIND
   STRESS PRODUCED BY AN ATMOSPHERIC GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL}},
Journal = {{MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW}},

Abstract = {{Two surface wind stress datasets for 1979-91, one based on observations
   and the other from an integration of the COLA atmospheric general
   circulation model (AGCM) with prescribed SST. are used to drive the GFDL
   ocean general circulation model. These two runs are referred to as the
   control and COLA experiments, respectively. Simulated SST and
   upper-ocean heat contents (HC) in the tropical Pacific Ocean are
   compared with observations and between experiments.
   Both simulations reproduced the observed mean SST and HC Gelds as well
   as their annual cycles realistically. Major errors common to both runs
   are colder than observed SST in the eastern equatorial ocean and HC in
   the western Pacific south of the equator, with errors generally larger
   in the COLA experiment. New errors arising from the AGCM wind forcing
   include higher SST near the South American coast throughout the year and
   weaker HC gradients along the equator in boreal spring. The former is
   associated with suppressed coastal upwelling by weak alongshore AGCM
   winds, and the latter is caused by weaker equatorial easterlies in
   boreal spring.
   The low-frequency ENSO fluctuations are also realistic for both runs.
   Correlations between the observed and simulated SST anomalies from the
   COLA simulation are as high as those from the control rin in the central
   equatorial Pacific. A major problem in the COLA simulation is the
   appearance of unrealistic tropical cold anomalies during the boreal
   spring of mature El Nino years. These anomalies propagate along the
   equator from the western Pacific to the eastern coast in about three
   months, and temporarily eliminate the warm SST and HC anomalies in the
   eastern Pacific. This erroneous oceanic response in the COLA simulation
   is caused by a reversal of the westerly wind anomalies on the equator,
   associated with an unrealistic southward shift of the ITCZ in boreal
   spring during El Nino events.
   In both experiments, the annual cycle of the upper equatorial ocean
   (upper 45 m) is dominated by the annual change of surface heat flux and
   advection with its vertical and horizontal components dominant in the
   eastern and central Pacific, respectively. The El Nino development, on
   the other hand, is mainly due to advection of anomalous zonal current in
   the west, the meridional advection in the central, and the displacement
   of thermocline in the east Pacific. The weakening of the warm anomalies
   in COLA in the middle of major warm events corresponds to changes of all
   these processes. The implication of the results derived from this study
   to the coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of historical documents indicates that some notions of
   disinfection, sterilization and preservation procedures were known from
   ancient times. These documents included explorers' accounts of the
   lifestyle of cultures without a written history. Although the
   discoveries were empirical, they were based on shrewd observation.
   Eighteenth and nineteenth century landmarks in the use of disinfection,
   sterilization and preservation techniques include a patent for the use
   of tar to preserve ships' timbers granted in 1716. Eau de Javel, the
   first hypochlorite, was described in 1774, and a food sterilization
   process, appertization, was invented in 1810. In the field of radiation
   sterilization it is surprising that within one or two years after the
   discovery of radioactivity, 1879, and X-rays, 1895, these phenomena were
   being examined for their effect on micro-organisms and were found to be
   lethal. The component of light which was lethal was found to reside in
   the ultra-violet region of the spectrum. This was published in 1903.
   Thus the ideas which gave rise to ultra-violet sterilization, Co-60
   radiation and particle accelerated sterilization were known by the end
   of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. A seminal
   paper on disinfection dynamics appeared in 1897. Mode of action studies
   made a serious start at the beginning of this century. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To quantify dynamic enhancement of breast lesions with
   echo-planar and conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, to
   correlate these data with histologic findings and vessel density, and to
   evaluate the effect of T1 values on enhancement data.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty female patients with 22 breast lesions
   underwent conventional and echo-planar MR imaging. T1 values, change in
   gadopentetate dimeglumine concentration, and extraction-flow products
   were calculated with echo-planar imaging data and were correlated with
   histologic findings and microvessel density.
   RESULTS: T1 values of cancers were not statistically significantly
   shorter. Cancers had more rapid uptake and higher extraction-flow
   products (P < .02). Sensitivity was 86\% and specificity was 93\% for
   diagnosis of malignancy. Microvessel density was higher far malignant
   lesions (P < .02) with an overall positive (not statistically
   significant) correlation between extraction-flow product and microvessel
   density.
   CONCLUSION Echo-planar imaging appears promising for quantification of
   breast lesion enhancement. Microvessel data indicate that tumor
   angiogenesis affects enhancement.}},

   derive the kinematics and the radial extension of the circumstellar
   disk-like plasma. Based on line profile derivatives, we present a new
   method, the separation of the inflection points (SIP), to resolve the
   convolved peaks of H alpha winebottle-type profiles. The newly derived
   peak positions are used to determine H alpha emission disk radii and
   mean optical line depths along the line of sight. We find that these
   improved H alpha disk radii are smaller and closer to Fe Ir disk radii
   than those H alpha disk radii derived from pure peak separations. We
   find evidence that class 2 profiles originate from quasi-Keplerian disks

   pressure pore solution extrusion device and analysed for chloride and
   hydroxyl ion concentrations. Threshold chloride for onset of
   reinforcement corrosion was computed using threshold {[}Cl-/OH-] ratio
   of 0.3. The results showed that C(3)A content and exposure temperature
   have very strong influence on threshold chloride content. Alkali content
   of cement has marginal effect whereas presence of sulfates along with
   chlorides has moderate effect on the threshold chloride content.}},

   histologic variation among the tumors. One case was focally
   hypercellular around the blood vessels, two were more densely cellular
   throughout, and one had cystic degeneration. Three of the tumors were
   widely infiltrative, and one of the four tumors recurred locally. The
   clinicopathologic features of these cases are similar to those of AAM
   occurring in females. In either sex, AAM should be distinguished from
   benign myxoid tumors with a low risk of local recurrence and fully
   malignant myxoid tumors with distant metastatic potential.}},

Abstract = {{The antiepileptic drug, felbamate, was tested in a rat model of painful

   Intraperitoneal doses of 150, 300 and 600 mg/kg were given to animals
   with established heat-hyperalgesia, mechanohyperalgesia,
   mechano-allodynia and signs of spontaneous pain (hindpaw guarding).
   Postinjection tests were conducted 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h later, The 150
   mg/kg dose had little or no effect on any measure. Significant
   reductions in all measures of abnormal pain were seen after the 300 and
   600 mg/kg doses; relief lasted 2 to 12 h. Side effects were trivial or
   absent by 2 h postinjection. Felbamate's actions were generally
   antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic, rather than analgesic, in that the
   responsiveness of the control (sham-operated) hindpaw was unaffected, We
   conclude that felbamate suppresses neuropathic pain sensations and that
   its effectiveness may be due to multiple mechanisms of action. The
   recently discovered severe side-effect liability of felbamate is likely
   to preclude its clinical application.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND purpose of this study is to investigate whether rapid
   spontaneous diminution of cisternal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
   alleviates vasospasm in the corresponding arterial territory,
   METHODS The subjects were 103 patients in whom initial computed
   tomography scans were performed within 24 hours after SAH and repeated
   within 72 hours. We analyzed the effect of diminution of cisternal SAH
   on vasospasm in 16 sites in each patient. Of the total 1642 cisterns,
   SAH was found in 1362 (83\%), of which 539 (40\%) had a decrease in SAH.
   The highest diminution rate was 64\% in quadrigeminal cistern, and the
   lowest rate was 27\% in frontal interhemispheric fissure (IHF). In basal
   frontal IHF, both the incidence of diminution of SAH and its degree were
   significantly lower in patients with ruptured anterior cerebral artery
   aneurysms than in those with other site aneurysms, while in suprasellar
   cisterns, sylvian stems, and sylvian fissures, diminution of SAH was not
   affected by the side of ruptured aneurysms. The diminution of SAH in
   basal frontal IHF and sylvian stems was associated with less vasospasm
   in adjacent arteries.
   CONCLUSIONS We concluded that in patients with SAH, rapid spontaneous
   diminution of cisternal blood, which is affected by several factors,
   makes vasospasm in the corresponding arterial territory less likely.}},

Abstract = {{The liquid-crystalline transformation behavior during continuous cooling
   and the transformation-induced structure were examined for a
   Zr60Al10Ni10Cu15Pd5 molten alloy which was ejected into a wedge-shape
   cavity in a copper mold. The wedge-shape cavity has a constant depth of
   50 mm and different vertical angles (theta) ranging from 5 to 15
   degrees. The ejection temperature of the molten alloy was also changed
   in the range of 1273 to 1573 K. The cast structure consists only of a
   glassy phase in the theta range smaller than 10 degrees and changes to a
   mixed structure consisting of glassy and nonequilibrium crystalline
   Zr2Ni and Zr2Cu phases in the higher theta range. The glass transition
   temperature and crystallization temperature of the cast metal glass are
   683 and 778 K, respectively, which agree with those for the melt-spun
   glassy ribbon. The start (Cs) and termination (Ct) points for the
   transformation from the supercooled liquid to crystalline phases during
   continuous cooling were determined from the thermal analytical data
   obtained at different sites in the wedge-shape cavity and the
   continuous-cooling-transformation (C.C.T.) curves were constructed. The
   nose temperature (T-n) and the time (t(n)) up to the nose point in the
   C.C.T. curves were 1018 K and 0.93 s respectively. The critical cooling
   rate for glass formation defined by (T-m - T-n)/t(n) is evaluated to be
   110 K/s. Further, the time interval between Cs and Ct is as short as 0.2
   s and the fast growth reaction is attributed to the easy formation of
   the nonequilibrium crystalline phases and the increase in temperature
   caused by the precipitation-induced recalescence.}},

Abstract = {{The article is concerned with blank development when deep drawing
   nonaxisymmetric, prismatic cups with a flat bottomed punch. Two
   processes are considered, one of which is the calculation of optimum
   blank shapes when deep drawing square cups; here `'optimum'' means that
   the cups have essentially a flat top after the drawing process. The
   second process is to design a blank such that the finished component is
   a partially drawn cylindrical cup possessing a square flange of some
   specified dimensions. An inverse finite-element technique was developed
   to perform the analysis for calculating the blank shapes. In addition to
   blank shapes, it was possible to predict the limiting drawing ratios,
   the maximum draw depth and the drawing load. Although the entire drawing
   process is not modeled, it is possible to assess the influence of
   certain processing parameters such as blank shape, the coefficient of
   friction, blank holder force, and die radius on the drawing force and
   limiting drawing ratio. Some of the theoretical predictions for the
   limiting blank size in deep drawing square cups from optimum-shaped

   transistors (HBT's) have been demonstrated for the first time. We have
   observed that the current gains of HBT's fabricated on the same wafer
   are strongly dependent on the emitter direction. The HBT's with emitter
   direction of {[}010] show the highest current gain and the smallest
   emitter-size effect. This orientation effect could be attributed to the
   piezoelectric effect, which superposes the piezoelectric charges to the
   original emitter doping and generates the weak lateral electric field
   that drifts the injected carriers at the emitter periphery. The
   difference of the saturation voltage between collector-emitter of those
   HBT's corresponds to the superposed piezoelectric charges.}},

Abstract = {{Escherichia coli TUH12191, which is resistant to piperacillin,
   cefazolin, cefotiam, ceftizoxime, cefuzonam, and aztreonam but is
   susceptible to cefoxitin, latamoxef, flomoxef, and imipenem, was
   isolated from the urine of a patient treated with beta-lactam
   antibiotics. The beta-lactamase (Toho-1) purified from the bacteria had
   a pI of 7.8, had a molecular weight of about 29,000, and hydrolyzed
   beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin G, ampicillin, oxacillin,
   carbenicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, cephaloridine, cefoxitin,
   cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. Toho-1 was markedly inhibited by
   beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid and tazobactam.
   Resistance to beta-lactams, streptomycin, spectinomycin,
   sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim was transferred by conjugational
   transfer from E. coli TUH12191 to E. coli ML4903, and the transferred
   plasmid was about 58 kbp, belonging to incompatibility group M. The
   cefotaxime resistance gene for Toho-1 was subcloned from the 58-kbp
   plasmid by transformation of E. coli MV1184. The sequence of the gene
   for Toho-1 was determined, and the open reading frame of the gene
   consisted of 873 or 876 bases (initial sequence, ATGATG). The nucleotide
   sequence of the gene (DDBJ accession number D37830) was found to be
   about 73\% homologous to the sequence of the gene encoding a class A
   beta-lactamase produced by Klebsiella oxytoca E23004. According to the
   amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence, the precursor
   consisted of 290 or 291 amino acid residues, which contained amino acid
   motifs common to class A beta-lactamases ((70)SXXK, (SDN)-S-130, and
   (234)KTG). Toho-1 was about 83\% homologous to the beta-lactamase
   mediated by the chromosome of K. oxytoca D488 and the beta-lactamase
   mediated by the plasmid of E. coli MEN-1. Therefore, the newly isolated
   beta-lactamase Toho-1 produced by E. coli TUH12191 is similar to
   beta-lactamases produced by K. oxytoca D488, K. oxytoca E23004, and E.
   coli MEN-1 rather than to mutants of TEM or SHV enzymes. Toho-1 has
   shown the highest degree of similarity to K. oxytoca class A
   beta-lactamase. Detailed comparison of Toho-1 with other beta-lactamases
   implied that replacement of Asn-276 by Arg with the concomitant
   substitution of Thr for Arg-244 is an important mutation in the
   extension of the substrate specificity.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that leukotoxin (Lx), a cytochrome
   P-450-dependent linoleate product of leukocytes, can stimulate the
   release of endothelin-1 (ET-1) from the lung and further that exogenous
   ET-1 synergizes with Lx to produce edematous lung injury. In isolated
   rat lungs perfused with Earle's balanced salt solution, Lx (10 mu mol)
   alone caused lung edema and increased the perfusate and lung tissue ET-1
   levels. The combination of ET-1 (5 nM) and Lx (5 mu mol), at
   concentrations that by themselves did not increase wet lung weight,
   significantly increased wet lung weight, wet-to-dry lung weight ratio,
   as well as the lung effluent lactate dehydrogenase activity.
   Pretreatment with BQ-123 (5 x 10(-6) M), an endothelin A receptor
   antagonist that significantly attenuated the ET-1 (5 nM)-induced
   increase in pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and pulmonary capillary
   pressure (Ppc), suppressed the edematous lung injury generated by the
   combination of ET-1 and Lx, suggesting that the edema-enhancing effect
   of ET-1 in Lx-treated lungs occurred through endothelin A
   receptor-dependent elevation of Ppa and Ppc. Elevation of the pulmonary
   venous pressure in Lx-treated lungs (13.5 cmH(2)O) mimicked the effect
   of ET-1 on Ppa and Ppc and produced a degree of lung edema that was
   comparable to that after combined ET-1 + Lx treatment but without
   increase in the perfusate lactate dehydrogenase. These data support the
   idea that ET-1 and Lx promote lung edema in a synergistic fashion.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the role of retinoic acid (RA) in mouse neural crest
   cell development in culture. We have compared the effects of RA on the
   developmental behavior of mouse neural crest cells from different axial
   levels, that is the mesencephalic (cranial) and sympathoadrenal (trunk)
   levels by colony assay using antibodies against cell-type-specific
   markers. In control cultures in the absence of RA, the efficiency of
   colony formation by cranial neural crest cells was considerably lower
   than in colony cultures of trunk neural crest cells. Pulse-labelling
   experiments using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) showed that the
   proportion of neural crest cells that incorporated BrdU was
   significantly smaller in day 5 cultures of cranial neural crest cells in
   the absence of RA compared to cultures from the trunk level. However,
   BrdU-incorporation matched the labelling observed in trunk crest cell
   cultures when RA was added to the culture medium, The efficiency of
   colony formation and the proportion of BrdU-incorporated cells in trunk
   crest cell cultures was similar in the presence and absence of RA. The
   results suggest that in the early stages of in vitro development, RA has
   a larger impact on proliferation and/or survival of cranial neural crest
   cells than of trunk neural crest cells, Moreover, the data indicate that
   RA significantly affects melanogenesis and the differentiation of
   serotonergic neurons in mouse neural crest cell cultures from both axial
   levels, Whereas melanogenesis was suppressed by RA treatment,
   serotonergic neurogenesis was promoted. Double-labelling experiments
   with antibodies against BrdU and serotonin (5-HT) indicated that RA
   selectively promoted proliferation of these neurons at a later stage of
   in vitro development. Furthermore, RA acted upon both committed cells
   and multipotent cells. Based on the results, we conclude that RA plays
   multiple critical roles in mouse neural crest cell development. (C) 1995

   to execute these concurrent objects sufficiently efficient, we use a
   combination of dedicated system service layers and other implementation
   techniques. System service layers provide the most suitable primitive
   operations for each concurrent object. Under our programming model for
   low-level system code, which we call SCONE, it is possible to program
   low-level system code without hazardous operations such as explicit
   synchronization, direct scheduler manipulation, etc. We present the
   implementation of our methodology on the Apertos operating system and
   demonstrate its efficiency with performance evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Factors controlling the acidity of running waters between the coast of

   SO42- was between 11-22 mu eq m(-2) y(-1), of which 93\% was nonmarine,
   with the highest values in the coastal region. Organic anions were the
   most frequent acid anions in the whole investigation area followed by
   sulfate. The major portion of SO42- was from natural sources in the
   whole investigation area. The most acidic streams occurred in the hilly
   wave-washed terrain of the coastal region, because of a high terrestrial
   export of organic acids and very low neutralizing capacity. It is
   concluded that most of the acidity in the investigated streams is due to

Abstract = {{Objective. A patient's medical condition can affect the delivery of
   dental care. Medical consultation is indicated for dental patients whose
   medical history is uncertain or when physical assessment may indicate an
   untreated medical problem. The aims of this study were to evaluate the
   use of medical consultation and determine how it affects dental
   treatment plans in a predoctoral dental clinic program.
   Study design. Reviews of 147 medical consultation requests were
   performed.
   Results. The main reasons for medical consultations were cardiovascular
   assessment (51.5\%) and diabetic status determination (12.6\%). In the
   cardiovascular assessment category, hypertension (48.1\%) and heart
   murmur (17.9\%) were primary concerns. Main dental concerns were the
   need for preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (33.3\%) and the use of
   vasoconstrictors (20.4\%). Overall, 32.1\% of medical consultations
   resulted in an alteration in dental treatment plans. As a result of
   medical consultations, 8\% commenced their medical management.
   Conclusions. These results indicated that medical consultations could
   reduce the medical risk associated with dental procedures and
   unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis. Therefore for many dental patients,
   good communication between dentists and physicians is essential for
   adequate care.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Mitochondrial cytopathies such as Leber's hereditary optic
   neuropathy (LHON), mitochondrial encephalo-myopathy with lactic acidosis
   and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and myocionus epilepsy with red ragged
   fibers (MERRF) are associated with distinct mtDNA point mutations (for
   review see 1). LHON, for example, is related to at least 14 mtDNA point
   mutations within different mitochondrially encoded respiratory subunit
   genes. In addition, the number of newly found LHON-related mutations is
   increasing. In the light of the large number and the dispersed
   distribution of these point mutations throughout the mitochondrial
   genome, screening for these by sequencing all of suspected loci is
   laborious and time-consuming. In order to facilitate a rapid screening
   for mitochondrial point mutations we have evaluated the use of
   polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism
   (PCR-SSCP) for the analysis of the human mitochondrial genome.
   Design and Methods: In a first evaluation step we created a variety of
   pUC18 clones derived from mitochondrial control region amplifications
   with defined sequence differences and length. These clones were used as
   standard material for an optimization of the PCR-SSCP analysis. The
   optimized PCR-SSCP was then applied to large cohorts of patients with
   known, i.e., sequenced mtDNA point mutations and to healthy controls in
   order to evaluate its sensitivity.
   Results: The most common LHON-related mtDNA point mutations at
   nucleotide positions (nps) 11778, 14484, 4216, could be detected by SSCP
   analysis, as well as the heteroplasmic np 3243 MELAS associated point
   mutation. Several new polymorphisms and point mutations were found. A
   sensitivity, i.e., the ability to detect defined point mutations, of
   93\% (clones) at 98\% (disease controls) was achieved when comparing
   SSCP- and direct sequencing results.
   Conclusion: The PCR-SSCP approach using a non-radioactive silver
   staining method is suited for the detection of human mitochondrial point
   mutations, as well as helpful screening tool for novel mt DNA mutations.}},

Abstract = {{We extend to continuous groups our recent results on strongly
   approximately transitive group actions. We are concerned with locally
   compact second countable groups and standard Borel G-spaces. A G-space
   chi with a sigma-finite quasiinvariant measure alpha is called strongly
   approximately transitive (SAT) if there exists a probability measure nu
   much less than alpha such for every Borel set A with alpha(A) not equal
   0 and every epsilon > 0 one can find g epsilon G with v(gA) > 1 -
   epsilon. Examples of SAT G-spaces include boundaries of spread out
   random walks on G. We prove that when G is compactly generated and has
   polynomial growth then every standard SAT G-space (chi, alpha) is
   necessarily purely atomic; when G is additionally connected, (chi,alpha)
   is a singleton. The Choquet-Deny theorem for spread out random walks on
   G follows as a corollary. For a connected G we establish the equivalence
   of the following conditions: (a) G has polynomial growth; (b) every
   standard SAT G-space is a singleton; (c) every SAT homogeneous space of
   G is a singleton; (d) every homogeneous space of G admits a sigma-finite

   every absolutely continuous compactly supported probability measure on

Abstract = {{From January 1990 to February 1994, 400 patients (mean age 59 +/- 9
   years) underwent myocardial revascularization using the right
   gastroepiploic artery (GEA) to bypass the right coronary artery trunk or
   branches. They represented 40\% of all patients undergoing isolated
   coronary surgery during the same period, from 19\% in 1990 to 54\% in
   1994. Left ventricular function was normal in 32\% of patients,
   moderately impaired in 62\% and severely impaired in 6\%. The GEA was
   used alone in six patients, associated with one internal mammary artery
   (IMA) in 111 patients (two arterial grafts, 2.2+/-0.4 anastomoses) and
   with both IMAs in 283 patients (three arterial grafts, 3.4 +/- 0.6
   anastomoses); no vein graft was used. The rate of complete myocardial
   revascularization was 79\%. Early mortality was 1.7\% and influenced by
   left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.05). Complications occurred in
   37 patients: myocardial infarction 4\%, intra-aortic balloon pump 0.5\%,
   reoperation for bleeding 0.5\%, mediastinitis 0.25\%. Early (15th
   postoperative day) angiographic control of the GEA graft was performed
   in 104 patients operated from January 1990 to December 1991 and the
   patency rate was 92\%; anomalies of GEA were three occlusions, five
   stenoses, three competitive flow, no string or slender sign. Early
   functional results (3 +/- 1 months postoperatively) were studied in 192
   patients during exercise test with medical treatment: 99\% were
   symptom-free and 14\% had electrocardiographic (EGG) ischemic
   modification significantly correlated with incomplete revascularization
   (P<0.01). The 2- and 4-year actuarial survival rate was 96.7 +/- 1.9\%.
   The rate of late cardiac events was 2\% patient/year; Angioplasty for
   GEA graft failure was required in four patients. A 2-year postoperative
   functional assessment without medical treatment was performed during
   exercise test in 66 patients who had received three arterial grafts:
   98\% were symptom-free and 26\% had ECG ischemic modification
   significantly correlated with incomplete revascularization (P<0.01);
   during the same procedure, thallium myocardial scintigraphy was obtained
   in 50 patients: 18 patients (36\%) had asymptomatic ischemic defects on
   exercise significantly correlated with incomplete revascularization and
   ECG ischemic changes (P<0.01). However, posterior thallium defects
   demonstrated limited GEA flow at the maximum level of exercise in at
   least 8\% of patients. Myocardial revascularization using the GEA can be
   achieved with minimal operative risk and offers satisfactory functional
   results and midterm survival rate.}},

Abstract = {{The problems of finding shortest common supersequences (SCS) and longest
   common subsequences (LCS) are two well-known NP-hard problems that have
   applications in many areas, including computational molecular biology,
   data compression, robot motion planning, and scheduling, text editing,
   etc. A lot of fruitless effort has been spent in searching for good
   approximation algorithms for these problems. In this paper, we show that
   these problems are inherently hard to approximate in the worst case. In
   particular, we prove that (i) SCS does not have a polynomial-rime linear
   approximation algorithm unless P = NP; (ii) There exists a constant
   delta > 0 such that, if SCS has a polynomial-time approximation
   algorithm with ratio log(delta) n, where ii is the number of input
   sequences, then NP is contained in DTIME((2Polylog) (n));(iii) There
   exists a constant delta > 0 such that, if LCS has a polynomial-time
   approximation algorithm with performance ratio n(d)elta, then P = NP.
   The proofs utilize the recent results of Arora et al. {[}Proc. 23rd IEEE
   Symposium oil Foundations of Computer Science, 1992, pp. 14-23] on the
   complexity of approximation problems.
   In the second part of the paper, we introduce a new method for analyzing
   the average-case performance of algorithms for sequences, based on
   Kolmogorov complexity. Despite the above nonapproximability results, we
   show that near optimal solutions for both SCS and LCS can be found on
   the average. More precisely, consider a fixed alphabet Sigma and suppose
   that the input sequences are generated randomly according to the uniform
   probability distribution and are of the same length n. Moreover, assume
   that the number of input sequences is polynomial in n. Then, there are
   simple greedy algorithms which approximate SCS and LCS with expected
   additive errors O(n(0.707)) and O(n(1/2+epsilon)) for epsilon > 0,
   respectively.
   Incidentally, our analyses also provide tight upper and lower bounds on
   the expected LCS and SCS lengths for a set of random sequences solving a
   generalization of another well-known open question on the expected LCS
   length for two random sequences {[}K. Alexander, The rare of convergence

Abstract = {{In non-stoichiometric oxides (NiO, CoO, Cu-2 O...) two thermodynamic
   parameters (temperature T and partial pression of oxygen P-O2) are
   necessary in order to fix the population of point defects. When one of
   these two parameters (T or P-O2) is suddenly changed and a physical
   property is continuously recorded, a `'transient'' can be observed due
   to the diffusion of the point defects in order to reach the new
   thermodynamic equilibrium population. Many works have been devoted to
   the majority point defects (non-stoichiometry). In this paper we present
   an overview about the high temperature transitory plastic deformation
   which is related with the minority point defects.}},

Abstract = {{We studied 34 patients in remission of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by
   performing clonal analysis of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear (PMN)
   cells and mononuclear (MN) cells, using X-linked DNA polymorphisms, in
   conjunction with the assessment of morphological myelodysplastic
   changes, performed by a scoring method. Nine patients demonstrated a
   non-random or skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern in PMN cells.
   Three of these nine patients had an apparently random pattern in MN
   cells (group A), whereas the remaining six patients demonstrated no
   difference between the inactivation patterns of PMN and MN cells (group
   B). The PMN cells of the other 25 patients showed a random X-chromosome
   inactivation pattern, and the patterns of the PMN cells did not differ
   from those of the MN cells (group C). The scores for myelodysplasia were
   high (greater than or equal to 4) in all three patients in group A,
   intermediate (2-3) in two patients and low (score <2) in four patients
   in group B, and intermediate in five patients and low in 20 patients in
   group C. The duration of remission in patients with a myelodysplasia
   score of greater than or equal to 2 was significantly shorter than that
   of patients with a score of <2 (P < 0.01). We conclude that clonal
   remission actually occurs with myelodysplastic features in some patients
   with AML (around 10\%, group A). It is possible that this clonal
   analysis may not be sensitive enough to detect the preleukemic clone
   with myelodysplastic features when this clone constitutes only a minor
   population of remission hematopoiesis. To further elucidate the biology
   of such preleukemic clones it is essential to develop more sensitive
   molecular methods for the detection of genetic abnormalities specific to
   preleukemic hematopoiesis.}},

Abstract = {{The late Pleistocene Animas City 2 and Animas City 3 end moraines at the
   north edge of Durango, Colorado, were built at the terminus of the
   Animas glacier as ice-marginal aprons of primarily debris-flow sediment
   interbedded with sandy stream sediment. Sorted sediment and three types
   of diamicton present in the moraines are interpreted as fluvial
   sediment, lacustrine sediment, debris-flow sediment, and melt-out till.
   Melt-out till at one locality represents deposition from the basal,
   debris-rich parts of the Animas glacier onto the proximal side of the
   Animas City 3 moraine. Glaciotectonic features in a coarsening-upward
   sequence of sediment, previously deposited in a proglacial
   moraine-dammed lake, mark a readvance of the Animas glacier to the
   Animas City 3 moraine.
   Based on the character of the sediments and their interbedding, we
   conclude that the existing moraines were built rapidly (in <10 yr to a
   few tens of years), immediately before the glacier retreated from the
   terminus position. Earlier moraine ridges would have been built
   continuously at the ice margin, but continuously removed by laterally
   migrating outwash streams. That the glacier stood at the terminus
   position for a long time is indicated not by the moraines, but by the
   extensive outwash deposits to the south and by the geomorphic constraint
   that coarse sediment could only be delivered to the river south of the
   moraine position when the ice was at the terminus position; otherwise,
   the large, scoured bedrock basin north of the moraine ridges would have
   acted as a sediment trap.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary copper deficiency severely reduces platelet cytochrome c oxidase

   metabolism is unknown. In this study, the effect of copper deficiency on
   platelet adenine nucleotide and GTP content was determined. Structural
   changes in platelet mitochondria during copper deficiency also were
   examined. Copper deficiency caused a 24\% reduction in adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP) content, a 113\% increase in adenosine monophosphate
   (AMP) content, and a 36\% reduction in GTP content. Because the
   secretary pool of ATP was not affected by copper deficiency, the changes
   observed in platelet nucleotide content most likely reflect an effect on
   the metabolic nucleotide pool. Furthermore, the number of platelet
   mitochondria exhibiting swollen cristae and high matrical density,
   characteristics suggesting that mitochondria ave engaged in oxidative
   phosphorylation, was increased by copper deficiency. These findings
   indicate that copper deficiency can alter energy metabolism in platelets
   in a manner that is consistent with partial blockage of mitochondrial

Abstract = {{The present paper provides evidence that spinach chloroplasts possess a
   sulphite oxidase activity coupled with oxygen consumption and reduction
   of ferricyanide. This activity is associated with thylakoids and
   solubilized by non-ionic biological detergents. The pH and temperature
   dependencies of sulphite oxidase activity solubilized by Triton X-100
   from spinach thylakoids were consistent with those of an intrinsic
   membrane protein. This isolated activity was insensitive towards radical
   scavengers (mannitol, mannose and fructose) and catalase, and was
   inhibited only with very high concentrations of superoxide dismutase.
   Thus, observed sulphite oxidation was not induced through the
   photosynthetic electron transport system, but achieved via a thylakoid
   membrane enzymic system showing a sulphite oxidase activity. Kinetic
   parameters of thylakoid sulphite oxidase were measured and compared with
   those of other sulphite oxidases.}},

Abstract = {{Several recent papers give rigorous justifications of weakly nonlinear
   geometric optics. All of them consider oscillating wave trains on
   domains where focusing phenomena do not exist, either because the space
   dimension is equal to one, or thanks to a coherence assumption on the
   phases. This paper is devoted to a study of some nonlinear effects of
   focusing. In a previous paper, the authors have given a variety of
   examples which show how focusing in nonlinear equations can spoil even
   local existence in the sense that the domain of existence shrinks to
   zero as the wavelength decreases to zero. On the other hand, there are
   many problems for which global existence is known and in those cases it
   is natural to ask what happens to oscillations as they pass through a
   focus. The main goal of this paper is to present such a study for some
   strongly dissipative semilinear wave equations and spherical wavefronts
   which focus at the origin. We show that the strongly nonlinear
   phenomenon which is produced is that oscillations are killed by the
   simultaneous action of focusing and dissipation. Our study relies on the
   analysis of Young measures and two-scale Young measures associated to
   sequences of solutions. The main step is to prove that these measures
   satisfy appropriate transport equations. Then, their variances are shown
   to satisfy differential inequalities which imply a propagation result
   for their support.}},

   chamber and equilibrated for at least an hour with an internal solution
   that contained 20 mM EGTA and phenol red and an external solution that
   contained predominantly TEA-gluconate; both solutions were nominally
   Ca-free. The increase in total myoplasmic concentration of Ca
   (Delta{[}Ca-T]) produced by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release was
   estimated from the change in pH produced when the released Ca was
   complexed by EGTA (Pape, P. C., D.-S. Jong, and W. K. Chandler. 1995.
   Journal of General Physiology. 106:259-336.). The resting value of SR Ca
   content, {[}Ca-SR](R) (expressed as myoplasmic concentration), was taken
   to be equal to the value of Delta{[}Ca-T] obtained during a step
   depolarization (usually to -50 to -40 mV) that was sufficiently long
   (200-750 ms) to release all of the readily releasable Ca from the SR. In
   ten fibers, the first depolarization gave {[}Ca-SR](R) = 839-1,698 mu M.
   Progressively smaller values were obtained with subsequent
   depolarizations until, after 30-40 depolarizations, the value of
   {[}Ca-SR](R) had usually been reduced to <10 mu M Measurements of
   intramembranous charge movement, I-cm, showed that, as the value of
   {[}Ca-SR](R) decreased, ON-OFF charge equality held and the amount of
   charge moved remained constant. ON I-cm showed brief initial I-beta
   components and prominent I-gamma `'humps'', even after the value of
   {[}Ca-SR](R) was <10 mu M. Although the amplitude of the hump component
   decreased during depletion, its duration increased in a manner that
   preserved the constancy of ON charge. In the depleted state, charge
   movement was steeply voltage dependent, with a mean value of 7.2 mV for
   the Boltzmann factor k. These and other results are not consistent with
   the idea that there is one type of charge, Q(beta), and that I-gamma is
   a movement of Q(beta) caused by SR Ca release, as proposed by Pizarro,
   Csernoch, Uribe, Rodriguez, and Rios (1991. Journal of General

Abstract = {{Acoustic plane-wave scattering from a circular aperture in a thick hard
   screen is reexamined. The Hankel transform is applied to express the
   scattered field in the spectral domain and the boundary conditions are
   enforced to obtain simultaneous equations for the transmitted field
   inside the thick hard screen. The simultaneous equations are solved to
   represent the transmitted and scattered fields in series forms.
   Numerical computations are performed To illustrate the behavior of
   scattering and transmission in terms of the aperture size, frequency,
   and incident angle. It is found that scattering from a circular pit
   exhibits the resonance versus the pit depth when the pit radius is
   larger than a wavelength. The numerical comparisons to other available
   data show excellent agreement. The presented series solution is
   numerically efficient and general in that it includes scattering from a
   circular aperture, pit, and semi-infinite pipe altogether. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{The data driven method of selecting the number of components in Neyman's

   of the dimension of the exponential families in applying Schwarz's rule
   is allowed to grow with the number of observations to infinity.
   Simulation results show that the data driven version of Neyman's test
   performs very well for a wide range of alternatives and is competitive
   with other recently introduced (data driven) procedures. It is shown
   that the data driven smooth tests are consistent against essentially all
   alternatives. In proving consistency, new results on Schwarz's selection

Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{To clarify the cause and pathophysiology of hyponatremia after
   intracranial bleeding, we analyzed the possible causative factors, and
   examined the response of vasopressin (AVP) secretion to osmotic stimulus
   in six patients. Despite hyponatremia, urinary sodium excretion
   persisted, with urinary osmolality exceeding plasma osmolality. Serum
   levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid were not elevated in
   any of them. PRA was normal or subnormal in four patients, and all had
   normal adrenocortical and thyroid functions. Although these laboratory
   findings may support the diagnosis of the syndrome of inappropriate
   antidiuretic hormone secretion, the cause of hyponatremia in our
   patients was attributed to excessive renal excretion of sodium, because
   water load performed in an euvolemic state showed no impairment in
   diuresis, and replenishment of sodium without water restriction improved
   hyponatremia as well as clinical conditions. Plasma AVP levels relative
   to plasma osmolality in these patients were constantly elevated. When
   challenged by an osmotic stimulus, AVP secretion increased with
   increasing plasma osmolality in one patient, but no consistent pattern
   of AW secretion was observed in others. The potentiation effect of
   hypovolemia on osmotic secretion of AVP was not demonstrated in ally of
   the patients. These results show that hyponatremia after intracranial
   bleeding with clinical features almost indistinguishable from those of
   syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion may result from
   an impaired renal sodium-conserving mechanism of unknown cause.
   Persistent AVP secretion without an alteration in the sensitivity of the
   osmostat in this pathological State may be due to an incomplete
   suppression by plasma hypotonicity per se of the baroreceptor-mediated
   stimulation of AVP release.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the clinical, histologic, and molecular responses of
   normal human skin to all-trans-retinol (ROL) application, compared to
   those induced by topical all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), and measured
   ROL-derived metabolites. Up to 1.6\% ROL, 0.025\% RA in vehicle (70\%
   ethanol/30\% propylene glycol), or vehicle alone were applied in a
   double-blind fashion to normal buttock skin and occluded for 4 d. ROL
   produced from none to only trace erythema, which was clinically and
   statistically insignificant, whereas RA induced a significant 3.7-fold
   increase in erythema score compared to vehicle (n = 10, p < 0.01).
   However, ROL induced significant epidermal thickening (1.5-fold at 1.6\%
   ROL, p < 0.01), similar to RA (1.6-fold at 0.025\% RA, p < 0.01),
   relative to the vehicle. ROL, compared with vehicle, also increased mRNA
   levels of cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP-II) and cellular
   retinol binding protein (CRBP) genes as determined by Northern analysis
   (5-6-fold and 6-7-fold, respectively) and riboprobe in situ
   hybridization. CRABP-II and CRBP protein levels were also higher
   following ROL than vehicle treatment, as measured by ligand binding
   (3.2-fold, p < 0.001; n = 7) and Western analysis (3.6-fold, p < 0.003;
   n = 6), respectively. Epidermal retinyl ester (RE) content, measured
   after removal of stratum corneum, rose 240-fold (p < 0.005, n = 5) by 24
   h of ROL occlusion. RA content, however, was undetectable or detectable
   only at trace amounts in all samples obtained at 0, 6, 24, and 96 h
   after ROL occlusion. Detectability of RA was not correlated with ROL
   treatment (compared to untreated normal skin, p 0.86) or baseline skin
   ROL levels (average r = -0.1, p > 0.3). These data demonstrate that ROL
   application 1) produces trace erythema not significantly different from
   vehicle, whereas RA causes erythema; 2) induces epidermal thickening and
   enhances expression of CRABP-II and CRBP mRNAs and proteins as does RA;
   3) causes marked accumulation of retinyl ester; and 4) does not
   significantly increase RA levels. Taken together, the data are
   compatible with the idea that ROL may be a prohormone of RA, because it
   produces changes in skin similar to those produced by RA but without
   measurable RA or irritation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Masked allergens in processed foods are sometimes
   responsible for `'idiopathic'' anaphylaxis because of the lack of full
   ingredient labeling. Patients, even if they are aware of a specific
   hypersensitivity, may be unaware of trace amounts of the offending
   allergen(s) that are present in these products.
   Methods: We report a case of severe anaphylaxis to mustard masked in
   `'chicken dips.'' A 38-year-old woman had an anaphylactic reaction
   beginning 20 minutes after eating `'chicken dips'' in a fast food
   restaurant. She was treated successfully in an emergency room and then
   referred to us for evaluation. We performed skin prick tests, IgE
   antibody, and inhibition assays to identify allergens in foods eaten
   just prior to the anaphylactic reaction.
   Results: She had a history of allergy to mustard. Skin prick tests
   revealed sensitivity to mustard, coriander, and curry powder, which
   contains mustard. She had 56.3 KU/L mustard-specific serum IgE antibody
   in a Phadebas CAP PAST assay (Pharmacia, Sweden). The mustard RAST was
   inhibited with an extract of `'chicken dips,'' confirming the presence
   of mustard in `'chicken dips.''
   Conclusions: This case points out the risk of masked allergens in modern
   food products and the value of the RAST inhibition assay for the
   identification of such hidden allergens.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the use of the random amplified
   polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method to detect genetic variation in cattle and
   sheep. The animals studied consisted of samples from five Finnish cattle
   breeds: native Eastern (18 animals), Northern (24), Western Finncattle
   (24), Finnish Ayrshire (24), and Finnish Friesian (18); as well as a
   white (6 animals) and a grey (9) colour type of Finnsheep. The cattle
   and sheep populations were analysed with 11 and 13 RAPD primers
   demonstrating the most repeatable amplification pattern. Two out of ten
   RAPD fragments tested by cross hybridization showed homology between the
   two species. The RAPD method did not prove efficient for finding new
   polymorphisms in either species, because we found only three polymorphic
   RAPD markers for cattle and seven markers for sheep with different
   allele frequencies between the breeds. Although there is a greater
   presence of polymorphic RAPD markers in sheep, according to the
   similarity indices the sheep populations showed a higher degree of
   homogeneity than the cattle breeds. However, the interbreed and
   intrabreed similarity indices for cattle did not suggest any significant
   differentiation of the Finnish breeds, contrary to earlier results based
   on blood group and protein polymorphism.}},

Abstract = {{A straightforward in vivo model of collagen degradation is described
   that can be used to measure the effects of different classes of
   proteinase inhibitors.
   Air pouches, formed subcutaneously in the dorsal thoracic region of
   rats, were inflamed 6 to 8 days later by injecting lambda-type
   carrageenan. C-14-Collagen was injected into the air pouches either 1
   day before or 1 day after lambda-carrageenan-induced inflammation: in
   the latter case, the inflammatory exudate fluid was drained from the air
   pouches immediately prior to administering C-14-collagen. Ninety percent
   of the C-14-collagen was degraded and cleared within 3 days from
   pre-inflamed air pouches, but degradation was much slower from the
   post-inflamed or non-inflamed air pouches.
   Proteinase inhibitors injected simultaneously with the C-14-collagen,
   and again 6 hr later, reduced the extent of C-14-collagen degradation
   from air pouches measured after 24 hr. Forty-two percent of the
   degradation of C-14-collagen could be inhibited by a mixture of enzyme
   inhibitors (leupeptin, alpha(1)-anti-proteinase, aprotinin, and
   pepstatin) injected together with 1,10 phenanthroline, the zinc
   metalloenzyme inhibitor. The 1,10 phenanthroline alone caused a 33\%
   inhibition of C-14-collagen degradation, and the inhibitor mixture given
   alone inhibited C-14-collagen loss by 25\%. Approximately 60\% of the
   degradation of C-14-collagen in this model was mediated by mechanisms
   resistant to this combination of proteinase inhibitors, which may
   indicate the significant involvement of non-enzymic modalities, or
   degradation in intracellular compartments inaccessible to extracellular
   agents.}},

Abstract = {{An artificial neural network of the fuzzy-ARTMAP type was applied for
   predicting strength properties of high-performance concrete (HPC) mixes.
   Composition of HPC was assumed simplified, as a mixture of six
   components (cement, silica, superplasticizer, water, fine aggregate, and
   coarse aggregate). The 28-day compressive strength value was considered
   as the only aim of the prediction. Data on about 340 mixes were taken
   from various recent publications. The system was trained based on 200
   training pairs chosen randomly from the data set, and then tested using
   remaining 140 examples. A significant enough correlation between the
   actual strength values and the values predicted by the neural network
   was observed. Obtained results suggest that the problem of concrete
   properties prediction can be effectively modeled in a neural system, in
   spite of data complexity, incompleteness, and incoherence. It is
   demonstrated that the approach can be used in multicriterial search for
   optimal concrete mixes.}},

Abstract = {{The Societe Internationale de Chirurgie Orthopedique et de Traumatologie
   (SICOT), the Task Force on Outcome Studies of The American Academy of
   Orthopaedic Surgeons, and The Hip Society reached a consensus on the
   nomenclature to be used for the evaluation of the results of total hip
   arthroplasty, The Task Force of The American Academy of Orthopaedic
   Surgeons, to assess the results of total hip arthroplasty from the
   perspective of the patient, subsequently developed a questionnaire that
   incorporated this nomenclature, The validity and reliability data
   regarding this questionnaire are reported in this study,
   Twenty-five patients participated in the reliability test. The
   non-response rate was five (0.5 per cent) of 941 possible responses,
   Test-retest reliability was determined by calculating the Spearman
   correlation coefficients for each question, The coefficients ranged from
   0.41 to 1.0 over a mean test-retest interval of sixteen days, Most items
   had Spearman coefficients that were greater than 0.50, indicating good
   or excellent reliability, Validity was assessed, for the fifty-four
   patients who participated, by calculating the Spearman correlation
   coefficients for the items regarding pain in the affected hip,
   limitation of usual activities, capacity for walking without support,
   and the Sickness Impact Profile, The coefficients ranged from 0.11 (pain
   and limitation of activity) to 0.56 (Sickness Impact Profile and
   limitation of activity), These coefficients reflected modest
   associations, as anticipated, indicating that pain, function, and health
   status are related yet distinct concepts,
   On the basis of the results in this small sample, the Total Hip
   Arthroplasty Outcome Evaluation Questionnaire that was developed by The
   American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons appears to be a valid and
   reliable instrument, The questionnaire provides data on outcomes of
   great concern to patients, including pain, function, and satisfaction,
   Use of the questionnaire with traditional measures of outcome
   (complications, findings of physical examination, and radiographic
   findings) and in conjunction with a health-status instrument provides a
   comprehensive system for the assessment of the results of total hip
   arthroplasty.}},

   artificial blood substitute, perfluorochemical emulsion Fluosol-43.
   After normothermic global ischemia of fifteen minutes, postischemic
   reperfusion of sixty-five minutes was carried out. Methylprednisolone
   sodium succinate (MPSS) was administered either prior to global ischemia
   or during postischemic reperfusion. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP),
   creatine phosphate (CrP), inorganic phosphate (Pi), pH, left ventricular
   systolic developed pressure (LV DevP) and coronary flow were
   continuously measured. Thirty-six hearts were divided into three
   experimental groups consisting of 12 hearts each; CONT consisted of
   controls, Pre-MPSS perfusion with MPSS-containing solution (10(-4)M)
   from forty-five minutes prior to global ischemia, and Post-MPSS with the
   same MPSS solution immediately after postischemic reperfusion. Pre-MPSS
   showed a significant inhibition of the increase in Pi and of the
   decrease in ATP and pH during global ischemia, in comparison with the
   other groups, and a suppression of the overshoot of CrP observed
   immediately after postischemic reperfusion. LV DevP of Pre-MPSS showed a
   marked improvement during the postischemic reperfusion as compared with
   CONT. In Post-MPSS, Pi was significantly increased and ATP decreased
   during the postischemic reperfusion as compared with the other two
   groups. There were no differences in coronary flow during postischemic
   reperfusion among the three groups. In conclusion MPSS has a beneficial
   effect on metabolism and contractility of the stunned myocardium when it
   is administered prior to ischemia.}},

   Methods-Four thousand blood cultures were monitored and the information
   relating to the positive cultures was noted and analysed.
   Results-Four hundred and seventy seven blood cultures were detected as
   positive, 81\% (387/477) of which were detected within 48 hours. The
   most pathogenic organisms were detected in the shortest period, less
   pathogenic later and those generally regarded as contaminants last.
   Clinically important isolates were also detected earlier. Many positive
   blood cultures were detected in only one bottle of the set, even those
   regarded as clinically important.
   Conclusions-The management of continuously monitoring blood culture

Abstract = {{The calcine leaching circuit at the Pasminco Metals -EZ plant has
   recently been extensively upgraded, with the pachuca leaching and iron
   purification stages being replaced. The modernised leaching circuit is a
   conventional counter-current plant, composed of two low-acid calcine
   leaching stages, (neutral leach and weak-acid leach), an iron
   precipitation stage (jarosite precipitation) and three high-acid
   leaching stages (preneutralisation, hot-acid leach and strong-acid
   leach).
   Integration of the new leaching circuit and closure of the old pachuca
   leaching section commenced in March 1990. On completion in September
   1991, the leaching capacity increased to produce 220 000 t zinc per
   annum.
   The thickening and filtration sections, in the high-acid leaching stages
   of the modernised leach circuit, did not perform satisfactorily from the
   outset, because of the presence of very fine particulate material
   containing high concentrations of silica. The silica-bearing particles
   formed a recirculating load within the high-acid leaching stages,
   increasing the silica content of thickener feeds. The resultant low
   density thickener underflows, containing less than 200 g solids/l,
   increased recycle flows through the plant and severely limited the
   capacity of the filters used for filtering the secondary leach residue
   from the high-acid leaching stages. Zinc production was only maintained
   by reducing the lead and silica content of zinc concentrates and
   utilising all available filter capacity for secondary leach residue.
   Silica in the preneutralisation stage liquors is partially precipitated
   in the jarosite stage. The residual silica in the jarosite precipitation
   stage liquors was found to be a significant contributor to the
   particulate silica in the high-acid leaching stages. Various options
   were explored to increase silica precipitation in the jarosite
   precipitation stage, with the addition of a coagulant to this stage
   being the most cost effective.
   Thickeners previously full of low-density pulps are now devoid of pulp,
   with underflows containing up to 400 g solids/l. The secondary leach
   residue filters now have surplus capacity, and the lead content of the
   residue has increased from 26 to 36\%. The restriction on lead and
   silica in zinc concentrates has been removed.}},

Abstract = {{Bupropion (BUP) may be less likely than other antidepressants to cause
   switches into mania and rapid cycling, suggesting utility in bipolar
   disorder. The combination of BW with the mood-stabilizing
   anticonvulsants carbamazepine (CBZ) or valproate (VPA) is a strategy
   that might further lessen the risk of mania. CBZ induces, and to a
   lesser extent WA inhibits the hepatic metabolism of various medications,
   but their effects on BUP have not been previously studied. Inpatients
   with mood disorders had pharmacokinetic profiles of BUP and metabolites
   assessed after single, oral, 150-mg doses of BUP while receiving placebo
   (N = 17) or during chronic blind CBZ (N = 12) or VPA (N = 5)
   monotherapy. CBZ but not VPA therapy decreased BUP peak concentrations
   (C-max) by 87\% (p < 0.0001) and 24-h area under the curve (AUG) by 90\%
   (p < 0.0001), threohydrobupropion C-max by 81\% (p < 0.0009) and AUC by
   86\% (p < 0.002), and erythropydrobupropion C-max by 86\% (p < 0.05) and
   AUC by 96\% (p < 0.05). CBZ increased hydroxybupropion (H-BUP) C-max by
   71\% (p < 0.007) and AUC by 50\% (p < 0.05). VPA increased H-BW C-max by
   56\% (p < 0.09) and H-BUP AUC by 94\% (p < 0.02). Thus, CBZ markedly
   decreased BUP and increased H-BUP concentrations, whereas VPA did not
   affect BUP but increased H-BUP concentrations. Further studies are
   required to determine how these differential effects of CBZ and VPA on
   BUP pharmacokinetics influence the tolerability and efficacy of
   combination therapies with these agents.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis is made of a global distribution of clouds and the main
   processes of cloud formation in Earth climatic system. Mesostructure and

   clouds in numerical models are discussed. Mesoscale cloud models with
   explicit microphysics and results of simulations for various cloud types
   are described with an example of a series of 2DT and 3DT models,
   developed at Central Aerological Observatory (CAO). The models are
   peculiar to the explicit description of the microphysical processes in
   clouds, based on the kinetic equations for droplet and crystal size
   distribution functions with division of droplet and crystal size spectra
   into 30 bins from 1 mu m to 3.5 mm and with detailed account for CCN and
   ice nuclei activation, condensation/deposition and coalescence/accretion
   growth. These equations are being solved along with supersaturation
   equation. This allows to make detailed calculations of the optical and
   radiative characteristics of clouds: scattering and absorption
   coefficients, single-scattering albedo, fluxes, albedo. Development of
   various cloud types (Sc in ABL, frontal stratiform, convective and Ci,
   orographic) and their interaction with longwave and solar radiation are
   reviewed on the basis of mesoscale modelling and some observational
   data. The results of such calculations can serve as a basis for a
   detailed parameterization of clouds and radiation in the GCM's.
   Recommendations for the GCM's and for the construction of a global

Abstract = {{The phosphodiesterase inhibitor oxpentifylline (OXP) has a number of
   potentially important immunomodulatory actions which include a selective
   inhibition of the Th1 subset of CD4(+) cells in vitro and inhibition of
   tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA transcription. In vivo, it has a
   dramatic protective effect against experimental allergic
   encephalomyelitis. In this animal model, tissue injury is associated
   with both a Th1 response and with TNF-alpha production, either of which
   could be targets for the protective action of OXP. In an attempt to
   clarify the relative importance of the Th cell subsets and TNF-alpha in
   pathogenesis, we investigated the effect of OXP on a Th2 model of T
   cell-dependent disease, mercuric chloride (HgCl2)-induced autoimmunity
   in the Brown Norway rat. The effects of OXP on the Th1:Th2 response,
   TNF-alpha mRNA transcription in spleen and ankle joints, and on the
   incidence and severity of arthritis and cecal vasculitis have been
   examined and the effects in vivo have been compared with those of a
   soluble TNF receptor-IgG1 fusion protein (sTNFR) that neutralizes rat
   TNF-alpha. In two separate experiments, OXP significantly enhanced
   unstimulated levels of splenic interleukin-4 (IL-4) mRNA (median 62\%,
   of an artificial IL-4 mRNA construct, vs. 36.5\% in controls) and in one
   experiment, exaggerated the total IgE response to HgCl2. OXP inhibited
   HgCl2-induced TNF-alpha mRNA transcription in spleen and ankle joints.
   In three separate experiments, OXP had a significant protective effect
   against arthritis, with the mean incidence reduced from 100\% to 30\%
   and mean peak score reduced from 7.2 to 2.59 (experiments 1 and 2). The
   protection against arthritis was indistinguishable from that produced by
   sTNFR. There was no such protection against cecal vasculitis with either
   OXP or sTNFR. These results demonstrate that OXP induces a shift towards
   a Th2 response, inhibits TNF-alpha mRNA transcription locally in joint
   and systemically in spleen, and has a protective effect against
   arthritis similar to that produced by sTNFR in the HgCl2-treated BN rat.
   We conclude that TNF-alpha is a critical cytokine in the pathogenesis of
   arthritis but not cecal vasculitis in this model, and that inhibition of
   TNF-alpha transcription is the most important mode of action of OXP in
   this situation. OXP may be a potential therapeutic agent in the
   treatment of other arthritides, such as human rheumatoid arthritis, in
   which TNF-alpha has been implicated in pathogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Using a multi-locus minisatellite Per-6 DNA probe, we performed DNA
   fingerprint analysis. Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells were treated with
   six model chemicals: N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitomycin C,
   methyl methanesulfonate, furylfuramide, 2-acetylamino-fluorene, and
   cyclophosphamide, with or without S9 mix. 771 hypoxanthine
   phosphoribosyltransferase deficient clones (749 from mutagen-treated
   cells and 22 from untreated cells) and 90 unselected clones from
   untreated cells were isolated and analyzed. The spontaneous mutation
   frequency at CHL cell minisatellite loci was 0.31-0.63\%. All the
   chemicals increased mutation frequencies. Almost all mutations localized
   to the three specific minisatellite loci corresponding to 4.2, 3.8, and
   2.4 kb bands, suggesting that these regions are more unstable and
   susceptible to mutation. DNA fingerprint analysis is a promising
   technique for detecting mutations at neutral DNA regions, especially
   recombinational mutations, and may be useful for surveying genetic
   instability related to heritable defects or aging.}},

Abstract = {{We postulate that another serious nuclear power reactor accident
   anywhere will have a disastrous impact on the future of nuclear power
   everywhere, irrespective of the reactor type involved. The intention of
   this paper is to give an objective estimate of the industry average
   probability of such an accident within the next few years, as a function
   of past commercial nuclear power plant operational experience, and as a
   function of past operational and probabilistic safety assessment
   experiences, and to compare the results. `Objective probability' is
   taken to mean involving a minimum number of statistical assumptions and
   `industry average' the pooling of data from all currently operating
   plants (all of them being based on `active' safety technology). Further,
   the impact of including industry average probabilistic safety assessment
   experience in the estimation gives an indication on the appropriate way
   of using this method. We conclude that probabilistic safety assessment
   is highly qualified as art internal tool to identify and evaluate
   possible areas for further improvements in safety and/or operating
   performance. Using its results primarily as compact single-number
   arguments to convince the public on the high safety status of the
   nuclear power industry is, however, nothing but a waste of time and
   money. Since nuclear power produces not one drop of acid rain and not
   one waft of carbon dioxide, the development of reactors with
   fundamentally different safety characteristics that do not longer need
   probabilistic justification ('passive safety') is a task of crucial
   importance in order to secure clean, large-scale generation of
   electricity in the future.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is about the role of technology in the transformation of
   space, and the ways in which these changes are represented. These
   processes are explored principally through critical analysis of the work
   df Harvey and Lefebvre; more specifically, I contrast the place of
   technology as expressed through their varied emphases on the
   annihilation of space, and the production of space. The dramatic
   restructuring of space and time in recent decades, associated with new
   high-speed geographies of production, exchange, and consumption, has
   been theorized against the backdrop of a `shrinking world'. The popular
   conception of the world shrinking to a global village is generally seen
   as the product of technological advances in telecommunications,
   transportation, and `information'. For Harvey, these innovations are
   seen as the means through which capital has freed itself from spatial
   constraints. By placing the `collapse of space' jargon alongside Marx's
   phrase, the annihilation of space by time, these spatial metaphors serve
   Harvey as shorthand for the complexities of time-space compression; the
   shrinking world is seen as a midpoint between a regime of accumulation
   and a mode of representation. I argue that, although these metaphors
   help to theorize the relativity of space-as the global impinges on the
   local-they only do so by obfuscating the relative space of everyday
   life, and the increasingly technical means through which it is produced.
   Through an interpretation of Lefebvre's discussion of technology in The
   Production of Space, I suggest how the role of technology in the
   transformation of space is not limited to those globalizing processes
   through which the world has been made increasingly interconnected in
   space and time. So too, technology has been critical to the domination
   of conceived space over lived space as social relations are spatialized
   at the scale of experience. As a foundation for these arguments, the
   social relations of technology and technological change are theorized
   through the incorporation of ideas from the social studies of science
   and technology and from critical human geography.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of the
   sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the transition from compensated
   pressure-overload hypertrophy (increased left ventricular {[}LV] mass,
   normal LV function, and no pulmonary congestion) to congestive heart
   failure (increased LV mass, depressed LV function, and pulmonary
   congestion). To address this issue, the descending thoracic aorta was
   banded for 4 and 8 weeks in adult guinea pigs, and the changes in
   isovolumic LV mechanics, SR Ca2+ transport, and SR protein levels were
   determined and compared with age-matched sham-operated control animals.
   A subgroup of the 8-week banded animals manifested the congestive heart
   failure phenotype with diminished developed LV pressure normalized by LV
   mass, reduced rates of LV pressure development and relaxation, and
   markedly increased lung weight-to-body weight ratios. The cardiac
   mechanical and morphometric changes were associated with depressed
   protein levels of the SR Ca2+-ATPase (85\% of the control) and
   phospholamban (65\% of the control) assessed by quantitative
   immunoblotting. Resultant rates of SR Ca2+ uptake (V-max) and the
   affinity of SR Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+ (EC(50)) were significantly
   depressed {[}32 +/- 6 nmol Ca2+. min(-1). mg(-1) and 0.59 +/- 0.12 (mu
   mol/L)/L, respectively] compared with the 8-week sham-operated control
   animals {[}40 +/- 1 nmol Ca2+. min(-1). mg(-1) and 0.40 +/- 0.05 (mu
   mol/L)/L, respectively]. We conclude that this model of pressure
   overload-induced cardiac failure is associated with (1) diminished LV
   force development, rates of pressure development, and decay; (2)
   depressed protein expression of the Ca2+-cycling, proteins SR
   Ca2+-ATPase and phospholamban; and (3) decreased V-max and affinity of
   the SR Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+. These findings implicate these Ca2+-cycling
   proteins in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure.}},

Abstract = {{Various Ni2+-substituted tetrasilicic micas having high contents of
   Ni2+, such as KNiMgLi(Si4O10)F-2, KNi2Li (Si4O10)F-2 and
   KNi2.5(Si4O10)F-2, were synthesized at ca. 900 degrees C through
   solid-state reaction techniques. Lattice constants a, b, c decreased
   with increasing Ni2+-substitutions, reflecting the decrease in the ionic
   radius of Ni2+ against Mg2+. UV-visible spectra of Ni2+-micas were very
   similar to those of {[}Ni(H2O)(6)](2+). This can be explained in terms
   of the nephelauxetic series F- < H2O < O-a (apical oxygen) as well as
   the spectrochemical series F- < H2O < O-a. IR spectra showed that the
   tetrahedral distortion changes with increasing Ni2+-substitutions, i.e.,
   the interatomic distance of Si-O-a lengthens while that of Si-O-b(basal
   oxygen) shortens. Ni2+-micas exhibited paramagnetism when the Ni2+
   content was smaller than 2.0 mol in octahedral sites, however,
   antiferromagnetism seemed to appear at larger substitutions of 2.5 mol
   Ni2+ per formula unit.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter the trade-off between threshold voltage (V-th) and the
   minimum gate length (L(min)) is discussed for optimizing the performance
   of buried channel PMOS transistors for low voltage/low power high-speed
   digital CMOS circuits. In a low supply voltage CMOS technology it is
   desirable to scale V-th and L(min) for improved circuit performance.
   However, these two parameters cannot be scaled independently due to the
   channel punch-through effect. Statistical process/device modeling, split
   lot experiments, circuit simulations, and measurements are performed to
   optimize the PMOS transistor current drive and CMOS circuit speed. We
   show that trading PMOS transistor V-th for a smaller L(min) results in
   faster circuits for low supply voltage (3.3 to 1.8 V) n(+)-polysilicon
   gate CMOS technology, Circuit simulation and measurements are performed
   in this study. Approximate empirical expressions are given for the
   optimum buried channel PMOS transistor V-th for minimizing CMOS circuit
   speed for cases involving: (1) constant capacitive load and (2) load
   capacitance proportional to MOS gate capacitance, The results of the
   numerical exercise are applied to the centering of device parameters of
   a 0.5 mu m 3.3 V CMOS technology that (a) matches the speed of our 0.5
   mu m 5 V CMOS technology, and (b) achieves good performance down to 1.8
   V power supply {[}1]. For this process the optimum PMOS transistor V-th
   (absolute value) is approximately 0.85-0.90 V.}},

Abstract = {{The nasal cavities were examined in 56 cases of sudden infant death
   syndrome (SIDS) and 26 control cases and the following criteria were
   compared: inflammatory infiltration of the nasal mucosa (SIDS 59\% -
   controls 65\%; P = 0.577), diapedesis of inflammatory cells (SIDS 38\% -
   controls 42\%; P = 0.678), epithelial desquamation (SIDS 62\% - controls
   85\%; P = 0.043); hyperemia (SIDS 66\% - controls 65\%; P = 0.951) and
   hypersecretion of the seromucous glands (SIDS 55\% - controls 69\%; P =
   0.233). Only epithelial desquamation was found significantly more often
   in the controls than in SIDS cases, but these alterations are unspecific
   and are influenced by the postmortem interval. The intensity of rhinitis
   was not different between the SIDS and control groups. The frequency of
   rhinitis is therefore not specific for the sudden infant death syndrome,
   and seems to be merely a result of the high incidence of upper
   respiratory tract infections in this age group. We speculate, however,
   that infections of the nose in conjunction with other factors, such as
   prone position, covering of the head, hyperthermia, parental smoking and
   immaturity of the central nervous system, could play a role in the

Title = {{GLYCINE AND GABA INFLUENCE BINAURAL PROCESSING IN THE INFERIOR
   COLLICULUS OF THE MOUSTACHE BAT}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1701-1713}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. The mammalian inferior colliculus contains large populations of
   binaural cells that are excited by stimulation of the contralateral ear
   and are inhibited by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear, and are called
   excitatory/inhibitory (EI) cells. Neurons with EI properties are
   initially created in the lateral superior olive (LSO), which, in turn,
   sends strong bilateral projections to the inferior colliculus. The
   questions that we address in this report are 1) whether the inhibition
   evoked by stimulation of the ipsilateral ear occurs at the inferior
   colliculus or whether it occurs in a lower nucleus, presumably the LSO;
   and 2) if the ipsilaterally evoked inhibition occurs at the inferior
   colliculus, is the inhibition a consequence of glycinergic innervation
   or is it a consequence of GABAergic innervation. To study these
   questions, we recorded from 61 EI neurons in the inferior colliculus of
   the mustache bat before and during the iontophoretic application of the
   glycine receptor antagonist, strychnine. We also tested the effects of
   the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptor antagonist,
   bicuculline, on 38 of the 61 neurons that were tested with strychnine.
   The main finding is that glycinergic or GABAergic inhibition, or both,
   contribute to the ipsilaterally evoked inhibition in similar to 50\% of
   the EI neurons in the inferior colliculus.
   2. Strychnine and bicuculline had different effects on the magnitude of
   the spike counts evoked by stimulation of the contralateral (excitatory)
   ear. On average, strychnine caused the maximum spike count evoked by
   contralateral stimulation to increase by only 23\%. The relatively small
   effects of strychnine on response magnitude are in marked contrast to
   the effects of bicuculline, which usually caused much larger increases
   in spike counts. For example, although strychnine caused spike counts to
   more than double in similar to 25\% of the collicular neurons,
   bicuculline caused a doubling of the spike count in similar to 60\% of
   the cells.
   3. The inhibitory influences of ipsilateral stimulation were evaluated
   by driving the neurons with a fixed intensity at the contralateral ear
   and then documenting the reductions in spike counts due to the
   presentation of progressively higher intensities at the ipsilateral ear.
   In 64\% of the neurons sampled, blocking glycinergic inhibition with
   strychnine had little or no effect on the ipsilaterally evoked
   inhibition. These cells remained as strongly inhibited during the
   application of strychnine as they did before its application. In
   addition, the ipsilateral intensity that produced complete or nearly
   complete spike suppression in the predrug condition was also unchanged
   by strychnine.
   4. In 36\% of the neurons, strychnine markedly reduced the degree of
   ipsilaterally evoked spike suppression. In five of these neurons, there
   was a complete elimination of the ipsilateral inhibition: these neurons
   were transformed from strongly inhibited EI neurons into monaural
   neurons.
   5. The influence of both strychnine and bicuculline was tested
   sequentially in 38 neurons. In about one-half of these cells, (53\%,
   20/38) the ipsilaterally evoked inhibition was unaffected by either
   drug. In 10 other units (26\%), both drugs substantially reduced or
   eliminated the ipsilaterally evoked inhibition. In most of these cells,
   both bicuculline and strychnine reduced the ipsilaterally evoked
   inhibition to a similar degree. In the remaining eight cells studied
   with both drugs (21\%), the ipsilaterally evoked inhibition was reduced
   or eliminated by one of the drugs, but not by both.
   6. These results show that both glycinergic and GABAergic projections
   influence the ipsilaterally evoked inhibition in about one-half of the
   EI neurons in the inferior colliculus. The glycinergic inhibition
   elicited by ipsilateral stimulation is most likely due to projections
   from the ipsilateral lateral superior olive, whereas the GABAergic
   inhibition evoked by ipsilateral stimulation is most likely caused by
   the projections from the contralateral dorsal nucleus of the lateral
   lemniscus.}},

   Marginal sites for these species (with species present in one of three
   years) were intermediate between unoccupied (never present) and occupied
   sites along environmental gradients characterized by increasing size of
   shrub habitat patches and total shrub cover and by decreasing
   disturbance. Horned Larks and Western Meadowlarks, typical grassland
   species, were not sensitive to landscape features, and their occupancy
   depended on the amount of grassland or shrub cozier. In contrast to
   shrubsteppe species, sites that varied by occupancy rates of Western
   Meadowlarks did not significantly differ in vegetation or landscape
   components. Our results demonstrate that fragmentation of shrubsteppe
   significantly influenced the presence of shrub-obligate species. Because
   of restoration difficulties, the disturbance of semiarid shrubsteppe may
   cause irreversible loss of habitat and significant long-term
   consequences for the conservation of shrub-obligate birds.}},

Abstract = {{The intelligence quotient (IQ) of 60 patients with homozygous sickle
   cell (SS) disease and 60 age and sex matched controls with a normal
   haemoglobin (AA) genotype aged 15-18 years, followed up in a cohort
   study fi om birth, was assessed by the Wechsler intelligence scales for
   children or for adults. IQ appeared to be normally distributed in both
   genotypes but mean values in SS disease were 5.6 points (95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 1.0 to 10.2) lower than in AA controls (p=0.016). The
   difference occurred in both verbal (5.5 points, p=0.017) and performance
   (5.0 points, p=0.044) subscales of the IQ score and the IQ defect in SS
   disease was associated with a significantly lower attention factor score
   (p=0.005) but not with other factor scores. The genotype difference in
   IQ was not accounted for by differences in parental occupational revel,
   school absenteeism, or school drop out, or reported activity level. In
   SS disease, IQ was not related to mean steady state haemoglobin, fetal
   haemoglobin, or mean cell haemoglobin concentration, or clinical
   severity as judged by the frequency of painful crises, hospital
   admission, or sick visits. IQ, at age 15-18 years, correlated with the
   patients' height at all ages from 1 to 10 years (partial correlations
   increasing from 0.14 (p=0.15) at age 1 to 0.27 (p=0.004) at age 10).
   Adjusting for height reduced the mean genotype difference in IQ to 5.5
   (95\% CI 0.6 to 10.3) points at age 1 and to 2.6 points (95\% CI to
   -2.3, 7.5) at age 10. Prepubertal height therefore accounted for much of
   the genotype difference in IQ. It is speculated that early factors,
   possibly nutritional, contribute to both impaired growth and mental
   development in sickle cell disease.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier studies have suggested that catalase activity (CA) may represent
   a biological marker of alcohol intake in animals and in humans. An
   initial study was designed to rule out the possibility that CA is
   induced as a function of acute alcohol intake. Subjects (n = 80) were
   presented with either an alcohol (0.5 g/kg of body weight) or control
   solution, and asked to provide four 100-mu l blood samples at 0.0, 0.5,
   2.0, and 24.0 hr. Results showed no differences in CA between
   individuals who had received alcohol, and controls, even when the
   effects of previous drinking history were covaried out. This lack of
   effect of acute alcohol intake on the possible induction of CA further
   supported the notion that CA may be a viable marker of alcohol intake,
   rather than the converse. In the second study, the relation between CA
   and alcohol intake was investigated in individuals with a family history
   (FH) of alcoholism (FH+), and in those without a family history of
   alcoholism (FH-). Subjects (n = 607) completed the Michigan Alcoholism
   Screening Questionnaire, the MacAndrew Scale, and the Concordia
   University Alcohol Screening Questionnaire; answered questions
   concerning their FH for alcoholism; and provided a 100-mu l blood
   sample. Results showed that FH+ individuals had higher mean CA compared
   with FH- individuals. When individuals with FH+ were compared with those
   with FH-, differences in the pattern of relation between CA and alcohol
   intake were observed. Although a significant relation between CA and
   alcohol intake was obtained for both FH- and FH+ individuals, this
   relation was significantly higher (p < 0.001) for individuals with FH+.
   Results from a multiple regression analyses suggested that CA in FH+
   individuals made the highest single contribution to the variance, even
   after accounting for several additional variables. These results support
   the contention that CA may be a biological marker of the propensity of
   FH+ individuals to consume alcohol.}},

   meta-analysis was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this new form
   of treatment and to develop a rational approach to the management of
   liver hydatosis by ultrasound guided PD.
   Method Relevant articles published in English, French and German from
   1983 to 1993 were identified through a computer search of data on the
   clinical manifestations, complications, anthelmintic treatment in
   combination with PD and on recurrence rate.
   Results 104 hydatid cysts treated by US-guided PD were published in
   literature. In 25 \% of the cases diagnosis was unsuspected prior to PD.
   None of these patients developed serious complications. All symptomatic
   patients were relieved of symptoms. None of the patients needed surgery
   The complication rate was 14.4 \% and mortality was zero. Anthelmintic
   drug treatment in combination with PD showed no reduction of side
   effects. No recurrences were reported during follow-up (3-31 month).
   Conclusion With proper patient monitoring US-guided PD can be
   recommended as a routine diagnostic and therapeutic tool in liver
   hydatosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Renin is classically secreted from juxtaglomerular cells of
   the kidney by endocrine or paracrine mechanisms. In a previous report,
   intense renin immunoreactivity was observed in the coagulating gland
   (CG), a new source for renin in mice. In the present study,
   immunoelectron microscopical analysis for renin was carried out to
   clarify the secretory site of CGs,
   Methods: Five adult male C57BL/6 mice were used in this study, The CGs
   were fixed with an ice-cold 2\% glutaraldehyde and 2\% paraformaldehyde
   mixture and embedded in Lowicryl K4M. Ultrathin sections were treated
   with antimouse renin antiserum and colloidal gold (15 nm)-labeled
   protein A complex.
   Results: In immunoelectron microscopical observation, renin was first
   detected at the Golgi vacuoles just budding from the lamellae, although
   it was not demonstrated in all Golgi vacuoles. In the production series
   of exocrine granules, renin immunoreactivity was observed in some
   granules that were distributed in the supranuclear region. Both
   renin-positive and -negative exocrine granules were secreted from the
   apical cell membrane by exocytosis. The lysosomal granules also showed
   stronger renin immunoreactivity and contained homogeneous or
   heterogeneous materials. In the supranuclear region, it was observed
   that exocrine granules were fused with irregular lysosomal granules. At
   the apical region, such lysosomal granules were closely associated with
   cell membrane. At the basolateral region, immunoreactivity for renin was
   localized in electron dense granules.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that part of the renin in the CGs is
   released by exocrine secretion into the genital tract. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Rana temporaria sartorius muscle fibres were exposed to varied sequences
   of solution and temperature changes that have been employed hitherto in
   procedures that sought to decouple the transverse tubules from the
   surface membrane. The incidence of such detubulation was assessed in
   large numbers of fibres through demonstrating a loss or otherwise of the
   after-depolarization that normally reflects successful tubular
   propagation of the surface action potential. This criterion yielded
   assessments of the existing detubulation techniques in agreement with
   earlier results. The experiments then developed an improved detubulation
   procedure that required only brief (15 min) exposures to glycerol, its
   replacement in a single step by a Ca2+/Mg2+-Ringer solution for 30 min,
   and rapid cooling from room temperature (19-21 degrees C) to 6-10
   degrees C prior to final restoration of the normal Ringer solution. This
   sequence of steps yielded an optimal incidence (98\%) of detubulation in
   viable surface fibres that were amenable to electrophysiological
   studies. Studies that systematically modified the detubulation procedure
   demonstrated that the omission of any one step in the protocol
   significantly reduced the incidence of detubulation with or without
   accompanying deteriorations in fibre resting potentials. Successful
   detubulation accordingly required an initial exposure to an optimal
   glycerol concentration that lasted for a minimal duration and for its
   abrupt withdrawal. Inclusion of a cooling step within 30 min after
   glycerol withdrawal was coincident with, and critical to, optimal
   tubular isolation. Thus, cooling steps that either preceded, or that
   followed the glycerol withdrawal step by more than 60 min, resulted in a
   sharp reduction in the incidence of detubulation. Similarly, a critical
   period of exposure to Ca2+/Mg2+ Ringer solution also promoted
   detubulation without compromising the recovery of stable and
   satisfactory resting potentials. The findings reported here remain
   consistent with a primarily osmotic mechanism for detubulation. However,
   they demonstrated additional and important influences of temperature and
   of divalent cation concentration on the extent of tubular detachment
   when such factors were modified during the time course of the expected
   volume changes that followed each adjustment in osmotic condition.}},

Abstract = {{The radiolytic reduction of colorless tetrazolium salts in aqueous
   solution to the highly colored formazan dye is a well-known acid-forming
   radiation chemical reaction. Radiochromic thin films and
   three-dimensional hydrocolloid gels have been used for imaging and
   mapping absorbed dose distributions. The high solubility of
   2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in alcohols provides a useful
   liquid dosimeter (45 mM TTC in aerated ethanol) and shows a linear
   response of absorbance increase (lambda(max) = 480 nm) with dose over
   the range 1-16 kGy. The linear molar absorption coefficient (epsilon(m))
   for the formazan at the absorption peak is 1.5 x 10(3) m(2) mol(-1), and
   the radiation chemical yield for the above solution is G (formazan) =
   0.014 mu mol J(-1) The irradiation temperature coefficient is about 0.8
   percent per degree Celsius rise in temperature over the temperature
   range 0-30 degrees C but is much larger between 30 degrees and 60
   degrees C. The unirradiated and irradiated solutions are stable over at
   least five days storage at normal laboratory temperature in the dark,
   but when stored in daylight at elevated temperature, the unirradiated
   solution in sealed amber glass ampoules undergoes slow photolytic dye
   formation, and the irradiated solution experiences initial fading and
   subsequent reversal (photochromism) when exposed to direct sunlight.}},

   days on 0.6 X 10(-4) m(3) MS (Murashige and Skoog, 1962, Physiol.
   Plant., 15: 473-497) agar (8 kg m(-3)) medium with no added sugar in 3.7
   X 10(-3) m(3) polycarbonate boxes. Each box had two 10 mm holes covered
   with microporous filter to facilitate air exchange (3.6 air exchanges
   per hour). The average daily temperature in the culture room was set the
   same at 23 degrees C for all treatments, and CO2 concentration and
   relative humidity were maintained at 400-500 mu mol mol(-1) and 50-70\%,
   respectively. Stem length was significantly suppressed under 0 or -9
   DIF, high PPF and long photoperiod. Stem diameter, leaf area and number
   of leaves were significantly enhanced by long photoperiod and high PPF,
   but affected little by DIF level. Specific leaf area was little affected
   by photoperiod, but decreased under high PPF and under low DIF. Long
   photoperiod and high PPF led to an increase in the fresh and dry weights
   maintaining similar percentage dry matter and to enhanced root growth.
   Under the same amount of integrated PPF, fresh and dry weights of leaf,
   stem, root and whole plantlet were significantly higher under the long
   photoperiod and low PPF conditions than under the short photoperiod and
   high PPF conditions. Because of suppressed root growth under short
   photoperiod, shoot to root dry weight ratio increased under short
   photoperiod, but was not affected by DIF. It is suggested that under
   photoautotrophic conditions a combination of high PPF level, long
   photoperiod, and zero or negative DIF produces potato plantlets in vitro
   of short and thick stem with similar number and increased area of
   leaves, which are desirable for transfer to ex vitro conditions.}},

   Information technology provides exciting possibilities for bringing

   describe the use of annotated still-image case studies in a senior
   undergraduate project-management class. A project manager, at a
   nine-story building site, discussed project-management problems with the
   students. Using a picturephone, the manager showed still images of the
   problem and talked to the students about the problem. The students were
   able to question him using another picturephone in the classroom. The
   effectiveness of this technology was determined using the four measures
   of `'clear,'' `'useful,'' `'attractive,'' and `'challenging.'' A
   questionnaire survey of the students showed that they found the case
   studies effective and preferred the ones delivered by the actual project
   manager. The students listed major benefits of the use of these case
   studies to be identifying project-management problems, reinforcing
   writing skills, and learning the need to communicate effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmids containing cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) DNA can
   induce papillomas in vivo, but efficiency has been low. The aim of the
   present investigation was to explore some of the technical variables
   involved in inoculation of rabbits with recombinant CRPV DNA in attempts
   to improve both yield and consistency of papilloma induction. It was
   found that induction of epidermal hyperplasia, with either a mixture of
   turpentine and acetone or phorbol esters, produced a marked increase in
   papilloma yield. An additional powerful factor was the use of very
   vigorous, cutaneous scarification, sufficient to penetrate the papillary
   dermis and produce bleeding. When used in combination, papilloma yields
   were consistent and often reached 90-100\% of inoculated sites. A number
   of other variables which did not consistently affect papilloma yield
   were tested. These included bleb and puncture injections, plasmid dose,
   vector type, occlusive dressings, lipofection reagent, carrier DNA, and
   different methods for plasmid DNA extraction and purification. It is
   concluded that the most important variables in improving papilloma
   yields were prior induction of epidermal hyperplasia and vigorous
   cutaneous scarification.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the quality of life in octogenarians after open
   heart surgery.
   Background: Despite an increasing number of cardiac operations on
   octogenarians, the outcome as measured by functional status,
   independence of living, and psychological parameters of quality of life
   remain unproved.
   Methods: Two groups of octogenarians (group 1, undergoing operation in
   1986; group 2 in 1991) were reviewed retrospectively to determine
   operative mortality and functional results.
   Results: Group 1 (n=15, mean age of 83.2 years) and group 2 (n=53, mean
   age 83.0 years) were studied. Operations included isolated coronary
   artery bypass grafting (group 1, 10; group 2, 29) and valve replacements
   +/- coronary artery bypass grafting +/- other procedures (group 1: 5;
   group 2, 24). Group 1 had 9\% hospital mortality and 53\% actuarial
   survival after a mean follow-up of 6.3 years, Group 2 had 17\% hospital
   mortality and 72\% actuarial survival after a mean follow-up of 1.5
   years. At follow-up, significant improvements were observed in New York
   Heart Association (NYHA) angina class, congestive cardiac failure class,
   number of cardiovascular symptoms, and indices for satisfaction with
   overall life and general affect in both groups. Further, group 2 also
   showed significant improvements in independence of living, ease of life,
   and Karnofsky dependency category, but these improvements were less
   evident in group 1 after a longer period of follow-up. At follow-up,
   75\% of group I and 84\% of group 2 octogenarians would definitely have
   made the same decision to undergo open heart surgery in retrospect.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates improved quality of life after open
   heart surgery in octogenarians.}},

   insulation of the round window with clay was performed, Umbo
   displacement was also measured before tympanic membrane removal to
   assess baseline tympanic membrane function, The middle ear has its major
   gain in the lower frequencies, with a peak near 0.9 kHz. The mean gain
   was 23.0 dB below 1.0 kHz, the resonant frequency of the middle ear; the
   mean peak gain was 26.6 dB, Above 1.0 kHz, the sound pressure gain
   decreased at a rate of -8.6 dB/octave, with a mean gain of 6.5 dB at 4.0
   kHz. Only a small amount of gain was present above 7.0 kHz. Significant

Abstract = {{Acid/base properties and phenylphosphonic acid (H(2)L) complexation at
   the water-suspended-and-aged gamma-Al2O3/water interface have been
   studied in 0.1 M Na(CI) medium at 25.0 degrees C in the range 5.0 <
   -log{[}H+] < 9.5. Equilibrium measurements were performed as a series of
   potentiometric titrations supplemented with spectrophotometric
   phosphorous analyses, In the evaluation of the experimental data, the
   contribution from electrostatic forces was accounted for by using the
   constant-capacitance model. The adsorption of phenylphosphonic acid onto
   the studied phase was found to be strong at -log{[}H+] < 7. Desorption
   was observed when -log{[}H+] was increased toward 9.5. The specific
   capacitance was evaluated from data collected in the absence of
   phenylphosphonic acid. The model describing the acid/base reactions and
   phenylphosphonic acid binding onto the studied alumina surface, (=
   AlOH), is given by the following equilibria, intrinsic constants,
   specific capacitance, and site density:
   = AlOH + H+ = = AlOH log beta(110(int)) = 7.51 +/- 0.09

Abstract = {{The establishment of pionner plants is studied along a river gravel bar
   recently emerged An upstream-downstream gradient of species richness is
   correlated to a gradient of granulometric characteristics contrasting
   upstream coarse substrata to downstream fine substrata. At a any point
   of this gradient the plant species richness was enhanced in sires
   sheltered from the current such as downstream to woody debris or
   perennial plants, and where silt might accumulate. Rates of germination
   and of mortality of pioneer species varied as silt accumulated From 250
   g/m(2), an increase in the rate of germination and a decrease in the
   rate of mortality were observed. Above 750-1,000 g/m(2) the rate of
   germination decreased Silt accumulations of 500 g/m(2) corresponded to a
   maximum density and species richness. It is suggested that at this rate
   of silt accumulation, conditions of humidity, temperature and light
   penetration may be optimum for the establishment of pioneer plant
   assemblages on the studied gravel bar.}},

Abstract = {{Granuloma formation in murine schistosomiasis is dependent on CD4(+) Th
   lymphocytes and requires recruitment and accumulation of inflammatory
   cells at the site of egg deposition. The present study examined the role
   of three adhesion molecules, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1),
   lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), and very late
   antigen-4 (VLA-4), that participate in cellular recruitment,
   interaction, and lymphocyte activation during in vitro activation of
   acutely and chronically infected spleen and liver granuloma lymphocytes.
   Blockade of ICAM-1, LFA-1, or VLA-4 by rat monoclonal antibody inhibited
   spleen and granuloma lymphocyte interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4 production
   as well as lymphoproliferative responses at similar levels (66 to 87\%).
   The down-modulated cytokine and proliferative responses of chronically
   infected lymphocytes were inhibited to the same extent as their acutely
   infected counterparts. Cell sorting analysis demonstrated that acutely
   and chronically infected splenic and granuloma lymphocytes expressed
   similar levels of LFA-1, ICAM-1, and VLA-4 and that more ICAM-1 was
   expressed on infected than on uninfected mouse lymphocytes. By exposure
   of cells to paired monoclonal antibodies at suboptimal doses, it was
   determined that whereas all three adhesion molecules may participate,
   only ICAM-1 and LFA-1 showed synergistic interactions in determining
   lymphocyte responsiveness. These data suggest that spleen and liver
   granuloma lymphocytes are equally well armed with functional adhesion
   receptors. Thus, ICAM-1, LFA-1, and VLA-4 play an important accessory
   role in inflammatory cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation,
   and therefore these adhesion molecules may participate in the initiation
   and maintenance of the granulomatous inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To develop a more thorough understanding of the factors that
   impede poor parents' utilization of health care services for their
   children and to refine interventions to improve immunization rates.
   Methods: We conducted focus group sessions with mothers whose children
   received care at the health departments in five North Carolina counties.
   Mothers were uninsured or were receiving Medicaid. A total of 50 women
   participated; group size varied from three to seven mothers.
   Results: Socially disadvantaged mothers faced barriers at multiple
   points in the process of obtaining preventive care for their children.
   Organizational barriers, such as a lack of flexibility in scheduling and
   long waiting times, were exacerbated by personal barriers, such as a
   lack of reliable transportation, chaotic home environments, and
   employment conflicts. Lack of knowledge regarding the timing of
   childhood immunizations and misperceptions about the safety of
   immunizations were also important obstacles. Mothers made several
   suggestions, such as changes in scheduling, greater assistance with
   transportation, improved waiting facilities, and increased health
   education.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that even with improved financing of
   well-child care, many important barriers to adequate immunization will
   remain. Many of the changes that mothers in our focus groups advocated
   are not related to insurance coverage and would be simple and
   inexpensive to implement. To help with these changes, we developed a
   checklist for use by health departments to determine which
   organizational barriers exist at their facility and suggest strategies
   to overcome the problems. Organizational, personal, and attitudinal
   barriers pose serious problems for socioeconomically disadvantaged
   families. To improve vaccination rates for children, new personnel and
   programs are probably less important than careful strategies to maximize
   exisiting resources.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that the eye-blink startle reflex can be
   modulated by changes in affective state. The purpose of the present
   study was to determine whether human perioral and trigemino-laryngeal
   reflexes are sensitive to affective state changes. Impetus for this
   study comes from theories suggesting that orolaryngeal reflexes may be
   modulated by affective states, and as such influence voice and speech
   production. Subjects were 24 classically trained female sopranos (21-35
   years). Each produced a pursing lip posture while sustaining the
   continuant /m/ at 440 Hz and at a comfortable voice intensity level.
   Simultaneously subjects were shown an aversive, pleasant, or neutral
   slide (experimental conditions) or no slide (control condition) and
   received unanticipated, servo-controlled mechanical taps to the midline
   upper lip. Perioral responses were recorded bilaterally from the
   orbicularis oris inferior (OOI) muscle using surface electromyography
   (EMG). Trigemino-laryngeal responses were obtained indirectly by
   measuring changes in the voltage analog of the voice fundamental
   frequency (VFO). Reflex responses were detected by smoothing and
   signal-averaging the VFO and rectified EMG signals. Response magnitude
   and latency measures were compared across the affective valence and
   no-slide conditions. Statistically significant differences were not
   observed between conditions for the magnitude or temporal measures of
   either reflex. Significant differences, independent of affective
   valence, were observed between right and left early excitatory perioral
   response magnitudes. Differences between the startle and orolaryngeal

Abstract = {{In the current generation of global dispersion maps of surface waves,
   the long-wavelength structure seems to be very well determined. There is
   general agreement in the patterns of global phase velocity anomalies up
   to harmonic degree l similar or equal to 6. However, the
   shorter-wavelength structure varies significantly between published
   maps, and it appears that this part of the models depends strongly on
   the inversion technique and on the data set of surface-wave dispersion
   (usually phase measurements). Polarization data depend on the lateral
   gradient of phase velocity and hence are more sensitive to
   shorter-wavelength structure than phase data; thus, including these data
   should enhance resolution. In this paper, I demonstrate that
   polarization data of long-period surface waves (greater than or equal to
   80 s), as a function of frequency, can be reliably measured using a
   multitaper technique. The resulting off-great-circle arrival angles of
   the surface-wave packets are relatively easy to interpret within a
   ray-theoretical framework. Our data base of three-component recordings
   is now large enough to provide useful constraints on global dispersion
   maps, particularly on the shorter-wavelength parts. Apart from the phase
   velocity model itself, a possible misorientation of the horizontal
   components at each station is included in a non-linear inversion as an
   additional independent model parameter. This gives a significant
   improvement in the fit to the data. Misorientations of more than 3
   degrees are probable for at least four of the 37 stations investigated.

Abstract = {{Background. There is increasing political pressure on the medical
   profession to approach welfare diseases, such as coronary heart disease
   and diabetes, through prevention. General practitioners are required to
   offer regular health checks to healthy people, in spite of the lack of
   scientific evidence for the universal need, usefulness and side effects
   of such an intervention. Randomized controlled trials are needed.
   Aim. A study was carried out to investigate people's interest in
   participating in health checks and in discussions about health with
   their own general practitioner, participants' health status, the
   proportion who received health advice following health checks, and the
   lifestyle goals they set following discussion with their general
   practitioner. This study reports the baseline data from a five-year
   randomized, controlled, prospective, population-based study in general
   practices in Ebeltoft, Denmark.
   Method. All general practitioners from the four practices in Ebeltoft
   and a random sample of 2000 people aged between 30 and 50 years were
   invited to participate. Participants were randomly divided into three
   groups one control group and two intervention groups. One intervention
   group were given a health check which included being screened for
   cardiovascular risk factors, lung and liver function, fitness, sight and
   hearing and an optional test for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV);
   this group received written feedback from the general practitioner. The
   other intervention group were also given a health check and written
   feedback; in addition, they were given the opportunity to attend their
   general practitioner to discuss preventive health.
   Results. A total of 1370 people participated in the study (69\% response
   rate). Health advice was given to 76\% of 905 participants following
   health checks. Almost all of the 456 participants (96\%) who were
   offered the opportunity of discussing their health with their general
   practitioner took up the offer; 64\% of the 456 participants reported
   that they had decided to undertake lifestyle changes. Eleven of those
   who discussed their health with the doctor were referred to a specialist
   (2\%).
   Conclusion. There was considerable interest in participating in health
   promotion. Three out of four of those having a health check were given
   health advice. Two out of three of those offered a health talk with the
   general practitioner appeared willing to make relevant lifestyle
   changes. Longterm follow up is needed to determine effects and side
   effects of health checks and health talks.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled laboratory freezing tests were carried out on dormant apricot
   (Prunus armeniaca L.) shoots preconditioned to attain maximum cold
   hardiness. Determinations were made of the temperatures required to kill
   50\% of the flower buds {[}T-50 (FB)] and 50\% of the shoot xylem
   {[}T-50 (SX)]. The 27 genotypes in this study differed significantly
   from each other in T-50 (FB) and T-50 (SX). Using `Goldcot' as the
   climatically adapted hardy standard, 27 genotypes were placed in three
   hardiness classes; those more hardy than `Goldcot,' those equally hardy
   as `Goldcot' and those less hardy than `Goldcot'. The mean T-50 (FB) was
   28.7C and the mean T-50 (SX) was -35.3C, indicating that shoot xylem
   hardiness of apricots was at least several degrees greater than flower
   bud hardiness. The range in newer bud hardiness among the 27 genotypes
   was 2.8C while that for shoot xylem hardiness was 6.7C. Seven genotypes
   had hardier flower buds than `Goldcot' including two named Harrow
   cultivars ('Harlayne' and `Haggith'), four numbered Harrow selections
   (H7814180, HW-446, H8205044 and HW460) and one other cultivar
   ('Manchu'). Among 16 genotypes equally bud hardy as `Goldcot,' four were
   named narrow cultivars ('Harcot,' `Harglow,' `Hargrand' and `Harogem')
   and eight were numbered Harrow selections. One named Harrow cultivar
   ('Hag-gith') was more wood hardy than `Goldcot'; while three Harrow
   cultivars ('Harlayne,' `Harcot' and `Hargrand') and seven numbered
   Harrow selections were equally wood hardy. The goal of breeding apricot
   cultivars equal to or more cold hardy than `Goldcot' was achieved
   because bud hardiness of six of the seven Harrow introductions was equal
   to or greater than `Goldcot.' The potential breeding value of the 14
   named cultivars was estimated by using their total long term performance
   ratings for 14 attributes, then applying the bud and wood hardiness
   classifications made here as additional factors. The ranking of breeding
   value for the 14 named cultivars from highest to lowest was as follows:
   `Harlayne' > `Harcot' = `Hargrand' = `Harval' > `Harglow' = `Harogem' >
   `J.L. Budd' > `Manchu' > `Gibbs' = `Sunglo' > `Haggith' = `Veecot' >
   `Stella' > `Goldcot.' The potential breeding value of the six named
   Harrow introductions for the fresh market exceeded that of the eight
   other cultivars, including `Veecot' and `Goldcot,' the two commercial
   standards. Consequently, they warrant greater use as parents and wider
   testing as cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic models of the urine concentrating mechanism consist of large
   systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations, with stiff source
   terms, coupled with fluid conservation relations. Efforts to solve these
   equations numerically with explicit methods have been frustrated by
   numerical instability and by long computation times. As a consequence,
   most models have been reformulated as steady-state boundary value
   problems, which have usually been solved by an adaptation of Newton's
   method. Nonetheless, difficulties arise in finding conditions that lead
   to stable convergence, especially when the very large membrane
   permeabilities measured in experiments are used. In this report, an
   explicit method, previously introduced to solve the model equations of a
   single renal tubule, is extended to solve a large-scale model of the
   urine concentrating mechanism, This explicit method tracks concentration
   profiles in the upwind direction and thereby avoids instability arising
   from flow reversal. To attain second-order convergence in space and
   time: the recently developed ENO (essentially non-oscillatory)
   methodology is implemented, The method described here, which has been
   rendered practical for renal models by the emergence of desktop
   workstations, is adaptable to various medullary geometries and permits
   the inclusion of experimentally measured permeabilities. This report
   describes an implementation of the method, makes comparisons with
   results obtained previously by a different method, and presents an
   example calculation using some recently measured membrane properties.}},

Abstract = {{THIS STUDY investigated the implications of signifying, a form of social
   discourse in the African-American community, as a scaffold for teaching
   skills in literary interpretation. This investigation is related to the
   larger question of the efficacy of culturally sensitive instruction. The
   major premise on which the hypotheses of this study are based is the
   proposal that African American adolescents who are skilled in signifying
   use certain strategies to process signifying dialogue. These strategies
   are comparable to those that expert readers use in order to construct
   inferences about figurative passages in narrative texts. In order to
   apply this premise, an instructional unit was designed aimed at helping
   students bring to a conscious level the strategies it is presumed they
   use tacitly in social discourse. This approach is offered as a model of
   cognitive apprenticing based on cultural foundations. Analyses are
   presented of how the cultural practice links to heuristic strategies
   that experts use in a specific domain, as well as how instructors
   modeled, coached, and scaffolded students.}},

Abstract = {{Setting: An evaluation of the Tuberculosis Control Programme (TBCP) of
   KaNgwane, a rural, previously designated `homeland' of South Africa, was
   performed in 1990.
   Objective: The evaluation is presented as a case study to illustrate a
   proposed methodology for rapid, comprehensive, management oriented TBCP
   research.
   Design: The components of the TBCP were categorised into direct TBCP
   activities, management processes and integration of the TBCP into
   Primary Health Care (PHC). The methods used to evaluate indicators for
   each of these components included: policy analysis, interviews with
   staff and patients, observation of in-patient and ambulatory patient
   care, record reviews and a household survey.
   Results: The regional scope of the study yielded a wealth of useful
   information at a managerial level. Detailed, quantitative information
   was obtained, allowing for the identification of weaknesses in the TBCP
   and the targeting of appropriate action. Particularly problematic
   aspects were: the health information collection, case-finding and
   case-holding, health education and coordination and supervision.
   Comparative analyses between different health wards helped identify
   particular areas of weakness. Both illustrative results and
   methodological limitations are presented. The methodology used is
   related to previous South African TB health service research and to the
   emerging field of rapid assessment methods.
   Conclusions: A rapid but comprehensive review of a TBCP can be done if
   indicators and research methods are carefully selected and record
   systems are functional. If record systems are not functional, the
   non-record review methods still offer substantial information on many
   indicators and one or two quantitative indicators (e.g. case holding)
   could be selectively measured through reviewing a sample of records.}},

Abstract = {{A nabumetone tablet in development (Nabuton(R)) was tested for its

   Korean male subjects participated in this study. Each subject received a
   1-g dose of nabumetone (2 tablets each) in an unbalanced, randomized,
   two-way crossover investigation. Serum concentrations of
   6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-MNA), a major metabolite of
   nabumetone, were measured over 120 hr interval by a high-performance
   liquid chromatography. The maximum serum concentration (C-max) and time
   to reach the maximum concentration (T-max) were read directly, but area
   under the serum concentration time curve from time 0 to 120 hr (AUG) and
   mean residence time (MRT) of 6-MNA were calculated from the serum 6-MNA
   concentration-time curves. The serum curves showed multiple peaks of
   6-MNA in most subjects, and the C-max and T-max were read from the
   highest serum peaks. Calculated bioavailability parameters for test and
   reference tablets were 1498.6:1377.9 mu g . hr/ml for AUC; 25.2:23.1 mu
   g/ml for C-max; 11.8:16.4 hr for T-max, and 42.6:43.8 hr for MRT,
   respectively. The paired t-test revealed no significant differences in
   all the parameters between the two tablets. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   revealed no significant differences between groups and formulations in
   all the parameters (C-max, T-max AUC and MRT) indicating the crossover
   design of the experiment was properly performed. But significant
   differences (p<0.05) between subject/groups and periods were found for
   ail the parameters indicating substantial intersubject and interperiodic
   variations for these parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a differentiated B-cell
   malignancy which is usually less responsive to standard chemotherapy
   because of low-proliferating cells. Interferon alpha has been shown to
   possess a therapeutic action in numerous B-cell malignancies including
   the early stage of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma,
   follicular lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia. Fourteen patients with
   progressive WM were included in a pilot study using very low dose of
   interferon alpha-2a (1 Million Units 3 times a week). The mean duration
   of treatment was 10.3 months (range 2-44). Six of 14 (42\%) patients
   presented an increase in the hemoglobin level (greater than or equal to
   0.9g/dL) and 4/14 (28\%) had a substantial decrease of the monoclonal
   component (greater than or equal to 20\% of reduction). Only two
   patients presented both types of response, while the others with an
   increase in the hemoglobin level had a slight decrease in the monoclonal
   component (MC) (1 patient), a stable MC (1 patient) or a slight increase
   of MC (1 patient). One additional patient had a 15\% decrease of the MC
   with a stable hemoglobin level. Response was observed within 3 months
   with a median duration of 6 months. Treatment was stopped for 3 patients
   because of flu-like symptoms (2 patients), or thrombocytopenia (1
   patient). Follow up was possible in 12 patients lasting up to a maximum
   of 30 months after discontinuing treatment, Seven patients died,
   including 4 with progressive disease, two of infection and one of
   cardiac failure. In the view of these results, very low dose of
   interferon alpha may constitute a new approach for treatment of some
   cases of WM.}},

Abstract = {{An analytic-numerical model has been developed to study kinematic
   coagulation caused by the vibrational motion of charged particles in an
   alternating electric field. The primary aim of this study was to find
   out the reduction in the number concentration of fine particles of
   diameter 0.1 mu m-1.0 mu m caused by collisions with larger, supermicron
   particles. Three cases are considered: (1) unipolar charging, (2) fine
   particles are neutral, and (3) fine particles and large particles have
   opposite polarity. We find out that in cases 1 and 2 the rate of
   kinematic coagulation in negligible and in case 3 significant. The
   results are demonstrated with two sample calculations with total mass
   loadings of 2 and 20 g/m(3). In the former, where the mass median
   diameter is 3.0 mu m, we discover a 20\%-50\% reduction in number
   concentration of particles in the range 0.5-1.0 mu m and less
   significant reduction in smaller particles. The latter (MMD = 6.0 mu m)
   represents power plant conditions. In this case the reduction varies
   from 10\% (0.1 mu m) to 95\% (1.0 mu m).}},

Abstract = {{Interleukin-11 is a stromal cells derived cytokine which stimulates the
   proliferation of primitive haemopoietic progenitor cells. For this paper
   we have studied the constitutive expression of IL-11 mRNA in a panel of
   well-known leukaemic cell lines and samples from AML patients at
   diagnosis. Moreover, the same cellular populations were evaluated for
   their proliferative response to recombinant-human-(r-hu) IL-11 alone and
   combined with r-hu-IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
   factor (GM-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCE, c-kit ligand). The
   colony-forming ability of HL60, K562, KG1 cells and eight fresh AML cell
   populations was assessed by a clonogenic assay in methylcellulose. In
   eight additional AML cases the number of S-phase leukaemic cells induced
   by IL-11 was determined by the bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) incorporation
   assay after 3 d of liquid culture.
   IL-11, as single cytokine, did not stimulate the colony formation of the
   three myeloid cell lines under serum-containing and serum-free
   conditions. In contrast, the proliferation of the leukaemic cells in
   response to IL-3, GM-CSF and SCF was enhanced by co-incubation with
   IL-11, and this effect was reversed in blocking experiments by the
   anti-IL-11 Moab. When tested on primary AML samples, IL-11 alone showed
   little, if any, proliferative activity. However, it increased the
   IL-3-dependent blast colony formation in eight out of eight cases and
   GM-CSF in seven cases. IL-11 also augmented synergistically the number
   of CFU-L stimulated by SCF in seven cases. A combination of three
   factors (1L-11 SCF and IL-3) yielded optimal colony formation. The BRDU
   studies showed the significant increase of AML cells in S-phase when
   IL-11 was combined with SCF, whereas the two CSF had no activity on
   their own. Positive interaction was also observed when IL-11 was added
   to IL-3 supplemented cultures in five out of eight cases tested. Reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR)
   demonstrated the constitutive expression of IL-11 mRNA in all the cell
   lines and 11/12 AML samples studied at diagnosis.
   These results indicate that IL-11 is expressed in leukaemic myeloid
   cells and that their proliferation is regulated by the cytokine which
   acts as a synergistic factor.}},

Abstract = {{In situ hybridization, Northern blotting, and immunohistochemical
   techniques were used to study the expression of transforming growth
   factor beta 1 (TGF beta(1)) in the endometrium of the mare during the
   first 150 days of pregnancy (term = 330-340 days).
   In situ hybridization using an oligonucleotide (45mer) probe, based on a
   homologous region within all known mammalian TGF beta(1) DNA sequences,
   demonstrated TGF beta(1) mRNA accumulation in the glandular and lumenal
   epithelial cells of the endometrium from day 33 onwards which
   corresponds to the time of implantation (day 33-45). Expression in the
   endometrium remained at a high level to the end of the sampling period
   (day 150). There was also marked expression of TGF beta(1) in the
   mononuclear cells accumulated around the periphery of the specialized
   trophoblast cells of the endometrial cup within the endometrium and in
   the mononuclear cells accumulated in the endometrial stroma of mares
   carrying failing donkey-in-horse pregnancies created by embryo transfer.
   The sense (control) oligonucleotide probe exhibited no hybridization to
   any tissue at any stage. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the
   oligonucleotide probe and a porcine TGF beta(1) cDNA clone hybridized to
   a single 2.5 kb transcript in horse endometrial and lymphocyte RNA, thus
   validating the oligonucleotide probe for detection of horse TGF beta(1)
   mRNA. Furthermore, both probes demonstrated an increased signal in the
   pregnant endometrium from day 33 onwards, thereby confirming the in situ
   hybridization results. Immunostaining with a specific anti-bovine TGF
   beta(1) serum also showed increasing TGF beta(1) accumulation in
   endometrial epithelia during pregnancy, and localization of the protein
   in endometrial stroma and in the trophoblast layer of the placenta after
   day 60 of pregnancy.
   These results show that TGF beta(1) expression increases in the maternal
   endometrium of the mare at the time of implantation and that it may play
   a role in regulating endometrial and/or trophoblast growth and
   differentiation during placentation in this species. It may also
   influence fetal development (via placental transfer) at a later stage of
   gestation. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Most savanna water balance models assume water partitioning between
   grasses and shrubs in a two-layer hypothesis, but this hypothesis has
   not been tested for humid savanna environments. Spatial partitioning of
   soil water between grasses and shrubs was investigated in a West African
   humid savanna by comparing the isotopic composition (oxygen-18 and
   deuterium) of soil water and plant stem water during rainy and dry
   conditions. Both grass and shrub species acquire most of their water
   from the top soil layer during both rainy and dry periods. A shift of
   water uptake pattern towards deeper horizons was observed only at the
   end of the dry season after shrub defoliation. The mean depth of water
   uptake, as determined by the isotopic signature of stem water, was
   consistent with grass and shrub root profiles and with changes in soil
   water content profiles as surveyed by a neutron probe. This provides
   evidence for potentially strong competition between shrubs and grasses
   for soil water in these humid savannas. Limited nutrient availability
   may explain these competitive interactions. These results enhance our
   understanding of shrub-grass interactions, and will contribute to models
   of ecosystem functioning in humid savannas.}},

Abstract = {{Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been used experimentally and
   clinically to suppress a variety of physiological events, including
   angiogenesis and formation of bone. The exact mechanisms by which
   indomethacin alters skeletal tissue generation are unknown, due in part
   to methodological limitations. By the use of an organ culture assay and
   an animal model using intravital microscopy in mice bearing dorsal
   skinfold chambers, the effect of indomethacin on growth and angiogenesis
   of neonatal femora was characterized over 16 days. In both assays,
   femora significantly elongated with time(P<0.05). The in vitro growth
   rate was more rapid than in vivo and dependent on the serum
   concentration, culture medium and age of mice. Although enhancing the
   serum content promoted cellular proliferation in organ culture, it
   dose-dependently suppressed femoral elongation, leading at 20\% fetal
   calf serum to growth rates identical to those observed in vivo.
   Indomethacin supplementation (2 and 10 mg l(-1)) significantly
   accelerated longitudinal femoral growth in organ culture (P<0.05),
   whereas in vivo indomethacin (2 mg kg(-1)) did not modulate either
   angiogenesis or elongation of bone. Our in vitro data propose a central
   role of serum in the regulation of bone formation. Although indomethacin
   altered femoral,oowth in vitro, our findings do not suggest that
   indomethacin suppresses angiogenesis or growth of bone in vivo. The
   complexity of physiological events in vivo may be obscuring a detectable
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel technique that can be used to measure the
   frequency response of an optical phase modulator, An interesting feature
   of this technique is that it does not require the use of an
   interferometer for phase-to-amplitude conversion, thus alleviating
   stability and alignment problems, Instead, the electro-optically induced
   birefringence of the modulator and a simple polarizer are used to
   transform phase modulation into intensity modulation, The latter is
   detected with a high-speed photodiode and, for a sinusoidal modulating

Abstract = {{A microcomputer-based fish monitor has been used to evaluate the effect
   of selected inorganic nutrients and Tributyltin Oxide (TBTO) on the
   electric organ discharge (EOD) of two species of elephant fish, namely
   Gnathonenus petersi and G. tamandua (family: Mormyridae). Significant
   EOD responses to dosing concentrations as low as 1.0mg/l ammonia
   (NH4-N), 0.05mg/l phosphate (PO4-P) and 0.01mg/l TBTO are recorded by
   both species, with response times within a 15-45 minute range. No
   response, however, was recorded to concentrations within a range of
   10-75mg/l Nitrate (NO3-N). This should reduce the instance of `false
   alarms' for which such systems are renowned. These findings add further
   credibility to the potential of these fish for use as indicators of
   chemical changes in water quality.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of a plane shock wave that propagates in an air media and

   shock waves from the parabolic reflectors with different depths and to
   analyze their associated flow fields in detail. The present solver
   developed is to solve the Euler equations using an improved, implicit,
   upwind Total Variation Diminishing scheme in a finite-volume approach.
   The effects of reflectors with different depths and of the incident
   shock Mach numbers on shock focusing are investigated. The real-gas
   effect is taken into account through a proper correction of the specific
   heat ratio of air, when high temperature occurs due to shock focusing.}},

Abstract = {{The additive-multiplicative hazard model specifies that the hazard
   function for the counting process associated with a multidimensional

   (beta(0)(T), <gamma(0)(T))(T) is a vector of unknown regression
   parameters, g and h are known link functions and lambda(0) is an
   unspecified `'baseline hazard function.'' In this paper, we develop a
   class of simple estimating functions for theta(0), which contains the
   partial likelihood score function in the special case of proportional
   hazards models. The resulting estimators are shown to be consistent and
   asymptotically normal under appropriate regularity conditions. Weak
   convergence of the Aalen-Breslow type estimators for the cumulative
   baseline hazard function Lambda(0)(t) = integral(0)(t) lambda(0)(u) du
   is also established. Furthermore, we construct adaptive estimators for

Abstract = {{The stress-distress model is examined in the context of a Chinese urban
   center, Tianjin. Conceptually, the relationship between stress (as
   reflected in life events) and distress (as reflected in depressed
   symptoms) is hypothesized to hold across societies. At the same time,
   the measures of stress must reflect the social reality of a particular
   community of society. In the case of urban China, the
   politically-imposed stratification system arranges individuals and
   family lives around work units. These work units dictate all aspects of
   the life of the worker and his or her family, ranging from housing,
   major purchases, access to local and distance facilities, schooling and
   employment for children, to retirement pension and funeral expenses. As
   a result, relationships in the work context are expected to produce
   stress-inducing conflicts. Results from a community survey of Tianjin
   residents in 1986 support both the generality of the stress-distress
   model and the specificity of the effects of work-related stressors.}},

   starting cancer therapy. Dynamic scanning was performed for 40 min in
   seven patients and 10-20 min in three patients 25-45 min postinjection.
   Results: Carbon-11-methionine PET detected all melanoma lesions greater

Abstract = {{Expert critics have been built to critique human performance in various
   areas such as engineering design, decision making, etc. We suggest that
   critics can also be useful in the building and use of knowledge-based
   design systems (KBDSs).
   Knowledge engineers elicit knowledge from domain experts and build a
   knowledge-based design system. The system generates designs. The amount
   of knowledge the system possesses and the way it applies the knowledge
   directly influence the performance of ifs designs. Therefore, critics
   are proposed to assist 1) acquiring sufficient knowledge for
   constructing a desirable system, and 2) applying proper knowledge to
   generating designs. Methodologies of equipping a KBDS with critics are
   developed. Our practice in building and using a KBDS shows the
   applicability and capability of these critics.}},

Abstract = {{Blocking regimes simulated in a spectral 3-level quasi-geostrophic model
   have been examined and compared with observations. A control experiment
   and perturbation experiments have been performed using different
   constant and time-varying external forcing fields. The main emphasis of
   this paper is to determine the signal to noise ratio of the effects of
   anomalous external forcing and the natural variations in blocking
   activity. Forcing the model with the climatological winter mean external
   forcing, a control experiment has been carried out for 500 winters. The
   model simulates accurately the structure of the blocking pattern, as
   well as its effect on the transient weather systems. It also produces
   approximately the same number of blocking days as in the observations.
   However, the average duration of the simulated blocking regimes is about
   one day shorter than the observed one. The interannual variability in
   blocking activity is similar to the observations. The model also
   produces substantial long-term variations in blocking activity on a
   time-scale of decades. The observed climatological intraseasonal
   variations in the external forcing field appear to have a negligible
   effect on the mean blocking activity and its interannual variability.
   Observed interannual changes in the forcing configuration significantly
   affect the probability for a blocking circulation to occur. However, if
   we include the year-to-year changes in external forcing, the model
   generates only slightly larger interannual variations in blocking
   activity as compared to the control experiment with constant
   climatological forcing. So it seems that the observed interannual
   variability of blocking in winter is predominantly internally generated
   and changes in external forcing fields are of secondary importance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Choice of perioperative analgesia may affect the rate of
   recovery of gastrointestinal function and thus duration and cost of
   hospitalization after colonic surgery.
   Methods: Fifty-four patients undergoing partial colectomy surgery were
   randomized into four groups. All groups received a standardized general
   anesthetic. Group MB received a preoperative bolus of epidural
   bupivacaine and morphine followed by an infusion of morphine and
   bupivacaine. Group M received a preoperative bolus of epidural morphine
   followed by an infusion of morphine. Group B received a preoperative
   bolus of bupivacaine followed by an infusion of bupivacaine, Group P
   received a preoperative bolus of intravenous morphine followed by
   intravenous patient-controlled morphine postoperatively. All patients
   participated in a standardized recovery program to minimize the
   influence of nonanalgesic factors on recovery of gastrointestinal
   function. All epidural groups were double-blinded. All patients were
   deemed ready for discharge according to prospectively defined criteria.
   Results: Groups B and MB reported superior analgesia with activity (P <
   0.01). Group M had a greater incidence of pruritus (P < 0.05). Group B
   had a greater incidence of orthostatic hypotension (P = 0.04). Groups B
   and MB recovered gastrointestinal function and fulfilled discharge
   criteria approximately 1.5 days earlier than groups M and P (P < 0.005).
   Conclusions: Epidural analgesia with bupivacaine and morphine provided
   the best balance of analgesia and side effects while accelerating
   postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function and time to
   fulfillment of discharge criteria after colon surgery in relatively
   healthy patients within the context of a multimodal recovery program.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium is known to cause sea urchin blastomeres destined to give rise
   to epithelium rather than to differentiate into gut or skeleton. While
   it has been proposed that lithium alters development by interfering with
   the inositol-tris phosphate-protein kinase C (IP3-PKC) signaling
   pathway, the mechanism of action of lithium-in sea urchins has remained
   elusive. Here we describe experiments that examine the hypothesis that
   lithium exerts its effect on sea urchin embryos via the IP3-PKC pathway.
   We make use of methods developed to isolate epithelial precursor cells
   from the animal hemisphere of cleavage 16-cell stage embryos. Pairs of
   cells were isolated and one of each pair was injected with either
   myo-inositol or its inactive isomer, epi-inositol. Rhodamine dextran was
   co-injected as a lineage tracer to follow the fate of injected cells. We
   demonstrate that injected myo-inositol, but not epi-inositol, can
   reverse the effects of lithium on sea urchin blastomeres. This is direct
   evidence that lithium affects the IP3-PKC pathway in sea urchins, and
   that this pathway plays an important role in cell fate determination.}},

   and that, for linear polymers of a given molecular weight M, {[}tau] is
   inversely proportional to the self-diffusion coefficient D in a liquid

   determine the strand concentration v. Literature data for molten

   approximate superposition of the curves for sigma/G(0) vs gamma/D, where

Abstract = {{Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been adapted as a standard for
   providing nutrition to ill term and preterm infants. The availability of
   tyrosine in amino acid preparations utilized for TPN is limited and may
   potentiate a tyrosine-deficient state. Phenlyalanine hydroxylase
   activity, responsible for catalyzing tyrosine synthesis, has been
   suggested to be decreased in fetal and neonatal animals. Parenterally
   nourished premature rabbits (n=16) and suckled rabbits (n=19) were
   studied in order to compare growth parameters and amino acids in the
   plasma and brain, as well as whole brain catecholamine concentrations.
   Influx velocities into the brain of amino acids were also determined in
   these two groups.
   The preterm rabbit's average birth weight (42.6+/-6.0) was less than
   that of term rabbits (56.7+/-8.7, P<0.005). Significantly lower
   concentrations of the catecholamine precursor tyrosine were found in
   both the plasma and brain of the parenterally nourished animals compared
   to the suckled animals. Tyrosine is reduced in the brain in
   TPN-supported animals reflecting both low tyrosine intake and increased
   plasma concentrations of large neutral amino acids that compete for
   uptake at the blood-brain barrier. However, no difference was observed
   between the two groups in their brain catecholamine concentrations.
   The seven-day parenterally nourished rabbit appears to be
   tyrosine-deficient but no evident effects on brain catecholamine
   concentrations were seen. The effects and impact of a tyrosine-deficient
   state might better be evaluated by regional evaluation of
   catecholaminergic areas of the brain or over a longer period of
   parenteral nutrition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a summary of the findings and recommendations of the
   studies of severe, sustained drought reported in this special issue. The
   management facilities and institutions were found to be effective in
   protecting consumptive water users against drought, but much less
   effective in protecting nonconsumptive uses. Changes in intrastate water
   management were found to be effective in reducing the monetary value of
   damages, through reallocating shortages to low-valued uses, while only
   water banking and water marketing, among the possible interstate rule
   changes, were similarly effective. Players representing the basin states
   and the federal government in three gaming experiments were unable to
   agree upon and effect major changes in operating rules. The conclusions
   are (1) that nonconsumptive water uses are highly vulnerable to drought,
   (2) that consumptive uses are well-protected, (3) that drought risk is
   greatest in the Upper Basin, (4) that the Lower Basin suffers from
   chronic water shortage but bears little drought risk, (5) that
   opportunities exist for win-win rule changes, (6) that such role changes
   are extremely difficult to make, and (7) that intrastate drought

Abstract = {{In order to make a direct evaluation of adhesives used in bond welding
   in the automobile industry we used the so-called `'black box'' approach.
   In this case we only know the trade name of the adhesive but not any
   further information about the raw materials. To obtain information from
   the thermal behavior of adhesives, we conducted thermoanalytical
   experiments in an inert atmosphere and coupled thermal analysis/mass
   spectrometry. Modelling the real situation in bond welding, we made
   pyrolysis experiments in the German VCI-oven in air. The volatile and
   semivolatile products of pyrolysis were collected on XAD-resins and
   after elution, qualitative and quantitative determinations were carried
   out by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. According to black box
   theory, the results (output) were referred to adhesive type used
   (input). This approach is not restricted to investigating adhesives, but
   can be applied to all cases where high temperature must be used in the
   presence of organic materials. The adhesive types investigated were
   three epoxy resins, one component polyurethane and one
   butyl-chaoutchouc.}},

   MODERATE TO SEVERE SYMPTOMS OF BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We developed a decision analytic model to compare the costs
   of treatment for an initial 2-year period with finasteride, terazosin,
   and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in men with at least
   moderate symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Outcome
   measures were BPH treatment costs, duration of symptomatic improvement,
   and lost productivity days (work or other customary activity).
   Methods. Patterns of health care resource use associated with the
   treatment of moderate to severe BPH and BPH-related complications were
   evaluated by a survey of urologists and validated by a urology consensus
   panel. BPH safety and efficacy studies in the published literature were
   used to provide probabilities of treatment success. Both a national
   health care resource database (Systemetrics) and Medicare data were used
   to estimate the costs of specific health care services (such as
   physician services and laboratory tests).
   Results. The probabilities of first-year success (defined as symptomatic
   improvement) for surgery, finasteride, and terazosin were 88\%, 67\%,
   and 74\%, respectively. The most expensive intervention was surgery,
   followed by finasteride and terazosin, at estimated 24-month costs of
   \$6411, \$2860, and \$2422 for private insurance and \$3874, \$2161, and
   \$1820 for Medicare, respectively. Duration of symptom improvement was
   comparable for the three treatments. Estimates of usual activity days
   lost (work or other customary activity) were 22, 8, and 8 days for
   surgery, finasteride, and terazosin, respectively.
   Conclusions, As a primary intervention for patients considering
   conventional clinical approaches to BPH treatment, pharmacotherapy is
   expected to be less expensive than TURF over the initial 2 years of
   therapy.}},

   Although not all affected family members showed myokymia on clinical

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been discovered in 1989 and is probably the
   most common cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular
   carcinoma. HCV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, 9,4
   kilobases in length. The genetic organisation and the properties of
   viral proteins have been characterized. At least 50 HCV genotypes or
   subtypes have been identified. Genotypes 1, 2 and 3 are the most
   commonly observed in patients from Europe and USA. Genotype I is more
   resistant to interferon treatment. The hypervariability of HCV is
   responsible, within a single patient, of the existence of a spectrum of
   very closely-related genomes reffered as quasispecies that may be a
   mechanism of escape from the immune response and may explain chronicity.
   Virological diagnosis of HCV infection is based on the detection of
   anti-HCV antibodies by ELISA. In some cases (acute hepatitis, problems
   in the interpretation of ELISA tests, or in immunosuppressed patients),
   it is necessary to search for HCV RNA using genomic amplification or
   amplification of hybridization. These technics can also be usefull to
   predict the response to interferon, as it has been demonstrated that
   patients with low viremia are better responders than others. HCV RNA
   detection or quantification could also be usefull to follow the
   efficiency of anti-viral drugs.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of a blocking anticyclone over the North Atlantic has been
   examined over its entire life-cycle using the Zwack-Okossi (Z-O)
   equation as the diagnostic tool. This blocking anticyclone occurred in
   late October and early November of 1985. The data used were provided by
   the NASA Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres on a global 2.0 degrees
   latitude by 2.5 degrees longitude grid. The horizontal distribution of
   the atmospheric forcing mechanisms that were important to 500 mb block
   formation, maintenance and decay were examined. A scale-partitioned form
   of the Z-O equation was then used to examine the relative importance of
   forcing on the planetary and synoptic scales, and their interactions. As
   seen in previous studies, the results presented here show that upper
   tropospheric anticyclonic vorticity advection was the most important
   contributor to block formation and maintenance. However, adiabatic
   warming, and vorticity tilting were also important at various times
   during the block lifetime. In association with precursor surface
   cyclogenesis, the 300 mb jet streak in the downstream (upstream) from a
   long-wave trough (ridge) amplified significantly. This strengthening of
   the jet streak enhanced the anticyclonic vorticity advection field that
   aided the amplification of a 500 mb short-wave ridge. The partitioned
   height tendency results demonstrate that the interactions between the
   planetary and synoptic-scale through vorticity advection was the most
   important contributor to block formation. Planetary-scale,
   synoptic-scale, and their interactions contributed weakly to the
   maintenance of the blocking anticyclone, with the advection of
   synoptic-scale vorticity by the planetary-scale flow playing a more
   important role. Planetary-scale decay of the long-wave ridge contributed
   to the demise of this blocking event.}},

Abstract = {{Baseline cellular plasminogen activator (PA) activity, and the cellular
   proteins responsible for variations in PA activity were evaluated in
   three human prostate carcinoma cell lines. Net PA activity in the cell
   lines PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP was measured using a plasminogen-dependent
   fibrin lysis assay. These three cell lines were then analyzed to
   determine the specific protein(s) responsible for differences in PA
   activity. mRNA and protein levels of cellular urinary PA (uPA), tissue
   PA (tPA), PA inhibitor 1 (PAI1), PA inhibitor 2 (PAI2), and uPA receptor
   (uPAr) were measured using Northern analysis and ELISA assays. Net
   cellular PA activity in the three cell lines varied over a 3-fold range
   (PC3 > DU145 much greater than LNCaP). Net PA activity in the
   fibrinolysis assay demonstrated a direct correlation with mRNA
   transcript levels of uPA, tPA, PAI1, and uPAr (PC-3 > DU-145 > LNCaP).
   uPA protein was identified in both the PC-3 and the DU-145 lines. tPA,
   PAI1, and PAI2 proteins were identified only in PC-3 cells. In general,
   cellular protein levels correlated with mRNA levels. These findings
   demonstrate that prostate carcinoma cell lines vary in their net PA
   activity. This variability results from both qualitative and
   quantitative differences in the cellular expression of PA regulatory
   proteins. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The need to provide women with a partner-independent method of
   prophylaxis against sexually transmitted disease (STD) agents, including
   Chlamydia trachomatis, has led to a directed effort to develop a
   vaginally applied, broad-spectrum antimicrobial preparation that is both
   safe and effective. Using a murine model of C. trachomatis lower genital
   tract infection, we tested the ability of various vaginally applied
   chemicals to alter the course of infection in female mice challenged
   with infectious doses ranging from 10(3) to 10(6) inclusion forming
   units of an oculogenital serovar of C. trachomatis. When administered in
   a methylcellulose/propylene glycol-based gel 15 minutes prior to
   challenge, four widely used topical antimicrobials (benzalkonium
   chloride, chlorhexidine, nonoxynol-9, and polymyxin B) were shown to
   protect against infection. These results support the possibility that
   this type of interventional method may be a clinically relevant means of
   prophylaxis against sexually transmitted infection with C. trachomatis,
   the most common bacterial STD agent.}},

Abstract = {{Coaching addresses (communications) delivered to players between breaks
   in competitive country and metropolitan Australian Rules football
   matches were examined from 36 country and metropolitan football clubs in
   major and intermediate level leagues in Victoria. Communication profiles
   of coaches revealed that <<sending solutions>> and <<commentary on
   performance>> were the two most utilised categories of communication
   style. The coaches of winning teams used fewer units of communication
   yet delivered more messages of praise and were more optimistic than the
   coaches of losing teams.
   In order to examine the likelihood of coaching communications affecting
   game outcome, the recovery rates and quarter-by-quarter fluctuations in
   game scores were examined. A <<progressive superiority>> hypothesis
   relating to performance was examined in relation to the <<communication
   potency>> argument (Madden, 1991). The results indicated that teams
   gaining an early lead in games typically maintain the lead and go on to
   win games. There was little fluctuation in scores from quarter to
   quarter. This finding was seen to be consistent with a <<sustained>>
   superiority interpretation of the results rather than in support of a
   <<progressive>> superiority hypothesis. It was concluded that the scope
   for the communication of coaches to affect game outcome is limited at
   this level of competition. Coaches may well be advised to re-direct
   their energy towards implementing strategies to establish <<early
   ascendancy>> in games, and to use breaks in play to work with players on
   an individual level rather than addressing the team as a unit.}},

   adsorptions, respectively) are observed for the larger buckytube. A
   temperature of 77 K is shown to be below the critical temperature for
   capillary condensation and above the critical temperature for layering
   transitions for both nitrogen and argon adsorption. A temperature of 55
   K is shown to be below the critical temperature for layering transitions
   for argon adsorption. Argon adsorption at 77 K in an open-ended
   mesoporous model buckytube is also presented. A comparison is made with

Abstract = {{High resolution magnetic resonance (MR) techniques combined with
   standard techniques of stereology and texture analysis have been used to
   quantify trabecular structure. Using dried excised specimens from the
   tibia (n = 10) and radius (n = 2) we evaluate the impact of using
   volumetric gradient-echo (GE) and spin-echo (SE) MR imaging sequences,
   the relative importance of echo time in gradient-echo MR imaging, and
   the impact of different threshold values to segment the bone and bone
   marrow on the estimation of trabecular bone structure. We also
   investigate the inter-relationships between the different structural
   parameters derived from MR images, Images were obtained using fast
   gradient echo and spin-echo imaging sequences, with TE values ranging
   from 7 to 17 ms using 4.7 and 1.5 Tesla imaging systems. In-plane image
   resolution ranged from 128 to 156 mu m, and slice thickness ranged from
   128 to 1000 mu m. We derived stereological measures such as the mean
   intercept length, trabecular width, fractional area of trabecular bone,
   trabecular number, and trabecular spacing, the fractal dimension as a
   texture-related parameter and the Euler number as a measure of
   connectivity from these images. We found that the mean intercept length
   as a function of angle traced an ellipse with the orientation of the
   principal axis of the ellipse, a measure of trabecular orientation,
   identical when measured from the spin echo or gradient-echo MR images,
   Absolute measures such as the fractional area, trabecular width,
   trabecular number, and fractal dimension as measured from gradient echo
   images were 28\%, 30\%, 1.3\%, and 0.6\% greater, respectively, than
   those calculated from spin-echo images, while the trabecular spacing was
   14\% less when calculated from gradient-echo images compared to
   spin-echo images. The structural parameters also depended on the echo
   time used to obtain the MR image. The choice of the threshold used to
   segment the high resolution images also affected the estimated
   structural parameters significantly, Our results indicate that MR may be
   used to visualize and quantify trabecular bone architecture; however,
   the different technical factors that could affect the appearance of MR
   images must be understood and considered in the data analysis and
   interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a priori estimation method is presented for calculating
   solution of convex optimization problems (COP) with some equality and/or
   inequality constraints by so-called Newton type homotopy method. The
   homotopy method is known as an efficient algorithm which can always
   calculate solution of nonlinear equations under a certain mild
   condition. Although, in general, it is difficult to estimate a priori
   computational complexity of calculating solution by the homotopy method.
   In the presented papers, a sufficient condition is considered for linear
   homotopy, under which an upper bound of the complexity can be estimated
   a priori. For the condition it is seen that Urabe type convergence
   theorem plays an important role. In this paper, by introducing the
   results, it is shown that under a certain condition a global minimum of
   COP can be always calculated, and that computational complexity of the
   calculation can be a priori estimated. Suitability of the estimation for
   analysing COP is also discussed.}},

   in the draining popliteal lymph node, which were entirely dependent on
   the presence of CD4(+) T cells. CD8(+) T cells did not proliferate in
   vitro even in the presence of the appropriate peptide epitope and
   exogenous interleukin (IL)-2. Primed popliteal lymph node cells produced
   IL-2, IL-5 and interferon (IFN)-gamma, but not IL-4 when restimulated
   with OVA in vitro. Serum antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibody
   responses were also primed by subcutaneous immunization with ISCOMS-OVA,
   confirming the stimulation of both Th1 and Th2 cells in vivo. Spleen
   cells from subcutaneously primed mice produced a similar pattern of
   cytokines, indicating that disseminated priming had occurred. Oral
   immunization with ISCOMS-OVA also primed local antigen-specific
   proliferative responses in the mesenteric lymph node and primed an
   identical pattern of systemic cytokine responses in the spleen. The
   ability of ISCOMS to prime both Th1 and Th2 CD4(+) T cell responses may

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of an Al-SiC composite system are modelled

   remain perfectly elastic. Several types of reinforcement are modelled;
   at various volume fractions, and with different degrees of clustering.
   The effects of thermal residual stresses, resulting from thermal
   processing, are also modelled. It is found that, even at relatively low
   volume fractions, the shape and orientation of the reinforcement phase
   has significant effects, both in the elastic and plastic domains.
   Orientation of the reinforcement is particularly critical if the aspect
   ratio of the reinforcement is high. The stress field within the

Abstract = {{The vertical distribution of the hyporheos in the Acheron River,
   Victoria, was examined in each of four seasons using a freeze-coring
   technique. Cores were 30 cm long and were split into 10 cm sections.
   Most individuals (>77 \%) and species (>64 \%) occurred in the surface
   (0-10 cm) layer except during winter (July) and once in spring (October)
   when approximately 50 \% of both individuals and species occurred below
   10 cm. Chironomidae, other Diptera, Elmidae, Hydracarina and
   Harpacticoida were the groups that commonly moved down into the bed
   sediments, whereas Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera remained
   largely on the surface in all seasons. Downward migration seemed to be a
   response to increased discharge during the winter and spring; such a
   hydrological pattern is typical for rivers in this region. The degree to
   which the hyporheos can supply colonists after a flood is thus dependent
   on season: far more potential recruits are available in winter than in
   summer.}},

Abstract = {{As genetic testing is an area with implications extending far beyond
   that of the primary patient, it is appropriately an area that is under

   made by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), the College of
   American Pathologists (CAP), the US Health Care Financing Administration
   (HCFA), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as they relate to
   genetic testing. Some of the standards are based on voluntary
   compliance, whereas others have the force of regulation. They all
   address issues of personnel credentials, laboratory operations, and the
   most critical quality assurance and control measures for diagnostic
   laboratories from the perspective of various agencies. In most
   instances, the standards promulgated by these agencies are offered as
   minimum criteria. The exact impact of these regulations on the practice
   of medical genetics has yet to be established.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive series of experimental investigations has shown that both
   inherited and induced autoimmune diseases in laboratory animals may be
   transferred and, conversely, cured by stem cell transplantation. In man,
   the evidence is mainly anecdotal, originating both from the transmission
   of autoimmune conditions following allogeneic BMT from carrier donors to
   non-autoimmune recipients transplant-requiring diseases, and from the
   resolution of autoimmune diseases (mainly rheumatoid arthritis) of the
   recipients after allogeneic BMT from healthy donors. Will it be possible
   to cure severe autoimmune diseases with powerfully immunosuppressive
   conditioning regimens followed by the administration of hematopoietic
   stem cells? If the reconstitution of a naive immune system is necessary,
   allogeneic stem cells will be necessary, but the procedure is still
   saddled with its attending problems, with TRM in the foreground. When
   utilizing autologous stem cells in conjunction with TCD the patients'
   tolerance will be significantly better, but remissions are to be
   anticipated rather than cures. However, some special manipulations may
   be expected to ameliorate results in those selected autoimmune patients
   not or badly responding to conventional immunosuppressive therapy, for
   whom this type of treatment can be offered.}},

Abstract = {{An electrostatic ion guide (EIG) that consists of concentric cylinder
   and central wire electrodes can transport ions efficiently from an
   external ion source to an ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) ion trap for
   mass analysis, with several advantages over current injection methods.
   Because the electrostatic force of the EIG captures ions in a stable
   orbit about the wire electrode, ions with initially divergent
   trajectories may be redirected toward the ICR ion trap for improved ion
   transmission efficiency. SIMION trajectory calculations (ion kinetic
   energy, 1-200 eV; elevation angle, 0-30 degrees; azimuthal angle, 0-360
   degrees) predict that ions of m/z 1000 may be transmitted through a
   strong (0.01 --> 3.0-T) magnetic field gradient. Judicious choice of ion
   source position and EIG potential minimizes the spread in ion axial
   kinetic energy at the ICR ion trap. Advantages of the EIG include large
   acceptance angle, even for ions that have large initial kinetic energy
   and large radial displacement with respect to the central z-axis, low
   ion extraction voltage (5-20 V), and efficient trapping because ions
   need not be accelerated to high velocity to pass through the magnetic
   field gradient.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of large amplitude vortices are numerically investigated
   using a set of two-layer primitive equations. Numerical experiments are
   systematically conducted for the f and beta planes, quasigeostrophic
   (small amplitude) and frontal-geostrophic (large amplitude) dynamics,
   cyclone and anticyclone, and vortex sizes comparable to the radius of
   deformation and larger. In particular, the evolution and migration of
   frontal-geostrophic vortices are discussed with reference to the
   evolution equations in a two-layer ocean. It is shown that the
   anticyclonic vortex with large amplitude displacement evolves
   differently from the quasigeostrophic vortex and that it is extremely
   long-lived.
   The evolution of anticyclonic vortices, in which interfacial
   displacement is large and the size is greater than the radius of
   deformation, is different from that of cyclonic vortices. While the
   shapes of anticyclonic vortices change from circle to ellipse because of
   instability, the large amplitude effect of interfacial displacement
   restores the vortices' shape and causes them to vacillate based on me
   conservation of potential vorticity and angular momentum. On the other
   hand, while the shapes of cyclonic vortices change from circle to
   ellipse, the effect makes their shape more slenderly elliptical. The
   splitting phenomenon of anticyclonic vortices is also different from
   that with cyclonic vortices. The anticyclonic vortices are robust in
   their cores, although they divide their marginal part into several
   vortices: The cores of cyclonic vortices stretch slenderly and split
   several into vortices whose size is the radius of deformation. The
   structure of potential vorticity causes this different behavior between
   cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices due to the large amplitude of
   interfacial displacement in the vortices.
   An upper-ocean vortex generates a tripolar vortex in the lower ocean
   through baroclinic instability while changing its shape from circular to
   elliptical on the f plane. Generating a tripolar vortex in the lower
   ocean, the upper-ocean vortex, moreover, releases the available
   potential energy to the lower ocean as Rossby waves on the beta plane.
   The generated vortex in the lower ocean affects the migration of the
   upper-ocean vortex due to the dispersion of Rossby waves and nonlinear
   modal coupling. These results show that the two-layer vortex with large
   amplitude evolves differently from the reduced-gravity vortex. Finally,
   some arguments are presented to explain the observation of splitting
   cyclonic eddies and the robustness of large anticyclonic eddies.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their structure, phytic acid and its degradation products are
   able to bind other feedstuff ingredients, such as proteins, starch,

   phosphorylation. In order to investigate the influence of industrial
   processing on the inositol phosphate composition of rapeseed, 17
   rapeseed samples and 8 rapeseed meal samples were analysed by an HPLC
   method. Only a small grade of degradation of IP6 was noticed both in
   rapeseed meal, where also IP4 could be determined, and in rapeseed. The
   results were compared with two other phytic acid determination methods.
   The precipitation method with FeCl3 of Wheeler and Ferrel and a
   photometric method were used for this comparison, both methods for
   determination of the sum of inositol phosphates. The results of the HPLC
   method and the method of Wheeler and Ferrel correspond in most cases,

   Design: Chart review.
   Setting: Registry of Ophthalmic Pathology of the AFIP.
   Numbers: Forty-five patients with intraepithelial neoplastic lesions of

   Main outcome measures: Extent; papillomatous pattern; degree of
   parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis and atypia; and amount of solar elastosis.
   Results: Based on their histologic appearance, 24 cases were classified
   as actinic keratosis and 21 cases as dysplasia, Clinically, lesions
   classified as actinic keratosis tended to be focal and leukoplakic,
   whereas those classified as dysplasia tended to be diffuse and
   gelatinous. Two of the lesions classified as actinic keratosis recurred,
   compared with 13 of the lesions classified as dysplasia. In one patient

   The need for adjustment and the adjustment method differed among
   replicates of the MAD conducted on adjacent blocks of land. The RE from
   replicated MAD tests indicated the effectiveness of the MAD for reducing
   the variability in the tests of Fg material. Correlations of the ranks
   of test lines in different replicates of MAD indicated that more of the
   same lines in each replicate would be designated as superior with
   adjustment for heterogenity. The lack of significant positive rank

   This paper examines the history of the NAAQS Exposure Model (NEM) and

   Trends in how the following substantive issues were addressed in the NEM

   microenvironmental (mu e) concentration estimation; and (3) human
   activity and breathing rate simulation.
   In response to an outside peer review of its recent exposure
   assessments, ASB is deemphasizing modeling the entire population in
   favor of limited modeling of narrowly defined `'sensitive groups.'' In
   addition, ASB increasingly is focusing its exposure assessments on those
   human activities that lead to high intake dose, or high intake dose
   rate. Examples are provided that highlight these changes in emphasis.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Since 1981, we have performed 68 thoracoscopic procedures in
   62 patients aged 7 months to 21 years.
   Methods. We reviewed the anesthetic and ventilation strategy used for
   each procedure to determine which anesthetic strategies are safe and
   effective for particular children and conditions.
   Results. Regional anesthesia with sedation was used for six procedures
   in 5 patients with a mean age of 16 years (range, 9 to 21 years). One
   patient required conversion to general anesthesia. General anesthesia
   with one-lung ventilation was attempted for 18 procedures in 17 patients
   with a mean age of 12 years (range, 7 months to 18 years). Two patients
   required conversion to two-lung anesthesia secondary to pulmonary
   intolerance. One of these patients and 2 others required thoracotomy.
   General anesthesia with two-lung ventilation was used for 44 procedures
   in 41 patients with a mean age of 9 years (range, 1 to 17 years). There
   were no anesthesia-related difficulties.
   Conclusions. Regional anesthesia should be limited to the older, more
   cooperative patient. General anesthesia with one-lung ventilation is
   useful in adolescents, as they tolerate collapse of one lung well, and
   it is particularly desirable for procedures requiring exposure of the
   mediastinum and for talc pleurodesis. General anesthesia with two-lung
   ventilation can be used in any age group but is generally necessary for
   infants and small children, as they often will not tolerate the collapse
   of one lung, and in the larger child or adolescent with severe pulmonary
   compromise.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To identify characteristic computed tomographic (CT) findings
   in unusual pulmonary lymphoproliferative disorders seen in adults with
   the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency
   syndrome (AIDS).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the CT scans
   and pathologic specimens from nine patients with pulmonary
   lymphoproliferative disorders. CT scans were evaluated for nodules,
   reticulation, areas of ground-glass attenuation, consolidation, and
   bronchial disease. Changes seen in pathologic specimens were classified
   as consistent with classic lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP),
   mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALTOMA), or atypical
   lymphoproliferative disorder (ALD). Immunopathologic results were
   reviewed when available.
   RESULTS: Eight patients had AIDS. Five patients had classic LIP. One
   patient had MALTOMA, and three patients had ALD. Altogether,
   2-4-mm-diameter nodules were the predominant CT finding in eight
   patients; these were peribronchovascular in four patients. The presence
   of interstitial nodules correlated with the pathologic finding of
   nodular disease in seven patients.
   CONCLUSION. Familiarity with these AIDS-related disorders and their CT
   appearance should assist in the differential diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{The Central Queensland University (CQU) Regional Seismic Network is made
   up of an array of six short-period seismometer and two strong motion
   accelerometer stations. The array has an aperture of about 50 km. CQU is
   able to resolve epicentral co-ordinates to about +/-2 kilometres, with a
   sample rate of 100 per second, and an absolute time accuracy of 100
   milliseconds. This resolution is achieved by using triaxial seismometers
   which allow better secondary phase identification of shear, converted
   and depth phases.
   The network covers an area of above average seismic risk in continental
   Australia. The area has been affected in 1918 by one of the largest
   earthquakes ever recorded along the eastern seaboard of Australia. The
   network also monitors a large number of blasts carried out by the coal
   mines and hard rock quarries in the region, and these are being used in
   a long-term study to determine the structure of the Crust and Upper
   Mantle in Central Queensland.
   Techniques for monitoring rockbursts and longwall caving in mines are
   similar to those used for monitoring local earthquakes. CQU has
   successfully used a single triaxial seismometer to record seismic events
   produced by the strata failure and roof falls of a longwall coal mine.
   The case history presented shows that the initial fall under massive
   roof conditions appears to be predicted by a simple trend plot of
   microseismic event magnitude and longwall production rate. Extension of
   this technique to a closely spaced array of both surface and in-seam
   triaxial seismometers is required for a more detailed appraisal to be
   undertaken. Adequate resolution of event location requires a higher
   sample rate (up to 1000 Hz) and more accurate timing (about 1
   millisecond) than for earthquake monitoring. An appropriate
   stratigraphic model is also required, as is the case for earthquake
   location.}},

   inheritance is the principal determinant of TPMT activity, other factors
   (e.g. renal function, race and thiopurine therapy) have been shown to
   influence erythrocyte TPMT activity, Because the TPMT polymorphism has
   not been established in early erythrocyte populations, and the activity
   of many enzymes differs in neonates, we determined the activity of TPMT
   in erythrocytes obtained from 60 full-term newborns. Median peripheral
   blood TPMT activity was 25.3 U per ml pRBC (range 9 - 52.8 U per ml
   pRBC), which was > 50\% higher than race matched healthy adults (p <
   0.001), Western blot analysis demonstrated higher TPMT protein content
   in erythrocytes from newborns compared to adults, and revealed a
   significant correlation between TPMT protein and TPMT activity in
   erythrocytes (r(s) = 0.63, p = 0.03). Although erythrocyte TPMT activity

   intensities during the shoot growth period compared with stress
   treatments during the root growth period. In addition, the potential
   fecundity of N. gillettei varied among open-pollinated families of
   ponderosa pine in response to feeding on seedlings that were either
   moderately or highly stressed during the shoot growth period. Potential
   fecundity increased in response to larvae feeding on open-pollinated
   families having a low fine root:current-year foliage ratio compared with
   families having a high fine root:current-year foliage ratio. This may
   indicate that differential response for both herbivore and host to water
   stress is caused in part by a genetic component in the host.
   Furthermore, the interactions among timing of stress, level of stress
   and host genotype, shown in this study to influence sawfly performance,
   demonstrate how different combinations of these factors may result in
   opposing conclusions concerning the effects of host plant stress on
   herbivore performance.}},

Abstract = {{This study was performed to examine the hypothesis that an early

   overcome by dose increase. We compared hemodynamic effects of constant
   dose (40 to 120 mg) of oral isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) given every 6
   hours for three doses followed by 12 hours of nitrate washout interval
   with those of escalating dose (40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg) in two similar
   groups of patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Escalating
   ISDN dose resulted in a progressive increase in ISDN blood level and
   overcame early attenuation of effect occurring with a constant dose. At
   peak effect of the third ISDN dose, a significantly greater reduction
   was seen in mean right atrial pressure (-59\% +/- 27\% vs -20\% +/-
   22\%, p < 0.01), mean pulmonary artery pressure (-29\% +/- 11\% vs -11\%

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a stimulated diuresis test
   associated with ultrasound is able to differentiate pelvic dilation due
   to atonicity from pelviureteric junction obstruction (PUO). 42 patients
   (25 f, 17 m) with minimal or moderate renal pelvis dilation revealed by
   sonography were selected for the test. Three different measurements of
   the anteroposterior diameter (APD) of the renal pelvis were done at the
   renal hilus level, by using a transversal ultrasound scan: the first
   under spontaneous diuresis conditions, the second after hydration with
   1.5 liters of water, and the third with a full bladder 15 min after
   intravenous injection of 20 mg frusemide. All the patients underwent
   pyelography. Baseline APD (bAPD) linearly correlated with the PAD both
   after hydration and frusemide (r = 0.89 and r = 0.84, respectively). A
   descriptive evaluation of the frequency distribution of the bAPD
   suggested the possibility that the data samples could belong to three
   populations with different underlying pathophysiological conditions.
   Correspondence analysis between bAPD distribution and PUO suggested that
   the best grouping of data was: group 1 (11 patients) bAPD < 13 mm, group
   2 (14 patients) 13 greater than or equal to bAPD less than or equal to
   20 mm, group 3 (17 patients) bAPD > 20 mm (likelihood ratio chi(2)
   46.36; d.f. = 2). Standard intravenous pyelography showed an increase in
   pelvis size compatible with PUO in 2 patients from group 2 and in all
   patients from group 3. At the end of the test, in group 3 APD increased
   by 20.9 +/- 5.6 mm while in group 2 and group 1 the increase, though
   significant, was moderate (respectively, 7.3 +/- 4.6 and 7.3 +/- 4.9 mm)
   and the APD never exceeded 30 mm. In conclusion, the stimulated diuresis
   test is an important tool for sonographic diagnosis of pelvic dilations.
   It may be regarded as a valid alternative for pyelography and other
   urodynamic tests, particularly for children and for patients with a
   suspected obstruction of the upper urinary tract.}},

Abstract = {{Data from the population-based Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental
   Disabilities Study were used in a case-control study to assess the
   association between low birthweight and mental retardation (intelligence
   quotient less than or equal to 70) among 10-year-old children who were
   born in 1975 or 1976. Children with mental retardation were identified
   from existing records at multiple sources and control children were
   selected from public school rosters. Data on birthweight and other
   covariates (sex, birth order, maternal age, maternal race, maternal
   education and gestational age) came from birth certificates. We used
   multiple logistic regression modelling to obtain adjusted odds ratios
   for mental retardation, with normal birthweight children (those weighing
   greater than or equal to 2500 g) as the referent group. For low
   birthweight children as a whole, the odds ratio for mental retardation
   was 2.8 (95\% CI 1.9-4.2). The risk was higher for very low birthweight
   (<1500 g) children than for moderately low birthweight (1500-2499 g)
   children, and higher for severe mental retardation (intelligence
   quotient <50) than for mild mental retardation (intelligence quotient
   50-70). Adding gestational age to the models revealed that normal
   birthweight children who were born preterm also were at increased risk
   of having mental retardation at age 10 years.}},

Abstract = {{Nb-Si and Mo-Si elemental powder mixtures contained within cylindrical
   capsules were subjected to co-axial shock-wave loading at varying
   pressures (2.8-70 GPa). Shock-induced or shock-assisted chemical
   reactions were observed in these powder mixtures along the capsule axis.
   Three concentric regions with the capsules were observed: (1) fully
   reacted (Mach stem region); (2) partially reacted; and (3) unreacted.
   These results confirm the Krueger-Vreeland concept of threshold energy
   for shock-induced chemical reactions. Analysis of partially reacted
   regions enabled the identification of the reaction micromechanisms in
   accordance with the model proposed by Meyers, Yu and Vecchio (Acta
   Metall. Mater., 42 (1994) 715). Asymmetric shock-wave loading
   experiments on the above powder mixtures were also conducted.
   Significant macroscopic plastic deformation (i.e. epsilon congruent to
   0.2-0.5) along with consolidation were achieved by modifying the
   explosive loading configuration. Because of the asymmetric loading,
   regions of shear localization were produced. These regions were also
   characterized by the onset of the chemical reaction resulting from the
   local thermal excursion due to both the frictional dissipation of
   kinetic energy and plastic deformation. The results obtained in this
   investigation confirm the earlier hypothesis that the shock energy
   dissipated by plastic deformation does play an important role in the
   initiation of the chemical reaction. It is proposed that the
   Krueger-Vreeland threshold energy be modified to take into account the
   plastic deformation energy.}},

Abstract = {{The educational development of the Bechuanaland Protectorate has always
   been controlled by the London Missionary Society (LMS). The latter
   however, was not in a strong enough financial position to direct the
   system of education throughout the territory. By 1928 and due to
   pressure from the LMS, the colonial government took over the control and
   direction of education by introducing school committees, systematizing
   the primary school syllabus, regularizing payment and training teachers
   and introducing cattle post schools. Significant though these efforts
   were, the Africans were still dissatisfied with the development of
   education in the country. They sought education that went beyond the
   primary school level. African and denominational initiatives to build
   secondary schools within the country were designed to address this need.
   Perhaps a dark spot in the educational history of the Protectorate is
   marked by the somewhat blatant discrimination exercised by the colonial
   government in the development of European to the detriment of African
   education and the apparent disregard by all educational parties
   concerned to offer anything new for women. Women were regarded as
   inferior to men and no significant efforts were made to enhance their
   status, income and role in decision making bodies.}},

   patients with ulcerative colitis underwent Tc-99(m)-HMPAO leucocyte
   scintigraphy (TLS) less than 5 days before colonoscopy. Histological
   features of mucosal biopsies were compared with total and segmental
   colonic TLS scores. Segmental and total scintigraphy scores correlated
   most strongly with histological grades for acute inflammation (r=0.75,
   p<0.001 and r=0.9, p<0.001, respectively) and chronic inflammatory cell
   infiltration in the lamina propria (r=0.76, p<0.001 and r=0.86, p<0.001,
   respectively). Tc-99(m)-HMPAO leucocyte scintigraphy detected acute
   inflammation in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis with a
   sensitivity of 91\% and negative predictive value of 80\% and localized
   acute inflammation to a particular colonic segment with a sensitivity of
   82\%, specificity of 94\%, accuracy of 88\%, positive predictive value
   of 94\% and negative predictive value of 91\%. Tc-99(m)-HMPAO leucocyte

   preparation of food (appetite stimulation amplified in anorexia) and
   meal organisation (consumption amplified in bulimia). By ritualisation,
   the author refers to the direction of largely instinctive behaviour

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate both the mean time intervals between
   retinal disease and the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy
   (PVR) and the time intervals at which recurrent PVR develops following
   various kinds of vitreoretinal disease and surgery.
   Methods-One hundred and thirty six consecutive cases of PVR that were
   seen and operated on between 1991 and 1994 were evaluated
   retrospectively. Intervals between onset of disease and PVR or recurrent
   PVR were noted. Conditions leading to PVR, surgical procedures, and the
   final anatomical and functional results were evaluated.
   Results-Before PVR was noted for the first time, an average of 1.06
   vitreoretinal surgical procedures were performed (range 0 to 3). A mean
   of 1.99 surgeries were performed to control PVR or to reach an end stage
   where further surgery would have been unreasonable (range 0 to 5). The
   average (median) time interval between the onset of the retinal disease
   and PVR was 2.0 months (range 0.5 to 45 months). The median time
   intervals between surgery and recurrence for the second, third, or
   fourth times was also 2.0 months (range 0.5 to 34 months).
   Conclusions PVR starts earliest at 2 weeks after an event and
   subsequently quietens down within a maximum of 45 months after treatment
   (median 2 months), PVR may recur more than once but the time course of
   the disease is Likely to be the same for each recurrence.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Vesicouterine fistula is rare. We report a vesicouterine
   fistula that was the direct result of a vaginal delivery in a patient
   with a history of lower uterine segment cesarean delivery.
   Case: A woman developed a vesicouterine fistula during vaginal delivery
   after a previous cesarean. An anterior uterine wall defect was noted
   immediately after the delivery. Continuous bladder drainage was
   unsuccessful in managing her fistula, and surgical correction was
   necessary.
   Conclusion: Although rare, a vesicouterine fistula can occur as a
   complication of vaginal delivery in patients with a history of cesarean
   delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Preschoolers' strategic behavior was examined on a task in which they
   must decide whether two arrays are the same. Fifty-six 3- and
   4-year-olds selected doors to open which exposed parts of the arrays.
   Children made moderate use of an appropriate `'vertical-pairs''
   strategy-viewing spatially corresponding parts of the two arrays-and it
   facilitated performance. Telling nonstrategic children to use the
   strategy or executing it for them improved their same-different
   judgments. However, increased spontaneous production of the
   vertical-pairs strategy over trials did not consistently improve
   judgments, which suggests a strategy utilization deficiency. Other
   microgenetic analyses revealed that children tended to use several
   strategies over the trials and that strategy changes often were not
   developmentally progressive or driven by failure of another strategy.
   The discussion addressed production and utilization deficiencies and the

Abstract = {{Changes in cellular energetic and metabolic parameters were analyzed at

   following removal of nerve growth factor (NGF). As approximately 60\% of

   measured metabolic indicators declined over time. However, this decline
   paralleled the overall decrease in cellular viability, suggesting that,
   in individual cells, a compromised metabolic state occurred suddenly and
   very late in the death process. For example, when expressed as a
   function of viable cells, protein and RNA synthesis did not decrease
   until 24 h, Glucose utilization in live cells was never significantly
   reduced relative to control levels; lactate production decreased
   slightly within 4-8 h after NGF removal, but eventually rebounded to
   122\% of control levels by 24 h. ATP levels dropped 27\% in an early
   predeath period, but then returned to near control levels (on a
   per-live-cell basis) once the population actively began to die. The
   ATP/ADP ratio remained at least 84\% of control throughout. UTP/UDP and

Abstract = {{Nonlinear optics is a broad field of research and technology that
   encompasses subject matter in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology,
   and engineering. The diversity of nonlinear optics stems, in part, from
   the need for all-optical and electro-optical devices for applications in
   telecommunications, optical storage, and all-optical computing. In
   addition, many nonlinear optical effects have proved to be versatile
   probes of fundamental issues such as interfacial adsorption, the
   electronic structure of compound semiconductors, and phase transitions
   in liquid crystal films. This article discusses analytical and device
   applications that are based on second-order nonlinear interactions of
   light with matter. Particular attention is given to the exciting
   technique of infrared-visible sum-frequency generation, which
   illustrates the capability of the second-order nonlinear response in
   probing surface and interfacial phenomena. The connection between
   nonlinear optics and optical waveguides is discussed to demonstrate the
   potential of thin semiconductor films for efficient second-harmonic
   generation in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Chlorobornanes (CHBs) were isolated from recent and older sediments as
   well as from rainbow trout muscle in two prairie lakes that were treated
   with toxaphene as a pesticide in the early 1960s. Gored sediments
   representing the years of treatment(1961/1962) contained high
   concentrations of hepta-, octa-, and nonachlorobornanes (Sigma CHBs,
   1602 and 500 ng g(-1)) with a similar gas chromatographic peak pattern
   to technical toxaphene. In contrast, negative ion mass spectrometry
   confirmed that the near-surface sediments contained hexa- and
   heptachlorobornanes at levels not normally observed in environmental
   samples. This suggests that some of the original toxaphene mixture had
   been dechlorinated and was redistributed by porewater diffusion and/or
   sediment focusing. Analyses of fish revealed a toxaphene `'fingerprint''
   similar to that of the dechlorinated material in sediments, suggesting
   that the chemical was both water soluble and bioavailable. Significant
   residual CHBs in surface sediments and in fish indicate that other
   toxaphene-treated lakes should be reexamined.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes ground-based avoidance for horizontal maneuvers
   using a concept of potential as a collision avoidance aircraft
   procedure. First, mathematical formulation is introduced by using
   potential as a way to systematically represent the conditions
   contributing to collision avoidance such as a threat of collision with
   other aircraft and degrees of deviation from the original course.
   The flight course with a lower potential is considered safer. In the
   choice of a specific avoidance course, an avoidance pattern generation
   method by means of potential gradient is shown. The future location of
   the aircraft is sampled at a certain time interval. The shift of the
   sampling point corresponding to the potential gradient at each sampling
   point or the force applied to each sampling point (attractive or
   repulsive) is repeated.
   It was confirmed that by means of this method, avoidance patterns
   without danger of collision can be obtained with only horizontal
   avoidance except for special cases. However, when the sampling points
   are symmetric or when more than three aircraft are involved, the
   procedure is not adequate and some provisions are needed. To this end,
   the sampling point arrangement in the initial stage before the avoidance
   pattern is formed and the three-dimensional avoidance including vertical
   avoidance can be considered.}},

Abstract = {{In order to provide a fuzzy system with learning function, numerous

   more powerful than other methods using neural networks (or descent
   method). On the other hand the destructive method is superior in the
   number of rules and inference error and inferior in learning speed to
   the constructive method. In this paper, we propose a new learning method
   combining the constructive and the destructive methods. The method is
   superior in the number of rules, inference error and learning speed to
   the destructive method. However, it is inferior in learning speed to the
   constructive method. Therefore, in order to improve learning speed of
   the proposed method, simplified learning methods are proposed. Some

Abstract = {{The cDNA for ATP1AL1, the fifth member of the human

   recently cloned (A. V. Griskin, V. E. Sverdlov, M. B. Kostina, and N. N.
   Modyanov. FEES Lett. 349: 144-150, 1994). The encoded protein (ATP1AL1)
   has all the primary structural features common to the catalytic
   alpha-subunit of ion-transporting P-type ATPases and is similar (63-64\%
   identity) to the Na-K-ATPase alpha-subunit isoforms and the gastric
   H-K-ATPase alpha-subunit. In this study, ATP1AL1 was expressed in
   Xenopus laevis oocytes in combination with the beta-subunit of rabbit
   gastric H-K-ATPase. The functional properties of the stable
   alpha/beta-complex were studied by Rb-86(+) uptake and demonstrated that
   ATP1AL1 is a novel human K+-dependent ATPase {[}apparent half-constant
   activation/(K-1/2) for K+ similar to 375 mu M)]. ATP1AL1-mediated inward
   K+ transport was inhibited by ouabain (inhibition constant similar to 13
   mu M) and was found to be inhibited by high concentrations of SCH-28080
   (similar to 70\% at 500 mu M)]. ATP1AL1 expression resulted in the
   alkalinization of the oocytes' cytoplasm and. ouabain-sensitive proton
   extrusion, as measured with pH-sensitive microelectrodes. These data
   argue that ATP1AL1 is the catalytic alpha-subunit of a human nongastric
   P-type ATPase capable of exchanging extracellular potassium for
   intracellular protons.}},

Abstract = {{Seeds from nine kenaf genotypes (Cubano, Everglades 41, Everglades 71,
   GR2563, Guatemala 48, Indian, 178-18RS-10, Tainung \#1, and Tainung \#2)
   were evaluated for oil, fatty acid, phospholipid, and sterol content.
   Oil content ranged from 21.4 to 26.4\% with a mean of 23.7\%. Total
   phospholipids ranged from 3.9 to 10.3\% of the oil, with a mean of
   6.0\%. Mean sterol percent was 0.9 and ranged from 0.6\% of the total
   oil for 178-18RS-10 accession to 1.2\% for Everglades 71. Palmitic
   (20.1\% of the total fatty acids), oleic (29.2\%), and linoleic (45.9\%)
   were the major fatty acids, and palmitoleic (1.6\%), linolenic (0.7\%),
   and stearic (3.5\%) were the minor components. Medium (C-12-C-14) and
   long (C-22-C-24) chain fatty acids were less than 1\%. Sphingomyelin
   (4.42\% of the total phospholipids), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (12.8\%),
   phosphatidyl choline (21.9\%), phosphatidyl serine (2.9\%), phosphatidyl
   inositol (2.7\%), lysophosphatidyl choline (5.3\%), phosphatidyl
   glycerol (8.9\%), phosphatidic acid (4.9\%), and cardiolipin (3.6\%)
   were identified in the nine genotypes. Phosphatidyl choline,
   phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and phosphatidyl glycerol were the dominant
   phospholipids. In addition, eight unidentified phospholipids were also
   found. beta-sitosterol (72.3\% of the total sterols), campsterol
   (9.9\%), and stigmasterol (6.07\%) were prevalent among kenaf genotypes.
   Kenaf's relatively high oil content and its similarity to cottonseed oil
   suggest that the seed oil may be used as a source of edible oil. The
   variation among genotypes indicates potential for genetic improvement in
   oil yield and quality.}},

Abstract = {{New attenuation equations for peak ground acceleration and velocity for
   Japan are developed. The equations are derived using extensive data
   recorded by the new JMA-87-type accelerometers, which do not require
   instrumental corrections that the older SMAC-type accelerometers do.
   Earthquakes with depths up to 200 km are used to make the equation
   applicable to subduction zone regions, which are common in Japan.
   Effects of depth and local site on the attenuation are considered
   simultaneously with the distance dependence and magnitude dependence
   using a two-stage regression procedure to separate the magnitude
   dependence from the distance dependence. Since the resulting normal
   equations become singular, an iterative partial regression algorithm is
   proposed. It is found that for the same magnitude and distance, peak
   ground motion increases as depth increases. The variation of the station
   coefficients with respect to the corresponding soil-type classification
   is quite wide. The station coefficients for the peak ground acceleration
   are found to be weakly correlated with the general soil classification,
   while a stronger correlation was found for the peak ground velocity. The
   resulting attenuation relations are given by
   log(10) PGA = 0.206 + 0.477 M(J) - log(10) r - 0.00144r + 0.00311h +

   c(i)(v),
   where PGA (cm/sec(2)) and PGV (cm/sec) are the larger of the peak
   accelerations and velocities from two horizontal components, M(J) is the
   JMA magnitude, r is the closest distance to the fault rupture, h is the
   depth, and c(i) is the station coefficient of the recording station. The

   interference fringes.
   Results. The X-ray phase shift caused by blood was 3\% larger than that

Abstract = {{A curious structural change observed in the American semiconductor
   industry (the appearance of a class of `'fabless'' firms) is examined
   within a general transaction costs framework. The framework is refined
   for empirical application with the introduction of the construct
   `'unstructured technical dialog.'' The necessary level of this form of
   interpersonal communication between engineers in the design and
   fabrication stages of production is hypothesized to be positively
   related to the efficiency of a vertically integrated structure in which
   both stages are organized under a single hierarchy. `'Fablessness''
   (i.e., the organizational separation of the design and fabrication
   stages) is argued to be efficient for only these firms whose particular
   product portfolios have only a minimal requirement for such unstructured
   technical dialog. The hypothesis is tested upon a set of relatively
   young semiconductor firms. Support is found for the theoretically
   derived relationship even after controlling for rival explanations found
   in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The Middle Muschelkalk (Middle Triassic) of the Catalan Coastal Range
   (north-east Spain) comprises sandstone, mudstone, anhydrite and minor
   carbonate layers. Interbedded sandstones and mudstones which are
   dominant in the north-eastern parts of the basin are terminal alluvial
   fan deposits. South-westward in the basin, the rocks become dominated by
   interbedded evaporites and mudstones deposited in sabkha/mudflat
   environments. The diagenetic and pore water evolution patterns of the
   Middle Muschelkalk suggest a strong facies control. During eodiagenesis,
   formation of microdolomite, anhydrite, baryte, magnesite, K-feldspar and
   mixed-layer chlorite/smectite was favoured within and adjacent to the
   sabkha/mudflat facies, whereas calcite, haematite, mixed-layer
   illite/smectite and quartz formed mainly in the alluvial facies. Low
   delta(18)O(SMOW) values for microdolomite (+23.7 to +28.4\%) of and
   K-feldspar overgrowths (+17.3 to +17.7 parts per thousand) suggest
   either low-temperature, isotopic disequilibrium or precipitation from
   low-O-18 porewaters. Low-O-18 waters might have developed, at least in
   part, during low-temperature alteration of volcanic rock fragments.
   During mesodiagenesis, precipitation of quartz overgrowths and coarse
   dolomite occurred in the alluvial sandstones, whereas recrystallization
   of microdolomite was dominant in the sabkha/mudflat facies. The isotopic
   compositions of these mesogenetic phases reflect increasing temperature
   during burial. Upon uplift and erosion, telogenetic calcite and trace
   haematite precipitated in fractures and replaced dolomite. The isotopic
   composition of the calcite (delta(18)O(SMOW) = +21.5 to = +25.6 parts
   per thousand; delta(13)C = -7.7 to -5.6 parts per thousand) and presence

Abstract = {{The interactions between the positively charged protein, lysozyme and
   the negatively charged surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in water
   have been investigated by determining the phase equilibria of the
   ternary system within the concentration range of 20 wt \% protein and 20
   wt \% surfactant. Addition of small amounts of SDS to an aqueous
   lysozyme solution results in a precipitation, at protein concentrations
   higher than 0.1 wt \%. The formation of this precipitate is due to
   charge neutralization of the protein (eight positive charges per protein
   molecule) by the surfactant. The tie lines converge toward relative
   concentrations corresponding to charge neutralization and the maximum
   amount of precipitation occurs where the charge neutralization is
   complete. On addition of more SDS, a complete redissolution of the
   precipitate occurs at about 19 SDS molecules per protein, which
   corresponds to the total number of positive sites along the protein
   chain. Between 7 and 20 wt \% of protein, there is a narrow strip
   between the isotropic solution phase and the precipitation region, where
   a bluish-colored, transparent, viscous gel is formed. The molar ratio
   between SDS and lysozyme within the stability region of the gel phase is
   not more than the total number of positive sites of the protein
   molecule. The shape of the tie lines indicates an associative-type of
   interaction between the lysozyme and SDS. The phase diagram is discussed
   in terms of electrostatic and hydrophobic effects.}},

   1989 and October 1994 is reviewed. Of these 42 cases 39 underwent
   surgical excision of the lesion. The surgical group had no mortality,
   2.5\% morbidity and 100\% angiographic cure. Surgery in non-eloquent
   brain (n=21) resulted in no neurological morbidity and surgery in
   eloquent brain (n=18) resulted in a 5.5\% neurological morbidity. The
   reason for not operating in three cases was elderly age in one, poor
   neurological condition in one, and involvement of the posterior limb of
   the internal capsule in one.
   Arteriovenous malformations with diameters no greater than 3 cm are
   considered by some to be suitable for treatment by focussed irradiation,

   of treatment for the majority of cases when factoring in the expected

   observed in the presence of either oxidized glutathione or reduced
   glutathione alone, a response characteristic of the previously described
   auxin-stimulated NADH oxidase activity of soybean plasma membranes.
   Taken together, the results suggest the operation in the plant plasma
   membrane of a protein disulfide-thiol-interchange activity that is
   stimulated by auxins. The auxin stimulations of the interchange activity
   are prevented by glutathione, reduced glutathione, and brefeldin A at
   concentrations that also prevent auxin stimulation of NADH oxidation by
   isolated plasma membranes and inhibit, as well, the auxin-stimulated
   elongation of excised segments of soybean hypocotyls.}},

Abstract = {{The steady reaction rate in a bed of spherical catalyst particles
   immersed in a flowing Newtonian fluid is studied. The dependence of the
   rate on the particle volume fraction phi = 4/3 pi n a(3), where n is the
   number density of spheres and a is the sphere radius, and the Peclet
   number Pe of the uniform bulk flow through the bed is determined
   analytically for phi much less than 1 and Pe much less than 1. The
   Peclet number is the ratio of transport by advection to diffusion; Pe =
   Ua/D, where U is the bulk velocity through the bed and D is the
   molecular diffusivity of the reactant in the fluid. In the absence of a
   bulk flow, it is shown that a bulk reaction in the bed results in a
   screening of the concentration disturbance beyond a distance of O(a
   phi(-1/2)) from a particle. In this case, the nondimensional bulk
   reaction rate or Nusselt number is Nu similar to 1 + (3 phi)(1/2). For
   an isolated particle, it is well-known that weak uniform advection
   balances diffusion at a length scale of O(aPe(-1)) and Nu similar to 1 +
   Pe/2. When there is weak flow through a bed of catalytic particles, the
   influence of flow strength and particle fraction upon the reaction rate
   depends on the ratio of the two length scales, Pe/phi(1/2),
   characteristic of these two limiting situations. For Pe/phi(1/2) = O(1),
   there is a balance of advection, diffusion, and reaction at a distance
   of O(a phi(1/2)) from a particle. The first correction to Nu for all
   Pe/phi(1/2) is shown to be (3 phi + Pe(2)/4)(1/2), in which the
   dependence of Nu on Pe and phi is not, in general, separable, although
   it becomes separable in the limits Pe/phi(1/2) --> 0 and Pe/phi(1/2) -->
   infinity. We also discuss the case of Pe much greater than 1, in which
   Nu has the form of A(phi)Pe(1/3),where A(phi) is an unknown function
   which is apparently O(1) for all phi.}},

   differentiation, The use of inbred mouse strains that develop leukemia
   has greatly facilitated the identification of genes that contribute to
   the neoplastic transformation of hematopoietic cells, BXH-2 mice develop
   myeloid leukemia as a result of the expression of an ecotropic murine
   leukemia virus that acts as an insertional mutagen to alter the
   expression of cellular proto-oncogenes. We report the isolation of a new
   locus, Meis1, that serves as a site of viral integration in 15\% of the
   tumors arising in BXH-2 mice, Meis1 was mapped to a distinct location on
   proximal mouse chromosome 11, suggesting that it represents a novel
   locus, Analysis of somatic cell hybrids segregating human chromosomes
   allowed localization of MEIS1 to human chromosome 2p23-p12, in a region
   known to contain translocations found in human leukemias, Northern (RNA)
   blot analysis demonstrated that a Meis1 probe detected a 3,8-kb mRNA
   present in all BXH-2 tumors, whereas tumors containing integrations at
   the Meis1 locus expressed an additional truncated transcript, A Meis1
   cDNA clone that encoded a novel member of the homeobox gene family was
   identified, The homeodomain of Meis1 is most closely related to those of
   the PBX/exd family of homeobox protein-encoding genes, suggesting that
   Meis1 functions in a similar fashion by cooperative binding to a
   distinct subset of HOX proteins, Collectively, these results indicate
   that altered expression of the homeobox gene Meis1 may be one of the
   events that lead to tumor formation in BXH-2 mice.}},

Abstract = {{A set of models for homogeneous, isotropic turbulence is considered in
   which the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluid flow are
   generalized to a set of N coupled equations in N velocity fields. It is
   argued that in order to be useful these models must embody a new group
   of symmetries, and a general formalism is laid out for their
   construction. The work is motivated by similar techniques that have had
   extraordinary success in improving the theoretical understanding of
   equilibrium phase transitions in condensed matter systems. We consider
   two classes of models: a simpler class (model I), which does not contain
   an exact Galilean symmetry, and a more complicated, extended class
   (model II), which does. The key result is that these models simplify
   when N is large. The so-called spherical limit N-->infinity can be
   solved exactly, yielding closed sets of nonlinear integral equations for
   the response and correlation functions. For model I, these equations,
   known as Kraichnan's direct interaction approximation equations, are
   solved fully in the scale-invariant turbulent regime. For model II,
   these equations are more complicated and their full solution is left for
   future work. Implications of these results for real turbulence (N=1) are
   discussed. In particular, it is argued that previously applied
   renormalization group techniques, based on an expansion in the exponent
   gamma that characterizes the driving spectrum, are incorrect and that
   the Kolmogorov exponent zeta has a nontrivial dependence on N, with
   zeta(N-->infinity)=3/2 for both sets of models. This value is close to
   the experimental result zeta similar or equal to 5/3, which must
   therefore result from higher-order corrections in powers of 1/N.
   Prospects for calculating these corrections are briefly discussed:
   though daunting, such calculations might provide a controlled
   perturbation expansion for the Kolmogorov, and other, exponents. Our
   techniques may also be applied to other nonequilibrium dynamical
   problems, such as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for interface growth,
   and perhaps to turbulence in nonlinear wave systems.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of measurements obtained from high-performance liquid
   chromatography using electrochemical detection is often obscured by both
   the low-frequency drifting background noise and the high-frequency
   background noise. While the quality of measurements can be greatly
   improved by digital filtering techniques which are capable of minimizing
   high-frequency noise, these techniques are very limited in handling
   low-frequency drifting background noise. A method for effectively
   performing background correction (the moving band method) has been
   developed and applied to a few chemical systems which were studied in
   our laboratory. The method examines each sweep (chromatograms or
   voltammogram) for the presence of the analyte peak. Once the peak has
   been detected, the base of the peak is then generated by interpolation
   and then refined visually by adjusting the base peak width. The
   generated base, along with the data points which do not contain the
   peaks, constitutes the background of that sweep. This background is then
   subtracted from the original sweep, leaving the analyte signal on a flat
   baseline. Before the method is applied to a sweep, high-frequency noise
   is removed by fast Fourier transforms digital filtering. The moving band
   method is tested and evaluated using data matrices of nitrophenols and
   catecholamines at concentrations of about 5.0 ng/10 mu L where the
   drifting background noise is significant. The quality of the data
   matrices is greatly improved due to the improved signal-to-noise ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. This study sought to assess the independent contribution of
   nonfatal reinfarction to the risk of subsequent death in patients with
   acute myocardial infarction undergoing thrombolytic therapy.
   Background. A composite of `'unsatisfactory outcomes'' as an end point
   has increased statistical power and facilitated evaluation of evolving
   treatment regimens in acute myocardial infarction, The significance of
   nonfatal reinfarction as a component of a composite end point has not
   been evaluated in the thrombolytic era.
   Methods. Event rate of nonfatal reinfarction over 3-year follow-up was
   evaluated in patients with acute myocardial infarction entered into the
   Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Phase II trial, The independent
   risk of nonfatal reinfarction for subsequent death within various time
   intervals of follow-up was determined. The mortality rate after nonfatal
   reinfarction was compared with that of a matched control group.
   Results. During 3 year follow up, 349 of 3,339 patients had a nonfatal
   reinfarction, Univariate predictors were history (antedating the index
   event) of angina (p = 0.01), hypertension (p = 0.01), multivessel
   disease (p = 0.007) and not a current smoker (p = 0.003); the latter was
   an independent predictor (relative risk {[}RR] 1.3, 99\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] 1.0 to 1.8), Forty-three of the 349 patients with a
   nonfatal reinfarction died: RR for death (VS, patients without a
   nonfatal reinfarction) was 1.9 (99\% CI 1.1 to 3.2) if reinfarction
   occurred within 42 days of study entry, 6.2 (99\% CI 3.0 to 12.9) if
   reinfarction occurred between 43 and 365 days and 2.9 (99\% CI 0.6 to
   13.4) if reinfarction occurred between 366 days and 3 years, The
   cumulative 3-year death rate was 14.1\% in patients,vith a nonfatal
   reinfarction compared with 7.9\% (p < 0.01) in a matched control group,
   Univariate predictors of death after nonfatal reinfarction were age
   greater than or equal to 65 years (p < 0.001), not low risk category (p
   = 0.015) and history of heart failure before the index event (p <
   0.001), Age greater than or equal to 65 years was the only independent
   predictor (RR 5.4, 99\% CI 2.3 to 12.4).
   Conclusions. Nonfatal reinfarction is a strong and independent predictor
   for subsequent death, It represents a powerful component for a composite
   end point in patients who received thrombolytic therapy after acute
   myocardial infarction.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic
   value of changes in left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive
   patients with time.
   Design: Two hundred and fifteen uncomplicated hypertensive patients
   underwent a high-quality baseline echocardiogram for left ventricular
   anatomy evaluation and in 151 of those patients the echocardiographic
   examination was repeated 10 +/- 1.4 years after the initial study.
   Methods: Left ventricular mass index changes were evaluated, in relation
   to the incidence of non-fatal cardiovascular events, adjusted for
   traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
   Results: According to the presence or absence of left ventricular
   hypertrophy (left ventricular mass index > 134 g/m(2) in men and > 110
   g/m(2) in women) at baseline and at the end of follow-up study, patients
   were divided into four groups: with normal left ventricular mass at both
   examinations (n = 78), with regression of left ventricular hypertrophy
   (n = 32), with persistence of left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 34) and
   with hypertrophy development (n = 7). After adjustment for traditional
   cardiovascular risk factors, the cumulative incidence of non-fatal
   cardiovascular events was significantly higher in the group of patients
   without regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Cox survival
   analysis showed the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the end
   of follow-up study to be the most important factor related to
   cardiovascular events.
   Conclusions: The present findings strongly indicate that the lack of
   decrease or the increase of left ventricular mass after antihypertensive
   treatment can be associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular
   events, which is significantly reduced and almost normalized by complete
   regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.}},

Abstract = {{Peas were grown in the glasshouse for 29 d in duplicate Im tall
   containers packed with soil at field capacity (a matric potential of
   -0.005 MPa) to a bulk density of 1.30 Mg m(-3) and with an initial
   penetration resistance (PR) of 0.35 MPa. Counts of new root contacts on
   the sides of the containers and matric potential (psi(m)) measurements
   at 0.1 m depth increments were made every two days. Although the plants
   were not watered, matric potential was never less than -0.041 MPa and
   was unlikely to have directly limited root growth, but it was used as a
   predictor of PR and hence of the effect of PR on root growth rate. The
   effect of PR on root growth was predicted using experimentally
   determined relationships between root growth rate and PR, and PR and
   psi(m). These results were used with the ROOTMAP root growth model to
   give two different model scenarios: (1) variable resistance (VR),
   allowing mechanical impedance to vary with time and depth in line with
   the observed values of psi(m) and (2) constant resistance (CR),
   maintaining mechanical impedance at its value at the start of the
   experiment. CR predictions gave a gross overestimate of the rate at
   which new root contacts were made on the container walls, whereas VR
   predictions agreed with experimental observations to within the limits
   of accuracy of the model and the observations. The comparison between CR
   and VR predictions gives a clear demonstration of how the increase in
   soil strength caused by roots drying the profile can result in a
   reduction in the size and extent of the whole root system.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration of adenosine S-triphosphate (ATP) in endolymph (EL),
   perilymph (PL) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), collected from
   anesthetized guinea pigs was determined using the luciferase-luciferin
   reaction. The cochlea was exposed by a ventrolateral approach and the
   bone overlying scala media of the third turn (EL) or scala vestibuli of
   the first turn (PL) was shaved to a thin layer and a small fenestrum
   made. For EL sampling, a double-barrelled pipette was inserted through
   the spiral ligament-stria vascularis complex. One barrel was filled with
   150 mM KCl to record the endocochlear potential (EP) and upon the
   appearance of the positive EP, 0.12-1.22 mu l of fluid was aspirated
   into the other barrel by gentle negative pressure. For PL sampling, a
   single-barrelled pipette was advanced into scala vestibuli and 0.3-1.6
   mu l of fluid was collected by capillarity. CSF (0.36-1.75 mu l) was
   obtained from the cisterna magna. The cochleae were removed and
   processed for light microscopy to determine the extent of tissue damage
   from the sampling procedure. ATP concentrations (mean +/- SEM, nM) for
   EL, PL and CSF were 12.95 +/- 2.4 (n = 10), 10.5 +/- 3.9 (n = 11) and
   16.1 +/- 5.4 (n = 11) respectively. Differences in ATP concentrations
   among fluids were not statistically significant. To test the effect of
   hypoxia on ATP levels, a group of guinea pigs was subjected to a 90 s
   period of respiratory anoxia prior to sampling of EL, PL or CSF. ATP
   concentrations were 14.4 +/- 3.5 (n = 11), 20.7 +/- 4.1 (n = 10) and
   13.5 +/- 4.6 (n = 4) for EL, PL and CSF, respectively; only PL ATP
   concentrations were statistically different (P = 0.018, Wilcoxon rank
   sum test) to basal conditions. This is the first study which
   demonstrates the presence of free ATP in cochlear fluids. The results
   indicate that ATP is present in cochlear fluids at concentrations close
   to those known to cause hair cell depolarization in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of stem cell factor (SCF) on the growth of
   blast clonogenic cells from 27 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia
   (AML) and 3 patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia in myeloid crisis.
   SCF alone showed a significant stimulatory activity in 15 of 30 patients
   (50\%). A marked reduction in the number of blast cell colonies
   supported by SCF alone was noted by the addition of neutralizing
   antibody (Ab) against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
   (GM-CSF). Ab against interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) also moderately reduced the number of colonies,
   whereas Ab against granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) failed to do so. All four Ab
   together completely abolished the growth in 5 of 6 patients tested.
   c-kit antisense oligonucleotides reduced the colony formation supported
   by IL-3 or G-CSF or, in the absence of growth factor, in only 2 of 10
   patients tested. SCF caused stimulation by acting synergistically with
   G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-6, IL-9, IL-11, and IL-12 in 20 of 27 (74\%), 17
   of 27 (63\%), 14 of 28 (50\%), 9 of 28 (32\%), 1 of 15 (7\%), 3 of 28
   (11\%), and 2 of 15 (13\%) patients, respectively. Thus, SCF alone or in
   combination with some other factor stimulated the growth in 27 of 30
   (90\%) patients. Of 3 nonresponders, 2 were AML, M3 at presentation.
   G-CSF at the optimal concentration increased the sensitivity of blasts
   to SCF. Taken together, SCF acting in combination with other factors,
   but not alone, stimulates the growth of blast clonogenic cells. GM-CSF,
   IL-6, and TNF-alpha may be produced endogenously, whereas G-CSF and SCF
   may be supplied exogenously. Autocrine regulation of the growth of
   blasts seems to increase the responsiveness of the cells to any of these
   factors, allowing them to achieve a highly active growth state.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the usefulness of aspiration sclerotherapy in the
   treatment of hydroceles in the tropics.
   Patients and methods This prospective study included 82 patients with 94
   primary vaginal hydroceles of which 62 hydroceles were treated by
   aspiration and tetracycline hydrochloride sclerotherapy as an
   out-patient procedure (mean age of patients 56.5 years, range 40-82) and
   28 were treated surgically and included as controls (mean age 52.4
   years, range 40-70). All patients were followed for a year.
   Results In the sclerotherapy group, the overall cure rate after a year
   was 95\%, Few complications were encountered in this group: six patients
   (10\%) experienced pain during the procedure, seven patients (12\%) had
   local infection and three patients (5\%) developed haematoma. No
   recurrence was encountered in the surgical group, seven patients (25\%)
   had infection and two patients (7\%) developed haematoma. The mean
   hospital stay for the surgical group was 3.4 +/- 1.3 days (range 1-7).
   Four patients with thick-walled hydroceles had persistent swelling after
   sclerotherapy, the recurrence of which dissatisfied the patients.
   Conclusions Aspiration sclerotherapy for thin-walled hydroceles proved
   to be a curative, simple, safe and cost-effective out-patient procedure,
   II can be an alternative to surgery in developing countries where
   resources are limited.}},

Abstract = {{Few would seriously suggest an early return to a global system of pegged
   exchange rates or, even less, to such a system with a link to gold.
   However, serious proposals have been advanced for some form of a
   `'rules-based system'' in which major countries would adopt meaningful
   commitments to limit fluctuations in exchange rates among their national
   currencies and agree to adjust their macroeconomic policies if needed to
   meet these commitments. In my view, such `'fundamental reform'' of the
   international monetary system is not now feasible and is probably not
   desirable. Rather, what we are likely to see is an increasingly

   peroxide pretreatment, the cell obtained partial resistance to a higher
   level of hydrogen peroxide. The partial resistance to hydrogen peroxide
   in the presence of cycloheximide was acquired within 30 min of
   pretreatment but complete resistance obtained with de novo protein
   synthesis was not attained before 45 min of pretreatment. During
   adaptation to hydrogen peroxide, at least 15 polypeptides are induced,

Abstract = {{The effects of two new immunosuppressors, FK-506 and mizoribine, on
   antigen-induced bronchial inflammation and reactivity to acetylcholine
   in mice were studied in comparison with those of cyclosporin A and
   cyclophosphamide. Three inhalations of an antigen by actively sensitized
   BALB/c mice resulted in an increase in airway reactivity to
   acetylcholine. Twenty-four hours after the final inhalation, the number
   of leukocytes (mononuclear cells and eosinophils) and the amount of
   interleukin 5 (IL-5) increased significantly. In BALB/c nu/nu mice
   (athymic mice), three inhalations of antigen caused no significant
   change in either airway inflammation or hyperresponsiveness. The
   administration of each of the four immunosuppressors clearly inhibited
   antigen-induced airway eosinophilia. Moreover, FK-506, mizoribine and
   cyclophosphamide clearly inhibited the antigen-induced IL-5 production
   and cyclosporin A showed the tendency to inhibit IL-5 production.
   Whereas FK-506, mizoribine and cyclosporin A clearly inhibited the
   antigen-induced airway hyperreactivity in BALB/c mice, cyclophosphamide
   did not show a significant effect on this airway hyperreactivity. These
   results indicate that FK-506, mizoribine and cyclosporin A, but not
   cyclophosphamide, inhibit antigen-induced airway hyperreactivity in
   mice. The mechanism which inhibits antigen-induced airway eosinophilia
   and IL-5 production is not involved in the inhibitory mechanism of
   airway hyperreactivity by FK-506 and mizoribine.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of adenosine or its stable analogues (2-chloroadenosine,
   CADO: 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, NECA; and
   N-6-cyclopentyladenosine, CPA) and a non-selective A(1) and
   A(2)-receptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline (8-PT), or an
   A(1)-receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), on
   the stimulation-evoked release of {[}H-3]norepinephrine ({[}H-3]NE) and
   {[}H-3]acetylcholine ({[}H-3]ACh) from the isolated guinea pig right
   atrium was investigated. Adenosine and its stable analogues (CADO, NECA
   and CPA) inhibited the stimulation-evoked release of {[}H-3]NE in a
   concentration-dependent manner. The order of potencies was CPA > NECA >
   CADO > adenosine. CGS 21680 (30 nM), an A(2a) receptor agonist, failed
   to affect the release. The inhibitory effect of adenosine and CADO on
   {[}H-3]NE release was competitively antagonized by 8-PT. DPCPX also
   prevented the effect of adenosine (K-d = 5.2 nM) and CADO (K-d = 3.3
   nM). The K-d value of 8-PT was 0.40 mu M for the antagonism of CADO and
   0.51 mu M for the antagonism of adenosine. When the negative feedback
   modulation of NE release was inhibited by idazoxan, the inhibitory
   effect of adenosine and CADO on {[}H-3]NE release was more pronounced.
   Under this condition DPCPX (10 nM) prevented the inhibitory effect of
   CADO, indicating that A(1)-purinoceptors are involved in this action.
   The release of {[}H-3]NE is tonically modulated by ACh released from the
   vagal nerve endings, as evidenced by the finding that
   4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), a M(3)-subtype
   selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, and atropine significantly
   enhanced the release of NE. Adenosine, its stable analogues (CADO and
   NECA), and 8-PT did not have any effect on the stimulation-evoked
   release of {[}H-3]ACh. Even when the muscarinic autoinhibition was
   eliminated by atropine, adenosine and CADO did not have any effect on
   {[}H-3]ACh release. Quinpirole, a selective D-2-receptor agonist, and
   neuropeptide Y (NPY) failed to affect the release of ACh. However,
   atropine and 4-DAMP, a selective M(3)-receptor antagonist, significantly
   enhanced the stimulation-evoked release of {[}H-3]ACh. These findings
   indicate that there are no presynaptic heteroceptors (adenosine, D-2,
   and NPY) on the vagal nerve endings of the guinea pig right atrium. It
   is concluded that the sympathetic nerve endings of the guinea pig right
   atrium are equipped with A(1)-, subclass of purinoceptors and
   alpha(2B)-, and muscarinic (M(3))-receptors. Cholinergic vagal nerve
   endings in the heart are only equipped with muscarinic autoreceptors.
   Therefore, adenosine liberated during hypoxia inhibits NE release from
   the cardiac sympathetic nerve and thereby protects against
   tachyarrhythmia caused by myocardial hypoxia. in contrast, adenosine
   does not inhibit the vagal innervation of the right atrium.}},

Abstract = {{The address of the ring local area network (LAN) station must be unique
   in the ring. This paper considers the distributed control-type ring LAN
   with the configuration management function and proposes an MAC layer
   address test protocol, which can avoid the duplication of MAC addresses.
   In the ring LAN, the number of stations contained in the ring is
   increased or decreased by contraction or expansion of the ring.
   The duplication of addresses can occur due to the change of the
   stations, i.e., the set of MAC addresses. Consequently, the proposed
   system executes the duplicated address test being aligned to the ring
   connection of the station or the ring reconfiguration. The station
   executes the duplicated address test by the same protocol for various
   topologies of the ring LAN, such as the single ring, the simple dual
   ring, and the dual ring with the hierarchical star-ring structure. By
   the proposed protocol, it is possible to construct the ring LAN so that
   the stations have an inherent MAC address no matter how the ring may be
   reconfigurated.
   The proposed algorithm is described by the finite-state machine (FSM),
   and a series of processing flows is shown for the address test
   accompanying the ring reconfiguration. The proposed protocol is included
   in the IEEE Recommended Practice for the duplicated address test in the
   dual-ring LAN with the ring reconfiguration function.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of bilateral
   muscular resection on the rotational pattern of the rat mandible. The
   specific aim of the study was to seek possible changes in `'articular
   growth'' in the posterior (ramus and condyle of the mandible), and in
   the anterior part of the face (upper viscerocranium, and maxillary and
   mandibular dentoalveolar processes), The masseter, temporal, and
   suprahyoid muscles were bilaterally resected in three experimental
   groups of 21-day-old female Wistar rats, Another group of rats served as
   control. The results were evaluated at 42 (prepubertal) and 60 days
   after birth (pubertal rats). The craniofacial growth pattern, ramus
   dimension, condylar growth direction, histologic evaluation of condylar
   cartilage, and dentoalveolar processes height changes were studied. Two
   mandibular rotational patterns were found: one inferior after masseter
   muscles resection (MR), and the other superior after temporal muscles
   resection (TR), A less intense superior rotational pattern, after
   suprahyoid muscles resection (SR), was found also, Morphologic changes
   were more intense in older rats. On the contrary, more intense condylar
   histologic changes were found in younger rats, Changes in `'articular
   growth'' primarily take place at maxillary and mandibular dentoalveolar
   processes. Condylar growth amount could be modified to a limited extent.
   More important were the changes in condylar growth direction. An upward
   rotational pattern of the upper viscerocranium was detected when the
   inferior mandibular rotation pattern was produced.}},

   of CBT is unclear. Twenty patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for PD/A
   were treated, by the same therapist, with either group (CBTgr) or
   individual (CBTi) CBT and followed monthly for six months post
   treatment. Both CBTgr and CBTi significantly (and to the same extent)
   reduced panic frequency at treatment end. However, a differential effect
   favouring CBTi over CBTgr was observed with regards symptoms other than
   panic, such as generalized anxiety-like and depressive symptoms. This,
   differential effect favouring CBTi was also observed at the end of the
   follow-up phase, where outcome was measured as the number of patients

Abstract = {{In conjunction with the Lithoprobe southern Canadian Cordillera program,
   an extensive examination of geochemical indicators of origins, movement,
   chemical evolution, and economic significance of paleocrustal fluids was
   conducted. The study area covers approximately 360 000 km(2) from the
   Canadian Rockies to Vancouver Island. Research incorporated
   petrological, mineralogical, fluid-inclusion, epsilon(18)O, delta D,
   delta(13)C, and Rb/Sr studies of samples of quartz +/- carbonate veins
   and other rock types. The results of the study document a variety of
   pre-, syn-, and postorogenic, crustal fluid events. In the Rockies, a
   major pre-Laramide hydrothermal event was identified, which was
   comprised of a west to east migration of warm, saline brines. This was
   followed by a major circulation of meteoric water in the Rockies during
   Laramide uplift. In the southern Omineca extensional zone, convecting
   surface fluids penetrated to the brittle-ductile transition at 350-450
   degrees C and locally into the underlying more ductile rocks. A
   principal conclusion of the study is that most quartz +/- carbonate
   veins in metamorphic rocks in the southern Canadian Cordillera
   precipitated from deeply convected surface fluids. This conclusion
   supports a surface fluid convection model for the genesis of mesothermal
   Au-quartz veins, common in greenschist-facies rocks worldwide. The
   combination of our geochemical results with the results of other
   Lithoprobe studies indicates that widespread and deep convection of
   surface fluids in rocks undergoing active metamorphism is a commonplace
   phenomena in extensional settings, while in compressional-thrust
   settings the depth of penetration of surface fluids is more limited.}},

   9581 Pioneer metabolized 66\% of the absorbed C-14-AC 263,222, compared

Abstract = {{Verlukast (MK-0679) is a potent leukotriene D-4 antagonist that was
   under development for the treatment of bronchial asthma, A previously
   uncharacterized metabolite of verlukast was formed in incubations using
   rat liver cytosol fortified with glutathione (GSH), The metabolite was
   detected by HPLC and characterized by UV spectroscopy (photodiode array
   detection after HPLC) and capillary HPLC continuous flow-liquid
   secondary-ion mass spectrometry, After a large-scale incubation and
   isolation, it was further characterized by 500 MHz proton NMR, The
   metabolite is a 1,4-Michael addition product in which GSH has added to
   position 12 of the styryl quinoline double bond of verlukast. There is
   no apparent stereoselectivity because a mixture of the two possible
   isomers, in equal amounts, was observed by NMR, Although there was
   spontaneous chemical addition of GSH to verlukast (0.18 nmol/min), the
   reaction was shown to be enzyme-catalyzed in studies using three
   different preparations of rat liver cytosol at pH 7.4, Using
   Lineweaver-Burk analysis of experiments in which the effect of vertukast
   concentration on the rate of conjugation was studied, the apparent K-M
   and V-max were determined to be 107 +/- 22 mu M (SD, N = 3) and 0.66 +/-
   0.21 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. In similar studies with GSH as
   the variable substrate, the apparent K-M and V-max were 2.32 +/- 0.68 mM
   and 0.69 +/- 0.14 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively, Incubations with
   kidney cytosol produced the GSH, cysteinylglycine, and cysteine
   conjugates of verlukast, In bile collected from rats dosed intravenously
   with 50 mg/kg of verlukast, similar to 80\% of the dose was recovered up
   to 4 hr postdose. The GSH conjugate accounted for 16.5\% of the dose,
   The cysteinylglycine, cysteine, and N-acetylcysteine conjugates were
   observed and together accounted for 7.5\%, Verlukast accounted for
   14.5\%, and the remainder of the metabolites (40.5\%) were oxidation or
   acyl glucuronide metabolites.}},

   the rate of mass loss M, and the microturbulent velocity component
   zeta(mu), while we assume the temperature for a reference atmospheric
   layer, an assumption that appears not to be critical. An iterative
   solution of the momentum equation, simultaneous with some other
   equations, yields values for the various accelerations acting on a
   stellar atmosphere and their algebraic sum g(eff)', the predicted
   effective acceleration. In the first part of the paper we compare this
   latter quantity with the g(eff)-value derived observationally from
   spectral studies of nine program stars and we find overall fair
   agreement. This supports the method as well as the values of the five
   input data.
   In part 2 we determine g(eff)' in same way for the whole upper part of
   the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram by using statistical primary data on the
   mass (based on evolutionary calculations), on mass-loss and on
   microturbulence (shockstrengths). We find as a fairly general rule that,
   as stars move along their evolutionary track, and for time scales longer
   than the dynamic time scale of the atmosphere, the atmosphere
   continuously adapts to the new (L, T-eff)-values and essentially remains
   stable. Current practice of determining the stability limit of stellar
   atmospheres by extrapolating hydrostatic models to the Eddington limit
   is not justified by this study. There is one exception: we find a small
   area around T-eff = 8300 K and log(L/L.) = 5.7, where no solution is
   possible for evolved stars on their blueward evolutionary track; the
   stars in this area have in any case effective accelerations < 1 mm
   s(-2): the `'Yellow Evolutionary Void''.
   In the third part we estimate approximately the pulsational
   (in-)stability of stars in the upper part of the Hertzsprung-Russell
   diagram, by comparing the g(eff)' values determined in part 2 with the
   average outward pulsational acceleration. We thus confirm the `Yellow
   Evolutionary Void' for blueward evolving stars, and also find an
   instability region for blueward evolving stars in the area occupied by
   the Wolf-Rayet stars. This seems to agree with the observations that the
   low-temperature boundary of the Yellow Evolutionary Void appears to
   coincide with the region where the yellow hypergiants are clustering.
   The yellow hypergiants are therefore interpreted as blueward moving
   stars with ZAMS masses of about 25 - 40M., and actual masses between 15
   and 25 M.. For our galaxy it is found that only a few stars are situated
   within the `Yellow Evolutionary Void', in accordance with our
   expectation.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence rate of gastric cancer among men of Japanese ancestry
   living in Hawaii is about one-third as high as that of their
   counterparts living in Japan. Because of this difference, a prospective
   study was conducted to identify factors related to the development of
   gastric cancer in Hawaii. Eight thousand and six (8,006) men born from
   1900-1919 were examined from 1965 to 1968 and followed for over 25
   years. During this time, 250 incident cases of gastric cancer were
   identified. The study has found the following: 1) prior infection with
   Helicobacter pylori bacteria increased the risk for stomach cancer; 2)
   cigarette smoking was positively associated with gastric cancer with age
   at which smoking started being an important risk factor; 3) after taking
   cigarette smoking into account, alcohol intake was not related to
   stomach cancer risk; 4) a low pepsinogen I level identified subjects at
   increased risk for the intestinal histologic type of gastric cancer; 5)
   a low serum ferritin level was a marker for increased risk of stomach
   cancer; 6) there was a weak indication that the intake of vegetables and
   fruits was inversely related to gastric cancer; 7) there was no
   association of stomach cancer with levels of serum cholesterol, serum
   uric acid, serum micronutrients (retinol, beta-carotene or
   alpha-tocopherol) or blood hematocrit; 8) there was also no association

Abstract = {{The molecular signaling of secondary induction is a fundamental process
   in organogenesis during embryonic development. To study the signal
   transduction pathways involved, we used developing chicken skin as a
   model and focused on the roles of intracellular signaling during feather
   morphogenesis. Protein kinase C (PKC) immunoreactivity increases in the
   whole layer of forming dermis around H and H stage 30. This is followed
   by a gradual and highly localized decrease of PKC expression immediately
   beneath each forming feather germ. In contrast, cAMP response element
   binding protein (CREB) is ubiquitously expressed in both epithelium and
   mesenchyme. From stage 29 on, phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB), reflecting
   the activity of protein kinase A (PKA), begins to be seen in placode but
   not in interplacode epithelia. P-CREB is also expressed in bud
   mesenchyme transiently between stages 33 and 36, but not in the interbud
   mesenchyme. The presence and activity of PKC, PKA, and P-CREB in
   developing chicken skin are further characterized by immunoblot, kinase
   activity, and gel shift assays. To explore their physiological
   significance, embryonic chicken dorsal skin explants were treated with
   different modulators in medium or in beads for localized effects. The
   results showed that PKA activators and PRC inhibitors can expand a
   feather bud domain by enhancing dermal condensation, while PKC
   activators and PKA inhibitors can expand interbud domains. Neural cell
   adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is involved in dermal condensation. We
   observed that activation of PKA causes diffused expression of N-CAM in
   mesenchyme while activation of PKC causes the disappearance of N-CAM in
   precondensed mesenchymal regions. A model of how the well-concerted PKA
   and PKC signaling may be involved in the formation and size regulation
   of dermal condensation is presented. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Title = {{INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHEMICAL-CONSTITUENTS, RUMEN DRY-MATTER AND
   NITROGEN DEGRADABILITY IN FRESH LEAVES OF MULTIPURPOSE TREES}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{This work determined the inter-relationships between chemical
   constituents, rumen dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) degradabilities of
   fresh leaves from 20 multipurpose tree (MPTs) accessions belonging to
   the following genera: Acacia (2), Cajanus (2), Chamaecytisus (2),
   Erythrina (2), Leucaena (8) and Sesbania (4). Significant differences (P
   < 0.05) were observed among genera in all assayed chemical attributes
   except hemicellulose. There was apparently no disappearance of N in A
   saligna after the initial solubility. All genera had similar DM and N
   solubility but varied in degradation rate of DM (0.064-0.137 h(-1); P <
   0.002) and N (0.062-0.135 h(-1); P < 0.001), effective degradability of
   DM (672-856 g kg(-1); P < .001) and effective degradability of N (NED;
   701-902 g kg(-1); P < 0.001). Except for A saligna, synchronization
   indices of the release of nutrients for each accession ranged from
   perfect (0.93) to poor (-0.31) for soluble nutrients and from moderate
   (0.75) to very poor (-0.81) for insoluble slowly degradable nutrients
   because N was in excess. Inter-relationships among chemical
   constituents, DM and N degradation constants were established using
   correlation and regression analyses. Negative correlations occurred
   between N solubility and proanthocyanidins (PAs; P < 0.05), N
   degradation rate and hemicellulose (P<0.05), NED and either NDF (P <
   0.05) or hemicellulose (P < 0.05) or PAs (P < 0.01), while N degradation
   rate was positively correlated with N content (P < 0.01). Equations for
   predicting N degradability characteristics (solubility, insoluble slowly
   degradable fraction, potential and effective degradability, rate of
   degradation and lag phase) accounted for 0.44-0.83 of the variation
   (using chemical constituents), 0.56-0.81 of the variation using
   corresponding DM degradation characteristics and, 0.74-0.89 of the
   variation using mixed criteria. Superior models were of the form: ND\_P
   = DM\_P(-beta), where ND\_P and DM\_P are corresponding N and DM
   degradability characteristics, respectively, and beta the regression of
   the deviations of the ratio ND\_P : DM\_P from unity on chemical
   constituents and accounted for 0.75-0.92 Practical implications of DM
   degradability and nutrient release synchrony indices in relation to
   basal roughage intake and microbial protein synthesis were discussed. It
   was concluded that a mixed model could adequately predict N
   degradability of fresh forages and alleviate analytical cost. A
   functional approach of classifying browses is outlined.}},

Abstract = {{The problems inherent in establishing linkages between financial SHA and
   FFI in Nigeria are immense, though surmountable. To be more effective,
   policy measures concerning these problems have to be reflected in the
   overall rural development goals of the several tiers of the government,
   namely, the local government, the states, and the federal government.
   Given the potentials of rural financial linkages in fostering
   socio-economic development of the rural areas in Nigeria, especially
   where the preponderance of financial SHA has been established, measures
   should be taken to facilitate the promotion of such links. These
   include:
   enactment by government of special SHA. legislation, which will spell
   out in detail the conditions under which such institutions can operate
   integration of viable indigenous SHA by the creation of co-ordinating
   central organisations at the community, local government, and state
   levels. Such organisation will facilitate the free flow of information,
   engender the habit of banking, provide the forum for the much needed
   financial education, and homogenise the operations of SHA.
   commissioning a consultancy team that will define clearly important
   elements in such linkages.
   Nonetheless, given the envisaged initial difficulties in such a linkage,
   it is necessary to start first on a pilot basis, with government
   agencies serving as temporary intermediaries and facilitators.
   Furthermore, such a programme should begin with well established and
   viable SHA. Nigeria could draw from the experiences of Asian countries.
   The future growth and development of rural financial linkages is closely
   linked with the ability of the FFI and SHA to undergo institutional and
   behavioural. changes backed by an efficient and well-managed monitoring
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Previously conducted experiments of fat emulsification in liver sausages
   have shown that liver proteins liberated when chopping raw liver cause
   dispersed fat particles to gel. In addition, eletro-optical experiments
   have led to insights into the formation of a `'granular-filamental''
   network, partly consisting of hydrated and liberated liver protein
   molecules. This network can be conducive in preventing fat droplets from
   recoalescing when cooking sausage, causing a coarse
   `'globular-granular'' network during thermal transition. So far, the
   role played by connective tissue proteins in fine liver sausage meat
   that have been broken down hydrothermically has remained unclear.
   Transmission of electro-optical experiments have shown such connective
   tissue proteins to be involved instabilizing dispersing fat. Subsequent
   experiments into emulsifying effect of gelantinous solutions in
   fat/water model emulsions confirmed the electro-optical findings. In
   principle it is possible to pre-emulsify fat that is thermodynamically
   stable with no more than a gelatinous solution in a colloid mill.
   As a new kind of intermediate product the emulsion thus gained - either
   firm or as a spread - could be of practical importance for the
   production of meat.}},

   great advantage of this technique in contrast to UV/VIS absorption
   spectroscopy results from the fact, that the impact scattering mechanism
   of HREELS makes it possible to also detect optically forbidden
   electronic transitions. On the other hand, the electrons used as probes
   in HREELS have a wavelength which is two orders of magnitudes smaller if
   compared to those of photons used in UV/VIS absorption spectroscopy.
   Therefore individual molecules are excited by HREELS independent from
   each other and hence the excitation of collective excitons is not
   possible. As a result, information about the orientation of the
   molecules cannot be achieved with HREELS, which, however, is possible in
   polarization-dependent UV/VIS spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The mouse KC gene is an alpha-chemokine gene whose transcription is
   induced in mononuclear phagocytes by LPS. DNA sequences necessary for
   transcriptional control of KC by LPS were identified in the region
   flanking the transcription start site. Transient transfection analysis
   in macrophages using deletion mutants of a 1.5-kb sequence placed in
   front of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene identified an
   LPS-responsive region between residues -104 and +30. This region
   contained two kappa B sequence motifs. The first motif (position -70 to
   -59, kappa B1) is highly conserved in all three human GRO genes and in
   the mouse macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) gene. The second
   kappa B motif (position -89 to -78, kappa B2) was conserved only between
   the mouse and the rat KC genes. Consistent with previous reports, the
   highly conserved kappa B site (kappa B1 was essential for LPS
   inducibility. Surprisingly, the distal kappa B Site (kappa B2) was also
   necessary for optimal response; mutation of either kappa B site markedly
   reduced sensitivity to LPS in RAW264.7 cells and to TNF-alpha in NIH 3T3
   fibroblasts. Although both kappa B1 and kappa B2 sequences were able to
   bind members of the Rel homology family, including NF kappa B1 (P50),
   RelA (65), and c-Rel, the kappa B1 site bound these factors with higher
   affinity and functioned more effectively than the kappa B2 site in a
   heterologous promoter. These findings demonstrate that transcriptional
   control of the KC gene requires cooperation between two kappa B sites
   and is thus distinct from that of the three human GRO genes and the
   mouse MIP-2 gene.}},

Abstract = {{We measured pyruvate kinase (PK), citrate synthase (CS), and lactate
   dehydrogenase (LDH) activities in the right and left ventricles of
   fetal, maternal, and nonpregnant adult sheep exposed to high altitude
   (3,820 m) for 112 days and compared them with control groups of animals
   kept at sea level. Enzymes were assayed by the spectrophotometric
   appearance of reaction products specific to each enzyme, and activity
   was expressed as micromoles per minute per gram of wet weight of tissue.
   In control sheep, CS activity was significantly higher in both
   ventricles of the pregnant and nonpregnant adult compared with the
   fetus. However, LDH and PK activities were only higher in the left
   ventricle of the nonpregnant adult compared with the fetus. Long-term
   hypoxemia significantly increased LDH activities in fetal(57 and 53\%),
   pregnant adult (29 and 27\%), and nonpregnant adult (25 and 24\%) right
   and left ventricles, respectively. CS activities also increased in fetal
   (89 and 97\%), pregnant adult (43 and 39\%), and nonpregnant adult (46
   and 48\%) right and left ventricles, respectively. However, PK activity
   was not affected by altitude in any group of animals. In the fetal
   heart, which uses lactate as its primary metabolic fuel, these enzyme
   changes may help enhance aerobic energy production during hypoxemia. In
   the adult heart, which relies on free fatty acids as well as glucose for
   energy production, the significance of these enzyme changes is less
   clear.}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol particles were collected in the spring of 1990 and 1991 and in
   the summer of 1990 at Zhangye and its surrounding areas in northwestern
   China and analyzed with an electron microscope equipped with an
   energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer. The weight percentages of
   elements with atomic numbers larger than 11 (sodium) in individual
   particles were obtained using EDX spectra. Three samples collected in
   spring and one sample in summer were analyzed and particle type
   classifications were given.
   In spring, mineral particles were present in high number fractions
   (97-98 \%) of particles in the radius range of 0.1-6 mu m. Particles
   mainly composed of aluminosilicate comprised 60-70 \% of mineral
   particles. The samples were characterized by the presence of `'Ca-rich''
   particles. The `'Ca-rich'' particles were present in number proportions
   (10-20 \%) of mineral particles and often contained S, suggesting the
   presence of CaSO4 .2H2O (gypsum). However, most of the mineral particles
   had the weight ratios of S/Ca less than 0.1. The analysis showed that
   `'Ca-dominant'' particles, which would be mainly composed of CaCO3
   (calcite), were present mainly in the sub-micrometer radius range.
   In summer, particles were collected under the atmospheric condition of
   strong wind (8 ms(-1)). The sample also showed that mineral particles
   were dominant (98 \% by number) in particles of 0.1-5 mu m radius. This
   result suggests the importance of mineral particles, even in the
   summertime atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{In the preceding study (Okamura et al., 1992; Biol Reprod 47:1040-1052)
   we suggested that a 135-kDa protein secreted by porcine epididymis is
   involved in the sperm maturation. In this work, we have isolated the
   cDNA clone coding the 135-kDa protein in an effort to investigate its
   structure and function.
   The 135-kDa protein was purified from porcine cauda epididymal fluid.
   Three oligonucleotide probes were synthesized according to the amino
   acid sequences of N-termini of the native protein and trypsin-digested
   peptides. A cDNA clone hybridizing with these three probes was isolated
   from the cDNA library derived from the porcine proximal corpus
   epididymis. It encodes a novel protein with 1,006 amino acid residues in
   an open reading frame.
   Its overall amino acid sequence was significantly homologous (25.7\%) to
   the alpha-mannosidase precursor of Dictiostelium discoideum (P34098).
   The 135-kDa protein could digest both p-nitro-phenyl-alpha-D-mannoside
   and high mannose oligo saccharide (Man(8)-GlcNAc(2)), strongly
   suggesting that it is an alpha-mannosidase homologue.
   The expression of this protein was specific to porcine and was localized
   to the very narrow parts of epididymis: the border of the caput and
   corpus epididymis. This protein may serve as a good marker for the
   functional differentiation in porcine epididymis. A possible role of
   this protein in the species-specific sperm-egg interaction is discussed.

Abstract = {{Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is needed for normal catabolism of
   triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In some tissues, notable the adipose
   tissue, the local LPL activity is an important determinant for how much
   lipid is taken up. There is regulation of gene expression, but the rapid
   changes that occur in response to the nutritional state are mediated
   mainly by post-transcriptional mechanisms. In the fed state, the adipose
   tissue expresses its full potential for LPL production, as set by the
   mRNA levels and the rate of protein synthesis. During fasting, LPL
   activity is suppressed by an unknown post-translational mechanism. In
   heart, regulation is primarily exerted on the equilibrium between LPL at
   endothelial sites and LPL in blood, with more endothelial LPL in the
   fasted state. LPL forms complexes with fatty acids which results in
   shut-down of lipolysis and detachment of both lipase and lipoproteins
   from the endothelial site. This provides a molecular coupling device
   between the cellular metabolic state and the rate of lipoprotein
   catabolism. There is growing evidence that LPL is a multifunctional
   protein, which not only affects lipolysis but also acts as a ligand for
   binding of lipoprotein particles such as chylomicron remnants to cell
   surfaces and receptors.}},

Abstract = {{Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to study structural
   characteristics of human serum albumin (HSA) in solution under different
   pH conditions. Guinier analysis of SAXS results yielded values of the
   molecular radius of gyration ranging from 26.7 Angstrom to 34.5 Angstrom
   for pH varying from 2.5 to 7.0. This suggests the existence of
   significant differences in the overall shape of the molecule at
   different pH. Molecular models based on subdomains with different
   spatial configurations were proposed. The distance distribution
   functions associated with these models were calculated and compared with
   those determined from the experimental SAXS intensity functions. The
   conclusion of this SAXS study is that the arrangement of molecular
   subdomains is clearly pH dependent; the molecule adopting more or less
   compact configuration for different pH conditions. The conclusions of
   this systematic study on the modification in molecular shape of HSA as a
   response to pH changes is consistent with those of previous
   investigations performed for particular pH conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined nest-site choice in a migratory population of pied
   flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) and sympatric populations of three
   resident tit species (Parus major, P. caeruleus and P. palustris) in
   central Sweden. All four species are secondary-cavity nesters which
   naturally breed in pre-formed Free cavities but readily use artificial
   nest boxes. We asked whether flycatchers and tits discriminate between
   nest boxes that: 1. Are `empty'; 2. Contain old nests without
   ectoparasites (fleas Ceratophyllus sp.); or 3. Contain old nests with
   ectoparasites. We found that pied flycatchers preferred nest boxes
   containing old nests, regardless of whether these nests held parasites.
   In contrast, ties did nor, discriminate between the three types of
   boxes. Tits may pay a cost for their lack of choosiness: after the
   breeding season, tit nests contained more fleas than flycatcher nests.
   Nevertheless, parasites did not affect the choice of a nest site in any
   of the species studied. We suggest that the migratory flycatchers are in
   a hurry to start breeding upon arrival and use the presence of an old
   nest as a shortcut cue to assess nest-site quality. Also, they may save
   valuable time by copying the choice of previous breeders. Non-migratory
   tits may have more time to inspect nest sites, but do not seem to use
   the same cues in nest-sire selection as the pied flycatcher.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To determine the color Doppler sonographic characteristics and
   clinical relevance of persistent needle tracts after femoral arterial
   puncture.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: After diagnostic (n = 18,825) or interventional
   (n = 8,489) cardiac catheterization, 1,327 color Doppler sonograms of
   the groin were obtained over a 54-month period. Gray-scale images, color
   flow images, pulsed Doppler spectra, and clinical records were
   evaluated.
   RESULTS: Twenty-one cases of linear tracts of pulsatile color flow were
   identified with accompanying Doppler waveform analysis. The mean length
   and width of the tracts were 21.6 mm (range, 6-33 mm) and 2.7 mm (range,
   1-5 mm), respectively. Doppler analysis revealed monophasic flow only in
   systole in seven cases, triphasic flow in seven cases, and monophasic
   flow in systole with continued forward flow during diastole in seven
   cases. No tract required surgical repair.
   CONCLUSION: Color Doppler sonography of the groin after femoral arterial
   catheterization may demonstrate a linear tract of color flow that
   corresponds to the expected path of the needle. These tracts do not seem
   to be clinically important and do not require further color Doppler
   imaging when they represent isolated findings.}},

   included in parallel group (n = 280) or cross-over studies (n = 39) were
   pooled. 24 h ambulatory BP recordings were available after 2- to 4-week
   washout from treatment and at the end of a 4- to 8-week period of
   treatment with calcium antagonists (n = 143), angiotensin converting
   enzyme inhibitors (n = 103) or placebo (73 patients from parallel group
   studies and 39 from a cross-over study). Each recording started between
   0900 and 1000 h, immediately after the drug or placebo intake during the
   treatment phase. BP was measured at 15 min intervals during the day and
   at 15-20 min intervals during the night. Peak changes were calculated
   from systolic BP and diastolic BP 2-8 h after drug intake, and trough
   changes from readings taken during the last 4 h of the 24 h.
   Results: Peak changes induced by drug treatment were progressively
   reduced when data were averaged over 1, 2, 4 and 6 h. BP reproducibility
   showed a concomitant increase and the best compromise between correct
   estimate of peak changes and reproducibility was the average of the
   adjacent 2 h with the maximal BP fall. Peak and trough (average of last
   2 h) changes showed a normal distribution, whereas trough:peak ratios
   showed non-normal distributions, large scatters and many individual
   values with no pharmacodynamic significance (namely, much above unity
   and below zero). Selecting responders to treatment reduced the
   dispersion and made the trough:peak ratio distribution normal. There was
   no correlation between trough:peak ratios and changes in BP variability
   (standard deviation of 24 h mean) induced by treatment. Placebo
   administration caused no trough but a modest peak fall. Peak changes
   during placebo also showed a wide scatter and a non-normal distribution,
   which makes correction with respect to average peak placebo data
   inappropriate in parallel-group studies. However, placebo correction may
   be performed for each subject in cross-over studies, leading to a
   reduction in peak changes and an increase in trough:peak ratio values.
   Conclusions: When the trough:peak ratio is assessed from ambulatory BP,
   peak and trough changes should preferably be computed over a 2 h time
   window. To remove values with no pharmacodynamic significance, the
   analysis should preferably be conducted only in responders to treatment
   at peak. Although placebo is accompanied by some peak effect, placebo
   correction might be appropriate only for individual subjects in
   cross-over studies.}},

Abstract = {{The role of K+ channels and intracellular {[}Ca2+] in flow-induced
   nitric oxide (NO) production was investigated in bovine aortic
   endothelial cells in culture. NO release (measured as nitrite
   production) and K+ channel activity (measured as Rb-86(+) efflux) were
   measured in cells grown on collagen-coated microcarrier beads and
   perfused in a column. An eightfold increase in flow produced a rapid
   (within 1 min), sustained, and reversible sixfold increase in NO
   release. Efflux of Rb-86(+) also increased but rapidly returned to
   baseline and then transiently decreased when flow was decreased. This
   was probably due to boundary layer washout rather than to K+ channel
   activation, because an identical pattern was seen for release of
   {[}H-3]ouabain. Neither tetraethylammonium nor increasing medium {[}K+]
   to block K+ currents prevented flow-induced NO release. Removal of
   medium Ca2+ or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ also did not block
   flow-mediated NO release. The results demonstrate that flow rapidly
   increases NO release from endothelial cells but that this increase in NO
   release is not dependent on activation of K+ channels or changes in
   intracellular {[}Ca2+].}},

Abstract = {{Infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major unsolved
   challenge for vaccine development. RSV is worldwide in distribution and
   infects almost all children during the first 2 yr of life. The mouse
   model of RSV lu ng disease has been very successful in reproducing many
   aspects of the hu man disease. In particular, the role of antiviral T
   cells in both eliminating virus and causing enhanced disease has been
   shown dramatically. This immunopathologic paradox is now more clearly
   understood than for any other common human infection, largely due to
   insights gained from the mouse model. This review focuses on the unique
   ability of different RSV proteins to prime for specific functional
   subsets in the mouse, and the association between sensitization to the
   major surface glycoprotein G, the induction of T helper 2 cells, and the
   subsequent appearance of lung eosinophilia during RSV infection.}},

Abstract = {{Southern blot analysis of Hodgkin's disease (HD), although often
   compromised by the small number of abnormal cells present in the tissue,
   have tended to favor a B-cell derivation of the Hodgkin's and
   Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in cases of nodular sclerosis (NS) and mixed
   cellularity (MC) Hodgkin's disease. Eighteen frozen and 29
   paraffin-embedded sections of lymph node specimens from 29 patients with
   pretreatment HD (22 NSHD and 7 MCHD) were studied by molecular analysis
   and immunohistochemistry to determine the phenotype of HRS cells. All
   cases were reviewed and showed typical morphology and CD45-, CD30+,
   CD15+, BLA.36+ HRS cells. In 11 of 29 (38\%) cases, HRS cells were
   reactive with at least one B-cell marker (CD20, CD79a, MB2), 7 of 29
   (24\%) cases showed reactivity with the T-cell marker CD3, and 11 of 29
   (38\%) cases displayed a `'null'' phenotype. By using a polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) and consensus primers for the V and J regions of the
   immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene, the authors were able to detect
   B-cell clonality in 9 of 18 (50\%) frozen samples of HD analyzed. IgH
   gene rearrangement was present in 8 of 15 (53\%) NSHD and in 1 of 3
   (33\%) MCHD. In five of nine (56\%) of these cases. HRS cells were
   reactive with at least one B-cell marker, whereas one case expressed the
   T-cell marker CD3. The other three cases with IgH gene rearrangement
   showed a `'null'' immunophenotype. IgH gene analysis was negative in all
   remaining CD3+ cases and in two other cases that expressed B-cell
   markers by immunohistology. Southern blotting failed to detect
   rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene and immunoglobulin
   heavy and light genes in any of these cases. The results show that PCR
   represents a specific and sensitive technique for the detection of IgH
   gene rearrangements in cases of Hodgkin's disease. The results also
   suggest a lymphoid B-cell derivation of HRS cells in a high proportion
   of the cases.}},

Abstract = {{1. Hepatocytes isolated from the adult male NMRI mouse or Wistar rat
   were incubated for 1 h with 0.5 mM C-14-benzene, the supernatant was
   separated from the cells, and analysed for benzene metabolites.
   Separately, formation of sulphate conjugates during benzene metabolism
   was studied in hepatocytes in the presence of S-35-sulphate. In addition
   sulphate conjugation of the benzene metabolites hydroquinone and
   1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene was investigated in mouse liver cytosol
   supplemented with 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phospho-(35)-sulphate.
   2. Two novel metabolites, not detectable in rat hepatocyte incubations,
   were found in mouse hepatocytes, and were identified as
   1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene sulphate and hydroquinone sulphate. Formation of
   the S-35-labelled conjugates could be demonstrated in incubations of
   mouse liver cytosol with hydroquinone or 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene
   supplemented with 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phospho-S-35-sulphate, and in
   mouse hepatocytes incubated with benzene and S-35-sulphate.
   3. In comparison with hepatocytes from the Wistar rat, hepatocytes from
   the NMRI mouse were almost three times more effective in metabolizing
   benzene. The higher formation of hydroquinone, and the formation of
   trihydroxybenzene sulphate and hydroquinone sulphate, mainly contributed
   to the higher rate of benzene metabolism.
   4. In conclusion, qualitative and quantitative differences in benzene
   metabolism may contribute to the higher susceptibility of mouse towards
   the myelotoxic and leucaemogenic action of benzene.}},

Abstract = {{Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) studies have been carried out on a
   binary mixture of polystyrene-h(8) particles (A, radius 168 Angstrom)
   and polystyrene-d(8) particles (B, radius 510 Angstrom). Two dispersions
   were prepared at a total volume fraction of ca. 0.03 and with number
   ratios N-A/N-B of 9 and 15. The electrolyte content of these dispersions
   was 6 x 10(-5) mol dm(-3) sodium chloride. Experiments were carried out
   at 3 contrasts using H2O, 75\% D2O, and D2O so that the data obtained
   enabled evaluation of the three partial structure factors, S(Q)(AA),
   S(Q)(BB), and S(Q)(AB). Prior to examining the mixtures, separate SANS
   experiments were carried out to characterize the particles and to obtain
   the structure factors for the individual latices, S(Q)(A) and S(Q)(B).
   This enabled a comparison to be made of the single-component dispersions
   and the binary mixtures. The results indicate that the larger particles
   retain their structure in the mixture but that the structure of the
   smaller particles is distorted with evidence of long-range correlations
   resulting in `'weak'' cluster formation. The variation in the partial
   structure factors is consistent with the calculation that the strongest
   electrostatic interaction is between the larger B particles and the
   weakest between the smaller A particles.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of infusion of clonidine, an alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, on
   plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations were
   investigated with a single growth hormone (GH) injection in pigs. Four
   barrows were subjected to four treatments: saline infusion with a
   vehicle injection, clonidine infusion (0.5 nmol/kg/min for 8 h) with a
   vehicle injection, saline infusion with a bovine GH (bGH: 100 mu g/kg)
   injection, and clonidine infusion with a bGH injection. Infusion was
   started 1 h before the injection. Plasma IGF-I, bGH, porcine GH (pGH),
   insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), and blood urea
   nitrogen (BUN) concentrations were measured. Plasma IGF-I concentrations
   during saline infusion increased after a bGH injection (P<0.05).
   However, the IGF-1 concentrations during clonidine infusion did not
   increase after the bGH injection. Plasma endogenous GH (pGH) was not
   increased during clonidine infusion. The plasma glucose concentration
   was noticeably increased during clonidine infusion and moderately
   increased after the GH injection. Despite the extreme increase in plasma
   glucose during clonidine infusion, plasma insulin did not change.
   Neither plasma NEFA nor BUN was changed by these treatments. These
   results demonstrate that the alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist clonidine
   altered the action of GH to increase the plasma IGF-I concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective - Coeur en sante St-Henri is a five year, community
   based, multifactorial, heart health promotion programme in a low income,
   low education neighbourhood in Montreal, Canada. The objectives of this
   programme are to improve heart-healthy behaviours among adults of
   St-Henri. This paper describes the theoretical model underlying
   programme development as well as out early field experience implementing
   interventions.
   Design - The design of the intervention programme is based on a
   behaviour change model adapted from social learning theory, the reasoned
   action model, and the precede-proceed model. The Ottawa charter for
   health promotion provided the framework for the development of specific
   interventions. Each intervention is submitted to formative,
   implementation, and impact evaluations using simple and inexpensive
   methods.
   Participant - The target population consists of adults living in
   St-Henri, a neighbourhood of 23 360 residents. Because of costs
   constraints, the intervention strategy targets women more specifically.
   The community is one of the poorest in Canada with 46\% of the
   population living below the poverty line and 20\% being very poor. The
   age-sex adjusted ischaemic heart disease mortality in 1985-87 was 317
   per 100 000 compared with 126 per 100 000 in an affluent adjacent
   neighbourhood.
   Results - Thirty nine distinct interventions have been developed and
   tested in the community, eight related to tobacco, 10 to diet, seven to
   physical activity, and 14 which are multifactorial. The interventions
   include smoking cessation adn healthy recipes contests, a menu labelling
   and healthy food discount programme in restaurants, a point of choice
   nutrition education campaign, healthy eating and smoking cessation
   workshops, a walking club, educational material, print and electronic
   media campaigns, heart health fairs, and community events.
   Conclusion - An integrated heart health promotion programme is feasible
   in low income urban neighbourhoods but not all intervention are
   successful. Such a programme requires substantial energy and resources
   as well as long term commitment from public health departments.}},

Abstract = {{Using a modified gas chromatograph, gas evolution experiments have been

Abstract = {{Acp26Aa is a Drosophila seminal fluid protein that plays a role in the
   elevation of egg-laying by the mated female and has structural features
   of a prohormone. The protein, which has a region of sequence similarity
   to the egg-laying hormone of Aplysia, is transferred to the Drosophila
   female during mating. Acp26Aa is processed in the mated female's genital
   tract. We show here that the processing involves sequential proteolytic
   cleavages, and we map the position of these cleavages. Although Acp26Aa
   is not cleaved in the male, its processing in the mated female requires
   activities donated by the male. Acp26Aa ectopically expressed in unmated
   females is not processed. Processing of Acp26Aa in wild-type females
   mated to males with altered seminal fluid is dependent on the presence
   and amount of male accessory gland secretions. The need for molecular
   cooperation between the sexes for processing of Acp26Aa could restrict
   its activity to the mated female. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{It is now well known that the compounds that belong to the
   R(2)Fe(3)Si(5) series exhibit unusual superconducting and magnetic
   properties. Although a reasonable number of studies have been made on
   this series, similar efforts on another series, namely, R(2)Rh(3)Si(5),
   whose structure is closely related to R(2)Fe(3)Si(5), have not been
   made. In this paper, we have established the bulk superconductivity in
   La2Rh3Si5 below 4.4 K and bulk antiferromagnetism in Nd2Rh3Si5 below 2.7
   K, from resistivity, susceptibility, and heat-capacity studies. The
   superconducting transition temperature of (T-c) La2Rh3Si5 decreases with
   the Nd substitution for La and we have analyzed this T-c dependence
   using Abrikosov and Gor'kov theory with crystal-held contributions. The
   estimated value of the interaction between the conduction electrons and
   the rare-earth spin (J(sf)) is 37 meV, which is adequate to suppress the
   coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in
   La2-xNdxRh3Si5 alloys above 0.6 K. Finally, we have also analyzed the
   temperature dependence of the upper critical field of Nd-doped La2Rh3Si5
   alloys using a theory which incorporates spin-orbit coupling with an
   additional pair breaking parameter.}},

Abstract = {{It has been known for half a century that the hydrostatic or buoyant
   force acting on a planing hull in motion is less than Archimedes' force,
   the weight of the volume of water displaced by the hull, and that this
   results in the low speed `'hump drag'' of a relatively deep draft
   vessel, such as a catamaran, being much greater than the conventionally
   calculated value, Payne {[}(1988) Design of High Speed Boars, Volume 1:
   Planing. Fishergate Inc., Annapolis, Maryland] suggested a reason for
   this and discussed the various two-dimensional flow analyses of a flat
   plate planing on a heavy fluid which gave similar results, but did not
   present experimental data for the phenomena. The omission is repaired in
   the present paper, together with empirical equations which correlate
   these data.
   Some modifications have been made to coefficients employed in the
   `'added mass'' equations for planing forces given in earlier papers, as
   a result of recent research. The modified equations are presented and
   compared with the available experimental data.
   It is concluded that the equations earlier presented, as slightly
   modified in the present paper, agree with the means of 1099 towing tank
   experiments to within 3\%. The experimental scatter for individual
   experiments was typically +/-20\% and, for some experimenters, more than
   +/-40\% about this mean. It is, perhaps, not generally realized that
   experimental measurements can be so imprecise. It also seems clear that
   some experimenters obtained consistently higher or lower lift forces
   than others under the same test conditions. While the paper cannot claim
   to be a comprehensive critical survey of all the `'classical'' planing
   data, it does attempt to identify some of the anomalous variations
   between experimenters.}},

   this treatment for a further 2 weeks. The remainder received either
   FPANS 200 mu g od or FPANS 200 mu g bd for a further 2 weeks. Efficacy
   was evaluated by the analysis of symptom-free days. In the uncontrolled
   group, there was a significant increase in the percentage of
   symptom-free days in the FPANS 200 mu g bd group over the FPANS 200 mu g
   od group for nasal blockage on waking (P < 0.05) and nasal blockage
   during the day (P < 0.05). Similar trends were observed for sneezing,

Abstract = {{Tumor resistance to the glycopeptide anticancer drug bleomycin (BLM) has
   been suggested to involve metabolic inactivation by BLM hydrolase.
   Direct evidence for this hypothesis is lacking due to difficulties in
   obtaining full-length BLM hydrolase cDNA from mammalian cells. In the
   present investigation, we used the yeast cysteine proteinase gene ycp1,
   a homologue of the mammalian BLM hydrolase gene, to provide direct
   evidence of the importance of BLM metabolism in BLM resistance.
   Transfection of ycp1 into NIH 3T3 cells induced resistance of these
   cells to BLM. The ycp1-transfected cells also metabolized BLM A(2) to
   its inactive metabolite deamido-BLM A(2) to a much greater extent. The
   ycp1-induced BLM resistance was completely reversed by the cysteine
   proteinase inhibitor E-64, a known inhibitor of BLM hydrolase.
   Transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with the plasmid pUT533-Sh ble, a
   bacterial BLM resistance gene that encodes a 14-kDa protein that does
   not metabolize BLM, also induced BLM resistance, but this resistance was
   not overcome by E-64. The results demonstrate that increased BLM
   hydrolase activity in NIH 3T3 cells causes BLM resistance and that
   inhibition of BLM metabolism sensitizes these cells to BLM. Thus, the
   molecular approach described in the present study directly implicates
   BLM hydrolase in BLM resistance.}},

   alpha(2)-macroglobulin, soybean trypsin inhibitor and plasma. The
   blocking of protease inhibition showed an optimum at a

   alpha(1)-protease inhibitor. Heparin 10-saccharides and 20-saccharides
   were inefficient in preventing the interaction of RMCP-1 with
   alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, whereas pig mucosal heparin (approximate to
   50 monosaccharide units) blocked protease inhibition. We have previously
   shown that heparin potentiates the catalytic activity of RMCP-1 and, in
   the present study, we show that the mechanism for chymase activation
   involves a sixfold reduction of the K-m, (app) value of RMCP-1 for the
   chromogenic substrate S-2586. Thus, the association of mast cell chymase
   with heparin proteoglycan may serve both to potentiate the catalytic
   activity of the enzyme and to increase the life-span of the chymases by
   preventing their inhibition after exocytosis.}},

Abstract = {{Using double staining for T-cell receptor (TCR) and
   5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BRdU) we have examined the proliferation rates
   and lifespan of murine intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL's) in vivo.
   After a 24-hr pulse of BRdU the number of labelled alpha beta TCR(+) IEL
   was significantly higher in the ileum than the duodenum. In contrast,
   incorporation of BRdU into gamma delta TCR(+) IEL was significantly
   higher in the duodenum than the ileum. This regional variation was also
   seen after a 4-hr pulse of BRdU indicating that the differences probably
   reflect local rates of proliferation in the epithelium. Over a 6-day
   labelling period, the accumulation of labelled alpha beta TCR(+) and
   gamma delta TCR(+) IEL was linear, which allowed IEL lifespan to be
   calculated. There was considerable variation between groups of mice but
   the 50\% population renewal time for alpha beta TCR(+) IEL was 12-36
   days in the duodenum and 9-11 days in the ileum, and for gamma delta
   TCR(+) IEL was 12-21 days in the duodenum and 26-100 days in the ileum.
   The incorporation of BRdU into V beta 8(+) IEL showed the same regional
   variation as alpha beta TCR(+) IEL and the V delta 4 population behaved
   like the total gamma delta TCR(+) IEL population. In contrast V beta
   11(+), potentially self-reactive IEL, showed a regional pattern of
   labelling like gamma delta TCR(+) IEL. Incorporation of BRdU into both
   alpha beta TCR(+) and gamma delta TCR(+) IEL in germ-free mice was very
   low and did not show marked regional variation. alpha beta TCR(+) and
   gamma delta TCR(+) IEL from both proximal and distal bowel were
   cytotoxic. Therefore alpha beta TCR(+) and gamma delta TCR(+) IEL show
   different rates of division in different sections of the gut, perhaps
   reflecting responses to different antigens. Both alpha beta TCR(+) and
   gamma delta TCR(+) IEL reside in the epithelium for weeks during which
   time the gut epithelial population will have been renewed many times.}},

Abstract = {{The CA (capsid) protein of avian sarcoma and leukemia viruses occurs in
   multiple species. Only one form has been previously characterized
   biochemically. We have now determined that the mature CA protein of
   avian sarcoma and leukemia viruses exists as three species with
   different C termini, ending in amino acid residues A-476, A-478, and
   M-479 of the Gag precursor, respectively. These structures were deduced
   from a combination of cyanogen bromide peptide mapping, sequence
   analysis of tryptic peptides, and electrospray mass spectrometry. The
   three forms of CA were detected in the same ratios in Rous sarcoma virus
   and avian myeloblastosis virus and therefore are likely to represent a
   common feature of members of this genus of avian retroviruses. The only
   previously reported CA species, CA(M-479), accounts for only about 36\%
   of the total CA protein, while CA(A-476) and CA(A-478) account for 55
   and 9\%, respectively. From the analysis of peptides cleaved in vitro by
   PR, the viral protease, we infer that the cleavage site between A-476
   and A-477 not only is recognized by PR but is the preferred site. We
   were unable to determine if A-478/A-479 is a cleavage site for PR or
   alternatively if CA(A-478) results from further processing of CA(M-479)
   by a carboxypeptidase. To study the biological significance of residues
   A-477 to M-479, we constructed genetically altered viruses in which
   deletions removed either residues 477 to 479 or 477 to 488. The
   resulting virus particles appeared to assembly with normal efficiencies,
   but the latter mutant showed slowed proteolytic processing. Neither of
   the mutants was infectious.}},

Abstract = {{The Santorini complex is the most active volcano of the southern Aegean
   volcanic are. Its relationship to the surrounding area was examined by
   using a dense set of seismic reflection profiles.
   Three seismic units were recognized in the surrounding area. Unit A
   consists of generally strong subparallel continuous reflectors, into
   which two subunits A1 and A2 were distinguished, that are unconformable
   in the upper slopes and the shelves and conformable at lower sectors.
   The age of unit A, which consists mainly of volcaniclastic sediments, is
   considered Quaternary. Unit B consists of faulted and slightly folded
   strong continuous reflectors that pinch out at lower basin margin
   sectors than unit A. Its age is mainly Pliocene, its sediments are
   probably terrigenous, and it was deposited in the basins at the early
   and middle stages of their formation. Finally unit C represents the
   acoustic (mainly metamorphic) basement. The dominant tectonic structure
   in the area is the NE-SW trending normal faults, superimposed on earlier
   E-W normal faults.
   The Santorini complex includes one caldera at Santorini and one crater
   at Columbus about 7 km to the northeast. The caldera of Santorini
   consists of four deep basins (depth from 290 to 390 m). The Columbus
   volcano has a well defined crater with a single basin (depth similar to
   500 m) and was formed in 1650 A.D. by an underwater explosion.
   The start of volcanic activity of Santorini, which initiated in the
   Early Pleistocene and continues up until today, may be related to the
   change in the normal fault orientation from E-W to NE-SW, and to the
   unconformity between units A and B.}},

   all. When individuals bear the cost of their own health care, they
   appear to take responsibility for health implications of personal
   behaviour, but when the state bears the cost, moral obligations of the
   community and its doctors to care for those who do not value health are
   called into question. The debate has far-reaching implications as
   ethical problems of smokers' rights to health care are common to
   situations where health as a value comes into conflict with other

Abstract = {{Cyclic stretch of cultured urinary tract smooth muscle cells has been
   used to mimic some of the events that occur with bladder obstruction.
   The stretch stimulus induces production of nerve growth factor (NGF),
   which has been implicated in changes in bladder innervation.
   Stretch-induced NGF production was blocked by actinomycin. Involvement
   of protein kinase C (PKC) in the stretch-induced NGF production is
   strongly suggested by the following observations. Phorbol ester
   activators of PKC mimicked the stretch response as did platelet-derived
   growth factor (PDGF), which acts, in part, through generation of
   endogenous diacylglycerols. Both stretch- and PDGF-induced NGF
   production were blocked by prolonged incubation with phorbol ester to
   downregulate PKC. Western blot analysis confirmed partial downregulation
   of the Ca2+-dependent PKC-alpha and PKC-beta 1 and near complete
   downregulation of the Ca2+-independent PKC isozymes delta, epsilon, and
   zeta. The involvement of PKC in transducing a physical stimulus
   (stretch) into a biochemical response (NGF production) has implications
   for novel types of therapeutic intervention in ailments such as bladder
   obstruction.}},

Abstract = {{We present our experience in the treatment of 1,300 wounded at the Rama
   war hospital in Bosnia and Hercegovina. Rama surgical teams performed
   mainly chest, abdominal and vascular operations, and other operations if
   the patient's life was considered to be in danger. All severely wounded
   patients were transported in a stable hemodynamic state to the Split
   University Hospital within 48 to 72 h, as the Rama hospital was
   primarily an evacuation facility. Owing to the well-organized first aid
   provided and the rapid evacuation from the combat line, all patients
   were operated within 3 h after injury. This, together with the excellent
   functioning of our blood bank were factors responsible for our good
   results. Among the 226 casualties operated under general anesthesia,
   mortality was 8.4\% (19 cases). The most common causes of death were
   multiple injury and irreversible hemorrhagic shock.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To compare the DNA content measured by flow cytometry (FCM)
   and image analysis (IA) fuom prostatic fine needle aspiration (FNA)
   samples.
   STUDY DESIGN: A total of 48 samples were studied. FCM was performed on
   propidium iodide-stained nuclei according to the Vindelov method, and
   image analysis was performed on Feulgen-stained slides. Positive FNA
   results were graded (1-3) and compared with Gleason grades.
   RESULTS: Aneuploidy was closely related to positive FNA results (P
   <.01). DNA histograms were found to be aneuploid in all grade 3
   carcinomas (n = 13) by IA and in 11 cases (84.6\%) by FCM. Grade 2
   carcinomas (n = 9) were found to be aneuploid with both methods. In
   grade 1 carcinomas (n = 10), 2 cases exhibited IA aneuploid profiles,
   whereas all FCM cases were diploid. Aneuploid profiles were more often
   associated with high Gleason scores than were diploid ones (P <.01).
   Among the 16 patients with negative FNA results, two cases had
   tetraploid DNA profiles related to contaminating seminal vesicle cells.
   The difference in DNA measurements reached 10.4\% but was not
   statistically significant.
   CONCLUSION: These findings show that the two methods, as applied to
   prostatic FNA samples, give comparable results and that seminal vesicle
   cells may be responsible for false tetraploid profiles.}},

Abstract = {{When poly(methyl methacrylate) films containing UV absorbers are exposed
   to UV light, the absorbers undergo photodegradation resulting in loss of
   absorbance. If the data extend for less than one half-life, both zero
   and first order kinetic treatment give fairly linear fits, but the rate
   constants so derived are dependent on the initial absorbance of the
   films. When the zero order rate constants are corrected to account for
   the higher rate of degradation near the surface compared with the bulk
   that occurs in highly absorbing films, consistent `'infinite
   absorption'' zero order rate constants are derived. The inhomogeneous
   degradation is due to only the highly absorbed, higher energy light
   contributing significantly to the degradation. For the benzophenone and
   benzotriazole classes of absorber, at least 65\% of the degradation is
   due to light with wavelengths < 350 nm. Structural variations generally
   caused only small differences in the rates of degradation of these
   classes of absorbers unless the substitutions disrupted the
   intramolecular hydrogen bonds that are critical for stability. If the
   hydrogen bond is weakened, the absorber is less stable.}},

Abstract = {{Because alveolar macrophages generate and release reactive oxygen
   metabolites but also contain antioxidative enzymes, they have the
   potential of either damaging or protecting tissues. We investigated the
   relative role of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-scavenging antioxidative
   enzymes in H2O2 disposal and cell protection using freshly isolated (5 h
   ex vivo) and overnight (24 h ex vivo) cultured human alveolar
   macrophages. Cell protection was assessed on the basis of maintenance of
   cellular high-energy phosphates, leakage of intact nucleotides into the
   extracellular medium, and appearance of the nucleotide catabolic
   products xanthine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid. To investigate the
   relative importance of catalase and the glutathione redox cycle, the
   experiments were conducted in cells pretreated with amino-triazole (ATZ)
   to inactivate catalase or with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea
   (BCNU) to inactivate glutathione reductase. Catalase, glutathione
   peroxidase, and glutathione reductase activities did not change
   significantly during overnight culture of the cells. Both freshly
   isolated and cultured cells consumed exogenous H2O2 mainly by the
   catalase-dependent pathway. When the cells were exposed to H2O2 (100 mu
   M), catalase and the glutathione redox cycle equally participated in
   maintaining cellular high-energy nucleotides. However, when cultured
   cells were exposed to formylated peptide (FMLP) (10(-7) M), the
   glutathione redox cycle was responsible for the maintenance of
   high-energy nucleotides. Furthermore, in both exposures, the glutathione
   redox cycle was more important in maintaining cell membrane integrity
   and preventing nucleotide leakage from the cells. Immunocytochemical
   labeling showed that catalase was primarily localized in the peroxisomal
   compartment of these cells, In conclusion, the results with
   FMLP-stimulated cells suggest that in human alveolar macrophages not
   only catalase but especially the glutathione redox cycle participate in
   maintaining the cellular integrity of alveolar macrophages during their
   respiratory burst in vivo.}},

   of the drivers for IS/IT outsourcing, the organizational structure of
   the IS/IT function, human resource management and the changing
   organizational ownership of IS/IT competences. Large organizations,
   along with the public sector, are resourcing a new network of
   organizations of IS/IT technical professionals and knowledge workers. We
   argue that the growth of the IS/IT vendor industry, stimulated by the
   increased demand for outsourcing, is creating a new professional service

Abstract = {{Fourteen patients with traumatic hip dislocation had serial magnetic
   resonance imaging and routine radiographic studies from the time of
   injury through 24 months after injury, One experienced radiologist
   interpreted all images prospectively for abnormalities suggesting
   osteonecrosis of the femoral head and posttraumatic arthritis, Eight
   hips demonstrated abnormal marrow signals on T-1 and T-2 weighted images
   within 6 weeks of injury, These changes progressed in 3 hips, and
   osteonecrosis was confirmed subsequently by plain radiography, The
   abnormal marrow signals in the remaining 5 hips proved to be transient,
   resolving on magnetic resonance images within 3 months in 4 of the 5
   patients, Magnetic resonance imaging can be used with confidence for the
   early detection of osteonecrosis of the femoral head after traumatic hip
   dislocation or fracture-dislocation. The presence of acetabular or
   femoral shaft hardware did not preclude magnetic resonance imaging
   assessment of these patients when coronal, sagittal, and axial images
   were obtained, Magnetic resonance imaging was not reliable for assessing
   marrow changes, within the first week after injury, nor was it helpful
   in predicting which patients were at risk for posttraumatic arthritis to
   develop, An algorithm is proposed for using magnetic resonance imaging

Abstract = {{The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) utilizes
   chemical-specific minimal risk levels (MRLs) to assist in evaluating
   public health risks associated with exposure to hazardous substances.
   During MRL derivation, uncertainty factors (UF) are used. Under current
   ATSDR methodology, default UFs of 10 are applied to extrapolate from a
   lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) to a
   no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), for interspecies extrapolation
   and for intraspecies variability, However, chemical-specific toxicity
   information has sometimes made it necessary and appropriate to deviate
   from using the standard UF of 10. Since its inception in January 1993
   until December 1994, ATSDR's Interagency MRL Workgroup has derived 46
   inhalation and 67 oral MRLs. When the substance-specific data permitted,
   the workgroup departed from the default UFs of 10 in 30 specific cases.
   Specific examples and rationales are presented in this paper. (C) 1995

   heavy metals Ni, Pb, Cd, Zn and Cu, in two levels, were added to the
   soils, in the residue derived from the SITEL, the integrated wastewater
   treatment of Polo Petroquimico do Sul (South Petrochemical Complex)
   applied in doses of 0, 5.0 and 8.5 g kg(-1). The heavy metals in the
   residue were distributed in forms of different availabilities. The lack
   of toxicity symptoms and the high tolerance indeces showed that the
   heavy metals, in the study conditions, did not damage the rye grass
   growth. The chelating agents EDTA and DTPA were not efficient to
   evaluate the available Pb and Ni, and the CaCl2 was the more efficient
   extraction reagent to evaluate the available Cd to the plants.}},

Abstract = {{The shape, projection, ultrastructure and chemistry of interneurons that
   were initially identified by their immunoreactivity for somatostatin in
   the small intestine of the guinea pig were examined. Somatostatin
   immunoreactive nerve cell bodies and nerve fibres were located in the
   myenteric plexus. Simultaneous labelling for 2 antigens revealed that
   the somatostatin immunoreactive interneurons were also immunoreactive
   for choline acetyltransferase, but not for calbindin or neuropeptide Y.
   Cell shapes were determined by immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural
   analysis and intracellular dye filling. The neurons had large cell
   bodies (38 x 14 mu m) which gave rise to long branched filamentous
   dendrites and a single axon. The projections of the somatostatin
   immunoreactive interneurons were determined by analysis of patterns of
   fibre loss and survival following degenerative section of myenteric
   nerve pathways and by analysis of individual neurons that were injected
   intracellularly with dye. The axons projected anally, sometimes after a
   short oral excursion, and were confined to the myenteric plexus. They
   gave rise to multiple varicose branches within myenteric ganglia: in the
   majority of cases the first branch was within 100 mu m of the cell body.
   Synaptic inputs to the cells were examined by light and electron
   microscopy. All somatostatin immunoreactive neurons received numerous
   somatostatin immunoreactive inputs on the cell body and all filamentous
   processes. Ultrastructural investigation indicated that these
   constituted the majority of all inputs. It. is concluded that
   cholinergic, somatostatin immunoreactive, interneurons have a unique
   soma morphology and form synaptically connected chains that run anally
   in the myenteric plexus.}},

Abstract = {{In the literature different results can be found on the frequency
   dependence of spaciousness. In three groups of psyche-physical
   experiments, having in common headphone presentation of signals and
   perceived width as subjective criterion, the frequency dependence of
   spaciousness has been investigated systematically. In the first
   experiment, the perceived width of narrow-band noise stimuli at a
   constant sensation level of 50 dB was scaled as a function of center
   frequency, band width and cross-correlation coefficient. Generally,
   spaciousness is found to increase for lower frequencies. In the second
   experiment this result was confirmed also for lower sensation levels of
   octave-band noise signals of which the perceived width was matched
   against the perceived width of a white noise stimulus by varying its
   cross-correlation coefficient. The influence of the salience of stimuli
   was discarded by this procedure. In the third experiment, the relative
   contribution to spaciousness of a single octave-band amidst the
   complementary band-reject noise was studied by varying the relative
   level or the cross-correlation coefficient of the octave band. It turned
   out that a frequency band around 500 Hz is optimal for spaciousness.
   This result agrees with the dominance of this very region for
   lateralization.}},

   plasma cGMP in an animal model of chronic renal failure (remnant kidney
   model excision) and sham-operated rats.
   3. Sub-total nephrectomy induced a significant fall in haematocrit and a
   significant increase in plasma creatinine levels. Treatment with r-hu
   EPO resulted in a significant haematocrit increase in uraemic as well as
   in non-uraemic rats. Despite this effect, r-hu EPO treatment had no
   effect on SBP in sham-operated rats. On the contrary, this treatment
   caused significant SBP elevation in uraemic rats; in these rats, SBP
   increase did not correlate with haematocrit increase.
   4. Plasma cGMP concentrations were significantly higher in uraemic
   compared to sham-operated rats and were not modified by r-hu EPO
   treatment.

   reaction pi(+)d --> pp at incident-pion energies of 350, 400, and 450
   MeV were carried out in the angular region theta(c.m.s) > 40 degrees. A
   fast rise in the vector analyzing power is found at 450 MeV. This rise
   can be related to a well-known feature in the behavior of the asymmetry
   A(y0) in the inverse reaction pp --> d pi(+). The behavior of iT(11) at
   energies of 350 and 400 MeV was found to be in agreement with
   predictions of the Arndt phase analysis {[}5].}},

Abstract = {{The terrestrial magnetopause region shows a big variety of different
   structures and properties depending on different situations, mainly in
   the free solar wind. In a recent paper, Song et al. (1993) reported a
   multi-instrument study on magnetopause parameters on November 1, 1978,
   1510-1530 UT. We complement this descriptive study by examining this
   event in terms of a reconnection model. For doing this we, use a
   shock-type reconnection model which allows for magnetic fields of
   arbitrary strength and skew and for arbitrary plasma flows on either
   side of the reconnection layer as well as for different densities. Thus
   we are able to model the magnetopause structure within a big parameter
   regime. We show that the entire sequence of regions and discontinuities
   detected on November 1, 1978, 1510-1530 UT, and reported by Song et al.
   (1993) agrees with the magnetopause. structure predicted by our
   reconnection model. However, we point out that some features of the.
   data need additional assumptions, which make the problem open for
   future. study.}},

Abstract = {{4-OH-tamoxifen is an active metabolite of tamoxifen that is detectable
   in the serum and tumour tissue of patients treated by oral tamoxifen. As
   this metabolite penetrates through the skin, it is possible to compare
   percutaneous LF-OH-tamoxifen (4-OH-TAM) and oral tamoxifen treatments.
   We report herein a randomized study of percutaneous 4-OH-TAM versus oral
   tamoxifen in women with breast cancer. This pharmacology study was
   designed to compare the 4-OH-TAM concentration in breast cancer and
   normal breast tissue according to the route and dose used for
   adminstration of tamoxifen after a 3-week period prior to surgery and
   tissue sampling;. Women were randomized into one of the five following
   groups: group I, oral tamoxifen given at 10 mg twice a day; group II,
   4-OH-TAM delivered percutaneously at 0.5 mg day to both breast areas;
   group III, 4-OH-TAM applied percutaneously at 1 mg/day to both breast
   areas; group IV, 4-OH-TAM delivered percutaneously at 1 mg/day to a
   large cutaneous area excluding the breasts; and group V, 4-OH-TAM
   applied percutaneously at 2 mg/day to a large skin area excluding the
   breasts. 4-OH-TAM plasma and tissue concentrations were significantly
   higher in the oral tamoxifen group as compared with either the high- or
   the low-dose percutaneous 4-OH-TAM group. In group II, percutaneous
   4-OH-TAM treatment resulted in tissue concentrations of 1,446 and 352
   pg/g in tumour tissue and normal breast tissue, respectively. In group I
   these concentrations were as follows: tumour tissue, 12, 453 pg/g; and
   normal tissue, 10,214 pg/g. 4-OH-TAM concentrations in tumour tissue and
   normal breast tissue did not significantly differ in any group. In the
   oral group we observed classic effects on coagulation and lipid
   metabolism when pre- and post-treatment values of these biological
   variables were compared, whereas no difference was observed in the
   percutaneous group. Although precutaneous administration of 4-OH-TAM led
   to a low plasmatic concentration of this active metabolite, the breast
   tissue concentration remained lower than those observed after oral
   tamoxifen treatment. Therefore, at the doses described in this study,
   percutaneous 4-OH-TAM cannot be proposed as an alternative tamoxifen
   treatment.}},

   All of the remaining 12 patients tolerated divalproex sodium well with
   no significant change in MMSE scores (P = .486), CMAI scores (P =

Abstract = {{Study objective: To compare the effectiveness and incidence of adverse
   reactions with three treatment regimens for asthma in adults in the
   prehospital setting.
   Design: Prospective, randomized clinical study.
   Setting: inner-city emergency medical service system providing basic and
   advanced life support and transport to 14 urban area hospital emergency
   departments.
   Participants: One hundred fifty-four adult asthmatic patients, 18 to 50
   years old, who presented to paramedics with shortness of breath and
   wheezing.
   Results: Eligible patients were randomly assigned by the base station
   physician to one of three treatment groups: subcutaneous epinephrine,
   nebulized metaproterenol, or subcutaneous epinephrine and nebulized
   metaproterenol. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), blood pressure, heart
   rate, and respiratory rate were measured before and after treatment in
   each patient. During a 9-month period (October 1992 through June 1993),
   154 patients were enrolled in the study; 53 (34\%) received epinephrine,
   49 (32\%) received metaproterenol, and 52 (34\%) received both. There
   were no significant differences in patient demographics, initial vital
   signs, or pretreatment PEFR among the three groups. The mean difference
   between pretreatment and posttreatment PEFR was 73 L/min and did not
   significantly differ among the treatment groups. Significant changes in
   vital signs were seen in no treatment group.
   Conclusion: Nebulized metaproterenol is as effective as subcutaneous
   epinephrine in the prehospital treatment of adult patients with acute
   asthma. The combination of these two treatments offered no additional
   clinical benefit in the patients we studied.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of primitive hematologic malignancies in extramedullary
   sites (lymphoblastic lymphoma of T- or B-cell type and myeloid sarcoma)
   on paraffin-embedded tissue sections is difficult and often impossible
   because of the primitive morphology of the neoplastic cells. The authors
   studied 21 extramedullary tumors of lymphoid or myeloid blasts. They
   used a panel of 22 antibodies on frozen sections and 9 antibodies on
   paraffin sections to determine the spectrum of immunophenotypes and to
   develop a practical panel for diagnosis. All but two of the cases could
   be classified as lymphoid or myeloid using immunohistologic analysis,
   Thirteen cases were classified as lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia (LBL/ALL); 10 were classified as precursor T
   (CD7+, CD3+/-, CD45+) and 3 as precursor B-cell (CD19+/- CD10+ CD45-)
   type. Five cases were classified as myeloid sarcoma (CD13+
   myeloperoxidase+, lysozyme+). Two LBL/ALL coexpressed either CD33 (1
   case) or CD15 (1 case), and one myeloid sarcoma coexpressed TdT and CD7.
   One case appeared to be truly mixed lineage, coexpressing CD3 with
   myeloperoxidase and lysozyme, and two cases expressed no
   lineage-specific antigens. There were clinical differences between the
   three major tumor types, and within the category of T-precursor LBL/ALL,
   classification according to stage of thymocyte differentiation was
   associated with distinctive clinical features.
   In conclusion, the spectrum of immunophenotypes detected on frozen
   section was similar to that reported by flow cytometry on peripheral
   blood and bone marrow specimens. The most useful antigens on frozen
   sections were CD7 and CD3 (T cell), CD10 and CD19 (B cell), and CD13
   (myeloid). TdT was coexpressed by one myeloid sarcoma and was
   undetectable in 40\% of LBL/ALL. On paraffin sections, myeloperoxidase
   and lysozyme were reliable markers of myeloid lineage, but none of the
   markers used on paraffin sections distinguished between LBL/ALL of T-
   and B-precursor types. Both B-LBL/ALL and myeloid sarcomas were often
   CD45- on paraffin sections, which may be a obstacle in determining the
   diagnosis. These distinctions appear to have clinical relevance.}},

Abstract = {{Communication between the oocyte and its somatic cells has been shown to
   be important in oocyte development. Here we examined how the oocyte may
   be involved in bovine cumulus cell expansion. Intact bovine cumulus
   oocyte complexes (COC) were obtained by puncturing antral follicles.
   From the intact COC, oocytectomised complexes (OOX) were produced by
   micro surgical removal of the oocyte. Clumps of cumulus cells (CC) were
   obtained by micro-dissection. Intact or OOX complexes or CC were matured
   in the presence of fetal calf serum and hFSH (6 mlU/ml) for 24 hr and
   the degree of expansion measured. The presence of the oocyte is not
   essential to allow bovine cumulus expansion to occur as expansion
   occurred in all groups. Murine OOX complexes from eCG primed
   35-40-day-old C57BL6/CBA F-1 hybrids (known to require the presence of
   an oocyte secreted factor for cumulus expansion) were cultured with or
   without denuded bovine oocytes (1 oocyte/mu l). Murine OOX complexes
   expanded only in the presence of denuded bovine oocytes. Thus some
   factor produced by bovine oocytes enabled expansion of murine OOX
   complexes. To determine whether the factor is secreted by bovine
   oocytes, murine OOX were cultured with or without media conditioned by
   bovine oocytes (1 oocyte/mu l for 4 hr). Significant expansion of murine
   OOX occurred in media conditioned by bovine oocytes. This shows that the
   cumulus expansion enabling effect of bovine oocytes is released into the
   surrounding media. Media conditioned by bovine oocytes and then frozen
   for up to 1 month showed that the activity by the factor can withstand
   freezing. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductors are prime examples of crystals which can be grown with
   unprecedented purity, imperfections being introduced deliberately in a
   controlled manner. However; even the chemically purest semiconductor is
   isotopically disordered as dictated by the natural abundance of
   elements. Diamonds have 98.9\% C-12 and 1.1\% C-13; silicon consists of
   92.23\% Si-28, 4.67\% Si-29 and 3.1\% Si-30 whereas germanium exhibits a
   large isotopic disorder originating in 21.23\% Ge-70, 27.66\% Ge-72,
   7.73\% Ge-73, 35.94\% Ge-74 and 7.44\% Ge-78! The isotopic composition
   of single crystal diamonds, controlled by the starting material used for
   growth by chemical vapor deposition followed by high temperature growth,
   provides a splendid opportunity to address the subtle manifestations of
   zero-point motion in their Brillouin and Raman spectra. Isotopically
   pure Ge shows mass dependent small shifts in its electronic band
   structure which can however be detected in the signatures observed in
   its modulated reflection and transmission spectra. The local modes of
   oxygen in isotopically pure Ge are observed by infrared spectroscopy as
   exceptionally sharp lines with striking fine structure. Substitutional
   incorporation of the lighter elements (e.g., Mg, Mn, Ca,...) in the
   II-VI semiconductors leads to sharp local modes (including isotopic
   shifts) in their infrared spectra.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the relationship between auditory steady-state
   evoked potentials (SSEPs) and behavioral thresholds in sleeping
   subjects.
   Design: 60 adults and children with hearing thresholds ranging from
   normal to profound were selected on the basis of appropriate audiograms.
   Behavioral audiograms were determined at the octave frequencies 250-4000
   Hz. These behavioral thresholds were then compared with the SSEP
   thresholds obtained during natural sleep for adults, or natural or
   sedated sleep for children.
   Results: A strong relationship between behavioral and SSEP thresholds
   was observed. The strength of the relationship increased with increasing
   frequency and increasing degree of the loss. On the basis of these data,
   the prediction of behavioral thresholds from SSEP levels was determined.
   It was found that the standard deviation of the error in this prediction
   decreased with increasing frequency and increasing degree of the loss,
   There was no significant age effect in the results obtained at any of
   the frequencies.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that the SSEP technique can be used as a
   predictor of behavioral thresholds in adults and children at the

Abstract = {{The isolation and characterization of baboon plasma factor V (FV) were
   performed for the development of an in vivo model for studying factor
   V/Va physiology in nonhuman primates. Baboon FV was purified by
   immunoaffinity chromatography with an antihuman FV monoclonal antibody
   and exhibits a specific activity of 1,940 U/mg. Baboon N activation by
   thrombin proceeds through two proteolytic pathways similar to those
   observed with human and bovine FV. Limited amino acid sequencing of N
   and its thrombin activation fragments shows 95\% identity with human and
   79\% identity with bovine FV. I-125-Factor V and a mixture of thrombin
   cleaved I-125-FV activation products were infused into normal male
   baboons and evaluated by blood sample radioactivity measurements and by
   autoradiography of plasma samples following resolution by gel
   electrophoresis. Factor V disappeared with a half-life (t(1/2)) of 12.98
   +/- 1.85 hours and was cleared without obvious degradation of the
   molecule during circulation. The radioactivity associated with the
   thrombin activated RI mixture, which consisted of the Mr = 220,000
   activation intermediate, the Mr = 150,000 activation peptide, the heavy
   chain (HC) and the light chain (LC) of FVa, was cleared in a nonlinear
   manner. The HC and LC were removed with t(1/2) < 20 minutes. The
   apparent molecular weight (Mr) = 220,000 and Mr = 150,000 fragments were
   cleared with t(1/2) > 6 hours and t(1/2) > 30 hours, respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{The isobaric thermal expansivities (alpha(p)) Of n-hexane and of methane
   measured over large pressure and temperature ranges have been proposed
   as a thermodynamic property lest for theoretical and semi-empirical
   equations of state for simple liquids at high densities. The correlation
   equations for a(p) (p, T) and the coordinates of the crossing point of
   isotherms of a(p) are given for both substances. A number of selected
   equations of state with various modifications of the attractive and
   repulsive contribution to the pressure have been tested with respect to
   their ability to reproduce the proposed test property. The analysis has
   revealed that at high densities the equations of state with modified
   repulsive term reproduce the lest property better than the equations
   with modified attractive term. A reproduction of the most characteristic
   feature of the lest property, the crossing of isotherms of a(p) can be
   only obtained with equations in which the repulsion term is made softer
   than the simple rigid-sphere term RT/(V-m-b). The best reproduction of
   the test property was obtained with the soft-sphere equation constructed
   on 8-4 Lennard-Jones intermolecular pair potential. The anisotropy in
   molecular shape of n-hexane and methane has only a little influence on
   the results of testing.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper was to improve the understanding of the
   basic mechanisms responsible for fuel formation in in situ combustion
   (ISC) and to use that understanding to identify the conditions under
   which the ISC process can be applied to improve the recovery of heavy,
   medium and light oils. Using rocks of varying mineralogical composition
   and crude oils with different contents of asphaltenes and resins,
   pyrolysis and combustion tests were performed to examine the influence
   of the thermocatalytic reactions on the amount and reactivity of fuel in
   an ISC process.
   From the results, it appears that the controlling mechanism of fuel
   formation is the conversion of crude oil components by radical
   polymerization. The conversion rate is influenced by many factors such
   as process condition and the nature of the crude oil and reservoir rock
   minerals. The formation of resins from lighter hydrocarbons and their
   polymerization into asphaltenes can be accelerated by clay minerals and
   metal components existing in the fuel formation zone. Therefore the
   importance of low temperature oxidation reactions is increasing in the
   thermocatalytic recovery process of even light and medium oils.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE Hyperinsulinaemia has a role in the development of
   hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary syndrome in women of normal
   weight. Polycystic ovaries are common in women with bulimia nervosa and
   this study aimed to determine whether women with bulimia nervosa are
   insulin resistant and to examine the relation between insulin
   sensitivity and ovarian morphology.
   DESIGN A short intravenous insulin tolerance test was used ass direct
   measure of insulin sensitivity in a group of women with bulimia nervosa
   and a control group.
   PATIENTS A series of 12 women with bulimia nervosa and normal weight was
   compared with a control group of 9 healthy women who had no clinical
   signs of eating disorder or hyperandrogenism and did not have polycystic
   ovaries.
   MEASUREMENTS Bulimic behaviour was assessed using the BITE (Bulimia
   Investigation Test, Edinburgh) questionnaire and clinical interviews.
   Ovarian morphology was assessed using transabdominal ultrasonography.
   Insulin sensitivity and serum insulin, fasting glucose, LH, FSH,
   prolactin, testosterone, androstenedione and sex hormone binding
   globulin (SHBG) were measured and compared between the two groups.
   RESULTS Ten of the 12 women with bulimia nervosa underwent ovarian
   ultrasound examination and they all had polycystic ovaries. There was no
   difference in serum LH, FSH, testosterone, androstenedione or SHBG
   concentrations between the women with bulimia nervosa and the
   non-bulimic control group. Pasting blood glucose concentrations were
   normal in all the women studied and did not differ between the women
   with bulimia nervosa and the control women. There was also no difference
   in fasting serum insulin or insulin sensitivity between the women with
   bulimia nervosa and the nonbulimic women.
   CONCLUSIONS Bulimia nervosa is not associated with insulin resistance
   and chronic hyperinsulinaemia.}},

Abstract = {{Nineteen haemodialysis (HD) patients with chronic hepatitis C were
   treated with interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha) at a dose of 3 or 1 MU
   thrice weekly for 6 months and were followed-up for another 14 months
   without treatment. Six patients discontinued treatment because they
   either presented severe side-effects to IFN-alpha or had complications
   of their primary disease. Levels of AST and ALT were within normal
   limits on the 2nd month of treatment and remained so throughout the
   treatment and the follow-up period in all patients except one who showed
   an elevation of transaminase levels 2 months after the end of treatment.
   Serum HCVRNA became negative in 10/13 patients at the end of treatment
   and was negative in all patients on the 6th month and in 12/13 patients
   on the 14th month during the follow-up period. Levels of 2'5'
   oligosynthetase were increased significantly on the 2nd and 4th month of
   treatment and returned to pretreatment values the 2nd month after
   treatment. These findings demonstrate that haemodialysis patients with
   chronic hepatitis C respond well to interferon treatment and that a
   long-term response is achieved in a high proportion of patients.}},

   production was unaffected by a flaD1(sinR) point mutation which
   represses other vegetative phase autolysins. These newly identified

   more heat resistant than those sporulated at 30 degrees C. The magnitude
   of this influence was not constant along the range of sporulation
   temperatures tested (30, 37, 44 and 52 degrees C). No statistical
   significance (P less than or equal to 0.05) differences were detected
   among z values obtained with spores sporulated at different
   temperatures. This increase of heat resistance at higher sporulation
   temperatures could account for the frequent failures of sterilization
   processes of canned vegetables, during hot seasons in warmer regions.

   mutations have been identified by physical mapping. Earlier work
   revealed that members of four disparate `'higher'' fern families all
   possess cpDNAs that share the same set of complex rearrangements in the
   inverted repeat. Osmunda cpDNA lacks these rearrangements. We have
   examined the chloroplast genomes of additional ferns and determined that
   Polypodium and the schizaeaceous ferns share the rearrangements
   previously found in Cyathea, Pteridium, Adiantum, and Polystichum. Two
   additional cpDNA structural types also have been identified. A partial
   duplication and relocation of the gene chit usually occurs with the
   other gene rearrangements found in `'higher'' ferns but may be lacking
   in the heterosporous water fern, Marsilea. Also, a structural type
   lacking any of these complex rearrangements, but still different from
   Osmunda, occurs in Gleichenia cpDNA. The phylogenetic implications of
   these findings conflict, at least in part, with previously proposed

Abstract = {{Effects of electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral phrenic nerve above
   the heart were determined on cells in the C-1-C-2 spinal cord segments
   of 27 rats anesthetized with pentobarbital. Forty-five cells that
   responded to this stimulus were included in this study. These cells then
   were examined at the same stimulus parameters for effects of stimulating
   the ipsilateral phrenic nerve below the heart, the contralateral phrenic
   nerve above the heart, and/or the left (ipsilateral) cervical vagus
   nerve. Ipsilateral phrenic nerve stimulation below the heart had no
   effect on 20 of 20 cells tested. Seven of 16 cells tested for effects of
   contralateral phrenic nerve stimulation above the heart were excited and
   activity of 9 cells was unaffected. Activity changes and activation
   latencies were not significantly different in the 7 cells excited by
   both ipsilateral and contralateral phrenic nerve stimulation.
   Thirty-seven of 45 cells excited by ipsilateral phrenic nerve
   stimulation also were excited by stimulation of the left cervical
   (ipsilateral) vagus nerve. The mean increase in cell activity was
   significantly greater following vagal nerve stimulation compared to
   phrenic nerve stimulation, and mean activation latency was significantly
   longer for vagal stimulation. Excitatory receptive somatic fields were
   classified for 35 cells. Somatic field locations for most cells (80\%)
   included the ipsilateral neck and jaw. Activity of 26 cells was
   increased by both noxious pinch and brushing the hair, activity of 6
   cells was increased only by noxious pinch, and activity of 3 cells was
   increased only by brushing the hair. Results of this study indicate that
   there are afferent fibers in the phrenic nerve above the heart, but not
   below the heart, that excite cells in the C-1-C-2 segments of the spinal
   cord. Most cells also were excited by noxious stimuli applied to their
   somatic receptive fields. Thus, the phrenic nerve may provide a pathway
   for referral of pain to the neck and jaw from thoracic structures.}},

   Most female porpoises matured at age three and became pregnant each year
   thereafter. Reproduction was strictly seasonal, with ovulation,
   conception, and parturition occurring in the spring and early summer.
   The oldest specimen in the sample was 17 yr of age, but most individuals
   were younger than 12. The findings are similar to those of earlier
   studies from the Bay of Fundy and support the hypothesis that these
   animals form a single population. Harbor porpoises represent one end of
   a continuum of odontocete life histories that spans a wide diversity of
   strategies. In comparison with other, large odontocetes, harbor
   porpoises mature at an earlier age, reproduce more frequently, and live

Abstract = {{Seventy-four species of montane breeding birds were evaluated for their
   vulnerability to extirpation in the Great Basin. Although none of these
   species are endemic to the Great Basin, the montane island system
   results in a unique pattern of species associations. Loss of species
   from these montane communities could be indicative of region-wide
   habitat degradation. I ranked susceptibility to extirpation based on
   seven biological variables: geographic range, population size,
   reproductive potential, susceptibility to cowbird parasitism, migratory
   status, and diet specialization. Each variable was weighted equally in
   its contribution to vulnerability, and scores were the sum of trait
   scores for each species. Different suites of life-history traits led to
   similar vulnerabilities. The following 10 montane bird species were
   categorized as most vulnerable to extirpation form the Great Basin,
   listed as most to east vulnerable: Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus
   borealis), Painted Redstart (Myioborus pictus), Hammond's Flycatcher
   (Empidonax hammondii), Very (Catharus fuscescens), Whip-poor-will
   (Caprimulgus vociferus), Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza lincolnii),
   Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker
   (P.tridactylus), Himalayan Snowcock (Tetraogallus himalayensis), and
   Nashville Warbler (Vermicora ruficapilla). Species of similar
   vulnerability scores often were dissimilar in threats related to their
   vulnerability: NO taxonomic patterns in vulnerability were found. This
   type of analysis should be used proactively to identify vulnerable
   species or populations and to set priorities for research and
   management.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on hippocampal long-term
   potentiation (LTP) and cellular excitability were assessed at postinjury
   days 2, 7, and 15. TBI was induced using a well-characterized central
   fluid-percussion model. LTP of the Schaffer collateral/commissural
   system was assessed in vivo in urethane-anesthetized rats. Significant
   LTP of the population excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope was
   found only in controls, and no recovery to control levels was observed
   for any postinjury time point. Four measurement parameters reflecting
   pyramidal cell discharges (population spike) indicated that TBI
   significantly increased cellular excitability, at postinjury day 2: (1)
   pretetanus baseline recording showed that TBI reduced population spike
   threshold and latency; (2) tetanic stimulation (400 Hz) increased
   population spike amplitudes to a greater degree in injured animals than
   in control animals; (3) tetanus-induced population spike latency shifts
   were greater in injured cases; and (4) tetanic stimulation elevated EPSP
   to spike ratios (E-S potentiation) to a greater degree in injured
   animals. These parameters returned to control levels, as measured on
   postinjury days 7 and 15. These results suggest that TBI induced
   excitability changes persist at least through 2 days postinjury and
   involve a differential impairment of mechanisms subserving LTP of
   synaptic efficacy and mechanisms related to action potential generation}},

Abstract = {{The influence of coherency stress, arising from differences in the
   partial molar volumes of the cations or an imposed displacement boundary
   condition, on composition profiles during kinetic demixing in ternary
   oxides subjected to a gradient in oxygen chemical potential is
   investigated. Coherency stresses can either enhance or diminish the
   magnitude of the kinetic demixing and shifts in interfacial composition
   owing to coherency stress on the order of several atomic percent,
   measured with respect to the case where stress is neglected, can be
   expected. For (Co,Mg)O subjected to displacement boundary conditions,
   steady-state and time-dependent demixing profiles are calculated and
   compared with experimental measurements, Although the composition
   profiles in the demixed solids are modified because of coherency stress,
   the main features of kinetic demixing remain unchanged.}},

Abstract = {{Storage of guava (Psidium guajava L. cv. Beaumont) at 15 degrees C
   delayed deterioration of quarter-yellow and half-yellow fruit and
   allowed gradual ripening of mature-green fruit to full color in 11 days.
   Ripening was delayed most by the lowest temperature (10 degrees C) for
   the mature-green fruit, and decreasingly less for the riper fruit and
   higher temperatures (20 degrees C). Treating fruit with 100 mu l l(-1)
   ethylene (C2H4) at 20 degrees C for 24 h resulted in a significant
   increase in the rate of skin yellowing and softening of immature-green
   fruit, whereas ethylene-treated mature-green and quarter-yellow fruit
   did not differ from non-treated control fruit in rate of skin yellowing
   and softening. Titratable acidity (TA) and total soluble solids (TSS) of
   fruit at mature-green and later stages were not significantly affected
   by ethylene treatment. Immature-green fruit, whether or not treated with
   ethylene, became `gummy' and shrivelled during ripening and had a higher

Abstract = {{Decreased immunity in depressive as compared with control subjects has
   been well documented, although some depressed patients have severe
   alterations whereas others have milder ones or not at all. Since for
   equal severities of depression, there may be individual differences in
   the degree of perceived control over one's condition, we investigated
   the interaction of perceived control with immunological variations.
   Immune function (T and B lymphocytes, lymphocyte proliferation and
   natural killer cell activity (NKCA)) were evaluated in 34 adult major
   depressives and in 18 healthy controls. Lymphocyte proliferation did not
   differ between the two groups, but NKCA was significantly lower in the
   depressed patient group. Among the depressed subjects, those who
   experienced less subjective control also showed significantly lower
   NKCA. An internal locus of control appears to act as a buffer against
   the decrease in cellular immunity observed in major depression. Further
   studies should focus on methods of coping and on degree of perceived
   control rather than on diagnostic and nosographic variables alone.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Friction blisters are a common injury in sports activities
   and military operations, Blisters can compromise performance, so it is
   important to devise preventive strategies to reduce these injuries.
   Objective: This study investigated the influence of an antiperspirant
   with emollient additives on frequency and severity of friction blisters,
   hot spots, and irritant dermatitis.
   Methods: Twenty-three healthy men walked on a treadmill (1.39 m/sec, 1\%
   grade) in a warm environment (28 degrees C, 25\% relative humidity)
   carrying a total mass of 21 +/- 1 kg. For 4 consecutive days before the
   walk, the subjects' feet were treated with either (1) an antiperspirant
   (20\% aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex glycine concentration plus
   water) with emollient additives, (2) emollient additives alone (placebo
   control), or (3) nothing (nontreated). In two separate trials (1 month
   apart) each participant received the antiperspirant treatment and both
   control treatments (emollient {[}placebo] and no treatment).
   Results: No differences were seen among treatment conditions for swear
   accumulation (p = 0.86), blister incidence (p = 0.36), hot spot
   incidence (p = 0.83), or blister severity (p = 0.31). Irritant
   dermatitis was not reported in any of the treatment conditions.
   Conclusion: The use of an antiperspirant with emollients reduces
   irritant dermatitis but does not reduce total foot-sweat accumulation,
   blister or hot spot incidence, or blister severity.}},

   states. In patients undergoing stem cell transplant procedures a rise in
   the RP\% precedes the rise in the platelet count, indicating that the
   reticulated platelets represent cells that are recently released from
   the bone marrow. The RP\% peak in patients receiving autologous

Abstract = {{Ghana is among the countries that has made most recent progress towards
   sustainable high forest management. This paper examines the role of
   `demand side' incentives-the forest fees and trade regulations which
   influence the level of demand for standing timber. The impacts of forest
   fee levels and log export bans on high-value species, are assessed
   mainly in terms of their consequences for environmental goals, but also
   with respect to revenue collection, rent distribution and economic
   objectives like the stimulation of value-added processing, exports and
   employment. By observing the impacts of forest fee levels and the log
   export ban on a range of forest stakeholders, it was found that these
   `incentives' either tended to underprice the resource and encourage rent
   seeking behaviour among the resource users, or cause a passive or
   negative attitude among `resident stakeholders', whose access to the
   resource is severely limited by law. The log export bans have caused
   severe distortions on the domestic market encouraging consumption of
   endangered species and negating the environmental objectives of the
   bans. Both the low royalties and log export ban have encouraged
   over-capacity and inefficiency in processing, to add to already high
   wastage levels in the forest. In general, these demand-side incentives
   have not prevented market forces causing high-grading of the forest, but
   have resulted in a massive transfer of resources from the public to the
   private sector, and been disappointing in terms of the expected economic
   benefits. The paper touches on the accompanying legal, institutional and
   regulatory frameworks, which also send out strong incentive signals.
   Ill-construed incentives, especially those which distort the market,
   tend to send out weak and contradictory signals. It is concluded that
   strong supply-side control measures are essential for sustainable forest
   management from state forests, while demand-side incentives may be
   viewed as fine tuning conservation measures and for their importance in
   achieving revenue and distributional objectives.}},

   both offer the potential to maintain yields for a brief period, it is
   inevitable that salinity will continue to increase and crop productivity

   latices prepared by mixing monodisperse samples could be calculated from
   the data of the monodisperse latices by use of a model by d'Haene and

   obtained by means of fiber optic quasielastic light scattering. With
   large particles short time self-diffusion was observed, but collective
   diffusion and long time self-diffusion were found in the case of small

Abstract = {{Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty has been proposed as treatment for
   unicompartmental arthritis. Overall, results have been satisfactory,
   with occasional failures of tibial component fixation. Short-term
   loosening of the femoral components in unicompartmental knee
   arthroplasty that required revision to total knee arthroplasty is
   reported. All patients presented with pain and instability of the knee,
   with loosening confirmed radiographically and at revision surgery. The
   Porous-Coated Anatomic femoral component (Howmedica, Rutherford, NJ) was
   biomechanically tested after being implanted in cadaver limbs. Cyclic
   loading in flexion and extension under physiologic loads resulted in
   implant failure. The mode of failure was rocking in the sagittal plane,
   which corresponds to the clinical findings. The femoral implant design
   consists of an angled bone-implant interface with straight arms, which
   causes shear at the bone-prosthesis interface and ultimate toggling and
   failure. A femoral component with a curved bone-implant interface did
   not loosen under identical biomechanical testing in paired knees. It was
   concluded that the Porous-Coated Anatomic femoral component has an
   unacceptably high early clinical loosening rate, confirmed by
   comparative biomechanical testing.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical role of
   bronchoscopic and nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the
   diagnosis of infectious and interstitial lung disease in children,
   BAL was performed using three 1 mL . kg(-1) aliquots of normal saline,
   with the flexible bronchoscope (Olympus 3.6 or 4.8 mm) wedged in a
   segmental or subsegmental bronchus of the lobe that showed most
   abnormality on chest radiograph. In seven children with severe diffuse
   lung disease who were intubated, a nonbronchoscopic suction catheter
   lavage was performed. Fluid cultures and cellularity were evaluated
   using identical methods for both techniques, Between January 1993 and
   April 1994, 41 BAL were performed in 32 children aged 2 months to 17 yrs
   (median 8 yrs), Of these lavages, 14 were in heart and heart-lung
   transplant recipients, 11 in children known to be immunocompromised, and
   16 in children who had a lung biopsy for interstitial lung disease or
   who had presumed infective lung disease, Transbronchial biopsies (TBB)
   or open lung biopsies were performed coincident with 19 BAL procedures,
   In all transplant recipients without clinical symptoms, BAL and TBB
   cultures were negative and BAL cellularity was normal, TBB did not
   reveal infection or rejection in any of these patients, A diagnosis of
   infection was made by BAL in 1 out of 8 transplant recipients with
   clinical symptoms, and a diagnosis of rejection was made by TBB in 3 out
   of 8 patients, In 6 out of 11 BAL in immunocompromised children, an
   infectious agent was found in the BAL fluid, In three other patients who
   had an open lung biopsy, an interstitial lung disease was diagnosed. In
   these patients, BAL was abnormal but not diagnostic,
   In summary, BAL proved helpful in the diagnosis of infective lung
   disease, but had little value in the diagnosis of rejection or
   parenchymal noninfective lung disease in children.}},

Abstract = {{Endometriosis is a reproductive disease characterized by the growth of
   endometrial cells at sites outside the uterus. This disease is a serious
   disorder associated with chronic pain and infertility, which may be
   present in 6 million women in this country. Traditional medical therapy
   has consisted of hormonal regimens that limit the action of endogenous
   estrogen. The etiology of endometriosis is unknown, but studies suggest
   that soluble factors known as cytokines play a role in disease
   pathogenesis. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin) is an
   environmental toxicant that alters the action of estrogen in
   reproductive organs and adversely affects immunocompetence. The
   incidence of endometriosis was determined in rhesus monkeys that were
   chronically exposed to dioxin for a period of approximately 4 years. Ten
   years after termination of dioxin treatment, the presence and severity
   of endometriosis was assessed by surgical laparoscopy. The incidence of
   endometriosis correlated with dioxin exposure and disease severity was
   dependent upon the dose administered. Moderate to severe endometriosis
   was not found in control animals but was documented in three of seven
   animals exposed to 5 ppt dioxin (43\%) and in five of seven animals
   exposed to 25 ppt dioxin (71\%). The frequency of spontaneous disease in
   the control group was 33\%, similar to an overall prevalence of 30\% in
   304 rhesus monkeys with no history of dioxin exposure. This study
   indicates that endometriosis may be associated with dioxin exposure in
   the rhesus. In view of overwhelming evidence that cytokines participate
   in the mediation of reproductive-endocrine phenomena regulation of
   endometrial growth, future assessment of the effects of environmental
   toxicants on reproductive health may depend upon our understanding of
   the bidirectional cytokine network between the immune and endocrine
   systems.}},

   be described as `'technical'' submissions were successful, but this does
   not mean that justice fell prey to lawyers' game-playing. On the

Abstract = {{The current industrial practice in Guatemala is to use the allowable
   mechanical property values of visually graded U.S. southern pine to
   design engineered structures because these values are not available for
   Guatemalan pines. Data on graded lumber are important because miss
   manufacturing plants in Guatemala use significant volumes of pine.
   Mechanical property values were determined by conducting bending tests
   on 8-foot- (2.44-m-) long, nominal 2- by 4-inch (38- by 89-mm) pine,
   primarily Pinus oocarpa, from two regions in Guatemala. The lumber was
   dried to 18 percent moisture content and visually graded using U.S.
   standards, Results of this study indicate that visually grading lumber
   using U.S. procedures gives an acceptable separation of property values
   among grades of Pinus oocarpa, and Guatemalan pines have greater

Abstract = {{We determined the role of the digestive gland in the respiratory
   metabolism of Penaeus setiferus adult males as a step toward proposing a
   feeding schedule based on the cycle of activity in the digestive gland.
   We measured pre- and postprandial values for oxygen consumption rate and
   hemolymph glucose concentrations in live animals, and oxygen consumption
   rate and glycogen concentration in excised digestive gland. After the
   animals were fed, which enhanced general metabolic activity, these
   indices changed. There was a high correlation between the oxygen
   consumption rate of the animal and the glucose concentration in the
   hemolymph, and between the oxygen consumption rate by the digestive
   gland and the glycogen concentration in the digestive gland, all in
   relation to time after feeding. Correlations support the hypothesis that
   the energy demand depends upon the metabolic substrate concentration. In
   this theory, glucose sustains muscle activity (during ingestion of food)
   and glycogen is the product of the digestive gland during food
   assimilation. Our observations of metabolic dynamics during the feeding
   period allowed us to examine the feeding process. The metabolic activity
   of the digestive gland was highest 6 h after feeding. This could mean
   that assimilation, having started 2 h after food intake, peaked 6 h
   after feeding. Eight hours after feeding, the oxygen consumption rate of
   the digestive gland decreased and fell to values similar to those
   recorded for animals subjected to 72 h of fasting.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To estimate the fraction of moving blood in tissue with power
   Doppler ultrasound (US).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Power Doppler US measurements of moving
   scatterers in a flow tube were made as a function of successive
   dilutions of the perfusate. Measurements were normalized relative to the
   maximum Doppler power in the center of the flow tube at the highest
   concentration and were used to calculate the fractional dilution of the
   perfusate for each run with each dilution used to represent increasing
   amounts of nonmoving soft tissue in the sample volume. The technique was
   also applied to two clinical examples.
   RESULTS: Successive dilutions of the perfusate in the flow experiment
   showed a monotonic, linear decrease in the Doppler power as a function
   of dilution.
   CONCLUSION: The power Doppler US technique has the potential to more
   accurately estimate alterations in blood flow and has the advantage of
   being a continuous parameter that can be depth normalized.}},

Title = {{EFFECTS OF FUROSEMIDE ON DISTORTION-PRODUCT OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS AND ON
   NEURONAL RESPONSES IN THE ANTEROVENTRAL COCHLEAR NUCLEUS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},

Abstract = {{1. The objective of this study was to precisely evaluate the
   relationship between the threshold of neurons in the anteroventral
   cochlear nucleus (AVCN) and the properties of distortion product
   otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Response areas of multiunit clusters in
   the AVCN and DPOAEs in the ear canal were measured alternately in the
   adult gerbil during furosemide-induced changes of the endocochlear
   potential. Stimulus frequencies of the probe tones for DPOAE measurement
   were in the range of f(1) = 1.7-7.6 kHz and f(2) = 2.0-9.0 kHz; the
   ratio f(2):f(1) was always 1.18. Stimulus amplitudes were varied in 5-dB
   steps from 30 to 80 dB SPL, with either equal amplitudes (L(1) = L(2))
   or unequal, with L(1) set 10 dB above L(2). Multiunit response areas
   were determined from cluster responses to a series of 100-ms tone bursts
   presented with a pseudorandom sequence in frequency and intensity.
   2. Changes in the multiunit discharge properties after 50-75 mg/kg
   furosemide injection were as follows: the best frequency (BF) threshold
   increased from initial values in the range of 20-30 dB SPL to 50-80 dB
   SPL at 10-20 min postinjection and then recovered fully by 60-90 min.
   The spontaneous discharge activity decreased to zero before any changes
   in the frequency threshold curve were observed and did not return to
   initial values for several hours. Likewise, total discharge rates of
   stimulus elicited responses were reduced and tended to stay reduced even
   after BF threshold had fully recovered.
   3. From the DPOAE measurements, the changes observed in the cubic
   distortion tone (CDT, 2f(1)-f(2)) emission after furosemide injection
   were as follows: at high levels of the probe tones, changes in the
   emission intensities generally stayed within a 10-dB range. The CDT
   amplitudes for low stimulus levels, however, were typically reduced by
   up to 40 dB, but recovered (depending on the furosemide dosage) by
   similar to 60-90 min.
   4. At low to moderate stimulus levels of 40-60 dB SPL, there was a near
   perfect, minute-by-minute covariation of the ear canal CDT amplitude and
   the BF threshold measured in the AVCN. A 10-dB increase in threshold was
   associated with a 5- to 7-dB decrease in the CDT emission.
   5. The optimum stimulus parameter set for the noninvasive estimation of
   cochlear performance from the CDT response was for stimulus amplitudes
   L(1) = 50, L(2) = 40 dB SPL.
   6. This experiment demonstrates that CDT emissions at low stimulus
   levels are very good predictors of the thresholds of cochlear afferents,
   but this validity is lost for BF thresholds greater than similar to
   60-70 dB SPL.
   7. The ear canal CDT amplitude is better correlated with the BF
   threshold sensitivity of neuronal response areas in the AVCN than with
   the spontaneous discharge rate or absolute above-threshold discharge
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{Optimum critical nonlifting airfoils that have the highest free stream
   Mach number M(infinity) for a given thickness ratio delta have recently
   been presented by Schwendeman, Kropinski, and Cole {[}Z. Angew. Math.
   Phys., 44 (1993), pp. 556-571]. The asymptotic shape of these airfoils
   as M(infinity) --> 1 and delta --> 0 consists of a sonic are with a
   (x(2/5)) nose. In the present paper the transonic potential flow around
   these asymptotic shapes is analyzed. Asymptotic expansions of the
   velocity potential function are constructed in terms of delta in an
   outer region around the airfoil and in an inner region near the nose.
   The outer expansion consists of the transonic small disturbance theory,
   where a leading-edge singularity appears. The inner expansion accounts
   for the flow around the nose, where a stagnation point exists. The
   matching between the expansions results in a boundary value problem in
   the inner region for the solution of a uniform sonic flow about a
   two-dimensional (x(2/5)) surface. The numerical solution of the inner
   flow results in the pressure distribution on the nose. Finally, a
   uniformly valid pressure distribution over the entire airfoil surface is
   derived.}},

Abstract = {{The study objectives were to determine the impact of a nationwide
   educational campaign on the incidence of foreign body aspiration (FBA)
   in Israeli children. Impressed by the alarming number of FBAs, we
   conducted an educational campaign through the media during 1982-1983.
   The campaign included television and radio broadcasts, newspaper
   articles and interviews, and medical educational programmes in community
   paediatric care centres. Questionnaires were sent to all Departments of
   Paediatrics in Israel. Results showed a reduction in the incidence of
   FBA by 35\% in 1983 as compared to 1981. Re-evaluation studies conducted
   in 1992 showed no further reduction of FBA.
   Conclusion Continuous and extensive educational programmes should be
   undertaken by the health authorities if FBA is to be prevented.
   Furthermore, it is important to legislate mandatory labelling of seed
   and nut containers with the warning that the intake of seeds is
   dangerous to children under 5 years of age.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of changes in gene expression induced by 60 Hz magnetic fields
   has been considered to support an association between exposure to
   magnetic fields and cancer risk. Several reports have indicated that
   these fields rapidly activate many genes in mammalian cells. However,
   previous studies in this area have not provided sufficient information
   to support the conclusions drawn. To clarify this controversial
   research, we have attempted to validate, under rigorously controlled
   conditions, key experiments on induction of gene expression by magnetic
   fields. An extensive series of experiments, incorporating critical
   improvements in experimental design, most notably blind exposures and
   internal standards, was performed with human HL60 and Daudi cells.
   Exposure conditions covered a range of flux densities (5.7 mu T to 10
   mT) and times (20-60 min). No alteration in the human MYC gene, commonly
   referred to as c-myc, or beta-actin steady-state mRNA levels was
   observed. The lack of an effect was not attributable to exposure
   geometry, timing of RNA preparation, or serum lot and concentration. To
   eliminate any remaining variables, exact replication was performed in
   one of the laboratories previously reporting gene expression effects;
   again, no evidence for altered MYC expression was found. Finally,
   differential display PCR indicated that extremely low-frequency magnetic
   field-induced changes in gene expression were not prevalent. (C) 1995 by

Abstract = {{Surface rigidities of emulsion particles composed of triglyceride (TG)
   and phosphatidylcholine (PC), and PC vesicles were investigated using
   the fluorescent probe
   1-{[}4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene (TMA-DPH), which
   was anchored at the phospholipid-water interface. Steady-state
   fluorescence anisotropy of TMA-DPH in surface monolayers of emulsion
   particles was higher than that in bilayers of vesicles. A longer
   fluorescence lifetime of TMA-DPH in emulsion surface monolayers was
   observed compared to bilayers. These results indicated that the surface
   monolayers of emulsion particles were more rigid than bilayers,
   consistent with the finding that the PC molecules formed a condensed
   monolayer at the TG-saline interface (Handa, T.; Saito, H.; Miyajima, K.
   Biochemistry 1990, 29, 2884-2890). Distribution of cholesterol (Chol)
   between the emulsion surface and core was evaluated on the basis of
   interfacial tension measurements. The anisotropy value in the emulsion
   particles did not change up to 20 mol \% and began to increase at about
   30 mol \% or greater of surface Chol, in contrast to continuous
   increases in the fluorescence anisotropy in bilayer vesicles. When an
   approximately 20 mol \% of Chol was present in surface layers, the
   fluorescence lifetimes of TMA-DPH increased for bilayer vesicles but did
   not change for emulsion particles. Fluorescence lifetimes increased for
   both emulsion particles and bilayer vesicles with 40 mol \% of surface
   Chol. These effects of Chol on the fluorescence properties of emulsion
   particles and bilayers suggested that Chol was accommodated in a
   different way for the surface monolayers of emulsion particles and
   bilayers of vesicles.}},

Abstract = {{Tenascin-C, a six-armed extracellular matrix glycoprotein, is expressed
   in a temporally and spatially restricted pattern during carcinogenesis
   and invasion or metastasis of carcinoma cells in association with
   stromal-epithelial interactions. The human epidermoid carcinoma-derived
   cell lines, A431 and HEp-2, which do not express tenascin-C by
   themselves in vitro, do express tenascin-C after transplantation into
   nude mice, and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TCF-beta 1) induces
   them to express tenascin-C in vitro. Epidermal growth factor(EGF)
   induced tenascin-C in these cells more effectively (about 3.5-fold
   greater) than did TGF-beta 1 Hepatocyte growth factor (HCF) and
   platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) had little effect on the induction
   of tenascin-C. EGF also induced other extracellular matrix components,
   fibronectin and laminin. Tenascin-C was also induced when the carcinoma
   cells were co-cultured with embryonic fibroblasts from mice which were
   homozygous for a null mutation in the tenascin-C gene, or when the
   conditioned medium from these cells was added. The induction of
   tenascin-C in the co-culture was reduced by treating the cells with
   antibodies against EGF or its receptor. The addition of EGF caused both
   cell types to disrupt their cytoskeleton and focal contacts as evidenced
   by the loss of stress fibers and vinculin plaques. EGF did neither
   induce tenascin-C nor affect the morphology in tenascin-C-nonproducing
   A549 carcinoma cells, which did not produce tenascin-C after
   transplantation. Thus, EGF induces tenascin-C in tenascin-C-nonproducing
   human carcinoma cells through EGF receptors. Furthermore, in
   stromal-epithelial interactions, the diffusible factor EGF participates
   in the induction of human tenascin-C in these cells through EGF
   receptors. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Kawasaki disease, which is characterized by systemic vasculitis causing
   coronary arterial involvement in childhood, shows a variety of
   immunoregulatory abnormalities. Especially the direct or indirect
   deleterious effects on endothelial cells of cytokines and
   anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) are considered to be involved in
   the mechanism responsible for production of vasculitis. Intravenous
   administration of high doses of gamma-globulin (IVGG) has been used as
   an effective therapy for Kawasaki disease. To examine the behavior of
   endothelial cells affected by cytokines and IVGG in Kawasaki disease, we
   studied the effects of interferon (IFN), IL-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha on the migration of human umbilical vein
   endothelial cell line (tHUEO1) by a modified Boyden chamber method.
   Plasma from patients with acute Kawasaki disease markedly enhanced the
   migration of tHUE01 cells. Cytokines, with the exception of TNF-cr, also
   enhanced the migration of tHUEO1 cells in a dose-dependent manner.
   Anti-IFN antibody inhibited the migratory activity in response to not
   only IFN-gamma but also to the plasma from patients with Kawasaki
   disease. Rabbit AECA (rAECA) also significantly stimulated the migration
   of tHUEO1 cells. Plasma from patients treated with IVGG did not affect
   the migration of tHUEO1 cells. Addition of y-globuIin significantly
   inhibited the migration of tHUEO1 cells induced by the cytokines or
   rAECA. These results suggest that cytokines and AECA are important in
   restructuring and destroying vessel walls in Kawasaki disease by
   enhancing the migration of endothelial cells, and that IVGG may be
   therapeutically effective for this disease by suppressing this
   endotheliaI cell migration.}},

Abstract = {{An ultraviolet atlas of the solar spectrum with a spectral resolution of
   15 m Angstrom in the region 1948-2000 Angstrom is presented. It is the
   first part of the spectra recorded on the quiet Sun between 1900 and
   2130 Angstrom. Measurements were performed from a balloon-borne
   instrumentation flown at an altitude of 39 km. The wavelength atlas with
   a list of about 550 lines has been synthesized from data at center of
   the Sun (mu = 1) and at mu = 0.89, smoothed out over an area of 30
   arcsec. The wavelength scale is given with respect to the average solar
   spectrum. Tracings are presented at mu = 0.89, with an intensity scale
   adjusted in absolute values on the level of the continuum near 2000

Abstract = {{Data from recent studies suggest that donor fasting imparts a beneficial
   effect on the viability of transplanted hepatic allografts. Because
   starvation may temporarily inactivate Kupffer cells, and because these
   cells are the likely mediators of liver injury after prolonged
   preservation-reperfusion, the purpose of this study is to establish a
   link between improved organ viability and Kupffer cell inactivation
   caused by donor allograft fasting. In an in vivo rat liver transplant
   model, 48 hours of donor fasting (1) improved allograft viability, (2)
   significantly decreased Kupffer cell phagocytosis, and (3) significantly
   decreased cytokine (tumor necrosis factor {[}TNF]) production
   postrevascularization. These data validate work from previous studies
   demonstrating that donor fasting improves allograft viability and
   furthermore support our previous research implicating activation of
   Kupffer cells as a causative agent of cold ischemia-preservation injury.}},

Abstract = {{{[}C-14] Menaquinone-4 was administered orally once daily at a dose of 4
   mg/kg for ten days to female rats of different ages to determine its
   blood and tissue distribution with particular attention to its
   distribution in bone. Animals aged 10 and 30 months were either
   ovariectomized or sham-operated as a control, and young rats aged 7
   weeks were used as untreated controls. Blood concentrations of
   radioactivity at 24 h after each dose during repeated administration
   increased daily and approached a steady state by the seventh dose.
   Higher concentrations of radioactivity in blood (plasma) were observed
   in older animals than in the younger ones, but there was little
   difference between ovariectomized rats (OVX rats) and sham-operated rats
   (Sham rats). In tissue samples collected at 1.5 h after administration,
   the liver, adipose tissue, spleen and adrenals showed higher
   concentrations of radioactivity than the other organs and the plasma. In
   bone tissues, the bone marrow (BM) and cancellous tissue (CT) of the
   femur showed radioactivity concentrations which were higher than that in
   the plasma, and these increased during repeated administration. Finally,
   at 24 h after the last dose, the concentrations of radioactivity in bone
   tissues of older animals (BM, 5,807.2 ng eq/g; CT, 5,264.8 ng eq/g in
   OVX rats aged 10 months and BM, 11,479.3 ng eq/g; CT, 4,023.0 ng eq/g in
   OVX rats aged 30 months) were several times higher than those in younger
   animals (BM, 2,771.6 ng eq/g; CT, 890.2 ng eq/g in 7-week-old untreated
   rats). The values in OVX rats were also higher than those in Sham rats.
   Furthermore, micro autoradiography studies of femur sections from OVX
   rats indicated that {[}C-14]Menaquinone-4 localized in cancellous tissue
   where bone is known to be actively remodelled. The concentrations of
   radioactivity in cancellous tissue and bone marrow of OVX rats aged 10
   and 30 months were comparable to the pharmacologically effective
   concentrations of Menaquinone-4 (10(-6)-10(-5) M) in in vitro studies on
   bone formation. These findings suggest that orally administered
   Menaquinone-4 distributes specifically into the bone tissues of
   ovariectomized rats and this is consistent with its effect as a
   therapeutic agent for osteoporosis.}},

Abstract = {{We report the Brownian dynamics simulation results on the translational
   and bond-angle-orientational correlations for charged colloidal binary
   suspensions as the interparticle interactions are increased to form a
   crystalline (for a volume fraction phi = 0.2) or a glassy (phi = 0.3)
   state. The translational order is quantified in terms of the two- and
   four-point density autocorrelation functions whose comparisons show that
   there is no growing correlation length near the glass transition. The
   nearest-neighbor orientational order is determined in terms of the
   quadratic rotational invariant Q(l) and the bond-orientational
   correlation functions g(l)(t). The l dependence of Q(l) indicates that
   icosahedral (l = 6) order predominates at the cost of the cubic order (l
   = 4) near the glass as well as the crystal transition. The density and
   orientational correlation functions for a supercooled liquid freezing
   towards a glass fit well to the streched-exponential form
   exp{[}-(t/tau)(beta)]. The average relaxation times extracted from the
   fitted stretched-exponential functions as a function of effective

Abstract = {{Background. At least two different evolutional pathways of colorectal
   cancer, namely the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and de novo
   carcinogenesis, have been indicated. However, whether there is a
   difference between them in affected chromosomes and genes has not yet
   been elucidated. Chromosomal examination is expected to provide a clue
   to an answer to this question. In this study, the relation of
   aberrations in chromosome 18 to type of colorectal cancer was examined.
   Methods. Numeric aberrations in chromosome 18 were investigated in 71
   colorectal tumors by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization, using
   an alphoid satellite DNA probe specific for the pericentromeric region
   on chromosome 18.
   Results. The loss of one chromosome 18 was found in 33\% (6 of 18) of
   patients with early cancer, excluding those with cancer in an adenoma.
   The loss was frequent in early colorectal carcinomas without foci of
   adenoma (four of six patients, 67\%), whereas monosomy 18 was not
   significant in those with foci of adenoma except for patients with a
   hereditary background. Specimens exhibiting monosomy 18 were
   macroscopically classified as hat lesions, but the converse was not
   true. No adenoma showed monosomy 18. It was encountered in 44\% of nine
   cancers with invasion to the muscularis propria. However, no significant
   subpopulation of monosomy 18 was present in cancers penetrating through
   the serosa or adventitia in which polysomic populations were often
   identified alternatively. Furthermore, tetrasomy for this chromosome was
   exclusive in these advanced cancers.
   Conclusions. The loss of chromosome 18 is closely related to colorectal

Abstract = {{The characterization of images containing fatigue manifestations often
   implies the detection and quantification of thin and elongated objects
   such as fatigue striations, slip bands and micro cracks. In this paper,
   we propose a classification of these images in three categories: (1)
   fractured surface imaging, (2) damaged surface imaging, and (3) deformed
   surface imaging. Each category has a preferential mode of acquisition
   (electronic, optical microscope or laser scanner), and a particular
   processing (conventional matrix processing, directional filter via
   Fourier transform, Haralick's segmentation process, shape
   classification). The accuracy and reliability of the algorithms
   presenting a novelty will be further discussed. The objectives are to
   measure the orientation and spacing between striations on fractured
   surfaces, to evaluate the relative surface of slip bands on damaged
   surfaces, and to assess the shape and size of a crack tip plastic zone
   qualitatively via deformed surface imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To test the efficacy of a specially-formulated,
   carbohydrate-rich beverage (one known to increase the serum ratio of
   tryptophan to other large neutral amino acids) on the mood, cognitive,
   and appetitive disturbances of premenstrual syndrome (FMS).
   Methods: Twenty-four women with confirmed PMS were enrolled in a
   double-blind, crossover study to test the efficacy of the
   specially-formulated beverage compared with two other isocaloric
   products on PMS symptoms. The study was conducted over three menstrual
   cycles preceded by a 1-month placebo run-in. Patients were tested at
   home or work using an interactive computer-telephone system.
   Standardized measurements of mood, cognitive performance, and food
   cravings were made before and 30, 90, and 180 minutes after consumption
   of active and placebo beverages during the late luteal phase of the
   menstrual cycle.
   Results: The experimental carbohydrate intervention significantly
   decreased self-reported depression, anger, confusion, and carbohydrate
   craving 90-180 minutes after intake. Memory word recognition was also
   improved significantly compared with scores obtained during the placebo
   run-in month (P < .05). The isocaloric placebo interventions had no
   significant effect on any of these measures.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that the psychological and appetitive
   symptoms of PMS can be relieved after consuming a specially-formulated,
   carbohydrate-rich beverage known to increase serum tryptophan levels.}},

   as sociodemographic background factors. One hundred fifty-jive married
   couples were selected by a random area sample from the state of Iowa.
   Husbands and wives were interviewed separately in the home. The results
   partially support the HEM as applied to a nutrition domain and revealed
   interesting gender differences. For wives the cost of healthy diet
   changes had an effect on pCF. For husbands, perceived threat and
   self-efficacy had an effect on PCF The differences are discussed on the

Abstract = {{We present speckle masking observations of R 64 (= HD 32228; O9.5II: +
   WC5), the central object of the OB association LH9 in the Large
   Magellanic Cloud. Two sets of speckle interferograms were taken to
   select the Johnson V spectral band and the strong Wolf-Rayet emission
   lines between 450 and 490 nm. In the 6''.4 x 6''.4 field of view 25
   stellar components were detected in R 64 with V magnitudes in the range
   12.5 to 17.1 and down to a resolution of 0''.12. The brightest star in
   the visual component B is the only Wolf-Rayet star in R 64. The
   colour-magnitude diagram of LH9, completed with the components of R 64,
   serves for the discussion of the evolutionary state of the association.
   There is evidence that the outer regions of LH9 are its youngest parts
   with an upper age of about 5 Myr, in accordance with estimates by
   Walborn \& Parker (1992). The WC5 star in the centre is most likely the
   product of mass exchange in a massive close binary system with an age in
   excess of 5 Myr. The mass density in R 64 is about 250 M.pc(-3) for
   stars more massive than 5 M..}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C virus (HCV) requires reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR) or branched DNA signal amplification assays to be
   detected in patient samples. Although conventional methods of RNA
   isolation are employed for samples of serum, plasma, and peripheral
   blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), whole blood is generally considered an
   unsuitable source of RNA because of abundant RNases and polymerase
   inhibitors. Using a cationic surfactant, Catrimox-14, we adapted a
   procedure for RNA isolation from whole blood, plasma, and PBMCs that
   yields RNA template suitable for HCV RT-PCR. RNA isolation required less
   than 2 hr, and HCV sequences were easily detected in sample volumes of
   50 mu l whole blood or plasma, and in less than 1 x 10(4) PBMC.
   Following the addition of blood to Catrimox, HCV RNA was stable in the
   mixture when incubated for at least 7 days at room temperature prior to
   RNA extraction. Comparison of whole blood HCV RNA and plasma HCV RNA
   from individuals with chronic hepatitis suggests that HCV RNA can be
   more reliably detected in whole blood. Three of 15 HCV antibody positive
   patients (20\%) had HCV RNA present in whole blood but simultaneously
   obtained plasma samples were negative. Two of five HCV antibody negative
   individuals with chronic hepatitis contained HCV RNA in whole blood, yet
   one of these patient's plasma was negative for viral RNA. The
   Catrimox-14 method of RNA purification is useful for detecting HCV RNA
   in whole blood and blood subfractions, and provides a practical method
   of measuring plasma and PBMC HCV RNA from clinical specimens. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{In order to improve the film-forming properties of polyether-based
   polymer electrolytes a new family of materials was synthesized. The
   structures described in this work involve a cellulosic ether backbone on
   which oligoethers were grafted and crosslinked in various proportions
   via urethane chemistry and to which lithium perchlorate was subsequently
   added as a source of ionic species. The resulting networks were fully
   characterized in terms of glass transition temperature, dynamic
   mechanical properties and ionic conductivity. With respect to the
   optimized polyether-based networks studied previously, the introduction
   of polysaccharide chains does not alter the basic features neither
   qualitatively nor quantitatively.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional radiotherapy planning (3-D RTP) is becoming more
   available in clinical practice, although so far there is little data
   showing its clinical advantage. The goal of this study was to compare
   3-D RTP and dose delivery with conventional treatment planning in
   pneumonected lung cancer patients, receiving postoperative irradiation.
   Adjuvant radiotherapy in 20 pneumonected patients was planned with a 3-D
   system and patients were irradiated according to this plan. The
   resulting dose distribution was compared with the combination of a
   simulator and 2-D planned treatment to the same target volume. Dose
   volume histograms of the target, the lung and the heart of both
   treatment plans were analysed. A biophysical model was added to estimate
   the differences in the biological effect. 3-D RTP significantly reduced
   the mean dose to the lung in 14/20 patients and to the heart in 20/20
   patients. The mean dose delivered to the target was equal in both
   planning methods. The early clinical results do not differ from
   published results in postoperatively treated lung cancer patients.}},

   differences in structure that can also be quantified by appropriately

   and an index for relative segment orientation show clear dependencies on
   the optimization target, and the nature of changes call be explained on

Abstract = {{Disrupted smooth pursuit eye tracking characterizes a greater proportion
   of individuals with schizophrenia than in the normal population. The
   finding of a similar increased incidence of eye tracking abnormality in
   first degree relatives of schizophrenics implicates this disorder as a
   potential biological marker for schizophrenia. To test the assumption
   that the eye tracking dysfunction of schizophrenics is genetically
   related, left and right smooth pursuit gain and phase shift were
   compared between 20 schizophrenics with a family history of
   schizophrenia or schizophrenia-related disorders, 18 schizophrenics
   without a family history, as well as for 18 normal controls. Subjects
   tracked pendular targets on an LED light bar moving at frequencies of
   0.2 and 0.7 Hz. Horizontal eye movements were recorded using
   DC-electro-oculography. Results indicate that schizophrenics with a
   positive family history had significantly reduced right pursuit gain
   compared with controls, while right gain for negative family history
   schizophrenics did not differ from either group. Schizophrenic subjects
   also were administered neuropsychological tests. Linear regression by
   groups analyses reveal that neuropsychological measures significantly
   predicted right gain to slower targets (0.2 Hz) for the positive family
   history schizophrenics, but not for negative family history

Abstract = {{The gene arfB encoding alpha-L-arabino-furanosidase B of the
   cellulolytic thermophile Clostridium stercorarium was expressed in
   Escherichia coli from a 2.2-kb EcoRI DNA fragment. The recombinant gene

   has a tetrameric structure with a monomeric relative molecular mass of
   52 00. The optima for temperature and pH are 70 degrees C and 5.0
   respectively. The enzyme appears to have no metal cofactor requirement
   and is sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents. It hydrolyzes aryl and alkyl
   alpha-L-arabinofuranosides and cleaves arabinosyl side-chains from
   arabinoxylan (oat-spelt xylan) and from xylooligosaccharides produced by
   recombinant endoxylanase XynA from the same organism. The identity of
   the N-terminal amino acid sequences indicates that ArfB corresponds to

Abstract = {{The long-term fate of four polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD)
   congeners in sediments and their bioavailability to benthic
   invertebrates were studied in littoral enclosures located in a small
   lake at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario. The PCDDs
   sorbed on sediment particles were added to the 5-m-diameter enclosures
   on June 12, 1985, and concentrations in sediment cores (0 to 6 cm) were
   determined over 1,800-d (similar to 5 years). Concentrations of
   1,3,6,8-TCDD, 1,3,7,9-TCDD, HpCDD, and OCDD in the sediment declined,
   with half-lives of 4.4+/-1.7, 4.6+/-1.9, 6.2+/-3.1, and 6.0+/-2.8 year,
   respectively. Evaluation of the data for 1,3,6,8-TCDD and OCDD using a
   sediment-water exchange model suggested that the decline in PCDD
   concentrations was due to losses to the water column via diffusion of
   DOG-associated PCDDs in pore water and via particle resuspension. After
   5 years the PCDDs remained bioavailable to freshwater mussel (Anodonta
   grandis) and crayfish (Orconectes virilis) exposed to sediments for up
   to 78 d. The crayfish had higher mean biota-sediment accumulation
   factors (BSAFs) for 1,3,6,8-TCDD and 1,3,7,9-TCDD (0.31-0.53) than did
   mussels (0.07-0.13), whereas BSAFs for HpCDD and OCDD in the two species
   were similar (0.03-0.09).}},

Journal = {{LABORATORY INVESTIGATION}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{558-564}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis, storage,
   secretion, or degradation of intestinal mucins are still unclear. Little
   is known about the carbohydrate composition of mucins in response to
   changes in the intestinal lumen, so lectin histochemical techniques were
   used to study the alterations in glycoconjugate synthesis of mucins in
   rats under different diets and microfloras.
   EXPERIMENTAL; DESIGN: Nine-week-old germ-free and conventional rats were
   given either a purified diet of finely powdered ingredients, including
   cellulose as a source of fiber, or a more coarsely ground commercial
   diet of natural ingredients containing crude fiber of cereal origin. To
   mimic the human situation more closely, a group of rats born germ-free,
   inoculated with a suspension of human feces, and fed a purified diet
   were used as an experimental model.
   RESULTS: In rats fed a commercial diet, the surface goblet cells in the
   small intestine were more intensely labeled with N-acetyl-glucosamine
   and sialic acid-linked D-galactose-specific lectins than in rats fed the
   purified diet. A similar increased staining with a
   N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin was observed in the large
   intestine of rats fed a commercial diet. The microbial nora modified the
   crypt-surface glycosylation of fucosyl and sialic acid residues in the
   large intestine. The human flora specifically altered the goblet cell
   glycoconjugates in the surface epithelium.
   CONCLUSIONS: The significant changes in goblet cell glycoconjugates
   reflect the adaptation of the intestinal mucosa to different diets and
   microbial populations. An overall reduction in sialic acid-linked
   D-galactose residues in conventional rats and a loss of crypt-to-surface
   gradient of fucosyl expression in the large intestine of human flora
   rats are likely to be due to differing strains of glycosidases in the
   two microfora.}},

   taller plants with greater circumferences in orchardgrass, and shorter,

Abstract = {{Cellular mechanisms for regulating membrane movements appear to involve
   small GTPases of the Rab subfamily. Binding of GDP-bound Rab proteins to
   donor membranes and their release from target membranes appear to be
   regulated by GDP-dissociation inhibitor (GDI) protein isoforms. Previous
   work showed strikingly higher Levels of GDI-2 than GDI-1 fractionate
   with total membranes of cultured cells and are visualized in the
   perinuclear region in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Here we report that
   GDI-2-containing structural elements are concentrated predominantly in
   the pericentriolar area in interphase CHO-T cells and differentiated
   3T3-L1 adipocytes based on colocalization of GDI-2 and the centrosomal
   marker pericentrin. This finding is documented by both
   immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Expressed c-Myc-tagged
   GDI-2 in transfected COS-7 cells targets to the same region. During
   mitotic resolution of the centrosome into two identifiable foci in CHO-T
   cells, GDI-2 containing structures remain intact and also resolve into
   two regions surrounding the centrosome. Dissociation of pericentriolar
   GDI-2 from the Golgi markers P-COP and lectin receptors was apparent
   upon brefeldin A treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes or CHO-T cells. The
   integrity of pericentriolar GDI-2-binding elements was not disrupted by
   either brief Triton X-100 extraction or microtubule cytoskeletal
   disassembly, achieved with nocodazole. These data demonstrate the
   presence of highly ordered, detergent-resistant GDI-2-specific
   structural elements around the centrosome and indicate functional
   differences for the GDI-1 and GDI-2 protein isoforms. The results
   suggest the presence of selective GDI-2 accepters in this region and a
   possible role of pericentriolar GDI-2 in membrane recycling.}},

Abstract = {{Activation of areas of the healthy hemisphere seems to play a role in
   functional recovery from stroke. We studied cerebral blood flow changes
   during motor and mental activity in patients with cortical ischemic
   lesions. We simultaneously measured blood flow velocity in the two
   middle cerebral arteries of 45 patients with single cortical ischemic
   lesions and good functional recovery and of 16 healthy controls by means
   of bilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasonography during a a-minute
   sequential thumb-to-finger opposition task, alternately performed with
   the right and left hands, and during a 1-minute word-fluency task.
   Twenty-five patients had left cortical lesions, 12 with previous motor
   deficit alone and 13 with associated motor deficit and Broca's aphasia.
   Twenty patients had right cortical lesions with previous motor deficit.
   With respect to baseline values, the increase of flow velocity in the
   middle cerebral artery contralateral to the hand performing the motor
   task was comparable in controls and patients, regardless of the side of
   the lesion and the hand (normal or recovered) involved in the task.
   During movement of the recovered hand, the increase of flow velocity in
   the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery was significantly greater (p <
   0.001, two-way ANOVA) than the increase during movement of the normal
   hand in both controls and patients. During performance of the
   word-fluency task, the increase of flow velocity in the left middle
   cerebral artery was comparable in controls and patients. In patients
   with left lesions and previous aphasia, the increase of flow velocity in
   the right middle cerebral artery was significantly higher than in
   controls (p = 0.02, one-way ANOVA), patients with right cortical lesions
   (p = 0.01), and patients with left lesions but no previous aphasic
   problem (p = 0.001). These data suggest a contribution of the undamaged
   hemisphere to the functional recovery of patients with cortical ischemic

   homeotic genes. Although it is classified in the Polycomb group (PcG) on
   the basis of phenotypic criteria, it is distinct from most other PcG
   repressors in its time of action during development. We describe the
   temporal profile of esc mRNA expression during embryogenesis and the
   stage-specific rescue of esc mutants with a heat shock-inducible ese
   cDNA transformation construct. Both experiments support the idea that
   ese product plays an early, transient role in repression of homeotic
   genes. We also present the sequence of a full-length ese cDNA. The
   predicted esc protein is composed primarily of multiple copies of a
   repeat motif, termed the WD40 repeat, which are likely used in
   protein-protein contact. We provide evidence that individual copies of
   the esc WD40 repeats are needed for function in vivo. We suggest that
   esc protein is an adaptor that binds to multiple protein partners and
   assists in the assembly or targeting of other PcG proteins.}},

   guide the synthesis of new disulfonic stilbene derivatives.
   Computational chemical methods were used to deduce the important
   features of the disulfonic stilbene molecule necessary for potent
   blockade of ORCC and ultimately led to the discovery of the calixarenes.

Abstract = {{The kinetics of paraprotein clearance after autografting for multiple
   myeloma have not been described. We studied 33 myeloma patients in
   plateau phase with detectable paraprotein (3-34 g/l, median 10 g/l) at
   the time of ABMT who received melphalan (200 mg/m(2) and
   methylprednisolone (1.5 g x 5) for conditioning. Fifteen patients
   received interferon-alpha post-transplant as part of a randomized study.
   Twenty-four of 33 (72.7\%) patients eventually cleared the paraprotein
   at a median of 47 days (range 5-783) post-transplant. The probability of
   clearance was lower (46.7 vs 94.4\%, P = 0.004) and the time taken to
   clear paraprotein longer (142 vs 29 days, P = 0.003) in patients with a
   higher level (>10 g/l) at the time of the transplant. However, clearance
   occurred within 6 months in 23 of 24 (95.8\%) patients who ultimately
   cleared the paraprotein. Interferon-alpha did not influence the
   clearance of paraprotein. We conclude that after autografting for
   myeloma, the time taken to clear paraprotein is longer and the
   probability of clearance lower with higher levels at the time of ABMT,
   and most patients who eventually clear the paraprotein do so within 6
   months. Because the probability of clearing paraprotein (and thus
   attaining remission) in patients with detectable paraprotein 6 months
   post-transplant is low, a decision about further treatment may be made
   at this point.}},

Abstract = {{Between March 1986 and March 1994, the seroconversion to HBV associated
   to the seroconversion to HIV was investigated in 120 HIV seroconverters
   drawn from 2368 i.v. drug misusers screened for HIV, HBV and STDs. Among
   the 185 individuals susceptible to HIV and HBV at intake (41/120 HIV
   seroconverters and 144/364 HIV-negative controls), HBV seroconversion
   was associated with the seroconversion to HIV (p = 0.006) and history of
   more than 3 sexual partners per year (p = 0.000). Only the history of
   more than 3 partners per year remained associated with the HBV
   seroconversion in the conditional regression. The associated
   seroconversion to HIV and HBV was linked to the short period of i.v.
   drug injections (p = 0.032), history of more than 3 partners per year (p
   = 0.000) and more than 3 i.v. drug injections per day (p = 0.016).
   Compared to the seroconverters to HBV alone, the seroconverters to HBV
   and HIV were likely to have higher frequency of i.v. drug injection per
   day on univariate (p = 0.031) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.024). The
   seroconverters to both the viruses differed from the seroconverters to

   high frequency of injection per day (p = 0.033). Higher risk of HIV

Abstract = {{Kinetic and fluid treatments of nonlinear wave interactions (wave mixing
   and electromagnetic wave scattering) in plasmas are considered and the
   difference between the two approaches is discussed. Solving the kinetic
   equation by the method of moments makes it possible to substantiate the
   validity and find the applicability range of the fluid approach to the
   study of nonlinear plasma processes. In particular, the detailed study
   of nonlinear processes in a plasma with external magnetic fields is
   performed. In the case of wave transformation, when mixed waves satisfy
   linear wave equations, both fluid and kinetic approaches yield similar
   expressions for the inducing current. In the case of electromagnetic
   wave scattering by thermal fluctuations, the results of the fluid and
   kinetic approaches are in accordance only in the limiting case of cold
   plasmas when thermal effects may be completely disregarded (these are
   thermal corrections to the wave dispersion equation and the additional
   Langevin source in the constitutive equation for fluctuations).
   Different expressions for the inducing current, obtained from various
   versions of hydrodynamic equations, reduce to the same form in the cold
   plasma limiting case.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses experimental methods to analyze Ricardian equivalence
   when the probability of debt retirement is less than one. The results
   suggest that the presence of outstanding debt and the probability of
   debt retirement have a strong influence on savings behavior. When the
   probability of debt retirement is low, consumption by the current
   generation increases, as predicted by Keynesian theory. However, as the
   probability of debt retirement increases, bequests rise to offset the
   future generation's expected repayment liability, and deficit spending
   becomes much less expansionary, as predicted by Ricardian theory. In
   general, the average bequest is significantly larger when an outstanding
   debt is passed on to the next generation than when no debt exists,
   regardless of the probability of debt retirement. However, as long as
   there is some uncertainty about debt repayment, the presence of debt
   always stimulates some additional consumption, so that strong variants
   of Ricardian equivalence are not found.}},

Abstract = {{Thermomechanical stresses are built up in the plastic packages during
   the manufacture of an integrated device and also throughout the working
   life of the device, arising due to a mismatch between the coefficients
   of thermal expansion of the package materials. Excessive levels of
   thermomechanically induced stresses may lead to cracking in the
   packages, which could in turn lead to failure of the device.
   It is important, therefore, to be able to predict and measure
   thermomechanical stresses in order to improve package reliability. This
   paper describes the use of finite-element techniques and strain gauges
   to determine package stress levels. The effect of delaminations at the
   interfaces of the package materials is discussed also, and the scanning
   acoustic microscope is introduced as a complimentary tool to identify
   stress-related defects in plastic packages.}},

   experiments was to determine the Mach number, flow angularity and total
   pressure distribution in the core region of supersonic wing tip
   vortices. A secondary aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of
   calibrating a conical probe using a computational solution to predict
   the flow characteristics. Results of the present investigation showed
   that the numerically generated calibration data can be used for pointed
   nose four-hole conical probes but were not sufficiently accurate for
   conventional five-hole probes due to nose bluntness effects. A
   combination of four-hole conical probe measurements with independent
   pitot pressure measurements indicated a significant Mach number and
   total pressure deficit in the core regions of supersonic wing tip
   vortices, combined with an asymmetric `'Burger-like'' swirl

   Previous findings of the elevated suggestibility of this group were
   confirmed. Contrary to predictions, confabulation was not associated
   with self-esteem, or compliance. Confabulation was found to be related
   to rate of forgetting, and higher levels of suggestibility and anxiety.
   Interestingly, the components of confabulation, fabrications and
   distortions,did not correlate significantly with each other:
   fabrications and distortions were each associated with different

Abstract = {{Lectin histochemistry was used to analyze the ocular surface basement

   Soybean agglutinin (SBA), a lectin marker for N-acetylgaractosamine
   residues, recognized a 130 kDa glycoconjugate in corneal but not
   conjunctival basement membrane. Following corneal epithelial cell
   wounding in vitro, the glycoconjugate was not expressed at the
   epithelial cell-stromal interface until 72-96 h in culture, much later
   than the expression of other basement membrane molecules. In epithelial
   cells maintained on various extracellular matrix substrates (laminin,
   collagen type IV, or a mixture of laminin, collagen type IV and heparan
   sulfate proteoglycan), the glycoconjugate localization patterns changed
   with time in culture from a diffuse cellular or perinuclear ring to an
   extensive extracellular filament network. The presence of SBA in the
   culture medium did not affect migration or adhesion in either the wound
   healing model or in cultured cells. However, the presence of SBA did
   delay the deposition of laminin at the zone of basement membrane
   reformation in the wound healing model. The 130 kDa glycoconjugate is a
   candidate for molecules which impart a tissue-specificity to the corneal
   basement membrane, and which may be involved in cell-matrix interaction.}},

Journal = {{CHEST}},
Year = {{1995}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: To determine (1) the spectrum and frequency of causes
   of chronic cough with a history of excessive sputum production (CCS) and
   (2) the response of these causes to specific therapy.
   Study design: Prospective study utilizing the anatomic diagnostic
   protocol originally developed to diagnose chronic cough.
   Patients: Seventy-one immunocompetent adults who complained of
   expectoration of greater than 30 mt of sputum per day.
   Location: University hospital pulmonary outpatient clinic.
   Results: Patients were seen an average of 4.2 times over 4.6 months
   before a specific diagnosis was made, The cause of CCS was determined in
   97\%, It was due to one cause in 38\%, 2 in 36\%, and three in 26\%,
   Postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS) was a cause 40\% of the time, asthma
   24\%, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 15\%, bronchitis 11\%,
   bronchiectasis 4\%, left ventricular failure 3\%, and miscellaneous
   causes 3\%. Among patients with a normal chest radiograph who were
   nonsmokers and not taking an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor,
   CCS was due to PNDS, or asthma, or GERD, or all three in 100\% of cases.
   Chest radiograph, methacholine inhalation challenge, 24-h esophageal pH
   monitoring, bronchoscopy, and spirometry with bronchodilator each had a
   sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100\%, Chest radiograph and
   barium swallow had positive predictive values of only 38\% and 30\%,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: (1) The anatomic diagnostic protocol for cough is also
   valid for CCS; (2) the major causes of chronic excessive sputum
   production and chronic cough are so similar that CCS should be
   considered a form of chronic cough; (3) the evaluation of CCS is more
   complicated and takes longer than the evaluation of chronic cough; (4)
   the major strength of the laboratory diagnostic protocol is that it
   reliably rules out conditions; (5) the outcome of specific therapy is
   almost always successful; and (6) the term ``bronchorrhea{''} can be
   misleading if it is applied to excessive sputum production before a
   specific diagnosis of its source is made since the most common cause of
   excessive sputum that is expectorated (PNDS) is a disorder of the upper
   respiratory tract. Therefore, nonspecific therapies theoretically aimed
   at reducing mucus production in the lower respiratory tract are not
   likely to be helpful.}},

Abstract = {{A method for computing phase diagrams of polydisperse A/B polymer blends
   is proposed, based on Flory-Huggins-Staverman thermodynamics, and
   employed to obtain cloud-point curves (CPCs), shadow curves, spinodals
   and coexistence curves for a series of systems. Often bimodal CPCs and
   shadow curves result, even for systems with a concentration-independent
   interaction parameter g. The importance of coexistence curves, as
   opposed to CPCs, for judging the A/B miscibility, recently observed in
   polydisperse blends, is confirmed in this study. Particular attention is
   here paid to the critical state. Analytical relations are derived for
   the critical point (CP) and the critical slopes of the CPC and shadow
   curve, as well as for the criterion of CP stability, all in terms of
   various molar-mass averages of A and B. The latter criterion then yields
   conditions for the existence of heterogeneous double CPs and triple CPs,
   important as markers announcing the proximity of a three-phase region.
   Interestingly, the sign of the critical CPC slope depends solely on the
   relative magnitude of the r(z)/r(w) ratios for the two polymers A and B.
   Hence, a CP located at the CPC's top should not be interpreted as a
   proof of both polymers' monodispersity. The validity of derived
   analytical relations is confirmed by numerically computed phase
   diagrams.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To review patients who have presented with acute strokes from a
   middle cerebral artery occlusion in whom in addition to the middle
   cerebral artery thromboembolus, an internal carotid artery occlusion has
   been present, and in whom angioplasty of these totally occluded internal
   carotid arteries has been successful. METHODS: We reviewed
   retrospectively our experience in treating acute stroke patients with
   intracranial, intraarterial urokinase. Six of 27 patients had internal
   carotid artery occlusions in addition to middle cerebral artery
   occlusions. Two patients presented with spontaneous carotid dissections
   for which no further intervention from the ipsilateral internal carotid
   artery was attempted. in the remaining four internal carotid artery
   occlusions secondary to atherosclerotic disease, standard guide wires
   and catheters were negotiated across the level of the internal carotid
   artery occlusion, which expedited intracranial catheterization for
   thrombolysis. Subsequently, angioplasty of the internal carotid artery
   was performed. RESULTS: All four occluded internal carotid arteries
   could be traversed. No new neurologic deficits occurred. No vascular
   injuries occurred. No deaths occurred. Four- to 6-month follow-up showed

   occlusions of the internal carotid artery from atherosclerosis, the
   occluded vessel can sometimes be recanalized with low morbidity. In

Abstract = {{Background: Maternal antibodies to RhE may cause severe hemolytic
   disease. Based on recent RhD and RhCE sequence information, we have
   developed a DNA-based testing methodology to determine the RhEe genotype
   of fetuses at risk for RhE hemolytic disease from amniotic fluid (AF) or
   chorionic villus samples.
   Case: RhEe testing was undertaken in a fetus at risk for RhE hemolytic
   disease. Maternal serum anti-E titers had risen between 12-15 weeks'
   gestation. Optical density (OD450) AF readings also rose slightly
   between 22-24 weeks' gestation. Both maternal serum titers and AF
   bilirubin measurements provided early indications that the fetus might
   have the RhE antigen. Using amniotic cells obtained at the first
   amniocentesis, DNA was extracted and analyzed for the RhE gene sequence.
   The use of two primer pairs from distinct sites in the RhCE gene, plus
   analysis of parental DNA, greatly minimized the possibility of false
   results. The fetus was determined to be Rhe/Rhe by molecular analysis.
   The DNA result was confirmed by serologic typing at birth.
   Conclusion: DNA-based RhEe genotyping of at-risk fetuses provides
   accurate and timely information that is useful in the management of
   RhE-sensitized pregnancies.}},

Abstract = {{Standard procedures to culture rodent embryos (2-4 somite explanted
   embryos and a 48-hr culture period), do not allow assessment of genital
   crest differentiation. Cultures of older embryos have to be used for
   this objective. The proposed method uses glass apparatus derived from
   those initially decribed by New (1967) and Cockroft (1973). Each
   apparatus allows the culture of six embryos in 80 ml of a permanently
   gassed (95\% O-2) and circulating culture medium {[}Waymouth's
   medium-Hanks' balanced salt solution-rat serum (40:40:20, by vol.)]. In
   this system, 24 embryos (four groups of six) can be cultured under the
   same experimental conditions. In the mouse, the genital crest begins to
   develop on gestation day (GD) 9 and differentiation can be observed
   between GD12 and GD13 {[}GD0 = middle of the mating period (09.00-11.00
   hr)]. GD12 mouse embryos were cultured for 30 hr. An in vitro/in vivo
   comparison of survival rate, development and morphology was performed.
   Serial sections of cultured embryos were taken for microscopic
   examination. Survival rate proved to be 82\% using this method. No delay
   in general development was observed. Histological examination
   demonstrated that gonadal determination in cultured embryos also
   paralleled differentiation in vivo. The results clearly demonstrate that
   a 30-hr culture period of GD12 mouse embryos enables the study of the
   murine sexual determination.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of oxytocin (OX) on the function and morphology of the rat
   adrenal cortex were studied in vivo and in vitro. OX exerted a potent
   stimulatory action on basal, but not 10(-8) M ACTH-stimulated
   corticosterone (B) secretion of dispersed rat inner (zona fasciculata
   and zona reticularis) adrenocortical cells (maximal effective
   concentration: 10(-9) M); in contrast, at higher concentrations
   (10(-7)/10(-6) M) OX inhibited maximally ACTH-stimulated B output. A
   single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 1.2 nmol/100 g body weight OX
   resulted in a longlasting (up to 12 h) rise in plasma B concentration
   (PBC). The prolonged administration of OX (daily s.c. injections of 0.6
   or 1.2 nmo1/100 g for 10 days) caused a marked lowering in the adrenal
   weight and volume of all adrenocortical zones, that in turn was due to a
   decrease in the number of their parenchymal cells; however, the average
   volume of inner adrenocortical cells was significantly increased. Basal
   PBC was lowered, but its response to ether stress was unchanged in
   comparison with control rats. Prolonged OX treatment did not change B
   secretion by adrenal slices, but it markedly raised that of dispersed
   inner adrenocortical cells. Our present findings clearly show that the
   effects of OX on the adrenal cortex depend on the experimental model
   employed (in vitro versus in vivo) and the duration of treatment (acute
   versus chronic). Taken together they allow us to conclude that OX exerts
   an acute direct timulatory effect on the rat adrenal cortex, and a
   chronic inhibitory one, that at least in part could be due to the
   interference of OX with the mechanism(s) of intracellular transduction
   of the ACTH secretagogue signal.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to characterize electrophysiologically
   neurones in organotypic cultures of the rat ventral mesencephalon and to
   compare these results with results published for the same neurones in
   other types of preparation. Intracellular recordings were obtained in 3-
   to 8-week-old organotypic slice cultures of the ventral mesencephalon
   prepared from newborn rats. Dopaminergic neurones were distinguished
   from non-dopaminergic neurones by staining with the autofluorescent
   serotonin analogue 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine and briefly viewing the
   preparation with short exposures to ultraviolet (UV) light (365 nm).
   Short exposures to UV light did not affect the electrophysiological
   properties. There were no significant differences between dopaminergic
   and non-dopaminergic neurones with regard to resting membrane potential
   or action potential threshold and amplitude, and in both types of
   neurone spontaneous burst activity and glutamatergic excitatory
   postsynaptic potentials were seen. There were differences in the
   following parameters, which can be used to distinguish between the two
   types of neurone. Dopa minergic neurones had broad action potentials
   (2-9 ms), high input resistance (mean 81 M Omega), were silent or fired
   spontaneously at a low frequency (0-9 Hz), and no spontaneous
   GABA(A)-ergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials or inward rectification
   were present. In contrast, non-dopaminergic neurones had fast action
   potentials (0.6-3.2 ms), low input resistance (mean 32 M Omega), were
   silent or fired spontaneously at relatively high firing frequency (0-28
   Hz), and sometimes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and inward
   rectification were seen. In the presence of 1 mu M tetrodotoxin and 10
   mM tetraethylammonium, Ca2+ spikes could be evoked in both dopaminergic
   and non-dopaminergic neurones. Dopaminergic neurones in 3- to 8-week-old
   organotypic slice cultures have a number of distinguishing
   electrophysiological characteristics similar to those recorded in other
   types of acute or cultured preparations. However, some intrinsic
   regulatory mechanisms, namely the slow oscillatory potentials, inward
   rectification and the K+ current, I-A, seem to be missing in the
   cultured neurones.}},

   of its own. In the balance between these, those who pay are not
   necessarily the same as those who gain. Various forms of analysis are
   employed in relating illness costs at individual and societal levels
   with those of measures intended to contain them. Questions that arise
   are whether costs are saved overall by treatment, and which of different
   treatment options give greater savings. In the absence of much data,
   there is heavy dependence on assumptions in attempts to answer these
   questions. A full analysis should take into account the extent to which
   the availability of new and very effective treatments might alter demand

Abstract = {{Exposure of Ceramiaceae indet., an undescribed filamentous red alga, to
   an irradiance of 819 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for various lengths of time (up
   to 120 min) had no effect on its photosynthetic performance. Exposure to
   3 114 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for 30 min or longer caused a significant
   decrease in its photosynthetic capacity. Compared to the responses of
   other species, Ceramiaceae indet. appears to be able to tolerate far
   higher levels of irradiance than most species. Ceramiaceae indet. was
   able to slowly acclimatize (over 7 days) to temperature changes within
   the range tested (15-25 degrees C). Rapid 5 degrees C increases in
   temperature within this range increased photosynthetic performance, as
   indicated by an increase in P-max. However, a rapid increase or decrease
   of 10 degrees C significantly reduced photosynthesis. Ceramiaceae indet.
   displayed pH-sensitive photosynthesis, with an increase in
   photosynthesis in acidic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Active magnetic bearings provide revolutionary advantages for gas
   turbine engine rotor support. These advantages include tremendously
   improved vibration and stability characteristics, reduced power loss,
   improved reliability, fault tolerance, and greatly extended bearing
   service life. The marriage of these advantages with innovative
   structural network design and advanced materials utilization will permit
   major increases in thrust-to-weight performance and structural
   efficiency for future gas turbine engines. However, obtaining the
   maximum payoff requires two key ingredients. The first is the use of
   modern magnetic bearing technologies such as innovative digital control
   techniques, high-density power electronics, high-density magnetic
   actuators, fault-tolerant system architecture, and electronic
   (sensorless) position estimation. This paper describes these
   technologies and the test hardware currently in place for verifying the
   performance of advanced magnetic actuators, power electronics, and
   digital controls. The second key ingredient is to go beyond the simple
   replacement of rolling element bearings with magnetic bearings by
   incorporating magnetic bearings as an integral part of the overall
   engine design. This is analogous to the proper approach to designing
   with composites, whereby the designer tailors the geometry and
   load-carrying function of the structural system or component for the
   composite instead of simply substituting composites in a design
   originally intended for metal material. This paper describes
   methodologies for the design integration of magnetic bearings in gas
   turbine engines.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrostatic pulmonary edema can be defined as an abnormal increase in
   extravascular water secondary to elevated pressure in the pulmonary
   circulation, as in congestive heart failure or intravascular volume
   overload. The diagnosis of hydrostatic pulmonary edema is usually based
   on clinical information, conventional chest radiograph findings, and
   response to treatment and does not require high-resolution CT. However,
   recognizing the appearance of hydrostatic pulmonary edema on
   high-resolution CT can be important, as the edema can mimic other
   diseases or can occur as an unsuspected finding in patients having
   high-resolution CT for other indications, and a misdiagnosis may lead to
   unnecessary lung biopsy. Although the CT appearances of pulmonary edema
   have been described in several studies {[}1-3], to date, the
   high-resolution CT appearances of hydrostatic pulmonary edema have been
   described only in isolated cases {[}4-6] or in experimental studies of
   phantom or animal models {[}7, 8]. This essay illustrates the spectrum
   of high-resolution CT findings seen in adult patients with hydrostatic
   pulmonary edema secondary to cardiac disease.}},

Abstract = {{Leishmanial antigens which stimulate T lymphocytes from primed
   individuals may be candidates for a vaccine. We recently found a
   significant concordance between the humoral response specific for two
   proteins from Leishmania infantum promastigotes, p14 and p18, and a
   positive leishmanin delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, testifying
   to the occurrence of cell-mediated immunity. In this communication, we
   describe a partial characterization of these antigens and an in vitro
   analysis of their capacity to activate primed human T tells. We showed,
   by immunofluorescent staining and through analysis of subcellular
   fractions by Western immunoblotting, that in stationary-phase
   promastigotes, p14 and p18 were located only in the parasite nuclei; in
   the middle of the log phase, a transitory and only weak expression
   outside the nucleus was detected. We then showed that p14 and p18
   antigens shared a common epitope(s). Finally, we analyzed the in vitro
   proliferation and interleukin-2 production induced by leishmanial
   proteins in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from sensitized
   subjects. We showed that in some individuals who have been exposed to L.
   infantum the specific response to the whole lysate was mostly due to the
   nuclear antigens. We demonstrated directly the capacity of
   nitrocellulose-bound p14 and p18 to activate in vitro all of the tested
   primed peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which contrasted with a lack
   of stimulatory activity of other membrane-bound leishmanial proteins.
   Taken together, our results suggest that an antigenic determinant(s)
   dominant for some individuals might exist on both antigens.}},

Abstract = {{Dopamine and related compounds are known to be toxic to melanoma cells.
   Some of their toxicity may be related, in part, to the oxidation
   products generated from them upon their interaction with melanogenic
   enzymes. In this paper, we present our studies on the oxidation
   chemistry of 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine, the lower homolog of dopamine.
   Mushroom tyrosinase catalyzed oxidation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine
   rapidly generated the corresponding quinone. However,
   aminomethyl-o-benzoquinone thus formed did not accumulate in the
   reaction mixture, but readily transformed to another product that
   exhibited absorbance maxima at 280 and 310 nm. This compound was
   identified to be 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde based on its HPLC elution
   profile, cochromatography with authentic sample and UV spectral
   properties. Possible mechanism for the formation
   3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde from 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine and the nature

Abstract = {{The dynamics of spin locking for half-integer quadrupolar nuclei under
   sample rotation is investigated. It is shown both theoretically and
   experimentally that the spin-locking efficiency decreases significantly
   when the MAS rotation frequency is equal to the amplitude of the
   spin-locking RF field. This can be explained as a rotation-induced
   resonance effect. It is demonstrated that the second-order quadrupole
   interaction plays an important role in reducing the spin-locking
   efficiency and causes a significant lineshape distortion. The behavior
   of spin locking under DOR is shown to be similar to that under MAS.
   Based on this understanding of the spin-locking dynamics, an Al-27 CPDOR
   spectrum for the molecular sieve AlPO4-11 was obtained with a good
   signal-to-noise ratio. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

   experience of each other, in an aviary with food and water. Aggression
   occurred more often between two males than between a male and a female
   and more frequently between pairs of males including at least one old
   male than between two young males. Dominance was not related to male
   colour in trials between males of the same age class, but it was in
   trials between an old and a young male, often differing in colour. Thus,
   age may be a more important determinant of dominance than colour. Female
   preference for more colourful males was tested by allowing
   hormone-induced females to choose between a more and a less colourful
   dummy male. Females spent more time in front of more colourful than
   drabber males and also more often perched beside colourful males than
   duller individuals. Although male colour cannot be ruled out as a
   dominance signal, the results suggest that male colour is primarily used
   as a signal in mate choice. Female choice may hence be responsible for
   maintenance of bright plumage in the male yellowhammer.}},

Abstract = {{When selecting the frequency response of a hearing aid, a target is
   usually selected using a predictive formula from the international
   literature. Nowadays real ear measurements can readily be carried out to
   ensure that the real ear gain closely matches the prescribed target.
   Such measurements are usually only carried out on a subset of patients
   fitted in the UK, though it has been suggested that they should be
   carried out on all hearing aid prescriptions. Real ear insertion gains
   were measured on 319 first-time National Health Service (NHS) hearing
   aid issues. A total of 181 (57\%) failed to come within 10 dB of the
   target gain at one or more frequencies between 0.25 and 3 kHz. Though
   there were audiometric differences between those who achieved
   satisfactory gain and those who did not, there was too much overlap
   between groups to make any audiometric index or combination of indices
   of value in predicting the likelihood of failure to achieve target gain.
   Sixty-eight patients with inadequate real ear gain were invited to
   attend for alterations to their hearing aid prescription. Twelve (18\%)
   were fitted with a high frequency aid, while the rest were managed by
   alterations to their NHS aid or to the earmould and tubing. After
   appropriate changes, 58 (85\%) achieved a satisfactory gain. The routine
   use of real ear insertion gains in all hearing aid fittings would result
   in many patients having a more accurately fitted hearing aid. As the
   majority of prescriptions could be adequately improved using NHS hearing
   aids, the effects on the hearing aid budget would be relatively small.}},

   bi-orthogonal, but it can be shown to be complete in a weak sense.
   Poisson's equation can be solved approximately by truncating the
   expansion of the potential in such a set. A simple example of a
   potential which is not one of the basis functions is expanded using the
   symmetric members of the basis set up to fourth order. The basis
   functions up to first order are reconstructed approximately using 10 000

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development and verification of a predictive

   essentially derived from metal cutting theory and for the geometric
   relations of the ball-end milling process. A concise method for
   characterizing the complex geometry of a ball-end mill is first
   determined. This method of generation not only simplifies the
   description of the geometry of the cutting edge, but also provides the
   basis for the determination of all geometric parameters to an accuracy
   commensurate with that needed for the oblique cutting process. The force
   model developed in able to deal with many of the process variables,
   including changes in the axial and radial depths of cut and in the
   feed-rate, as well as the eccentricity (run-out) inevitably found in
   practice. As a result, the predicted cutting forces show a fairly good
   agreement with the values from the verification experiments.}},

   increased. The interaction effect in the presence of short-range

Abstract = {{Two kinds of calcium-dimyristoylphosphatidic acid (DMPA) complexes at
   acidic and neutral pH conditions were prepared in the following ways.
   The complex at pH 4 was obtained by adding Ca2+ to DMPA dispersion in
   pure water. On the other hand, the complex at pH 7.4 was obtained by
   adding Ca2+ to DMPA dispersion in the presence of NaOH. The
   stoichiometries of Ca2+ ion to DMPA molecule are 0.5-0.67 and similar to
   1 for the complexes at pH 4 and 7.4, respectively. Static x-ray
   diffraction shows that the hydrocarbon chains of the Ca2+-DMPA complex
   at pH 4 at 20 degrees C are more tightly packed than those of the
   complex at pH 7.4 at 20 degrees C. Furthermore, the complex at pH 4 at
   20 degrees C gives rise to several reflections that might be related to
   the ordered arrangement of the Ca2+ ions. These results indicate that
   the structure of the complex at pH 4 is crystalline-like. In the
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram, the complex at pH
   7.4 undergoes no phase transition in a temperature range between 30 and
   80 degrees C. On the other hand, in the DSC thermogram for the complex
   at pH 4, a peak appears at 65.8 degrees C in the first heating scan. in
   the successive second heating scan, a transition peak appears at 63.5
   degrees C. In connection with the DSC results, the structural changes
   associated with these phase transitions were studied with
   temperature-scan x-ray diffraction. In the first heating scan, although
   a peak appears at 65.8 degrees C in the DSC thermogram, the hydrocarbon
   chain packing gradually converts from an orthorhombic lattice to a
   hexagonal lattice near 52 degrees C, and successively the chain melting
   phase transition occurs near 67 degrees C. In the second heating scan,
   the hydrocarbon chains are packed in a hexagonal lattice over the whole
   temperature range and the chain melting phase transition occurs near
   63.5 degrees C, Therefore, the Ca2+-DMPA complex at pH 4 has a
   metastable state. The metastable state transforms to a stable state by
   maintaining the complex at pH 4 for about 90 h at 20 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility and possible increased sensitivity of
   fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images for the detection of
   tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis, compared with standard
   T2-weighted images, and to evaluate whether the tubers are correlated
   with neurologic symptoms. METHOD: We examined the number, size, and
   location of tubers in five tuberous sclerosis patients using T2-weighted
   and FLAIR images. Their intelligence quotients, ages at the onset of the
   first seizure, seizure types, and epileptic severity also were studied
   retrospectively. RESULTS: The number of tubers observed ranged from 4 to
   17 on T2-weighted images, and from 10 to 33 on FLAIR images. All the
   tubers, other than the myelination line on T2-weighted images, were
   remarkably demonstrated as high-intensity lesions on FLAIR images. No
   correlation was found between the neurologic outcome and the number,
   size, or location of tubers on FLAIR images. CONCLUSION: FLAIR images
   were very sensitive for the detection of tubers, especially small
   subcortical ones, the number, size, and location of which are not
   related to the neurologic symptoms.}},

   low yield, Alternatively, benzyl cyanides 5b-e were converted
   successfully to the esters 7b-e, 8b-e, and 9b-e, which were fluorinated
   with FClO3 to produce the fluoro esters 10b-e, 11b-e, and 12b-d, in good
   yields. However, the attempted ester cleavage of these compounds did not
   give 3b-e, Carboxyl group introduction into 5e afforded 13, and
   fluorination with either F-2 or FClO3 gave complex mixtures.
   Carboxylation of the naphthyl analog 16 obtained from 15 did not give
   14a. However, fluorination of 18 derived from 17 proceeded readily to
   give 19, which was hydrolyzed to produce 14a, Optically active(-)-14a
   was obtained through enzymatic hydrolysis. The racemic acid 14a was
   condensed with three representative chiral nucleophiles to give 14b-d.
   From the H-1- and F-19-NMR spectra of these derivatives, it was

Abstract = {{Background: To evaluate the acute and long-term results of `tandem
   lesion' coronary angioplasty in the left anterior descending artery, and
   to identify the determinants of restenosis.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical, angiographic, and
   procedure-related variables was carried out on a consecutive series of
   102 patients (mean age 54 years, range 34-71 years; 77\% men) who had
   undergone tandem lesion coronary angioplasty in the left anterior
   descending artery (204 lesions) between 1981 and 1991.
   Results: Angiographic success was achieved in 96 patients (94\%) and 195
   lesions (96\%). Clinical success was achieved in 91 patients (89\%).
   Five patients (5\%) suffered a non-fatal Q-wave myocardial infarction.
   No procedural deaths occurred. Complete follow-up data were available
   for all 102 patients (median 46 months, range 1-122 months). During the
   follow-up period, two patients (2\%) died, two (2\%) suffered non-fatal
   myocardial infarction, and 18 (18\%) underwent a second
   revascularization procedure. The cumulative probability of survival was
   98.9\% and 97.8\% at 1 and 5 years respectively. Survival free from
   myocardial infarction, bypass surgery and repeat angioplasty at 1 and 5
   years was 80.8\% and 74.9\% respectively. Thirty patients underwent
   repeat angiography (mean 8.8 months) for symptoms or evidence of
   reversible ischaemia. Restenosis occurred at a single dilated site in 14
   patients and at both sites concurrently in six patients. Eight patients
   had no restenosis but two had total occlusion of the left anterior
   descending artery. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified
   increased inflation frequency as the only independent predictor of
   restenosis.
   Conclusions: Tandem lesion coronary angioplasty of the left anterior
   descending artery can be performed with a high primary success rate and
   favourable long-term outcome. The fact that restenosis occurred at a
   single site more often than at both, suggests that systemic factors are
   less important than local factors in influencing restenosis.}},

Abstract = {{Cobalt(III) oxidation was applied to an on-line pretreatment of organic
   phosphorus compounds in a system of flow injection analysis (FIA). An
   FIA manifold, comprised parts for cobalt(III) oxidation and subsequent
   Molybdenum Blue spectrophotometric measurement, was assembled and the
   analytical conditions of the system were optimized. A platinum wire (0.2
   mmX3 m) was inserted in a pretreatment coil (1 mm i.d.X5 m) for
   accelerating the digestion of organic phosphorus compounds by
   cobalt(III) ions. Cobalt(III) ions could completely convert organic
   phosphorus (<1 mg dm(-3)) to phosphate ions with the aid of the platinum
   catalyst at room temperature and in a relatively short time (average
   residence time in the coil: ca. 7 min). The detection limit for
   phosphorus by the subsequent spectrophotometry was 0.005 mg dm(-3))
   (S/N=3) and the relative standard deviation of repeated measurements
   (n=10) was below 3\% for 1 mg dm(-3) (as P) disodium phenylphosphate.
   The present method reduced the amounts of the pretreatment and
   coloration reagents required and the time for analysis (10-12 samples
   could be determined per 1 h), compared to the amounts and time needed
   for the batchwise pretreatment method.}},

Abstract = {{Carrier transport in pn-junction is re-examined using McKelvey's flux
   method, A simple but physically based treatment of carrier transport
   leads to new expressions for the `'law of the junction,'' quasi-Fermi
   level, I-V characteristics, base transit time, and probability of
   carrier backscattering from the space charge region, which are valid
   from the ballistic through the diffusive regimes, Comparision with Monte
   Carlo simulation shows that the deduced backscattering rate well
   describes the bias dependence, For silicon pn-junctions, the
   backscattering rate under reverse bias conditions is less than 5\%,
   satisfying the Bethe condition of thermionic emission, while it rapidly
   increases with forward bias until drift-diffusion governs the transport,
   The effect of thin-base transport and backscattering on the current,
   carrier velocity, and distribution function is also investigated. It is
   found that for a base thickness less than 50 nm even silicon transistors
   enter the quasi-ballistic transport regime, These results should prove
   useful not only for fundamental understanding of the pn-junction
   transport, but also for careful design of advanced transistors.}},

   anesthesia; Group 3, spinal anesthesia with subsequent general
   anesthesia. The perioperative time course was divided into six intervals
   from entry into the operating room to discharge from the postanesthesia
   care unit (PACU). Total time was calculated by adding the six intervals.
   There were 85 patients in Group 1, 17 patients in Group 2, and 4
   patients in Group 3. The mean times for surgical readiness once the
   anesthesiologist was present for Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 were 21.4
   +/- 7.3, 21.4 +/- 6.0, and 25.0 +/- 5.8 min, respectively. The total

Abstract = {{An interpretation of the electromagnetic energy flux at high latitudes
   under steady state conditions is presented and analyzed through modeling
   of the large-scale coupling between the high-latitude ionosphere and
   magnetosphere. In this paper we elucidate the steady state relationship
   between the electromagnetic energy flux (divergence of the de Poynting
   flux), the Joule heating rate, and the mechanical energy transfer rate
   in the high-latitude ionosphere. We also demonstrate the important role
   of the neutral wind and its conductivity-weighted distribution with
   altitude in determining the resultant exchange of electromagnetic energy
   at high latitudes. Because the Poynting flux approach accounts for the
   neutral wind implicitly and describes the net electro-magnetic energy
   flux between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, it is a fundamental
   measure of energy transfer in the system. A significant portion of this
   energy transfer results in Joule heating; however, the conversion of
   electromagnetic energy flux into mechanical energy of the neutrals is
   also considerable and can in some regions exceed the Joule heating rate.
   We will show that neglect of the neutral dynamics in calculations of the
   Joule heating rate can be misleading. To evaluate and interpret the
   electromagnetic energy flux at high latitudes, we employ the vector
   spherical harmonic model, which is based on the National Center for
   Atmospheric Research thermosphere-ionosphere general circulation model,
   to provide the steady state properties of the thermosphere-ionosphere
   system under moderate to quiet geomagnetic activity. For the specific
   geophysical conditions modeled we conclude that (1) the electromagnetic
   energy flux is predominantly directed into the high-latitude ionosphere
   with greater input in the morning sector than in the evening sector, as
   supported by DE 2 observations. (2) The Joule heating rate accounts for
   much of the electromagnetic energy deposited in the ionosphere with the
   conductivity-weighted neutral wind contributing significantly to the
   Joule healing rate and thus affecting the net electromagnetic energy
   flux in the ionosphere. (3) On average, the mechanical energy transfer
   rate amounts to about 10\% to 30\% of the net electromagnetic energy
   flux in the auroral dawn, dusk, and polar cap regions, acting as a sink
   of electromagnetic energy flux in the dawn and dusk sectors and a source
   in the polar cap. (4) Weak regions of upward electromagnetic energy flux
   are found near the convection reversal boundaries where the mechanical
   energy transfer rate exceeds the Joule heating rate. In general, large
   upward electromagnetic energy fluxes may be rare, as the always
   positive-Joule heating rate increases irrespective of the source of
   electromagnetic energy flux; that is, neutral dynamics contribute
   directly to the Joule heating rate.}},

Abstract = {{The aromatic poylethersulphone (PES) is a well known polymer for the
   preparation of membranes with excellent thermal stability and chemical
   resistance. The disadvantage of PES-membranes is their hydrophobic
   character, which in contact with protein containing solutions leads to
   high protein adsorption and as a consequence to deterioration of
   membrane properties. In this report the surface modification of PES by
   means of glow discharge induced grafting of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate
   (HEMA) is described. Graft polymerisation creates a largely wettable
   layer of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) on the surface of
   PES. This has been shown by contact angle measurements using the
   Wilhelmy plate method. Chemical characterization is carried out by means
   of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared
   spectroscopy/attentuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR). The influence of
   storage conditions on the surface properties of modified PES samples has
   been investigated after storage in vacuum, water, and air.}},

   Total forage destruction rates varied between sites (38-64 mg total
   forage per feeding day) but not between years at a given site. When
   forage was increased by adding supplemental water, destruction rates
   were not influenced. Estimated forage destruction rates were similar to

   with N levels from 50 to 300 kg . ha(-1) and target SWT levels of 7,0
   and 4.0 kPa, Unutilized fertilizer N was the difference between
   fertilized. and nonfertilized plots in total N inputs not harvested in
   the crop. When excessive irrigation was not applied (SWT between 6.5 and
   7.4 kPa), 95\% of the maximum crop yield and yield quality (head length
   and fresh mass) response occurred at N rates of 156 to 193 kg . ha(-1)
   with unutilized fertilizer N <60 kg . ha(-1). Excessive irrigation (4:6
   kPa) resulted in lower yields and yield quality and higher unutilized
   fertilizer N. Romaine accumulated >74\% of its total N uptake in the 38
   days before harvest, Unutilized fertilizer N increased sharply when
   adequate N and water rates were exceeded, These results suggest that a

Abstract = {{Political discrimination has often pushed the domestic value of
   agriculture in developing countries below its value in markets at the
   border. This paper seeks to explain the reasons why border prices
   themselves undervalue the linkages that agriculture has to economic
   growth in the early stages of development. If agriculture is critically
   important to stimulating and sustaining rapid economic growth, those
   countries that fail to correct this discrimination exact a heavy toll in
   economic performance. Furthermore, the poorest countries will suffer the
   most. Agricultural development and development of the non-agricultural
   economy are closely linked. The traditional market-mediated linkages
   form the core of economic analysis of the role of agriculture in
   economic development: providing labour for an industrial work-force,
   food for an expanding population with higher incomes, savings for
   industrial investments, markets for industrial output, export earnings
   to pay for imported capital goods, and raw materials for agro-processing
   industries. A second category of linkages is not well mediated by market
   forces, even when markets are working well. The impact of agricultural
   growth on the rest of the economy through non-market linkages can be
   traced using a simple growth-accounting framework that examines
   contributions to the labour force, capital investment and the
   productivity with which these two physical factors are utilised. Several
   linkages stand out as likely to be important and potentially measurable
   because they draw on the efficiency of decision making in rural
   households, the low opportunity cost of their labour resources, the
   opportunity for farm investment without financial intermediaries, the
   potential to earn high rates of return on public investments that
   correct for urban bias, the contribution of food price stability to
   increased efficiency in investment decisions, and the impact of growth
   in food production on widespread improvement in nutrient intake and
   labour productivity. Each of these factors alone, as public investment
   and favourable policy stimulate growth in the agricultural sector,
   should cause an increase in the efficiency of resource allocation and
   thus higher total factor productivity. Several of these mechanisms will
   also serve to speed factor accumulation by increasing the savings rate
   or improving factor mobility.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the significance of song in sexual
   isolation in Drosophila biauraria. Interspecific copulation was not
   observed with a heterospecific D. triauraria male that had intact wings,
   although it was often observed when the male's wings were removed,
   indicating that heterospecific courtship song elicits female rejection,
   and prevents copulation. Artificially synthesized songs were played to a
   female with a wingless, antennaless male. The conspecific inter-pulse
   interval of artificial song increased mating frequency, whereas the
   heterospecific, longer or shorter, inter-pulse interval significantly
   decreased the frequency. The mating frequency with random noise and
   silence showed intermediate values. Female rejection behaviour was
   greater with heterospecific than with conspecific inter-pulse intervals
   of artificial song; with random song and silence female responses were
   intermediate. This indicates that the inter-pulse interval is used as a
   species discriminator in D. biauraria females. It is suggested that the
   female's ability to discriminate inter-pulse intervals and her
   responses, rejection and acceptance, have evolved under the influence of
   reinforcement, reproductive character displacement, or both, which

   in selectively bred MH susceptible (MHS) and MH non-susceptible (MHN)
   swine. MH crisis was induced by halothane challenge, and dantrolene was
   administered in order to measure inositol polyphosphates after MH
   reversal. Muscle biopsies of skeletal muscles of the hind limbs were
   obtained in random order and inositol polyphosphates determined by high
   pressure liquid chromatography using a metal dye detection method.
   Inositol polyphosphates were determined in three groups: (1) MHS vs MHN
   basal, (2) during MH crisis induced by halothane and (3) following
   treatment with dantrolene after halothane challenge. Clinical variables
   (P (v) over bar O-2, P (v) over bar CO2, PE'(CO2) and pH) indicated that
   MH was readily induced in MHS swine. Basal concentrations of all
   inositol polyphosphates were higher in MHS swine compared with MHN
   swine. After halothane challenge, 1,3,4-IP3, 1,3,4,6-IP4 and 1,3,4,5-IP4
   concentrations increased in MHS animals compared with the respective

   Dantrolene administration decreased inositol polyphosphate

Abstract = {{A contig of 21 nonchimeric yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) has been
   assembled across 1.5 Mb of the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene region
   located at 7q21, and formatted with Four previously reported probes, six
   newly isolated probes, and three sequence-tagged sites (STSs) From
   internal and end Fragments of YACs. A physical map of rare cutter
   restriction enzyme sites across the region was also constructed by
   pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (PFGE) analysis of four overlapping YAC
   clones. The amplification unit of this region in different cell lines
   was then determined by Southern blot analysis on the basis of the
   physical map and probes. Amplified DNA was located in extrachromosomal
   elements in human MDR cell lines studied here, and the size of the
   amplification unit was determined to be discrete in one MDR
   amplification but variable in others.}},

Abstract = {{RECENT IN VITRO FINDINGS INDICATE that cytokines represent an important
   pathway of connective tissue destruction in human periodontitis. The

   to compare the levels of these molecules in gingival crevicular fluids
   (GCF) from patients with adult periodontitis (experimental group) and
   from individuals with clinically healthy gingiva (control group). GCF
   was collected for 30 seconds using a periopaper strip and the volume of
   the sample determined. Following elution of the fluid, assays for IL-1
   beta and IL-8 were carried out by ELISA. The concentrations (ng/ml) of
   cytokines were calculated in the original volume of GCF on each strip.
   The total amounts (pg/site) of cytokines were expressed as the
   concentrations multiplied by volumes of GCF. The total amounts of IL-1
   beta and IL-8 of the experimental group were significantly higher than
   the control group. The total amounts of both cytokines were markedly
   reduced following phase 1 periodontal treatment. The clinical parameters
   were positively related to the total amounts of IL-1 beta and IL-8. IL-1
   beta concentrations and total amounts were also positively related to
   IL-8 suggesting that the GCF IL-8 levels are influenced by local IL-1
   beta activities. These data indicate that the total amounts of IL-1 beta
   and IL-8 exhibited dynamic changes upon severity of periodontal disease.
   The levels of IL-1 beta and IL-8 in GCF are valuable in detecting the
   inflammation of periodontal tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. This study sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of
   captopril therapy for survivors of myocardial infarction. Background.
   The recent randomized, controlled Survival and Ventricular Enlargement
   (SAVE) trial shelved that captopril therapy improves survival in
   survivors of myocardial infarction with an ejection fraction less than
   or equal to 40\%. The present ancillary study was designed to determine
   how the costs required to achieve this increase in survival compared
   with those of other medical interventions.
   Methods. We developed a decision analytic model to assess the
   cost-effectiveness of captopril therapy in 50- to 80-year old survivors
   of myocardial infarction with an ejection fraction less than or equal to
   40\%. Data on costs, utilities (health related quality of life weights)
   and 4-year survival were obtained directly from the SAVE trial, and
   long-term survival was estimated using a Markov model. In one set of
   analyses, we assumed that the survival benefit associated with captopril
   therapy would persist beyond 4 years (persistent benefit analyses),
   whereas in another set we assumed that captopril therapy incurred costs
   but no survival benefit beyond 4 years (limited benefit analyses).
   Results. In the limited-benefit analyses, the incremental
   cost-effectiveness of captopril therapy ranged from
   \$3,600/quality-adjusted life year for 80-year old patients to
   \$60,800/quality-adjusted life-year for 50-year old patients. In the
   persistent-benefit analyses, incremental cost effectiveness ratios
   ranged from \$3,700 to \$10,400/quality adjusted life-year, depending on
   age. The outcome was generally not sensitive to changes in estimates of
   variables when they were varied individually over wide ranges. In a
   `'worst-case'' analysis, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for
   captopril therapy remained favorable (\$8,700 to
   \$29,200/quality-adjusted life-year) for 60- to 80-year old patients but
   were higher (\$217,600/quality-adjusted life-year) for 50-year old
   patients.
   Conclusions. We conclude that the cost-effectiveness of captopril
   therapy for 50- to 80-year old survivors of myocardial infarction with a
   low ejection fraction compares favorably with other interventions for
   survivors of myocardial infarction.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1985 we have practised scan directed unilateral cervical
   exploration for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) on the
   basis of a solitary parathyroid adenoma, and who had a pre-operative
   thallium-technetium subtraction scintigram demonstrating one focus of
   activity (positive scan), Between 1985 and 1993, a total of 160 patients
   with proven HPT and a technically satisfactory scintigram underwent neck
   exploration, Of these, 96 had positive preoperative scans, 81 (84.4\%)
   of which accurately predicted the site of the tumour subsequently
   retrieved at operation, Seventy-four (77.6\%) with positive scans, and
   80 of the entire group, underwent unilateral cervical exploration with
   removal of a presumed single adenoma, Seventy-eight (97.5\%) of these
   patients were cured of their HPT; two patients demonstrated mild
   persistent hypercalcaemia, Median operating time was significantly
   reduced for patients having unilateral as opposed to bilateral
   operation, Our results suggest that, when positive, thallium-technetium
   subtraction scintigraphy will accurately predict the site of a solitary
   parathyroid adenoma in a high proportion of patients and will thus
   permit a unilateral parathyroid exploration in these individuals, The
   usefulness of the technique is limited by its low sensitivity for small
   tumours.}},

Abstract = {{Aeromycoflora studies above an `'Aman'' variety of paddy (Oryza sativa
   L.) were carried out for two consecutive seasons, in 1990 and 1991, in
   the vicinity of Barrackpore, West Bengal, by means of the culture plate
   exposure technique. A more or less uniform spore concentration was
   observed during the early part of the vegetative stages in 1990 with an
   abrupt increase and peak during the maximum vegetative growth period. In
   1991, a uniform spore count was found up until the flowering stages. A
   gradual increase in spore count after flowering was recorded in both
   seasons with the highest peaks during harvesting, followed by a sudden
   decrease after the harvest. The dominant genera isolated were
   Aspergillus, Curvularia, Cladosporium and Penicillium. Aspergillus
   appeared in high concentrations from the very beginning of the crop
   season up to the flowering stages, with a gradual fall after flowering
   while Cladosporium showed the reverse pattern. Curvularia and
   Penicillium occurred regularly throughout the crop season.
   Phytopathogenic types were represented by Helminthosporium oryzae,
   Fusarium, Alternaria and Nigrospora. Helminthosporium oryzae appeared in
   the air when the plants attained appreciable vegetative growth, bring
   seen as `'brown spots'' on the foliage, and reaching peak concentration
   during harvesting. Fusarium in contrast to Alternaria appeared regularly
   in the air except during the later part of vegetative growth. Nigrospora
   was recorded only occasionally. A considerable number of `'Sterile
   Forms'' were present throughout both seasons.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. It has been accepted that retinal dystrophin is localized in
   the outer plexiform layer (OPL) of the retina, but no electron
   microscopic evidence has been reported until now. Using immunoelectron
   microscopy, the authors investigate whether retinal dystrophin localizes
   at the presynaptic or postsynaptic membrane of synaptic regions.
   Methods. Monoclonal antibody raised against human dystrophin C-terminus
   was used. Immunoblotting analysis was used for testing dystrophin
   protein in retinal tissues. Tissue preparations were stained with the
   immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase method and were observed with
   light and electron microscopy.
   Results. Immunoblotting analysis showed a molecular weight of band 420
   kDa in the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of
   the retinal tissues. Immunoelectron microscopy disclosed that retinal
   dystrophin was localized at the presynaptic membrane of synaptic regions
   in the OPL.
   Conclusions. Rat retinal dystrophin localizes at the presynaptic
   membrane in the OPL, suggesting that it may play some role in the
   neurotransmitter release of the photoreceptor cell.}},

Abstract = {{Two new tumor-suppressor genes, the cyclin dependent kinase 4 inhibitor

   cloned and mapped on chromosomes 9p and 3p respectively, where putative
   tumor-suppressor genes of the oral squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) may be
   present. In order to elucidate whether abnormalities of these genes
   could contribute to the tumorigenesis of oral SCC, genomic DNAs from 62
   tissue samples of tumors (32 primary SCCs and 30 pre-cancerous lesions)
   and from 7 oral SCC cell lines were examined by polymerase chain
   reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA
   sequencing. Four of 7 (57\%) cell lines contained nonsense mutations or
   missense mutations in the p16/CDKN2 gene and 2 of 32 (6\%) primary oral
   SCCs had nonsense mutations. Particularly, 3 of 4 nonsense mutations
   detected in the present study were found in codon 80 (CGA-->TGA;
   Arg-->Stop), suggesting that codon 80 was a mutational hot spot of the
   p16/CDKN2 gene. No VHL gene mutation was found in any subject. These
   results suggest that mutation of the VHL gene is not a common factor in
   the development of human oral SCC. In contrast, the p16/CDKN2 gene may
   be correlated with the progression of a subtype of this cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine whether an increased resting energy expenditure
   (REE) and weight loss in lung cancer patients are related to a systemic
   inflammatory response.
   Materials and Methods: REE was measured by indirect calorimetry using a
   ventilated hood system, Soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 55
   (sTNF-R55) and sTNF-R75, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule
   (sICAM)-1, soluble E (sE)-selectin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding
   protein (LBP), interleukin (IL)-6, and TNF-alpha were measured using
   sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and C-reactive
   protein (CRP) was measured by turbidimetry. A cross-sectional study was
   performed to compare inflammatory mediators between hypermetabolic
   (REE/Harris Benedict {[}HE] equation greater than or equal to 110\%)
   versus normometabolic (REE/HB < 110\%) patients and between patients who
   lost weight (more than 10\% loss of preillness weight) versus those
   whose weight remained stable.
   Results: Eighty-seven patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer
   were consecutively entered onto the study, Mean REE expressed as a
   percentage of the HE reference values wets 118\% +/- 12\%; 67 patients
   were considered hypermetabolic. Twenty-six patients had a substantial
   loss of more than 10\% of their preillness weight. Hypermetabolic
   patients were found to have significantly increased levels of sTNF-R55,
   sE-selectin, LBP, and CRP compared with normometabolic patients. Weight
   loss was related with increased levels of the sTNF-Rs, sICAM-1, IL-6,
   LBP, and CRP.
   Conclusion: Hypermetabolism and weight loss are related to the presence
   of a systemic inflammatory response as reflected by enhanced levels of
   inflammatory mediators and acute phase proteins in patients with primary
   non-small cell lung cancer. (C) 1995 by American Society of Clinical

Abstract = {{THIS ARTICLE reports on two studies. In the first study, we investigated
   the development and role of phonological recoding in beginning reading,
   phonological recoding was measured as a set of skills that involves
   using systematic relationships between letters and phonemes to recognize
   or pronounce unknown printed strings (words and pseudowords), or to
   spell. One hundred and twenty children, age 5 to 8 were given a
   speech-to-print matching, a pseudoword reading, and a spelling task. The
   results indicated regular phases in phonological recoding prior to
   accuracy in reading simple pseudowords and a strong but changing
   relationship between these rudimentary skills and several reading tasks.
   In the second study, we investigated interrelationships with phoneme
   awareness that we measured as a hierarchy of skill in recognizing and
   segmenting phonemes in spoken words. A strong but changing relationship
   was found for the six measures of phoneme awareness with developmental
   phases in phonological recoding, with reading, and with spelling. The
   finding that phonological recoding and phoneme awareness are complex
   skills that develop gradually and reciprocally with reading and spelling
   indicates a need for multiple measures in research.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-state Pb-207 NMR spectra of lead(II) nitrate were found to be
   highly sensitive to variations in temperature. The Pb-207 chemical shift
   exhibits a linear dependence on temperature with a positive slope of
   0.70 +/- 0.02 ppm K-1, i.e. increases in temperature cause a change in
   chemical shift to higher frequency. This slope is within experimental
   error of the value obtained from parallel experiments on the static
   solid, 0.72 +/- 0.06 ppm K-1. At higher magic angle spinning (MAS)
   speeds and ambient probe temperature, the Pb-207 signal splits into
   several components owing to localized heating effects. These effects are
   more pronounced in rotors made from partially stabilized zirconia than
   those made from silicon nitride and are attributed to the poorer
   thermoconductive properties of the zirconia ceramic. In the zirconia
   rotors, discrete thermal regions within the lead(II) nitrate sample were
   located and differ by 5 K at 12 kHz MAS speeds. The response of the
   Pb-207 lead(II) nitrate signal to temperature variation suggests that it
   could be used for calibrating solid-state NMR probes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the structural controllability and observability of heat
   exchanger networks are determined from qualitative information about the
   heat exchangers and their network topology. The heat exchanger network
   is modelled as a time-varying linear system based on first engineering
   principles where the effect of the flowrate variations is described by
   unknown time-varying parameters, inlet temperature variations are
   regarded as disturbances and external heaters/coolers are considered as
   input variables. Necessary and sufficient conditions for structural
   controllability and observability of heat exchanger networks are
   derived, based on an extended Kalman-type rank criterion for linear
   systems with time-varying parameters. Determining the structural
   controllability and observability of heat exchanger networks needs only
   checks for the input and output connectability of the network in both
   constant and time-varying parameter cases. The results are extended to
   the more-practical case where bypass ratios are also used as control
   variables and where more than one time-varying parameter enters into the
   state-space matrices.}},

Abstract = {{A set of coordinate transformations is used to linearize a general

   inverse theory may be utilized. Consequently, important concepts, such
   as model parameter covariance, model parameter resolution and averaging
   kernels, may be carried over to non-linear inverse problems. I apply the
   approach to a set of seismic cross-borehole traveltimes gathered at the
   Conoco Borehole Test Facility. The seismic survey was conducted within
   the Fort Riley formation, a limestone with thin interbedded shales.
   Between the boreholes, the velocity structure of the Fort Riley
   formation consists of a high-velocity region overlying a section of
   lower velocity. It is found that model parameter resolution is poorest

   advent of the broad-spectrum oral fluoroquinolones, it is now possible
   to evaluate an initial empirical alternative therapy. A prospective
   randomized study was conducted comparing oral ciprofloxacin plus
   penicillin V (group A) with amikacin plus carbenicillin or ceftazidime
   (group B), Main criteria for eligibility were febrile patients with
   solid tumor or nonlymphoblastic lymphoma, a Zubrod PS equal to 1 or 2,
   no diarrhea, mucositis, or long-term central venous catheter. A total of
   108 consecutive neutropenic febrile episodes were randomized (5
   exclusions); 55 episodes were assigned to group A and 48 to group B.
   Most febrile episodes were of unknown origin. There were 10
   microbiologically documented episodes with two cases of bacteremia. Both
   regimens were well tolerated. Oral regimen was substantially cheaper
   than parenteral regimen. Treatment success without regimen modification
   was 94.5\% for group A and 93.8\% for group B (p =.86; CI -0.08-0.10).
   Oral therapy with ciprofloxacin and penicillin V is a safe alternative
   to standard parenteral therapy in this low-risk group of neutropenic
   patients, with unquestionable cost containment.}},

   colorectal carcinoma cells. Treatment of mice grafted with dispersed
   tumor cells, before formation of a tumor nodule, was started 1 day after
   s.c. injection of tumor cells and consisted of a single i.p. injection
   of murine 17-1A or 323/A3 mAb. Tumor appearance after a single injection
   of either 17-1A or 323/A3 was delayed as compared to injection of an
   irrelevant mAb. Both 17-1A and 323/A3 reduced the tumor growth rate, and
   both mAbs decreased the total number of mice that eventually developed a
   tumor, In all experiments, 323/A3 showed consistently better treatment
   effects on xenografted mice than mAb 17-1A. For treatment of established
   tumors with mAb 17-1A or 323/A3 therapy was delayed until a tumor nodule
   was macroscopically detectable, One single i.p. injection of mAb 17-1A
   had no effect on further tumor growth and mean tumor size as compared to
   the control group injected with irrelevant mAb, One single i.p.
   injection with mAb 323/A3 reduced the tumor growth rate in some mice
   with established tumors and resulted in a significant difference of mean
   tumor size of this group as compared to the 17-1A treated mice and the
   control groups, Multiple injections with mAb 17-1A also had no effects
   on established tumors, in contrast to mAb 323/A3, where serial
   injections resulted in tumor growth reduction and, eventually, in some
   mice reduction in tumor size, In summary, we showed that in nude mice
   mAb 323/A3 (Ka = 2 x 10(9) M(-1)) is much more potent than mAb 17-1A (Ka
   = 5 x 10(7) M(-1)) in eradication of nonestablished tumor cells and
   treatment of small established tumors. These results suggest that high
   affinity mAbs like 323/A3 might dramatically improve the clinical
   results obtained thus far with the low affinity mAb 17-1A in the
   adjuvant treatment of surgically resected Dukes C colorectal cancer
   patients with minimal residual disease.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy varying
   doses of recombinant human interleukin -6 (rhIL-6) after chemotherapy,
   Patients and Methods: In this phase I/II study, 19 breast (stage III to
   IV) or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients received mitoxantrone
   (10 mg/m(2)) and thiotepa (40 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks, followed by rhIL-6
   subcutaneously (days 5 to 15) at six dose levels: 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0,
   10.0, and 20.0 mu g/kg body weight/d (mu g/kg/d), rhIL-6 was increased
   to the next level in the individual patient in case of incomplete bone
   marrow recovery (leukocyte count < 3 x 10(9)/L and/or platelet count <
   100 x 10(9)/L at day 22) and/or platelet nadir less than 25 x 10(9)/L in
   two consecutive cycles.
   Results: Flu-like symptoms were observed in most of the patients. Nausea
   and vomiting were reported in seven of 48 and 19 of 48 cycles,
   respectively, Dose-limiting toxicity at 20.0 mu g/kg/d of rhIL-6
   consisted of World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 to 4 fly-like
   symptoms, nausea, and vomiting, Platelet recovery was faster in cycle 1
   at 10.0 and 20.0 mu g/kg/d of rhIL-6 than at lower dose levels (P <
   .05); thrombocytopenia grade 4 was observed at most levels. However,
   only two patients needed platelet transfusions (1.0 and 2.5 mu g/kg/d
   rhIL-6), rhIL-6 effects on leukocytes were not dose-related, with a
   trend for the neutrophil nadir to increase with rhIL-6 up to 10 mu
   g/kg/d, rhIL-6 dose escalation did not affect hematologic parameters and
   chemotherapy cycle duration. Hemoglobin (P < .001) and cholesterol (P <
   .05) levels decreased, while acute-phase proteins increased,
   Conclusion: rhIL-6 following chemotherapy is tolerable up to 10 mu
   g/kg/d; flu-like symptoms and nausea were dose-limiting at 20 mu g/kg/d
   Platelet nadir did not differ for the various rhIL-6 doses, However, a
   faster platelet recovery was observed at 10.0 and 20.0 mu g/kg/d of
   rhIL-6. (C) 1995 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.}},

Abstract = {{In the yeast Golgi compartments, at least five, and potentially several
   additional mannosyltransferases are involved in elongating to `mannan'
   the core Man(8)GlcNAc(2) oligosaccharide trimmed from
   Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) in the endoplasmic reticulum, Structural studies
   on oligosaccharides from alg3 mutant yeast, which lack the four upper
   arm mannoses donated by Man-P-Dol (where Dol is dolichol), verified that
   the new alpha 1,6-branch in endo H-resistant mannan in this strain is
   efficiently initiated in vivo on the alpha 1,3-linked core residue of
   the lipid-oligosaccharide form of Man(5)GlcNAc(2) (Verostek et al., J.
   Biol. Chem., 266, 5547-5551, 1991), This Man(5)GlcNAcGlcNAc{[}H-3]ol
   isomer (where GlcNAc{[}H-3]ol is N-acetylglucosamin {[}1-H-3] itol) was
   found to be an excellent acceptor for a number of GDP-Man-dependent
   Golgi mannosyltransferases in detergent-solubilized yeast membrane
   preparations: an alpha 1,3-mannosyltransferase (Mnn1p), an alpha
   1,6-mannosyltransferase (Och1p) and two alpha 1,2-mannosyltransferases
   (Mnt1p/Kre2p, ?) whose products were readily identified by H-1 NMR
   spectroscopy, The Man(6)GlcNAc-GlcNAc{[}H-3]ol isomers formed were
   easily defined by alpha 1,2-mannosidase sensitivity and either Bio-Gel
   P-4 gel filtration or AX-5 high-performance liquid chromatography, In
   general, mannosyltransferases present in detergent-solubilized
   microsomes from most yeast strains mimicked the array of sugar linkages
   observed on their respective glycoproteins, However, in the case of the
   Saccharomyces pmr1 mutant, an alpha 1,3-mannosyltransferase was active
   in microsomal extracts, but the alpha 1,3-Man epitope could not be
   identified on Western blots of cellular glycoproteins using sugar
   linkage-specific antibodies or lectins, The in vitro transferase assay
   is simple, rapid and accurate, and in the case of pmr1 suggests that in
   vivo either invertase is misrouted during secretion or the alpha
   1,3-mannosyltransferase is mistargeted after its synthesis in this
   mutant.}},

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Simple one-dimensional quasi-static heat transfer calculations can be
   used to estimate fast cookoff times of cylindrical munitions with metal
   cases. The most critical parameter for the thermal analysis is the heat
   flux to the ordnance from the fire. One must remain aware that heating
   will be different for transparent flames of propane or methane test
   fires than they are for the opaque smoky flames of wood and jet-fuel
   fires. Good values for material thermal conductivities and energetic
   material ignition behavior are also needed. Low-conductivity composite
   cases cannot be analyzed in the same way because case mechanical failure
   is the primary initial failure path, rather than thermal conduction
   leading directly to ignition of the energetic material. Reaction
   violence cannot be calculated in a simple way with the present state of
   the art.
   Simple hand analysis of slow cookoff problems is limited to simple
   symmetric shapes of the type that were published over 30 years ago
   involving constant boundary temperatures. Modem computers, using
   finite-difference codes can be used to readily solve problems with
   varying boundary temperatures to predict time to cookoff. However, as
   this paper shows, quasi-static solutions of symmetric shapes (slabs,
   cylinders and spheres) can be obtained with desktop computer
   spreadsheets that give the same results as the finite-difference codes.
   There are no a priori methods for predicting the violence of the slow
   cookoff reaction. These same comments apply as well to intermediate
   cookoff heating rates (greater than 3.3 K/h).
   Calculations by the methods of this paper place tools for designing
   experiments to explore cookoff behavior and for designing ordnance to
   meet insensitive munitions requirements on virtually every desktop.}},

   representations of the same information-could be used to determine one's
   direction of self-movement, sometimes called heading or aimpoint. In a
   series of 5 experiments, the relationship between these representations
   was explored and it was found that the displacements of identifiable
   objects, not their motions, are most likely the direct inputs for
   wayfinding. It may be that these inputs are used in conjunction with a
   mental map to determine one's aimpoint. A mathematical framework for
   this process is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{For the synthesis of {[}F-18]Fluoro-Org 6141 via a nucleophilic
   substitution reaction with F-18(-), the tosyl group was chosen as the
   leaving group because of its stability and excellent leaving group
   ability. The biodistribution of the high affinity and moderate
   lipophilicity (log P = 2.66, calculated value) ligand {[}F-18]Fluoro-Org
   6141 (specific activity 8.2 to 37 TBq/mmol, yield 10\% at EOB) was
   examined in sham adrenalectomized (sADX) and adrenalectomized (ADX) male
   Wistar rats. Two days after ADX or sADX, the animals were anesthetized
   acid 0.37 to 1.85 MBq of {[}F-18]Fluoro-Org 6141 was administered
   intravenously. Kinetics of F-18 activity uptake were monitored for 3 h
   using a stationary double-headed positron emission tomography (PET)
   camera, and the biodistribution was assessed by ex vivo determination of
   radioactivity in several tissues and different brain areas. One hour
   after injection of the radioligand, the bladder, kidney, liver, trachea,
   and bone of sADX animals contained more concentration on a wet weight
   basis than blood. Three hours post injection, radioactivity was retained
   in bladder, trachea, and bone. The accumulation of radioactivity in
   brain corresponded to the concentration of activity in the blood within
   the first hours after injection. ADX animals showed a higher uptake of
   F-18 activity in spleen, testes, and brain areas (hippocampus and
   brainstem) but a lower uptake in bone than sADX rats. PET scans
   suggested that F-18 activity uptake in the brain had not yet reached a
   maximum at this interval. Although {[}F-18]Fluoro-Org 6141 is not useful
   for PET studies of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), the results obtained
   with this compound indicate a synthetic strategy suitable for the
   synthesis of high-affinity radioligands for GRs.}},

   procedure was used to evaluate the potential of various methods for the

   Satisfactory results were obtained for glucovanillin extracted with a
   24-h Soxhlet extraction in 47.5\% ethanol and for vanillin with a 24-h
   extraction by maceration in 47.5\% ethanol or 80\% methanol. None of the
   tested methods correctly met the requirement for a quantitative and
   simultaneous extraction of both compounds. The slight underestimation of
   vanillin content by Soxhlet extraction could probably be overcome by
   modifying the extraction parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK) is a facility of the
   Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe GmbH (FZK) where, under the European Fusion
   Technology Program, experiments are performed on tritium technology for
   the nuclear fuel cycle with a view to the needs of the ITER fusion
   reactor. The Laboratory comprises conventional infrastructure systems,
   tritium infrastructure systems, and experiments on a floor area of
   approx. 1200 m(2). The licensed tritium quantity is at present 20 g; an
   application to increase this amount has been submitted to the
   corresponding authorities. The measures taken to safely handle such
   amounts of tritium are described in detail in this paper. Whereas the
   infrastructure is operated and controled from a central process control
   system (PLS), for the experiments local control systems (LLS) are used.
   Safety relevant signals are linked to a safety circuit. Some safety
   signals relevant to the operation of tritium systems are connected to
   the Central Emergency Control Center of the Research Center. Besides the
   operating, control and monitoring measures the safe operation of the
   Tritium Laboratory relies on highest quality standards, clear plant
   operation rules, a high degree of inherent safety and a number of
   tritium monitoring systems according to the latest state of the art.}},

Abstract = {{The order in the bilayers of a metastable gel state of the long-chain
   surfactant sodium sulfopropyl octadecyl maleate (SSPOM) is investigated
   by wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and molecular modeling. The WAXS
   patterns indicate an ordered and rather dense in-plane structure,
   consisting of hexagonally packed, untilted, and interdigitated
   molecules. Three hexagonal reflections are found for a 60 wt \% sample.
   Fourier analysis of the WAXS data reveals that the spatial correlation
   between the chains reaches almost 50 Angstrom. The estimated area per
   molecule in the bilayer is 40.0 Angstrom(2). Based on the experimental
   results, the in-plane packing is simulated and the hexagonal arrangement
   of molecules proves to be energetically possible. A model packing with
   the majority of the sodium counterions in the water phase near the SSPOM
   packing surface shows the best agreement with the experimental WAXS
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Applying different stresses (heat shock, photoinhibition, and chilling)
   to the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii led to a
   characteristic transcription pattern of mRNAs encoding ubiquitin
   extension proteins {[}0.7-kb transcript(s)] as well as polyubiquitin
   (2.3-kb transcript). Heat shock resulted in an increase in the amount of
   polyubiquitin mRNA (up to tenfold compared with control cells). Chilling
   in the light led to a sevenfold increase in the amount of 2.3-kb
   transcript and to a twofold increase in the amount of 0.7-kb mRNA(s),
   whereas a less pronounced effect on the level of the polyubiquitin
   transcript was observed after applying either chilling in darkness or
   photoinhibition. The latter stress, however, led to a dramatic decrease
   in mRNAs encoding ubiquitin extension proteins (down to 23\% of control
   cells). Experiments performed with a temperature-sensitive cell-cycle
   mutant of C. reinhardtii showed that the 2.3-kb polyubiquitin mRNA was
   no longer transcribed when cells were shifted to a non-permissive
   temperature, and thus were blocked in their vegetative cell cycle. This
   leads to the assumption that the expression of the corresponding gene is
   necessary for completion of the C. reinhardtii vegetative cell cycle.}},

   to automatize the reconstruction of animal flightpaths in a single-frame
   video film analysis. In addition to standard image-processing tools we
   employed a number of physical constraints as well as general knowledge
   to produce a system with acceptable performance. In this article we
   describe basic algorithms and techniques that provide a pragmatic
   solution in a specific case but that could in principle be applied to a
   large class of related problems. Our system copes with up to 5 degrees
   of freedom and a number of other variables such as brightness,
   illumination, object shape, occlusion and light reflection. We discuss
   the performance of a first implementation as well as remaining problems.}},

Abstract = {{Three pairs of cobble riffle study sites were established in a
   second-order stream in North Carolina and logs added to the downstream
   riffle at each site. At log addition transects, stream depth increased,
   current velocity decreased, cobble substratum was covered by sand and
   silt, and both coarse and fine particulate organic matter increased
   dramatically. Log additions had less dramatic effects on uptake lengths
   of ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate, but they had immediate and
   significant impacts on invertebrate community structure: abundances and
   biomass of scrapers and filterers decreased; collectors and predators
   increased; overall shredder biomass did not change, but biomass of
   trichopteran and dipteran shredders increased, while that of most
   plecopteran shredders decreased; and plecopteran predators also
   decreased despite greater abundances of potential prey. These
   observations suggest that physiological and morpho-behavioral
   constraints preclude many animals from tracking resources among patches
   when patches display very different abiotic conditions. Secondary
   production of scrapers and filterers decreased, whereas that of
   collectors and predators increased. The shifts in functional group
   abundances, biomass, and production between reference and debris-dam
   transects, which differed considerably from those previously reported
   for low-gradient, sandy-bottom streams, accentuate the importance of
   localized abiotic factors in structuring invertebrate communities within
   patches.}},

   education and training. The curriculum advocates integrating
   preservation administration into all facets of the management of
   archives. Moving archival preservation away from ad hoc decisions to
   well-planned management strategies is the program's underlying
   philosophy. The training assignments are also designed to build elements
   of a functioning, tailor-made archival preservation program for the
   student's employing institution prior to graduation. The SAA

Abstract = {{Employing flow cytometry and a monoclonal antibody against the murine
   macrophage antigen, Mac-1, we found a significant increase in the number
   of marrow macrophages in aged mice. This was reflected as significant
   increase with age in the number of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase
   positive cells, as well as in colony forming unit-macrophage (CFU-M)
   progenitor cells. Macrophages from the marrow of old mice generated
   significantly less tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) than did
   macrophages from young mice, either spontaneously or when activated by
   granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Furthermore,
   conditioned medium (CM) derived from either marrow or peritoneal
   macrophages of old mice caused less suppression of burst forming
   unit-erythroid (BFU-E) colony growth than did CM obtained from young
   mice. Aging, therefore, is associated with an in crease in the number of
   marrow macrophages that have an impaired ability to generate or release
   cytokines. The increase in macrophage number may reflect a compensation
   for their reduced function. Altered macrophage number and Junction may
   contribute to the age-related decline in hematopoietic reserve capacity.}},

   radical-initiated copolymerization of acrylamide with
   n-dodecylmethyldiallylammonium bromide as the hydrophobe in aqueous
   solution using ammonium persulfate as the initiator. The formation of
   hydrophobic microdomains of the copolymers was revealed by large
   hypsochromic shifts of the long-wavelength absorption band of the
   solvatochromic probe Methyl Orange, noncovalently bound to the
   macromolecule. It was found that the microdomains formed by these
   copolymers in aqueous solution are more hydrophobic than those of the
   cationic polysoaps poly(alkylmethyldiallylammonium halides) containing
   the same n-dodecyl groups as the side chains as a result of the reduced
   electrostatic repulsions at the periphery of the microdomains. The
   reduced cationic character of the copolymers Copol(AM-C12) most likely
   also accounts for the observation that the anionic dye Methyl Orange
   does not; induce microdomain formation in aqueous solution. The effect
   of the hydrophobically and electrostatically modified polyacrylamides on
   the unimolecular decarboxylation of 6-nitrobenzisoxazole-3-carboxylate
   anion (6-NBIC) has been investigated in aqueous solutions at pH 11.3 and
   30 degrees C. It is suggested that the relatively modest catalytic
   effects induced by Copol(AM-C12) should be ascribed to hydrogen-bond
   stabilization of the initial state by NH groups in the macromolecules.
   The decarboxylation rates of 6-NBIC at binding sites in hydrophobic
   microdomains increase with increasing n-dodecyl group content in the
   copolymers.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To assess the effect of right atrial appendage pacing on
   atrial electromechanical interrelations in patients with DDD pacemakers.
   Design-Prospective study by M mode echocardiogram, Doppler
   echocardiogram, and apexcardiogram, along with electrocardiogram and
   phonocardiogram.
   Setting-Tertiary cardiac referral centre.
   Patients-20 patients with DDD pacemakers and 20 age matched normal
   controls.
   Results-Age, RR interval, atrial size, left ventricular size, and
   fractional shortening were similar in the two groups. Atrial
   electromechanical delay (the time from the onset of P wave or atrial
   pacing spike on ECG to the onset of atrial contraction on M mode
   echogram) was 68 (SD 7) ms at the lateral site of right atrium, 82 (9)
   ms at the central fibrous body, 93 (11) ms at the lateral site of left
   atrium in normals. In patients with DDD pacing, however, this delay
   increased to 85 (22) ms, 117 (23) ms, and 138 (25) ms respectively (all
   P < 0.01). Interatrial mechanical delay (the time from the onset of
   right atrial motion to the onset of the left) increased from 25 (6) ms
   in normal controls to 53 (18) ms in patients (P < 0.01). Intra-atrial
   mechanical dispersion (the time from the earliest to the latest onset of
   regional atrial motion around the atrioventricular ring) in the right
   atrium increased from 6 (2) ms in normals to 19 (2)ms in patients (P <
   0.01), but it remained unchanged in the lek atrium (6 (2) ms in normal
   controls v 7 (2) ms in patients, P > 0.05). Peak atrial shortening rate
   was not different between the two groups. Differences of atrial
   electromechanical activity between the two groups were also reflected on
   Doppler echocardiogram and apexcardiogram.
   Conclusions-Right atrial appendage pacing disturbs the normal coordinate
   sequence of right atrial mechanical activity and leads to a striking and
   variable increase in intra-atrial conduction time as well as in
   interatrial conduction time. Left atrial contraction remains synchronous
   although the timing of the start of its contraction was delayed. These
   values can be determined in individual patients to allow optimal setting
   of DDD pacemakers.}},

   2-Ph was isolated, and a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals

   aldehydes favor addition. Addition of nonanal is more favorable than

Abstract = {{The paper summarizes the results of inhalation toxicology studies
   associated with para-aramid (p-aramid) fibrils. The review is subdivided
   into two categories: the results of inhalation toxicity studies and
   mechanistic inhalation studies. Keratin-associated lesions were observed
   in the lungs of female rats following chronic exposure to high
   concentrations of p-aramid. These lesions were originally interpreted as
   cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas (CKSCC). In recent years,
   this keratinizing lesion has been observed in the lungs of rats with
   greater regularity in numerous chronic inhalation studies following
   exposures to a variety of dusts. In an attempt to reach a consensus on
   an appropriate diagnosis for this lesion, an international panel of
   pathologists was convened to evaluate the morphological aspects of this
   lesion. The panel considered that the most appropriate diagnosis for
   this lesion was `proliferative keratin cyst' (PKC). the biological
   potential of the PKC remains controversial, but it appears to be unique
   to the rat species and has little relevance for humans. Mechanistic
   studies with p-aramid have demonstrated that acute inhalation of high
   concentrations of fibrils produces a potent but transient pulmonary
   inflammatory and cell labelling response. The inhaled fibrils have low
   durability in the lungs of rats as evidenced by a progressive decrease
   in median fibre lengths with increasing residence time in the lung. In
   contrast, in a comparative study, size-separated chrysotile asbestos
   produced a sustained increase over controls in cellular proliferation
   responses of terminal airways, parenchyma, subpleural and mesothelial
   regions. In addition, while the short fibres were cleared at a normal or
   rapid rate, the long (i.e. >5 mu m) chrysotile fibres were retained in
   the lung or cleared at a slow rate, suggesting that this subpopulation
   of fibres is durable in the lungs of exposed rats. These results point
   out the differences in the lung responses between p-aramid fibrils when
   compared to chrysotile asbestos fibres, namely, that chrysotile produced
   enhanced and sustained cell proliferation responses, and that the long
   chrysotile fibres were retained in the lungs of exposed rats.}},

Title = {{CYTOSKELETAL ARCHITECTURE OF RAT CALVARIAL OSTEOCLASTS - MICROFILAMENTS,
   INTERMEDIATE FILAMENTS, AND NUCLEAR MATRIX AS DEMONSTRATED BY DETERGENT
   PERFUSION}},
Journal = {{ANATOMICAL RECORD}},

Abstract = {{Background: There have been few detailed transmission electron
   microscopic studies of the cytoskeleton of osteoclasts to date because
   of the high electron density of their cytoplasmic matrix, and there is a
   controversy concerning the presence of stress fibers in these cells,
   Methods: The cytoskeleton and nuclear matrix of osteoclasts in the rat
   cranium were studied by transmission electron microscopy after perfusing
   the organs with a mixture of Triton X-100 and a low concentration of
   glutaraldehyde to reduce the electron density of the intracellular
   matrix and by immunoelectron microscopy using anti-actin and
   anti-vimentin antibodies.
   Results: In osteoclasts, abundant microfilaments, 5-6 nm in diameter,
   extended across the cell organelles. These filaments were also observed
   just under the cell membrane facing the bone, but thick bundles of
   microfilaments were not noted. In the cytoplasm, there were fibers 10-12
   nn in diameter, which were considered to be intermediate filaments
   distributed in the same pattern as microfilaments. Filamentous
   structures consisting both of the microfilaments and intermediate
   filaments connected the nuclei. Intermediate filaments linked nuclei at
   nuclear pores (near the euchromatin), and microfilaments connected
   nuclei at areas of the nuclear membrane containing nucleolus-associated
   heterochromatin. In the nuclear matrix after detergent treatment, thin
   filaments and intermediate-type filaments were found connecting the
   heterochromatins.
   Conclusions: Euchromatin is considered to be an active site of DNA and
   RNA synthesis. Our structural evidence has lead to the proposal that
   intermediate filaments in the cytoplasm may act as tracks for
   transmission of information between nuclei and guides for the transit of
   molecules through the pores. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of order-release planning for discrete parts manufacturing
   is addressed. Traditionally, order-release planning in a multi-stage
   shop is performed with material requirements planning (MRP) logic, which
   generally assumes that capacity is infinite and that lead times can be
   estimated using historical data, past experience, and general
   rules-of-thumb. These assumptions often result in infeasible plans. A
   new approach to order-release planning termed BACKSIM, that is based on
   discrete simulation, is proposed. With this approach, order-release
   plans are generated via a backward explosion logic similar to MRP except
   that a simulation model of the facility is used. Since the simulation
   model accurately captures real-world capacity constraints and
   operational rules, the order-release plans are theoretically feasible.
   Essentially, component lead times are calculated based on the
   anticipated queueing in the system each time BACKSIM is executed. A
   technique is developed that allows BACKSIM to be fairly compared with
   the MRP approach.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) on bench-scale activated
   sludge reactors and pilot-scale anaerobic and aerobic digesters was
   investigated, and a mass balance was performed using radiolabeled PDMS.
   Polydimethylsiloxane loadings of up to 10,000 mg kg(-1) dry weight of
   MLVSS had no effect on the maximum specific substrate utilization rate,
   half-saturation constant, endogenous decay coefficient, and cell yield
   in model activated sludge units. In addition, the operating parameters
   pH, suspended solids, sludge volume index, and specific oxygen uptake
   rate showed no difference between PDMS-loaded and control systems. A
   mass balance, in which C-14-labeled PDMS was added to bench-scale
   activated sludge systems, showed that essentially ail of the PDMS
   partitioned onto the microbial biomass. Pilot-scale aerobic and
   anaerobic digesters loaded with 100 mg kg(-1) PDMS showed no difference
   in pH and solids concentrations compared to control systems. In
   addition, PDMS-loaded aerobic digesters exhibited oxygen uptake rates
   equal to control systems; PDMS-loaded anaerobic digesters produced the
   same amount of gas as control digesters. These results show that PDMS
   behaves as an inert material with no significant effect on wastewater
   treatment processes (other than the expected benefit of foam control).}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development of the regular direct boundary
   element method for the analysis of plate bending problems. A number of
   case studies with square, rectangular, rhombic and parallelogram shaped
   plan forms, with different combinations of fixed, simply supported and

   of the regular method for plate bending analysis. The plates were
   analysed using quadratic elements and results for the distribution of
   displacement, slope, bending moment and shear force are presented for
   the various case studies. These results from the regular method with the
   source boundary removed from the actual boundary of the problem being
   analysed have been compared with either analytical results or with
   results from alternative numerical techniques. It was found that, in
   comparison to the singular version of the direct boundary element
   method, when the sources are distributed on the actual boundary of the
   problem being analysed, the regular method performs better with a
   particular improvement occurring at corners where two dissimilar
   boundary conditions meets.}},

Abstract = {{Site-specific agriculture uses maps to optimize within-field placement
   of agricultural practices. This technology introduces the potential to
   optimize pest management by varying pesticide or other inputs to better
   match within-field variation in pest density. Current sampling plans are
   designed to estimate mean density and may not be suitable for mapping,
   although useful sampling plans could be developed for map generation for
   integrated pest management. Using Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa
   decemlineata (Say), adults, larvae, and egg masses as model systems, the
   influence of the sample unit on map validity was explored. Adapting
   currently used sampling plans for potato integrated pest management by
   spatially referencing each sampled stem failed to resolve spatial
   dependence and resulted in maps with poor reliability. Increasing the
   sample unit improved resolution of spatial dependence and map
   reliability for each life stage. A distance-walk sample unit for adult
   and late instar Colorado potato beetles which has high potential for map
   generation is introduced. Using this sample unit, generalizations about
   Colorado potato beetle spatial dependence are made to discuss issues of
   developing sampling programs for map generation. An iterative process of
   sampling, spatial analysis, and error analysis is suggested for
   evaluating sample units for mapping pest density in high value crops.}},

Abstract = {{The persistent currents of few interacting electrons with spin in

   bands of the finite-width multi-channel ring are calculated with the
   transfer-matrix method including the interchannel coupling induced by

   shown that in the case of a narrow-width ring the electron-electron
   interaction and the confining potential build a rotating Wigner crystal
   of the few electrons, where the relative angular motions are harmonic
   oscillations if the impurity potential is weak. As long as this picture
   remains valid, the persistent current is not influenced by the
   electron-electron interaction. It is shown that the width of the
   mesoscopic ring is the critical parameter for the influence of the
   electron-electron interaction on the persistent current. With increasing
   width of the mesoscopic ring, the electron-electron interaction
   decreases the amplitude of the persistent current at low temperatures
   and increases it at higher temperatures. Further, for a finite width of

   results in the occurrence of higher harmonics in the persistent current.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic and Raman-type third-order susceptibilities chi((3)) of thin
   films of oligomeric paraphenylene vinylenes OPV-n (n = 1-5) were
   determined by nondegenerate four-wave-mixing techniques. These two
   contributions and third harmonic susceptibilities differ considerably
   with respect to their magnitude but show a similar increase with chain
   length. The different susceptibilities were calculated on the basis of a
   Huckel approach taking into account the increasing delocalization of pi
   electrons with chain length n. The ratios of the different contributions
   are quantitatively explained by a dominating electronic two-photon (TP)
   process due to a TP transition near 300 nm and by the Raman resonance of
   a vibrational mode at 1588 cm(-1) exhibiting most of the electron-phonon
   coupling strength (ECC mode).}},

Abstract = {{The extracellular matrix of the early sea urchin embryo is known to have
   an important functional role in morphogenesis and in the regulation of
   cell type specific gene expression. We have undertaken an immuno-cDNA
   screen to identify the constituents of the embryonic
   blastocoelic-extracellular matrix. Here we describe a newly identified
   member of the extracellular matrix that we have designated ECM 3. The
   transcript encoding ECM 3 is approximately 9.5 kb in length and partial
   DNA sequence contains no significant similarity to other sequences in
   the Genbank. This transcript is present in eggs and early embryos, and
   early in gastrulation the transcript accumulation increases
   approximately 25 fold. In situ RNA hybridization shows that the mRNA is
   present uniformly throughout eggs and early embryos, but beginning at
   mesenchyme blastula stage, RNA accumulation is selective to cells of the
   ectoderm except at the animal pole, where ECM 3 mRNA is greatly reduced.
   In this species, Lytechinus variegatus, the animal pole ectoderm is the
   site of fusion with the invaginating endoderm during formation of the
   mouth. In situ analysis of protein expression using a monospecific
   polyclonal antisera made against recombinant ECM 3 polypeptides shows
   that during gastrulation the ECM 3 protein accumulates selectively in
   the basal lamina and blastocoelar regions adjacent to the ectoderm in
   all regions except for the ectoderm at the animal pole. The ECM 3
   protein is not detected in other regions of the blastocoel e.g. adjacent
   to the endoderm. ECM 3 is also contributed maternally the ECM 3 protein
   is synthesized during oogenesis and stored in oocytes within
   membrane-bound vesicles in the vicinity of Golgi complexes. Following
   fertilization ECM 3 is selectively secreted basally into the nascent
   blastocoel. No accumulation is detected in apical regions of the
   blastomeres or in the hyaline layer/apical lamina. This newly described
   molecule of the extracellular matrix thus demonstrates expression
   regulated both by secretion and by cell type specific gene expression,
   and shows a correlation between a microenvironment of the extracellular
   matrix and a morphogenetic event.}},

Abstract = {{Brassicas in New Zealand are attacked by the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne
   brassicae (L.); the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer); and the
   larvae of Artogeia rapae (L.) and the diamondback moth, Plutella
   xylostella (L.). Use of prophylactic pesticides is the usual control
   strategy against such pests, but the invertebrate predatory community
   within fields can contribute to pest suppression. Larvae of New Zealand
   hover flies consume all of the above pests, but the requirement of the
   adult flies for pollen and nectar may limit their potential in fields
   where the noncrop flora is impoverished. In this work, parts of the
   borders of three cabbage fields were drilled with the annual plant P.
   tanacetifolia tanacetifolia Benth. (Hydrophyllaceae) as a pollen source
   in the spring. Four strips were alternated with 4 control strips
   (naturally occurring vegetation). Aphid and A. rapae populations were
   assessed weekly in unsprayed plots adjacent to the 8 replicated areas,
   and hover fly eggs were counted simultaneously. Hover fly adults were
   trapped in yellow pan traps that were arranged across the field in
   transects from each of the eight sampling areas. Border planting with P.
   tanacetifolia clearly affected numbers of adult hover flies and aphid
   populations. The potential for this type of habitat manipulation to
   increase diversity as a component of integrated pest management is
   discussed with reference to comparable research in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Three squirrel subpopulations were studied during a period of 35 months.
   The study areas were located in a commercial forest area of the western
   Wiehengebirge close to Osnabruck. The investigation was divided into a
   free range and a laboratory part. The squirrels were marked with a radio
   transmitter which was fixed around the neck. Thus the animals could be
   observed individually through periods between 3 and 12 months. The aim
   was to compare the ranges used by the squirrels in a large continuous
   forest area and in 2 isolated forest areas each of approximately 20 ha
   in size. The basis for this examination was the size of the home range
   and the core area by looking at the interindividual differences and
   those between groups. The mean home range size in the continuous forest
   was 11.1 ha (Concave Polygon Method), the average size of the core areas
   was 1.8 ha (Harmonic Mean Transformation). The mean home range size in
   the forest islands was 2.4 and 2.6 ha, the average size of the core
   areas 0.4 and 0.8 ha. The overlapping of home ranges was significantly
   higher in the forest islands than in the continuous forest. With the
   exception of 2 squirrels, female and male squirrels utilized their core
   habitats exclusively. Overlapping between home ranges could be seen for
   males and females. The number and location of the dreys was noted in the
   continuous forest. The average number of dreys per animal was 11. In
   winter the squirrels mostly used dreys in spruce trees. They were built
   close to the trunk. In summer, in contrast, they used dreys in pine
   trees. Here, they were mostly located in the branches. The whole day
   observations of these animals showed that there were differences in the
   tree species they used: the squirrels which preferred pine trees spent
   more time feeding and had shorter resting periods than those which
   preferred spruce seeds. The `'spruce squirrels'' had larger home ranges
   which they used more selectively for feeding while, the `'pine
   squirrels'' had smaller home ranges which they used more continuously.
   The animals in the Forest islands showed a more intense utilization of
   the home range, the core areas were larger compared to those of the
   squirrels in the continuous forest.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient interface conditions (EICs) are derived for the propagation
   equation using the slowly varying envelope approximation for the
   dominant electric field component. At the interface between two
   different media, the two lateral second derivatives in the discretized
   propagation equation are adapted such that the discretized modal field
   equation is correct up to second order in the lateral grid spacing.
   Since the error term is then of the order of the lateral grid spacing,
   our EICs are first-order EICs. These interface conditions are compared
   with well-known zero-order EICs derived by Stern and Kim and Ramaswamy.
   It is shown that the first-order EICs yield faster convergence to the
   exact effective index value as the lateral grid spacing is decreased
   than do the zero-order EICs. It turns out that our EICs are very much
   like those derived by Vassallo. Using essentially the same method, he
   derived EICs of second and first order for the field component
   respectively parallel and perpendicular, to the interface. Hence the
   accuracy of his EICs is one order higher for the field component
   parallel to the interface, although it introduces an extra asymmetry in
   the propagation matrix.}},

   Pneumocystis carinii(PC) pneumonia (PCP) was assessed in a PC-infected

   an anti-CD40L mAb to block CD40L. SCID mice infected with PC were
   reconstituted with unfractionated spleen cells from immunocompetent
   donors and given either anti-CD40L mAb or an irrelevant control mAb.
   Mice given the control mAb resolved the PC infection, whereas those
   given the anti-CD40L mAb did not. That anti-CD40L mAb also inhibited
   PC-specific IgG production is consistent with the possibility that
   cognate CD4(+) T cell-B cell interactions are important in PCP
   resolution, The experiment was then repeated, except that the
   PC-infected SCID mice were reconstituted with purified CD4(+) T cells
   only, Again, the control mAb-treated group resolved the PCP, whereas
   mice treated with anti-CD40L mAb did not. In the second experiment,
   inhibition of resolution of PCP in the anti-CD40L mAb group was not the
   result of blocking CD4(+) T cell-dependent activation of PC-specific B
   cells. The results are consistent with the possibility that resistance
   to PCP may involve interaction between B cells and CD4(+) T cells via
   the CD40-CD40L pathway. However, results additionally indicate that
   inhibition of CD40-CD40L interaction ablates resistance to PCP by
   inhibiting the interaction of T cells with some cell other than B cells.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years much has been written about the state of papers in
   libraries and the causes for their ageing and embrittlement. It is
   demonstrated that the main cause for this is the exogenous influence

   in engine sizing.
   Two essential influencing variables which have not been evaluated
   appropriately up to now are described in the following.
   1. The use of mineral acids in papermaking mainly in the period between
   about 1840-1955.
   2. The influence of variations in climatic conditions when storing paper
   and the handling mechanism for ionogenic substances to be found in the

Abstract = {{Envenomation by the brown recluse spider (loxoscelism) is classically
   associated with a necrotic ulcer. Systemic manifestations occur in a
   minority of cases, but are generally mild and self-limited. The
   hematologic complications of brown recluse spider bite range from mild
   hemolysis to fulminant intravascular hemolysis with or without evidence
   of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Intravascular hemolysis is a
   rare but occasionally lethal complication of brown recluse spider
   envenomation. This article presents two cases of severe hemolysis
   associated with loxoscelism occurring in two young women in Memphis,
   Tennessee. The second documented death in an adult from severe hemolysis
   due to a brown recluse spider bite is reported. A review of the
   literature emphasizing the pathogenic mechanisms of spider bite
   hemolysis is also included.}},

Abstract = {{For a better understanding of the processes that lead to the activation
   or inhibition of type VI collagen synthesis, we have identified and
   characterized the cis-acting elements of the chicken alpha 2(VI)
   collagen promoter. This promoter encompasses four sites, termed S1, S2,
   X and S3, which interact with nuclear factors. Sites S1, S2 and S3 are
   each recognized by the same two proteins that belong to the Spl
   multigene family. Site X appears to interact with a novel transcription
   factor of 43 kDa. When a fragment containing all four of the elements is
   placed in front of a reporter gene, the resulting construct is able to
   induce a high level of transcription in chicken fibroblasts. As soon as
   a single element is deleted from this construct, the activity decreases
   drastically. Thus, the four elements are essential for the
   transcriptional activation of the ct 2 (VI) collagen gene.}},

Abstract = {{Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) expressing the CD30 antigen is an
   uncommon subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma characterized by distinct
   morphological and clinical features. The recurrent chromosomal
   abnormality found in these tumours is a t(2;5)(p23;q35) which has been
   detected in a minority of these cases, predominantly with a T cell
   immunophenotype. We report here a CD30 positive null cell type ALCL case
   cytogenetically characterized by a new type of t(2;5) translocation with
   distinct breakpoints at 2q37 and 5q31. FISH with a panel of 5q specific
   DNA probes applied in this case allowed for a mapping of a 5q31
   breakpoint region between the locus for IL-3 (proximally) and CI5-56
   probe (distally). These results point to a localization of unknown
   gene(s) on the long arm of chromosome 5 that, in addition to the NPM
   gene at 5q35, may be involved in the pathogenesis of some CD30+ ALCL.}},

Abstract = {{The successful genetic manipulation of Clostridium acetobutylicum for
   the increased production of solvents will depend on an understanding of
   gene structure and regulation in the bacterium. The glutamine synthetase
   (glnA) gene is regulated by antisense RNA, transcribed from a downstream
   promoter, in the opposite direction to the glnA gene. An open reading
   frame (ORF) was detected downstream of the glnA gene, which has sequence
   homology to response regulators with anti-termination activity and may
   be involved in sensing nitrogen conditions. The expression of the linked
   beta-hbd, adh1 and fixB genes was investigated throughout the bacterial
   growth cycle by RNA hybridisation techniques. The adhl gene was
   independently expressed as a 2.4-kb transcript which peaked at 12 h,
   immediately prior to the solventogenic phase. The beta-hbd and fixB
   genes were transcribed throughout the acidogenic and solventogenic
   phases. A regulator gene, regA, which complements a Bacillus subtilis
   ccpA mutant, has been identified and sequenced from C. acetobutylicum
   P262. The regA gene repressed the degradation of starch by an
   uncharacterised C. acetobutylicum gene, and may therefore play a role in
   the utilisation of carbohydrate substrates in this organism.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the effect of mild head injury in preschool
   children on aspects of their cognitive performance in the year after
   injury and at the age of 6.5 years, with particular reference to the
   development of reading skills. Mild head injury was defined by diagnosis
   at a hospital emergency department of a head injury which was not severe
   enough to need admission for observation. Seventy eight such children
   were compared with a group of 86 with a minor injury elsewhere. The
   groups had similar developmental, family, and socioeconomic status.
   There were no differences in cognitive tests soon after the injury, but
   at six months and one year children with mild head injury scored less
   than controls on one test, solving a visual puzzle (visual closure);
   they were also more likely to have had another mild head injury. At 6.5
   years of age they still scored less than controls, reading ability was
   related to their visual closure score at one year, and they were more
   likely to have needed help with reading.
   Mild head injury seems to be able to produce subtle but significant
   changes which can affect school performance.}},

Abstract = {{A gastroenteritis results when Clostridium perfringens is ingested in

   Since the organism must pass through the stomach, its ability to form
   spores may be affected by the acidic environment. Five strains of C.
   perfringens were exposed to acidic conditions and then assessed for
   survival and their ability to form spores. An acidic pH environment
   kills the bacteria over time but surviving cells are able to recover and
   form spores. Two of the five strains demonstrated enhanced sporulation
   following a 30-min exposure to a pH 2 environment. For four of the
   strains tested, enterotoxin concentrations were higher from acid-exposed
   cells than from untreated cells. Exposure to a pH 3.5 environment did
   not affect sporulation when compared to an untreated control. Bacteria
   in the stationary phase of growth were the most able to resist the acid
   and sporulate. The results indicate that some strains will produce more
   spores and enterotoxin following exposure to an acidic environment. (C)

Abstract = {{Based on a random sample of size n from an unknown density f on the real
   line, the nonparametric estimation of theta(k) =
   integral\{f((k))(x)\}(2) dx, k = 0, 1,..., is considered. These
   functionals are important in a number of contexts. The proposed
   estimates of theta(k) is constructed in the frequency domain by using
   the sample characteristic function. It is known that the sample
   characteristic function at high frequency is dominated by sample
   variation and does not contain much information about f. Hence, the
   variation of the estimate can be reduced by modifying the sample
   characteristic function beyond some cutoff frequency, It is proposed to
   select adaptively the cutoff frequency by a generalization of the
   (smoothed) cross-validation. The exact convergence rate of the proposed
   estimate to theta(k) is established. It depends solely on the smoothness
   of f. For sufficiently smooth f, it is shown that the proposed estimate
   is asymptotically normal, attains the optimal O-p(n(-1/2)) rate and
   achieves the information bound. Finally, to improve the performance of
   the proposed estimate at small to moderately large n, two modifications
   are proposed. One modification is for estimating theta(o); it reduces
   bias of the estimate. The other modification is for estimating theta(k),
   K greater than or equal to 1; it reduces sample variation of the
   estimate. In simulation studies the superior performance of the proposed
   procedures is clearly demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Determination of macroscopic and microscopic distribution of
   general anesthetics can facilitate identification of anatomic, cellular,
   and molecular loci of anesthetic action. Previous attempts to measure
   brain anesthetic distributions with fluorine-19 (F-19) nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) imaging were conducted at magnetic field strengths lower
   than 2 Tesla. All have produced only silhouettes of brain tissue.
   Difficulties intrinsic to NMR imaging of anesthetics include higher
   anesthetic solubility in extracranial tissues and the lower limits to
   spin-echo delay times that can be used in conventional NMR imaging
   methods. So far, such methods have been unable to capture rapidly
   decaying brain F-19 NMR signals.
   Methods: F-19 NMR imaging and spectroscopy were conducted at 4.7 Tesla
   using a specially developed NMR probe and new imaging methods, With the
   new techniques, it was possible to observe directly the uptake,
   distribution, and elimination in brain of sevoflurane, a fluorinated
   general anesthetic with special advantages for NMR investigations.
   Results: F-19 NMR images, acquired at different times after sevoflurane
   administration, clearly showed the distribution of a fluorinated general
   anesthetic within the brain. Based on continuous transverse relaxation
   time measurements, sevoflurane signals could be separated into two
   components, attributable respectively to sevoflurane in a mobile or
   immobile microenvironment. During washin, there was a delayed
   accumulation of anesthetic in the mobile microenvironment. During
   washout, there was a rapid elimination from the immobile
   microenvironment.
   Conclusions: At anesthetizing concentrations, sevoflurane distributes
   heterogeneously in the brain. Sevoflurane in the brain tissue
   contributes mostly to the immobile component of the F-19 signal, whereas
   that in the surrounding adipose and muscle tissues contributes mostly to
   the mobile component. Imaging and spectroscopic results suggest that the
   immobile component of sevoflurane is associated with the general
   anesthetic effects of the agent.}},

Abstract = {{The superinduction of the polyamine catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine
   N-1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) has been implicated in the cell
   type-specific cytotoxic activity of some polyamine analogues. We now
   report that one polyamine analogue, 1, 12-dimethylspermine (DMSpm),
   produces a large induction of SSAT with no significant effects on growth
   in the human large cell lung carcinoma line, NCI H157. This cell line
   has been demonstrated to respond to other analogues with SSAT
   superinduction and cell death. Treatment of the lung cancer cell line
   with DMSpm produces a rapid increase in SSAT activity and a near
   complete depletion of the natural polyamines. Additionally, DMSpm
   supports cell growth in cells which have been depleted of their natural
   polyamines by the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor,
   2-difluoromethylornithine. The current results suggest that significant
   induction of SSAT can occur in the absence oi cytotoxicity when the
   inducing polyamine analogue can support growth and that increased SSAT
   activity alone is not sufficient for cytotoxicity to occur. (C) 1995

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{121}},

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated previously that the polysialic acid (PSA) moiety of
   the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) can regulate peripheral nerve
   branching during development. In particular, it was found that specific
   enzymatic removal of PSA from motor axons causes them to form tight
   fascicles that are less responsive to normal guidance cues. In the
   present study, the role of PSA in the behavior of axons in the central
   nervous system has been examined through an analysis of chick optic
   axons during development. Unlike peripheral axons, which generally grow
   in a PSA-free environment, PSA was found to be present both on retinal
   ganglion cell axons and their environment in the tract and tectum.
   Furthermore, the enzymatic removal of PSA from the optic axons caused
   them to defasciculate in the tract/tectal region. This response was
   morphologically similar to targeting corrections made by these axons at
   a later stage when PSA levels have decreased, suggesting that the PSA
   may serve to shield them from responding prematurely to some guidance
   cues in their target region.}},

   tumor, were mainly affected by mean DNA indices of the nuclei of SG2M
   phase tumor cell (including S phase and G2M phase cells) (SG2M DNA
   indices) and that mean DNA indices correlated with the SG2M phase
   fraction. The SG2M DNA indices and the percentage of tumor cells with S
   phase and G2M phase were higher in high grade gliomas including
   anaplastic glioma and glioblastoma multiforme than in low grade gliomas.
   Patients with G2M-hypertetraploid tumors demonstrated a shorter time to
   tumor progression than those with G2M-tetraploid in high grade glioma.
   Morphometrically, the nuclei of SG2M phase glioma cells were larger and
   more deformity than those of G0G1 phase (including GO phase and G1 phase
   cells) cells. The G2M-hypertetraploid tumors were highly malignant and
   demonstrated large nuclei, greater nuclear deformity, and a higher
   proliferative potential. The G2M-tetraploid gliomas demonstrated a
   shorter time to tumor progression in cases whose the SG2M fraction was
   large. In contrast, G2M-hypotetraploid gliomas revealed an insignificant
   trend towards a longer time to tumor progression than those associated
   with tetraploid and hypertetraploid gliomas. We emphasize herein the
   prognostic importance of the SG2M phase cell, as well as other

   {[}phenoxyphenyl-C-14]-pyriproxyfen at doses of 2 and 1000 mg/kg. The
   carbon-14 was excreted almost completely into urine and feces within 7

   84-97\% and 4-12\% of the dose in rats and 64-91\% and 9-38\% in mice.
   Major metabolic reactions of pyriproxyfen were (1) hydroxylation at the
   4-position of the terminal phenyl ring, (2) hydroxylation at the
   a-position of the terminal phenyl ring, (3) hydroxylation at the
   5-position of the pyridyl ring, (4) dephenylation, (5) cleavage of ether
   Linkages, and (6) conjugation of the resultant phenols with sulfuric

   200 degrees C) was studied as a function of post-irradiation annealing
   at 165 degrees C. Computerized glow peak analysis shows that the order
   of kinetics of peak 5 increases from 1.2 +/- 0.05 (1 SD) following 165
   degrees C annealing for five minutes to 1.72 +/- 0.07 (1 SD) following
   annealing at 165 degrees C for thirty minutes. Extrapolation of the
   results to zero annealing time yields a value of kinetic order
   consistent with unity. The glow curve analysis also indicates that peak
   4 (the satellite peak at approximately 175 degrees C) is undetectable
   even at the lowest annealing duration of 5 minutes. The high temperature
   satellite of peak 5 (peak 6 at approximately 225 degrees C) grows with
   increasing annealing time to 10\% of the intensity of peak 5 after
   annealing for 30 min. Glow curve analysis including peak 6, however,
   does not significantly change the conclusions regarding the increase in
   the order of kinetics of peak 5 as a function of annealing time or the
   consistency of the extrapolated results with kinetic order unity at zero
   annealing time. Analysis ofisothermal decay curves at 165 degrees C
   shows that the relative intensity of peak 4 to peak 5 decreases with
   increasing annealing time, from 8\% after 5 min annealing to 0.5\% after
   30 min annealing.}},

Title = {{P53 PROTEIN ACCUMULATION IN TUMORS OF THE AMPULLA OF VATER}},

Abstract = {{Background. Accurate preoperative diagnosis of tumors of the ampulla of
   Vater is difficult because ampullary biopsies have a high false-negative
   rate. Recently, it has been suggested that p53 mutations in tumors of
   the ampulla of Vater are associated with the transformation of adenomas
   and low grade carcinomas to high grade carcinomas. The purpose of this
   study was to determine the extent of p53 protein accumulation in tumors
   of the ampulla of Vater, and to determine whether p53 accumulation can
   be detected in false-negative biopsies.
   Methods. Using a monoclonal anti-p53 antibody, sections of 4 normal
   ampullas, 5 adenomas, 17 carcinomas, and 9 initial biopsies of 9 of the
   tumors of the ampulla of Vater that had no morphologic evidence of
   carcinoma were immunostained.
   Results. None of the 4 normal ampullas (0\%), 2 of 5 adenomas (40\%),
   and 16 of 17 carcinomas (94\%) were positive for p53. This p53
   positivity was present through all stages of ampullary carcinoma. Of the
   nine initial biopsies negative for carcinoma, seven were positive for
   p53 and, of these, six (86\%) were found to be carcinomas upon
   resection.
   Conclusions. 1) The molecular events leading to p53 accumulation in
   tumors of the ampulla of Vater occur early in the neoplastic process. 2)
   Tumors of the ampulla of Vater with biopsies negative for malignancy but
   positive for p53 are very likely to be carcinomas.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of canthaxanthin (CX), a non-provitamin A carotenoid, on
   gastric epithelial proliferation was studied in ferrets colonized with
   Helicobacter mustelae, which causes a chronic gastritis and an increased
   gastric epithelial cell proliferation. Seven spayed female ferrets were
   dosed by gavage with CX beadlets (50 mg/kg body wt, 5 d/wk) over 2 y,
   whereas seven control animals were given placebo beadlets, At the end of
   the 2-y-period, ferrets were killed, and gastric tissues were obtained
   from the antrum and body regions. A cell-proliferating biomarker,
   proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), was assayed by
   immunohistochemistry, The PCNA positivity was measured by a
   computer-based image analysis system. Serum concentrations of
   carotenoids, retinoids and tocopherols were analyzed by HPLC. Serum
   antioxidant status was measured by the oxygen radical absorbance
   capacity (ORAC) assay. The PCNA positivity in both antrum and body
   regions was not significantly different between CX-fed ferrets and
   controls. Serum CX concentrations were significantly higher in CX-fed
   ferrets vs. controls (P < 0.001), whereas levels of other carotenoids,
   retinoids and tocopherols were not significantly different. The ORAC
   values were not significantly different between groups. This study does
   not suggest inhibitory effects of CX on gastric epithelial cell
   proliferation in H, mustelae infected ferrets.}},

   RELIEF - A 10-YEAR PROSPECTIVE-STUDY}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the experience gained using World Health
   Organization Guidelines for cancer pain relief over a 10-year period in
   an anaesthesiology-based pain service associated with a palliative care
   programme. The course of treatment of 2118 patients was assessed
   prospectively over a period of 140,478 treatment days. Non-opioid
   analgesics (WHO step I) were used on 11\%, weak opioids (WHO step II) on
   31\% and strong opioids (WHO step III) on 49\% of treatment days.
   Administration was via the enteral route on 82\% and parenterally on 9\%
   of treatment days. On the remaining days, either spinally applied
   opioids (2\%) or other treatments (6\%) were utilised. Fifty-six percent
   of the patients were treated with morphine. Morphine dose escalation was
   observed in about one-half of the patients being cared for until death,
   whereas the other half had stable or decreasing doses over the course of
   treatment. Co-analgesics were administered on 37\% of days, most often
   antidepressants (15\%), anticonvulsants (13\%) and corticosteroids
   (13\%). Adjuvants to treat symptoms other than pain were prescribed on
   79\% of days, most commonly laxatives (42\%), histamine-2-receptor
   antagonists (39\%) and antiemetics (35\%). In addition, palliative
   antineoplastic treatment was performed in 42\%, nerve blocks in 8\%,
   physiotherapy in 5\%, psychotherapy in 3\% and TENS in 3\% of patients.
   A highly significant pain reduction was achieved within the Ist week of
   treatment (P < 0.001). Over the whole treatment period, good pain relief
   was reported in 76\%, satisfactory efficacy in 12\% and inadequate
   efficacy in 12\% of patients. In the final days of life, 84\% rated
   their pain as moderate or less, while 10\% were unable to give a rating.
   Analgesics remained constantly effective in all 3 steps of the WHO
   ladder. Other clinical symptoms were likewise significantly reduced at 1
   week after initial assessment, with the exception of neuropsychiatric
   symptoms. During the course of treatment, the latter were the major
   symptoms on 23\% of days, followed by nausea (23\%), constipation (23\%)
   and anorexia (20\%). Our results emphasise once again the marked
   efficacy and low rate of complications associated with oral and
   parenteral analgesic therapy as the mainstay of pain treatment in the
   palliative care of patients with advanced cancer. Wide dissemination of
   WHO guidelines among doctors and healthcare workers is thus necessary to
   effect a clear improvement in the treatment of the many patients
   suffering from cancer pain in the clinical and home setting.}},

Abstract = {{Gliding bacterial adjuvant (GBA) has been previously characterized as a
   potent immune modulator, stimulating the growth of murine B lymphocytes,
   inducing murine NK cell activity, and promoting the release of several
   murine cytokines. Based on these studies and our interest in
   potentiating the effectiveness of feline vaccines, GBA was tested for
   its ability to stimulate feline T cells in vitro and act as a vaccine
   adjuvant in vivo. In vitro, GBA stimulated feline PBLs to proliferate
   and release interferon (IFN) and IL-2. Unlike IFN, the release of IL-2
   appeared to be unaffected by prior depletion of macrophages, indicating
   GBA directly stimulated feline T cells. In vivo GBA was co-administered
   with Keyhole Limpet Hemacyanin (KLH) and the anti-KLH antibody response
   was compared to cats receiving KLH emulsified in complete Freund's
   adjuvant (CFA). Fourteen days after the third immunization and
   continuing for a 30-day observation period KLH-specific IgG titers in
   cats receiving GBA were significantly higher than those given CFA.
   However, when cats were subsequently boosted with KLH alone, those cats
   receiving CFA demonstrated significantly higher antibody titers
   throughout a second 30-day observation period The anti-KLH antibody
   memory response was greatly enhanced when GBA was emulsified with
   incomplete Freunds adjuvant (IFA) prior to injection. Serum titers of
   cats given KLH in an oil-based GBA preparation were significantly higher
   than cats receiving KLH adjuvanted with IFA or CFA, an effect which
   persisted 38 days after boosting with KLH alone. Finally, GBA
   significantly enhanced the feline humoral response to a recombinant
   protein of Dirofilaria immitis, the causative agent of feline heartworm.
   Serum titers of cats inoculated with recombinant antigen in GBA were
   significantly greater than cats given recombinant antigen adjuvanted
   with Titermax(R), alum, or NAGO. These studies indicate that GBA induces
   T cell proliferation and the release of IL-2 and IFN in vitro and can be
   used to enhance the recall antibody response to both a T cell dependent
   antigen and art immunogen derived from Dirofilaria immitis.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of La3+ on LLC-PK1 cells was investigated by ion microscopy,
   a mass spectrometry-based technique with a spatial resolution of similar
   to 0.5 mu m. Cells were incubated with LaCl3 for 10 min (1 mM) or 30 min
   (0.1 mM), and intracellular calcium distributions were measured with a
   Cameca IMS-3f ion microscope in cryogenically prepared cells. Compared
   with control cells, La3+ reduced total calcium in the Golgi complex by >
   100 mu M in both treatments, whereas other cellular regions, such as the
   nucleus and cytoplasm, remained largely unchanged. These two treatments
   were repeated on cells that were preincubated with 1 mM ouabain. The
   presence of ouabain in the medium increased the loss of calcium from the
   Golgi by about fourfold compared with the treatments without ouabain.
   The La3+ effect, therefore, was amplified by ouabain-induced Na+
   loading, indicating a possible involvement of a Na+/La3+ exchanger. La3+
   was detected within cells and its influx was facilitated by Na+ loading.
   These results suggest that La3+ may affect cellular calcium homeostasis
   by actions other than as a simple Ca2+ antagonist.}},

   the variety of the presenting symptoms in patients suffering from

   rupture. A 41-year old second gravida, first para - the healthy
   full-term child was delivered by Caesarean section - suffered a
   `'silent'' uterus rupture after termination of pregnancy at 20th/21st
   weeks' gestation. As more than 50 per cent of patients with `'silent''
   uterus rupture are diagnosed with considerable delay, early and repeated
   ultrasound examinations should be performed in all patients with
   unexplained symptoms or if despite abortion induction for several days
   no progression of birth occurs. In an artificially induced abortion,
   prostaglandins should be topically applied to enhance cervix ripening,
   preferably as a biphasic treatment (first for cervix ripening, later
   induction of contractions). It is not yet clear whether a single or
   total dose reduction of prostaglandins used in labour induction in the
   second trimenon may help to prevent uterus rupture in patients at risk.
   Predisposing risk factors must be taken into account before applying
   prostaglandins. Uterus rupture should always be considered as
   differential diagnosis if problems occur in patients after induced
   abortion in the second trimenon.}},

Abstract = {{Three experiments addressed the role of phonological information in
   visual word recognition using a letter search task. Subjects were
   presented with a target letter (e.g., `'I'') followed by a letter string
   (a word, a pseudohomophone, a pseudoword control, or a nonword). Their
   task was to indicate whether the target letter was present in the letter
   string. All experiments presented pseudohomophones (e.g., TAIP or BRANE)
   that either contained a letter (I) that was absent in their sound-alike
   word (TAPE) or were missing a letter (I) that was present in their
   sound-alike word (BRAIN). In Experiments 1 and 2, subjects made more
   miss errors under data-limited conditions when the letter string was a
   target-present pseudohomophone (TAIP) and more false alarm errors when
   the letter string was a target-absent pseudohomophone (BRANE).
   Experiment 2 controlled for a possible confound in the data in terms of
   word completion strategies. In Experiment 3, we replicated the
   pseudohomophone disadvantage using resource-limited conditions:
   detection times were longer for pseudohomophones. The existence of a
   pseudohomophone disadvantage in a supposedly graphemic task adds further
   support to the accumulating evidence that phonological information
   generated from the printed word is an early and major constraint in
   visual word recognition. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{An iterative predictor-corrector finite-difference time-domain method is
   used to solve the semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch system numerically without
   invoking any of the standard approximations such as the rotating-wave
   approximation. This approach permits a more exact study of self-induced
   transparency effects in a two-level atom. In addition to recovering the
   standard results, for instance, for pi, 2 pi, and 4 pi pulses, several
   features in the results appear at the zeros of the driving pulse, where
   its time derivatives are maximum. Several ultrafast-pulse examples
   demonstrate that time-derivative-driven nonlinearities have a
   significant impact on the time evolution of a two-level atom system.
   Moreover, typical small-signal gain results are also obtained with our
   Maxwell-Bloch simulator. We illustrate that these time-derivative
   effects can be used to design an ultrafast, single-cycle pump pulse that

Abstract = {{Neonatal vulnerability to intracranial hemorrhage is often attributed to
   a relative inability of immature cerebral arteries to contract. Because
   this depressed contractility may involve age-related differences in
   cerebrovascular calcium handling, the present study examined age-related
   differences in cerebral artery contractility and its dependence on
   extracellular calcium from 24 newborn lambs and 36 adult sheep.
   Contractile tensions and Ca-45 uptakes were measured under baseline
   conditions and as a function of time during stimulation by both
   receptor-dependent (100 mu M serotonin) and receptor-independent (122 mM
   K+) mechanisms of contraction in endothelium denuded newborn (N) and
   adult (A) ovine middle cerebral (MCA) and common carotid (COM)arteries.
   Maximum contractile responses to potassium averaged 4.5 +/- 0.2 (N-COM),
   5.8 +/- 0.9 (A-COM), 3.0 +/- 1.1 (N-MCA), and 3.1 +/- 0.6 (A-MCA) g.
   Corresponding averages for responses to serotonin were 7.2 +/- 0.8, 7.3
   +/- 1.1, 3.6 +/- 0.1, and 3.6 +/- 0.2; except for COM responses to
   potassium, contractile responses were little affected by maturation in
   either artery type. At baseline, uptakes averaged 0.39 +/- 0.04 (N-MCA),
   0.33 +/- 0.04 (A-MCA), 0.25 +/- 0.03 (N-COM), and 0.14 +/- 0.01 (A-COM)
   mu mol Ca/g dry weight/min. Maximum increases in calcium uptake produced
   by potassium depolarization averaged 231 +/- 19\% (N-MCA), 152 +/- 13\%
   (A-MCA), 156 +/- 11\% (N-COM), and 140 +/- 14\% (A-COM) above baseline.
   Corresponding spending increases produced by 100 mu M serotonin averaged
   201 +/- 15\% (N-MCA), 129 +/- 23\% (A-MCA), 143 +/- 20\% (N-COM), and
   145 +/- 18\% (A-COM). Under all conditions examined, calcium uptakes
   were uniformly greater in newborn than adult arteries, and were greater
   in MCA than COM segments of the same age. For equivalent contractile
   tensions, newborn arteries required greater calcium uptakes than
   corresponding adult arteries. We attribute these differences largely to
   age-related variations in the activation of calcium entry through
   voltage-sensitive and receptor-operated membrane calcium channels.}},

Abstract = {{To be consistent, censored data linear regression estimators typically
   require a correctly specified linear regression function and independent
   and identically distributed errors. For uncensored data one can assess
   these model assumptions informally by examining plots of the residuals
   against the independent variables or fitted values. In this paper I
   propose plots for censored data analogous to these uncensored data
   residual plots. One can use such plots in the same way as their
   uncensored data counterparts for checking model assumptions; if the
   model assumptions are correct, then the plots should exhibit a random
   scatter. I show that the proposed plots are useful in selecting a linear
   regression model for the Stanford heart transplant data.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of passage rotation on the gasdynamic wave processes is
   analyzed through a numerical simulation of ideal shock-tube flow in a
   closed rotating-channel containing a gas in an initial state of
   homentropic solid-body rotation. Relevant parameters of the problem such
   as wheel Mach number, hub-to-tip radius ratio, length-to-tip radius
   ratio, diaphragm temperature ratio, and diaphragm pressure ratio are
   varied. It is shown that for a fixed geometry and initial conditions,
   the contact interface acquires a distorted three-dimensional
   time-dependent orientation at non-zero wheel Mach numbers. At a fixed
   wheel Mach number, the level of distortion depends primarily on the
   density ratio across the interface and also the hub-to-tip radius ratio.
   The nature of the rarefaction and shock wave propagation is
   one-dimensional, although the acoustic waves are diffracted due to the
   radially varying propagation speed. Under conditions of initially
   homentropic solid-body rotation, a degree of similarity exists between
   rotating and stationary shock-tube flows. This similarity is exploited
   to arrive at an approximate analytical solution to the Riemann problem
   in a rotating shock-tube.}},

Abstract = {{Modelling of crack behaviour is an important topic when establishing
   realistic macroscopic constitutive relations for brittle materials, such
   as ceramics, concrete, rock, etc. Upon introducing discontinuous
   approximation of the continuum, a crack model is derived on the basis of
   the Rankine plasticity model and the fictitious crack concept of
   Hillerborg et al.(1) The derivation results in a crack band relation,
   whose constitutive properties are based on failure kinematics that
   resemble the classical shear band concept. It appears that it is,
   essentially, the acoustic tenser that governs the constitutive relation
   for the crack band. This tenser has previously been analysed extensively
   to determine conditions for loss of ellipticity and possibility for
   discontinuous bifurcation in the rate of deformation field. In the
   present approach a similar analysis is carried out to determine
   conditions that characterize fracture initiation and crack band
   orientation. The model is implemented together with a mesh realignment
   strategy, and a solution advancement formulation, that ensures the crack
   propagates along critical interfacial directions. These directions
   depend on the actual stress state and are kept fixed after plastic
   localization (or cracking) has occurred. Hence, a `fixed crack' model is
   obtained. Numerical results involving successive crack development as
   well as failure of concrete beams are presented.}},

   (reaction enthalpy in the calorimetric measurements and hypersound

   assumption of an Arrhenius behavior. These differences are ascribed to
   the relation of the observed properties with respect to the evolution of
   the reaction. The enthalpy production of the system observed in the

Abstract = {{A method is described for improving the sensitivity of peptide mapping
   with electrospray liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using
   trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) containing HPLC mobile phases. The signal
   suppressing effects of TFA are shown to be due to the combined effect of
   ion-pairing and surface tension modifications. The post-column addition
   of a propionic acid-2-propanol (75:25, v/v) in a 1:2 proportion with the
   HPLC mobile phase counteracts the deleterious effects of TFA resulting
   in 10-100 x improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio. The system
   described introduces total HPLC flow (plus additive) directly into the
   electrospray source without splitting. Using 2.1 mm I.D. HPLC columns,
   minimum detectable quantities are below 40 pmol total protein.
   As examples, separations of proteolytic enzyme digests of several
   proteins are shown using standard HPLC conditions, comparing results
   with and without the addition of propionic acid. The application of the
   technique is shown in more depth in the identification of oxidative
   modification sites in glutamine synthetase. In this application, the
   enhanced sensitivity allowed location of a modified residue by
   comparison endoproteinase Lys C digest of native and oxidized forms of
   the protein without extensive sample preparation or concentration. A
   third application demonstrates the identification of glycosylation sites

Abstract = {{A site-specific double mutant, in which the large aromatic residues
   M208Tyr and L181Phe in the interior of the photosynthetic reaction
   center (RC) complex were replaced by smaller threonine residues, showed
   a dramatic reduction in the number of assembled complexes and was
   incapable of photosynthetic growth. The cavity created by the smaller
   side-chains was thought to interfere with the stability and/or assembly
   of the complex. Phenotypic revertants were recovered in which a
   spontaneous second-site mutation restored photocompetence in the
   presence of the original site-specific mutations. In these strains, an
   Ala --> Pro substitution in a neighboring transmembrane helix (at M271)
   resulted in an increased yield of RC complexes. To test the hypothesis
   that the original phenotype was due to a cavity, other mutants were
   constructed that created similar-sized voids at other positions in the
   membrane-spanning interior. These substitutions caused the same
   phenotype. Coupling of the above proline substitution to these new
   cavity mutants also resulted in photocompetent strains that carry
   increased levels of RC complexes. Therefore, the proline substitution at
   M271 serves as a global suppressor of the phenotype caused by these
   internal cavities. The proline substitution slightly increases the
   thermal stability of the complex at higher temperatures, but the mutant
   and suppressor strains have about the same stability at the optimal
   culture temperature, where both are less stable than the wild-type
   strain. Therefore, the proline substitution may suppress the
   non-photosynthetic phenotype of cavity mutants by facilitating folding
   of the nascent polypeptides as they assemble with cofactors to form the
   transmembranar RC complex. The proline replacement occurs at a
   pre-existing kink in a transmembrane helix where it can be accommodated
   without introducing a strain in the structure. The function of proline
   residues in transmembrane helices might be to promote folding and/or
   assembly in general. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

Abstract = {{Adrenomedullin is a strong vasorelaxing peptide discovered in

   To test the hypothesis that adrenomedullin plays a role similar to that
   of atrial natriuretic peptide or brain natriuretic peptide in modulating
   right ventricular responses to pulmonary hypertension, we have compared
   concentrations of immunoreactive rat adrenomedullin and adrenomedullin
   messenger RNA levels in tissues of monocrotaline treated rats with those
   of control rats. We also measured the effect of pulmonary hypertension
   on plasma level of the peptide. The concentrations of adrenomedullin
   immunoreactivity in right ventricle and plasma were significantly higher
   in monocrotaline treated rats than in control rats. The messenger RNA
   level of adrenomedullin in right ventricle was also higher in
