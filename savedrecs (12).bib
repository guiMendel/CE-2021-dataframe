Abstract = {{Treatment that will not provide significant net benefit at the end of a
   person's life (called futile treatment) is considered by many people to
   represent a major problem in the health sector, as it can waste
   resources and raise significant ethical issues. Medical treatment at the
   end of life involves a complex negotiation that implicates intergroup
   communication between health professionals, patients, and families, as
   well as between groups of health professionals. This study, framed by
   intergroup language theory, analyzed data from a larger project on
   futile treatment, in order to examine the intergroup language associated
   with futile treatment. Hospital doctors (N = 96) were interviewed about
   their understanding of treatment given to adult patients at the end of
   life that they considered futile. We conducted a discourse analysis on
   doctors' descriptions of futile treatment provided by themselves and
   their in-group and out-group colleagues. Results pointed to an
   intergroup context, with patients, families, and colleagues as
   out-groups. In their descriptions, doctors justified their own decisions
   using the language of logic, ethics, and respect. Patients and families,
   however, were characterized in terms of wishing and wanting, as were
   out-group colleagues. In addition, out-group doctors were described in
   strongly negative intergroup language.}},

Title = {{SSBP3 Interacts With Islet-1 and Ldb1 to Impact Pancreatic beta-Cell
   Target Genes}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1774-1786}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Islet-1 (Isl1) is a Lin11, Isl1, Mec3 (LIM)-homeodomain transcription
   factor important for pancreatic islet cell development, maturation, and
   function, which largely requires interaction with the LIM domain-binding
   protein 1 (Ldb1) coregulator. In other tissues, Ldb1 and Isl1 interact
   with additional factors to mediate target gene transcription, yet few
   protein partners are known in beta-cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that
   Ldb1 and Isl1 participate in larger regulatory complexes to impact
   beta-cell gene expression. To test this, we used cross-linked
   immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify interacting
   proteins from mouse beta-cells. Proteomic datasets revealed numerous
   interacting candidates, including a member of the single-stranded
   DNA-binding protein (SSBP) coregulator family, SSBP3. SSBPs potentiate
   LIM transcription factor complex activity and stability in other
   tissues. However, nothing was known of SSBP3 interaction, expression, or
   activity in beta-cells. Our analyses confirmed that SSBP3 interacts with
   Ldb1 and Isl1 in beta-cell lines and in mouse and human islets and
   demonstrated SSBP3 coexpression with Ldb1 and Isl1 pancreas tissue.
   Furthermore, beta-cell line SSBP3 knockdown imparted mRNA deficiencies
   similar to those observed upon Ldb1 reduction in vitro or in vivo. This
   appears to be (at least) due to SSBP3 occupancy of known Ldb1-Isl1
   target promoters, including MafA and Glp1r. This study collectively
   demonstrates that SSBP3 is a critical component of Ldb1-Isl1 regulatory
   complexes, required for expression of critical beta-cell target genes.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal dynamics of louse (Phthiraptera) populations on feral pigeons,
   Columba livia Gmelin (Aves: Columbiformes: Columbidae) were investigated
   from 2003 to 2012 in southern Manitoba, Canada. Pigeons were infested
   with: Philopteridae - Campanulotes compar (Burmeister), Columbicola
   columbae (Linnaeus), and Coloceras tovornikae Tendeiro; Menoponidae -
   Hohorstiella lata (Piaget). We consider the hypothesis that four species
   living on the same host show similar seasonal dynamics, coordinated by
   the life history of the host. Adults of both sexes and nymphs of all
   four species were present on pigeons throughout the year, consistent
   with continuous feeding and reproduction. Campanulotes compar and C.
   columbae populations were low in spring and peaked in September, with C.
   columbae showing greater seasonal changes for all population parameters.
   Coloceras tovornikae showed two annual peaks in abundance in spring and
   late summer, and H. lata was most abundant in the cold months of the
   year. Over 10 years, the four species showed distinct seasonal dynamics,
   although they live on the same birds. Seasonal patterns provided no
   evidence that louse reproduction or abundance is coordinated by the long
   breeding and moulting seasons of the host.}},

Abstract = {{Far from being limited to social scientists, the market approach to
   religions has been widely adopted by religious actors as well, sometimes
   in a very explicit way. With an ethnographic methodology, this research
   analyzes how Buddhist organizations in South Korea are implementing
   business concepts and methods in temples with the aim of increasing
   their influence in society. It addresses how managerial models and
   advertising techniques have been appropriated in a religious context and
   how they interact with redefinitions of Buddhist propagation. This paper
   argues that the use of communication and management techniques from the
   business world is not an epiphenomenon. Instead, it echoes a deeper
   transformation of Buddhism within South Korean society, especially in
   the role and place of the laity. For the urban temples engaged in
   ambitious development projects, the use of market related techniques is
   not merely a way to engage in a market-like competition. It also
   contributes to redefine their organizational structure as well as their
   division of religious work, in affinity with a dominant concept of
   religion.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering, whether in the form of product development or manufacturing

   performance. The interplay between materials and engineering is dynamic,
   ongoing, and critical to the success of many new products and
   industries. In this article, we take examples of this interplay from
   four technology companies in different industries developing widely
   different materials systems. Each example demonstrates the critical role
   that materials play in creating new products, new manufacturing methods,
   and even new design methodologies. Our examples come from polymer
   microfluidic devices, silicon- and nonsilicon-based
   microelectromechanical systems, and metals additive manufacturing.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The problem of finding the highest limiting Z in the extended periodic
   table is discussed. The upper limit suggested by the atomic many body
   theory at Z = 172 may be reached much earlier due to nuclear
   instabilities. Therefore, an extensive set of calculations based on the
   relativistic mean field formulation are carried out for the ground state
   properties of nuclei with Z = 100 to 180 and N/Z ratio ranging from 1.19
   to 2.70. This choice of Z and N extends far beyond the corresponding
   values of all the known heavy to superheavy elements. To facilitate the
   analysis of the huge quantity of calculated results, various filters
   depending upon the pairing energies, one and two nucleon separation
   energies, binding energy per particle (BE/A) and alpha-decay plus
   fission half lives, are introduced. The limiting value of Z is found to
   be 146. For the specific filter with BE/A = 5.5 MeV a few nuclei with Z
   = 180 also appear. No evidence for the limiting Z value 172 is found. We
   stress the need to bridge the atomic and nuclear findings and to arrive
   at an acceptable limiting value of highest Z (or rather combination of Z
   and N) of the extended periodic table.}},

Abstract = {{The quality and quantity of mandibular bone are essential prerequisites
   for osseointegrated implants. Only the Hounsfield unit on preoperative
   computed tomography is currently used as a clinical index. Nevertheless,
   a considerable mismatch occurs between bone quality and the Hounsfield
   unit. Loss of bone toughness during aging has been accepted based on
   empirical evidence, but this concept is unlikely evidence based at the
   level of mechanical properties. Nonenzymatic bone matrix cross-links
   associated with advanced glycation end products predominate as a
   consequence of aging. Thus, loss of tissue integrity could diminish the
   bone toughening mechanism. Here, we demonstrate an impaired bone
   toughening mechanism caused by mimicking aging in rabbits on a
   methionine-rich diet, which enabled an enhanced nonenzymatically
   cross-linked bone matrix. A 3-point bending test revealed a greater
   reduction in femoral fracture resistance in rabbits on a methionine-rich
   diet, despite higher maximum and normalized breaking forces (287.3 N and
   88.1\%, respectively), than in rabbits on a normal diet (262.2 N and
   79.7\%, respectively). In situ nanoindentation on mandibular cortical
   bone obtained from rabbits on a methionine-rich diet did not enable
   strain rate-dependent stiffening and consequent large-dimensional
   recovery during rapid loading following constant displacement after a
   rapid-load indentation test as compared with those in rabbits on a
   normal diet. Such nanoscale structure-function relationships dictate
   resistance to cracking propagation at the material level and allow for
   the overall bone toughening mechanism to operate under large external
   stressors. The strain-dependent stiffening was likely associated with
   strain-energy transfer to the superior cross-linked bone matrix network
   of the normal diet, while the reduction in the enzymatically
   cross-linked matrix in bone samples from rabbits on a methionine-rich
   diet likely diminished the intrinsic bone toughening mechanism. The
   present study also provides a precise protocol for evaluating bone
   mechanical properties at the material level based on observations from a
   series of nanoindentation experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To share our 25 years of experience with patients with
   primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and to describe the natural
   history of the disease including presenting clinical and laboratory
   characteristics and long-term disease outcomes.
   Patients and Methods: One thousand consecutive patients with primary MDS
   evaluated at Mayo Clinic between January 1, 1989, and May 1, 2014, were
   considered. The Revised International Prognostic Scoring System and
   other risk models were applied for risk stratification. Separate
   analyses were conducted for patients diagnosed before 2005 (n=531) and
   after 2005 (n=469).
   Results: Eighty-five percent of patients were older than 60 years
   (median age, 72 years), with 69\% being men. The median follow-up period
   was 27 months (range, 0-300 months), during which time 808 (81\%) deaths
   and 129 (13\%) leukemic transformations were documented. Median survival
   and leukemic transformation rates were similar in patients diagnosed
   before or after 2005, despite the significantly higher use of
   hypomethylating agents in the latter group: 33 months vs 28 months
   (P=.46) and 13\% vs 10\% (P=.92), respectively. Revised International
   Prognostic Scoring System risk distribution was similar in patients
   diagnosed before or after 2005 (P=.23): 17\% were categorized as very
   low, 36\% low, 21\% intermediate, 15\% high, and 11\% very high risk,
   with a median survival of 72, 43, 24, 18, and 7 months, respectively
   (P<.001). We found Revised International Prognostic Scoring System
   cytogenetic risk categorization to be suboptimal in its performance,
   whereas contemporary prognostic models were broadly similar in their
   performance.
   Conclusion: The poor outcome in patients with MDS does not appear to
   have improved over time. Current risk stratification systems for MDS are
   not substantially different from each other. There is a dire need for
   drugs that are truly disease modifying and risk models that incorporate
   prognostically relevant mutations. (C) 2015 Mayo Foundation for Medical

Abstract = {{In hierarchical production planning (HPP) systems, aggregate production
   planning (APP) is meant to balance capacity requirements and production
   quantities for medium term planning horizons. Aggregate plans provide
   the basic input for further planning steps. In recent years researchers
   came up with comprehensive models and sophisticated solution methods for
   this kind of high level planning. However, some practitioners claim that
   the aggregate planning concept is rarely applied in industry.
   We present a comprehensive HPP framework, which we use to investigate
   the impact of aggregate planning in a make-to-order (MTO) environment.
   The basic inputs for aggregate plans are market forecasts. Thus, we
   conduct experiments assuming different forecasting techniques. The
   planning problem is formulated as a linear mathematical model and solved
   to optimality by a standard optimization engine. A discrete-event
   simulation model is used to perform lower level planning steps and to
   mimic the shop floor where stochastic and nonlinear dependencies are
   considered. The performance of the system is evaluated based on service-
   and inventory levels. Real world data coming from the automotive
   supplier industry is used to define four demand scenarios. For each of
   them we compare the performance of the system with and without the
   inclusion of aggregate plans. If aggregate plans are used we assess the
   impact of different forecasting techniques. We analyze the results and
   give managerial recommendations. Our experiments show, for example, that
   in a setting of low capacity utilization, aggregate plans are rather
   unprofitable. Moreover, we observe that APP using time series
   forecasting techniques seems to be a good strategy if demand is highly
   volatile or resources are scarce. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The kinetic effect of subcritical aqueous alcohols (methanol, ethanol,
   1-propanol, 2-propanol, and t-butyl alcohol) on the isomerization of
   hexoses (mannose, glucose, and fructose) was examined at 180 degrees C
   at the alcohol concentrations ranging from 0 to 80\% (v/v). The results
   showed that increase in the concentration of primary and secondary
   alcohols markedly promoted the aldose-to-ketose isomerization; however,
   the ketose was scarcely isomerized to aldose and predominantly
   decomposed. Further, the kinetic analysis revealed that the rate
   constants of isomerization and decomposition strongly depended on the
   dielectric constant of the aqueous alcohols. The rate constants for
   isomerization were more sensitive to the change in the dielectric
   constant than the decomposition rate constants. On the other hand, the
   isomerization reactions of mannose and fructose were suppressed in
   subcritical aqueous t-butyl alcohol despite the low dielectric constant
   of the solution. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical value of using arterial spin labeling
   (ASL) technique preoperatively for non-invasive tumor grading in
   glioblastoma (GBM) patients.
   STUDY DESIGN: Forty-nine patients with GBMs were selected, including 21
   patients with high-grade gliomas and 28 patients with low-grade gliomas.
   ASL perfusion imaging was performed with GE Signa Excite HD 3.0 T MR
   scanning system (GE Healthcare). Relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and
   relative tumor blood flow (rTBF) were quantified in all patients.
   Statistical analysis was performed with STATA version 12.0 software.
   Further, relevant human cohort studies published in Chinese and English
   languages were identified by database searches and screened. Data was
   extracted and meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive
   Meta-analysis version 2.0 software.
   RESULTS: The ratios of rTBF to rCBF in the contralateral white matter,
   contralateral gray matter, and contralateral hemisphere of high-grade
   gliomas were higher than low-grade gliomas (all p < 0.05). ASL results
   in the solid tumors revealed that rCBF was greater in high-grade
   gliomas. Such differences in rCBF were not significant (p > 0.05) when 2
   and 5 cm distances from tumor margin were compared. Importantly, rCBF
   values showed statistical differences when the 2 cm distance was
   compared with the 5 cm distance from tumor margin (all p < 0.05).
   Finally, meta-analysis results supported the conclusion that rCBF and
   rTBF values were significantly higher in high-grade GBM as compared to
   low-grade GBM.
   CONCLUSION: We present convincing data that ASL is highly effective in
   differentiating between high-grade and low-grade gliomas, and thus is a
   useful tool for preoperative evaluation of GBM.}},

Abstract = {{A newly designed terahertz quantum-well photodetector (THz QWP)
   sandwiched between GaAs and Al0.04Ga0.96As material was demonstrated.
   Experimentally, we measure the response photo-current spectra and the
   current-voltage curve and obtain the peak response of 6.78 THz and
   background-noise-limited performance (BLIP) temperature of 16 K.
   Theoretically, we investigated the many body effect to the band
   structure of THz QWP and calculate the peak response of 6.64 THz which
   is in agreement with the experiment. So, many-body effect must be
   included in the design of THz QWPs. Then, we calculate the BLIP
   temperature of 17.5 K which is fitted well with the measurement.
   However, the low BLIP temperature is the main factor limiting
   applications of THz QWPs; we propose two schemes to improve the
   operating temperatures. Firstly, a scheme using an optical antenna to
   increase the BLIP temperature is proposed. Calculation shows the device
   is expected to achieve BLIP at 76 K when employing a 10(6) enhancement
   antenna. The second scheme is to use a THz quantum cascade laser as
   signal source to achieve photon-noise-limited performance (PLIP) at high
   temperatures. Simulations show that when the illumination intensity
   reaches 0.01. mW/mu m(2), the operation temperature could be 77 K.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The mechanism of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) remains
   unclear. Genetic factors may be associated with the risk of IgAN. This
   study aims to identify the possible association of M268T (rs699) in the
   Angiotensinogen (AGT) gene and A1166C (rs5186) in the Angiotensin II
   receptor type 1 (ATR1) gene with IgAN risk. Methods: Study subjects
   included 351 patients with IgAN and 310 controls from the Chinese
   population. The tag SNPs (tSNPs) were genotyped by Sequenom MassARRAY
   RS1000. Statistical analysis of the association between tSNPs and IgAN
   was performed using the (2) test and SNPStats software. Results: The AGT
   (M268T) genotypes were distributed in IgAN as CC 61.9\%, CT 34.8\%, and
   TT 3.2\%, while in controls CC 64.1\%, CT 31.3\%, and TT 4.6\%.
   Distribution of ATR1 (A1166C) was AA 87.7\%, CA 12.3\%, and CC 0\%,
   while in controls AA 87.2\%, CA 12\%, and CC 0.8\%. We further analyzed
   tSNPs under different inheritance models and found that there were no
   significant differences in the genotypes and allele frequencies of rs699
   and rs5186 between two groups (p>0.05). We also analyzed tSNPs based on
   the rate of pressure, proteinuria and Lee's classification, and no
   significant differences were found in the models (p>0.05). Conclusion:
   rs699 in the AGT gene and rs5186 in the ATR1 gene were not associated
   with the risk and clinical outcomes of IgAN.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND The everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS)
   is designed to achieve results comparable to metallic drug-eluting
   stents at 1 year, with improved long-term outcomes. Whether the 1-year
   clinical and angiographic results of BVS are noninferior to
   current-generation drug-eluting stents has not been established.
   OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate the angiographic efficacy and
   clinical safety and effectiveness of BVS in a randomized trial designed
   to enable approval of the BVS in China.
   METHODS Eligible patients with 1 or 2 de novo native coronary artery
   lesions were randomized to BVS or cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting
   stents (CoCr-EES) in a 1: 1 ratio stratified by diabetes and the number
   of lesions treated. Angiographic and clinical follow-up were planned at
   1 year in all patients. The primary endpoint was angiographic in-segment
   late loss (LL), powered for noninferiority with a margin of 0.15 mm.
   RESULTS A total of 480 patients were randomized (241 BVS vs. 239
   CoCr-EES) at 24 sites. Acute clinical device success (98.0\% vs. 99.6\%;
   p = 0.22) and procedural success (97.0\% and 98.3\%; p = 0.37) were
   comparable in BVS- and CoCr-EES-treated patients, respectively. The
   primary endpoint of in-segment LL at 1 year was 0.19 +/- 0.38 mm for BVS
   versus 0.13 +/- 0.38 mm for CoCr-EES; the 1-sided 97.5\% upper
   confidence limit of the difference was 0.14 mm, achieving noninferiority
   of BVS compared with CoCr-EES (P-noninferiority = 0.01). BVS and
   CoCr-EES also had similar 1-year rates of target lesion failure (cardiac
   death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target
   lesion revascularization; 3.4\% vs. 4.2\%, respectively; p = 0.62) and
   definite/probable scaffold/stent thrombosis (0.4\% vs. 0.0\%,
   respectively; p = 1.00).
   CONCLUSIONS In the present multicenter randomized trial, BVS was
   noninferior to CoCr-EES for the primary endpoint of in-segment LL at 1
   year. (A Clinical Evaluation of Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold

Abstract = {{The biotic ligand model (BLM) and the toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic

   in various species and exposure conditions; however, these models are
   usually separately utilized. In this study, a mechanistic TK-TD model
   was developed to predict the acute toxicity of 10(-6) M Cd and 10(-6) M
   Pb to zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae. The novel approach links the BLM
   with relevant TK processes to simulate the bioaccumulation processes of
   Cd or Pb as a function of the maximum uptake rate of each metal, the
   affinity constants, and the concentrations of free metal ions and H+ in
   test solutions. Results showed that the refined TK-TD model can
   accurately predict the accumulation and acute toxicity of Cd and Pb to
   zebrafish larvae at pH 5.5, 6.5, and 7.0. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{IET COMPUTER VISION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{857-863}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Robust object tracking is a challenging task because of factors such as
   pose variation, illumination changes, abrupt motion and background
   clutter across the video sequence. With the introduction of the
   compressive sensing theory, researchers are provided with a new and
   effective way of real-time object tracking. In this study, an enhanced
   fast compressive tracking based on an adaptive measurement matrix is
   presented, which the authors have named adaptive fast compressive
   tracking' (AFCT). The sparsity of the matrix and the number of columns
   are adaptively determined according to the dimension of the Haar-like
   feature. This measurement matrix is fixed once it has been calculated
   when selecting a tracked rectangle region in the first frame. Unlike
   most of the existing compressive trackers, the proposed method adopts a
   different adaptive measurement matrix for a different targeting object.
   Compared with the fast compressive tracking (FCT), each measurement
   element contains more information for the original signal. As a result,
   stable object tracking is achieved by using fewer measurement elements.
   The proposed AFCT method can run in real time and outperforms FCT on
   many challenging video sequences in terms of efficiency, accuracy and
   robustness.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) are common in patients with a
   continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD). The causes and
   clinical significance of early post-operative VAs have not previously
   been characterized in these patients. The purpose of this study was to
   assess the incidence, precipitants, and clinical impact of early VAs in
   patients supported by CF-LVADs.
   METHODS: Patients with a long-term CF-LVAD receiving care between
   January 1, 2012, and March 1, 2014, were enrolled and followed
   prospectively. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) were
   interrogated at baseline and throughout the follow-up period. VA was
   defined as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation lasting
   >30 seconds or effectively terminated by appropriate ICD tachytherapy or
   external defibrillation. The primary end-point was the occurrence of
   early VAs (within 30 days of surgery). Secondary end-points were right
   ventricular (RV) failure and need for VA ablation.
   RESULTS: There were 162 patients enrolled, and 38 (23.5\%) experienced
   at least 1 early VA. Predictors of early VA were a history of
   pre-operative VAs, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and older age. Several
   conditions frequently encountered in the early post-operative period
   were identified as possible precipitants for VA episodes. Early VAs were
   associated with post-operative RV failure, particularly when patients
   received shocks instead of anti-tachycardia pacing.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early VAs are common and are associated with RV failure.
   ICD shocks, but not antitachycardia pacing, for early VAs are associated
   with acute worsening of RV failure. (C) 2015 International Society for

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of well known recursive least square
   (RLS) harmonic estimation technique and its elimination with improved
   current control technique based shunt active power filter (SAPF) in a
   distorted power network. The estimation of amplitude and phase angle of
   fundamental and harmonics is performed using RLS algorithm, known for
   their simplicity of computation, accuracy and good convergence
   properties. The estimates are updated recursively as samples of the
   harmonic signals are received. In order to eliminate harmonics produced
   by the nonlinear load connected in the distribution network, a
   three-phase SAPF with modified current control technique is employed. In
   this paper, based on the analysis and modeling of SAPF with closed-loop
   control, a feed forward compensation path of load current and a new
   pulse width modulation (PWM) control scheme is proposed to improve the
   dynamic performance of the SAPF. In this case the amplitude and phase
   angle of the converter AC voltage should be adjusted using PWM, thus
   producing either leading or lagging reactive power. Harmonic contented
   in the signal is estimated at the point of common coupling (PCC) with
   and without SAPF. The comparative results of amplitude and phase angle
   of fundamental and selected harmonics are determined considering
   installation of SAPF in the distribution network. The system is studied
   using MATLAB environment to justify the effectiveness of proposed
   control technique in comparison to the other techniques discussed in the
   recent literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The 2015 algorithm for the comprehensive management of persons with type
   2 diabetes (T2D) was developed to provide clinicians with a practical
   guide that considers the whole patient, the spectrum of risks and
   complications, and evidence-based approaches to treatment. In addition
   to advocating for glycemic control so as to reduce microvascular
   complications, this document focuses on obesity and prediabetes as the
   underlying risk factors for diabetes and associated macrovascular
   complications. It is now clear that the progressive beta-cell defect
   that drives the deterioration of metabolic control over time begins
   early and may be present before the diagnosis of diabetes (1).
   This document accompanies the T2D Algorithm published in April 2015. It
   is organized into discrete sections that address the following topics:
   obesity; prediabetes; management of hyperglycemia through lifestyle
   modifications, pharmacotherapy, and insulin; management of hypertension;
   management of hyperlipidemia; and other riskreduction strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the use of organic minerals
   and lycopene in the diet of laying hens on performance and egg quality.
   288 hens were used, distributed in DIC in a factorial 2 x 3 (mineral
   sources x lycopene levels) with six treatments and six replicates of
   eight birds per experimental unit. The experimental diets were:
   inorganic minerals (MI) without the addition of lycopene; MI with the
   addition of lycopene (400mg/kg); MI with the addition of lycopene
   (800mg/kg); minerals organic (MOR) without addition lycopene; MOR with
   the addition of lycopene (400mg/kg); MOR with the addition of lycopene
   (800mg/kg). The following parameters were evaluated: feed intake, egg
   production, egg mass, feed conversion (kg/kg and kg/dz), egg weight,
   percentage shell, albumen and yolk, shell thickness specific gravity,
   unit Haugh, index and yolk color, pH of albumen and yolk. The organic
   minerals increase the feed intake when combined at levels of 0 and 800mg
   of lycopene. The combination of 400mg of lycopene with inorganic
   minerals increases feed intake. The addition of organic or mineral 400mg
   lycopene in diets improves egg production and egg weight of hens at 58
   weeks of age. The yolk color is more pronounced for inorganic sources in
   relation to organic and more pronounced in diets with 800mg of lycopene.
   The Haugh unit is higher in lycopene free diets and diets with inorganic
   mineral and 400mg of lycopene and organic minerals. Diets with organic
   source associated with 800mg of lycopene provide higher Haugh units for
   organic source without lycopene.}},

   Regarding the speed of the shots, the group of variable practice
   improved (p <=. 05) in the posttest and retention test. The group of

Abstract = {{Enhancing functional gene expression is key to high-level production of
   active chitinases. For this purpose, the effects of culture cell
   density, inducer concentration, post-induction time and induction
   temperatures on the functional expression of two different chitinases
   (HsChiA1p, a family 18 archaeal chitinase and PtChi19p, a family 19
   bacterial chitinase) were comparatively investigated. Results showed
   that the effect of each parameter on the activity of both chitinases was
   specific to each enzyme. In addition, different Escherichia coli host
   strains compatible with the expression in pET systems were assayed for
   active protein overexpression. When using BL21 Star (DE3), a significant
   increase of 60 \% in expression was observed for the active archaeal
   chitinase HsChiA1p as compared to that found when using BL21 (DE3),
   indicating that the rne131 gene mutation efficiently stabilizes the mRNA
   for HsChiA1p. Using the Codon Adaptation Index value, rare codon
   analysis of the archaeal HschiA1 and bacterial Ptchi19 genes revealed
   that both DNA sequences were not optimal for maximal expression in E.
   coli. Different E. coli host strains possess extra copies of some of the
   tRNA genes for rare codons. For the Rosetta 2 (DE3) and the BL21 RP
   (DE3) strains, a significant increase of 40 \% was reached for the
   activity of HsChiA1p and PtChi19p. Finally, as part of the protein still
   remained insoluble, the best conditions for recovering biologically
   active protein from inclusion bodies were established for each enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{This article focuses on how familiarity moderates task engagement.
   Blascovich et al. (1993) have demonstrated that task familiarity
   generally evokes challenge motivation; that is, the experience of having
   sufficient resources to meet task demands. Garcia-Marques, Mackie,
   Claypool, and Garcia-Marques (2013) have demonstrated that individuals
   attend less to details while performing familiar tasks thereby
   processing information more superficially. The relationship between
   these two effects was tested in two experiments including the assessment
   of both the physiological measures that index individuals' motivational
   states and of the way in which individuals process information.
   Experiment 1 revealed that familiarity with a persuasive message
   independently activates both a physiological challenge response and
   reduces participants' sensitivity to argument quality. Experiment 2
   provided additional evidence that the two effects act independently by
   showing that social presence moderates the first effect but not the
   second.}},

Abstract = {{The energy cost for producing electricity via wave energy converters
   (WECs) is still not competitive with other renewable energy sources,
   especially wind energy. It is well known that energy maximising control
   plays an important role to improve the performance of WECs, allowing the
   energy conversion to be performed as economically as possible. The
   control strategies are usually subsequently employed on a device that
   was designed and optimized in the absence of control for the prevailing
   sea conditions in a particular location. If an optimal unconstrained
   control strategy, such as pseudo-spectral optimal control (PSOC), is
   adopted, an overall optimized system can be obtained no matter whether
   the control design is incorporated at the geometry optimization stage or
   not. Nonetheless, strategies, such as latching control (LC), must be
   incorporated at the optimization design stage of the WEC geometry if an
   overall optimized system is to be realised. In this paper, the impact of
   device motion and force constraints in the design of control-informed
   optimized WEC geometries is addressed. The aim is to verify to what
   extent the constraints modify the connection between the control and the
   optimal device design. Intuitively, one might expect that if the
   constraints are very tight, the optimal device shape is the same
   regardless of incorporating or not the constrained control at the
   geometry optimization stage. However, this paper tests the hypothesis
   that the imposition of constraints will limit the control influence on
   the optimal device shape. PSOC, LC and passive control (PC) are
   considered in this study. In addition, constrained versions of LC and PC
   are presented.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{21-31}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens produces secondary
   metabolites called microcystins (MC) that are potent toxins for most
   eukaryotes, including zooplankton grazers, cattle and humans. P.
   rubescens occurs in many deep and thermally stratified lakes throughout
   Europe. In Lake Zurich (Switzerland), it re-appeared in the 1970s
   concomitant with decreasing eutrophication. Since then, P. rubescens has
   become the dominant species in this major drinking water reservoir,
   where it forms massive metalimnetic blooms during late summer. These
   cyanobacteria harbor subpopulations of non-MC producers, but little is
   known about the environmental factors affecting the success of such
   genotypes. The non-MC-producing subpopulation of P. rubescens was
   studied using a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay on the MC
   synthetase (mcy) gene cluster that targets a deletion on the mcyH and
   mcyA genes, which inactivates MC biosynthesis. Two complementary qPCR
   assays were used to assess the total population abundance (based on the
   16S rDNA gene) and the mcy gene copy number (based on a conserved region
   in the adenylation domain of the mcyB gene). The objective was to
   evaluate the seasonal patterns of the share of non-MC-producing
   filaments in the total P. rubescens population. The mcyHA mutants were
   present in low proportions (up to 14\%) throughout the year. Their
   highest relative abundances occurred during the winter mixis, when total
   concentrations of P. rubescens were minimal. The MC deficient mutants
   seemed to better survive in sparse populations, possibly because of
   lower grazing pressure and a consequently reduced need for MG-mediated
   protection. Alternatively, the mutants might cope better with the
   sub-optimal, stressful pressure and light conditions during the winter
   mixis. Altogether, our results suggest that subtle trade-offs might
   seasonally determine the proportions of non-MC producers within P.
   rubescens populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The glomerular filtration barrier consists of podocytes, the glomerular
   basement membrane, and endothelial cells covered with a glycocalyx.
   Heparan sulphate (HS) in the glomerular filtration barrier is reduced in
   patients with proteinuria, which is associated with increased expression
   of the HS-degrading enzyme heparanase. Previously, we showed that
   heparanase is essential for the development of proteinuria in
   experimental diabetic nephropathy. Vitamin D supplementation reduces
   podocyte loss and proteinuria in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we
   hypothesize that vitamin D reduces proteinuria by reducing glomerular
   heparanase. Adriamycin-exposed rats developed proteinuria and showed
   increased heparanase expression, which was reduced by
   1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1,25-D-3) treatment. In vitro, adriamycin
   increased heparanase mRNA in the podocyte, which could be corrected by
   1,25-D-3 treatment. In addition, 1,25-D-3 treatment reduced
   transendothelial albumin passage after adriamycin stimulation. In line
   with these results, we showed direct binding of the vitamin D receptor
   to the heparanase promoter, and 1,25-D-3 dose-dependently reduced
   heparanase promoter activity. Finally, 1,25-D-3-deficient 25-hydroxy-1
   alpha-hydroxylase knockout mice developed proteinuria and showed
   increased heparanase, which was normalized by 1,25-D-3 treatment. Our
   data suggest that the protective effect of vitamin D on the development
   of proteinuria is mediated by inhibiting heparanase expression in the
   podocyte. Copyright (C) 2015 Pathological Society of Great Britain and

Abstract = {{RECENT INITIATIVES IN THE early childhood education and care sector have
   increased the demand for early childhood teachers to work in long day
   care settings. This study explores the perceptions of pre-service
   teachers who had recently finished their final semester of study and
   were due to graduate from one Australian higher education institution in
   the state of Queensland. A cohort of pre-service teachers was invited to
   complete an online survey investigating their perceptions of working
   with infants and toddlers. A response rate of 80 per cent, representing
   25 respondents, participated in the study. Descriptive statistics and
   content analysis were employed to analyse the survey data. The findings
   reveal that overall, pre-service teachers reported they had a partial
   knowledge of children aged birth to three years after completion of
   their teacher education program. This was despite 10 days of placement
   with infants and toddlers, and knowledge and content about infants and
   toddlers being embedded throughout the teacher education program (birth
   to eight years). Findings are also relevant to industry and government
   policy-makers who are advocating for qualified early childhood teachers
   to work in prior to formal school settings within Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Exercise training induces reactive oxygen species production and low
   levels of oxidative damage, which are required for induction of
   antioxidant defenses and tissue adaptation. This process is
   physiological and essential to improve physical conditioning and
   performance. During exercise, endogenous antioxidants are recruited to
   prevent excessive oxidative stress, demanding appropriate intake of
   antioxidants from diet or supplements; in this context, the search for
   vitamin supplements that enhance the antioxidant defenses and improve
   exercise performance has been continuously increasing. On the other
   hand, excess of antioxidants may hinder the pro-oxidant signals
   necessary for this process of adaptation. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the effects of vitamin A supplementation (2000 IU/kg, oral)
   upon oxidative stress and parameters of pro-inflammatory signaling in
   lungs of rats submitted to aerobic exercise (swimming protocol). When
   combined with exercise, vitamin A inhibited biochemical parameters of
   adaptation/conditioning by attenuating exercise-induced antioxidant
   enzymes (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) and decreasing
   the content of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products.
   Increased oxidative damage to proteins (carbonylation) and lipids
   (lipoperoxidation) was also observed in these animals. In sedentary
   animals, vitamin A decreased superoxide dismutase and increased
   lipoperoxidation. Vitamin A also enhanced the levels of tumor necrosis
   factor alpha and decreased interleukin-10, effects partially reversed by
   aerobic training. Taken together, the results presented herein point to
   negative effects associated with vitamin A supplementation at the
   specific dose here used upon oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory
   cytokines in lung tissues of rats submitted to aerobic exercise.}},

Abstract = {{Due to an error in the computer program used to summon potential jurors
   for service, the African-American percentage (4.17\%) of jury pools was
   only one-half their percentage (8.25\%) of the age-eligible population
   for about fifteen months. In June 2012, in Ambrose v. Booker, the Sixth
   Circuit accepted the statistical evidence as sufficient to meet the
   requirements for a prima facie case of unfair representation the U.S.
   Supreme Court established in Duren. On the same day, the Michigan S. Ct.
   in People v. Bryant said that the statistics were insufficient. The
   Michigan Court accepted a new measure, the disparity of the risk (DR),
   of under-representation. The DR measure is shown to be extremely
   stringent and an alternativemeasure based on the probability that a jury
   randomly selected from the jury pool will have fewer minorities than a
   jury selected from the age-eligible population is proposed. The minority
   fraction of individuals ultimately serving on juries also depends on the
   fairness of the peremptory challenges made by the parties. A method for
   detecting unfairness is reviewed; its effectiveness depends on the
   number of minorities on the venire. A reanalysis of the Michigan data
   shows that if the proportion of African-Americans in the jury pool
   equaled their proportion in the age-eligible population, prosecutors
   could only reduce their proportion on juries to about 80\% of their
   proportion in the population. In contrast, the criteria for adequate
   representativeness based on the DR measure adopted by the Michigan Court
   could lead to virtually no minorities serving on actual juries as only
   three percent of the venires would have a sufficient number of
   minorities to classify a prosecutor's peremptory challenging all of them
   as significant. Our results indicate that when assessing statistics on
   the demographic mix of jury pools for legal significance, courts should
   consider the possible reduction in minority representation that can
   occur in the peremptory challenge proceedings.}},

   Nernst-Ettingshausen effect Q in high-temperature superconductors of the
   Y1-2x Ca (x) Pr (x) Ba2Cu3Oy system with different concentrations of
   dopants have been investigated experimentally. It has been shown that
   all the specific features revealed in the behavior of the two kinetic
   coefficients under investigation can be described using the narrow-band
   model with a single concept of the structure of an energy spectrum and a
   common set of model parameters that characterize the structure of the
   spectrum and properties of a system of charge carriers. Based on the
   quantitative analysis of the dependences S(T) and Q(T), the values of
   these parameters for samples of the studied composition have been
   determined and the character of their changes with an increase in the
   impurity content has been analyzed. It has been demonstrated that, for
   the explanation of the obtained results, it is necessary to take into
   account the interaction of calcium and praseodymium ions upon their
   simultaneous introduction into the lattice. It has been found that the
   mobility of charge carriers has extremely low values and almost does not
   depend on the level of doping, which is associated with the character of
   changes in the structure of the energy spectrum of Y1-2x Ca (x) Pr (x)
   Ba2Cu3Oy upon doping. It has been concluded that the structure of the
   energy spectrum of high-temperature superconductors in the yttrium
   system is characterized by an asymmetry of the dispersion curve.}},

Abstract = {{To deal with real life scenarios for wireless sensor networks with
   uneven contours, connectivity issues, and dropping packets,
   heterogeneous sensors became the vital factor to enhance its capability
   in terms of energy efficiency and end-to-end packet delay. In recent
   times, end-to-end packet delay has a significant role in wireless sensor
   networks along with energy efficiency and network lifetime. In the
   present situation, the information delayed is information lost, and
   hence, end-to-end packet delay is playing an important role in wireless
   sensor networks. To address the issue of end-to-end packet delay in
   wireless sensor network, a mobile cluster-head data collection model for
   heterogeneous wireless sensor networks has been evaluated. In this
   paper, the mobile cluster-head data collection model has been evaluated
   for two different scenarios. This paper also illustrates the velocity of
   the cluster-head node with which it should move to reduce the end-to-end
   packet delay. The mobile cluster-head data collection mobility model has
   been evaluated for end-to-end packet delay on the basis of data send
   rate, network size, sensor node density, and cluster-head node density.
   For verification and validation, extensive simulations have been
   conducted which validates that the efficient mobility pattern of the
   mobile cluster-head nodes can lower end-to-end packet delay of wireless
   sensor networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel bimetallic Fe-Zn nanoparticle was synthesized via
   a coprecipitation method and applied for the adsorptive removal of
   carcinogenic dye malachite green (MG) and Congo red (CR) in water. The
   synthesized bimetallic Fe-Zn nanopartides were characterized by TEM,
   XRD, FTIR, and SEM with an attached EDX, a BET surface area analyzer,
   and by determining pH(zpc). Batch adsorption experiments were conducted
   to evaluate the adsorption process by varying the optimization
   parameters such as the solution pH, time, and initial dye concentration.
   The process was initially very rapid, and the maximum adsorption was
   observed within 60 min of contact time. The kinetics of removal were
   tested with a pseudo-first order, a pseudo-second order, and an
   intra-particle diffusion model and showed the best agreement with the
   pseudo-second order model. Adsorption data were modeled with Langmuir,
   Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms and had a good
   fit with the Langmuir isotherm model. The Langmuir maximum adsorption
   capacity for MG and CR was found to be 21.74 and 28.56 mg/g,
   respectively. The adsorption process was endothermic with positive
   values of triangle H degrees of 62.73 and 69.65 kJ/mol for MG and CR,
   respectively, and was spontaneous, as the triangle G degrees value was
   negative for all of the samples. A positive AS value indicates increased
   disorder at the solid-solution interface during the adsorption of the MG
   and CR dyes. An attempt was made to regenerate the MG-and CR-loaded
   bimetallic Fe-Zn nanoparticles with suitable eluents and the regenerated
   bimetallic Fe-Zn nanoparticles were reused seven and six times with
   removal levels higher than 70\% for the adsorption of MG and CR,
   respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Rationale for a diagnostic approach in non-Graves' orbital inflammation
   - Report of 61 patients}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL FRANCAIS D OPHTALMOLOGIE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Introduction.- Orbital inflammatory syndromes include a wide variety of
   inflammatory intraorbital processes which are very different in terms of
   clinical presentation and prognosis. We currently prefer to
   differentiate so-called ``specific{''} inflammations, for which an
   etiology is able to be identified, from idiopathic orbital inflammatory
   syndromes (IOIS), for which the etiology remains unknown and the
   histology is nonspecific.
   Purpose.- To propose an efficient diagnostic approach for clinicians
   managing patients with non-Graves' orbital inflammations. Materials and
   methods. This is a retrospective and prospective study concerning 61
   patients managed by the medical team for non-Graves' orbital
   inflammations between May, 1999 and May, 2013 in the ophthalmology
   departments of Nice and Limoges university hospitals in France.
   Seventeen specific inflammations, 19 orbital lymphomas and 25 idiopathic
   orbital inflammatory syndromes were included. Patients were divided into
   two groups. Thirty-six patients (group 1) underwent primary biopsy,
   while for the other 25 (group 2), therapy was begun empirically without
   biopsy. We could therefore compare both approaches in terms of
   diagnostic efficiency and time until identification of a specific
   etiology.
   Results.- Our statistical results show that an approach without primary
   biopsy leads to a number of specific diagnoses statistically much lower
   than that obtained by the approach with primary biopsy. Also, the risk
   of missing a specific inflammation (with as a consequence an
   inappropriate treatment and a risk of functional sequelae as well as a
   fatal risk of missing a lymphoproliferative pathology) is very clearly
   higher in the case of not performing primary biopsy. Finally, the
   average time elapsed between the initial consultation with the
   ophthalmologist and a specific diagnosis was one month in the case of
   the first approach, while this delay was almost three times higher with
   the second approach, with a mean of 2.91 months (P<0.01). Discussion.
   Our study shows that biopsy should be the mainstay of diagnostic
   management. A trial of empiric treatment is only performed first in
   myositis or in locations where biopsy could jeopardize functional
   prognosis. It should only be done after biopsy in all other cases. Of
   course, in all cases of relapse or recurrence after treatment, biopsy
   should be performed or repeated.
   Conclusion.- The diagnostic work-up of a patient with an orbital
   inflammatory process must of course include blood testing and orbital
   imaging, but also a systematic primary biopsy for histological
   examination in the vast majority of cases. It must be repeated at least
   in the case of any doubt about the diagnosis or in the case of any
   recurrence or resistance to treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{We propose and demonstrate a pseudo Fabry-Perot filter in the terahertz

   toward higher frequencies when the refractive index of liquid crystal
   decreases. The measured transmission spectra are consistent with
   corresponding simulations. Via thermally tuning the refractive index of
   the filled liquid crystal, the resonant transmission frequencies shift
   accordingly. The work supplies a novel design for tunable terahertz
   filters, which would play important roles in terahertz imaging, sensing,

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of replacing dietary
   fish oil (FO) with linseed oil (LO) on growth, fatty acid composition
   and regulation of lipid metabolism in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis)
   juveniles. Fish (17.5 g initial body weight) were fed isoproteic and
   isoenergetic diets containing 116 g/kg of lipid for 10 weeks. Fish fed
   the LO diet displayed lower growth rates and lower levels of DHA in the
   liver and muscle than fish fed the FO diet, while mortality was not
   affected by dietary treatment. However, DHA content recorded in the
   liver and muscle of fish fed the LO diet remained relatively high,
   despite a weight gain of 134 \% and a reduced dietary level of
   long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), suggesting endogenous
   LC-PUFA biosynthesis. This was supported by the higher amounts of
   pathway intermediates, including 18:4n-3, 20:3n-3, 20:4n-3, 18:3n-6 and
   20:3n-6, recorded in the liver of fish fed the LO diet in comparison
   with those fed the FO diet. However, fads2 and elovl5 gene expression
   and FADS2 enzyme activity were comparable between the two groups.
   Similarly, the expression of genes involved in eicosanoid synthesis was
   not modulated by dietary LO. Thus, the present study demonstrated that
   in fish fed LO for 10 weeks, growth was reduced but DHA levels in
   tissues were largely maintained compared to fish fed FO, suggesting a
   physiologically relevant rate of endogenous LC-PUFA biosynthesis
   capacity.}},

   A Retrospective Comparative Study}},

Abstract = {{Azacitidine is a treatment option for patients with acute myeloid
   leukemia (AML) who cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy. It is still
   unknown which patients will benefit most from azacitidine treatment.
   Therefore, we conducted a retrospective comparative study on 40 patients
   with newly diagnosed and relapsed AML. We found no significant
   difference in overall survival time (10 months) between these 2 patient
   groups. Prior treatment does not predict poor outcome. Achievement of
   transfusion independency was associated with longer survival.
   Introduction: Azacitidine is a therapeutic alternative to low-dose
   cytarabine in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are unfit
   for intensive chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively
   analyzed all AML patients treated with azacitidine at the University
   Hospital Zurich and the Kantonsspital Munsterlingen between January 2005
   and December 2011. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
   Results: Thirty-eight patients were included in the analysis. Twenty-one
   (55\%) patients had newly diagnosed AML, 14 (37\%) had relapsed AML, and
   3 (8\%) underwent bridging therapy before allogeneic stem-cell
   transplantation. Age at diagnosis was 72 years in the newly diagnosed
   cohort and 58 years in the relapsed cohort, 19 (50\%) patients were
   female, 20 (53\%) patients were transfusion dependent, and bone marrow
   blast count was 43\% (interquartile range, 26-80). Most patients (58\%)
   had poor or very poor risk AML. Patients received a median (range) of 7
   (3-13) therapy cycles. The median (range) OS in the newly diagnosed and
   previously treated patient groups were 308 (175-580) days and 346
   (293-628) days, respectively (P = .94). Median OS in the 3 patients
   treated before allogeneic stem-cell transplantation has not been
   reached. Sixty-day mortality was 7.9\%, with no difference between the 2
   groups. Ongoing or increasing transfusion dependency was associated with
   adverse outcome (hazard ratio, 3.09; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.29-7.37, P = .011). Conclusion: Treatment with azacitidine led to a
   median OS of 10 months in both a previously untreated and a previously
   treated frail AML patient cohort. A positive effect in transfusion
   dependency was observed in 29\% of these patients and was associated
   with better survival. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   patients' toothbrushes and 0-13\% of healthy children's toothbrushes.
   There was no statistical correlation between pulmonary colonization and
   toothbrush contamination. P. aeruginosa genotyping showed two identical
   clones on the patients' toothbrushes and in their sputum, and between
   one patient's sputum and his sibling's toothbrush.
   Conclusion. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa can colonize CF patients'
   toothbrushes. The impact on pulmonary colonization remains unknown.
   Toothbrush decontamination methods need to consider these bacteria in CF
   patients. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.}},

   performance: analysis of the 2012 super rugby competition. J Strength
   Cond Res 29(12): 3360-3366, 2015The aim of this study was to investigate
   whether playing rugby at altitude or after travel (domestic and
   international) disadvantaged teams. In a retrospective longitudinal
   study, all matches (N = 125) played in the 2012 Super Rugby Competition
   were analyzed for key performance indicators (KPI) from coded game data
   provided by OPTA sports data company. Matches were played in a home-away
   format in New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia. Teams based at sea
   level but playing at altitude (1,271-1,753 m) were more likely to miss
   tackles (mean +/- 90\% confidence interval, 1.4 +/- 1.7) and score fewer
   points in the first half compared with games at sea level. In the second
   half of games, sea level teams at altitude were very likely to make
   fewer gain lines (-4.0 +/- 2.7) compared with the second half of games
   at sea level. The decreased ability to break the defensive line, which
   may be the result of altitude-induced fatigue, could reduce the
   likelihood of scoring points and winning a game. Travel also had an
   effect on KPI, where international travel resulted in more missed
   tackles (1.7 +/- 1.3) and less frequent gain lines (-3.0 +/- 1.9) in the
   first half relative to matches at home; overall, away teams (domestic
   and international) scored 4 less points in the second half compared with
   home teams. In conclusion, playing away from home in another country,
   particularly at altitude, can have a detrimental effect on KPI, which
   may affect the overall performance and the chances of winning matches.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: serum albumin the biomarker most frequently used as one of
   three biochemical criteria for diagnosis of protein energy wasting
   (PEW). However, as a nutritional parameter it's unreliable in chronic
   kidney disease (CICD). The subjective global assessment (SGA) has been
   recommended for nutritional evaluation and the PEW in CKD.
   Objective: determine association between the levels of serum albumin and
   SGA in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who started
   peritoneal dialysis (PD).
   Methods: a cross-sectional study in patients with ESRD were evaluated
   prior to starting PD. Levels of serum albumin were determined and
   nutritional assessment was performed by SGA.
   Results: 69 patients, 46 (67\%) men and 23 (33\%) women, average age
   39.97 +/- 18.30 years old, serum albumin 2.75 +/- 0.65 g/dl, creatinine
   18.91 +/- 10.98 mg/dl, urea 314.80 +/- 152.74 mg/dl and BMI 23.37 +/-
   3.79 kg/m(2), median of GFR 3 (1-12) mL/min/1.73m(2). The SGA showed
   that 34.8\% was well nourished, 40.6\% had risk of moderate PEW and the
   24.6\% had severe PEW. There was no association (p=ns) between the
   levels of serum albumin and SGA.
   Conclusion: the present study shows hypoalbuminemia and PEW are very
   frequent. The identification of levels of serum albumin and SGA at the
   beginning of PD in our population could be predictors of mortality.
   Serum albumin is not a useful tool for nutritional assessment in
   patients with ERSD who initiate PD.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses piecewise bilinear models and recurrent fuzzy
   systems as particular classes of dynamic fuzzy systems, which can be
   dealt with in the same framework due to their structural similarity. As
   universal approximators, they are capable of representing any continuous
   nonlinear system dynamics with arbitrary accuracy by means of a rule
   base. First, basic definitions of both systems are revisited here, and
   unifying canonical forms are given. Then, a stability criterion is
   derived for the system classes, which is based on approximating
   piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions and formulated in terms of linear
   matrix inequalities. The main contribution is the demonstration of the
   stability analysis and estimation of region of attraction by means of
   these models, outperforming methods reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{During the periparturient phase, cows are typically in an
   inflammation-like condition, and it has been suggested that inflammation
   associated with the development of stress of the endoplasmic reticulum
   (ER) in the liver contributes to the development of fatty liver syndrome
   and ketosis. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that
   feeding grape seed and grape marc meal extract (GSGME) as a plant
   extract rich in flavonoids attenuates inflammation and ER stress in the
   liver of dairy cows. Two groups of cows received either a total mixed
   ration as a control diet or the same total mixed ration supplemented
   with 1\% of GSGME over the period from wk 3 prepartum to wk 9
   postpartum. Dry matter intake during wk 3 to 9 postpartum was not
   different between the 2 groups. However, the cows fed the diet
   supplemented with GSGME had an increased milk yield and an increased
   daily milk protein yield. Cows supplemented with GSGME moreover had a
   significantly reduced mRNA abundancy of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
   21, a stress hormone induced by various stress conditions, in the liver
   in wk 1 and 3 postpartum. In contrast, mRNA abundances of a total of 3
   genes involved in inflammation and 14 genes involved in ER stress
   response, as well as concentrations of triacylglycerols and cholesterol,
   in liver samples of wk 1 and 3 postpartum did not differ between the 2
   groups. Overall, this study shows that supplementation of GSGME did not
   influence inflammation or ER stress in the liver but increased milk
   yield, an effect that could be due to effects on ruminal metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Infants grow up as social beings and in their social settings, they are
   first exposed to language in use. This language forms part of their
   daily communication. By their first birthday, they can understand many
   characteristics of language. The scientific study of the infants'
   perception of speech and communication has been an interesting and
   productive area of research during the last century. This article
   provides a general overview of infant perception of segmental and
   suprasegmental features of language. The aim is to discuss the way
   infants develop their perceptual abilities and become proficient at
   perceiving and recognizing individual speech sounds through the auditory
   input. The results of this review show that infants can discriminate
   every phonetic contrast including the ones that do not occur in their
   native language environment. However, during the latter half of the
   first year, their listening experience with the native language begins
   to influence the perception of sound contrasts that are not part of
   their native phonological system.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Neurostimulation of the hypoglossal nerve has shown
   promising results in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. This
   anatomic study describes the detailed topography of the hypoglossal
   nerve's motor points as a premise for superselective neurostimulation in
   order to optimize results and minimize the risk of complications related
   to main nerve trunk manipulation.
   Methods: Thirty cadaveric hypoglossal nerves were dissected and
   characterized by number of branches, arborization pattern, and terminal
   branch motor point location. For each motor point, the distance to
   cervical midline (x axis), distance to posterior aspect of the symphysis
   (y axis), and depth from the plane formed by the inferior border of
   symphysis and anterior border of hyoid (z axis) were recorded.
   Results: The average number of distal branches for each hypoglossal
   nerve was found to be 9.95 +/- 2.28. The average number of branches per
   muscle was found to be 3.3 +/- 1.5 for the hyoglossus muscle, 1.8 +/-
   0.9 for the geniohyoid muscle, and 5.0 +/- 1.6 for the genioglossus
   muscle. It was found that branches to the genioglossus and geniohyoid
   muscles were located closer to midline (relative lengths of 0.19 +/-
   0.07 and 0.19 +/- 0.05, respectively) while hyoglossus branches were
   located more laterally (0.38 +/- 0.10 relative length). On the y-axis,
   the branches to the genioglossus were the most anterior and therefore
   closest to the posterior symphysis of the mandible (relative length of
   0.48 +/- 0.11), followed by the geniohyoid (0.66 +/- 0.09), and the
   hyoglossus (0.76 +/- 0.16). The branches to the geniohyoid were the most
   superficial (relative length of 0.26 +/- 0.06), followed by the
   genioglossus (0.36 +/- 0.09), and finally, the hyoglossus branches (0.47
   +/- 0.11), which were located deeply.
   Conclusion: A topographical map of the hypoglossal nerve terminal motor
   points was successfully created and could provide a framework for the
   optimization of the neurostimulation techniques.}},

   The groups had similar characteristics in terms of education. Norms for

Abstract = {{In this study, the elasto-plastic oblique impact of a rod with a flat
   has been analyzed experimentally and theoretically. Nine different
   flattening and indentation contact models have been used to simulate the
   impact. The models have been compared theoretically in terms of the
   linear and the angular motion, the contact force during the impact, and
   the permanent deformation. A 3D infrared camera has been used in order
   to capture the motion of the rod before and after the impact.
   Experimental results for the coefficient of restitution and the rebound
   angular velocity have been compared with the presented models. Selecting
   the appropriate contact model is important on predicting the motion of
   the system for the simulations. For the impact angle theta = 45 degrees
   our previous model matches the experimental results. For the impact
   angle theta = 17.2 degrees it has been shown that all of the presented
   contact models show smaller values for coefficient of restitution and
   rebound angular velocity compare to the experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cracks are the main source of failure in the production of metal parts:
   systems for checking their presence are therefore crucial for

   with a heating tool, a thermocamera, and a robot to handle the part. The
   inspection process is based on the observation of the propagation of
   thermal waves through the inspected part, a method that can highlight
   very small cracks with high reliability. A knowledge-based approach to
   visual inspection is exploited for detecting the cracks: all the system
   parameters are known by means of an accurate calibration of the
   workcell. The system was tested on a large dataset and demonstrated its
   capability of detecting tiny production defects, that can lead to
   dangerous failures when the metal components are put under strong

Abstract = {{The Rosborough approach was developed in the 1980s for the modeling of
   orbit perturbations of altimeter satellites. It is a formalism that is
   rooted in the so-called time-wise approach, in which gravitational
   functionals are described as an along-orbit time series. Nevertheless,
   through a transformation of the orbital variables, the along-orbit
   functional can be mapped back onto the sphere. As such, the Rosborough
   formulation is a so-called space-wise approach at the same time. Both
   the conventional time-wise and the space-wise approaches have been
   improved and optimized over the past decade. When we explore the utility
   of the Rosborough approach in this contribution, we do not expect
   improved solutions for this particular GOCE-based case study. However,
   we aim to show the special characteristics of the Rosborough approach
   for processing the GOCE gradiometry data. In particular, we show that
   this approach can successfully deal with the problems that come with
   real data like bandwidth limitation and mispointing. Based on the first
   71 days of the GOCE gravity gradients, we obtain solutions up till
   spherical harmonic degree 200. Compared to a high-quality
   gradiometric-only time-wise model, our solution shows a similar
   performance with just 8 cm geoid RMS difference in the relevant
   bandwidth. Moreover, relative contributions from the individual
   components are provided for the geographically mean gravity gradient
   components , and , and for the geographically variable gravity gradient
   components and . It is shown that the spatially variable components
   provide a direct access to understanding the mapping of time-variable
   error effects on the sphere. For instance, the known geomagnetic equator
   effect comes out clearly in the variable components of gravity
   gradients, as do track-specific errors. In conclusion, it is
   demonstrated that the Rosborough approach is a complementary method to
   the conventional approaches for GOCE data processing.}},

Abstract = {{This randomized, open label, prospective, observational study compared
   clinical efficacy, safety alongwith plasma BDNF levels in outpatients of
   depression treated with fluoxetine and desvenlafaxine. Patients (aged
   18-60 years) with moderate to severe major depressive disorder (MDD)
   diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
   (HAM-D) score >= 14, who were prescribed fluoxetine or desvenlafaxine
   were included (n = 30 in each group). Patients were followed up for 12
   weeks for evaluation of clinical efficacy, safety along with BDNF
   levels. In the fluoxetine group, HAM-D scores at the start of treatment
   was 19 +/- 4.09 which significantly (p < 0.05) reduced to 9.24 +/- 3.98
   at 12 weeks. In the desvenlafaxine group, HAM-D scores at the start of
   treatment was 18 +/- 3.75 which significantly (p < 0.05) reduced to 10
   +/- 3.75 at 12 weeks. The BDNF levels in the fluoxetine group were
   775.32 +/- 30.38 pg/ml at the start of treatment which significantly (p
   < 0.05) increased to 850.3 +/- 24.92 pg/ml at 12 weeks. The BDNF levels
   in the desvenlafaxine group were 760.5 +/- 28.53 pg/ml at the start of
   treatment which significantly (p < 0.05) increased to 845.8 +/- 32.82
   pg/ml at 12 weeks. Both the antidepressants were found to be safe and
   well tolerated. The efficacy and the safety profile of desvenlafaxine is
   comparable to fluoxetine in patients of MDD. BDNF levels were
   significantly increased post-treatment with both the antidepressive
   agents. Whether BDNF may have a prognostic value in predicting treatment
   response to antidepressant drugs needs to be investigated in a larger
   patient population. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is well documented in many experiments that crystallographic effects
   play an important role in the generation of two-phase patterns during
   the solidification of eutectic alloys. In particular, in lamellar
   composites, large patches of perfectly aligned lamellae are frequently
   observed. Moreover, the growth direction of the lamellae often markedly
   differs from the direction of the temperature gradient (the lamellae are
   tilted with respect to the main growth direction). Both of these effects
   cannot be explained either by the standard theory or the available
   numerical models of eutectic growth, which all assume the interfaces to
   be isotropic. We have developed a phase-field model in which the
   anisotropy of each interface (solid-liquid and solid-solid) can be
   separately controlled, and we have investigated the effect of interface
   anisotropy on the growth dynamics. We have found that anisotropy of the
   solid-solid interphase boundary free energy dramatically alters the
   growth dynamics. Tilted lamellae resulting from the modified equilibrium
   condition at the triple lines, is in good agreement with a theoretical
   conjecture proposed recently. In three dimensions, the interphase
   boundaries tend to align with directions of minimal energy. We have also
   performed simulations in which two grains with different anisotropies
   are in competition. In all cases, the grain containing the boundaries
   with the lowest energies was selected after a transient. These results
   shed new light on the selection of growth patterns in eutectic
   solidification.}},

Title = {{Continuous cardiopulmonary resuscitation training compared to single
   training by laypersons}},
Journal = {{SIGNA VITAE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. Compression-Only Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (COCPR) has
   been broadly studied during the last few years and specially introduced
   into lay rescuers' training. The aim of the study was to compare the
   quality of COCPR performed by laypersons (Group A) who attended a single
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training course, and those (Group B)
   who underwent regular CPR training every 6 months.
   Methods. Both groups completed the ``Heartsaver CPR AED{''} course of
   the American Heart Association. After 30 minutes they were required to
   perform COCPR on a manikin with a skills reporter system.
   Results. Comparing the 76 once only trained laypersons to the 74
   continuously trained lay rescuers, we found that average age (20 versus
   40 years old), male gender (54\% versus 93\%), body mass index (BMI)
   (24.9 versus 27.3 kg/m(2)) and regular physical exercise (55\% versus
   36\%) proved significant predictors, p<0.01, p<0.01, p<0.01 and p=0.04
   respectively. Regarding COCPR-quality, the percentage of efficient chest
   compressions (43\% versus 58\%), average depth of compression (45 versus
   50 mm) and percentage of error-free compressions (36\% versus 50\%)
   indicated a significant statistical difference, with p=0.01, p=0.01 and
   p<0.01 respectively. However, the average frequency of compressions per
   minute (121 versus 124), the percentage of correct hand positioning
   during chest compressions (87\% versus 90\%) and the average duty cycle
   (47\% versus 45\%) did not display a significant difference.
   Conclusion. The continuous CPR training group obtained better results
   regarding quality of chest compressions when compared with single CPR
   training.}},

Abstract = {{Research in traditional education shows chronotype, sleep duration and
   sleep quality to be related to learning performance. Research in adult
   students participating in distance education (DE) is scarce. This study
   aims to provide knowledge on these relationships in this educational
   setting. In an observational longitudinal study, chronotype, sleep
   duration (i.e., for work and free days separately) and sleep quality of
   894 students were analyzed in a multiple regression analyses. Students
   provided information on sleep-related measures and important covariates
   at the start of their study and study progress was evaluated after 14
   months (Le., the number of successfully completed modules). In line with
   previous research, chronotype did not predict study progress. Further,
   sleep duration did not predict study progress, neither as a linear not
   as a polynomial term. Third, sleep quality did not predict study
   progress. Concluding, these results are in line with previous research
   that DE provides a solution to the asynchrony problem. Findings
   regarding sleep duration and sleep quality are new and unexpected,
   asking for attention and further research. Despite the study's
   observational nature, findings suggest that students participating in DE
   may benefit from this type of education as the asynchrony problem
   appears not to apply here, as students can choose their own study
   schedule. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Determine the incidence and risk factors of type 2 diabetes
   in the adult population of Madrid (Spain) and compare the predictive
   models of type 2 diabetes based on the prediabetes criteria of the
   American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the World Health Organisation
   (WHO).
   Material and methods: A prospective study was conducted on a population
   cohort composed of 2048 individuals between 30 and 74 years of age with
   no diabetes. At the start of the study, an epidemiological survey was
   performed, and baseline glycaemia, HbA1c, body mass index and waist
   circumference were measured. A follow-up of 6.4 years was conducted. New
   cases of type 2 diabetes were identified using the electronic primary
   care medical history.
   Results: The incidence of type 2 diabetes was 3.5 cases/1000
   person-years. In the multivariate analysis, the variables that were
   associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes were age, family history of
   diabetes, baseline glycaemia (100-125 mg/dL), HbA1c (5.7-6.4\%) and
   waist circumference (>= 94 cm for men and >= 80 cm for women). Of these,
   the most significantly associated variables were baseline glycaemia and
   HbA1c. The ADA and WHO criteria for defining prediabetes had the same
   predictive capacity.
   Conclusion: The incidence of type 2 diabetes measured in Madrid was
   lower than that found in other population studies, with the
   glucometabolic state the main factor associated with progression to type
   2 diabetes. There were no differences between the prediabetes defined by
   the ADA and the WHO for predicting the onset of the disease. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background The Mediterranean-style dietary pattern has been associated
   with several cardiometabolic benefits, yet no study has assessed the
   potential benefits of this diet in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus
   (T1DM).
   Objective The objective of the present study was to examine the
   association between cardiometabolic profile and alignment of the diet
   with 1) Canadian nutrient recommendations for T1DM in terms of fat,
   protein, carbohydrate, saturated fat, dietary fiber, and sodium and 2) a
   Mediterranean-style dietary pattern among adults with T1DM.
   Design/participants/setting This is a cross-sectional analysis including
   118 adults with T1DM recruited between 2011 and 2013 in Montreal,
   Canada.
   Statistical analyses Body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)), waist
   circumference, truncal fat percentage (dual-energy x-ray
   absorptiometry), blood pressure, and lipid profile values were measured.
   Insulin sensitivity was estimated (estimated glucose disposal rate). A
   3-day food record was completed and physical activity was measured with
   a motion sensor. Differences for the cardiometabolic profile between
   groups with a diet meeting the Canadian nutrient recommendations for
   T1DM (percentage of energy from fat, protein, carbohydrate, saturated
   fat, as well as grams of dietary fiber and milligrams of sodium) or not
   were examined with general linear models. A Mediterranean diet score was
   calculated (range=0 to 44) and Pearson correlations between this score
   and cardiometabolic variables were computed. Significance was set at P
   <= 0.05.
   Results Participants' mean +/- standard deviation age was 44.3 +/- 12.3
   years, glycated hemoglobin was 8.0\%+/- 1.1\%, and Mediterranean diet
   score was 20.2 +/- 5.0. Having a diet that meets at least three
   nutritional recommendations was associated with a lower truncal fat
   percentage (28.0\% vs 32.2\%; P=0.01) only. In contrast, the
   Mediterranean diet score was inversely correlated with body mass index
   (r=-0.30, P=0.002), waist circumference (r=-0.31, P=0.002), truncal fat
   percentage (r=-0.38, P<0.001), systolic (r=-0.20, P=0.03) and diastolic
   blood pressure (r=-0.23, P=0.01), and was directly correlated with
   estimated glucose disposal rate (r=0.22, P=0.03), after adjustments for
   energy intake, sex, and age. The association with estimated glucose
   disposal rate was no longer significant (P=0.055) after adjustment for
   physical activity level.
   Conclusions These results suggest that a higher Mediterrariean diet
   score in the context of T1DM is associated with a favorable
   cardiometabolic profile. Further research is needed to confirm these
   findings.}},

Abstract = {{Competing and overlapping jurisdictions are increasingly relevant in
   international proceedings. This competition needs careful consideration
   because it can result in contradictory decisions and in the
   fragmentation of international law, both in terms of creating conflicts
   between applicable substantive bodies of law and in terms of
   decision-making among different courts. This article seeks first to
   clarify the different kinds of competitions between courts and
   tribunals-specifically, the fundamental distinction between decisional
   and jurisdictional competitions. It then clarifies and assesses exiting
   and the unique and distinct mechanisms used to address them to conclude
   that so far they have been successful in avoiding fragmentation. In the
   third part, this article focuses on the issues connected to partial
   overlap and argues that it may be usefully appraised by a framework
   constructed on the application of the principles of enhanced judicial
   dialogue, comity and judicial restraint.}},

Abstract = {{Each year a considerable amount of money is spent in the production of
   several national and international University rankings that may deeply
   influence the students' enrollment. However, all such rankings are based
   almost exclusively on numerical indicators weakly related to the quality
   of the learning process and do not consider the perceptions of the ``end
   users{''}, i.e. the learners. Recently, as part of the activity promoted
   by the ASLERD (Association for Smart Learning Ecosystems and Regional
   Development), we have developed an alternative approach to benchmark
   learning ecosystems. Such novel approach is based on: a) the detection
   of the degree of satisfaction related to the levels of the Maslow's
   Pyramid of needs, and b) the detection of indicators related with the
   achievement of the state of ``flow{''} by the actors involved in the
   learning processes. In this paper we report on the first implementation
   of such benchmarking approach that involved six European Campuses and
   more than 700 students. The critical analysis of the outcomes allowed us
   to identify: a) the set of the most relevant indicators; b) a
   ``smartness{''} axis in the plan of the first two principal components
   derived by applying a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the spaces
   of the selected indicators.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1940, we can observe an inflection point in the Argentinean puppet
   theatre development initiating an experimentation and variety of stage
   proposals period, whose responsible and protagonist will be the
   generation known as the ``first generation{''} of puppeteers. To
   understand the importance of this expansion, as well as the discipline's
   particular features, we need to understand its antecedents. In this
   work, we attend to outline a map of the puppet theatre in Buenos Aires,
   before the first generation emergence. We'll focus in two previous
   moments, as well as in this generation configuration: the first one
   spans the city colonial period and it's signed by the relationship with
   Spain and the puppeteers' sporadic work, the second one, goes from 1810
   and ends in the first decades of the 20th century, being its principal
   feature the puppets' marginal place, on one hand, concerning to its
   location in the city periphery and, in the other, concerning to the
   appropriation by the leftists movements. Finally, between 1930-1940, we
   can notice the beginning of a new period signed by the rising of the
   first generation of Argentinean puppeteers and their attempts of making
   their work continuous and visible. We'll focus in the origin of these
   artists that came from other arts.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of
   benazepril and losartan on endothelial function and vascular stiffness,
   in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
   Materials and methods: We included hypertensive diabetic patients with
   an office systolic blood pressure (BP) 130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP 80
   mmHg. Patients were rolled over to amlodipine for 6 weeks, then we
   performed C-reactive protein assays, BP measurement and vascular tests;
   next, patients were randomized to benazepril or losartan. The tests were
   repeated after 12 weeks.
   Results: We randomized 14 patients to benazepril and 16 to losartan.
   There were no differences in systolic (139 versus 134 mmHg, p = 0.618)
   and diastolic (82 versus 80 mmHg, p = 0.950) BP at the end of the study.
   C-reactive protein values were lower in the benazepril group (0.38
   versus 0.42 mg/dl, p = 0.020). There was a slightly higher flow-mediated
   vasodilation (FMD) response in the benazepril group (45\% increase, p =
   0.057) than in the losartan group (19\% increase, p = 0.132). Both
   central systolic BP (129 versus 123 mmHg, p = 0.934) and carotid-femoral
   pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) (8.5 versus 8.5 m/s, p = 0.280) were the
   same between groups.
   Conclusions: Hypertensive diabetic patients using benazepril had a
   greater reduction in C-reactive protein, and a slight improvement in
   FMD, than those taking losartan.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo compare early outcomes between Direct Flow Medical (DFM)
   and 1(st)-generation transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
   devices.
   BackgroundThe effectiveness of new-generation TAVR devices compared with
   earlier generations is unclear.
   Methods and ResultsOverall, 496 patients treated between November 2007
   and March 2014 were included: 44 (8.7\%) treated with DFM, 179 (36.9\%)
   with Medtronic CoreValve (MCV) and 273 (54.4\%) with Edwards Sapien /
   Sapien XT (SXT) valve. Because of differences in baseline
   characteristics, propensity-score matching among patients treated in the
   same time span (March 2012-March 2014) was performed. The primary
   objective was the VARC-2 device success composite endpoint.
   Propensity-score matching identified 41 patients in each group. A higher
   device success composite endpoint was observed in DFM (DFM 97.6\% vs.
   MCV 65.9\% vs. SXT 92.7\%; P<0.001). This was attributed to a
   significantly lower incidence of moderate-to-severe post-procedural
   aortic regurgitation (AR; 2.4\% vs. 22\% vs. 7.3\%; P<0.001), lower rate
   of valve embolization (0\% vs. 7.3\% vs. 0\%; 0.041) and need for a 2nd
   valve implantation (0\% vs. 7.3\% vs. 0\%; P=0.041).
   ConclusionsDFM was associated with higher rates of device success and a
   lower incidence of post-procedural AR. New generation devices appear to
   address several of the limitations of earlier generation devices. (J

Abstract = {{While several ``grand narratives{''} have been developed to account for
   the impact of scientific things on scientific practice, there is still
   very little methodological support for comparative analyses of
   scientific things. The goal of our article is to sketch the
   methodological challenges involved in comparatively analyzing scientific
   things and including their properties in middle-range theories of
   scientific practice. Methodological challenges arise from the necessity
   to use scientists' accounts of scientific things, the dilemma between
   depth and breadth of comparative case-study approaches, and from the
   necessity to compare accounts of scientific things to each other as well
   as to social conditions of research. Since the dominant approaches to
   the study of scientific things avoid the middle levels of abstraction,
   we suggest using an approach based on a theory of action. Two examples
   from a recent study of conditions for scientific innovations illustrate
   our approach to the comparative analysis of properties of scientific
   things.}},

Title = {{From ``doing history' to thinking historically: Historical consciousness
   across History and International Relations}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Although most attempts to foster interdisciplinary dialogue are located
   outside mainstream International Relations (IR), this article seeks to
   problematize how the two dominant paradigms of IR theory, realism and
   liberalism, think historically. The argument proceeds by examining how
   the disciplines consider what historical knowledge is useful for, that
   is, how they think historically or are historically conscious. This
   constitutes a shift away from the dominant dialogue over how to do
   history' in IR. Historical consciousness is defined as the understanding
   of the temporality of historical experience or how past, present and
   future are thought to be connected. The analysis is set up to explore
   the extent to which both disciplines share a similar historical
   consciousness beyond merely treating history as instructive. To do so
   the article first examines the canon of European historiography to
   identify three genres of historical consciousness: history as teacher,
   history as narrative, history as representation. This survey of
   pre-positivist historiography serves to show the complexity of
   historical reflection within that discipline, something against which
   variance within IR theory can also be compared. Disciplinary comparison
   reveals that three genres of historical consciousness are present in
   liberalism and realism: lessons of history, revenge of history, and
   among progressive realists a speculative escape from history genre.
   Whereas lessons of history spans both isms' in IR, realism is shown to
   have a more complex understanding of temporality, thereby providing
   another conceptual starting point for distinguishing between these two
   traditions'. Moreover, these differences between genres of historical
   consciousness used within realism capture the split between realists
   that lies not in the origin of anarchy itself but in how realists think
   historically. What emerges, therefore, by comparing how disciplines
   think historically rather than do' History, is the equally purposive or
   even political use of the historical knowledge they produce.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundHypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a heterogeneous,
   lethal combination of congenital malformations characterized by severe
   underdevelopment of left heart structures, resulting in a univentricular
   circulation. The genetic determinants of this disorder are largely
   unknown. Evidence of copy number variants (CNVs) contributing to the
   genetic etiology of HLHS and other congenital heart defects has been
   mounting. However, the functional effects of such CNVs have not been
   examined, particularly in cases where the variant of interest is found
   in only a single patient.
   Methods and ResultsWhole-genome SNP microarrays were employed to detect
   CNVs in two patient cohorts (N = 70 total) predominantly diagnosed with
   some form of nonsyndromic HLHS. We discovered 16 rare or private
   variants adjacent to or overlapping 20 genes associated with
   cardiovascular or premature lethality phenotypes in mouse knockout
   models. We evaluated the impact of selected variants on the expression
   of nine of these genes through quantitative PCR on cDNA derived from
   patient heart tissue. Four genes displayed significantly altered
   expression in patients with an overlapping or proximal CNV verses
   patients without such CNVs.
   ConclusionRare and private genomic imbalances perturb transcription of
   genes that potentially affect cardiogenesis in a subset of nonsyndromic
   HLHS patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To assess changes following treatment and the reliability and
   responsiveness to change of the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology
   (OMERACT) Psoriatic Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (PsAMRIS)
   in a randomized controlled trial.
   Methods. Forty patients with PsA randomized to either placebo or
   abatacept (ABA) had MRI of either 1 hand (n = 20) or 1 foot (n = 20) at
   baseline and after 6 months. Images were scored blindly twice by 3
   independent readers according to the PsAMRIS (for synovitis,
   tenosynovitis, periarticular inflammation, bone edema, bone erosion, and
   bone proliferation).
   Results. Inflammatory features improved numerically but statistically
   nonsignificantly in the ABA group but not the placebo group. Baseline
   intrareader intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were good (>=
   0.50) to very good (>= 0.80) for all features in both hand and foot.
   Baseline interreader ICC were good (ICC 0.72-0.96) for all features,
   except periarticular inflammation and bone proliferation in the hand and
   tenosynovitis in the foot (ICC 0.25-0.44). Intrareader and interreader
   ICC for change scores varied. Guyatt's responsiveness index (GRI) was
   high for inflammatory features in the hand and metatarsophalangeal
   joints (GRI -0.67 to -3.13; bone edema not calculable). Minimal change
   and low prevalence resulted in low ICC and GRI for bone damage.
   Conclusion. PsAMRIS showed overall good intrareader agreement in the
   hand and foot, and inflammatory feature scores were responsive to
   change, suggesting that PsAMRIS may be a valid tool for MRI assessment
   of hands and feet in PsA clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an experimental study testing the reuse of design knowledge
   as a method to support learning and use of parametric design in
   architecture. The use of parametric design systems and programming
   environments offer architects new opportunities, providing a powerful
   means to create geometries and allowing dynamic design exploration, but
   it can also impose substantial challenges. The proposition tested in
   this study is that the reuse of design knowledge can improve architects'
   ability to use parametric modelling, and reduce the barriers to using
   programming in a design context. The paper explores and compares two
   approaches as a means of accessing and reusing existing design
   solutions: the reuse of abstract parametric `Design Patterns' {[}1]; and
   secondly the reuse of parametric solutions from specific design cases
   (Case-Based Design). This paper outlines the principles and methods of
   `abstract' versus `case-based' approaches to reuse parametric solutions;
   and focuses on the results of their practical implementation through the
   statistical analysis of a comparative study involving 126 designers. In
   conclusion, it is proposed the outcomes from this study can be applied
   to inform the methodology for introducing parametric design in
   architecture and design disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{Since the Fukushima disaster in Japan in March 2011, safety concerns

   power industry. We use a global general equilibrium model to calculate
   regional electricity prices that are matching demand with the
   constrained power supply after the nuclear power phase out. Nuclear
   power exit in Germany and Switzerland might increase electricity prices
   in Europe moderately by 2-3 \% early on to 4-5 \% by 2035 if
   transmission capacity within the region is sufficient. In a gradual and

Abstract = {{The frequency following response (FFR) is a scalp-recorded measure of
   phase-locked brainstem activity to stimulus-related periodicities. Three
   experiments investigated the specificity of the FFR for carrier and
   modulation frequency using adaptation. FFR waveforms evoked by
   alternating-polarity stimuli were averaged for each polarity and added,
   to enhance envelope, or subtracted, to enhance temporal fine structure
   information. The first experiment investigated peristimulus adaptation
   of the FFR for pure and complex tones as a function of stimulus
   frequency and fundamental frequency (F0). It showed more adaptation of
   the FFR in response to sounds with higher frequencies or F0s than to
   sounds with lower frequency or F0s. The second experiment investigated
   tuning to modulation rate in the FFR. The FFR to a complex tone with a
   modulation rate of 213 Hz was not reduced more by an adaptor that had
   the same modulation rate than by an adaptor with a different modulation
   rate (90 or 504 Hz), thus providing no evidence that the FFR originates
   mainly from neurons that respond selectively to the modulation rate of
   the stimulus. The third experiment investigated tuning to audio
   frequency in the FFR using pure tones. An adaptor that had the same
   frequency as the target (213 or 504 Hz) did not generally reduce the FFR
   to the target more than an adaptor that differed in frequency (by 1.24
   octaves). Thus, there was no evidence that the FFR originated mainly
   from neurons tuned to the frequency of the target. Instead, the results
   are consistent with the suggestion that the FFR for low-frequency pure
   tones at medium to high levels mainly originates from neurons tuned to
   higher frequencies. Implications for the use and interpretation of the
   FFR are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In many wave energy concepts, power output in the MW range requires the
   simultaneous operation of many wave energy converters. In particular,
   this is true for small point-absorbers, where a wave energy farm may
   contain several hundred devices. The total performance of the farm is
   affected by the hydrodynamic interactions between the individual
   devices, and reliable tools that can model full farms are needed to
   study power output and find optimal design parameters. This paper
   presents a novel method to model the hydrodynamic interactions and power
   output of very large wave energy farms. The method is based on
   analytical multiple scattering theory and uses time series of irregular
   wave amplitudes to compute the instantaneous power of each device. An
   interaction distance cut-off is introduced to improve the computational
   cost with acceptable accuracy. As an application of the method, wave
   energy farms with over 100 devices are studied in the MW range using one
   month of wave data measured at an off-shore site.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: As lung cancer screening with low-dose CT scanning is
   implemented, an increasing number of people will be diagnosed with
   pulmonary nodules. Primary care clinicians care for the vast majority of
   these patients, but their experiences with communication and managing
   distress in this population are not well understood.
   METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews of 15 primary care
   providers (PCPs) at two academic medical centers who care for patients
   with pulmonary nodules. We used qualitative description analysis,
   focusing on clinicians' information exchange and other communication
   behaviors.
   RESULTS: Most PCPs believed they had inadequate information to counsel
   patients regarding lung nodules, although this information is desired.
   PCPs were concerned patients could ``fall through the cracks{''} but did
   not have access to a reliable system to ensure follow-up adherence. They
   were limited by time, knowledge, and resources in providing the
   preferred level of care. Most PCPs did not discuss the specific risk a
   nodule was lung cancer, in part because they did not have ready access
   to this information. PCPs believed most patients did not have
   substantial distress as a result of nodule detection. Most PCPs did not
   include patients when making decisions about the follow-up plan.
   CONCLUSIONS: PCPs oft en lack systemic resources to optimize
   patient-centered approaches when discussing incidental pulmonary nodules
   with patients. With the advent of lung cancer screening, pulmonologists
   can assist primary care colleagues by providing accurate information to
   counsel patients and assisting in managing conversations about the risk
   of cancer. Pulmonologists should support efforts to implement reliable
   systems to ensure adherence to follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Friction conditions at the contact of bodies are connected with the
   structure of the contact area, in particular, with occurring the
   products of their destruction or severe deformation in this area such
   that further interaction of bodies takes place through the elements of
   the structure of an intermediate layer. A mechanism of internal motions
   in the intermediate layer which can alter its structure at friction is
   demonstrated and analyzed in the paper. The conditions and basic
   mechanism adjusting the formation of the structure at the interface at
   friction are determined. The interaction between the bodies is carried
   out by rolling between the structural elements of the intermediate layer
   (balls). Loads from contacting bodies lead to the convergence of balls
   with increasing total tangential displacements. This process is
   represented as an analog of the transformed (viscous) friction, whereby
   when the body is moved with friction on the surface under the action of
   some force then the appearance of an additional force of another
   direction is also accompanied by the displacement of the body in the
   direction of this force no matter how small it may be. This approach can
   be extended for an analysis of a system of blocks in the intermediate
   layer if their relative motion occurs in the sliding regime. An
   analytical model of convergence of the rolling elements at the interface
   under shear with compression on the basis of the laws of the transformed
   (viscous) friction was suggested. The model was confirmed
   experimentally. It is shown that the rate of convergence does not depend
   on the direction of the main drawing together of contacting bodies. The
   speed of convergence increases with the decreasing the distance between
   the balls until they touch. The described process represents a basis for
   the scenario of the particles grouping in the intermediate layer and
   aligning them into compact formations. Accounting for this phenomenon
   can be useful for technological processes such as chemical-mechanical
   polishing. Mutual influence and motion of abrasive particles, formation
   of their conglomerates can change the intensity of their action on the
   treated surface.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Clinical philosophy (CP) is an approach to the treatment of mental
   disorders. The goal of the present study is to put CP to a first
   empirical testing.
   Method: I present a case of a patient with paranoid schizophrenia
   comorbid with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that did not respond
   to conventional, standard cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). Using a
   single-case pre-test/post-test design, a CP approach was developed
   drawing heavily on existentialist and philosophy-oriented writers.
   Results: The client responded well to this novel treatment approach.
   Above all, levels of intolerance of uncertainty improved greatly from
   pre-to post-treatment. A decrease in overall illness severity as well as
   specific psychopathological variables such as obsessive-compulsive
   symptoms, depression and anxiety could be observed.
   Conclusion: Results are discussed in terms of the underlying mechanism
   of the CP approach. An account of the underlying mechanism of efficacy,
   understood as a tripartite function, is introduced. CP as a
   philosophy-oriented method within the broader framework of third wave
   CBT and existential analysis is considered.}},

   diseases undergoing medical rehabilitation provided by the German
   Statutory Pension Insurance Mitteldeutschland (GSPI MD), who are
   potentially affected by severe restrictions of work ability (SRWA).
   Methods: Administrative data from GSPI MD were analyzed (secondary data
   analysis). The proportion of indications for SRWA (unemployment at
   application of rehabilitation, duration of sick leave >3 months before
   onset of rehabilitation, working capacity <6 h/day in the last job
   evaluated at discharge and/or application for temporary disability
   benefits) was examined among insured persons undergoing medical
   rehabilitation in the year 2011.
   Results: Two thirds (65 \%) of the analyzed sample (N = 25 658) had at
   least one indicator for SWRA (cardiology: 56 \%; orthopedics: 65 \%;
   neurology: 72 \%; psychosomatics: 74 \%). The majority of identified
   cases of SRWA (92 \%) was defined by long periods of sick leave and/or a

Abstract = {{Tupinambis teguixin, the common tegu, is the only species of the genus
   found in Venezuela. It is distributed in different bioregions in the
   Neotropics, some of them separated by geographic barriers that may
   restrict gene flow among populations. Thus, to assess this possibility,
   we tested the Paleogeographic hypothesis and the Riverine hypothesis for
   the divergence among populations. To this end, we evaluated the degree
   of genetic structuring in six populations of T. teguixin from Venezuela,
   plus one from Brazil and one from Ecuador. We used two molecular
   datasets, one with the populations from Venezuela (Venezuela dataset, 1
   023 bp) and one including the other two (South America dataset, 665 bp),
   with 93 and 102 concatenated sequences from cytochrome b and ND4, and
   38/37 haplotypes. We used three measures of genetic diversity:
   nucleotide diversity, haplotype diversity and number of polymorphic
   sites. Gene flow was estimated with the statistic Phi(ST) and paired
   F-ST values. We also constructed a haplotype network. We found genetic
   structuring with (1) Phi(ST) = 0.83; (2) high paired F-ST estimates
   (0.54 - 0.94); (3) haplotype networks with a well-defined geographic
   pattern; and (4) a single shared haplotype. The genetic structure does
   not seem to stem from geographic distance (r = 0.282, p = 0.209), but
   rather the product of an historic biogeographic event with the Merida
   Andes and the Orinoco River (71.2 \% of the molecular variance) as
   barriers. We propose the Zulia population as an Evolutionary Significant
   Unit and that the other populations be temporarily considered Management
   Units, pending further data. Populations Delta and Guri should form a
   single Management Unit since they share a haplotype.}},

Abstract = {{The stable isotopes of water were used to improve the determination of
   the groundwater budget of the deep Saharan ``Continental
   Intercalaire{''} (CI), a deep confined aquifer. Mixing processes between
   the CI and shallower aquifers have been described in several regional
   studies over the last few decades, based on observed isotopic
   differences between local water masses. Here, we improve the
   quantitative determination of the discharge flux of this aquifer in one
   of its main outlet regions, the Djeffara plain in Tunisia, based on
   geostatistics and a simple mass balance mixing model, applied before and
   after the beginning of extensive pumping in the 1970s. First, the
   average values of delta O-18 and delta H-2 were precisely documented in
   the mixing zone between Cl water and the local recharge, based on
   conditional simulations using spatially distributed isotopic data.
   Together with the available estimate of local recharge and conservative
   hypotheses on the isotopic end-members, we estimate the discharge flux
   of the Cl in the Djeffara plain at 1.78 +/- 1.03 m(3) s(-1) in 1970,
   probably near natural steady-state, reduced to 1.02 +/- 0.58 m(3) s(-1)
   in 2004 under strong anthropogenic pressure, related to the drastic
   increase in pumping rates in the deep Cl aquifer during this period.
   Considering the general groundwater budget over the entire CI aquifer,
   we estimate a recharge value of 5.13 m(3) s(-1), or 6.5 mm yr(-1) over
   the 25,000 km(2) of recharge area in the Saharan Atlas. This value is in
   line with the evaluation of 2.1 mm yr(-1) obtained recently from the
   GRACE satellite gravity data for the overall outcrops considering that
   recharge occurs mostly in the Atlas region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: This work describes the genetic characterization of
   Cryptosporidium and Giardia involved in an outbreak in a nursery school
   in Granada, Spain, that affected seven children under the age of 4.
   Methods: Nucleic acids were extracted from the seven stool samples
   positive to Cryptosporidium or Giardia by microscopy and/or
   immunochromatography. The species and subtypes of Cryptosporidium were
   identified by PCR-RFLP and PCR of the SSUrRNA and gp60 genes,
   respectively. The assemblages of Giardia duodenalis isolates were
   characterized by PCR of the tpi gene. PCR products were sequenced and
   analyzed.
   Results: All of the isolates were positive for Cryptosporidium hominis.
   Five of them belonged to subtype IaA11R2, one to subtype IbA10G2R2, and
   the other could not be identified. Three of these samples were positive
   for G. duodenalis by PCR, two belonging to the assemblage A, and the
   other one to assemblage B. Discussion: This is the first report of
   Cyptosporidium hominis subtype IaA11R2 as a cause of an outbreak in
   Europe where subtype IbA10G2R2 is the most frequently identified. In the
   case of Giardia, an outbreak could not be confirmed because of the low
   number of positive samples and the low genetic variability of the
   amplified fragments for assemblage A of tpi gene.
   Conclusions: A new subtype, of Cryptosporidium hominis named IaA11R2,
   has been described as a cause of an outbreak in a nursery school in
   Granada, Spain. However an outbreak of giardiasis could not be
   confirmed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. and Sociedad Espanola de

Abstract = {{Erlotinib (ERL) is a drug used in epidermoid carcinoma treatment. One of
   the ERL drawbacks is low water solubility, which limits its use in the
   development of safer and effective formulations. The present study used
   the strategy of inclusion complexation with
   hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) to increase the ERL water
   solubility, characterize the inclusion complex physico-chemically, and
   evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antiangiogenic effect.
   The data showed 1:1 molar ratio ERL:HP-beta-CD inclusion complex
   formation both in solution and in solid state. Phase-solubility analysis
   showed A(L)-type diagrams. Isothermal titrations calorimetry and nuclear
   Overhauser effect spectroscopy also support that formation. Despite free
   ERL higher cytotoxicity, higher values were associated with the complex
   compared with free ERL (37.5 A mu M), and the complex was more cytotoxic
   to A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cell than to osteoblasts
   (non-cancerous cells). In addition, the inclusion complex exhibited
   antiangiogenic activity without affecting the activation and recruitment
   of neutrophils and macrophage. Overall, these results suggest that the
   ERL:HP-beta-CD inclusion complex could be a promising approach for
   developing safe and effective ERL formulation by different routes of
   administration.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium dioxide Pickering stabilized methyl methacrylate/n-butyl
   acrylate (MMA/BA) copolymer latexes were synthesized by miniemulsion

   concentration, the smaller the particle size. The hybrid latexes formed
   coherent films with honey comb structures, the opacity of the films
   increased with the amount of TiO2. The photocatalytic activity of the
   hybrid films was assessed by coating concrete specimens and analyzing
   the capabilities to degrade Rhodamine B under UV-light exposure. The
   films showed excellent self-cleaning activity and it was found that the
   photocatalytic activity index was little affected by the concentration
   of TiO2 and the roughness of the film. The kinetic of the photocatalytic
   reaction was controlled by the diffusion of the Rhodamine B from the
   inner of the film to the interface. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Antimicrobials are commonly used to treat diseases in dairy cows and in
   calves. In Argentina information about veterinary antimicrobial usage at
   herd level is still limited. The purpose of this study was to quantify
   antimicrobial usage at herd level of most used drugs to treat lactating
   cows (LC) and preweaned calves (PWC). Prevalence of diseases and
   antimicrobial drug usage in 18 milking herds and in 11 calves rearing
   units (CRUs) were assessed through a survey. Drug usage (DU) at herd
   level was estimated through a standardized indicator, the number of
   Defined Daily Doses Animal (DDDA) per year, considering a standardized
   body weight of 600 kg for LC and of 60 kg for PWC. Pearson correlation
   coefficients were estimated and used to evaluate the association of LC
   herd size and milk yield (kg/day) with each disease prevalence and with
   DU. Student t-Test was used to compare disease prevalence and DU with
   various management practices in CRUs. Clinical mastitis was the most
   prevalent disease followed by foot, uterine and respiratory diseases in
   adult dairy cows. More involvement of veterinarians in treatment
   decisions was observed in larger dairy herds. Most used antimicrobials
   were beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. Especially for intramammary
   compounds, there was a trend towards multidrug formulations. The median
   DU was 5.21 DDDA/LC/year (range = 2.88-10.88), the intramammary usage
   for clinical mastitis (IM-CM) and dry cow therapy (IM-DRY), representing
   85.4\% of total drug usage. No significant correlations were observed
   between herd size or milk yield with disease prevalence and with DU for
   all considered uses (IM-CM, IM-DRY and parental (PAR)). Enteritis was
   reported in all CRUs, followed by respiratory disease (91\%), and
   omphalophlebitis (3\%). The median DU for all drugs used at CRU level
   was 0.49 DDDA/PWC/year. Prevalences and DU for treatment of enteritis
   and respiratory diseases did not differ significantly between rearing
   systems, colostrum management or permanence time of the calf with the
   mother after birth. Although it was possible to estimate the drug usage
   at farm level, it was observed that the diversity of drug compounds and
   dose heterogeneity presented by the various manufacturers made the
   calculation of those indicators complex. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{BRAFV600E is a unique molecular marker for metastatic melanoma, being
   the most frequent somatic point mutation in this malignancy. Detection
   of BRAFV600E in blood could have prognostic and predictive value and
   could be useful for monitoring response to BRAF-targeted therapy. We
   developed a rapid, sensitive method for the detection and quantification
   of BRAFV600E in circulating free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma and
   serum on the basis of a quantitative 5-nuclease PCR (Taqman) in the
   presence of a peptide-nucleic acid. We validated the assay in 92 lung,
   colon, and melanoma archival serum and plasma samples with paired tumor
   tissue (40 wild-type and 52 BRAFV600E). The correlation of cfDNA
   BRAFV600E with clinical parameters was further explored in 22 metastatic
   melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. Our assay could detect
   and quantify BRAFV600E in mixed samples with as little as 0.005\% mutant
   DNA (copy number ratio 1:20000), with a specificity of 100\% and a
   sensitivity of 57.7\% in archival serum and plasma samples. In 22
   melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitors, the median
   progression-free survival was 3.6 months for those showing BRAFV600E in
   pretreatment cfDNA compared with 13.4 months for those in whom the
   mutation was not detected (P=0.021). Moreover, the median overall
   survival for positive versus negative BRAFV600E tests in pretreatment
   cfDNA differed significantly (7 vs. 21.8 months, P=0.017). This finding
   indicates that the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of
   low-abundance BRAFV600E alleles in cfDNA using our assay can be useful
   for predicting treatment outcome. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer

Abstract = {{Peptides with antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory capacities have been
   obtained from a plum processing by-product. The aim of this work was to
   fractionate most active plum hydrolysates, to identify peptides in these
   fractions, and to evaluate their resistance to gastrointestinal enzymes.
   Highest antioxidant capacity was observed in the whole Alcalase
   hydrolysate while peptides yielding the highest ability to inhibit ACE
   were concentrated in the fraction <3 kDa from the Thermolysin
   hydrolysate. RP-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS enabled the identification of 13 and 7
   potential antioxidant and ACE inhibitory peptides, respectively, in
   these fractions. Nevertheless, RP-HPLC alone did not guarantee the
   successful separation of all peptides. The combination of RP-HPLC and
   hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled to
   ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS enabled the identification of all peptides. Five
   potential antioxidant and three potential antihypertensive peptides
   could be additionally identified by HILIC. A total of 7 potential
   antioxidant peptides and 3 potential antihypertensive peptides resisted
   a simulated gastrointestinal digestion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{BMS-914392 is a tricyclic pyranoquinoline BCS class 2 weak base that
   demonstrates high solubility in low pH environments. Initial clinical
   studies indicated that rapid release of high dose BMS-914392 led to
   transient adverse events associated with peak plasma concentrations. A
   modified release (MR) formulation strategy was proposed to suppress the
   peak blood concentration and maintain total exposure to overcome the
   adverse effects. Three modified release prototype formulations were
   developed and tested via a USP 3 dissolution method to verify that each
   formulation can effectively slow the release of BMS-914392. A
   pharmacokinetic (PK) absorption model was employed to guide the
   formulation development and selection. Simulations showed good agreement
   with plasma levels measured after oral dosing in dogs. Identification of
   key formulation factors to achieve release rates suitable for blunting
   peak blood levels without diminishing exposure were achieved through
   combined preclinical data and use of GastroPlus simulations. PK
   absorption model refinements based on phase 1 data, dog pharmacokinetic
   results, and in vitro data provided reliable predictions of human
   absorption profiles and variability in patients. All three prototype
   formulations demonstrated lower maximum plasma concentrations of
   BMS-914392 and maintained satisfactory relative bioavailability. Both
   the PK absorption model and subsequent clinical data indicated that an
   acidified hydrophilic matrix MR formulation had the greatest potential
   to reduce the incidence of adverse events and showed the best exposure
   profile in fasted state healthy subjects with and without famotidine
   coadministration. The risk based development process achieved successful
   screening and selection of a suitable modified release formulation to
   enable clinical efficacy trials.}},

Title = {{A Novel Mooring Tether for Highly-Dynamic Offshore Applications;
   Mitigating Peak and Fatigue Loads via Selectable Axial Stiffness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Highly-dynamic floating bodies such as wave energy convertors require
   mooring lines with particular mechanical properties; the mooring system
   must achieve adequate station keeping whilst controlling mooring
   tensions within acceptable limits. Optimised compliant mooring systems
   can meet these requirements but where compliance is achieved through
   system architecture, the complexity of the system increases together
   with the mooring footprint. This work introduces the ``Exeter
   Tether{''}, a novel fibre rope mooring tether providing advantages over
   conventional fibre ropes. The tether concept aims to provide a
   significantly lower axial stiffness by de-coupling this attribute from
   the minimum breaking load of the line. A benefit of reduced axial
   stiffness is the reduction of mooring system stiffness providing a
   reduction of peak and fatigue loads, without increasing mooring system
   complexity. Reducing these loads improves system reliability and allows
   a reduction in mass of both the mooring system and the floating body,
   thus reducing costs. The principles behind the novel tether design are
   presented here, along with an outline of eight prototype tether
   variants. Results from the proof of concept study are given together
   with preliminary findings from sea trials conducted in Falmouth Bay.
   Results demonstrate that the Exeter Tether can be configured to achieve
   a significantly lower axial stiffness than conventional fibre rope and
   that the stiffness is selectable within limits for a given breaking
   strength. Strain values greater than 0.35 are achieved at 30\% of line
   breaking strength; this represents more than a threefold increase of the
   strain achievable with a conventional rope of the same material. The
   tether was subjected to six months of sea trials to establish any
   threats to its own reliability and to inform future design enhancements
   in this respect.}},

Abstract = {{In many neurodegenerative diseases, the accumulation of characteristic
   proteins into insoluble aggregates in or among selectively vulnerable
   neurons and glial cells follow neuroanatomical rules in a highly
   predictable manner. The underlying pathological process of amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by sequential corticofugal
   axonal spread in 4 stages. The in vivo transfer of these autopsy-based
   neuropathological findings constitutes a challenge. Diffusion tensor
   imaging of the brain allows for individual analysis of predefined tract
   structures, thus making it possible to image in vivo the disease stages
   in ALS. In addition, impaired eye movement control as one consequence of
   disturbed cortical and subcortical brain networks permits
   characterization of a behavioral staging scheme consistent with the
   neuropathological model. The staging patterns in ALS have thus been
   transferred into clinically applicable techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Neural precursor cells (NPCs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells
   (hPSCs) represent an attractive tool for the in vitro generation of
   various neural cell types. However, the developmentally early NPCs
   emerging during hPSC differentiation typically show a strong propensity
   for neuronal differentiation, with more limited potential for generating
   astrocytes and, in particular, for generating oligodendrocytes. This
   phenomenon corresponds well to the consecutive and protracted generation
   of neurons and GLIA during normal human development. To obtain a more
   gliogenic NPC type, we combined growth factor-mediated expansion with
   pre-exposure to the differentiation-inducing agent retinoic acid and
   subsequent immunoisolation of CD133-positive cells. This protocol yields
   an adherent and self-renewing population of hindbrain/spinal cord radial
   glia (RG)-like neural precursor cells (RGL-NPCs) expressing typical
   neural stem cell markers such as nestin, ASCL1, SOX2, and PAX6 as well
   as RG markers BLBP, GLAST, vimentin, and GFAP. While RGL-NPCs maintain
   the ability for tripotential differentiation into neurons, astrocytes,
   and oligodendrocytes, they exhibit greatly enhanced propensity for
   oligodendrocyte generation. Under defined differentiation conditions
   promoting the expression of the major oligodendrocyte fate-determinants
   OLIG1/2, NKX6.2, NKX2.2, and SOX10, RGL-NPCs efficiently convert into
   NG2-positive oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) and are
   subsequently capable of in vivo myelination. Representing a stable
   intermediate between PSCs and OPCs, RGL-NPCs expedite the generation of
   PSC-derived oligodendrocytes with O4-, 4860-, and myelin basic protein
   (MBP)-positive cells that already appear within 7 weeks following growth
   factor withdrawal-induced differentiation. Thus, RGL-NPCs may serve as
   robust tool for time-efficient generation of human oligodendrocytes from
   embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells.}},

   Insights on isostatic dynamics along the Atlantic coasts of

Abstract = {{This study presents new Relative Sea Level (RSL) data that were obtained
   in the Finistere region (Western tip of Brittany, France) and the
   implications those data have for the understanding of the isostatic
   dynamics across north-western Europe, and more specifically along the
   Atlantic and Channel coasts. New stratigraphic sequences were obtained
   and analyzed to derive 24 new Sea-level Index Points, in which 6 are
   basal. These new data considerably increase the knowledge we have of the
   RSL evolution along the coasts of Western Brittany since the last 8 kyr
   B.P. From this new dataset, RSL was estimated to rise continuously over
   the last 8 kyr with a major inflection at ca. 6 kyr cal. BP. Our results
   show large vertical discrepancies between the RSL records of Brittany
   and South-Western UK, with the latter plotting several meters below the
   new data. From this comparison we suggest that the two regions underwent
   a very different pattern and/or amplitude of subsidence during the last
   8 kyr which has implications for the spatial and temporal pattern of the
   peripheral bulge of the European ice sheets. We compared our data
   against predictions from Glacio-Isostatic Adjustment models (GIA
   models). There are large misfits between RSL observations and the
   predictions of the global (ICE-5G (VM2a) - Peltier, 2004, GLAC1-b -
   Tarasov and Peltier, 2002; Tarasov et al., 2012, Briggs et al., 2014)
   and regional UK models ({''}BIIS{''} - Bradley et al., 2009; Bradley et
   al., 2011; ``Kuchar{''}- Kuchar et al., 2012), which can't be resolved
   through significant changes to the deglaciation history and size of the
   British Irish Ice sheet. Paleo-tidal modelling corrections indicate
   regional changes in the tidal ranges played a negligible role in the
   data-model misfits. Hence, we propose that the misfits are due to some
   combination of: (i) unaccounted mass-loss of far-field ice-sheets
   (Antarctic ice-Sheet or Laurentide Ice-Sheet), (ii) unresolved
   differences in the deglaciation history and size of the Fennoscandian
   Ice sheet or, more likely, (iii) significant lateral variations in the
   Earth's structure across the English Channel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study assessed whether community mobilization and interventions to
   improve emergency obstetric and newborn care reduced perinatal mortality
   (PMR) and neonatal mortality rates (NMR) in Belgaum, India.
   The cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in Belgaum
   District, Karnataka State, India. Twenty geographic clusters were
   randomized to control or the intervention. The intervention engaged and
   mobilized community and health authorities to leverage support;
   strengthened community-based stabilization, referral, and
   transportation; and aimed to improve quality of care at facilities.
   17,754 Intervention births and 15,954 control births weighing a parts
   per thousand yen1000 g, respectively, were enrolled and analysed.
   Comparing the baseline period to the last 6 months period, the NMR was
   lower in the intervention versus control clusters (OR 0.60, 95 \% CI
   0.34-1.06, p = 0.076) as was the PMR (OR 0.74, 95 \% CI 0.46-1.19, p =
   0.20) although neither reached statistical significance. Rates of
   facility birth and caesarean section increased among both groups. There
   was limited influence on quality of care measures.
   The intervention had large but not statistically significant effects on
   neonatal and perinatal mortality. Community mobilization and increased
   facility care may ultimately improve neonatal and perinatal survival,
   and are important in the context of the global transition towards

Abstract = {{Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a common approach for
   systematic discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which are
   associated with a given disease. Univariate analysis approaches commonly
   employed may miss important SNP associations that only appear through
   multivariate analysis in complex diseases. However, multivariate SNP
   analysis is currently limited by its inherent computational complexity.
   In this work, we present a computational framework that harnesses
   supercomputers. Based on our results, we estimate a three-way
   interaction analysis on 1.1 million SNP GWAS data requiring over 5.8
   years on the full ``Avoca{''} IBM Blue Gene/Q installation at the
   Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative. This is hundreds of
   times faster than estimates for other CPU based methods and four times
   faster than runtimes estimated for GPU methods, indicating how the
   improvement in the level of hardware applied to interaction analysis may
   alter the types of analysis that can be performed. Furthermore, the same
   analysis would take under 3 months on the currently largest IBM Blue
   Gene/Q supercomputer ``Sequoia{''} at the Lawrence Livermore National
   Laboratory assuming linear scaling is maintained as our results suggest.
   Given that the implementation used in this study can be further
   optimised, this runtime means it is becoming feasible to carry out
   exhaustive analysis of higher order interaction studies on large modern
   GWAS.}},

Abstract = {{Near-infrared wavefront sensing allows for the enhancement of sky
   coverage with adaptive optics. The recently developed HgCdTe avalanche
   photodiode arrays are promising due to their very low detector noise,
   but still present an imperfect cosmetic that may directly impact
   real-time wavefront measurements for adaptive optics and thus degrade
   performance in astronomical applications. We propose here a model of a
   Shack-Hartmann wavefront measurement in the presence of residual fixed
   pattern noise and defective pixels. To adjust our models, a fine
   characterization of such an HgCdTe array, the RAPID sensor, is proposed.
   The impact of the cosmetic defects on the Shack -Hartmann measurement is
   assessed through numerical simulations. This study provides both a new
   insight on the applicability of cadmium mercury telluride (CMT)
   avalanche photodiodes detectors for astronomical applications and
   criteria to specify the cosmetic qualities of future arrays. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Clinical outcomes of IVF cycles using propofol or thiopental sodium as
   anaesthetic agents for oocyte retrieval were compared. The primary
   outcome measure was fertilization rate per patient. One hundred and
   eighty patients undergoing ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins and
   gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists for IVF were randomized to
   receive either propofol (n = 90) or thiopental sodium (n = 90). No
   significant differences in baseline characteristics were present between
   the two groups. Overall fertilization rates were similar between
   propofol and thiopental sodium groups, respectively: median (IQR): 54.8
   (29.2) versus 54.6 (29.7); fertilization rates for intracytoplasmic
   sperm injection only: median (IQR): 70 (50) versus 75 (50),
   respectively. For secondary outcome measures, time under anaesthesia was
   significantly increased in the thiopental sodium group: median (IQR):
   12(5) versus 10 (4.5) min, P = 0.019 compared with the propofol group.
   Number of cumulus oocyte complexes retrieved {[} median (IQR): 7.1 (6.3)
   versus 6.5 (5.6)] did not differ significantly between the two groups. A
   non-significant difference in live birth rates per randomized patient of
   +4.4\% (95\% CI: -5.7 to + 14.6) in favour of propofol was observed. Use
   of propofol compared with thiopental sodium for general anaesthesia
   during oocyte retrieval results in similar fertilization rates and IVF
   outcomes. (C) 2015 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Very few studies have been dedicated to R-hydroxyacids (R-HA) production
   using extracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate depolymerases (ePhaZs).
   Penicillium expansum produced maximum extracellular polyhydroxybutyrate
   depolymerase (similar to 6 U/mL) by 72 h when grown in mineral salt
   medium containing 0.2 \% w/v PHB, pH 5.0, at 30 degrees C and 200 rpm
   shaking conditions. Partial purification of the extracellular
   poly(-beta-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase PHAZ(Pen) from P. expansum by
   two steps using ammonium sulphate (80 \% saturation) and affinity
   chromatography using concanavalin A yielded 22.76-fold purity and 43.15
   \% recovery of protein. The enzyme composed of a single polypeptide
   chain of apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE,
   stained positive for glycoprotein by periodic-schiff base (PAS)
   staining. Optimum enzyme activity was detected between pH 4.0 and 6.0 at
   45-50 degrees C with pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C supporting maximum
   activity. The enzyme was stable between pH 4.0 and 6.0 at 55 degrees C
   for 1 h with a residual activity of almost 70-80 \%. The enzyme was
   completely inhibited by 1 mM DTT/1 mM HgCl2 and N-ethylmaleimide (10 mM)
   indicating the importance of essential disulphide bonds (cystine
   residues) and tyrosine for enzyme activity or probably for maintaining
   the native enzyme structure. Among the various divalent and trivalent
   metal ions, mercuric chloride, ferric citrate and ferrous sulphate
   inhibited enzyme activity. The enzyme showed substrate specificity
   towards only PHB and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) and no
   other lipid or other p-nitrophenyl fatty acids or with polycaprolactone,
   showing that it was a true depolymerase and not any lipase or cutinase.
   Preliminary investigation revealed beta-hydroxybutyrate as the end
   product of PHB hydrolysis by P. expansum, suggesting that the enzyme
   acted principally as an exo-type hydrolase. The above properties when
   compared with other fungal PHB depolymerases reported till date suggest
   the distinct nature of the PHB depolymerase of P. expansum.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{637-649}},

Abstract = {{Environmental awareness and ever-growing restrictive regulations over
   contamination have increased the need for more environmentally-friendly
   lubricants. Due to their superior biodegradability and lower toxicity,
   vegetable oils are a good alternative to replace currently-used mineral
   oils. However, vegetable oils show low oxidation and thermal stability
   and poor anti-wear properties. Most of these drawbacks can be attenuated
   through the use of additives. In the last decade, ionic liquids have
   emerged as high-performance fluids and lubricant additives due to their
   unique characteristics. In this study, the tribological behavior of two
   phosphonium-based ionic liquids is investigated as additives of coffee
   bean oil in steel-steel contact. Coffee bean oil-ionic liquid blends
   containing 1, 2.5, and 5 wt\% of each ionic liquid are studied using a
   block-on-flat reciprocating tribometer and the test results are compared
   to commercially-available, fully-formulated lubricant. Results showed
   that the addition of the ionic liquids to the coffee bean oil reduces
   wear volume of the steel disks, and wear values achieved are comparable
   to that obtained when the commercially-available lubricant is used.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The complex nature of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is often
   simplified through the use of conceptual models, each of which offers a
   different perspective on the ocean-atmosphere feedbacks underpinning the
   ENSO cycle. One theory, the unified oscillator, combines a variety of
   conceptual frameworks in the form of a coupled system of delay
   differential equations. The system produces a self-sustained oscillation
   on interannual time scales. While the unified oscillator is assumed to
   provide a more complete conceptual framework of ENSO behaviors than the
   models it incorporates, its formulation and performance have not been
   systematically assessed. This paper investigates the accuracy of the
   unified oscillator through its ability to replicate the ENSO cycle
   modeled by flux-forced output from the Australian Community Climate and
   Earth-System Simulator Ocean Model (ACCESS-OM). The anomalous sea
   surface temperature equation reproduces the main features of the
   corresponding tendency modeled by ACCESS-OM reasonably well. However,
   the remaining equations for the thermocline depth anomaly and zonal wind
   stress anomalies are unable to accurately replicate the corresponding
   tendencies in ACCESS-OM. Modifications to the unified oscillator,
   including a diagnostic form of the zonal wind stress anomaly equations,
   improve its ability to emulate simulated ENSO tendencies. Despite these
   improvements, the unified oscillator model is less adept than the
   delayed oscillator model it incorporates in capturing ENSO behavior in
   ACCESS-OM, bringing into question its usefulness as a unifying ENSO
   framework.}},

   modelling}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{192}},
Pages = {{65-73}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Incidence Function Model (IFM) has been put forward as a tool for
   assessing conservation plans. A key benefit of the IFM is low data
   requirements: widely available species occurrence data and information
   about land cover. Citizen science is a promising source of such data;
   however, to use these data in the IFM there are typically two problems.
   First, the spatial resolution is too coarse, but existing approaches to
   downscaling species data tend not to extend to patch level (as required
   by the IFM). Second, widely available citizen science data typically
   report species' presences only. We devise ten different downscaling
   methods based on theoretical ecological relationships (the species-area
   relationship and the distance decay of similarity), and test them
   against each other. The better performing downscaling methods were based
   on patch area, rather than distance from other occupied patches. These
   methods allow data at a coarse resolution to be used in the IFM for
   comparing conservation management and development plans. Further field
   testing is required to establish the degree to which results of these
   new methods can be treated as definitive spatially-explicit predictions.
   To address the issue of false absences, we present a method to estimate
   the probability that all species have been listed (and thus that a
   species' absence from the list represents a true absence), using the
   species-accumulation curve. This measure of confidence in absence helps
   both to objectively identify a habitat network for fitting the IFM, and
   to target areas for further species recording. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Extensive reading has been used as an approach to L2 instruction in
   foreign language contexts, where there is a need to provide rich and
   extensive input to learners. Previous research has shown that this type
   of instructional intervention is associated with improved performance in
   L2 reading comprehension and writing, as well as with increased positive
   attitudes toward L2 reading. However, not enough research has
   investigated the factors that mediate its effectiveness with young L2
   learners. This study investigated the role of L1 reading-related factors
   in L2 learning under extensive reading-while-listening instruction. The
   findings of the study indicated a relationship between L2 learning gains
   in writing and positive L1 reading attitudes, a supportive reading
   environment at home, mother's reading interest, and parents' education
   level. The study concluded that extensive L2 reading-while-listening
   instruction allows some learners to gain additional benefits, but
   without disadvantaging the others. This has implications for teaching
   programs in the primary school context investigated, which should take
   learner background profiles into account when implementing this type of
   L2 instruction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis and classification of CKD are based on laboratory tests.
   Aim of this paper is to examine different aspects of the laboratory
   contribution to verify their harmonization at national level. We review
   relationships between laboratory and clinical organizations, the role of
   2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, the
   quality of creatinine and urine albumin measurements, the status of
   estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, the use of
   cystatin C and testing plans. Questionnaires examining different aspects
   of the CKD diagnostics were sent out and EQAS for creatinine and urine
   albumin measurements were carried out. For creatinine measurement,
   enzymatic assays show the best performance, while for urine albumin a
   bias still exists between different methods. The eGFR is routinely
   reported by 75\% of surveyed laboratories, but only 15\% of them use the
   equation derived by the CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) study.
   For urine albumin, the recommended first morning void sample is used by
   similar to 60\% of laboratories, but the wrong terminology of
   ``microalbuminuria{''} is still used by > 40\% of them. Cystatin C is
   offered by a minority of laboratories. In conclusion, even if an
   improvement can be observed during the recent years, efforts for a
   better alignment to international recommendations are needed. Often they
   just require cultural and organizational changes, without the
   availability of additional economic resources.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The current study examines the predictive validity of the
   Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) suicide item for death by suicide and
   suicide attempts.
   Method: The study included 2 samples: (1) 5,200 psychiatric outpatients
   who were evaluated between 1975 and 1995 and followed prospectively for
   up to 20 years (all psychiatric diagnoses based on DSM-III and
   DSM-III-R), and (2) 119 patients who, between 2000 and 2004,
   participated in a randomized controlled trial of outpatient Cognitive
   Therapy for Suicide Prevention after a suicide attempt and were followed
   for 18 months (all psychiatric diagnoses based on DSM-IV-TR). All
   patients completed structured diagnostic interviews, as well as the BDI
   and Scale for Suicide Ideation.
   Results: Cox regression models demonstrated that the BDI suicide item
   significantly predicted both deaths by suicide (Wald X-1(2) = 35.67; P
   <.001 {[}N = 5,200]) and repeat suicide attempts (Wald X-1(2) = 8.82; P
   <.01 {[}N = 119]), with each successive rating on the item conferring
   greater risk. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves,
   optimal cutoff scores of 1 and above for suicide and 2 and above for
   suicide attempts were identified as providing the best balance between
   sensitivity and specificity.
   Conclusions: The BDI suicide item is associated with both risk of repeat
   suicide attempts and death by suicide. The use of the item as a brief,
   efficient screen for suicide risk in routine clinical care is
   recommended. Clinicians would then conduct a comprehensive suicide risk
   assessment in response to a positive screen. Future research examining
   the item's performance in other at-risk groups (ie, older adults,
   adolescents, inpatients, etc) is encouraged. (C) Copyright 2015

   bevacizumab-based chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The presence of
   and changes in renal cysts were evaluated by retrospective analysis of
   computed tomography scans performed for assessment of tumor response to
   bevacizumab-based therapy.
   Results: The median age of the patients was 64 years. Renal cysts were
   identified in 66 patients, in whom 33 (50\%) had a single cyst and the
   rest had 2 or more cysts. The average dose of bevacizumab was 2.68 mg/kg
   per week. Median duration of treatment was 33 weeks. Average cyst size
   was 1.9 +/- 2.4 cm at the beginning of the study and the majority of the
   cysts (54 patients, 84\%) did not change in size or shape during
   bevacizumab treatment. No patients were identified with new cysts. Cyst
   size changed in 10 patients (16\%): an increase of 15\% to 40\% from the
   baseline size in 5 patients and a decrease in size of 10\% to 70\% in
   another 5 patients. The duration of bevacizumab therapy was
   significantly longer in the subgroup of patients with diminished or
   increased cyst size than in the patients with stable cyst size: 62 weeks
   versus 29 weeks, respectively (p=0.0002).
   Conclusions: Our data demonstrated that simple renal cysts were stable
   in size and number in the vast majority of cancer patients treated with
   bevacizumab.}},

Abstract = {{A broadband dielectric investigation and Mossbauer studies were
   performed on 0.7BaTiO(3)-0.3NiFe(2)O(4) composite ceramics prepared from
   chemically obtained barium titanate and nickel ferrite powders.
   Dielectric spectroscopy revealed a Debye-type relaxation at frequencies
   between 10 GHz and 1 THz. The relaxation time slows down on cooling
   according to the Arrhenius law which can be attributed to the
   transformation of the system from the paraelectric to the ferroelectric
   phase through an intermediate relaxor state. The temperature dependence
   of the center shift of the Mossbauer spectrum was analyzed by applying
   Debye and Einstein models. Its deviation from these models can be
   attributed to the anharmonicity. It is also possible that the center
   shift is affected by the Fe atoms incorporated in BaTiO3 lattice or at
   the interfaces between BaTiO3 and NiFe2O4.}},

Abstract = {{Financial literacy predicts informed financial decisions, but what
   explains financial literacy? We use the concept of financial
   socialization and aim to represent three major agents of financial
   socialization: family, school and work. Thus we compile twelve relevant
   childhood characteristics in a new survey study and examine their
   relation to financial literacy, while controlling for established
   socio-demographic characteristics. We find in a mediation analysis that
   both family and school positively affect the financial literacy of
   adults. Moreover, financial literacy and school related variables also
   have a direct effect on financial behavior. This suggests that family
   factors and schooling work through complementary channels. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Active-learning environments such as those found in a flipped classroom
   are known to increase student performance, although how these gains are
   realized over the course of a semester is less well understood. In an
   upper-level lecture course designed primarily for biochemistry majors,
   we examine how students attain improved learning outcomes, as measured
   by exam scores, when the course is converted to a more active flipped
   format. The context is a physical chemistry course catering to life
   science majors in which approximately half of the lecture material is
   placed online and in-class problem-solving activities are increased,
   while total class time is reduced. We find that exam performance
   significantly improves by nearly 12\% in the flipped-format course, due
   in part to students interacting with course material in a more timely
   and accurate manner. We also find that the positive effects of the
   flipped class are most pronounced for students with lower grade point
   averages and for female students.}},

Abstract = {{Great Expectations (1860-61) offers a lesson in what it meant to live
   through the nineteenth century's global revolution in transportation.
   The narrating protagonist Pip, looking back from 1860, structures his
   story partly around his recognition that he was born into an
   increasingly connected global network. From a first-person perspective,
   unknown activity at a distance-such as that of the convict Magwitch in
   Australia-turns out to be synchronically consequential. Rather than
   discovering, however, the fragmentation of an unknowable world, the
   narrator learns from the collocation and interchangeability of the
   transport system's passengers. These help to contribute to the
   development of Pip's limited third-person view of himself, from which
   the narrator relays his story as a networked subject.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To conduct a survey of radiation oncologists in India, to
   better understand specific educational needs of radiation oncology in
   India and define areas of collaboration with US institutions.
   Methods and Materials: A 20-question survey was distributed to members
   of the Association of Indian Radiation Oncologists and the Indian
   Brachytherapy Society between November 2013 and May 2014.
   Results: We received a total of 132 responses. Over 50\% of the
   physicians treat more than 200 patients per day, use 2-dimensional or
   3-dimensional treatment planning techniques, and approximately 50\% use
   image guided techniques. For education needs, most respondents agreed
   that further education in intensity modulated radiation therapy, image
   guided radiation therapy, stereotactic radiation therapy, biostatistics,
   and research methods for medical residents would be useful areas of
   collaboration with institutions in the United States. Other areas of
   collaboration include developing a structured training module for
   nursing, physics training, and developing a second-opinion clinic for
   difficult cases with faculty in the United States.
   Conclusion: Various areas of potential collaboration in radiation
   oncology education were identified through this survey. These include
   the following: establishing education programs focused on current
   technology, facilitating exchange programs for trainees in India to the
   United States, promoting training in research methods, establishing
   training modules for physicists and oncology nurses, and creating an
   Indo-US. Tumor Board. It would require collaboration between the
   Association of Indian Radiation Oncologists and the American Society for
   Radiation Oncology to develop these educational initiatives. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Mountain waves and rotors in the lee of the Medicine Bow Mountains in
   southeastern Wyoming are investigated in a two-part paper. Part I by
   French et al. delivers a detailed observational account of two rotor
   events: one displays characteristics of a hydraulic jump and the other
   displays characteristics of a classic lee-wave rotor. In Part II,
   presented here, results of high-resolution numerical simulations are
   conveyed and physical processes involved in the formation and dynamical
   evolution of these two rotor events are examined.The simulation results
   reveal that the origin of the observed rotors lies in boundary layer
   separation, induced by wave perturbations whose amplitudes reach maxima
   at or near the mountain top. An undular hydraulic jump that gave rise to
   a rotor in one of these events was found to be triggered by
   midtropospheric wave breaking and an ensuing strong downslope windstorm.
   Lee waves spawning rotors developed under conditions favoring wave
   energy trapping at low levels in different phases of these two events.
   The upstream shift of the boundary layer separation zone, documented to
   occur over a relatively short period of time in both events, is shown to
   be the manifestation of a transition in flow regimes, from downslope
   windstorms to trapped lee waves, in response to a rapid change in the
   upstream environment, related to the passage of a short-wave synoptic
   disturbance aloft.The model results also suggest that the secondary
   obstacles surrounding the Medicine Bow Mountains play a role in the
   dynamics of wave and rotor events by promoting lee-wave resonance in the
   complex terrain of southeastern Wyoming.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-to-cell heterogeneity typically evolves due to a manifold of
   biological and environmental factors and special phenotypes are often
   relevant for the fate of the whole population but challenging to detect
   during conventional analysis. We demonstrate a microfluidic single-cell
   cultivation platform that incorporates several hundred growth chambers,
   in which isogenic bacteria microcolonies growing in cell monolayers are
   tracked by automated time-lapse microscopy with spatiotemporal
   resolution. The device was not explicitly developed for a specific
   organism, but has a very generic configuration suitable for various
   different microbial organisms. In the present study, we analyzed
   Corynebacterium glutamicum microcolonies, thereby generating complete
   lineage trees and detailed single-cell data on division behavior and
   morphology in order to demonstrate the platform's overall capabilities.
   Furthermore, the occurrence of spontaneously induced stress in
   individual C. glutamicum cells was investigated by analyzing strains
   with genetically encoded reporter systems and optically visualizing SOS
   response. The experiments revealed spontaneous SOS induction in the
   absence of any external trigger comparable to results obtained by flow
   cytometry (FC) analyzing cell samples from conventional shake flask
   cultivation. Our microfluidic setup delivers detailed single-cell data
   with spatial and temporal resolution; complementary information to
   conventional FC results. (C) 2015 International Society for Advancement

Abstract = {{Penicillin G acylases (PGAs) are enantioselective enzymes catalyzing a
   hydrolysis of stable amide bond in a broad spectrum of substrates. Among
   them, derivatives of alpha- and beta-amino acids represent a class of
   compounds with high application potential. PGA(Ec) from Escherichia coil
   and PGA(A) from Achromobacter sp. CCM 4824 were used to catalyze
   enantioselective hydrolyses of seven selected N-phenylacetylated
   alpha/beta-amino acid racemates. The PGA(A) showed higher
   stereoselectivity for enantiomers of N-PhA-beta-homoleucine,
   N-PhAc-alpha-tert-leucine and N-PhAc-beta-leucine. To study the
   mechanism of enantiodiscrimination on molecular level, we have
   constructed a homology model of PGA(A) that was used in molecular
   docking experiments with the same substrates. In-silico experiments
   successfully reproduced the data from experimental enzymatic resolutions
   confirming validity of employed modeling protocol. We employed this
   protocol to evaluate enantiopreference of PGA(A) towards seven new
   substrates with application potential. For five of them, high
   enantioselectivity of PGA(A) was predicted. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper authors perform a research on possibilities of RDF
   (Resource Description Framework) syntaxes usage for information
   representation in Semantic Web. It is described why pure XML cannot be
   effectively used for this purpose, and how RDF framework solves this
   problem. Information is being represented in a form of a directed graph.
   RDF is only an abstract formal model for information representation and
   side tools are required in order to write down that information. Such
   tools are RDF syntaxes - concrete text or binary formats, which
   prescribe rules for RDF data serialization. Text-based RDF syntaxes can
   be developed on the existing format basis (XML, JSON) or can be an
   RDF-specific - designed from scratch to serve the only purpose - to
   serialize RDF graphs. Authors briefly describe some of the RDF syntaxes
   (both XML and non-XML) and compare them in order to identify strengths
   and weaknesses of each version. Serialization and deserialization speed
   tests using Jena library are made. The results from both analytical and
   experimental parts of this research are used to develop the
   recommendations for RDF syntaxes usage and to design a RDF/XML syntax
   subset, which is intended to simplify the development and raise
   compatibility of information serialized with this RDF syntax.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to examine the efficiency of the thermal wave

   carbon and methanol. Adsorption units can work in trigeneration systems
   and in applications driven by waste heat. They can be built also as a
   part of hybrid sorption-compressor systems, and they are very popular in
   solar refrigeration systems and energy storage units. The device
   examined in this study operates in a special mode called thermal wave.
   This mode allows to achieve higher efficiency rates than the normal mode
   of operation, as a significant contributor to transport heat from one to
   the other adsorber. To carry out the experiment a test bench was built,
   consisting of two cylindrical adsorbers filled with activated carbon,
   condenser, evaporator, oil heater and two oil coolers. Thermal oil
   circulation was responsible for providing and receiving heat from
   adsorbers. In order to perform the correct action a special control
   algorithm device was developed and implemented to keep the temperature
   in the evaporator at a preset level. The experimental results show the
   operating parameters changes in both adsorbers. Obtained COP
   (coefficient of performance) for the cycle was 0.13.}},

Abstract = {{We used advanced radar interferometry time-series analysis methods,
   persistent scatterer interferometry and small baseline subset, to
   delineate areas of ground deformation related to underground coal mining
   in Springfield, Illinois, USA, and to measure the temporal pattern of
   deformation. Two satellite radar systems were used: the European Remote
   Sensing satellites (ERS-1/2) covered a period from June 14, 1992 to
   August 30, 2000 and the Phased Array type L-band synthetic aperture
   radar (PALSAR) onboard the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)
   covered from June 18, 2007 to February 11, 2011. Results from ERS-1/2
   processing showed several areas in Springfield subsiding. ALOS PALSAR,
   however, appears to overestimate deformation, probably because of large
   baselines and the limited number of images. Many of these areas are
   likely the result of collapse of underground mine workings and are
   consistent with reported incidents of past mine subsidence. The maximum
   deformation rate attributed to mine subsidence for the period from 1992
   to 2000 was up to about -4.1 mm/year, while for the period from 2007 to
   2011 the rate was up to about -35.9 mm/year. In addition, we discovered
   a railroad right-of-way south of Springfield that had subsided at a rate
   of about 3 mm/year during the 1992-2000 period. The measurements of both
   ERS-1/2 and ALOS PALSAR are consistent with on-the-ground survey data
   taken from November 29, 1989 to April 23, 2008. Our study has revealed
   several locations of subsidence likely caused by the collapse of
   abandoned underground mine workings. Also, the unexpected discovery of
   ground surface displacement of the railroad right-of-way reveals one of
   the advantages of satellite-based monitoring, namely discovering unknown
   deformation areas.}},

Title = {{Sorafenib Enriches Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-Positive Tumor
   Initiating Cells and Exacerbates a Subtype of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
   Through TSC2-AKT Cascade}},
Journal = {{HEPATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sorafenib is a specific adenosine triphosphate-competitive RAF inhibitor
   used as a first-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC). However, the responses are variable, reflecting heterogeneity of
   the disease, while the resistance mechanism remains poorly understood.
   Here, we report that sorafenib treatment can exacerbate disease
   progression in both patient-derived xenografts and cell line-derived
   xenografts and that the therapeutic effect of the drug inversely
   covaries to the ratio of epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive
   cells, which may be tumor initiating cells in HCC. The TSC2-AKT cascade
   mediates this sorafenib resistance. In response to sorafenib treatment,
   formation of the TSC1/2 complex is enhanced, causing increased
   phosphorylation of AKT, which contributes to up-regulation of
   ``stemness{''}-related genes in epithelial cell adhesion
   molecule-positive cells and enhancement of tumorigenicity. The
   expression of TSC2 negatively correlated with prognosis in clinical
   sorafenib therapy. Furthermore, all-trans retinoic acid decreased AKT
   activity, reduced the epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive cell
   population enriched by sorafenib, and potentiated the therapeutic effect
   of sorafenib in the patient-derived xenograft model. Conclusion: Our
   findings suggest that a subtype of HCC is not suitable for sorafenib

Abstract = {{Greenhouse gas emissions and associated global climate change are a
   significant and growing concern for the world community. In order to
   improve building energy efficiency, the use of evaporative cooling
   systems is attracting growing attention. Using a climate assessment
   tool, the potential use of direct evaporative coolers over different
   Australian climates is evaluated. It is found that overall, the
   potential use of direct evaporative cooling is very significant in
   Australian climates. Among all the eight capital cities across
   Australia, except for Darwin, the need of hybrid cooling for other
   cities is found to be insignificant, and is less than 5\% if appropriate
   air circulation is provided on hot/warm days. It is also found that the
   potential use of evaporative cooling can be significantly influenced by
   a change in the applications or design parameters. In Brisbane, it is
   estimated that with an increase of sensible cooling load from 30 W/m(2)
   to 40 W/m(2) in the conditioned space, the requirement in hours of
   hybrid cooling can increase significantly, from 4.06\% to 14.89\%. Crown

Abstract = {{Biomass-fuelled polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) offer a
   solution for replacing fossil fuel with hydrogen production. This paper
   uses simulation methods for investigating biomass-fuelled PEMFCs for
   different raw materials and conversion paths. For liquid and solid
   biomass, anaerobic digestion (AD) and gasification (GF), respectively,
   are relatively viable and developed conversion technologies. Therefore,
   the AD-PEMFC system and the GF-PEMFC system are simulated for
   residential applications in order to evaluate the performance of the
   biomass-fuelled PEMFC systems. The results of the evaluation show that
   renewable hydrogen-rich gas from manure or forest residues is usable for
   the PEMFCs and makes the fuel cell stack work in a stable manner. For
   100 kWe generation, the GF-PEMFC system yields an excellent technical
   performance with a 20\% electric efficiency and 57\% thermal efficiency,
   whereas the AD-PEMFC system only has an 9\% electric efficiency and 13\%
   thermal efficiency due to the low efficiency of the anaerobic digester
   (AD) and the high internal heat consumption of the AD and the steam
   reformer (SR). Additionally, in this study, the environmental
   performances of the AD-PEMFC and the GF-PEMFC in terms of CO2 emission
   offset and land-use efficiency are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A popular way to improve consumers' control over their electricity
   consumption is by providing outcome feedback on the cost with in-home
   displays. Research on function learning, however, suggests that outcome
   feedback may not always be ideal for learning, especially if the
   feedback signal is noisy. In this study, we relate research on function
   learning to in-home displays and use a laboratory task simulating a
   household to investigate the role of outcome feedback and function
   learning on electricity optimization. Three function training schemes
   (FTSs) are presented that convey specific properties of the functions
   that relate the electricity consumption to the utility and cost. In
   Experiment 1, we compared learning from outcome feedback with 3 FTSs, 1
   of which allowed maximization of the utility while keeping the budget,
   despite no feedback about the total monthly cost. In Experiment 2, we
   explored the combination of this FTS and outcome feedback. The results
   suggested that electricity optimization may be facilitated if feedback
   learning is preceded by a brief period of function training.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Recognizing acquired demyelinating syndromes and multiple
   sclerosis is important to commence early treatment. The objective of
   this study was to describe the incidence of acquired demyelinating
   syndromes and multiple sclerosis among the entire Icelandic pediatric
   population according to recently promoted criteria. PATIENTS AND
   METHODS: The study included all children in Iceland (<18 years) with
   acquired demyelinating syndromes and multiple sclerosis from 1990 to
   2009 with a minimum of 5-year follow-up. Clinical data were gathered and
   radiological images reviewed. The cohort included all patients with
   acquired demyelinating syndromes and multiple sclerosis in the Icelandic
   pediatric population. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with acquired
   demyelinating syndromes and multiple sclerosis were included, the total
   annual incidence being 1.15/100,000 (acquired demyelinating syndromes
   1.02 and multiple sclerosis 0.45/100,000). The median age at diagnosis
   was 14.25 years (range 1.25-17.5 years). Thirteen patients were
   initially diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome, two had acute
   disseminated encephalomyelitis, two had multiple sclerosis, and one had
   neuromyelitis optica. Seven children were diagnosed with multiple
   sclerosis; three patients with clinically isolated syndrome developed
   multiple sclerosis after the age of 18 and were not included in the
   multiple sclerosis group. The gender ratio was equal. Of the nine girls,
   seven were diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome. Most patients
   (11 of 18) were diagnosed during the period January through March.
   Oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid were exclusively found in
   patients with multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome and 13
   of 14 available magnetic resonance images revealed clear abnormalities.
   CONCLUSION: The annual incidence of acquired demyelinating syndromes and
   multiple sclerosis in Iceland was 1.15/100,000 children. The risk of
   progression from clinically isolated syndrome to multiple sclerosis was
   high. There was no female preponderance.}},

Abstract = {{In the research work described here, single-crystalline SrTiO3 has been
   used as a model system to facilitate the development of a new
   qualitative characterization method for the nondestructive
   identification of small-angle boundaries in bulk single crystals.
   Subgrain misorientations with a lower limit in the range between 40 and
   100 `' were reliably identified. For scientists and engineers working in
   the field of single-crystal growth it is often indispensable to
   continuously check the structural quality of the grown bulk crystals,
   which is usually time consuming or challenging for large single
   crystals. This article presents in detail how a spatially resolved micro
   X-ray fluorescent device can be used for the identification of subgrains
   and merely a one-side-planarized sample of nearly arbitrary geometry is
   needed. The approach presented combines high-speed measurements and full
   sample area coverage with a high spatial resolution of 25 mm. The
   resolution is limited by the spot size of the focused X-ray beam. The
   Bremsstrahlung of the excitation source interacts with the crystals, and
   because of the instrument geometry it is possible to detect Bragg
   reflections. These reflections can be found at specific energies and can
   be displayed in two-dimensional diffraction intensity maps. These maps
   were used for the qualitative analysis of the crystal domains. The
   results obtained by this new approach were verified by rocking curve
   measurements and by defect-selective etching studies. Ultrafast
   large-area mappings on widely used polysilicon were additionally
   performed to demonstrate the potential of the developed method for use
   in industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Antimicrobial resistance results from a complex interaction
   between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, antimicrobial pressure,
   and genes, which together comprise the total body of potential
   resistance elements. The purpose of this study is to review and evaluate
   the importance of antimicrobial pressure on the development of
   resistance in a single surgical intensive care unit. Methods: We
   reviewed a prospectively collected dataset of all intensive care unit
   (ICU)-acquired infections in surgical and trauma patients over a 6-y
   period at a single hospital. Resistant gram-negative pathogens (rGNR)
   included those resistant to all aminoglycosides, quinolones,
   penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems; resistant gram-positive
   infections (rGPC) included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Each resistant
   infection was evaluated for prior or concomitant antibiotic use,
   previous treatment for the same (non-resistant) organism, and concurrent
   infection with the same organism (genus and species, although not
   necessarily resistant) in another ICU patient. Results: Three hundred
   and thirty resistant infections were identified: 237rGNR and 93rGPC.
   Infections with rGNR occurred frequently while receiving antibiotic
   therapy (65\%), including the sensitive form of the subsequent resistant
   pathogen (42.2\%). Infections with rGPC were also likely to occur on
   antimicrobial therapy (50.6\%). Treatment of a different patient for an
   infection with the same resistant pathogen in the ICU at the time of
   diagnosis, implying potential patient-to-patient transmission occurred
   more frequently with rGNR infections (38.8\%). Conclusion: Antimicrobial
   pressure exerts a substantial effect on the development of subsequent
   infection. Our data demonstrate a high estimated rate of de novo
   emergence of resistance after treatment, which appears to be more common
   than patient-to-patient transmission. These data support the concept
   that efforts to limit antimicrobial usage will be more efficacious than
   enhanced isolation procedures when trying to reduce antimicrobial
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was conducted to investigate the physico-chemical
   characteristics in drinking water of Mardan District, Pakistan.
   Furthermore, water quality was evaluated for the risk assessment of
   arsenic and heavy metals (HMs) and their contamination sources.
   Representative groundwater samples of shallow and deep sources were
   collected in the study area. These samples were analyzed for physical
   parameters, anions, light metals (LMs) and HMs. Results were compared
   with the drinking water guideline values set by the World Health
   Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency. Average
   concentrations of anions, LMs and HMs were found within the maximum
   allowable contaminant levels except for bicarbonates, Fe, Cu, and Pb.
   Results revealed that hazard quotients > 1 were observed for shallow
   groundwater for 10\% samples only, suggesting potential health risk from
   water consumption. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis

Abstract = {{Although many advances in renal transplantation have occurred over
   recent decades, bladder catheterization has remained a constant practice
   to facilitate the identification of the dome of the bladder by
   retrograde infusion of antibiotic solutions in its lumen prior to the
   creation of the cystoureteric anastomosis. In addition, the presence of
   the Foley catheter prevents possible tension on the newly created
   anastomosis between the ureter and the bladder as it allows continuous
   external drainage of urine and is very useful to monitor perioperative
   fluid balance. Although urethral catheterization provides several
   benefits, the optimal duration of catheterization remains a subject of
   controversy. The primary aim of this paper is to review the available
   scientific literature on the management of urethral catheters after
   renal transplantation and assess the pros and cons of early vs late
   catheter removal.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this work were to evaluate the effect of in vitro
   gastrointestinal digestion (GID) on (i) the recovery and
   bioaccessibility indexes, (ii) the changes on antioxidant activity and
   (iii) the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production of two DF rich
   extracts (date pits flour (DPF) and apple bagasse flour (ABF)) obtained
   from agroindustrial co-products. At the end of GID process, the
   bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds present in DPF and ABF was 78.54
   and 91.58\%, respectively. With regard to antioxidant activity, GID
   increased the chelating activity and reducing power. However, the
   scavenging properties were reduced. Fermentation of DPF and ABF by
   colonic bacteria generated SCFA such as formiate, succinate, acetate,
   propionate and butyrate. These findings suggest that DPF and ABF might
   be used as potential food ingredients due to GID produced that bioactive
   compounds released from the matrix which exerts antioxidant activity.

Title = {{Multi-objective optimization to identify key players in large social
   networks}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Identification of a set of key players in a given social network is of
   interest in many disciplines such as sociology, politics, finance,
   economics, etc. Although many algorithms have been proposed to identify
   a set of key players, each emphasizes a single objective of their
   interest. Consequently, the prevailing deficiency of each of these
   methods is that they perform well only when we consider their objective
   of interest as the only characteristic the set of key players should
   have. But in complicated real life applications, we need a set of key
   players which can perform well with respect to multiple objectives of
   interest. In this paper, we propose a new perspective for key player
   identification, based on optimizing multiple objectives of interest.
   This method allows us to compare other methods of key player
   identification. The sets of key players identified by this method are
   better when multiple objectives must be addressed. In addition we
   propose an algorithm to select the most suitable sets of key players
   when multiple choices are available. To reduce the computational
   complexity of the proposed approach for large networks, we propose a new
   sampling approach based on Degree centrality. We apply these algorithms
   in eventual influence limitation (EIL) problem and immunization problem
   and show that our multi-objective methodology outperforms previous key
   player identification approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The amorphous melt-spun (MS) Ti50Ni25Cu25 alloy is subjected to
   high-pressure torsion (HPT) at temperatures of 20-150 degrees C. The
   bright-field (BF) TEM images of the alloy change as a result of HPT
   processing, the view of the bright-field image depends on the
   temperature of HPT processing. HPT processing leads to a decrease in the
   energy of structural relaxation during heating up to 400 degrees C, in
   comparison with the initial MS ribbons. The temperature of
   crystallization of the MS Ti50Ni25Cu25 alloy decreases after HPT
   processing by 40-20 degrees C (depends on the temperature of HPT
   processing). In the MS Ti50Ni25Cu25 alloy, HPT processing and subsequent
   annealing produces noticeably finer grains than annealing at 450 degrees
   C of the initial MS alloy. Consequently, HPT processing alters the
   crystallization kinetics of the MS Ti50Ni25Cu25 alloy.}},

Abstract = {{In her article ``Human Cloning as the Other in Ishiguro's Never Let Me
   Go{''} Wen Guo analyzes Kazuo Ishiguro's novel with focus on Ishiguro's
   analogy between human cloning and people of marginality in contemporary
   society. Guo discusses the novel's ambience of doubt and suspense and
   elaborates on how the theme of otherness is addressed by Ishiguro's
   mock-realism in a landscape of science fiction. Further, Guo analyses

Abstract = {{Three lab-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs) were continuously operated
   to treat saline wastewater under 0\%, 0.75\% and 1.5\% NaCl stress.
   0.75\% and 1.5\% NaCl reduced the COD and NH4+-N removal at the
   beginning, while the removal efficiencies could be recovered along with
   the operation of MBRs. Also, the polysaccharide in extracellular
   polymeric substances (EPS) and soluble microbial products (SMP) played
   an important role in the membrane fouling. Illumina sequencing of 16S
   rRNA gene showed that the increasing level of salinity reduced the
   diversity of the microbial community, and a higher salinity stimulated
   the growth of Bacteroidetes. At genus level, Flavobacterium,
   Aequorivita, Gelidibacter, Microbacterium, and Algoriphagus increased
   with the increase of salinity, which are shown to be highly salt
   tolerant. The strength of salinity or the duration of salinity could
   stimulate the microorganisms with similar functions, and the changes of
   polysaccharide in EPS and SMP were closely related to the membrane
   fouling rate as well as correlated with some saline-resistance genera.

Abstract = {{Bittergourd (Momordica charantia L.) is an important cucurbitaceous crop
   due to its potential to return profit, nutritional value, and production
   potential. The experiment was carried out with 26 genotypes including
   check (Solan Hara) in randomized complete block design with 3
   replications to study the association among yield and yield components,
   their direct and indirect influence on total marketable fruit yield.
   Correlation of various characters with yield is useful and provides
   criteria for direct selection of component characters. While selection
   for yield, improvement of yield contributing characters, which can be
   better ascertained if the nature and kind of association of such traits
   with yield is available, must be considered. The characters average
   fruit weight (0.726), marketable fruits per vine (0.547) and seeds per
   fruit (0.377) exhibited positive phenotypic association while marketable
   fruits per vine (0.684), seeds per fruit (0.625), average fruit weight
   (0.591) and node at which first female flower appears (0.338) showed
   genotypically positive association with total marketable fruit yield per

   in both the perovskite phase and in grain size. The effect of cadmium
   doping on the structural and dielectric properties has been
   investigated. An increase in the dielectric constant was observed with
   cadmium doping in PNNZT. Complex impedance analysis suggests
   poly-dispersive non-Debye type relaxation to occur in the material. The
   frequency dependence of AC conductivity obeys the universal double power
   law. The value of activation energy depends on increase in frequency as
   well as on cadmium doping. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Abstract = {{We will present the proof of existence of renormalized solutions to a
   nonlinear parabolic problem partial derivative(t)u - diva(., Du) = f
   with right-hand side f and initial data u(0) in L-1. The growth and
   coercivity conditions on the monotone vector field a are prescribed by a
   generalized Ar-function M which is anisotropic and inhomogeneous with
   respect to the space variable. In particular, M does not have to satisfy
   an upper growth bound described by a Delta(2)-condition. Therefore we
   work with generalized Musielak-Orlicz spaces which are not necessarily
   reflexive. Moreover we provide a weak sequential stability result for a
   more general problem: partial derivative(t)beta(., u)-div (a(., Du) +
   F(u)) = f, where beta is a monotone function with respect to the second
   variable and F is locally Lipschitz continuous. Within the proof we use
   truncation methods, Young measure techniques, the integration by parts
   formula and monotonicity arguments which have been adapted to
   nonreflexive Musielak-Orlicz spaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background Following the 1990-1991 Gulf War, Gulf War veterans
   (veterans) reported health symptoms more commonly than non-deployed
   groups. This article examines symptom persistence, incidence and
   prevalence 20 years on.
   Methods In 2000-2003 and 2011-2012, a 63-item symptom checklist was
   administered to 697 veterans and 659 comparison group. Symptomatology
   was compared using log-binomial regression.
   Results Both veterans and comparison group reported significantly
   increased prevalence (3-52\%) over time in more than half the symptoms,
   with a similar overall rate of increase. Half the symptoms had higher
   incidence (risk-ratios ranged 1.43-1.50) and a quarter were more
   persistent (risk-ratios ranged 1.12-1.20) in veterans than the
   comparison group.
   Conclusions Symptomatology increased in both groups over time, but
   persisted to a similar extent and had higher incidence among veterans
   than the comparison group. The gap in symptom prevalence between the two
   groups remained unchanged. These findings suggest enduring health
   consequences of Gulf War service. (C) 2015 Commonwealth of Australia.

Abstract = {{Insufficiency fractures during pregnancy or childbirth are difficult to
   diagnose but holds high morbidity for a vulnerable patient group. In
   documenting the patient's pathway, diagnostic challenges and treatment
   options, it is hoped that pregnancy-related insufficiency fractures will

   Introduction Sacral insufficiency fractures are a poorly understood
   phenomenon, which poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.
   Peripartum females who suffer from transient osteoporosis of pregnancy
   have been shown in several reports to be at particular high risk of
   these fractures.
   Method This case report details such a case and highlights some of the
   challenges that this condition presents. Furthermore, it draws on the
   current literature to offer options for improved techniques for
   diagnosis and up-to-date management for future practice.}},

   J(c) enhancement takes place below 40 K, which is in agreement with the
   expectations for pinning by random point defects. In addition, our data
   show a slight though clear increase in flux creep rates as a function of

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Our aim was to review the processes of glutamate release from both
   biochemical and neurophysiological points of view. A large body of
   evidence now indicates that glutamate is specifically accumulated into
   synaptic vesicles, which provides strong support for the concept that
   glutamate is released from synaptic vesicles and is the major excitatory
   neurotransmitter. Evidence suggests the notion that synaptic vesicles,
   in order to sustain the neurotransmitter pool of glutamate, are endowed
   with an efficient mechanism for vesicular filling of glutamate.
   Glutamate-loaded vesicles undergo removal of Synapsin I by CaM kinase
   II-mediated phosphorylation, transforming to the release-ready pool.
   Vesicle docking to and fusion with the presynaptic plasma membrane are
   thought to be mediated by the SNARE complex. The Ca2+-dependent step in
   exocytosis is proposed to be mediated by synaptotagmin.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the effect of bronchodilation on airway indexes
   reflecting airway disease in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease (COPD) and to determine the minimum number of segmental and
   subsegmental airways required.
   Materials and Methods: This study was approved by the local ethical
   committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
   Twenty patients with COPD who had undergone pre- and postbronchodilator
   pulmonary function tests and computed tomographic (CT) examinations were
   prospectively included. Eight healthy volunteers underwent two CT
   examinations. Luminal area and wall thickness (WT) of third-and
   fourth-generation airways were measured twice by three readers. The
   percentage of total airway area occupied by the wall and the square root
   of wall area at an internal perimeter of 10 mm (root WAPi10) were
   calculated. The effects of pathologic status, session, reader,
   bronchodilation, and CT examination were assessed by using mixed linear
   model analyses. The number of airways to measure for a definite
   percentage error of root WAPi10 was computed by using a bootstrap
   method.
   Results: There were no significant session, reader, or bronchodilation
   effects on WT in third-generation airways and root WAPi10 in patients
   with COPD (P values ranging from .187 to > .999). WT in third-generation
   airways and root WAPi10 were significantly different in patients with
   COPD and control subjects (P = .018 and < .001, respectively). Measuring
   12 third-or fourth-generation airways ensured a maximal 10\% error of
   root WAPi10.
   Conclusion: WT in third-generation airways and root WAPi10 are not
   significantly different before and after bronchodilation and are
   different in patients with COPD and control subjects. Twelve is the
   minimum number of third-or fourth-generation airways required to ensure
   a maximal 10\% error of root WAPi10. (C) RSNA, 2015}},

Title = {{Modeling Driver Compliance to VSL and Quantifying Impacts of Compliance
   Levels and Control Strategy on Mobility and Safety}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Variable speed limits (VSL) aim to improve freeway mobility and safety
   by influencing collective behaviors of drivers. Thus, VSL benefits
   should be positively correlated with the VSL compliance level (CL).
   Surprisingly, a number of heuristic VSL control strategies have shown
   that VSL with increased CLs can, in fact, increase travel time. However,
   it has yet to be analyzed whether or not that outcome is because of the
   control strategy design or the CL. Some recent studies have shown that,
   regardless of CL, a proactive optimal VSL control provides mobility
   benefits; however, no evidence has been found to indicate which CL is
   most achievable in practice, nor has a description been found for the
   distribution of speed of a given VSL. The objective of this paper is to
   quantify the relative contribution of CLs with a proactive optimal VSL
   control toward improving mobility and safety. In this study, several
   CL-to-VSL strategies have been modeled after real-world driver behavior.
   To quantify the impact of CLs only, speed distributions are altered with
   the static speed limit. Then, the benefits are quantified by
   implementing a proactive optimal VSL control strategy with CLs. The
   simulation evaluation shows that both VSL mobility and safety benefits
   are positively correlated with increasing CLs. Specifically, the travel
   time, throughput, and collision probability are improved in the CL
   ranges of 5-15\%, 6-8\%, and 50-60\%, respectively. The study findings
   will help guide transportation agencies in deploying VSL control by
   considering CL, so as to achieve maximum mobility and safety benefits.

Journal = {{URBAN CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{622-635}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Some uncertainty in mobile microclimate observations stems from sensor
   lags. This is especially critical in mobile transect campaigns conducted
   in urban areas, where observations have to be related to the quickly
   varying complex surroundings of the sensor, which becomes difficult if
   the sensor has a high time constant relative to environmental scale and
   sensor velocity. We present an optimized method for sensor lag
   correction using a transfer function, based on the optimization of three
   correction parameters: moving average window size, transfer function
   setup, and linear time shift. We evaluate the method by comparing the
   corrected temperatures measured with ``slow{''} Resistance Temperature
   Detectors (RTD) to a ground truth provided by synchronous measurements
   with thermocouples that have a time constant of less than one second.
   Theoretical assumptions about the correction procedure design are
   substantiated by the optimization procedure, which yields consistent
   results for mobile transect data sets recorded at different times of day
   and in different seasons. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The villous tree of human placentas is a complex
   three-dimensional (3D) structure which enables fetomaternal exchange.
   Current concepts of microscopic analyses are based on the analysis of
   two-dimensional (2D) histologic sections. For this approach, the
   assessment of the stromal core of sectioned villi is of key importance.
   The classification of stromal properties of sectioned villi allows
   allocation of villous sections to villous types which are named by their
   expected position in villous trees (terminal, intermediate, and stem
   villi).
   Method: The present study takes these current concepts of placental
   histology as hypothesis and validates them against predetermined 3D
   positions of branches of villous trees. The 3D positions were determined
   prior to histologic sectioning using a recently introduced
   3D-microscopic approach. Individual histologic sections of villi were
   classified by their stromal structures and inter rater variability of
   these histologic assessments were determined.
   Results/disscussion: Inter rater variability was high and indicates
   substantial observer influence on the outcome of histologic assessments.
   Cross-match of villous types with the predetermined positions of villous
   branches of villous trees revealed substantial mismatch between the
   outcome of stromal classification and 3D-position of the sectioned villi
   in the placental villous trees. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Objective: Dental caries is among the most common chronic diseases in
   humans. Streptococcus mutans is generally responsible for most cases of
   dental caries. The present study sought to compare the effects of
   xylitol-containing and conventional chewing gums on salivary levels of
   S. mutans. Materials and Methods: This study adopted a crossover design.
   Two type of chewing gums (one containing 70\% xylitol and approved by
   the Iranian Dental Association, and another containing sucrose) were
   purchased. The participants were 32 individuals aged 18-35 years whose
   oral hygiene was categorized as moderate or poor based on a caries risk
   assessment table. Salivary levels of S. mutans were measured at
   baseline, after the first and second phases of chewing gums, and after
   the washout period. The measurements were performed on blood agar and
   mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar (MSBA). Pairwise comparisons were then
   used to analyze the collected data. Results: Salivary levels of S.
   mutans in both groups were significantly higher during the two stages of
   chewing gum than in the washout period or baseline. Moreover,
   comparisons between the two types of gums suggested that chewing
   xylitol-containing gums led to greater reductions in S. mutans counts.
   This effect was more apparent in subjects with poor oral hygiene than in
   those with moderate oral hygiene. Conclusions: Xylitol-containing
   chewing gums are more effective than conventional gums in reducing
   salivary levels of S. mutans in individuals with poorumoderate oral
   hygiene.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to investigate on the effectiveness of the
   degree of personality traits through integrating listening task on
   Iranian intermediate EFL learners' improvement of listening
   comprehension ability. The main question this study tried to answer was
   whether the degree of personality traits through integrating listening
   task might enhance higher ability of listening comprehension in Iranian
   learners of English at intermediate level. For this purpose 100 learners
   of English at....... language institute participated in this study.
   Having being homogenized by an Oxford placement test (OPT), 40 learners
   were selected and they were randomly assigned into two groups of
   Extrovert and Introvert. A pretest of listening comprehension was
   administered to both groups, Then the Introvert (experimental) group
   received treatment based on listening task through small talk. While the
   other group received no treatment. At the end both groups sat for
   post-test and received the same listening test in order to explore the
   subjects' ability in two groups on the specific treatment program.
   The data of the study were analyzed using an independent sample t-test
   to indicate the groups' posttest mean difference. The results indicated
   that the Iranian EFL learners in the Introvert (experimental) group
   received higher scores in listening comprehension after being treated
   with listening task through small talk.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Interleukin (IL)-8 plays important roles in the recruitment
   and activation of immune cells during visceral leishmaniasis (VL).
   Genetic variations in IL-8 modulate the expression of IL8 protein and
   may be associated with VL. This study aimed to evaluate polymorphisms at
   the IL8 -251 position in VL patients.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on three groups:
   Leishmania-seropositive patients with clinical symptoms of VL (n=91),
   seropositive patients without clinical symptoms (n=104), and healthy
   controls (n=110). Polymorphisms at the IL-8-251 position were analyzed
   using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Anti-Leishmania
   antibody titers were assessed by immunofluorescence.
   Results: IL-8-251 polymorphism was significantly associated with VL
   (P<0.002). The IL-8-251 T/T genotype was significantly higher in group 1
   than in groups 2 and 3 (P<0.002). The validity of the data was analyzed
   using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and one-way analysis of variance
   (ANOVA), as well as x(2) tests.
   Conclusions: IL-8-251 polymorphism was significantly associated with
   impaired immune responses in VL and might be considered a risk factor
   for disease development.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The widespread use of lead and elevated risk of lead
   exposure in South African children justifies a need for high levels of
   awareness of the sources, exposure pathways, and measures to reduce this
   risk in children. This study aimed to determine the levels of knowledge
   of lead hazards among pregnant women in an area where children had
   already been established to be at a high risk of lead exposure and
   poisoning. Methods: Following informed consent, a structured
   questionnaire was administered to 119 pregnant women attending antenatal
   clinic services at Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital, west of
   central Johannesburg. Questions were asked about social, demographic and
   residential characteristics, as well as knowledge, perceptions,
   behaviours and practices in relation to child lead hazards. Conclusion:
   Overall awareness of the dangers of lead in pregnancy was low (11\%).
   Amongst those who had heard of it, only 15\% thought that lead could
   cause detrimental health effects. A consequence of this low level of
   awareness of lead hazards is a high potential for the participants and
   their children to unwittingly be exposed to environmental lead from
   various sources, thereby undermining preventative approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Of critical importance for avalanche forecasting, is the ability to draw
   meaningful conclusions from only a handful of field observations. To
   that end, it is common for avalanche forecasters to not only have to
   rely on sparse data, but also on their own intuitive understanding of
   how their field-based observations may be correlated to complex physical
   processes responsible for structural instability within a snowpack. One
   such well-documented basis for mechanical instability to increase within
   a snowpack is that caused by the presence of a buried ice lens or ice
   crust. Although such icy layers are naturally formed and frequently
   encountered in seasonal snowpacks, very little is known about the
   microstructural evolution of these layers and how they contribute toward
   weak layer development. Furthermore, in terms of assessing the
   structural integrity of the snowpack, there is at the present time no
   consistent treatment for identifying these layers a priori as
   problematic or benign. To address this issue, we have created an
   idealized laboratory scenario in which we can study how an artificially
   created ice lens may affect the thermophysical and microstructural state
   of the interface between the ice lens and adjacent layers of snow while
   under a controlled temperature gradient of primarily -100 K m(-1).
   Utilizing in situ micro-thermocouple measurements, our findings show
   that a super-temperature gradient exists within only a millimeter of the
   ice lens surface that is many times greater than the imposed bulk
   temperature gradient Such large temperature gradients on such a small
   scale would not be measurable by most field-based instrumentation and to
   our knowledge these laboratory-based in situ measurements are the first
   of their kind. Additionally, we have also investigated and characterized
   the microstructural evolution of the ice-snow interface with X-ray
   Micro-computed Tomography and Scanning Electron Microscopy. In our
   analysis, we have been able to identify distinct regions of simultaneous
   ice crystal growth, sublimation, and kinetic snow metamorphism. We hold
   that these observations are both consistent with previous laboratory
   studies and observations made in the natural environment. (C) 2015

Title = {{A data mining correlated patterns-based periodic decentralized
   replication strategy for data grids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},

Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{10-27}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Data grids have emerged as a useful technology for managing large
   amounts of distributed data in many fields like scientific experiments
   and engineering applications. In this regard, replication in data grids
   is an efficient technique that aims to improve response time, reduce the
   bandwidth consumption and maintain reliability. Unfortunately, most of
   existing replication strategies consider a single file-based granularity
   and neglect correlations among different data files. However, the
   analysis of many real data intensive applications reveals that jobs and
   applications request groups of correlated files. In this paper, we
   propose a new dynamic periodic decentralized data replication strategy,
   called RSCP1, which considers a set of correlated files as granularity.
   In order to find out these correlations, a new maximal frequent
   correlated pattern mining algorithm of the data mining field is
   introduced. The data in this work is read-only and so there are no
   consistency issues involved. The evaluation metrics we analyze in the
   experiments are mean job execution time, effective network usage, total
   number of replications, hit ratio and percentage of storage filled.
   Using the OptorSim simulator, extensive experimentations show that our
   proposed strategy has better performance in comparison to other
   strategies under most of access patterns. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Increased Compliance With Supervised Rehabilitation Improves Functional
   Outcome and Return to Sport After Anterior Cruciate Ligament
   Reconstruction in Recreational Athletes}},
Journal = {{ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Background: Successful return to sport is an important outcome measure
   after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and a reason for
   patients' decisions to elect surgery. Rehabilitation programs supervised
   by physical therapists are routinely prescribed after ACL reconstruction
   surgery. However, the added advantage of supervised physical therapy
   after ACL reconstruction is still debatable.
   Hypothesis: Attending more supervised physical therapy sessions after
   arthroscopic ACL reconstruction in recreational athletes increases their
   chance of successful return to sport.
   Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods: The authors analyzed 93 recreational athletes who underwent
   arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. After arthroscopic single-bundle ACL
   reconstruction, patients were advised to attend 20 supervised physical
   therapy sessions. Patients' demographics, surgical details, and outcome
   measures (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score {[}KOOS], Lysholm
   scale, and Short Form-36 Health Survey {[}SF-36]) were recorded
   presurgery and at 1-year follow-up. Ability to return to sports was
   documented through patients' self-report. The attendance at physical
   therapy by each patient was obtained by examining database records and
   assessed as fully compliant (> 15 sessions), moderately compliant (6-15
   sessions), or noncompliant (< 6 sessions).
   Results: Patients in the fully compliant group had significantly greater
   odds (odds ratio {[}OR], 18.5; 95\% CI, 1.9-184.5; P =.013) of a
   successful return to sport as compared with the noncompliant group.
   Patients in the moderately compliant group also had greater odds of
   returning to sport as compared with the noncompliant group (OR, 4.2;
   95\% CI, 1.0-16.6; P =.043). Patients in the fully compliant group had
   significantly greater scores on the Lysholm (P <.001), KOOS Sports and
   Recreation subscale (P .021), KOOS Symptoms subscale (P =.040), and
   SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) (P =.012) as compared with the
   noncompliant group. Moderately compliant patients had significantly
   greater scores on the Lysholm (P =.004), KOOS Sports and Recreation (P
   =.026), KOOS Symptoms (P =.041), KOOS Quality of Life (P =.022), and
   SF-36 PCS (P =.004) as compared with noncompliant patients.
   Conclusion: In recreational athletes, moderate to full compliance with a
   supervised physical therapy program predicts improved knee function and
   a greater chance of returning to sport 1 year after ACL reconstruction.}},

   parasitic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) due to the hygroscopicity of
   Gd2O3. By contrast, long O-3 pulses with high N-2 content lead to the
   dehydroxylation of the surface and to the suppression of both the proton

Abstract = {{Electric motors account for 42.9 \% (as of 2010) of electricity
   consumption in the Korean manufacturing sector, which represents 20.9 \%
   of total electric power demand in Korea. Efficient use of motors in the
   manufacturing sector is therefore essential in controlling electric
   power demand in Korea. This study analyzes the potential and economic
   feasibility of reducing electric motor electricity consumption in the
   Korean manufacturing sector. Presently, Korea only enforces minimum
   energy performance standards (MEPS) for three-phase induction electric
   motors rated 200 kW or less, and the industrial electricity price is
   much lower than the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD) average. In addition, load factors of electric motors
   are generally far below optimal efficiency, and variable-speed drive
   (VSD) installation rates are lower than in other advanced countries.
   This study analyzes the amount and cost of reducing electricity
   consumption under each of the following scenarios, modeled as additional
   strategies to the current MEPS, for reducing energy consumption: (1)
   expansion of MEPS enforcement, (2) increasing the industrial electricity
   price, (3) enhancement of motor load factors, and (4) installation of
   VSDs. This study found that increasing the industrial electricity price
   has the largest electricity reduction potential and is economically most
   beneficial to the society.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate validity and
   reliability of autofluorescence-based plaque quantification (APQ)
   method.
   Methods: The facial surfaces of 600 sound anterior teeth of 50 subjects
   were examined. The subjects received dental plaque examination using
   Turesky modified Quigley Hein plaque index (QHI) and Silness \& Loe
   plaque index (SLI). The autofluorescence images were taken before the
   plaque examination with Quantitative Light-induced Fluorescence-Digital,
   and plaque percent index (PPI) was calculated. Correlation between two
   existing plaque indices and the PPI of the APQ method was evaluated to
   find which level of plaque redness on tooth (Delta R) by the APQ method
   shows the highest correlation. The area under the ROC curve (AUC)
   analysis and intra- and inter-examiner reliability tests were performed.
   Results: The PPI Delta R20 of the APQ method showed a moderate
   correlation with two existing plaque indices (rho of QHI = 0.48, SLI =
   0.51). This methodology fell in the fair category and it had an
   excellent reliability. The APQ method also showed possibility to detect
   heavy plaque with fair validity.
   Conclusions: The APQ method demonstrated excellent reliability, and fair
   validity, compared with 2 conventional indices. The plaque
   quantification described has the potential to be used in clinical
   evaluation of oral hygiene procedures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Prohibitin (PHB) participates in several biological processes including
   apoptosis, transcription regulation and suppression of cell
   proliferation in mammals. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA
   of prohibitin 2 (Cf-phb2) from the testis of scallop (Chlamys farreri).
   The deduced amino acid sequence presented a characteristic of PHB family
   with the PHB domain, and clustered with PHB2 of other species. Temporal
   and spatial expression of Cf-phb2 in testis during the reproductive
   cycle was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and in situ
   hybridization. The expression of Cf-phb2 in the testis increased when
   testis developed from the resting stage to mature stage. The mRNA
   abundance of Cf-phb2 was the highest at mature stage, which was about
   15-fold higher than that at proliferative stage. The expression of
   Cf-phb2 could be detected by in situ hybridization in all types of germ
   cells in testis, including spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and
   spermatozoa. The intensity of the signal increased with the
   spermatogenesis and was the highest in spermatids, which suggested that
   CF-PHB2 might affect the spermatogenesis of C. farreri.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing number of campus-related emergency incidents, in
   combination with the requirements imposed by the Clery Act, have
   prompted college campuses to develop emergency notification systems to
   inform community members of extreme events that may affect them. Merely
   deploying emergency notification systems on college campuses, however,
   does not guarantee that these systems will be effective; student
   compliance plays a very important role in establishing such
   effectiveness. Immediate compliance with alerts, as opposed to delayed
   compliance or noncompliance, is a key factor in improving student safety
   on campuses. This paper investigates the critical antecedents that
   motivate students to comply immediately with messages from campus
   emergency notification systems. Drawing on Etzioni's compliance theory,
   a model is developed. Using a scenario-based survey method, the model is
   tested in five types of events-snowstorm, active shooter, building fire,
   health-related, and robbery-and with more than 800 college students from
   the Northern region of the United States. The results from this study
   suggest that subjective norm and information quality trust are, in
   general, the most important factors that promote immediate compliance.
   This research contributes to the literature on compliance, emergency
   notification systems, and emergency response policies.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature sensitivity of optical waveguide microring (MR) is the
   critical factor to influence the performance of MR-based biosensor. An
   athermal MR-based biosensor with intensity interrogation is proposed and
   analyzed. The integrative biosensor chip is composed of sensing unit MR
   and interrogation unit Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with the same
   temperature sensitivity. The resonant wavelength shift of MR by
   temperature change is equal to the center wavelength shift of
   interrogation curve of MZI which cancel with each other during
   interrogation process. The polymer based integrative biosensor chip is
   designed and investigated. The simulation results show that the
   temperature sensitivity of the polymer waveguide biosensor is smaller
   than 1 pm/K with the temperature change between -10 K to 20 K relative
   to the reference temperature 20 degrees C and refractive index change
   from 0 to 0.05. The intensity interrogation method utilizing the power
   ratio between the two output ports of MZI has the flexibility of
   selecting large linear range and high resolution and is immune to output
   power fluctuations of the light source. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Vulva cancer is the fourth leading gynaecological malignancy, accounting
   for approximately 4 \% of all gynaecological cancers. Surgery represents
   the treatment of choice, and cases of advanced or recurrent vulvar
   cancers are to date a major challenge to multidisciplinary teams.
   Abdominoperineal excision (APE) in combination with vulvectomy and
   inguinal lymphadenectomy is the only curative treatment option.
   Patients' files of all women with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva
   who underwent abdominoperineal resection were retrospectively reviewed
   with special regards to technical challenges the general surgeon will
   face. Seven women were enrolled in this retrospective study with a
   median age of 71 years (range 56-79 years). In six patients, the pelvic
   floor after abdominoperineal excision could be closed by direct suture
   of the levator muscles. One woman underwent abdominoperineal resection
   with closure of the defect using a vertical rectus abdominis
   myocutaneous (VRAM) flap. All women underwent radical vulvectomy, in
   five patients in combination with bilateral inguinal lymph node
   dissection. Operation time was 377 min (range 130-505 min). The median
   overall survival after surgery was 27 months (range 4-84 months), with a
   calculated 5-year survival rate of 42 \%. Women with negative lymph
   nodes revealed a longer survival time after surgery compared to women
   with lymph node metastases (15.5 vs. 72 months; p= 0.09).
   Abdominoperineal excisions represent a powerful tool in the
   multidisciplinary treatment regimen of advanced or recurrent vulvar
   cancer. Reconstruction of the pelvic floor usually does not require
   myocutaneous flaps, even when facing large tumours. Despite high
   complication rates, radical surgery was a feasible treatment with
   long-term survival potential without mortality.}},

Abstract = {{We provide a general framework for getting expected linear time constant
   factor approximations (and in many cases FPTAS's) to several well known
   problems in Computational Geometry, such as k-center clustering and
   farthest nearest neighbor. The new approach is robust to variations in
   the input problem, and yet it is simple, elegant, and practical. In
   particular, many of these well studied problems which fit easily into
   our framework, either previously had no linear time approximation
   algorithm, or required rather involved algorithms and analysis. A short
   list of the problems we consider include farthest nearest neighbor,
   k-center clustering, smallest disk enclosing k points, kth largest
   distance, kth smallest m-nearest neighbor distance, kth heaviest edge in
   the MST and other spanning forest type problems, problems involving
   upward closed set systems, and more. Finally, we show how to extend our
   framework such that the linear running time bound holds with high
   probability.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates neural cell survival
   mainly by activating TrkB receptors. Several tines of evidence support a
   key role for BDNF-TrkB signaling in survival of adult retinal ganglion
   cells in animal models of optic nerve injury (ONI), but the
   neuroprotective effect of exogenous BDNF is transient. Glial cells have
   recently attracted considerable attention as mediators of neural cell
   survival, and TrkB expression in retinal glia suggests its role in
   neuroprotection. To elucidate this point directly, we examined the
   effect of ONI on TrkB(flox/flox):glial fibrillary acidic protein
   (GFAP)-Cre+ (TrkB(GFAP)) knockout (KO) mice, in which TrkB is deleted in
   retinal glial cells. ONI markedly increased mRNA expression Levels of
   basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in wild-type (WT) mice but not in
   TrkB(GFAP) KO mice. Immunohistochemical analysis at 7 days after ONI
   (d7) revealed bFGF up-regulation mainly occurred in Muller glia.
   ONI-induced retinal ganglion cell Loss in WT mice was consistently mild
   compared with TrkB(GFAP) KO mice at d7. On the other hand, ONI severely
   decreased TrkB expression in both WT and TrkB(GFAP) KO mice after d7,
   and the severity of retinal degeneration was comparable with TrkB(GFAP)
   KO mice at d14. Our data provide direct evidence that glial TrkB
   signaling plays an important role in the early stage of neural
   protection after traumatic injury.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to find out Ruta graveolens L. functional
   components, which have immobilisation effect on human spermatozoa for
   contraceptive use. A five-step fractionation method was used to derive
   different components from rue aqueous extract by using hexane,
   chloroform, ethanol, acetone and ultrapure water. Gas
   chromatography-mass spectrophotometery (GC-MS) of all fractions and the
   aqueous extract were performed to determine the chemical components. The
   immobilisation assay and membrane integrity test were also performed
   with four different coumarins, which were found in GC-MS in a
   concentration of 10m. Hexane, chloroform, acetone and ethanol fractions
   could significantly decrease motility of sperms within the first and the
   second hours. Hexane fraction had also significant immediate effect. The
   aqueous fraction had no effect on sperm motility. Meanwhile, GC-MS
   revealed that aqueous extract and effective fractions had similar
   coumarin compounds. We performed the immobilisation assay on four
   different coumarins, which were found in GC-MS in a concentration of
   10m. Reduction of sperm motility was only significant for xanthotoxin.
   In the sperm viability and membrane integrity tests, hexane and
   ethanolic fractions could impair sperm vitality significantly, in
   contrast to coumarins. These results indicated that a part of
   immobilising effect of rue could be due to its coumarins. The possible
   mechanism could be blocking of spermatozoa potassium channels.}},

Title = {{Assessing Sagittal Rotation on Posteroanterior Chest Radiographs: The
   Effect of Body Morphology on Radiographic Appearances}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chest radiography is one of the most commonly performed
   radiographic examinations worldwide. Routinely acquired in the erect
   posteroanterior (PA) position, a chest radiograph displays substantial
   amounts of medical information when accurate patient positioning is
   achieved. However, a rotated PA chest radiograph has reduced diagnostic
   quality and appearances may mask or mimic chest pathology. Radiographic
   assessment of patient rotation around the sagittal plane has
   traditionally been undertaken by assessing the distance between the
   medial end of the clavicles and a line drawn through the spinous
   processes at the level of the clavicles. This approach continues to be
   advocated in radiographic technique textbooks internationally although
   no identified author has provided criteria to determine when a rotated
   PA chest radiograph should be repeated; determined the relationship
   between perceived clavicle to spinous process distance and actual degree
   of patient rotation; or considered the impact of body morphology, in
   particular the anteroposterior thoracic diameter, on radiographic
   appearances of rotation.
   Objectives: To determine the impact of anteroposterior chest diameter on
   radiographic appearances of sagittal rotation on PA chest radiographs.
   Design: Experimental study.
   Methods and Settings: Sixty computed tomography thorax examinations,
   stratified for gender, were reviewed and data aggregated to determine
   average anteroposterior (AP) thoracic dimensions. A bespoke experimental
   unit was constructed specifically to enable testing of the impact of
   sagittal rotation on radiographic appearances. The experimental unit was
   situated within a calibrated circular frame enabling 360 degrees
   rotation at 1 degrees intervals around a central rotational point. The
   experimental unit components were varied in 1 cm intervals from 9 cm to
   15 cm around the central rotation point to reflect varying AP chest
   diameters. At each interval, images were acquired at 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, and
   15 degrees sagittal rotation using a horizontal central ray, consistent
   centring point, and a source- image distance of 180 cm. Results: A clear
   linear relationship between AP thoracic diameter and the radiographic
   appearances of sagittal rotation was noted. Considering significant
   rotation to be when the medial end of clavicle overlaps the spinous
   process on the radiographic image, this appearance occurred at a much
   smaller degree of rotation on wide AP thoracic diameters (15 cm, 5
   degrees) than narrower AP thoracic diameters (9 cm, 10 degrees).
   Conclusions: The routine application of the distance between the medial
   end of the clavicles and a line drawn through the spinous processes at
   the level of the clavicles as a method of assessing degree of sagittal
   rotation, diagnostic image quality, and need for repeat is flawed.
   Persistence in the application of this approach without cognisance of
   the impact of body morphology on radiographic appearances will result in
   persons with large AP thoracic diameters being more likely to have a PA
   chest radiograph repeated for a specified degree of rotation than
   persons with smaller AP thoracic diameters.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated manganese (Mn) is a common contaminant issue for mine water
   discharges, and previous studies have reported that its toxicity is
   ameliorated by H+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions. In the present study, the
   toxicity of Mn was assessed in a high risk scenario, that is, the
   slightly acidic, soft waters of Magela Creek, Kakadu National Park,
   Northern Territory, Australia. Toxicity estimates were derived for 6
   tropical freshwater species (Chlorella sp., Lemna aequinoctialis,
   Amerianna cumingi, Moinodaphnia macleayi, Hydra viridissima, and
   Mogurnda mogurnda). Low effect chronic inhibition concentration (IC10)
   and acute lethal concentration (LC05) values ranged between 140gL(-1)
   and 80000gL(-1), with 3 of the species tested (M. macleayi, A. cumingi,
   and H. viridissima) being more sensitive to Mn than all but 1 species in
   the international literature (Hyalella azteca). A loss of Mn was
   observed on the final day for 2 of the H. viridissima toxicity tests,
   which may be a result of the complex speciation of Mn and biological
   oxidation. International data from toxicity tests conducted in natural
   water with a similar physicochemistry to Magela Creek water were
   combined with the present study's data to increase the sample size to
   produce a more reliable species sensitivity distribution. A 99\%
   protection guideline value of 73gL(-1) (33-466gL(-1)) was derived; the
   low value of this guideline value reflects the higher toxicity of Mn in
   slightly acidic soft waters. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:2856-2863. (c)

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{When a crime is committed and an offender is incarcerated, victims and
   offenders are denied agency in influencing the outcome of the criminal
   justice process, resulting in harmful consequences for both. On the one
   hand, there is growing consensus that the criminal justice system does
   not treat victims well. On the other, high levels of violent crime in
   the country, 1 coupled with society's call for stiffer sentences, have
   seen growing numbers of inmates receiving longer prison sentences, due
   in part to the minimum sentence legislation. 2 Restorative approaches to
   justice have the potential to recognise the injustice caused not only by
   the crime itself, but also by the structural injustice experienced by
   the offender. The key question is how to respond to the
   intergenerational effects of historical injustices and victimisation
   that so often result in identity switches: from vulnerable victim to
   violent offender. This article elaborates on restorative approaches to
   corrections at the parole phase and the implementation of these
   approaches through the victim offender dialogue programme, and questions
   whether due regard is being paid to the needs and rights of victims.}},

Abstract = {{Far-Eastern grey voles of the genus Alexandromys are a group of 12
   species distributed exclusively in the Eastern Palearctic.
   Morphologically they are hard to be distinguished due to interspecific
   overlapping of several characters. In recent material of Alexandromys
   morphometric analyses of teeth (in particular the first lower molar)
   proved to be a good tool for species identification, although there are
   overlaps in several measurements. In subfossil and fossil material,
   preliminary analyses indicated considerable variation in tooth
   morphology and, in comparison to extant species, the presence of
   additional morphologically ambiguous forms. In the present study we
   tested in subfossil and fossil teeth of the genus Alexandromys from
   Russian Far East whether taxonomic classification based on morphology is
   in concordance with species determination based on DNA analysis. We also
   asked whether the morphologically ambiguous forms could be assigned to
   described species by means of DNA sequence analysis. The material
   originated from Medvezhyi Klyk Cave Deposits (Primorskyi Krai, Russia)
   and had an age of 2000-40,000 years. The results showed that the success
   rate in PCR amplification was 50\% and it was possible to obtain PCR
   products of >400 bp. The concordance between taxonomic assignment based
   on morphology and genetics was high. Out of 17 samples that were
   successful in the sequence analysis, only one yielded a classification
   that contradicts morphology and one specimen could not be classified
   since the delivered sequence most probably is a numt (nuclear copy of
   mitochondrial origin). Although only one of the four unidentified teeth
   in our sample was successful in the DNA analysis and allowed taxonomic
   assignment, our results suggest that genetic species determination could
   be a valuable tool to classify subfossil and fossil teeth in
   Arvicolinae. (C) 2015 Deutsche Gesellschaft far Saugetierkunde.

Abstract = {{Molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) is a mixed ionic electronic conductor with
   potential applications in energy storage and conversion. There is some
   ambiguity about the nature of the electronic conduction mechanism and
   its temperature dependence. Conductivity data as a function of
   temperature were obtained and explained within the framework of the band
   structure to support the description of MoO2 as a semi-metal. AC Hall
   effect measurements found low electron mobilities as expected for d band
   conduction. Collectively the data supported a combined conduction model
   including residual conductivity, low temperature hopping and impurity
   band conduction from Mo 4d bands degenerate with the conduction band.}},

Abstract = {{Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common primary cutaneous T cell
   lymphoma, which is characterised in its early stages by epidermotropism
   of small to medium-sized T lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei.
   Originally described by Alibert in 1806, MF is classically a disease of
   adults, although children and adolescents can be affected, and it
   typically has a protracted, indolent course. Routine dermatopathology
   practice involves many biopsies submitted with a clinical query
   regarding the possibility of MF. These are not always straightforward,
   as the histological features can be variable and are not always readily
   distinguishable from several other clinical differential diagnoses.
   Whilst modern molecular testing modalities can assist, even these do not
   always enable a definitive diagnosis of MF in its early stages. We have
   reviewed the histopathological features of early MF and currently
   recognised subtypes and the role of immunohistochemistry and emerging
   molecular techniques in the diagnosis of this condition. We also outline
   our approach to a biopsy where the question of `Could it be MF?' has
   been proposed.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-D numerical simulation of an industrial-sized slab caster for
   magnesium alloy AZ91 has been carried out for the steady state
   operational phase of the caster. The simulated model consists of an
   open-top melt delivery system fitted with a porous filter near the
   hot-top. The melt flow through the porous filter was modeled on the
   basis of Brinkmann-Forchimier-Extended non-Darcy model for turbulent
   flow. An in-house 3-D CFD code was modified to account for the melt flow
   through the porous filter. Results are obtained for four casting speeds
   namely, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mm/min. The metal-mold contact region as
   well as the convective heat transfer coefficient at the mold wall were
   also varied. In addition to the above, the Darcy number for the porous
   media was also changed. All parametric studies were performed for a
   fixed inlet melt superheat of 64 degrees C. The results are presented
   pictorially in the form of temperature and velocity fields. The sump
   depth, mushy region thickness, solid shell thickness at the exit of the
   mold and axial temperature profiles are also presented and correlated
   with the casting speed through regression analysis. (C) 2015 Production

Abstract = {{Objective/background: The aim of this study is to determine the rate of
   hookworm infection among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and
   to find out if there is a relation between hookworm infection and the
   therapeutic failure of pulmonary TB.
   Methods: We carried out a prospective, hospital-based study. The study
   included 231 naive patients with pulmonary TB, consecutively. Patients
   were evaluated at the 4th month of therapy for persistence of
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. All patients had clinical
   evaluation, laboratory investigations (including sputum culture and
   stool microscopic examination), and imaging studies (abdominal
   ultrasonography and chest radiography).
   Results: The study population mean age was 42.7 +/- 13.9 years old with
   26.8\% of them 40 years old or more. Out of 231 patients, 133 (57.6\%)
   were men. Therapeutic failure rate of pulmonary TB was 29.4\%. Hookworm
   infection was diagnosed among 16.5\% of patients and 27.7\% had diabetes
   mellitus (DM). Using multivariate analysis, it was found that age of 40
   years or more (odds ratio {[}OR] 8.4; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   1.7-41.3; p =.009), hookworm infection (OR 7.6; 95\% CI 1.2-49.9; p =
   .034), and DM (OR 5.9; 1.2-28; p = .027) were independently associated
   with therapeutic failure of pulmonary TB among the study population with
   pulmonary TB.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, the rate of therapeutic failure of pulmonary
   TB is high. Besides older age and DM, hookworm infection can reduce the
   therapeutic response of pulmonary TB. Screening for and control of DM
   and hookworm infection among patients with pulmonary TB may improve
   their therapeutic response. (C) 2015 Asian African Society for

Abstract = {{Since 2009, the peritoneal dialysis (PD) registry survey has been
   carried out as part of the annual nationwide survey conducted by the
   Statistical Survey Committee of the Japanese Society for Dialysis
   Therapy with the cooperation of the Japanese Society for Peritoneal
   Dialysis. In this report, the current status of PD patients is presented
   on the basis of the results of the survey conducted at the end of 2012.
   The subjects were PD patients who lived in Japan and participated in the
   2012 survey. Descriptive analysis of various items was performed, which
   included the current status of the combined use of PD and another
   dialysis method such as hemodialysis (HD) or hemodiafiltration (HDF),
   the method of exchanging dialysate, the use of an automated peritoneal
   dialysis (APD) machine, and the rates of peritonitis and catheter
   exit-site infection. From the results of the facility survey in 2012,
   the number of PD patients was 9514, a decrease of 128 from 2011. Among
   the entire dialysis patient population, 3.1\% were PD patients, a
   decrease of 0.1\%. Among the studied patients, 347 had a peritoneal
   catheter and underwent peritoneal lavage, 175 were started on PD in 2012
   but introduced to other blood purification methods in the same year, and
   1932 underwent both PD and another dialysis method such asHDorHDF. The
   percentage of patients who underwent PD and another dialysis method
   increased with PD vintage: <1 year, 4.8\%; 1 to <2 years, 9.2\%; 2 to <4
   years, 16.3\%; 4 to <8 years, 32.0\%; and >= 8 years, 47.5\%. The
   percentage of PD patients who completely manually exchanged the
   dialysate was 29.8\%. The percentages of PD patients who used a
   double-bag exchange system with ultraviolet-light irradiation and those
   who used the same system but with a sterile connecting device were 54.7
   and 13.9\%, respectively. The percentage of patients on PD for <1 year
   using an APD machine was 43.4\%, and it decreased with a PD vintage of
   >= 2 years. The mean rate of peritonitis was 0.22 per patient per year.
   The mean rate of catheter exit-site infections was 0.36 per patient per
   year.}},

Abstract = {{Viral dynamic modelling has proven useful for designing clinical studies
   and predicting treatment outcomes for patients infected with the
   hepatitis C virus. Generally these models aim to capture and predict the
   on-treatment viral load dynamics from a small study of individual
   patients. Here, we explored extending these models (1) to clinical
   studies with numerous patients and (2) by incorporating additional data
   types, including sequence data and prior response to interferon. Data
   from Phase 3 clinical studies of the direct-acting antiviral telaprevir
   (T; total daily dose of 2250 mg) combined with pegylated-interferon alfa
   and ribavirin (PR) were used for the analysis. The following data in the
   treatment-na < ve population were reserved to verify the model: (1) a
   T/PR regimen where T was dosed every 8 h for 8 weeks (T8(q8h)/PR) and
   (2) a T/PR regimen where T was dosed twice daily for 12 weeks
   (T12(b.i.d.)/PR). The resulting model accurately predicted (1) sustained
   virologic response rates for both of these dosing regimens and (2) viral
   breakthrough characteristics of the T8(q8h)/PR regimen. Since the
   observed viral variants depend on the T exposure, the second
   verification suggested that the model was correctly sensitive to the
   different T regimen even though the model was developed using data from
   another T regimen. Furthermore, the model predicted that b.i.d. T dosing
   was comparable to q8h T dosing in the PR-experienced population, a
   comparison that has not been made in a controlled clinical study. The
   methods developed in this work to estimate the variability occurring
   below the limit of detection for the viral load were critical for making
   accurate predictions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology to develop multivariate loss functions
   to measure the operational loss of process facilities. The proposed
   methodology uses loss functions to provide a model for operational loss
   due to deviation of key process characteristics from their target
   values. Having estimated the marginal loss functions for each monitored
   process variable, copula functions are then used to link the univariate
   margins and develop the multivariate loss function. The maximum
   likelihood evaluation method is used to estimate the copula parameters.
   Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is then applied to rank the copula
   models and choose the best fitting copula. A simulation study is
   provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the copula estimation
   procedure. The flexibility of the proposed approach in using any form of
   the symmetrical and asymmetrical loss functions and the practical
   application of the methodology are illustrated using a separation column
   case study. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

   Thompson Reuters in 2012. Data was collected running an advanced search
   limiting the results to the papers published with their address belong
   to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Nearly, 28,000 scientific papers were
   analyzed. The separate analysis on the provincial affiliation of the
   authors was made. Contribution of each province was analyzed against
   selected developmental indicators such as human development indicator
   (HDI), family size, healthcare centers, population, universities and
   students. Findings showed that there is significant relationship between
   science infrastructure and developmental indicators and also their
   contribution to the knowledge. But amongst them relationship between
   family size and science production was negative. Based on findings it is
   concluded that scientific progress has its grassroots in developmental
   programs and in turn, developmental achievements will flourish the

Abstract = {{Dietary fat is known to modulate plasma lipid profiles. Synthesis of
   high density lipoproteins (HDL), which has protective effects on
   vascular disease is also influenced by dietary fats, but the mechanisms
   are unclear. The hapoB100XCETP transgenic mouse was used to investigate
   the effects of fatty acids on the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins,
   including the pathway leading to synthesis HDL. Male transgenic mice
   were fed with diets formulated to provide TG (33\% energy) as
   tripalmitin (TP), triolein (TO), tristearin (TS) or equicaloric
   substitution of fat with carbohydrate (sucrose) for 4 weeks. Analysis of
   plasma profile showed that HDL-cholesterol were 53.7+14; 64.6+8.6;
   50.2+3.3; 47.0+9.2 and 45.2+4.9 mg/dL for control, oleate, palmitate,
   stearate and sucrose based diets, respectively. LDL-cholesterol levels
   were 51.7+7.0; 23.1+7.0; 38.9+2.2; 75.1+1.8 and 46.8.1.0 mg/dl, for
   control, TO, TP, TS and sucrose, respectively. Hepatic
   Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) protein levels increased by
   2-fold in mice fed TS or TO diets, compared to TP, while sucrose had no
   effect. The scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-B1) which plays an
   important role in meditating the uptake of HDL-derived cholesterol and
   cholesteryl ester in the liver and steroidogenic tissues increased in
   livers of animals fed TP and TO, while TS and sucrose did not have a
   similar effects. These results suggests that fatty acids can uniquely
   impact HDL, in addition, the ApoB100XCETP mouse is a useful model for
   the evaluation of how dietary components affect the risk of developing
   atherosclerosis and heart disease.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{445-463}},

Abstract = {{Earth may now be moving into a new epoch, the Anthropocene, in which
   human activities have become a significant geological force altering
   (and often undermining) the planet's life-sustaining systems. In this
   context, Thomas Berry suggests that humanity's key task is to create a
   viable niche for itself that simultaneously enables the Earth community
   as a whole to thrive, effectively inaugurating an ecological epoch.
   Stephen Scharper proposes that this transition entails a shift from
   anthropocentrism to anthropoharmonism. Anthropoharmonism recognizes the
   unique perspective (and power) of humans, but also recognizes that
   humans are wholly dependent on the wider Earth community and need to act
   in harmony with it. Moving from ethics to practice requires an
   ecological wisdom that enables humans to discern actions that are
   mutually enhancing for ourselves and Earth's ecosystems. Building on
   Arne Naess' idea that ecosophia must be ``directly relevant for
   action{''} as well as Aristotle's understanding of phronesis or
   ``ethical know-how,{''} this kind of wisdom can be understood as an
   anthropoharmonic phronesis that focuses on healing the Earth community,
   using sustainable practices and technologies appropriate for specific
   contexts. Such a phronesis can be found in permaculture, a design system
   founded by Bill Mollison and David Holgrem which provides a concrete set
   of guidelines for discerning ecologically appropriate actions in
   specific contexts based on an ethic of care of Earth, care of people,
   and fair share. Key principles include using small and slow solutions,
   designing from patterns to details, and creatively responding to change.
   Like anthropoharmonism, permaculture envisions a role for humans as
   responsive participants in ecosystems who must first engage in
   protracted observation and only intervene with the minimal change
   necessary to achieve a goal. Permaculture can therefore be understood as
   a way to embody a practical, anthropoharmonic wisdom that could
   facilitate a shift toward an ecological epoch.}},

Abstract = {{Background We aimed to evaluate if vertebrobasilar anatomic variations
   impact reperfusion and outcome in intra-arterial therapy (IAT) for
   basilar artery occlusion (BAO).
   Methods Consecutive BAO patients with symptom onset <24h treated with
   IAT were included. Vertebral artery (VA) V3 and posterior communicating
   artery (PCoA) diameters were measured (CT angiography or MR
   angiography). The presence of PCoA atresia, VA hypoplasia, VAs that end
   in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), and extracranial VA
   occlusion was recorded.
   Results 38 BAO patients were included. Mean age was 6315years; 52\% were
   men. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 21
   +/- 9, and mean/median time from symptom onset to IAT were 10/7h. First
   generation thrombectomy devices were mostly used. Overall Treatment in
   Cerebral Ischemia 2b-3 reperfusion was 68.4\%. Good outcome (modified
   Rankin Scale score 2) was observed in 17.8\% and mortality in 64.3\% of
   cases at 90 days. 55\% of patients had an atretic PCoA while 47\% had a
   hypoplastic VA. The mean sum of the bilateral PCoA and VA diameters were
   2.3 +/- 1.2 and 5.2 +/- 5.2mm, respectively. VAs that end in the PICA
   was noted in 23\% of patients, and extracranial VA occlusion in 42\%.
   BAO was proximal/mid/distal in 36\%/29\%/34\%. Multivariate linear
   regression analysis indicated hypertensive disease (=2.97; 95\% CI 1.15
   to 4.79; p<0.01) and reperfusion rate (=-0.40; 95\% CI -0.74 to -0.70;
   p=0.02) independently associated with outcome. Multivariate analysis for
   predictors of reperfusion failed to identify other associations. A trend
   for better reperfusion with stent retrievers was noted (=1.82; 95\% CI
   -0.24 to 3.88; p=0.08).
   Conclusions Reperfusion emerged as a predictor of good outcome in
   patients that underwent IAT for BAO. Angioarchitectural variations of
   the posterior circulation were not found to impact reperfusion or
   clinical outcome.}},

Abstract = {{As a series of endeavors to establish suitable measures for the sound
   development of regenerative medicine using human stem cell-based
   products, we studied scientific principles, concepts and basic technical
   elements to ensure the quality and safety of therapeutic products
   derived from allogeneic human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells)
   or iPS cell-like cells, taking into consideration scientific and
   technological advances, ethics, regulatory rationale, and international
   trends in human stem cell-derived products. This led to the development
   of the Japanese official Notification No. 0907-5, ``Guideline on
   Ensuring the Quality and Safety of Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices
   Derived from the Processing of Allogeneic Human Induced Pluripotent
   Stem(-Like) Cells,{''} issued by Pharmaceuticals and Food Safety Bureau,
   Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, on September 7, 2012.
   The present paper addresses various aspects of products derived from
   allogeneic human iPS cells (or iPS cell-like cells), in addition to
   similar points to consider that are described previously for allogeneic
   human stem cell-based products. Major additional points include 1)
   possible existence of allogeneic human iPS cell-like cells that are
   different from iPS cells in specific biological features; 2) the use of
   allogeneic human iPS(-like) cells as appropriate starting materials for
   regenerative medicine, where necessary and significant; 3) establishment
   of an allogeneic human iPS(like) cell line and its characterization; 4)
   establishment of well-characterized stable cell banks and relevant
   intermediate cell products, if necessary; 5) concerns about the presence
   of undifferentiated cells in final products; such cells may cause
   ectopic tissue formation and/or tumorigenesis; and 6) concerns about
   undesirable immunological reactions that may be caused by the final
   products. The ultimate goal of this guidance is to provide suitable
   medical opportunities as soon as possible to the patients with severe
   diseases that are difficult to treat with conventional modalities. (C)

Abstract = {{Linseed oil, a renewable material obtained from the ripened seeds of the
   flax plant, was conjugated with C. I. Disperse Red 1 to yield a coloured
   macromolecule in two experimentally-simplistic coupling steps. Firstly,
   the abundant presence of carbon carbon double bonds in linseed oil was
   exploited to introduce carboxylic acid functionality to linseed oil via
   a thiol-ene reaction between linseed oil and 3-mercaptopropionic acid.
   C. I. Disperse Red 1 was then grafted to the carboxylic acid units now
   present via esterification, offering a coloured product in high yields.
   On average, 39.2\% of the carbon carbon double bonds in each linseed oil
   molecule were furnished with a C. I. Disperse Red 1 molecule. The
   remaining carbon carbon double bonds may therefore be further exploited
   for chemical crosslinking, ensuring that the product formed is of
   potential significance as a coloured, bio-based, surface coating
   product. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective. Relapsing polychondritis is a rare disease characterized by
   cartilage inflammation. Our aim was to estimate the incidence,
   prevalence and mortality of relapsing polychondritis and describe the
   clinical features of relapsing polychondritis in a large population.
   Methods. All participants diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis were
   sampled from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Prevalence and
   incidence rates for 1990 - 2012 were estimated. Relative mortality rates
   were estimated in a time- to- event framework using reference UK life
   tables. A questionnaire validation study assessed diagnostic accuracy.
   Results. There were 117 participants with relapsing polychondritis ever
   recorded. Fifty ( 82\%) of 61 cases were validated by a physician and
   unconfirmed cases were excluded. The analysis included 106 participants
   ( 42 men, 64 women) diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis. The mean
   age ( range) at diagnosis in men was 55 ( range 17 - 81) years and in
   women 51 ( range 11 -79) years. The median interval from first symptom
   to diagnosis was 1.9 years. The incidence of relapsing polychondritis
   between 1990 and 2012 was 0.71 ( 95\% CI 0.55, 0.91) per million
   population per year. There were 19 deaths from any cause. There were 16
   observed deaths eligible for survival analysis and 7.4 deaths expected
   for the UK population of the same age, sex and period. The standardized
   mortality ratio was 2.16 ( 95\% CI 1.24, 3.51), P< 0.01. Respiratory
   disease, cardiac conditions and cancer were the most frequent causes of
   death. Conclusion. The incidence of relapsing polychondritis may be
   lower than previously estimated, and diagnostic misclassification and
   delay are common. Mortality in relapsing polychondritis is more than
   twice that of the general population.}},

Abstract = {{Polymers with both low water uptake and a low dielectric constant have
   seen interest from both the electronic and microelectronic industries
   for several years. They play a crucial role in maintaining the good
   operating situation of devices, whereas most other materials are
   unsatisfactory. In this contribution, two new fluoropolymers are
   reported, which are derived from the thermo-crosslinking reaction of
   functional monomers containing perfluorocyclobutane and benzocyclobutene
   moieties. These polymers show water uptake ranging from 0.11 to 0.31\%
   after immersion in boiling water (near 98 degrees C) for 96 h, and
   exhibit dielectric constants (k) of below 2.4 at a range of frequencies
   from 0.1 MHz to 30 MHz. In contrast, a comparative polymer without
   perfluorocyclobutane units has a k value of more than 2.70 and water
   uptake of 0.67\%, respectively, suggesting that the low water absorption
   and dielectric constants of the fluoropolymers can be attributed to the
   existence of perfluorocyclobutane groups in the molecular backbone.
   These results also indicate that the properties of the fluoropolymers
   are superior to these of the most commercial polymeric low-k materials,
   implying that these fluoropolymers could be used as the varnish for
   enameled wire in the electrical industry and as encapsulation resins in
   the microelectronics industry.}},

Abstract = {{We wished to establish a mouse model of hypospadias using injections of
   estradiol benzoate for investigating the molecular mechanisms of
   hypospadias. Fifty timed pregnant mice were randomly divided into five

   subcutaneously with estradiol benzoate mixed with sesame oil at,
   respectively, the doses of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, or 12.5 mg kg(-1) days(-1)
   from gestation day (GD) 12 to GD 16. The pups' mortality was recorded on
   the day of delivery. Urethras and positions of testes were examined on
   postnatal day 28. The numbers of live pups were significantly lower in
   the study groups D and E compared to study group A (p < 0.01).
   Hypospadias was seen in groups C (3.3 \%; 1/30), D (18.2 \%; 4/22), and
   E (21.4 \%; 3/14), while cryptorchidism was observed in groups C (10 \%;

Abstract = {{Hyperglycemia and diabetes are associated with endothelial cell
   dysfunction arising from enhanced oxidative injury, leading to the
   progression of diabetic vascular pathologies. The redox-sensitive
   transcription factor nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a
   master regulator of antioxidant genes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1),
   involved in cellular defenses against oxidative stress. We have
   investigated the pathways involved in high glucose-induced activation of
   HO-1 in endothelial cells and examined the molecular mechanisms
   underlying cytoprotection. Elevated D-glucose increased intracellular
   generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to nuclear
   translocation of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in bovine aortic endothelial
   cells, with no changes in cell viability. Superoxide scavenging and
   inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) abrogated
   upregulation of HO-1 expression by elevated glucose. Inhibition of HO-1
   increased the sensitivity of endothelial cells to high glucose-mediated
   damage, while addition of bilirubin restored cell viability. Our
   findings establish that exposure of endothelial cells to high glucose
   leads to activation of endogenous antioxidant defense genes via the
   Nrf2/ARE pathway. Upregulation of HO-1 provides cytoprotection against
   high glucose-induced oxidative stress through the antioxidant properties
   of bilirubin. Modulation of the Nrf2 pathway in the early stages of
   diabetes may thus protect against sustained damage by hyperglycemia
   during progression of the disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this research a type of wood plastic composites (TR-WPCs) is prepared
   by blending tea residue (TR) with high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The
   chemical composition of TR was analyzed quantitatively. The effects of
   TR content, compatibilizers, and nanofillers on the structure,
   morphology, and mechanical properties were studied. The results showed
   that the stiffness of TR-WPCs was significantly improved with the
   increase in TR, while the strength and toughness decreased. Scanning
   electron microscope indicated that the maleic anhydride grafted
   polyethylene as compatibilizer enhanced interface adhesion of the
   composites; Thermo-gravimetric analysis and Vicat test showed that the
   composite made with the nanofiller could improve the heat stability and
   heat resistance. Differential scanning calorimetry indicated that the
   addition of inorganic fillers slightly influenced the crystallization
   behavior of the HDPE matrix. The TR with boiling water treatment could
   significantly improve the mechanical properties of the composites. (C)

Abstract = {{Tibetan wild barley is a treasure trove of useful genes for crop
   improvement including abiotic stress tolerance, like drought. Root hair
   of single-celled structures plays an important role in water and
   nutrition uptake. Polyethyleneglycol-induced drought stress
   hydroponic/petri-dish experiments were performed, where root hair
   morphology and transcriptional characteristics of two contrasting
   Tibetan wild barley genotypes (drought-tolerant XZ5 and
   drought-sensitive XZ54) and drought-tolerant cv. Tadmor were compared.
   Drought-induced root hair growth was only observed in XZ5. Thirty-six
   drought tolerance-associated genes were identified in XZ5, including 16
   genes specifically highly expressed in XZ5 but not Tadmor under drought.
   The full length cDNA of a novel beta-expansin gene (HvEXPB7), being the
   unique root hair development related gene in the identified genes, was
   cloned. The sequence comparison indicated that HvEXPB7 carried both
   DPBB\_1 and Pollon\_allerg\_1 domains. HvEXPB7 is predominantly
   expressed in roots. Subcellular localization verified that HvEXPB7 is
   located in the plasma membrane. Barley stripe mosaic virus induced gene
   silencing (BSMV-VIGS) of HvEXPB7 led to severely suppressed root hairs
   both under control and drought conditions, and significantly reduced K
   uptake. These findings highlight and confer the significance of HvEXPB7
   in root hair growth under drought stress in XZ5, and provide a novel
   insight into the genetic basis for drought tolerance in Tibetan wild
   barley.}},

Abstract = {{This work is focused on the role of porous titanium (Ti) substrate on

Title = {{Petrogenesis of the Devonian high-Mg rock association and its tectonic
   implication for the Chinese Altai orogenic belt, NW China}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The Chinese Altai is a key region to decipher the accretionary history
   of the gigantic CAOB, one of the largest accretionary orogenic belts on
   the earth. However, tectonic implication of the widely distributed
   Paleozoic magmatic rocks remain debated. In this study, a suite of
   igneous rocks, including high Mg dacite of the Kangbutiebao Formation
   and the associated gneissic granodiorites, have been studied for their
   petrogenesis and tectonic implication. The high Mg dacite is dated at
   400 +/- 2 Ma, which broadly resembles the emplacement age of the high Mg
   gneissic granodiorites of 406 +/- 9 Ma, possibly suggesting that they
   were generated in the same tectono-magmatic event. Both rocks have
   predominant zircon inheritances of similar to 500 Ma, which is
   consistent with the age of predominant zircon population for the
   widespread Habahe sedimentary sequence, indicating that their precursor
   magmas were probably mainly derived from the Habahe sediments. The
   high-Mg rock association has similar REE and trace element patterns to
   those of the Habahe sediments and they plot close to the field of the
   Habahe sediments in Th/Ta versus La/Ta diagram. Their high A/CNK ratios
   (1.33-2.05) imply, magma source dominated by sedimentary rocks.
   Similarly, their high La/Sm ratios also suggest a greater contribution
   of sediments rather than altered oceanic crust in the magma generation.
   However, the high Mg\# values (similar to 51) of the studied rocks argue
   against derivation purely from remelting of the Habahe sediments. In
   order to explain the high Mg\# values of these rocks, the participation
   of mantle-derived melt into the precursor magma is considered. Zircons
   from this rock association mostly yield epsilon(Hf)(t) values from +0.85
   to +9.71, supporting the involvement of juvenile materials in the magma
   generation. Samples from the high Mg rock association fall in the same
   field as the sanukitoids in TiO2 versus Mg\# and Sr/Y versus Y diagrams,
   and they plot in the fractional crystallization trend of differentiated
   sanukitoids in Harker diagram, possibly suggesting a petrogenetic
   process like the typical sanukitoid magma elsewhere. This study shows
   that similar to the sanukitoids in the Setouchi area, our high Mg rock
   association also involved melting of subducted sediments in a hot
   subduction regime. Combined with previous work, a ridge subduction
   regime is considered to interpret the early Devonian tectonic evolution
   of the Chinese Altai. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Human populations around the world encounter various environmental
   challenges and, consequently, develop genetic adaptations to different
   selection forces. Identifying the differences in natural selection
   between populations is critical for understanding the roles of specific
   genetic variants in evolutionary adaptation. Although numerous methods
   have been developed to detect genetic loci under recent directional
   selection, a probabilistic solution for testing and quantifying
   selection differences between populations is lacking. Here we report the
   development of a probabilistic method for testing and estimating
   selection differences between populations. By use of a probabilistic
   model of genetic drift and selection, we showed that logarithm odds
   ratios of allele frequencies provide estimates of the differences in
   selection coefficients between populations. The estimates approximate a
   normal distribution, and variance can be estimated using genome-wide
   variants. This allows us to quantify differences in selection
   coefficients and to determine the confidence intervals of the estimate.
   Our work also revealed the link between genetic association testing and
   hypothesis testing of selection differences. It therefore supplies a
   solution for hypothesis testing of selection differences. This method
   was applied to a genome-wide data analysis of Han and Tibetan
   populations. The results confirmed that both the EPAS1 and EGLN1 genes
   are under statistically different selection in Han and Tibetan
   populations. We further estimated differences in the selection
   coefficients for genetic variants involved in melanin formation and
   determined their confidence intervals between continental population
   groups. Application of the method to empirical data demonstrated the
   outstanding capability of this novel approach for testing and
   quantifying differences in natural selection.}},

Title = {{Characterization and scoring of skin changes in severe acute
   malnutrition in children between 6 months and 5 years of age}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background Severe acute malnutrition is a life-threatening condition. It
   can be associated with severe skin changes, first properly described by
   Williams in 1933. The aetiology of these skin changes is still unknown
   and their character has never been systematically described in
   dermatological terms. The skin changes have been shown to be a predictor
   of mortality in hospital care. Systematic investigations on the
   character of the skin changes that have effect on prognosis, are needed
   to investigate which of the skin changes that are relevant to improve
   treatment.
   Objectives Our main objective was to identify the skin changes
   characteristic of children with severe acute malnutrition and to develop
   a clinical score that describes the morphology and severity in
   dermatological terms. We also investigated if any of the different skin
   changes were connected to prognosis.
   Materials and methods At Mulago Hospital, Mwanamugimu (Department of
   Paediatrics and Child Health), Uganda, 120 children were included over a
   period of six months and observed when treated for severe acute
   malnutrition. Skin changes were registered through clinical examination
   and photo documentation and associated to prognosis using Cox and
   logistic regression analysis.
   Results Skin manifestations were characterized by five objective skin
   signs: telogenic effluvium, pigmentary changes (hyper- and
   hypo-pigmentation), ichthyosiform skin changes, lichenoid skin changes
   and bullae-erosion-desquamation. The skin changes could be registered in
   a systematic manner using our simple clinical score. Lichenoid skin
   changes were a significant predictor of death and allowed improved
   accuracy of prediction of mortality.
   Conclusions The clinical score is simple and practical. A standardized
   way to register and score the skin changes, will allow a more unified
   way of reporting results in future studies. The standardization of
   observations, obtained through the proposed scoring system, will enable
   comparison of study results in the future.}},

Title = {{Boswellic acids target the human immune system-modulating antimicrobial
   peptide LL-37}},
Journal = {{PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{53-60}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is the sole member of the human
   cathelicidin family with immune system-modulating properties and roles
   in autoimmune disease development. Small molecules able to interact with
   LL-37 and to modulate its functions have not been described yet.
   Boswellic acids (BAs) are pentacyclic triterpene acids that are
   bioactive principles of frankincense extracts used as anti-inflammatory
   remedies. Although various anti-inflammatory modes of action have been
   proposed for BAs, the pharmacological profile of these compounds is
   still incompletely understood. Here, we describe the identification of
   human LL-37 as functional target of BAs. In unbiased target fishing
   experiments using immobilized BAs as bait and human neutrophils as
   target source, LL-37 was identified as binding partner assisted by
   MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Thermal stability experiments using
   circular dichroism spectroscopy confirm direct interaction between BAs
   and LL-37. Of interest, this binding of BAs resulted in an inhibition of
   the functionality of LL-37. Thus, the LPS-neutralizing properties of
   isolated LL-37 were inhibited by 3-O-acetyl-beta-BA (A beta-BA) and
   3-O-acetyl-11-keto-beta-BA (AK beta-BA) in a cell-free limulus
   amoebocyte lysate assay with EC50=0.2 and 0.8 mu M, respectively. Also,
   LL-37 activity was inhibited by these BAs in LL-37-enriched supernatants
   of stimulated neutrophils or human plasma derived from stimulated human
   whole blood. Together, we reveal BAs as inhibitors of LL-37, which might
   be a relevant mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory properties of
   BAs and suggests BAs as suitable chemical tools or potential agents for
   intervention with LL-37 and related disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A generalized Suzuki-Trotter (GST) method for the solution of an optimal
   control problem for quantum molecular systems is presented in this work.
   The control of such systems gives rise to aminimization problem with
   constraints given by a system of coupled Schrodinger equations. The
   computational bottleneck of the corresponding minimization methods is
   the solution of time-dependent Schrodinger equations. To solve the
   Schrodinger equations we use the GST framework to obtain an explicit
   polynomial approximation of the matrix exponential function. The GST
   method almost exclusively uses the action of the Hamiltonian and is
   therefore efficient and easy to implement for a variety of quantum
   systems. Following a first discretize, then optimize approach we derive
   the correct discrete representation of the gradient and the Hessian. The
   derivatives can naturally be expressed in the GST framework and can
   therefore be efficiently computed. By recomputing the solutions of the
   Schrodinger equations instead of saving the whole time evolution, we are
   able to significantly reduce the memory requirements of the method at
   the cost of additional computations. This makes first and second order
   optimization methods viable for large scale problems. In numerical
   experiments we compare the performance of different first and second
   order optimization methods using the GST method. We observe fast local
   convergence of second order methods.}},

Title = {{Classification Based on Speech Rhythm via a Temporal Alignment of Spoken
   Sentences}},

Abstract = {{How much information is contained in the rhythm of speech? Is it
   possible to tell, just from the rhythm of the speech, whether the
   speaker is male or female? Is it possible to tell if they are a native
   or nonnative speaker? This paper provides a new way to address such
   questions. Traditional investigations into speech rhythm approach the
   problem by manually annotating the speech, and investigating a
   preselected collection of features such as the durations of vowels or
   inter-phoneme timings. This paper presents a method that can
   automatically align the audio of multiple people when speaking the same
   sentence. The output of the alignment procedure is a mapping (from the
   micro-timing of one speaker to that of another) that can be used as a
   surrogate for speech rhythm. The method is applied to a large online
   corpus of speakers and shows that it is possible to classify the
   speakers based on these mappings alone. Several technical aspects are
   discussed. First, the spectrograms switch between different-length
   analysis windows (based on whether the speech is voiced or unvoiced) to
   ameliorate the time-frequency trade-off. These variable window
   spectrograms are fed into a dynamic time warping algorithm to produce a
   timing map which represents the speech rhythm. The accuracy of the
   alignment is evaluated by a technique of transitive validation, and the
   timing maps are used to form a feature vector for the classification.
   The method is applied to the online Speech Accent Archive corpus. In the
   gender discrimination experiments, the proposed method was only about
   5\% worse than a state-of-the-art classifier based on spectral feature
   vectors. In the native speaker discrimination task, the speech rhythm
   was about 15\% better than when using spectral information.}},

Abstract = {{Transposable element activity is repressed in the germline in animals by
   PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of small RNAs produced by
   genomic loci mostly composed of TE sequences. The mechanism of induction

   maternal inheritance of a cytoplasm containing homologous piRNAs. This
   activated state is stably transmitted over generations and allows
   trans-silencing of a homologous transgenic target in the female
   germline. Such an epigenetic conversion displays the functional
   characteristics of a paramutation, i.e., a heritable epigenetic
   modification of one allele by the other. We report here that piRNA
   production and trans-silencing capacities of the paramutated cluster
   depend on the function of the rhino, cutoff, and zucchini genes involved
   in primary piRNA biogenesis in the germline, as well as on that of the
   aubergine gene implicated in the ping-pong piRNA amplification step. The
   21-nt RNAs, which are produced by the paramutated cluster, in addition
   to 23- to 28-nt piRNAs are not necessary for paramutation to occur.
   Production of these 21-nt RNAs requires Dicer-2 but also all the piRNA
   genes tested. Moreover, cytoplasmic transmission of piRNAs homologous to
   only a subregion of the transgenic locus can generate a strong
   paramutated locus that produces piRNAs along the whole length of the
   transgenes. Finally, we observed that maternally inherited transgenic
   small RNAs can also impact transgene expression in the soma. In
   conclusion, paramutation involves both nuclear (Rhino, Cutoff) and
   cytoplasmic (Aubergine, Zucchini) actors of the piRNA pathway. In
   addition, since it is observed between nonfully homologous loci located
   on different chromosomes, paramutation may play a crucial role in
   epigenome shaping in Drosophila natural populations.}},

Title = {{Systematic planning of disconnection to enhance conservation success in
   a modified world}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining spatial-temporal connectivity for conservation is necessary
   to allow the persistence of ecological processes and the biodiversity
   they sustain. However, conservation practice in human-modified
   environments can also benefit from prescribed disconnection through the
   implementation of barriers. Barriers, such as fences or dams, and buffer
   zones can be a cost-effective way of addressing threats caused by a
   globally connected world, such as the propagation of invasive species
   and diseases, creating refuge areas for native biodiversity and helping
   reduce economic losses caused by native wildlife or invasive species.
   Despite the global attention that disconnection has received, no clear
   framework exists to guide the allocation of barriers for conservation
   management. Here we propose that the implementation of barriers for
   conservation should be systematically planned, considering ecological
   trade-offs for multiple species (easing threats vs. interruption of
   ecosystem-processes) and socio-economic cost-benefits (implementation
   cost vs. reduced human-wildlife conflicts), rather than using ad-hoc
   opportunistic criteria or accommodating conservation needs for
   individual species. Such a systematic approach is necessary to ensure
   both socially acceptable and ecologically effective use of
   disconnections as a conservation tool and ideally planned across
   different realms so co-benefits or trade-offs can be accounted for.
   However, any implementation of disconnection for conservation should be
   cautiously considered if uncertainty in effectiveness of the barrier and
   ecological impacts to other species are high. We also suggest the need
   for improved approaches to monitoring to learn from previous successes
   and failures. Our recommendations should guide the systematic evaluation
   and allocation of barriers to help enhance the value of this
   conservation tool in the face of increasing propagation of threats
   worldwide. However, new tools and collaborative frameworks across
   different realms are needed to help stakeholders make better informed
   decision. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Geotechnical earthquake engineering in the recent times has been paying
   special attention to themes such as liquefaction of sand with
   cohesionless fines, performance-based design, and seismic mitigation
   measures for housing areas. Because recent earthquakes in Japan and New
   Zealand caused many liquefaction problems in residential zones, the
   above-mentioned issues have become even more important than before. The
   present study conducted laboratory tests on sand with cohesionless fines
   in order to show how the seismic performance of loose subsoil is
   assessed, thus developing a practical methodology of performance-based
   mitigations. Most experimental data obtained is presented together with
   interpretations, and the mathematical framework for the performance
   assessment is described together with an example of specified mitigation
   methods. It is worth mentioning that the target of this assessment is
   the residential land of people who cannot afford high costs of testing
   and analysis, therefore, the methodology is simplified as much as

Abstract = {{Bioavailability is a critical feature in the assessment of the role of
   micronutrients in human health. Poorly bioavailable micronutrients like
   carotenoids may reach significant concentrations in the gastrointestinal
   tract where they may exert biological actions.
   We evaluated a simple collection protocol to determine vitamin A, E and
   carotenoids in microsamples of human faeces as a non-invasive approach
   for nutritional studies.
   Microsamples of human faeces were collected using a commercially
   available device, extracted and analysed on two LC systems. Suitability
   of the protocol was assessed by evaluating several factors including the
   effect of simulated colonic conditions and two nutritional scenarios
   with different dietary components, chemical forms, nutritional goals and
   target groups.
   The protocol was reproducible and representative of a faeces sample. The
   major dietary and serum carotenoids, and several ``unidentified{''}
   compounds (possibly metabolites) could be detected, and
   cis-/trans-beta-carotene profile reflected dietary intervention. In
   faeces of neonates, free retinol, retinyl and alpha-tocopheryl acetate
   (from infant formula), long-chain fatty acid retinyl esters (from human
   milk), free gamma-tocopherol and alpha-tocopherol could be detected.
   Our results show that the analysis of vitamin A, E and carotenoids in
   microsamples of human faeces is a suitable, non-invasive approach that
   may provide relevant information regarding responsiveness, nutrient
   stability and metabolism and may help assess adequacy of chemical forms
   and delivery systems reaching the colon.}},

Abstract = {{A gall is the result of complex interactions between a gall
   inducing-insect and its host plant. Certain groups of insects have the
   ability to induce a new structure, a gall, on plant organs by altering
   the normal growth of the host involved plant organ. The gall usually
   provides shelter and nutrients, in addition to protection against
   adverse environmental conditions and natural enemies to the inducing
   insect and its offspring. The ecological uniqueness of a gall is that it
   allows the inducing-insect to complete their life cycles. In this study,
   we have described the structures of different stages of growth of a gall
   induced by Amphibolips michoacaensis on the buds of leaves on Quercus
   castanea (Fagaceae) to know the subcellular changes during development.
   The gall consist of various layers such as a nutritive tissue, a
   lignified sheath, a spongy layer and an outermost epidermis around a
   centrally located larval chamber. The nutritive cell of the larval
   chamber show nuclear and nucleolar hypertrophy in the early phases of
   growth. The granular profile of the nucleolus suggests an active
   synthesis of ribosomes indicating an accelerated protein synthesis in
   these cells. During early stages of growth. the cells of the spongy
   layers within galls are nucleate and nucleolate and include amyloplasts,
   and the cytoplasm is less abundant. During later growth stages, the
   spongy cells are enucleate and enucleolate. Chloroplasts occur in the
   epidermal cells during early stages of growth, indicating that galls are
   photosynthetically active in early stages of growth. During intermediate
   stages of growth, a gradual loss of cellular components occurs
   commencing in the epidermal cells and progressing towards the nutritive
   cells.}},

Title = {{Comparative proteomic analysis of compartmentalised Ras signalling}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Ras proteins are membrane bound signalling hubs that operate from both
   the cell surface and endomembrane compartments. However, the extent to
   which intracellular pools of Ras can contribute to cell signalling is
   debated. To address this, we have performed a global screen of
   compartmentalised Ras signalling. We find that whilst ER/Golgi- and
   endosomal-Ras only generate weak outputs, Ras localised to the
   mitochondria or Golgi significantly and distinctly influence both the
   abundance and phosphorylation of a wide range of proteins analysed. Our
   data reveal that similar to 80\% of phosphosites exhibiting large (>=
   1.5-fold) changes compared to control can be modulated by organellar Ras
   signalling. The majority of compartmentalised Ras-specific responses are
   predicted to influence gene expression, RNA splicing and cell
   proliferation. Our analysis reinforces the concept that
   compartmentalisation influences Ras signalling and provides detailed
   insight into the widespread modulation of responses downstream of
   endomembranous Ras signalling.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of 5 of the 6 WHO MPOWER program in Iran is
   satisfactory; the only notable shortcoming is the lack of tobacco
   taxation increases.
   This study was designed to increase key policy makers awareness of
   tobacco taxation effectiveness through a sensitization program in Iran.
   This analytical and semi-experimental study in 2014 included 110 tobacco
   control key policy makers, who were trained and received educational
   materials on the importance of tobacco taxation. A valid and reliable
   questionnaire was completed before and three months after intervention.
   Data were analyzed using mean (SD), t-Test and analysis of variance.
   The mean (SD) scores at pre- and post-test were 2.7 +/- 3 and 8.8 +/- 1
   out of 10, respectively. Paired t-tests demonstrated a significant
   difference in the pre- post-test knowledge scores.
   Increasing knowledge and promoting favorable attitudes of policy makers
   can lead to greater attention which could in turn change tobacco
   taxation policies.}},

Abstract = {{We examine smallholder participation in horticultural markets in Zambia,
   with two main questions in mind: 1) who participates in horticultural
   markets? and 2) how does participation affect household income and other
   welfare outcomes? To control for self-selection bias in the estimation
   of impacts, we used an endogenous switching framework on nationwide
   representative data over two agricultural seasons pooled, but
   controlling for district-level fixed effects. We found that
   participation is associated with labour availability, farm size, lagged
   productive assets, social capital through blood kinship links to the
   chief or headman, level of community participation in the government's
   input subsidy programme, and high rainfall variability measured by its
   coefficient of variation. Participation significantly increased income
   by 285\% overall, increasing to over 300\% for female-headed households,
   those cultivating less than one hectare and the extremely poor. These
   findings provide an empirical foundation to support Zambian
   policy-makers' crop-diversification and poverty-reduction agricultural
   policy objectives.}},

Title = {{Effect of 100 Hz electroacupuncture on salivary immunoglobulin A and the

Journal = {{ACUPUNCTURE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{451-456}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background A previous study has reported that low-frequency (LF)
   electroacupuncture (EA) influences salivary secretory immunoglobulin A
   (sIgA) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS is known to
   control the secretion volume of sIgA; however, the effect of
   high-frequency (HF) EA on salivary sIgA has not been determined. We
   investigated whether HF EA affects salivary sIgA levels and the ANS.
   Method Sixteen healthy subjects were randomly classified into two
   groups: a control group and an EA group. After a 5 min rest, subjects in
   the EA group received EA at 100 Hz bilaterally at LI4 and LI11 for 15
   min before resting for a further 40 min post-stimulation. Subjects in
   the control group rested for a total of 60 min.
   Measurements of the ANS and sIgA levels in both groups were made before,
   immediately after, 20 min after, and 40 min after rest or 15 min EA
   treatment. HF and LF components of heart rate variability were analysed
   as markers of ANS function. LF/HF ratio and HF were taken as indices of
   sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity, respectively. Salivary
   protein concentrations and sIgA levels were determined by Bradford
   protein assay and ELISA, respectively.
   Results LF/HF ratio was significantly increased immediately after EA. HF
   was significantly increased at 20 min after EA and sIgA level was
   significantly increased at 40 min after EA. In addition, HF and salivary
   sIgA level were positively correlated with each another.
   Conclusions HF EA exerted sequential positive effects on sympathetic
   nerve activity, parasympathetic nerve activity, and salivary sIgA level
   (immediately and after 20 and 40 min, respectively). HF EA may increase
   salivary sIgA levels by influencing parasympathetic nerve activity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To first provide an overview of studies that explore mental
   health disclosure in the workplace; including factors that influence the
   decision to disclose, and differing approaches to disclosure (binary,
   multidimensional, and evolving and ongoing). Second, to provide a
   critical overview of existing tools designed to help clients manage
   their mental health disclosure decisions. Method: Electronic searches of
   PubMed, PsycINFO and ScienceDirect were undertaken, excluding all
   articles published prior to 1990. The following search terms were used:
   mental health disclosure, employment, severe and persistent mental
   illness, psychosis, schizophrenia, supported employment, individual
   placement and support (IPS). Results: We found that mental health
   disclosure involves a complex decision-making process, and yet clients
   of IPS supported employment are currently provided with little
   structured guidance on how to manage their personal information in the
   workplace. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: More extensive
   investigations are required of existing mental health disclosure tools
   before they can be developed into a standardized intervention for
   practitioners. However, preliminary evidence suggests that facilitating
   better disclosure decisions and management of personal information is a
   promising area of future research. This line of investigation is likely
   to find ways to enhance competitive employment outcomes in supported
   employment for people with severe and persistent mental illness.}},

Abstract = {{Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare but life-threatening
   side effect of heparin therapy. It is a demanding therapeutic challenge
   in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
   implantation. We present our experience with LVAD implantation under
   extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in patients suffering from HIT. Seven
   patients (mean age 54.0 +/- A 16.7 years, 1 female, 6 male patients)
   suffering from acute heart failure were stabilized with ECLS. Under
   heparin therapy, they all showed a sudden decrease of mean platelet
   count (maximum 212.6 +/- A 41.5 tsd/mu l; minimum 30.7 +/- A 13.1 tsd/mu
   l). Due to the clinical suspicion of HIT anticoagulation was switched
   from heparin to argatroban (aPTT 70-80 s.). No improvement of cardiac
   function could be detected under ECLS, so LVAD implantation was
   indicated. We performed LVAD implantation under ECLS. During LVAD
   implantation under argatroban (aPTT of 50-60 s.) one patient developed
   massive intraventricular thrombus formations, so the device had to be
   removed. In 6 cases, we could successfully perform LVAD implantation
   under argatroban with a higher aPTT of 70-80 s and modified operative
   strategy. Four patients needed postoperative re-exploration because of
   bleeding complications. Perioperative management of LVAD patients under
   argatroban anticoagulation is very difficult. We were able to minimize
   the perioperative risk for thrombosis with a target aPTT of 70-80 s. To
   keep the phase of stasis within the device as short as possible we
   anastomosed the VAD outflow graft to the ascending aorta first before
   connecting the device to the apex. However, postoperative bleeding
   complications are frequent.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated atmospheric CO2 generally enhances plant growth, but the
   magnitude of the effects depend, in part, on nutrient availability and
   plant photosynthetic pathway. Due to their pivotal role in nutrient
   cycling, changes in abundance of detritivores could influence the
   effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on essential ecosystem processes,
   such as decomposition and primary production. We conducted a field
   survey and a microcosm experiment to test the influence of changes in
   detritus-based food chains on litter mass loss and plant growth response
   to elevated atmospheric CO2 using two wetland plants: a C-3 sedge
   (Scirpus olneyi) and a C-4 grass (Spartina patens). Our field study
   revealed that organism's sensitivity to climate increased with trophic
   level resulting in strong inter-annual variation in detritus-based food
   chain length. Our microcosm experiment demonstrated that increased
   detritivore abundance could not only enhance decomposition rates, but
   also enhance plant growth of S.olneyi in elevated atmospheric CO2
   conditions. In contrast, we found no evidence that changes in the
   detritus-based food chains influenced the growth of S.patens. Considered
   together, these results emphasize the importance of approaches that
   unite traditionally subdivided food web compartments and plant
   physiological processes to understand inter-annual variation in plant
   production response to elevated atmospheric CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Yeasts are unicellular fungi that do not form fruiting bodies. Although
   the yeast lifestyle has evolved multiple times, most known species
   belong to the subphylum Saccharomycotina (syn. Hemiascomycota, hereafter
   yeasts). This diverse group includes the premier eukaryotic model
   system, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; the common human commensal and
   opportunistic pathogen, Candida albicans; and over 1000 other known
   species (with more continuing to be discovered). Yeasts are found in
   every biome and continent and are more genetically diverse than
   angiosperms or chordates. Ease of culture, simple life cycles, and small
   genomes (similar to 10-20 Mbp) have made yeasts exceptional models for
   molecular genetics, biotechnology, and evolutionary genomics. Here we
   discuss recent developments in understanding the genomic underpinnings
   of the making of yeast biodiversity, comparing and contrasting natural
   and human-associated evolutionary processes. Only a tiny fraction of
   yeast biodiversity and metabolic capabilities has been tapped by
   industry and science. Expanding the taxonomic breadth of deep genomic
   investigations will further illuminate how genome function evolves to
   encode their diverse metabolisms and ecologies.}},

Abstract = {{Designers often use scenarios to approach complex design problems
   holistically. Efficient use of scenarios can be a challenge in complex
   dynamic user contexts due to mediation and tool limitations that use
   traditional scenario techniques in design practice. We investigate the
   use of real-time 3D game engines on the part of interaction/product
   designer-researchers as a design tool to conceptualise and simulate
   possible future shared user scenarios in the maritime domain. Three
   exploratory and qualitative case studies are presented, drawing on
   collaborative and participatory design, action research, and research
   through design. Results reveal that real-time 3D game engines can
   simulate multiple complex behaviours that otherwise would have been
   impossible to materialize with traditional visual scenario or
   storytelling methods. This opens up new possibilities for how designers
   can handle complex user relations and related risk factors when
   designing. For the maritime sector this has further potential for the
   handling of safety critical operations.}},

Title = {{Effect of feeding on the pharmacokinetics of oral minocycline in healthy

Journal = {{VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{399+}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundThe effect of food on minocycline oral absorption in dogs is
   unknown.
   ObjectiveThe objective was to determine the pharmacokinetics of
   minocycline after administration of a single oral dose in fed and fasted
   dogs.
   MethodsTen research hounds were administered oral minocycline
   (approximately 5mg/kg) with and without food, in a crossover study, with
   a one-week wash-out between treatments. Blood samples were collected
   immediately prior to minocycline administration and over 24h.
   Minocycline plasma drug concentrations were measured using
   high-performance liquid chromatography using ultraviolet detection and
   were analysed with compartmental modelling to determine primary
   pharmacokinetic parameters. Each dog was analysed independently,
   followed by calculation of means and variation of the dogs. The Wilcoxon
   signed-rank test {[}analysing secondary pharmacokinetic parameters -
   peak concentration (C-MAX), area under the concentration versus time
   curve (AUC)] was used to compare the two groups. A population
   pharmacokinetic modelling approach was performed using nonlinear mixed
   effects modelling of primary parameters for the population as fixed
   effects and the difference between subjects as a random effect.
   Covariate analysis was used to identify the source of variability in the
   population.
   ResultsNo significant difference was found between treatments for AUC
   (P=0.0645), although AUC was higher in fasted dogs. A significant
   difference was found for C-MAX (P=0.0059), with fasted dogs attaining a
   higher C-MAX. The covariate of fed versus fasted accounted for a
   significant variation in the pharmacokinetics.
   Conclusions and clinical importanceBecause feeding was a significant
   source of variation for the population's primary pharmacokinetic
   parameters and fasted dogs had higher minocycline concentrations, we
   recommend administering minocycline without food.

   ContexteL'effet de l'alimentation sur l'absorption orale de minocycline
   chez le chien n'est pas connu.
   Hypotheses/ObjectifsL'objectif etait de determiner la pharmacocinetique
   de la minocycline apres administration d'une dose orale unique chez des
   chiens nourris ou a jeun.
   MethodesDix chiens de chasse de recherche ont recu une dose orale de
   minocycline (environ 5mg/kg) avec ou sans nourriture, dans une etude
   croisee, avec une periode de blanc d'une semaine entre les traitements.
   Des echantillons sanguins ont ete collectes juste apres l'administration
   de minocycline et pendant 24 heures. Les concentrations plasmatiques de
   minocycline ont ete mesurees par chromatographie liquide a haute
   performance avec detection UV et ont ete analysees par modelisation
   compartimentale pour determiner les parametres pharmacocinetiques
   primaires. Chaque chien a ete analyse independamment, suivi du calcul
   des moyennes et des variations des chiens. Un test de Wilcoxon
   signed-rank test (analyse des parametres pharmacocinetiques secondaires
   - concentration maximale {[}C-MAX], aire sous la courbe concentration vs
   temps {[}AUC]) a ete utilise pour comparer les deux groupes. Une
   modelisation pharmacocinetique de la population a l'aide d'effets mixtes
   non-lineaires, la modelisation des parametres primaires pour la
   population des effets fixes et les differences entre sujets comme
   effetaleatoire, a ete realise. Une analyse de covariance a ete utilisee
   pour identifier la source de variabilite au sein de la population.
   ResultatsAucune difference significative n'a ete trouvee entre les
   traitements pour AUC (P=0.0645), bien que l'AUC ait ete plus elevee chez
   les chiens a jeun. Une difference significative a ete trouvee pour C-MAX
   (P=0.0059), avec les chiens a jeun atteignant un score plus eleve. La
   covariance de l'alimentation par rapport au jeune a represente un
   changement significatif dans la pharmacocinetique.
   Conclusions et importance cliniqueL'alimentation ayant ete une source
   importante de variation des parametres primaires cinetiques et les
   chiens a jeun ayant des concentrations de minocycline plus eleves, nous
   recommandons une administration de la minocycline sans aliment.
   Resumen
   Introduccionse desconoce el efecto de la comida en la absorcion oral de
   la minociclina en perros.
   Hipotesis/Objetivosel objetivo fue determinar la farmacocinetica de
   minociclina tras la administracion de una unica dosis oral en perros en
   ayunas o alimentados.
   Metodosa 10 perros de caza de investigacion se les administro
   minociclina por via oral (aproximadamente 5mg/kg) con y sin comida, en
   un estudio cruzado, con un periodo de una semana de lavado entre
   tratamientos. Las muestras de sangre fueron tomadas inmediatamente antes
   de la administracion de la minociclina y durante 24 horas. Las
   concentraciones de minociclina en plasma fueron medidas utilizando
   cromatografia liquida de alta precision utilizando deteccion
   ultravioleta y fueron analizadas mediante un modelo compartimentado para
   determinar los parametros primarios farmacocineticos. Cada perro fue
   analizado independientemente, seguido por un calculo de medias y
   variacion en los perros. La prueba del rango senal de Wilcoxon
   (analizando parametros farmacocineticos secundarios-concentracion pico
   {[}C-MAX], area bajo la curva concentracion-vs-tiempo {[}AUC]) fue
   utilizado para comparar los dos grupos. Se realizo una aproximacion de
   modelo de farmacocinetica de poblacion utilizando efectos no lineales
   mixtos para los parametros primarios de la poblacion como efectos fijos
   y la diferencia entre los sujetos como efecto al azar. Se utilizo un
   analisis de covarianza para identificar la fuente de variabilidad en la
   poblacion
   Resultadosno hubo diferencias significativas entre tratamientos para la
   AUC (P=0,0645), aunque la AUC fue mayor en perros en ayunas. Hubo una
   diferencia significativa para la C-MAX (P=0,0059), con perros en ayunas
   obteniendo una mayor C-MAX. La covarianza de perros alimentados versus
   perros en ayunas fue causante de una variacion significativa en la
   farmacocinetica.
   Conclusiones e importancia clinicaya que la alimentacion es una fuente
   de variacion significativa para los parametros primarios
   farmacocineticos y los perros en ayunas obtuvieron una mayor
   concentracion de minociclina, se recomienda la administracion de
   minociclina sin alimentos.
   Zusammenfassung
   HintergrundDer Einfluss von Futter auf die orale Absorption von
   Minocyclin ist bei Hunden unbekannt.
   Hypothese/ZieleDas Ziel war es die Pharmakokinetik von Minocyclin nach
   der Verabreichung einer einzigen Dosis per os bei gefutterten und
   gefasteten Hunden zu ermitteln.
   MethodenIn einer Cross-over Studie mit einer einwochigen Wash-out
   Periode wurde zehn Versuchshunden Minocyclin per os (ungefahr 5mg/kg)
   mit und ohne Futter verabreicht. Blutproben wurden unmittelbar vor der
   Minocyclin Verabreichung und uber eine Periode von 24 Stunden genommen.
   Es wurden Plasma Minocyclin Wirkstoffkonzentrationen mittels
   Hochleistungsflussigkeitschromatografie unter Verwendung von UV
   Detektion gemessen und mittels Kompartmentmodelling analysiert, gefolgt
   von einer Kalkulation der Durchschnitte und der Variationen bei den
   Hunden. Wilcoxon-Vorzeichen-Rangtest (welcher sekundare
   pharmakokinetische Parameter analysiert) - maximale
   Plasmakonzentrationen {[}C-max], die Flache unter der
   Konzentrations/Zeit-Kurve {[}AUC] wurde verwendet, um die beiden Gruppen
   zu vergleichen. Der Zugang mittels pharmakokinetischem Modelling fur die
   Population, welcher nichtlineare gemischte Modellingeffekte fur
   Primarparameter fur die Population als fixe Effekte verwendet und der
   Unterschied zwischen den Subjekten mittels Zufallseffekt ermittelt,
   wurde durchgefuhrt. Die Kovarianzanalyse wurde verwendet, um die Quelle
   der Variabilitat in der Population zu identifizieren.
   ErgebnisseEs wurden keine signifikanten Unterschiede zwischen den
   Behandlungen fur AUC (P=0,0645) gefunden, obwohl AUC bei den gefasteten
   Hunden hoher war. Ein signifikanter Unterschied wurde fur C-max gefunden
   (P=0,0059), wobei gefastete Hunde eine hohere C-max erreichten. Die
   Covariante von Futtern versus Fasten zeigte eine signifikante Variation
   in der Pharmakokinetik.
   Schlussfolgerungen und klinische BedeutungDa das Futtern eine
   signifikante Quelle der Variation fur die Primarparameter der Population
   darstellt und gefastete Hunde hohere Minocyclinkonzentrationen
   aufwiesen, empfehlen wir Minocyclin ohne Futter zu verabreichen.}},

Abstract = {{Since introduced by K. Atanassov as a generalization of fuzzy sets,
   intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) have been investigated by many
   researchers and applied in many different areas, e.g. for solving
   multi-attribute group decision-making. It is important to find an
   appropriately reliable measure in order to differentiate IFSs in
   comparison or ranking order. Although there exist several measures, many
   unreasonable cases can be made by such measures. This paper introduces a
   new measure of amount of knowledge related to information provided in
   terms of IFSs. The new measure takes into account relationship between
   membership and non-membership degrees and hesitancy for a lack of
   information, making it capable to measure both degree of fuzziness and
   intuitionism of IFSs simultaneously. First we present a new knowledge
   measure for IFSs and prove some properties of the proposed measure.
   Based on the proposed knowledge measure we construct a new entropy
   measure for IFSs, a new similarity measure between IFSs and prove some
   properties of them. Then we use some examples to illustrate that the
   proposed measures, though simple in concept and calculus, can overcome

Title = {{Much of the `economics of property rights' devalues property and legal
   rights}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{683-709}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Legal theorists and other commentators have long established a
   distinction between property and possession. According to this usage
   adopted here, possession refers to control of a resource, but property
   involves legally sanctioned rights. Strikingly, prominent foundational
   accounts of the `economics of property rights' concentrate on
   possession, downplaying the issue of legitimate legal rights (Alchian,
   1965, 1977; Barzel, 1994, 1997, 2002; von Mises, 1981). Some authors in
   this genre make a distinction between `economic rights' and `legal
   rights' where the former are more to do with possession or the capacity
   to control. They argue that `economic rights' are primary and more
   relevant for understanding behaviour. But it is argued here that legal
   factors - involving recognition of authority and perceived justice or
   morality - have also to be brought into the picture to understand human
   motivation in modern societies, even in the economic sphere. As other
   authors including Hernando De Soto (2000) have pointed out, the neglect
   of the legal infrastructure that buttresses property has deleterious
   implications, including a failure to understand the role of property in
   supporting collateralized loans for innovation and economic development.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This is a response to the useful comments by Allen, Barzel and Cole on
   Hodgson (2015a) on property rights. One section deals with some
   misrepresentations by Allen and Barzel. For instance, contrary to one
   interpretation, Hodgson (2015a) did not accuse the `economics of
   property rights' of ignoring legal institutions or of making them
   generally irrelevant. This response further clarifies the standard
   meaning of rights, showing that it is at variance with usages in the
   `economics of property rights'. The issue of moral motivation, and its
   relevance for legal compliance, are also elaborated. Some arguments in
   Hodgson (2015a) have been described by critics as mere semantics, but in
   response it is argued - contrary to philosophical nominalism - that
   changes in the meanings of words can be analytically significant, and we
   should treat traditional meanings more seriously, especially when
   dealing with other disciplines such as law. (The cryptic reference to
   Humpty Dumpty comes in here). Before concluding, there is also a brief
   discussion of different ways of interpreting transaction costs.}},

Abstract = {{A contemporary focus on democratic decision-making has occurred in
   school science through curricular developments such as socioscientific
   issues (SSIs) and Science, Technology, Society and Environment (STSE),

   appears these components are often taught, if at all, as simply add-on
   content. Private schools represent a domain of education that has
   received relatively little attention in research literature regarding
   sociopolitical activism for addressing SSIs. In this study, we aimed to
   document the extent to which private school students were able to
   implement socioscientific activism and to map their socio-political
   development in the context of a project on child labour. Data collected
   from student projects and interviews indicate, in many cases, dramatic
   development of socially critical views and activist orientations that
   took place over time, and in various steps. A discussion of the factors
   enabling students' activist development, such as the school culture, the
   curriculum, and their teacher, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The applicability of immune responses in transplanted Baltic blue
   mussels (Mytilus trossulus) as biomarkers of immunotoxic effects was
   studied at differently contaminated locations in the Gulf of Bothnia
   (northern Baltic Sea). Here, we present a detailed report on the immune
   responses measured as complementary part of transplantation study by
   Tuna et al. (2014).
   Various immunological endpoints such as total and differential cell
   count, morphological alterations, phagocytic activity, and caspase 3/7
   activity of mussel haemocytes as well as haemolytic activity of the
   haemolymph were used. Mussels collected at a reference site at a Finnish
   coastal site (Hanko, H) were transplanted at the Swedish coast near
   industrial and urban regions of the cities Sundsvall (S1, S2) and Gavle
   (G1, G2), respectively. Based on the measured immunological responses,
   multivariate statistical analysis (PCA biplot) showed a clear separation
   of the most polluted site Si, indicating immunotoxic impacts of the
   mixture of contaminants present at this location. Based on these
   observations and results from Tuna et al. (2014), we suggest the
   implementation of immunotoxic biomarkers for the evaluation of ecosystem
   health. However, these should be accompanied by complementary endpoints
   of biological effects encompassing i.e., physiological, antioxidant and
   bioenergetic markers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An under-explored intermediate position between traditional materialism
   and traditional idealism is the view that although the spatiotemporal
   world is purely material, minds nonetheless have a metaphysically
   special place in it. One way this can be is via a special role that
   subjects have in the metaphysics of material objects. Some metaphysical
   aspect of material objects might require the existence of subjects. This
   would support that minds must exist if material objects exist and thus
   that a mindless material world is impossible. This view, labeled the
   subjectivity thesis by Anton Friedrich Koch, was defended by him with an
   intriguing, purely metaphysical argument connected to the individuation
   of material objects in space and time. The present paper hopes to make
   progress on assessing the viability of such a position. It starts by
   critically examining Koch's argument for the subjectivity thesis, as
   well as similar arguments that give minds a central place in the
   metaphysics of material objects via considerations about identity and
   difference. It then compares these ideas to similar ones in the
   philosophy of time, and concludes with an outlook on whether such a
   position is viable and what needs to be done to fill the gaps unearthed
   along the way.}},

Title = {{Carpal and scaphoid fracture incidence in south-eastern Australia: an
   epidemiologic study}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF OSTEOPOROSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Carpal fractures were identified by the Geelong Osteoporosis Study
   Fracture Grid for 2006-2007. Incidence rates were higher in males than
   females. Males had a lower median age of fracture than females. Females
   had more fractures on the left side than males. Most fractures were the
   result of a fall.
   Purpose In this study, we report the incidence of carpal bone fractures
   (scaphoid and non-scaphoid) amongst residents from the Barwon
   Statistical Division over 2 years.
   Methods X-ray reports from imaging centres in the region were used to
   identify incident fractures during 2006 and 2007. Data were collected as
   part of the Geelong Osteoporosis Study Fracture Grid.
   Results During 2006 and 2007, there were 171 and 41 carpal fractures in
   males and females, respectively. Of these, 131 males and 29 females had
   fractured the scaphoid bone. Females had a higher proportion of
   left-sided fractures (>70 \%) than males (similar to 40 \%). Most
   fractures were the result of an accidental fall (>87 \%). Patterns of
   incidence for males showed one major peak around 20-29 years. For
   females, peaks occurred around age 10-19 years and 70-79 years.
   Incidence rates for males (per 100,000 persons per year) were 54.6 (95
   \% confidence interval (CI) 53.6, 55.7) and 15.9 (95 \% CI 15.4, 16.5)
   for scaphoid and non-scaphoid fractures, respectively. In females, the
   corresponding rates were 10.6 (95 \% CI 10.2, 11.1) and 4.5 (95 \% CI
   4.2, 4.8).
   Conclusion Almost all fractures were the result of a fall. In males,
   carpal fractures were sustained mainly during early adulthood and in
   females during adolescence and after menopause. Incidence rates for
   males were higher than those in females for both scaphoid and
   non-scaphoid fractures.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Air pollution models are often used to support decisions in air quality
   management. Due to the complexity of the forecasting system and
   difficulty in acquiring precise enough input data, an environmental
   prognosis of air quality with an analytical model of the air pollution
   dispersion is burdened with a substantial share of uncertainty,
   especially as regards urban areas. To ignore the uncertainty in the
   modeling would lead to incorrect policy decisions, with further negative
   environmental and health consequences. This paper presents a case study
   which shows how emission uncertainty of air pollutants generated by the
   industry, traffic, and the municipal sector relates to concentrations
   measured at receptor points. The computational experiment was
   implemented in the Warsaw metropolitan area, Poland. The main source of
   this adverse environmental impact is the transportation system,
   including the transit traffic. The Monte Carlo technique was used for
   assessing the key uncertainty factors. Several types of pollution
   species that are characteristic for the urban atmospheric environment
   (e.g., PM10, PM2.5, NOx, SO2], Pb) were included in the analysis. The
   results show significant spatial variability of the modeled uncertainty.
   The reason of this variability is discussed in detail. It depends not
   only on the category of the emission source but also on the contributing
   emission sources and their quantity.}},

Journal = {{NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2070-2117}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally, rational-basis scrutiny is extremely deferential and
   rarely invalidates legislation under the Equal Protection Clause.
   However, a small number of Supreme Court cases, while purporting to
   apply rational-basis review, have held laws unconstitutional under a
   higher standard often termed ``rational basis with bite.{''} This Note
   analyzes every rational-basis-with-bite case from the 1971 through 2014
   Terms and nine factors that appear to recur throughout these cases. This
   Note argues that rational basis with bite is most strongly correlated
   with laws that classify on the basis of an immutable characteristic or
   burden a significant right. These two factors are particularly likely to
   be present in rational-basis-with-bite cases, which can be explained on
   both doctrinal and prudential grounds. This conclusion upends the
   conventional wisdom that animus is the critical factor in rational basis
   with bite and reveals that other routes to rational basis with bite
   exist. Finally, this Note observes that applying at least rational basis
   with bite to discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and
   transgender individuals is consistent with the pattern of cases
   implicating immutability and significant rights.}},

Journal = {{ECOSYSTEM SERVICES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{33-46}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Urbanisation is a key driver of land use change and urban growth is set
   to continue. The provision of ecosystem services depends on the
   existence of greenspace. Urban morphology is potentially an important
   influence on ecosystem services. Therefore, it may be possible to
   promote service provision through an urban structure that supplies the
   processes and functions that underpin them. However, an understanding of
   the ability of urban areas to produce multiple ecosystem services, and
   the spatial pattern of their production, is required. We demonstrate an
   approach using easily accessible data, to generate maps of key urban
   ecosystem services for a case study city of Sheffield, UK. Urban
   greenspace with a mixture of land covers allowed areas of high
   production of multiple services in the city centre and edges. But
   crucially the detection of such `hotspots' depended on the spatial
   resolution of the mapping unit. This shows there is potential to design
   cities to promote hotspots of production. We discuss how land cover
   type, its spatial location and how this relates to different suites of
   services, is key to promoting urban multifunctionality. Detecting
   trade-offs and synergies associated with particular urban designs will
   enable more informed decisions for achieving urban sustainability. (C)

Abstract = {{Lichens in montane, forested ecosystems of the Intermountain West and
   central Rocky Mountains tend to be understudied. Focusing on forested
   ecosystems in Utah, specifically Santaquin and Payson Canyons, we
   describe lichen community diversity and composition and their relation
   to percent aspen cover, and contrast lichens in aspen, non-aspen
   hardwood and coniferous environments. We collected 351 macrolichens, a
   total of 34 species and 15 genera, from 22 circular plots with a 34.7 m
   radius. We found three major gradients in lichen community composition
   in our study area. First, many species of Xanthomendoza had strong
   positive correlations with increasing aspen cover, while several
   Melanohalea species declined with greater aspen cover. Xanthomendoza
   galericulata was a significant indicator for aspen forests, but this
   lichen was not limited to aspen as it colonizes various barks flexibly.
   Second, corticolous and saxicolous taxa positively associated with a
   trend in lichen species richness, while terricolous lichens associated
   with the opposite end of this gradient. The third and weakest gradient
   was related to the cover of non-aspen hardwoods and the presence of
   fruticose species. Both lichen community composition and species
   richness differed significantly among aspen, non-aspen hardwood and
   conifer-dominated forests. In agreement with previous work in other
   regions, the non-aspen hardwood forests we sampled supported the most
   diverse and prolific lichen communities. Lichens of our aspen forests
   are as diverse as those in conifer-dominated forests, which contrasts
   with some current literature suggesting that aspen woodlands represent
   hotspots of diversity for many types of flora and fauna. Our finding
   that aspen-dwelling lichens markedly contrast with lichens on other
   substrates, including other hardwoods, contributes to our understanding
   of lichen community composition in arid, montane forests of the central
   Rocky Mountains.}},

Abstract = {{We present a forcing to obtain a localized version of Local Club
   Condensation, a generalized Condensation principle introduced by Sy
   Friedman and the first author in {[}3] and {[}5]. This forcing will have
   properties nicer than the forcings to obtain this localized version that
   could be derived from the forcings presented in either {[}3] or {[}5].
   We also strongly simplify the related proofs provided in {[}3] and
   {[}5]. Moreover our forcing will be capable of introducing this
   localized principle at kappa while simultaneously performing collapses
   to make kappa become the successor of any given smaller regular
   cardinal. This will be particularly useful when kappa has large cardinal
   properties in the ground model. We will apply this to measure how much
   L-likeness is implied by Local Club Condensation and related principles.
   We show that Local Club Condensation at kappa(+) is consistent with
   inverted left perpendicular square(kappa) whenever kappa is regular and
   uncountable, generalizing and improving a result of the third author in
   {[}14], and that if kappa >= omega(2) is regular, CC(kappa(+)) - Chang's
   Conjecture at kappa(+) - is consistent with Local Club Condensation at
   kappa(+), both under suitable large cardinal consistency assumptions.}},

   transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures. The LOP
   represents all possible angiographic angulations that result in an
   orthogonal view to the aortic annulus plane. The IVs allow visual
   confirmation of correct implantation planes, and are crucial for the
   commissural aligned implantation of second-generation TAVI prostheses.
   METHODS: The LOP and IVs of 335 concomitant patients were prospectively
   analysed using multiple plane reconstruction (MPR) of the patient's MSCT
   scans. Exclusion criteria were bicuspid valves (n = 18) and
   valve-in-valve TAVI (n = 15). In the MPRs, the aortic cusps' lowest
   points were marked. With the marker's three-dimensional coordinates, the
   graph of the LOP with the IVs was calculated and plotted using vector
   mathematics. In the last 244 cases, the IV with the right coronary cusp
   in front was chosen for the first aortic root angiogram of the TAVI
   procedure. The finally used angulation was confirmed by aortic angiogram
   prior to the valve implantation. Solid angle differences that show the
   combined left anterior oblique/right anterior oblique and cranio/caudal
   movement of the C-arm allow quantification of corrections as well as
   demonstrate interindividual variations.
   RESULTS: There is a broad interindividual variation of the aortic
   valve's topology with solid angle variations of up to 74 degrees. The
   shape of the LOPs is extremely varying, especially regarding the slope
   of the curve that indicates differences in valve orientations. Among the
   244 patients for whom we used the prediction for the procedure, the
   first angiogram was considered perfect for implantation without further
   corrections in 97\% (n = 237) of them. In case of the 7 patients with
   subsequent corrections, the mean solid angle between the prediction and
   the final angiogram prior to implantation was 6.2 degrees (+/- 5
   degrees); the largest correction was 14 degrees.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prediction of the implantation plane by analysing the
   patient's MSCT is highly reliable in achieving an adequate view of the
   aortic annulus in TAVI. The analysis of LOPs showed the large
   interindividual differences that permit using a standard implantation
   plane. Therefore, we strongly recommend determining the LOP and IVs
   during the patient's screening process in each single TAVI case.}},

Abstract = {{Methodological variations in the amount of sample incubated and the type
   of rumen fluid used are commonly observed. This study evaluated the
   effect of three sample amounts (0.6, 1.3 or 2.6g DM 100mL(-1) of rumen
   fluid) incubated in rumen fluid buffered (BRF-buffered rumen fluid) or
   not (PRF-pure rumen fluid) on total gas volume (TV), methane (CH4)
   production, dry matter degradation (DM Deg) and final pH of corn silage
   incubated in vitro. The highest DM Deg was reached with the lowest
   amounts of sample (0.6 and 1.3g of DM 100mL(-1) of rumen fluid). The
   sample amount of 2.6g associated with PRF reduced CH4 production
   (P<0.05), compared with the amounts of 0.6 and 1.3g DM 100mL(-1), which
   had similar CH4 production (P>0.05). The use of BRF caused no effect on
   CH4 production (P>0.05), independent of the sample amount. Increasing
   the amount of substrate resulted in lower final pH of incubation in both
   fluids (P<0.05). Our results indicate that incubations should be
   performed with the smallest amount of sample (0.6g of DM 100mL(-1) of
   rumen fluid), using fluid without buffer. Incubation without buffer
   solution overestimates the CH4 production of corn silage. Further
   studies should be conducted to verify the possibility of in vitro
   ruminal incubation of other ingredients using pure rumen fluid.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The routine measurement of IgA anticardiolipin (aCL) and IgA
   anti-beta(2) glycoprotein I (anti-beta(2) GPI) antibodies remain
   controversial despite several studies demonstrating an association with
   thromboembolic disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus
   (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This controversy may be a
   contributing factor for the current under use of IgA antiphospholipid
   antibodies. We aimed to investigate the nature of discrepant IgA
   anti-beta(2) GPI reactivity to help define the diagnostic value of IgA
   antiphospholipid antibodies.
   Material and Methods: Four sera selected from SLE/APS patients and
   positive for antiphospholipid antibodies but having discrepant IgA
   anti-beta(2) GPI reactivity on two commercial assays were studied. IgA
   antibodies were affinity purified to investigate anti-beta(2) GPI
   reactivity. Column wash through and eluent fractions were tested on both
   IgA anti-beta(2) GPI assays. Results were normalized to total protein.
   Assay conjugates and standards from the discrepant assays were
   interchanged.
   Results: The diseased samples were strongly positive in one assay
   {[}144-388 IgA antiphospholipid (APL) units] and negative or weakly
   positive in another assay (9.9-53 APL units). IgA eluents from IgA
   anti-beta(2) GPI positive samples reacted 10 times stronger on the
   reactive assay. When normalized to protein content, the eluents showed
   no cross-reactivity for IgG or IgM anti-beta(2) GPI antibodies,
   confirming IgA isotype specificity. Conjugate interchange confirmed that
   both assays bound IgA anti-beta(2) GPI antibodies, but the anti-IgA
   conjugate from the reactive assay was 4 times stronger, suggesting that
   its ability to detect IgA anti-beta(2) GPI antibodies was partially
   dependent on the anti-IgA conjugate and calibration.
   Conclusion: These results confirm not only the presence of IgA
   anti-beta(2) GPI antibodies in the selected patient samples but also
   highlight an IgA conjugate issue for the unreactive assay, causing an
   underestimation of IgA anti-beta(2) GPI. This finding may assist in the
   ongoing standardization efforts of APS antibody testing. In addition,
   conclusions from published clinical studies may need to be revised as
   some assays may understate IgA significance.}},

Abstract = {{To prevent falls, adjustment of foot placement is a frequently used
   strategy to regulate and restore gait stability. While foot trajectory
   adjustments have been studied during discrete stepping, online
   corrections during walking are more common in daily life. Here, we
   studied quick foot placement adjustments during gait, using an
   instrumented treadmill equipped with a projector, which allowed us to
   project virtual stepping stones. This allowed us to shift some of the
   approaching stepping stones in a chosen direction at a given moment,
   such that participants were forced to adapt their step in that specific
   direction and had varying time available to do so. Thirteen healthy
   participants performed six experimental trials all consisting of 580
   stepping stones, and 96 of those stones were shifted anterior, posterior
   or lateral at one out of four distances from the participant. Overall,
   long-step gait adjustments were performed more successfully than
   short-step and side-step gait adjustments. We showed that the ability to
   execute movement adjustments depends on the direction of the trajectory
   adjustment. Our findings suggest that choosing different leg movement
   adjustments for obstacle avoidance comes with different risks and that
   strategy choice does not depend exclusively on environmental
   constraints. The used obstacle avoidance strategy choice might be a
   trade-off between the environmental factors (i.e., the cost of a
   specific adjustment) and individuals' ability to execute a specific
   adjustment with success (i.e., the associated execution risk).}},

Title = {{Jaffrea, a new genus of Rhamnaceae endemic to New Caledonia, with notes
   on Alphitonia and Emmenosperma}},
Journal = {{KEW BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Molecular phylogenetic and morphological data show that two species of
   Rhamnaceae endemic to New Caledonia, Alphitonia xerocarpa and A.
   erubescens, are misplaced. They form a clade that is sister to
   Emmenosperma, and they differ from Alphitonia s.s. in their indumentum,
   venation, lower leaf surface, flowers, fruits and seeds. Although
   morphologically closer to Emmenosperma, both their flowers and fruits
   are distinct from those of Emmenosperma s.s., and so a new genus,
   Jaffrea H. C. Hopkins \& Pillon, is described to accommodate them, and
   the combinations Jaffrea xerocarpa (Baill.) H. C. Hopkins \& Pillon and
   Jaffrea erubescens (Baill.) H. C. Hopkins \& Pillon are published.
   Members of this new genus have a conical hypanthium, petals somewhat
   incurved at anthesis, a thick disc that is either +/- lumpy or annular
   but not or only partly covering the semi-inferior ovary, and fruits that
   are ovoid-ellipsoid, strongly beaked and tardily dehiscent. As in
   Emmenosperma and most species of Alphitonia, the seeds in Jaffrea can
   remain attached to the base of the fruit after most of the pericarp has
   fallen. Alphitonia is now represented in New Caledonia by a single
   species, A. neocaledonica, and its nomenclature and types are reviewed.
   The generic description of Alphitonia is amended to include the unique
   fruits of the New Guinean endemic A. macrocarpa, which are much larger
   than those of its congeners, strongly beaked, lacking a mealy endocarp,
   and with seeds that fall before the persistent valves. Relationships
   within Emmenosperma s.l., especially the affinities of E. papuanum and
   E. micropetalum, require further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{A group connectome of 20 subjects has been normalized into standard
   stereotactic (MNI) space. Data has been processed using the Gibbs'
   Tracking approach (Reisert et al., 2011) {[}11] and normalized into
   standard space using DARTEL (Ashburner, 2007) {[}1]. All data has been
   acquired within the scope of the study A Horn, D. Ostwald, M. Reisert,

   htip://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.201109.069. The utility of this
   dataset can be described by the following points: In medical studies in
   which subject-specific dMRI is not available, a standardized connectome
   may help to gain some canonical insight into white-matter connectivity.
   The dataset enables scientists who use different modalities (like EEG,
   MEG etc.) without access to MRI, to combine studies obtained using other
   methodology with insights from the brain's inner structural formation.
   The dataset could also extend possible claims made by
   meta-analyzes/literature-based studies. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{The mesa size effect on light extraction efficiency (LEE) of
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs) was studied in this work. The mesa area
   size of three kinds of LEDs that were evaluated include: 350 x 950 mu
   m(2) (small-size embedded electrodes: GaN LED, S-LED), 500 x 950 mu m(2)
   (medium-size embedded electrodes: GaN LED, M-LED), 950 x 950 mu m(2)
   (large-size embedded electrodes: GaN LED, L-LED). This paper not only
   discusses LEE, but current density and heat dissipation performance as
   well. The output power and light extraction efficiency at 700 mA/mm(2)
   for S-LED, M-LED, and L-LED are 555, 485, and 432 mW and 38.1\%, 33.4\%,
   and 29.7\%, respectively. The best output power and LEE of S-LED is due
   to the electron-hole recombination rate increasing. This phenomenon is
   caused by the greatest current spread and heat dissipation potential.}},

Title = {{Genetic Adaptation to Climate in White Spruce Involves Small to Moderate
   Allele Frequency Shifts in Functionally Diverse Genes}},
Journal = {{GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation to climate is of paramount
   importance for preserving and managing genetic diversity in plants in a
   context of climate change. Yet, this objective has been addressed mainly
   in short-lived model species. Thus, expanding knowledge to nonmodel
   species with contrasting life histories, such as forest trees, appears
   necessary. To uncover the genetic basis of adaptation to climate in the
   widely distributed boreal conifer white spruce (Picea glauca), an
   environmental association study was conducted using 11,085 single
   nucleotide polymorphisms representing 7,819 genes, that is,
   approximately a quarter of the transcriptome.
   Linear and quadratic regressions controlling for isolation-by-distance,
   and the Random Forest algorithm, identified several dozen genes
   putatively under selection, among which 43 showed strongest signals
   along temperature and precipitation gradients. Most of them were related
   to temperature. Small to moderate shifts in allele frequencies were
   observed. Genes involved encompassed a wide variety of functions and
   processes, some of them being likely important for plant survival under
   biotic and abiotic environmental stresses according to expression data.
   Literature mining and sequence comparison also highlighted conserved
   sequences and functions with angiosperm homologs.
   Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions that local
   adaptation involves genes with small frequency shifts when selection is
   recent and gene flow among populations is high. Accordingly, genetic
   adaptation to climate in P. glauca appears to be complex, involving many
   independent and interacting gene functions, biochemical pathways, and
   processes. From an applied perspective, these results shall lead to
   specific functional/association studies in conifers and to the
   development of markers useful for the conservation of genetic resources.}},

Abstract = {{New York University Abu Dhabi was inaugurated in 2010 with the express
   aim of producing global citizens, adept at crossing ethnic, national,
   and religious borders and exemplifying a certain kind of cosmopolitan
   ethic. This mission was tightly bound with the brand of cosmopolitanism
   articulated by Anthony Appiah and reflected most clearly in a core
   curriculum that emphasized cross-cultural and global inquiry. The desire
   to escape national paradigms was equally apparent in the distinctive
   curriculum of the history program, which was organized according to
   ocean systems and global patterns of transnational connection. Studied
   within this historical context, cities offer particular cognitive gains
   for students and researchers. As nodes of both imperial power and
   cosmopolitan ideals, cities complicate simple narratives of
   cross-cultural empathy and translatability. Despite its global
   connections, the contemporary city is confronted in its materiality as a
   sequence of boundaries and barriers. Within NYUAD as an institution,
   however, resistance to the core curriculum has emerged from other
   disciplines. The desire of the natural and social sciences for a
   ``global{''} that is ``universal{''} fits uneasily with the dream of a
   cosmopolitanism that leads to self-reflexivity in regard to one's own
   values. And students themselves wonder, who is the cosmopolitan here?}},

Abstract = {{The present paper describes the effect of magnetic pick-up coil transfer
   functions on mode number analysis in magnetically confined fusion
   plasmas. Magnetic probes mounted inside the vacuum chamber are widely
   used to characterize the mode structure of magnetohydrodynamic modes,
   as, due to their relative simplicity and compact nature, several coils
   can be distributed over the vessel. Phase differences between the
   transfer functions of different magnetic pick-up coils lead to
   systematic errors in time-and frequency resolved mode number analysis.
   This paper presents the first in situ, end-to-end calibration of a
   magnetic pick-up coil system which was carried out by using an in-vessel
   driving coil on ASDEX Upgrade. The effect of the phase differences in
   the pick-up coil transfer functions is most significant in the 50-250
   kHz frequency range, where the relative phase shift between the
   different probes can be up to 1 radian (similar to 60 degrees). By
   applying a correction based on the transfer functions we found smaller
   residuals of mode number fitting in the considered discharges. In most
   cases an order of magnitude improvement was observed in the residuals of
   the mode number fits, which could open the way to investigate weaker
   electromagnetic oscillations with even high mode numbers.}},

   between two or more time series. Such analysis is typically carried out
   by causality and/or independence tests which have been well studied when
   the data is univariate or multivariate. Modern data though is
   increasingly of a high dimensional or functional nature for which Finite
   dimensional methods are not suitable. In the present paper we develop
   methodology to check the assumption that data obtained from two
   functional time series are independent. Our procedure is based on the
   norms of empirical cross covariance operators and is asymptotically
   validated when the underlying populations are assumed to be in a class
   of weakly dependent random functions which include the functional ARMA,
   ARCH and GARCH processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Optimal Determination of Respiratory Airflow Patterns for a General

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a framework for determining optimal
   respiratory airflow patterns for a multicompartment lung mechanics
   system with nonlinear resistance and compliance parameters. First, a
   nonlinear multicompartment lung mechanics model that accounts for
   nonlinearities in both the airway resistances and the lung compliances
   is developed. In particular, we assume that the resistive losses are
   characterized by a Rohrer-type model with resistive losses defined as
   the sum of linear and quadratic terms of the airflow. The proposed model
   is more realistic than those presented in the literature, since it takes
   into account the heterogeneity of lung anatomy and function as well as
   the nonlinearity of lung resistance and compliance parameters. This
   model can be used to provide a better understanding of pulmonary
   function as well as the process of mechanical ventilation. Next, using
   the proposed nonlinear multicompartment lung model, we develop a
   framework for determining optimal respiratory airflow patterns.
   Specifically, an optimization criterion that involves the minimization
   of the oxygen consumption of the lung muscles and lung volume
   acceleration for the inspiratory phase, and the minimization of the
   elastic potential energy and rapid airflow rate changes for the
   expiratory phase is formulated and solved. The solution to the
   formulated optimization problem is derived using classical calculus of
   variation techniques. Finally, several illustrative numerical examples
   are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed nonlinear
   multicompartment lung model and the corresponding optimal airflow
   patterns. Comparison with experimental data shows that our nonlinear
   resistance model predicts the airflow patterns more accurately than
   linear resistance models. Moreover, the optimization criterion used in
   this paper also provides a more accurate prediction of the optimal
   airflow patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this retrospective investigation was to measure vertical bone
   thickness on the hard palate, determine areas with adequate bone for the
   insertion of orthodontic mini-implants (MIs), and provide clinical
   guidelines for identification of those areas.
   Pre-treatment records of 1007 patients were reviewed by a single
   examiner. A total of 125 records fulfilled the inclusion criteria and
   were further investigated. Bone measurements were performed on cone-beam
   computed tomography scans, at a 90A degrees angle to the bone surface,
   on 28 predetermined and standardized points on the hard palate. Bone
   thickness at various areas was associated to clinically identifiable
   areas on the hard palate by means of pre-treatment plaster models.
   Bone thickness ranged between 1.51 and 13.86mm (total thickness) and
   0.33 and 1.65mm (cortical bone thickness), respectively. Bone thickness
   was highest in the anterior palate and decreased significantly towards
   more posterior areas. Plaster model analysis revealed that bone
   thickness was highest at the level of the third palatal ruga.
   The areas on the anterior palate with adequate bone thickness for
   successful insertion of orthodontic MI correspond to the region of the
   third palatal ruga. These results provide stable and clinically
   identifiable landmarks for the insertion of palatal MIs.}},

Title = {{Testing the hypothesis of preferential attachment in social network

Journal = {{EPJ DATA SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The hypothesis of preferential attachment (PA) - whereby better
   connected individuals make more connections - is hotly debated,
   particularly in the context of epidemiological networks. The simplest
   models of PA, for example, are incompatible with the eradication of any
   disease through population-level control measures such as random
   vaccination. Typically, evidence has been sought for the presence or
   absence of preferential attachment via asymptotic power-law behaviour.
   Here, we present a general statistical method to test directly for
   evidence of PA in count data and apply this to data for contacts
   relevant to the spread of respiratory diseases. We find that while
   standard methods for model selection prefer a form of PA, careful
   analysis of the best fitting PA models allows for a level of contact
   heterogeneity that in fact allows control of respiratory diseases. Our
   approach is based on a flexible but numerically cheap likelihood-based
   model that could in principle be applied to other integer data where the
   hypothesis of PA is of interest.}},

Abstract = {{Sunflower is a diverse crop grown for oil or confectionary uses in the
   U.S. Southern High Plains, often under irrigation, but its water use,
   water productivity (water use efficiency) and crop coefficients for
   irrigation scheduling are not well known for the Texas High Plains. Crop
   water use (evapotranspiration or ET) was measured in 2009 and 2011 in
   two 4.4-ha fields using two precision 9 m(2) weighing lysimeters
   containing 2.3-m deep monoliths of Pullman clay loam soil. The fields
   were irrigated with a lateral move sprinkler system with nozzles about
   1.7-1.8 m above the ground and 1.5-m apart. The sunflower ET averaged
   638 mm; seed yields averaged 308 g m(-2); and the lysimeter crop water
   productivity averaged 0.49 kg (dry seed + hull) m(-3). Even in the 2011
   record drought season with limited soil water reserves, seed yield and
   oil content appeared similar to those for the 2009 season with greater
   precipitation and less irrigation requirement. Also, a month later
   sowing date in 2011, which might occur following an early cotton crop
   failure, did not appear to greatly affect ET, crop coefficients, or
   sunflower seed yields. The basal crop coefficients were 0.15 for the
   initial period after planting (K-cbini) and 1.22 for the peak water use
   rate at full cover (K-cbmid) based on the daily ASCE short ``grass{''}
   reference ET (ETos) and FAO 56 climate adjustment. The K-cbmid based on
   the ASCE taller, rougher ``alfalfa{''} Reference ET (ETrs) was 0.80.
   Using a thermal-time base (growing degree day) for the crop coefficient
   did not greatly improve the representation of the crop coefficient.
   Comparisons of ASCE reference ET computed using hourly versus daily
   summary data, and for short and tall reference crops, to each other and
   to FAO 56 reference ET showed that the relationships between reference
   ET methods varied significantly from one year to the next. This climate
   effect means that conversions of crop coefficients from one standard ET
   formulation to another will not be straightforward. Published by

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggest that quantifying donor-reactive memory T cells
   prior to kidney transplantation by interferon gamma enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent spot assay (IFNELISPOT) can assist in assessing risk of
   posttransplant allograft injury. Herein, we report an analysis of
   IFNELISPOT results from the multicenter, Clinical Trials in Organ
   Transplantation-01 observational study of primary kidney transplant
   recipients treated with heterogeneous immunosuppression. Within the
   subset of 176 subjects with available IFNELISPOT results, pretransplant
   IFNELISPOT positivity surprisingly did not correlate with either the
   incidence of acute rejection (AR) or estimated glomerular filtration
   rate (eGFR) at 6- or 12-month. These unanticipated results prompted us
   to examine potential effect modifiers, including the use of T
   cell-depleting, rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Within the no-ATG
   subset, IFNELISPOTneg subjects had higher 6- and 12-month eGFRs than
   IFNELISPOTpos subjects, independent of biopsy-proven AR, peak PRA, human
   leukocyte antigen mismatches, African-American race, donor source, and
   recipient age or gender. In contrast, IFNELISPOT status did not
   correlate with posttransplant eGFR in subjects given ATG. Our data
   confirm an association between pretransplant IFNELISPOT positivity and
   lower posttransplant eGFR, but only in patients who do not receive ATG
   induction. Controlled studies are needed to test the hypothesis that ATG
   induction is preferentially beneficial to transplant candidates with
   high frequencies of donor-reactive memory T cells.}},

Abstract = {{Post-disaster reconstruction relies on, and is shaped by, the good
   intentions of states, non-governmental organizations, and donors. These
   intentions, however, are inescapably framed by historical circumstances
   and cultural values. Consequently, post-disaster interventions can
   reinforce patterns of prejudice, injustice, and disadvantage that were
   entrenched in pre-disaster settings. Focusing on the experiences of
   Indigenous Rukai communities in southern Taiwan during recovery and
   reconstruction following Typhoon Morakot in 2009, this article explores
   the challenges faced in addressing Indigenous-specific concerns in
   post-disaster reconstruction and community development. We argue that
   institutional capacity (and capacity deficits) and the procedural
   vulnerability created in post-disaster responses are components of the
   risk landscape which require greater attention to diverse cultural
   values, protocols, and experiences in fostering resilient and inclusive
   disaster recovery approaches. In Taiwan, the particular complexities of
   Indigenous geographies, colonial and postcolonial circumstances, and
   contemporary political dynamics make developing approaches that are
   respectful of Indigenous cultural values, social aspirations, and
   political processes not only more difficult but also more important in
   shaping post-disaster community at multiple scales. Attentiveness to
   these values, aspirations, and processes generates opportunities for
   decreasing vulnerability to the extraordinary and the everyday disasters
   that communities confront.}},

Abstract = {{Natural selection has shaped the physiological properties of sensory
   systems across species, yielding large variations in their sensitivity.
   Here, we used laser stimulation of skin nociceptors, a widely used
   technique to investigate pain in rats and humans, to provide a vivid
   example of how ignoring these variations can lead to serious
   misconceptions in sensory neuroscience. In 6 experiments, we
   characterized and compared the physiological properties of the
   electrocortical responses elicited by laser stimulation in rats and
   humans. We recorded the electroencephalogram from the surface of the
   brain in freely moving rats and from the scalp in healthy humans. Laser
   stimuli elicited 2 temporally distinct responses, traditionally
   interpreted as reflecting the concomitant activation of different
   populations of nociceptors with different conduction velocities:
   small-myelinated Ad-fibres and unmyelinated C-fibres. Our results show
   that this interpretation is valid in humans, but not in rats. Indeed,
   the early response recorded in rats does not reflect the activation of
   the somatosensory system, but of the auditory system by laser-generated
   ultrasounds. These results have wide implications: retrospectively, as
   they prompt for a reconsideration of a large number of previous
   interpretations of electrocortical rat recordings in basic, preclinical,
   and pharmacological research, and prospectively, as they will allow
   recording truly pain-related cortical responses in rats.}},

Abstract = {{By using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate
   laser-driven ion acceleration and compression from a thin DT foil in a
   double-cone configuration. By using two counter-propagating laser
   pulses, it is shown that a double-cone structure can effectively guide,
   focus, and strengthen the incident laser pulses, resulting in the
   enhanced acceleration and compression of D+ and T+. Due to the ion
   Coulomb repulsion and the effective screening from the external laser
   electric fields, the transverse diffusion of ions is significantly
   suppressed. Finally, the peak energy density of the compressed ions
   exceeds 2.73 x 10(16) J/m(3), which is about five orders of magnitude
   higher than the threshold for high energy density physics, 10(11)
   J/m(3). Under this condition, DT fusion reactions are initiated and the
   neutron production rate per volume is estimated to be as high as 7.473 x
   10(35)/m(3) s according to Monte Carlo simulations. It is much higher
   than that of the traditional large neutron sources, which may facilitate
   many potential applications. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of railway ballast damage under a concrete sleeper is
   investigated by following the Bayesian approach. The use of a discrete
   modeling method to capture the distribution of ballast stiffiness under
   the sleeper introduces artificial stiffiness discontinuities between
   different ballast regions. This increases the effects of modeling errors
   and reduces the accuracy of the ballast damage detection results. In
   this paper, a continuous modeling method was developed to overcome this
   diffculty. The uncertainties induced by modeling error and measurement
   noise are the major difficulties of vibration-based damage detection
   methods. In the proposed methodology, Bayesian probabilistic approach is
   adopted to explicitly address the uncertainties associated with the
   identified model parameters. In the model updating process, the
   stiffiness of the ballast foundation is assumed to be continuous along
   the sleeper by using a polynomial of order N. One of the contributions
   of this paper is to calculate the order N conditional on a given set of
   measurement utilizing the Bayesian model class selection method. The
   proposed ballast damage detection methodology was verified with
   vibration data obtained from a segment of full-scale ballasted track
   under laboratory conditions, and the experimental verification results
   are very encouraging showing that it is possible to use the Bayesian
   approach along with the newly developed continuous modeling method for
   the purpose of ballast damage detection.}},

Abstract = {{System integration and power-flow control of on-board power sources are
   critical to the performance and cost competitiveness of hybrid electric
   vehicles (HEVs). The existing methods mostly focus on fuel minimization
   in hybrid powertrains, while disregarding many other concerns. This
   article presents an innovative multicriteria optimization approach and
   showcases its validity and usefulness in a case study of a fuel-cell
   hybrid bus. Three key technical contributions are made. First, a convex
   multicriteria optimization framework is devised for quickly and
   efficiently evaluating the optimal tradeoffs between the fuel-cell
   durability and hydrogen economy in the bus, as well as the corresponding
   fuel-cell dimension. Second, the impact of driving pattern on both the
   optimal fuel-cell size and Pareto optimality is investigated by
   considering discrepant driving schedules. Finally, a preliminary but
   useful economic assessment in both current and future scenarios is
   performed to explore the most cost-effective tradeoff.}},

Title = {{Effects of PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 on overcoming drug resistance and
   eliminating cancer stem cells in human breast cancer cells}},
Journal = {{CELL DEATH \& DISEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype often accompanies activation of
   the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, which renders a
   survival signal to withstand cytotoxic anticancer drugs and enhances
   cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics. As a result, PI3K/AKT-blocking
   approaches have been proposed as antineoplastic strategies, and
   inhibitors of PI3K/AKT are currently being trailed clinically in breast
   cancer patients. However, the effects of PI3K inhibitors on MDR breast
   cancers have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, the
   tumorigenic properties of three MDR breast cancer cell lines to a
   selective inhibitor of PI3K, NVP-BKM120 (BKM120), were assessed. We
   found that BKM120 showed a significant cytotoxic activity on MDR breast
   cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. When doxorubicin (DOX) was
   combined with BKM120, strong synergistic antiproliferative effect was
   observed. BKM120 activity induced the blockage of PI3K/AKT signaling and
   NF-kappa B expression, which in turn led to activate caspase-3/7 and
   caspase-9 and changed the expression of several apoptosis-related gene
   expression. Furthermore, BKM120 effectively eliminated CSC subpopulation
   and reduced sphere formation of these drug-resistant cells. Our findings
   indicate that BKM120 partially overcomes the MDR phenotype in
   chemoresistant breast cancer through cell apoptosis induction and CSC
   abolishing, which appears to be mediated by the inhibition of the
   PI3K/AKT/NF-kappa B axis. This offers a strong rationale to explore the
   therapeutic strategy of using BKM120 alone or in combination for
   chemotherapy-nonresponsive breast cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{A cathodic-arc evaporation system with plasma-enhanced duct equipment

   (N-2 and C2H2) activated by the Ti and Zr plasma in the evaporation
   process was used to deposit the TiZrCNand TiZr/a-C coatings with
   different C and nitrogen contents. The crystalline structures and
   bonding states of coatings were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. The microbial activity of the coatings was
   evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria) and
   Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Gram-negative bacteria) by in
   vitro antibacterial analysis using a fluorescence staining method
   employing SYTO9 and a bacterial-viability test on an agar plate. The
   cell compatibility and morphology related to CCD-966SK cell-line human
   skin fibroblast cells on the coated samples were also determined using
   the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
   assay, reverse-transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction, and scanning
   electron microscopy. The results suggest that the TiZrCN coatings not
   only possess better antibacterial performance than TiZrN and TiZr/a-C
   coatings but also maintain good compatibility with human skin fibroblast
   cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gene delivery into cells can be facilitated by adding plasmid
   DNA/transfection reagent complexes in culture medium or pre-adsorbing
   the complexes on the substrate before cell seeding. Using transfection
   reagents, however, often causes cytotoxicity. Effective delivery of
   naked plasmid without any transfection reagent remains a challenge. In
   this study, we cultured human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem
   cells (hMSCs) on different biomaterial substrates with different
   physico-chemical properties and examined the transfectability of naked
   plasmid. Specifically, we synthesized a negatively charged polyurethane
   (PU) to mimic the hyaluronan-modified chitosan (CS-HA) membranes
   previously found to promote the transfection of naked plasmid. We
   observed that the PU membranes were as effective as CS-HA membranes in
   substrate-mediated delivery of naked plasmid into hMSCs. PU membranes
   with surface microgrooves further increased the gene delivery efficiency
   to a similar level as the commercial transfection reagent but without
   the harmful effect. The gene delivery efficiency was associated with the
   extent of activation of cellular integrins beta 1 and alpha 5 on
   different substrates. Moreover, the delivery efficiency was positively
   correlated with the cell migration rate on various substrates. The
   substrate-mediated gene delivery by synthetic polymeric substrates
   supports that integrin activation and cell behavior (e.g. migration and
   transfectability) changes can be modulated by synthetic polymer surface
   with microfeatures. The transfection by PU microgrooves is easy,
   nontoxic, and as effective as the commercial transfection reagent. (C)

Abstract = {{We investigate whether women audit partners earn lower audit fees than
   their men colleagues. By examining 2002-2011 fee data for audit
   engagements in Taiwan, where the names of signing audit partners are
   disclosed, we find that audit engagements with women audit partners are
   related to significantly lower audit fees than those with men
   counterparts. Furthermore, we document that such fee difference is
   aggravated in the industries with fewer women audit partners, cannot be
   explained by the differences in audit quality and audit reporting lags,
   and is robust to controlling for firm fixed effects. Our finding
   provides evidence to support the existence of fee discrimination against
   women audit partners in Taiwan's auditing industry. Our results should
   be of interests to audit firms with regard to human resource decisions.

Title = {{Coagulation and Fibrinolytic Activity of Tenecteplase and Alteplase in

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-We compared the fibrinolytic activity of
   tenecteplase and alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke, and
   explored the association between hypofibrinogenaemia and intracerebral
   hemorrhage.
   Methods-Venous blood samples from a subgroup of participants in the
   Alteplase-Tenecteplase Trial Evaluation for Stroke Thrombolysis (ATTEST)
   study were obtained at pretreatment, 3 to 12 hours, and 24 +/- 3 hours
   post-intravenous thrombolysis for analyses of plasminogen, plasminogen
   activator inhibitor-1, (D)-dimer, factor V, fibrinogen, and fibrin(ogen)
   degradation products, in addition to routine coagulation assays. Related
   sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to test the within-group
   changes, and independent Mann-Whitney tests for between-group
   differences.
   Results-Thirty patients were included (alteplase=14 and tenecteplase=16)
   with similar baseline demographics. Compared with baseline, alteplase
   caused significant hypofibrinogenaemia (P=0.002), prolonged prothrombin
   time (P=0.011), hypoplasminogenaemia (P=0.001), and lower factor V
   (P=0.002) at 3 to 12 hours after administration with persistent
   hypofibrinogenaemia at 24 hours (P=0.011), whereas only minor
   hypoplasminogenaemia (P=0.029) was seen in the tenecteplase group.
   Tenecteplase consumed less plasminogen (P<0.001) and fibrinogen
   (P=0.002) compared with alteplase.
   Conclusions-In patients with acute ischemic stroke, alteplase 0.9 mg/kg
   caused significant disruption of the fibrinolytic system, whereas
   tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg did not, consistent with the trend toward lower
   intracerebral hemorrhage incidence with tenecteplase in the ATTEST
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of human immunodeficiency virus dynamics in acquired immuno
   deficiency syndrome (AIDS) research are very important in evaluating the
   effectiveness of antiretroviral (ARV) therapies. The potency of ARV
   agents in AIDS clinical trials can be assessed on the basis of a viral
   response such as viral decay rate or viral load change in plasma.
   Following ARV treatment, the profile of each subject's viral load tends
   to follow a broken stick'-like dynamic trajectory, indicating multiple
   phases of decline and increase in viral loads. Such multiple-phases
   (change-points) can be described by a random change-point model with
   random subject-specific parameters. One usually assumes a normal
   distribution for model error. However, this assumption may be
   unrealistic, obscuring important features of within- and among-subject
   variations. In this article, we propose piecewise linear mixed-effects
   models with skew-elliptical distributions to describe the time trend of
   a response variable under a Bayesian framework. This methodology can be
   widely applied to real problems for longitudinal studies. A real data
   analysis, using viral load data from an AIDS study, is carried out to
   illustrate the proposed method by comparing various candidate models.
   Biologically important findings are reported, and these findings also
   suggest that it is very important to assume a model with skew
   distribution in order to achieve reliable results, in particular, when
   the data exhibit skewness.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional approach to wastewater system design and planning
   considers each component separately and does not provide the optimum
   performance of the entire system. However, the growing concern for
   environmental protection, economic efficiency, and sustainability of
   urban wastewater systems requires an integrated modeling of subsystems
   and a synthetic evaluation of multiple objectives. In this study, a
   multiobjective optimization model of an integrated urban wastewater
   system was developed. The model encompasses subsystems, such as a sewer
   system, stormwater management, municipal wastewater treatment, and a
   wastewater reclamation system. The non-dominated sorting genetic
   algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to generate a range of system design
   possibilities to optimize conflicting environmental and economic
   objectives. Information from a knowledge base, which included rules for
   generating treatment trains as well as the performance characteristics
   of commonly used water pollution control measures, was utilized. The
   trade-off relationships between the objectives, total water pollution
   loads to the environment, and life cycle costs (which consist of
   investment as well as operation and maintenance costs), can be
   illustrated using Pareto charts. The developed model can be used to
   assist decision makers in the preliminary planning of system structure.
   A benchmark city was constructed to illustrate the methods of
   multi-objective controls, highlight cost-effective water pollution
   control measures, and identify the main pressures on urban water
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Citrate is a key regulatory metabolic intermediate as it facilitates the
   integration of the glycolysis and lipid synthesis pathways. Inhibition
   of hepatic extracellular citrate uptake, by blocking the sodium-coupled
   citrate transporter (NaCT or SLC13A5), has been suggested as a potential
   therapeutic approach to treat metabolic disorders. NaCT transports
   citrate from the blood into the cell coupled to the transport of sodium
   ions. The studies herein report the identification and characterization
   of a novel small dicarboxylate molecule (compound 2) capable of
   selectively and potently inhibiting citrate transport through NaCT, both
   in vitro and in vivo. Binding and transport experiments indicate that 2
   specifically binds NaCT in a competitive and stereosensitive manner, and
   is recognized as a substrate for transport by NaCT. The favorable
   pharmacokinetic properties of 2 permitted in vivo experiments to
   evaluate the effect of inhibiting hepatic citrate uptake on metabolic
   endpoints.}},

Abstract = {{Sounding rocket measurements conducted in 1988 under high solar activity
   conditions revealed that the intensity of thermospheric OI emissions at
   98.9nm presents an anomalous vertical profile, showing exospheric
   intensities much higher than expected from radiative transfer model
   results, which included the known sources of excited oxygen. All
   attempts based on modeling of the photochemical processes and radiative
   transfer were unable to account for the higher than predicted
   brightnesses. More recently, the SOHO-Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of
   Emitted Radiation instrument measured the UV solar flux at high-spectral
   resolution, revealing the importance of a significant additional source
   of oxygen emission at 98.9nm that had not been accounted for before. In
   this study, we simulate the radiative transfer of the OI-98.9nm
   multiplet, including the photochemical sources of excited oxygen, the
   resonant scattering of solar photons, and the effects of nonthermal
   atoms, i.e., a population of fast-moving oxygen atoms in excess of the
   Maxwellian distribution. Including resonance scattering of the 98.9nm
   solar multiplet, we find good agreement with the previous sounding
   rocket observation. The inclusion of a nonthermal oxygen population with
   a consistent increase of the total density produces a larger intensity
   at high altitude that apparently better accounts for the observation,
   but such a correction cannot be demonstrated given the uncertainties of
   the observations. A good agreement between model and sounding rocket
   observation is also found with the triplet at 130.4 nm. We further
   investigate the radiative transfer of the OI-98.9nm multiplet and the
   oxygen emissions at 130.4 and 135.6nm using observations from the
   STP78-1 satellite. We find a less satisfying agreement between the model
   and the STP78-1 data that can be accounted for by scaling the modeled
   intensity within a range acceptable given the uncertainties on the
   STP78-1 absolute calibration.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial instabilities, including side reactions due to
   electrolyte decompositions and Cobalt (Co) dissolutions, are the main
   detrimental processes at LiCoO2 cathode when a high-voltage window (>4.2
   V) is applied. Nevertheless, cycling the cathode with a voltage above
   4.2 V would deliver an increased gravimetric capacity, which is desired
   for high power battery operation. To address these drawbacks, we
   demonstrate a synergistic approach by manufacturing the
   three-dimensional high-temperature LiCoO2 electrodes (3D HT-LCO) using
   laser-microstructuring, laser-annealing and subsequent coating with
   polymerized C-60 thin films (C-60@3D HT-LCO) by plasma-assisted thermal
   evaporation. The C-60@3D HT-LCO cathode delivers higher initial
   discharge capacity compared to its theoretical value, i.e. 175 mA h
   g(-1) at 0.1 C with cut-off voltage of 3.0-4.5 V. This cathode combines
   the advantages of the 3D electrode architecture and an advanced Co
   coating/passivation concept leading to an improved electrochemical
   performance, due to an increased active surface area, a decreased charge
   transfer resistance, a prevented Co dissolution into the electrolyte and
   a suppressed side reaction and electrolyte decomposition. This work
   provides a novel solution for other cathode materials having similar
   concerns in high potential regimes for application in lithium-ion
   microbatteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report multiplicative noise-induced threshold shift of

   Controlling the thermal fluctuation (i.e., additive noise) of the

   examined at various noise levels {[}characterized by their intensity and
   cutoff frequency (f(c))]. For a sufficiently strong H (i.e., ignorable
   additive noise), a modified noise sensitivity characterizing the shift
   problem is in good agreement with experimental results for colored as
   well as white noise (f(c) -> infinity); until now, there was a large
   deviation for (sufficiently) colored noises. The present study shows
   that H provides us with ideal conditions for studying the corresponding
   Carr-Helfrich theory considering pure multiplicative noise.}},

Abstract = {{While X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) is a fundamental analytical
   technique used by solid-state laboratories across a breadth of
   disciplines, it is still underrepresented in most undergraduate
   curricula. In this work, we incorporate XRPD analysis into an
   inquiry-based project that requires students to identify the crystalline
   component(s) of familiar household products. Centering the project on
   materials which students encounter in their everyday lives helps to
   demystify the technique, making it accessible to everyone with a basic
   understanding of crystallinity and unit cells. In an XRPD study, each
   crystalline component generates a unique set of peaks in the
   diffractogram. Comparing the collected diffractogram to a library of
   diffractograms for known crystalline materials allows students to
   identify the crystalline components in their unknown. Students must
   determine for themselves the chemical compositions of the possible
   unknowns, and link their findings back to the analysis of the collected
   data. Initially challenging, this is the part of the work they respond
   to most strongly. This lab includes a data collection component, but its
   inquiry-based objectives can still be achieved by providing the students
   with simulated diffractograms when the appropriate instrumentation is
   unavailable.}},

Abstract = {{The degree of development and operability of the indicators for the
   Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) using Descriptor 1 (D1)
   Biological Diversity was assessed. To this end, an overview of the
   relevance and degree of operability of the underlying parameters across
   20 European countries was compiled by analysing national directives,
   legislation, regulations, and publicly available reports. Marked
   differences were found between countries in the degree of ecological
   relevance as well as in the degree of implementation and operability of
   the parameters chosen to indicate biological diversity. The best scoring
   EU countries were France, Germany, Greece and Spain, while the worst
   scoring countries were Italy and Slovenia. No country achieved maximum
   scores for the implementation of MSFD D1. The non-EU countries Norway
   and Turkey score as highly as the top-scoring EU countries. On the
   positive side, the chosen parameters for D1 indicators were generally
   identified as being an ecologically relevant reflection of Biological
   Diversity. On the negative side however, less than half of the chosen
   parameters are currently operational. It appears that at a pan-European
   level, no consistent and harmonized approach currently exists for the
   description and assessment of marine biological diversity. The
   implementation of the MSFD Descriptor 1 for Europe as a whole can
   therefore at best be marked as moderately successful.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in sexual and gender dimorphism in disease.
   We reviewed the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   aureus (MRSA) carriage and bloodstream infection (BSI), which shows a
   male predominance, and explored some of the possible reasons. Males are
   more prone to bacterial sepsis, but some studies suggest females may
   have a poorer prognosis from BSI. Hand-hygiene behavior varies according
   to gender. Males are less compliant, which in turn may predispose them
   to higher colonization and infection rates. Female hormones such as
   estrogen affect the expression of virulence factors in Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa, and although not studied, this may also apply to S. aureus.
   Further research is required on the relationship between gender and risk
   of infection, the reasons for higher MRSA carriage and BSI rates in
   males, the value of gender-specific infection prevention campaigns, and
   other factors such as the possible role of contact sports and
   occupation.}},

Title = {{High-Quality Foster Care Mitigates Callous-Unemotional Traits Following
   Early Deprivation in Boys: A Randomized Controlled Trial}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Callous-unemotional (CU) traits in childhood are a
   developmental precursor to psychopathy, yet the origins and etiology of
   CU traits are not known. We examined CU traits among 12-year-old
   children exposed to severe early deprivation and evaluated whether a
   high-quality foster care intervention mitigated the development of high
   levels of CU traits.
   Method: Participants were from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project,
   a randomized controlled trial of foster care for children in
   institutions. Children were recruited from institutions in Bucharest,
   Romania, along with age-and sex-matched children who were never
   institutionalized. Children raised in institutional settings were
   randomized (mean(age) = 22 months) to either a foster care group (n =
   68) or a care-as-usual group (n = 68). CU traits were assessed at age
   12.75 years in available participants from the randomized trial (n = 95)
   and children who were never institutionalized (n = 50).
   Results: Children who experienced institutional rearing as young
   children had significantly higher levels of CU traits in early
   adolescence compared to children who were never institutionalized.
   Intent-to-treat analysis indicated that, among boys, CU traits were
   significantly lower among those who received the foster care
   intervention compared to those randomized to care as usual. Caregiver
   responsiveness to distress, but not caregiver warmth, mediated the
   intervention effect on CU traits in boys.
   Conclusion: These findings provide the first evidence to date that
   psychosocial intervention can prevent the onset of CU traits. Although
   severe early deprivation predicted higher levels of CU traits,
   high-quality foster care that emphasized responsive caregiving reduced
   the impact of deprivation on CU trait development for boys.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{96-103}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a known endocrine disruptor,
   has been demonstrated to affect fetal development in animal studies, but
   findings in human studies have been inconsistent.
   Objectives: We investigated whether maternal exposure to BPA during
   pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of infant low birth
   weight (LBW).
   Methods: A total 452 mother-infant pairs (113 LBW cases and 339 matched
   controls) were selected from the participants enrolled in the
   prospective Health Baby Cohort (HBC) in Wuhan city, China, during
   2012-2014. BPA concentrations were measured in maternal urine samples
   collected at delivery, and the information of birth outcomes was
   retrieved from the medical records. A conditional logistic regression
   was used to evaluate the relationship between urinary BPA levels and
   LBW.
   Results: Mothers with LBW infants had significantly higher urinary BPA
   levels (median: 4.70 mu g/L) than the control mothers (median: 2.25 mu
   g/L) (p < 0.05). Increased risk of LBW was associated with higher
   maternal urinary levels of BPA {[}adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 3.13 for
   the medium tertile, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 121,8.08; adjusted OR
   = 2.49 for the highest tertile, 95\% CI: 0.98, 636]. The association was
   more pronounced among female infants than among male infants, with a
   statistical evidence of heterogeneity in risk (p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to higher levels of BPA may potentially
   increase the risk of delivering LBW infants, especially for female
   infants. This is the first case-control study to examine the association
   in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   microscopy (FESEM). Sensing performance was examined by a simple and
   reliable electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. FESEM
   images indicated that PSi pores were filled by small particles with
   uniform grain size with increased stabilizer concentration. At higher
   concentrations, a slight position shift of XRD peaks to a lower angle
   occurred, and this finding may be due to decreased tensile stress in ZnO
   thin films. Results showed excellent performance in sensor response to
   ethanol solution at stabilizer concentration of 0.4M which can be
   attributed to the high concentration of oxygen defects in the form of
   interstitial oxygen and deep-level defects introduced into the film. (C)

Abstract = {{The entomopathogenic fungal infection of target hosts depends on
   pathogen fitness and host defence mechanisms. Pathogen-host interactions
   in red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus larvae are poorly
   understood. In order to explore this interaction, 4th, 8th, and 12th
   instar red palm weevil larvae were immersed in conidial suspensions of
   four isolates of Beauveria bassiana. Significant differences in the
   virulence of the tested isolates were revealed by LT50 values. Conidia
   of B8463, a highly virulent isolate, showed 33.53 \% higher relative
   hydrophobicity and twice as much Pr1 activity than conidia of B8465.
   Growth indices, calculated after 72 h of incubation, revealed
   significant differences in the food utilization efficiencies of all
   studied larval instars infected with different isolates. Conidial
   infection with B8463 caused 39-45 \% reduction in efficacy of
   consumption of ingested food (ECI) and 55-61 \% reduction in digested
   food (ECD). The least virulent isolate, B8465, caused the smallest
   reduction in ECI (2-4 \%) and ECD (3-9 \%). Furthermore, enhanced
   expression of target antioxidant genes (catalases and peroxidase) was
   observed in larvae infected with virulent isolates. Similarly,
   approximate digestibility showed an opposite trend, with the highest
   values being recorded from samples infected with the most virulent
   conidia (B8463) at each studied larval instar. In conclusion, isolate
   B8463 significantly affected the growth and development of red palm
   weevil larvae and has good potential for use in eco-friendly R.

Abstract = {{Street dust is an indicator of pollution status of a city area. We
   present comprehensive assessment of USEPA's priority 16 Polycyclic
   Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), carbon and heavy metals in street dust of
   Guwahati, a fast growing city of the Brahmaputra Valley. On assessment
   of different representative landuse classes, the concentrations of PAHs
   were found to decrease spatially in the order of industrial, commercial,
   institutional, residential and forest site. The profile of PAHs was
   dominated by 2- and 4-ring compounds and the carcinogenic PAHs (CPAHs)
   were found to be in the range of 16-55\% of Sigma PAHs. The mean
   toxicity in terms of Benzo(a)pyrene equivalent (BaPq) concentrations
   varied seasonally, which was found to be maximum during pre-monsoon.
   Principal Component Analysis, diagnostic ratios and correlations of PAHs
   with heavy metal implied that the PAHs originated mainly from coal and
   wood burning, and vehicular emission. Seasonality in sources of PAHs
   with respect to the diagnostic ratios was discovered and signatory
   influence of local sources was found during the pre-monsoon. The
   correlations of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) with PAHs were
   found to show seasonality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Liquid fructose supplementation in LDL-R-/- mice fed a western-type diet
   enhances lipid burden and atherosclerosis despite identical calorie
   consumption}},
Journal = {{IJC METABOLIC \& ENDOCRINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Studies on humans have related the high consumption of
   fructose, especially in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages, to
   obesity, fatty liver, and hypercholesterolemia, all risk factors for
   atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to determine
   whether supplementation of liquid fructose (SLF), in either a normal,
   healthy chow or aWestern-style chow, promoted the appearance of
   atherosclerosis in a rodent model.
   Methods: LDL receptor knockoutmicewere fed for twelveweekswith normal
   chow, normal chowplus ad libitum 15\% fructose solution, Western chow,
   or Western chow plus ad libitum 15\% fructose solution (W+F). Food and
   liquid intake and body weight were periodically monitored. At the end of
   the study, plasma and hepatic lipids, liver histology and expression of
   genes related to lipid handling were analyzed and histological and
   immunohistological analyses of atherosclerosis at the aortic origin was
   performed.
   Results: Total calorie intake was significantly increased in Western-fed
   vs normal chow-fed mice, but was not modified by SLF. SLF significantly
   increased body weight, visceral adiposity, plasma lipids and liver
   cholesterol content inWestern-fed mice, probably due to an increase in
   de novo lipid synthesis. Aortic atherosclerotic total lesion areawas
   significantly correlated to plasma lipids, being highest in W+F mice.
   Further, SLF induced higher immunostaining for macrophages and
   oxidized-LDL receptor, independently of lesion area and caloric burden.
   Conclusions: SLF, without changing total calorie intake, increases
   atherosclerosis, visceral adipose tissue and cholesterol burden in a
   background of overweight LDL receptor knockout mice consuming an
   unhealthy, Western-type solid rodent chow. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The characteristics of gasification reactions for carbonecarbonate
   mixtures were experimentally investigated at high temperatures up to 900
   degrees C, considering the application of the mixtures to the external
   anode media of a direct carbon fuel cell. A thermo-gravimetric analysis
   (TGA) was conducted in either a nitrogen or carbon dioxide ambient
   environment for Li2CO3, K2CO3 and a mixture of these two substances with
   carbon black. Changes in the exit gas composition were also monitored
   during the heating process. It was shown that gasification in the
   mixture media occurs much more rapidly than carbonate decomposition at
   elevated temperatures, even for low concentrations of CO2. It was also
   shown that the loading of carbonates to carbon significantly affects the
   global gasification reaction; it increased the reaction rate by an order
   of magnitude and decreased its activation energy. Based on the
   experimental observations, a simplified reaction model of gasification
   was suggested for the anode media of a DCFC, regarding
   carbonate-catalysed and metal-catalysed pathways of Boudouard reactions.

Abstract = {{Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive autoinflammatory
   disorder. The balance between the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta
   and its receptor antagonist IL-1RA plays an important role in the
   development of FMF. In order to determine a possible association of
   polymorphisms in IL-1 beta and IL-1RA genes with occurrence and/or
   severity of the disease, 42 genetically confirmed FMF patients and 42
   controls were genotyped for IL-1 beta(-511C/T), IL-1 beta(-31T/C), IL1-1
   beta(+3954T/C) and IL-1RA VNTR polymorphisms. IL-1 beta and IL-1RA
   levels were evaluated by multiplex ELISA in supernatants of PBMC
   cultures of 30 FMF patients with and without 24h stimulation of
   monocytes by LPS. The CC genotype and C allele at positions -31 and +
   3954 of IL-1 beta gene were more frequent in FMF patients than in
   controls. FMF patients carriers of IL-1 beta(-31) CC genotype were
   associated with a 2-fold increase in LPS-induced IL-1 beta secretion as
   well as a higher disease severity score (11.2 +/- 2.9) when compared to
   patients carrying the TC and TT genotypes (6.1 +/- 2.1 and 4.5 +/- 2.4,
   respectively). These results indicate that IL-1 beta gene polymorphisms
   at positions -31 and + 3954 may be associated with an increased risk for
   FMF. IL-1 beta(-31) contributes also to the severity of the disease,
   probably by modulating IL-1 beta synthesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{Spinal cord cavernomas are rare, and progressive growth can lead to
   neurologic deterioration. Complete microsurgical resection using the
   OmniGuideA (R) fiber-optic CO2 laser is safe, precise, and can prevent
   further neurological deterioration. We describe the process, risks, and
   benefits associated with this approach.
   Once the cavernoma is isolated, the CO2 laser enables the surgeon to
   incise and photocoagulate with the same instrument, increasing the
   accuracy and potentially reducing the procedure's duration. The spinal
   cord and surrounding tissue are protected from the laser by
   cerebrospinal fluid and cottonoid pledges.
   The fiber-optic CO2 laser is safe and effective when resecting spinal
   cord cavernomas. Personal experience, coupled with recent literature,
   brings us to this conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Recommended treatments for spontaneous intracranial
   hypotension (SIH) range from bed rest only to neurosurgery. However, the
   serious form of SIH is poorly defined. A better description of patient
   characteristics and their outcome may help define therapeutic options.
   METHODS: We reviewed 24 cases of patients with SIH and separated them
   into 2 groups according to whether or not they presented with signs of
   severity at admission: disturbance of consciousness, subdural hematomas
   (SDHs), and cerebral venous thrombosis.
   RESULTS: Nine patients (37\%) were classified as having a serious form
   of SIH: six (25\%) presented SDHs; three (12\%) disturbance of
   consciousness; and one (4\%) cerebral venous thrombosis. Bed rest and
   epidural blood patches (EBPs) were sufficient to treat all patients in
   the nonserious form group and 4 patients in the serious form group. Two
   patients (8\%) had to undergo cerebrospinal fluid leak repair, and 3
   others (12\%) evacuation of SDHs. Outcome was good in both groups, with
   only one (4\%) death due to extensive SDHs. Times to diagnosis in the
   serious form group (63 vs. 35 days, P = 0.052) and to recovery (9 months
   vs. 5 months, P = 0.088) tended to be higher without reaching
   difference.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of SDHs, disturbance of consciousness, and a
   trend toward a longer time to diagnosis and recovery seem to define the
   serious form of SIH. These patients may require exploration and surgical
   repair of cerebrospinal fluid leak, only after failure of conservative
   measures-bed rest and time-and EBP, with good outcome.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN NEONATAL CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{394-406}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Preterm infants' mothers face several challenges when
   providing critical breast milk for their infants; therefore, sensitive
   and evidence-based counseling and support are needed. However, a general
   view of the experiences preterm infants' mothers can face during their
   infants' hospitalization and after discharge is lacking.
   Purpose: The aim of this integrative review was to explore practical and
   emotional experiences of preterm infants' mothers with respect to breast
   milk expression and breastfeeding, from the birth of the preterm infant,
   during the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay, and postdischarge
   until the cessation of breastfeeding.
   Methods/Search Strategy: A systematic literature search from MEDLINE,
   CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Cochrane databases were performed. The search
   resulted in 20 qualitative and 3 quantitative studies. The data were
   analyzed by thematic analysis. Findings: Coping was the central theme in
   mothers' experiences. The benefits of breast milk served both as a
   supportive factor and an obstructive factor for the mothers, and
   breastfeeding was used to rebuild connection and motherhood.
   Simultaneously, the mothers needed to cope with new demands, interfering
   NICU environment, demanding expressing, and difficulties with
   breastfeeding.
   Implications for Practice: Expressing and breastfeeding are important
   for the mothers to contribute to their infants' care and to rebuild the
   interrupted connection. Evidence-based and sensitive informational and
   practical counseling are vital for the mothers. Intensive emotional
   support is important during encountered problems and during cessation.
   Implications for Research: Future research is needed about mothers'
   experiences using supplementation methods, test-weighing, exploring
   experiences of mothers of late-preterm infants, and the validity of the
   concept of coping with this phenomenon.}},

   test, was assessed in a subset of 80 patients. The PWV, CFR,
   longitudinal strain and strain rate, \%dpTw-Utw(MVO), \%dpTw-Utw(PEF),
   and \%dpTw-Utw(EDF) were impaired in hypertensive patients compared with
   controls. In multivariable analysis, CFR, PWV, LV mass, and systolic
   blood pressure were independent determinants of longitudinal strain,
   strain rate, and untwisting markers (P < 0.05). Increased TGFb-1 was
   related with increased collagen synthesis markers, TIMP-1 and MMP-9 and
   these biomarkers were associated with impaired longitudinal systolic
   strain rate, untwisting markers, CFR and PWV (P < 0.05). Delayed
   untwisting as assessed by reduced \%dpTw - Utw(EDF) was related with
   increased NT-proBNP and reduced VO2 (P < 0.05).
   ConclusionsImpaired LV untwisting is associated with increased arterial
   stiffness and coronary microcirculatory dysfunction, and is linked to
   reduced exercise capacity and neurohumoral activation in hypertensive
   heart disease. A fibrotic process may be the common link between
   vascular dysfunction and abnormal myocardial deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Manual data collection and entry is one of the bottlenecks in
   conventional disaster management information systems. Time is a critical
   factor in emergency situations and timely data collection and processing
   may help in saving several lives. An effective disaster management
   system needs to collect data from World Wide Web automatically. A
   prerequisite for data collection process is document classification
   mechanism to classify a particular document into different categories.
   Ontologies are formal bodies of knowledge used to capture machine
   understandable semantics of a domain of interest and have been used
   successfully to support document classification in various domains. This
   paper presents an ontology-based document classification technique for
   automatic data collection in a disaster management system. A general
   ontology of disasters is used that contains the description of several
   natural and man-made disasters. The proposed technique augments the
   conventional classification measures with the ontological knowledge to
   improve the precision of classification. A preliminary implementation of
   the proposed technique shows promising results with up to 10\% overall
   improvement in precision when compared with conventional classification
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present methodology for parameters identification of
   constitutive model which is able to present behavior of a connection
   between two members in a structure. Such a constitutive model for frame
   connections can be cast in the most general form of the Timoshenko beam,
   which can present three failure modes. The first failure mode pertains
   to the bending in connection, which is defmed as coupled
   plasticity-damage model with nonlinear softening. The second failure
   mode is seeking to capture the shearing of connection, which is defmed
   as plasticity with linear hardening and nonlinear softening. The third
   failure mode pertains to the diffuse failure in the members; excluding
   it leads to linear elastic constitutive law. Theoretical formulation of
   this Timoshenko beam model and its finite element implementation are
   presented in the second section. The parameter identification procedure
   that will allow us to define eighteen unknown parameters is given in
   Section 3. The proposed methodology splits identification in three
   phases, with all details presented in Section 4 through three different
   examples. We also present the real experimental results. The conclusions

Abstract = {{Water is one of the most essential nutrients for the maintenance of
   chicks' function, and delayed access to feed and water post hatch has
   been reported to dehydrate chicks. Aqua agar (AA) was formulated to
   contain more than 95\% water and an experiment was conducted to evaluate
   the effects of AA as water replacement for posthatch chicks during
   transportation. During the simulated transport, chicks were held for 24
   h with (AA group) or without (NO-AA group) aqua agar in chick boxes.
   During the holding period, chicks in the AA group lost less body weight,
   compared with the NO-AA group. However, the weight of residual yolk
   tended to be lower in the AA-treated birds. There were no significant
   differences in the weight of gizzard, proventriculus, and liver, nor in
   the weights and lengths of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. A higher
   body weight was also observed in the AA group at 7 days of age. At 21
   days of age, weight gain and feed intake were higher (P < 0.05) in the
   AA group, when compared to that of the NO-AA group. No significant
   differences were observed in the feed conversion rate (FCR) between the
   two groups. In conclusion, the data suggests that the use of AA as a
   water replacement could reduce the negative impact of water deficiency
   in posthatch period during transportation, resulting in greatly improved
   growth performance of young broilers at 21 days of age. (C) 2015,

   evaluation of the water resources (APHRODITE) data over a subtropical
   region of the Indian subcontinent for the seasonal rainfall over 6 years
   from June 2002 to September 2007. The data products examined include v7
   data from the TRMM radiometer Microwave Imager (TMI) and radar
   precipitation radar (PR), namely, 2A12, 2A25, and 2B31 (combined data
   from PR and TMI). The spatial distribution of uncertainty from these
   data products were quantified based on performance metrics derived from
   the contingency table. For the seasonal daily precipitation over a
   subtropical basin in India, the data product of 2A12 showed greater
   skill in detecting and quantifying the volume of rainfall when compared
   with the 2A25 and 2B31 data products. Error characterization using
   various error models revealed that random errors from multiplicative
   error models were homoscedastic and that they better represented
   rainfall estimates from 2A12 algorithm. Error decomposition techniques
   performed to disentangle systematic and random errors verify that the
   multiplicative error model representing rainfall from 2A12 algorithm
   successfully estimated a greater percentage of systematic error than
   2A25 or 2B31 algorithms. Results verify that although the radiometer
   derived 2A12 rainfall data is known to suffer from many sources of
   uncertainties, spatial analysis over the case study region of India
   testifies that the 2A12 rainfall estimates are in a very good agreement
   with the reference estimates for the data period considered.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This pilot study tested the preliminary efficacy of a
   theory-based bidirectional text messaging intervention (TEXT) on
   antiretroviral (ART) adherence, missed care visits, and substance use
   among people with HIV. Method: Participants with recent substance use
   and ART nonadherence from 2 nonurban HIV clinics were randomized to TEXT
   or to usual care (UC). The TEXT intervention included daily queries of
   ART adherence, mood, and substance use. The system sent contingent
   intervention messages created by participants for reports of
   adherence/nonadherence, good mood/poor mood, and no substance use/use.
   Assessments were at preintervention, postintervention, and 3-month
   postintervention follow-up. Objective primary outcomes were adherence,
   measured by past 3-month pharmacy refill rate, and proportion of missed
   visits (PMV), measured by medical records. The rate of substance-using
   days from the timeline follow-back was a secondary outcome. Results:
   Sixty-three patients participated, with 33 randomized to TEXT and 30 to
   UC. At preintervention, adherence was 64.0\%, PMV was 26.9\%, and
   proportion of days using substances was 53.0\%. At postintervention,
   adherence in the TEXT condition improved from 66\% to 85\%, compared
   with 62\% to 71\% in UC participants (p = .04). PMV improved from 23\%
   to 9\% for TEXT participants and 31\% to 28\% in UC participants (p =
   .12). There were no significant differences between conditions in
   substance-using days at postintervention. At 3-month follow-up,
   differences were not significant. Conclusions: Personalized
   bidirectional text messaging improved adherence and shows promise to
   improve visit attendance, but did not reduce substance using days. This
   intervention merits further testing and may be cost-efficient given its
   automation.}},

Abstract = {{The hippocampus has a key role in a number of neurodegenerative
   diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Here we present a novel method
   for the automated segmentation of the hippocampus from structural
   magnetic resonance images (MRI), based on a combination of multiple
   classifiers. The method is validated on a cohort of 50 T1 MRI scans,
   comprehending healthy control, mild cognitive impairment, and
   Alzheimer's Disease subjects. The preliminary release of the EADC-ADNI
   Harmonized Protocol training labels is used as gold standard. The fully
   automated pipeline consists of a registration using an affine
   transformation, the extraction of a local bounding box, and the
   classification of each voxel in two classes (background and
   hippocampus). The classification is performed slice-by-slice along each
   of the three orthogonal directions of the 3D-MRI using a Random Forest
   (RF) classifier, followed by a fusion of the three full segmentations.
   Dice coefficients obtained by multiple RF (0.87 +/- 0.03) are larger
   than those obtained by a single monolithic RF applied to the entire
   bounding box, and are comparable to state-of-the-art. A test on an
   external cohort of 50 T1 MRI scans shows that the presented method is
   robust and reliable. Additionally, a comparison of local changes in the
   morphology of the hippocampi between the three subject groups is
   performed. Our work showed that a multiple classification approach can
   be implemented for the segmentation for the measurement of volume and
   shape changes of the hippocampus with diagnostic purposes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and glycated albumin (GA) are
   frequently used as glycemic control markers. However, these markers are
   influenced by alterations in hemoglobin and albumin metabolism. Thus,
   conditions such as anemia, chronic renal failure, hypersplenism, chronic
   liver diseases, hyperthyroidism, hypoalbuminemia, and pregnancy need to
   be considered when interpreting HbA1c or GA values. Using data from
   patients with normal albumin and hemoglobin metabolism, we previously
   established a linear regression equation describing the GA value versus
   the HbA1c value to calculate an extrapolated HbA1c (eHbA1c) value for
   the accurate evaluation of glycemic control. In this study, we
   investigated the difference between the measured HbA1c and the eHbA1c
   values for patients with various conditions.
   MethodsData sets for a total of 2461 occasions were obtained from 731
   patients whose HbA1c and GA values were simultaneously measured. We
   excluded patients with missing data or changeable HbA1c levels, and
   patients who had received transfusions or steroids within the previous 3
   months. Finally, we included 44 patients with chronic renal failure
   (CRF), 10 patients who were undergoing hemodialysis (HD), 7 patients
   with hematological malignancies and a hemoglobin level of less than 10
   g/dL (HM), and 12 patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD).
   ResultsIn all the groups, the eHbA1c values were significantly higher
   than the measured HbA1c values. The median difference was 0.75 \% (95 \%
   CI 0.40-1.10 \%, P for the difference is < 0.001) in the CRF group, 0.80
   \% (95 \% CI 0.30-1.65 \%, P for the difference is 0.041) in the HD
   group, 0.90 \% (95 \% CI 0.90-1.30 \%, P for the difference is 0.028) in
   the HM group, and 0.85 \% (95 \% CI 0.40-1.50 \%, P for the difference
   is 0.009) in the CLD group.
   ConclusionsWe found that the measured HbA1c values were lower than the
   eHbA1c values in each of the groups.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of the Study: This study investigates the role of surrogates'
   involvement in their partners' end-of-life care planning, focusing on
   the relationship between the extent and type of end-of-life planning in
   which surrogates have been involved and the accuracy of their
   substituted judgments.
   Design and Methods: The data come from an internet survey collected by
   Knowledge Networks and the National Center for Family and Marriage
   Research. The national sample is comprised of 1,075 opposite-sex
   American couples aged 18-64. A series of multilevel negative binomial
   regression analyses were conducted.
   Results: Surrogates' involvement in multiple types of planning helped
   them to make accurate substituted judgments, whereas surrogates'
   involvement in informal discussions helped them to make accurate
   estimations primarily when they wanted limited care for themselves.
   Implications: This study highlights the importance of engaging in both
   advance directives and informal discussion. The findings also suggest
   that surrogates who want extensive care for themselves may need extra
   attention when practitioners assist them in making a substituted
   judgment.}},

   failure was defined as breakthrough pain which necessitated joint

Abstract = {{Intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) are depleted in response to an acute bout
   of exercise in lean endurance-trained individuals; however, it is
   unclear whether changes in IMCL content are also seen in response to
   acute and chronic exercise in obese individuals. We used magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy in 18 obese men and 5 normal-weight controls to
   assess IMCL content before and after an hour of cycling at the intensity
   corresponding with each participant's maximal whole-body rate of fat
   oxidation (Fat(max)). Fatmax was determined via indirect calorimetry
   during a graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer. The same outcome
   measures were reassessed in the obese group after a 16-week lifestyle
   intervention comprising dietary calorie restriction and exercise
   training. At baseline, IMCL content decreased in response to 1 h of
   cycling at Fatmax in controls (2.8 +/- 0.4 to 2.0 +/- 0.3 A.U., -39\%, p
   = 0.02), but not in obese (5.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 5.2 +/- 2.2 A.U.,p = 0.42).
   The lifestyle intervention lead to weight loss (-10.0 +/- 5.4 kg, p <
   0.001), improvements in maximal aerobic power (+5.2 +/- 3.4
   mL/(kg.min)), maximal fat oxidation rate (+0.19 +/- 0.22 g/min), and a
   29\% decrease in homeostasis model assessment score (all p < 0.05).
   However, when the 1 h of cycling at Fatmax was repeated after the
   lifestyle intervention, there remained no observable change in IMCL (4.6
   +/- 1.8 vs. 4.6 +/- 1.9 A.U., p = 0.92). In summary, there was no IMCL
   depletion in response to 1 h of cycling at moderate intensity either
   before or after the lifestyle intervention in obese men. An effective
   lifestyle intervention including moderate-intensity exercise training
   did not impact rate of utilisation of IMCL during acute exercise in
   obese men.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the admissibility of WikiLeaks diplomatic cables
   as evidence in international arbitral tribunals. Following the ICSID
   Tribunal's recent Decision in ConocoPhillips v Venezuela, Venezuela
   challenged the Decision utilizing WikiLeaks diplomatic cables containing
   confidential communications between ConocoPhillips' counsel and
   representatives from the US Embassy. This raises significant questions
   regarding what types of evidence are admissible in arbitral proceedings.
   Traditional international legal principles would point to such
   diplomatic communications being clearly inadmissible. However, the
   question is far less clear in a transnational arbitration, where the
   tribunal has the final authority over admitting evidence without being
   bound by international law. This article begins by considering the
   treatment of such evidence under international legal concepts and cases.
   It will then examine how such evidence has been treated by tribunals
   thus far within the developing transnational legal order. It will
   conclude by postulating how future ICSID tribunals might treat the
   admissibility and authenticity of WikiLeaks diplomatic cables.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Appropriate biopsy sampling is important for the
   classification of gastritis, yet the extent of inflammation and atrophy
   of different regions of the stomach with chronic gastritis have been
   addressed only in a few studies. The aim of our study was to analyze the
   inflammatory, atrophic and metaplastic changes in the greater and lesser
   curvature of the antrum and corpus mucosa.
   Methods: 420 patients undergoing upper endoscopy were enrolled in the
   study. Four expert gastrointestinal pathologists graded biopsy specimens
   according to the updated Sydney classification.
   Results. The obtained results showed that the mononuclear and
   granulocyte inflammatory cells were more prominent in the corpus lesser
   curvature compared to the corpus greater curvature (p=0.01 and p=0.0001,
   respectively). In addition, the extent and degree of atrophy and
   intestinal metaplasia were more prominent in the corpus lesser compared
   to the greater curvature (p=0.002 and p=0.0065, respectively). The
   frequency of distribution of H. pylon did not differ throughout both the
   corpus and antrum greater and lesser curvature. However, the degree of
   H. pylori colonization in the corpus was higher in the lesser than in
   the greater curvature. The interobserver agreement was significantly
   higher for corpus atrophy compared to antrum atrophy.
   Conclusions. These findings demonstrated that the more severe atrophic,
   metaplastic and inflammatory changes were observed in the lesser
   compared to the greater curvature of the stomach. In routine clinical
   settings, corpus and antral biopsies should be obtained from both lesser
   and greater curvature. Analysis of the incisura biopsy is also
   important.}},

Abstract = {{\textbackslash{}Ammonium perchlorate is the most widely employed
   oxidizer for composite solid propellants. When exposed to atmosphere, it
   absorbs moisture and agglomerates. It is usually vacuum dried in order
   to avoid this agglomeration. When ammonium perchlorate that has been
   exposed to atmosphere for a certain period of time, is used in making a
   composite solid propellant, the burning rate is different because of the
   change in particle size distribution due to its agglomeration. This
   change in burning rate will change the thrust-time profile from that of
   what it is designed for. As one goes to a finer ammonium perchlorate
   particle size this problem becomes more evident. Experimental studies
   aimed at reducing the agglomeration of ammonium perchlorate by coating
   it with activated charcoal. Ammonium perchlorate coated with 1\%
   activated charcoal showed almost no agglomeration, even when the
   particle size of ammonium perchlorate is approx. 1 mm. The burning rates
   also remained unchanged when ammonium perchlorate coated with 1\%
   activated charcoal was employed in propellant composition, after it has
   been exposed to the atmosphere for a period of 1 h.}},

   PMTCT centres in Nigeria. The intervention groups were exposed to one
   session of acceptance and commitment therapy with weekly value-based

   The control groups received only post-HIV test counselling. A total of
   132 participants (33 per site) were enrolled in the study from the two
   intervention and two control sites. In the pre-tests, the intervention
   and control groups did not differ significantly with regard to

Abstract = {{Fresh beef slices were marinated by immersion in marinades based on dry
   red wine, lime-tree honey, salt, spices and seasoning plants such as
   thyme (Thymus vulgaris), marjoram (Majorana hortensis), garlic (Allium
   sativum) and horseradish (Armoracia rusticana). Once marinated, meat
   pieces were vacuum packed and stored at 4C for 12 days. Experimental
   data indicated that marination of bovine Biceps femoris muscle in
   wine-based marinades with spices and seasoning plants addition
   significantly decreased (P < 0.05) cooking losses. A significant
   increase in tenderness (P < 0.05) was observed in the samples marinated
   compared with the control. The effect of marination on biceps femoris
   muscle was not significant (P > 0.05) on L{*}, a{*} and b{*} but
   significant on Mb (myoglobin), MMb (metmyoglobin) and MbO(2)
   (oxymyoglobin) percentages. Electrophoretic pattern of muscle proteins
   showed reduction of molecular weight and relative density (\%) of some
   protein fractions for marinated samples compared with the control.
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
   Meat quality can be defined as a combination of sensory characteristics
   and technological aspects, such as color, water-holding capacity,
   cooking losses and texture. Marinades based on dry red wine, lime-tree
   honey, salt, spices and seasoning plants might be used as a marinating
   agent for improving the tenderness of tough meat and decreasing cooking
   losses with no effect on meat color. It can be easily applied at
   household and industrial levels as an easy technique to improve meat
   tenderness. Improvement in tenderness will be of great value to both
   consumers and meat processors.}},

   spermatid-like structures, concomitant with a loss of histones and a

   injected into enucleated oocytes efficiently underwent protamine to
   maternal histone TH2B exchange and developed into normal blastocyst

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to assess the radiological impact of surface
   water and sediment around uranium mining sites 20 years after their
   closing. The areas under observations are 31 former classical
   underground uranium mining and exploratory sites in Bulgaria, named as
   objects. The extraction and processing of uranium ores in the Republic
   of Bulgaria were ended in 1992. To assess the radiological impact of
   radionuclides field expeditions were performed to sample water and
   bottom sediment. The migration of uranium through surface water was
   examined as one of the major pathways for contamination spread. The
   range of uranium concentration in water flowing from the mining sites
   was from 0.012 to 6.8 mgU l(-1) with a geometric mean of 0.192 mgU
   l(-1). The uranium concentrations in water downstream the mining sites
   were approximately 3 times higher than the background value (upstream).
   The concentrations of U-nat, Ra-226, Pb-210, and Th-232 in the sediment
   of downstream river were higher than those upstream by 3.4, 2.6, 2, and
   1.7 times, respectively. The distribution coefficient of uranium
   reflects its high mobility in most of the sites. In order to evaluate
   the impact on people as well as site prioritization for more detailed
   assessment and water management, screening dose assessments were done.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety
   of S-1 versus cisplatin (CDDP)+S-1 in patients with completely resected
   stage II and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer, and to identify predictive
   biomarkers whose expression in the tumors was significantly associated
   with patient outcome.
   Experimental Design: A total of 200 patients were randomly assigned to
   receive either S-1 (40 mg/m(2) twice per day) for 2 consecutive weeks
   repeated every 3 weeks for 1 year (S group) or CDDP (60 mg/m2) on day 1
   plus oral S-1 (40 mg/m2 twice per day) for 2 consecutive weeks repeated
   every 3 weeks for four cycles (CS group) within 8 weeks after surgery.
   The primary endpoints were relapse-free survival (RFS) at 2 years and
   identification of predictive biomarkers whose expressions have been
   reported to be associated with CDDP or fluoropyrimidine sensitivity.
   Results: The RFS rate at 2 years was 65.6\% (95\% confidence intervals;
   CI, 55.3-74.0\%) in the S group and 58.1\% (95\% CI, 47.7-67.2\%) in the
   CS group. The only gene with interaction of P < 0.05 was uridine
   monophosphate synthase (UMPS; P = 0.0348). The benefit that members of
   the S group had over members of the CS group was higher expression of
   UMPS. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that overexpression of
   UMPS enhanced the antitumor effect of fluoropyrimidine.
   Conclusions: Adjuvant S-1 monotherapy might be preferable to CDDP+S-1
   for patients with completely resected NSCLC. UMPS expression may define
   a patient subset that would benefit from long-term postoperative S-1
   monotherapy. (C) 2015 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we report a fluorescent probe based on a macrocyclic peptide
   scaffold that specifically stains EpCAM-expressing MCF7 cells. The
   14-mer macrocyclic peptide binding to the extracellular domain of EpCAM
   with a dissociation constant in the low nM range (1.7 nM) was discovered
   using the random non-standard peptide-integrated discovery system.
   Notably, this probe containing a fluorescence tag is less than 3000 Da
   in total and able to visualize nearly every live cell under high
   cell-density conditions, which was not achieved by the conventional mAb
   staining method. This suggests that the molecular probe based on the
   compact macrocyclic scaffold has great potentials as an imaging tool for
   the EpCAM biomarker as well as a delivery vehicle for drug conjugates.}},

Abstract = {{Wild barley has invaded wheat fields ever since flamprop-isopropyl was
   outdated in Iran. Newly developed herbicides such as sulfosulfuron or
   sulfosulfuron plus metsulfuron-methyl can control it at higher than
   recommended dosages, but causing significant wheat injury. Hence, two
   dose-response experiments were conducted to evaluate their efficacy when
   tank-mixed with thirteen different vegetable oils, at the Ferdowsi
   University of Mashhad, Iran, during 2013. Moreover, a wheat cultivar
   (Gaskogen) was also treated with effective dose of 90\% (ED90) of both
   herbicides (21.44 grams active ingredient (g ai) of sulfosulfuron ha(-1)
   and 41.95 g ai of sulfosulfuron plus metsulfuron-methyl ha(-1)) with and
   without each vegetable oil to check selectivity. Averaged over vegetable
   oils, the effective dose of 50\% (ED50) was decreased 2.6-and 3.0-fold
   with sulfosulfuron and sulfosulfuron plus metsulfuron-methyl,
   respectively. Among the evaluated vegetable oils, cottonseed and coconut
   oil were the best ones to enhance the efficacy of both herbicides. The
   castor oil had the least effect. A negative correlation was observed
   between the efficiency of vegetable oils and its unsaturated/saturated
   fatty acids ratio. No phytotoxic effect on wheat was observed when these
   herbicides were applied with or without the vegetable oils.}},

Abstract = {{Background:The Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine
   (IDEATel) project demonstrated that a telemedicine intervention can
   improve glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure control. The focus of the
   current study was to evaluate factors associated with primary care
   providers' (PCPs') decision on whether to follow recommendations from
   the remote diabetes team in Upstate New York.Materials and Methods:In
   the intervention group, diabetes educators videoconferenced with
   patients monthly to download and review glucose and blood pressure
   readings, diabetes-related issues, and laboratory data. These were
   reviewed with an endocrinologist, and recommendations to change therapy
   were sent to the PCPs. At annual visits, participants completed the
   Diabetes Symptom Checklist-Type 2 symptom severity score and Impact of
   Telemedicine surveys.Results:Factors that increase the acceptance rate
   of IDEATel recommendations included longer time in the study (p=0.0052),
   changing medication dose as opposed to starting or stopping a medication
   (p<0.0001), adjusting glucose-lowering agents compared with
   antihypertensive or antilipid medications (p<0.0001), higher total
   Diabetes Symptom Checklist-Type 2 symptom severity score (p=0.045),
   greater number of glucose readings submitted by participants (p=0.014),
   and high score on surveys measuring impact of telemedicine on patient's
   knowledge, adherence, and satisfaction
   (p=0.0023).Conclusions:Recommendations for change in glycemic control
   medications, delivered remotely by a diabetes team to PCPs, were better
   accepted over time. Results support the use of a team-based telemedicine
   program to help PCPs improve diabetes care.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma medicine utilizes the combined interaction of plasma produced
   reactive components. These are reactive atoms, molecules, ions,
   metastable species, and radiation. Here, ultraviolet (UV, 100-400 nm)
   and, in particular, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV, 10-200 nm) radiation
   generated by an atmospheric pressure argon plasma jet were investigated
   regarding plasma emission, absorption in a humidified atmosphere and in
   solutions relevant for plasma medicine. The energy absorption was
   obtained for simple solutions like distilled water (dH(2)O) or ultrapure
   water and sodium chloride (NaCl) solution as well as for more complex
   ones, for example, Rosewell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI 1640) cell
   culture media. As moderate stable reactive oxygen species, hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2) was studied. Highly reactive oxygen radicals, namely,
   superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)) and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center
   dot), were investigated by the use of electron paramagnetic resonance
   spectroscopy. All species amounts were detected for three different
   treatment cases: Plasma jet generated VUV and UV radiation, plasma jet
   generated UV radiation without VUV part, and complete plasma jet
   including all reactive components additionally to VUV and UV radiation.
   It was found that a considerable amount of radicals are generated by the
   plasma generated photoemission. From the experiments, estimation on the
   low hazard potential of plasma generated VUV radiation is discussed. (C)

Title = {{Characterizing Far-infrared Laser Emissions and the Measurement of Their
   Frequencies}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{106}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The generation and subsequent measurement of far-infrared radiation has
   found numerous applications in high-resolution spectroscopy, radio
   astronomy, and Terahertz imaging. For about 45 years, the generation of
   coherent, far-infrared radiation has been accomplished using the
   optically pumped molecular laser. Once far-infrared laser radiation is
   detected, the frequencies of these laser emissions are measured using a
   three-laser heterodyne technique. With this technique, the unknown
   frequency from the optically pumped molecular laser is mixed with the
   difference frequency between two stabilized, infrared reference
   frequencies. These reference frequencies are generated by independent
   carbon dioxide lasers, each stabilized using the fluorescence signal
   from an external, low pressure reference cell. The resulting beat
   between the known and unknown laser frequencies is monitored by a
   metal-insulator-metal point contact diode detector whose output is
   observed on a spectrum analyzer. The beat frequency between these laser
   emissions is subsequently measured and combined with the known reference
   frequencies to extrapolate the unknown far-infrared laser frequency. The
   resulting one-sigma fractional uncertainty for laser frequencies
   measured with this technique is +/- 5 parts in 10(7). Accurately
   determining the frequency of far-infrared laser emissions is critical as
   they are often used as a reference for other measurements, as in the
   high-resolution spectroscopic investigations of free radicals using
   laser magnetic resonance. As part of this investigation,
   difluoromethane, CH2F2, was used as the far-infrared laser medium. In
   all, eight far-infrared laser frequencies were measured for the first
   time with frequencies ranging from 0.359 to 1.273 THz. Three of these
   laser emissions were discovered during this investigation and are
   reported with their optimal operating pressure, polarization with
   respect to the CO2 pump laser, and strength.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{2027-2035}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Federal subsidies for health insurance premiums sold through the
   Marketplaces are tied to the cost of the benchmark plan, the
   second-lowest-cost silver plan. According to economic theory, the
   presence of more competitors should lead to lower premiums, implying
   smaller federal outlays for premium subsidies. The long-term impact of
   the Affordable Care Act on government spending will depend on the cost
   of these premium subsidies over time, with insurer participation and the
   level of competition likely to influence those costs. We studied insurer
   participation and premiums during the first two years of the
   Marketplaces. We found that the addition of a single insurer in a county
   was associated with a 1.2 percent lower premium for the average silver
   plan and a 3.5 percent lower premium for the benchmark plan in the
   federally run Marketplaces. We found that the effect of insurer entry
   was muted after two or three additional entrants. These findings suggest
   that increased insurer participation in the federally run Marketplaces
   reduces federal payments for premium subsidies.}},

Abstract = {{The literature concerning obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) indicates
   that obsessions frequently imply negative evaluative beliefs regarding
   the self. The construct of the feared self has been used to describe the
   set of harmful attributes an individual worries they may possess. This
   study aimed to partially replicate previous research that demonstrated a
   relationship between feared-self beliefs and obsessional doubt in
   OCD-relevant contexts. The relationship between perceptions of personal
   responsibility and associated levels of doubt was also examined.
   Nonclinical participants (N = 221; 155 female; M-age = 26.4, SD = 9.2)
   were presented with vignettes related to checking and non OCD-relevant
   themes, which quantified doubt through the presentation of alternating
   reality-based (i.e., sensory) and possibility-based information. Of the
   total sample, 112 participants were randomly allocated to a personally
   relevant condition (in which the action implied in the vignettes was
   completed by the reader), and 109 were allocated to a second,
   other-relevant, condition (in which the action implied in the vignettes
   was completed by a proximal other). The results provided support for
   reasoning processes implicated in OCD, suggesting that feared-self
   beliefs may partially contribute to heightened levels of doubt in
   response to possibility vs. reality-based information in OCD-relevant
   contexts. Personal relevance contributed to greater baseline levels of
   doubt, but not to greater responses to the reality- and
   possibility-based statements accompanying the OCD-relevant vignette.
   Implications for theory and future research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the large data analysis of the real-world driving
   cycles and studies the effect of different driving styles on the
   electric vehicle (EV) battery performance and aging. For this study, a
   MATLAB-based software tool, real EV cycle (REV-cycle) analyzer, is
   developed. The real-world driving data are recorded from the I-80
   highway, CA, USA. In this study, driving cycles are classified into
   three styles as aggressive, mild, and gentle driving based on their
   average acceleration. Also, two standard driving cycles (EUDC and HWFET)
   are simulated by the software and the results are compared. The results
   show that the real driving cycles are very different from the standard
   cycles. Also, it is observed that the traffic flow affects the driving
   style, as the drivers tend to drive more aggressive during the light
   traffic hours of the highway, while the heavy traffic limits the
   driver's aggressive behavior. On the other hand, the driving style has
   considerable effect on the energy consumption and the battery aging. The
   aggressive driving style demands higher average power from the battery
   compared to the mild and gentle driving style. From the aging point of
   view, the aggressive driving style leads to higher Crate demand from the
   battery and it expedited the capacity fade process compared to the mild
   and gentle driving styles.}},

Abstract = {{Background: IL-17/IL-23 axis plays an important role in the pathogenesis
   of several autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune
   encephalomyelitis (EAE) and multiple sclerosis (MS). The
   immunomodulatory properties of ginger are reported in previous studies.
   Objective: To evaluate the effects of ginger extract on the expression
   of IL-17 and IL-23 in a model of EAE. Methods: EAE was induced in
   C57BL/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein
   and then treated with PBS or ginger extracts, from day +3 to +30. At day
   31, mice were scarificed and the expression of IL-17 and IL-23 mRNA in
   spinal cord were determined by using real time-PCR. The serum levels of
   cytokines were measured by ELISA. Results: The mRNA expression of IL-17,
   IL-23 P19 and IL-23 P40 in CNS and serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23 were
   significantly higher in PBS-treated EAE mice than non-EAE group
   (p<0.003, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). In 200
   mg/kg ginger-treated EAE mice the mRNA expression of IL-17, P19 and P40
   in CNS and serum IL-23 levels were significantly decreased as compared
   to PBS-treated EAE mice (p<0.05, p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.05,
   respectively). Moreover, 300 mg/kg ginger-treated EAE group had
   significantly lower expression of IL-17, P19 and P40 in CNS and lower
   serum IL-17 and IL-23 levels than PBS-treated EAE group (p<0.02,
   p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.03 and p<0.004, respectively). Conclusion: Ginger
   extract reduces the expression of IL-17 and IL-23 in EAE mice. The
   therapeutic potential of ginger for treatment of MS could be considered
   in further studies.}},

Abstract = {{Global demand for petroleum keeps increasing while traditional supplies
   decline. One alternative to the use of conventional crude oils is the
   utilization of Canadian bitumen. Raw bitumen is a dense, viscous,
   semi-liquid that is diluted with lighter crude oil to permit its
   transport through pipelines to terminals where it can then be shipped to
   global markets. When spilled, it naturally weathers to its original form
   and becomes dense enough to sink in aquatic systems. This severely
   limits oil spill recovery and remediation options. Here we report on the
   application of charred hay as a method for modifying the surface
   behavior of bitumen in aquatic environments. Waste or surplus hay is
   abundant in North America. Its surface can easily be modified through
   charring and/or chemical treatment. We have characterized the modified
   and charred hay using solid-state NMR, contact angle measurements and
   infrared spectroscopy. Tests of these materials to treat spilled bitumen
   in model aquatic systems have been undertaken. Our results indicate that
   bitumen spills on water will retain their buoyancy for longer periods
   after treatment with charred hay, or charred hay coated with calcium
   oxide, improving recovery options.}},

Abstract = {{Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) with selective layered surface were
   utilized for the potential allowing the original molecule to be tagged
   as a biologically active chiral entity in a biological cancer milieu.
   The general features of the particles consisted of different monomeric
   compositions for the copolymerization deposited on the surfaces. We
   found that the addition of an almost equimolar ratio of two crosslinkers
   enabled thalidomide to be bound 70\% and prolonged release of the R-form
   to a greater extent than that achieved using a single crosslinker. The
   effect of the altered surface on the ability of the enantiomers and
   racemic thalidomide to cross a lipid bilayer and the optical properties
   of a quantum dot has been studied. These chirally imprints provided the
   controlled interfacial interactions at the self-assembly site, coupled
   to the electronic reactions, related to probing the recognition events
   in the apoptosis cancer cells. This result revealed the
   three-dimensional fluorescence imaging for evaluation drug release that
   give rise a much greater decrease of cell viability of the Caco-2 cells.
   Furthermore, the increased hydrophobicity on the surface enhanced
   fluorescence due to an effective complex with three-dimensional shape of
   the active site inside the cavity. Evidently, the endogenous components
   affected the interacting of the albumin capable of the activation of
   immune system on the cell allowed discriminating a form of thalidomide.
   The results indicated that the thalidomide-tagged protein on
   enantiomorphs selective-MIPs optimising its cancer delivery application,
   yet promoted the identification of target-ligand interactions for
   pharmaceutical effect and the toxicities of thalidomide enantiomers. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, pure mode I, pure mode II and mixed mode fracture
   behavior of an epoxy were investigated. Specifically, the mixed mode
   values of fracture toughness and critical strain energy release rate
   (CSERR) were measured. Specimens were subjected to mixed mode loading
   using compact tension shear (CTS) test. Some experimental modifications
   were found to be necessary to eliminate rotation and ensure crack
   propagation at the notch when testing epoxy specimens at high mode II
   loading. A failure criterion for the mixed mode loading of polymer is
   developed and its predictions are compared with the experimental
   results. The crack propagation direction in epoxy was investigated in
   this research as well. A detailed study of failure mechanisms on the
   fracture surface was performed. The results indicate that the increase
   in the value of toughness can be directly related to the fracture

Abstract = {{The efficacy of steroids and immunosuppressive treatments in idiopathic
   nephrotic syndrome (INS) hints at the implication of immune cells in the
   pathophysiology of the disease. Toll-like receptor (TLR) dysfunctions
   are involved in many kidney diseases of immune origin, but remain little
   described in INS. We investigated the expression and function of TLRs in
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of INS children, including 28
   in relapse, 23 in remission and 40 controls. No child had any sign of
   infection, but a higher Epstein-Barr virus viral load was measured in
   the PBMC of relapsing patients. TLR-3 expression was increased in B
   cells only during INS remission. There was a negative correlation
   between proteinuria and TLR-3 expression in total and the main subsets
   of PBMC from INS patients. The expression of TLR-8 was also increased in
   both CD4(+) T cells and B cells in INS remission. There was a negative
   correlation between proteinuria and TLR-8 expression in total PBMC,
   CD4(+) T cells and B cells of INS patients. Nevertheless, TLR-3 and
   TLR-8 expression was normalized in all PBMC subsets in an additional
   group of 15 INS patients in remission with B cell repletion after
   rituximab therapy. Paradoxically, interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3
   transactivation was increased in PBMC of all INS patients. In-vitro
   secretion of IFN- and interleukin 6 were increased spontaneously in PBMC
   of INS remission patients, whereas PBMC from all INS patients displayed
   an impaired IFN- secretion after TLR-3 stimulation. Thus, TLR-3 pathway
   dysfunctions may be closely involved in INS pathogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is used in myriad
   applications because of its speed of execution, ease of manufacturing
   and usability. In the domain of critical infrastructure protection, RFID
   systems are often used to identify people, objects and vehicles that
   enter restricted areas, and to track packages and cargo containers.
   Relay attacks are known to pose serious threats to the authentication
   protocols used in RFID systems. In 2014, Urien and Piramuthu proposed an
   authentication protocol that simultaneously uses a temperature sensor
   and a distance bounding scheme to protect RFID systems from relay
   attacks. They claim that the authentication protocol provides the
   maximum level of security against relay attacks as well as against the
   related terrorist fraud and distance fraud attacks. This paper shows
   that the Urien-Piramuthu authentication protocol is vulnerable to all
   three attacks with attacker success probabilities of 100\%, implying
   that the protocol cannot protect RFID systems from the attacks.}},

   launch coronal mass ejections into the interplanetary medium, and as
   such, are one of the main drivers of space weather. After briefly
   reviewing the main characteristics of solar flares, we summarise the
   processes that can account for the build-up and release of energy during
   their evolution. In particular, we focus on the development of recent 3D
   numerical simulations that explain many of the observed flare features.
   These simulations can also provide predictions of the dynamical
   evolution of coronal and photospheric magnetic field. Here we present a
   few observational examples that, together with numerical modelling,
   point to the underlying physical mechanisms of the eruptions.}},

Abstract = {{The work of Bessy (1990) has showed the transformation of fitness
   centers from a masculine space to a more feminine space. If there were
   an initial commercial logic to this change, it also occurred in step
   with the successful liberation of the female body on one hand, and, on
   the other, their adhesion to a space open to a free selection of sports
   practices.
   These ``spas{''} have gradually evolved into gyms that offer new,
   diverse, trendy, and fashionable activities that suit all ages. Their
   public has indeed evolved as they attract ``older{''} women. The
   expectation of living life in good health has indeed increased
   significantly in the last 20 years (INSEE, 2010). The concern with aging
   well (Feillet, 2012), the desire to preserve one's image (and body) for
   oneself and others (Corbin, Courtine Vigarello, 2005), the need to
   appear ``forever young{''} (Amadieu, 1990), the weight of the cult of
   youth in the media (Kaufmann, 2001)-to name a few factors among many-
   have led to a democratization of fitness for all ages to meet concerns
   about the body and its shape.
   In a few years, fitness has become a ``tool{''} in the fight against
   aging and, for women concerned with meeting prescribed social norms, in
   preventing it.}},

Journal = {{BIOINTERPHASES}},

Abstract = {{In the development of bioactive coatings on biomaterials, it is
   essential to characterize the successful fabrication and the uniformity
   of intended coatings by sensitive surface analytical techniques, so as
   to ensure reliable interpretation of observed biointerfacial responses.
   This can, however, be challenging when small bioactive molecules are
   grafted onto biomaterials surfaces at sub-and near-monolayer densities.
   Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) provides the
   required sensitivity, but ion signals from small grafted molecules may
   still be dominated by fragment ions from the underlying polymer. In such
   cases, multivariate analysis provides valuable enhancement of spectral
   data, as illustrated here by examples comprising the surface grafting of
   bioactive serrulatane molecules, the peptide GRGDSP, the oligonucleotide
   15-thymidine, and the antifungal compound Amphotericin B. The authors
   also show how ToF-SIMS plus principal component analysis can distinguish
   between covalent grafting and physisorption of the antibiotics
   caspofungin and micafungin. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Informal caregiving for cancer patients is associated with substantial
   costs and negative health impact. This study investigated the health,
   humanistic and economic consequences of caring for lung cancer patients
   in five European Union (EU) countries.
   The study included respondents to the 2010/2011 EU National Health and
   Wellness Survey from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United
   Kingdom who self-reported being caregivers of a relative with lung
   cancer (n = 107) or non-caregivers (n = 103,868). Bivariate and
   multivariable analyses tested the association of caregiving with
   stress-related comorbidities; health-related quality of life (HRQoL),
   using the Short Form-12; healthcare resource use; and work
   productivity/activity impairment, using the Work Productivity and
   Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire. Costs were based on
   absenteeism and presenteeism rates.
   Caregivers versus non-caregivers had significantly higher odds of
   depression, insomnia, headache and gastrointestinal symptoms, and worse
   HRQoL. Caregivers reported significantly higher rates of
   presenteeism-related, overall work and activity impairment; higher odds
   of impairment across WPAI measures; and higher annual indirect costs
   with presenteeism and overall work impairment.
   Caregiving for lung cancer patients is associated with significant
   health/work impairments and costs, highlighting a need for increased,
   personalized caregiver support.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of data on the soil component of pastures in Kashmir Himalaya is a
   strong limitation to assess the impact of transhumant livestock on it.
   During present study the data has been raised for physico-chemical
   properties of such soils among different grazing intensities designated
   as lightly grazed (LG), moderately grazed (MG) and heavily grazed (HG).
   Besides, physical properties like bulk density (BD) and texture,
   chemical properties like (OC), total N (TN), P, K, Ca, S, Mg, pH and
   electrical conductivity (EC), which are a function of these cations were
   worked out. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) and other
   relevant techniques have been used to analyze the various parameters of
   soil, which are mostly effected by grazing. Soil OC, Ca and Mg content
   were observed to decrease with increase in the grazing intensity at
   sampling depths 0-10 cm. Conversely, total N, P, S and K showed an
   increase in the total concentration in areas with increased grazing
   pressures. The uneven grazing intensity (an inherent feature of a
   transhumant grazing system) makes the soils susceptible for degradation.
   We need to find the proper balance between light to heavy grazing
   intensity through proper grazing management and in some cases using
   judicious herding to distribute livestock.}},

Abstract = {{Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), an ancient and commercially important
   fruit of both tropical and subtropical countries, is extensively
   cultivated around the Mediterranean and other parts of world including
   India. Regarded as a fruit of paradise, is one among the major fruit
   crops of arid zone. In India, it is regarded as a ``vital cash crop{''},
   grown in an area of 1.5 lakh ha with a production of 11.0 lakh tons. The
   fruits are immensely important as they are delicious, have high food
   value and rich in carbohydrates, calcium, iron, sulphur and vitamin-c
   and citric acid. Pomegranate fruits are known to posses pharmaceutical
   and therapeutic properties. It is a symbol of health, fertility, eternal
   life and also being valued as medicinal plant to treat diabetes, cancer,
   hypertension, gastric inflammation and heart and kidney diseases. Hence,
   they are consumed by many people of the world. The crop is becoming more
   popular among the growers and attained a status of commercial crop. The
   diseases are also spreading faster and becoming a major limiting factor
   in attaining high yield. Pomegranate is suffering from several
   economically important diseases like anthracnose, caused by
   Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. and Sacc. which has become
   a potentially destructive disease both under orchard and post-harvest
   storage conditions. In severely affected orchards, defoliation, dropping
   of flowers and fruit resulting in drastic reduction of fruit yield and
   quality while, after harvest it reduces the market value of fruits.
   Propagules of pathogen cause spots and decay the fruit. Management study
   under field conditions revealed that the treatments with foliar sprays
   of carbendazim + mancozeb(0.3 \%) and propiconazole (0.1 \%) reduced the
   disease drastically with high yield and good quality fruits. With an aim
   to search for resistance genotypes against anthracnose, 19 genotypes
   were evaluated under in vitro conditions using detached leaf technique.
   Among them Ganesh, Araktha and Kesar found to be susceptible and none of
   them were resistant. Thus the present study revealed that, for better
   quality of fruits it is necessary to manage the anthracnose effectively
   both in orchards and also after harvest.}},

Abstract = {{Breath analysis is a non-invasive technique used in clinical
   laboratories for the identification of several morbid conditions. Renal
   failure patients can be distinguished by observing the degree of ammonia

   dialysis. This study proposes a system that uses metal oxide
   semiconductor sensors, which is capable of detecting ammonia from
   exhaled breath and identify whether the patient has been subjected to
   renal failure. Breath samples are gathered using a specially designed
   breath collecting tube and the steady-state responses are recorded after
   the samples have been passed through sensors TGS2444, MQ135, MQ137, and
   TGS826. From the steady-state response, geometric features are extracted
   and the support vector machine technique is used for classifying the
   pre- and post-dialysis groups. The results shown an accuracy of 88 \%

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{Voltage unbalance (VU) management of power systems requires the
   development of well researched engineering practices to maintain
   acceptable VU levels while utilising the total VU absorption capacity of
   the power system. In this regard, IEC/TR 61000-3-13:2008 prescribes a VU
   emission allocation methodology based on a stochastic approach which
   uses a general summation law in order to aggregate numerous sources of
   unbalance to take into account their random variations. On the other
   hand, recent deterministic studies on VU emission assessment at the
   post-connection stage of unbalanced installations present a complex VU
   factor based approach to determine constituent components of the
   post-connection VU emission at a point of evaluation. The primary
   objective of the work presented in this paper is to develop statistical
   approaches for compliance assessment using the outcomes of the
   deterministic methodologies on VU emission assessment, thus refining the
   existing general summation law. A revised general summation law is
   established, introducing weighting factors to evaluate the influences
   made by different sources of unbalance separately, in order to assess VU
   emission in radial networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We use a central place forager model for shellfish processing to
   understand Middle Holocene (75503600 cal BP) human settlement patterns
   on California's Northern Channel Islands. This period was associated
   with increasing sedentism and special purpose sites. We examine the
   processing and transport costs of two high-ranked shellfish species
   collected during the Middle Holocene, red abalone (Haliotis rufescens)
   and California mussel (Mytilus californianus), and how these costs
   influence archaeological assemblages at coastal and interior
   settlements. Experimental data and the biology of these species suggest
   that red abalones are less likely than mussels to be transported long
   distances (similar to 2 km) without field processing. Consistent with
   these expectations, coastal red abalone midden sites (CA-SRI-109 and
   -338) are dominated by large red abalone shells and California mussels
   are most abundant at contemporaneous inland sites (e.g., CA-SRI-50).
   Large coastal settlement sites (CA-SRI-5, -19, -116, and -821) had the
   highest overall shellfish diversity. A stable oxygen isotope study
   suggests that special purpose sites were occupied seasonally and large
   coastal settlements were more likely to be inhabited year-round. Our
   study suggests that transportation and processing costs of food
   resources were important variables in the development of early
   hunter-gatherer settlement patterns. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{While practice is paramount to achieve fluency and accuracy in a foreign

   language practice it can offer to its students.
   The initiative discussed here aims to address this issue by providing
   peer-led discussion groups in languages in a systematic manner. For the
   past three years, a team of language practitioners at the University of
   Limerick, Ireland have developed a programme whereby groups of native
   speakers receive training before facilitating discussion groups and/or
   one-to-one sessions.
   In this study, we will first present an overview of the initiative. We
   will then focus on the training offered to the peer-facilitators. The
   main principles of the training package will be explained: it seeks to
   prepare the facilitators to select relevant topics, to focus on language
   fluency and to provide constructive feedback to participating students.
   Finally, we will draw some conclusions from our experience, provide some
   recommendations and discuss the value of peer-supported activities to

Abstract = {{Many countries implement micronutrient powder (MNP) programmes to
   improve the nutritional status of young children. Little is known about
   the predictors of MNP coverage for different delivery models. We
   describe MNP coverage of an infant and young child feeding and MNP
   intervention for children aged 6-23 months comparing two delivery models
   piloted in rural Nepal: distributing MNPs either by female community
   health volunteers (FCHVs) or at health facilities (HFs). Cross-sectional
   household cluster surveys were conducted in four pilot districts among
   mothers of children 6-23 months after starting MNP distribution. FCHVs
   in each cluster were also surveyed. We used logistic regression to
   describe predictors of initial coverage (obtaining a batch of 60 MNP
   sachets) at 3 months and repeat coverage (>= 2 times coverage among
   eligible children) at 15 months after project launch. At 15 months,
   initial and repeat coverage were higher in the FCHV model, although no
   differences were observed at 3 months. Attending an FCHV-led mothers'
   group meeting where MNP was discussed increased odds of any coverage in
   both models at 3 months and of repeat coverage in the HF model at 15
   months. Perceiving >= 1 positive effects in the child increased odds of
   repeat coverage in both delivery models. A greater portion of FCHV
   volunteers from the FCHV model vs. the HF model reported increased
   burden at 3 and 15 months (not statistically significant). Designing MNP
   programmes that maximise coverage without overburdening the system can
   be challenging and more than one delivery model may be needed.}},

Abstract = {{Compromised skin integrity of farmed Atlantic salmon, commonly occurring
   under low temperature and stressful conditions, has major impacts on
   animal welfare and economic productivity. Even fish with minimal scale
   loss and minor wounds can suffer from secondary infections, causing
   downgrading and mortalities. Wound healing is a complex process, where
   water temperature and nutrition play key roles. In this study, Atlantic
   salmon (260 g) were held at different water temperatures (4 or 12 A
   degrees C) and fed three different diets for 10 weeks, before artificial
   wounds were inflicted and the wound healing process monitored for 2
   weeks. The fish were fed either a control diet, a diet supplemented with
   zinc (Zn) or a diet containing a combination of functional ingredients
   in addition to Zn. The effect of diet was assessed through subjective
   and quantitative skin histology and the transcription of skin-associated
   chemokines. Histology confirmed that wound healing was faster at 12 A
   degrees C. The epidermis was more organised, and image analyses of
   digitised skin slides showed that fish fed diets with added Zn had a
   significantly larger area of the epidermis covered by mucous cells in
   the deeper layers after 2 weeks, representing more advanced healing
   progression. Constitutive levels of the newly described chemokines,
   herein named CK 11A, B and C, confirmed their preferential expression in
   skin compared to other tissues. Contrasting modulation profiles at 4 and
   12 A degrees C were seen for all three chemokines during the wound
   healing time course, while the Zn-supplemented diets significantly
   increased the expression of CK 11A and B during the first 24 h of the
   healing phase.}},

Title = {{Self-assessed health, perceived stress and non-participation in breast
   cancer screening: A Danish cohort study}},
Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{392-398}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Population-based cancer screening is offered in many
   countries to detect early stages of cancer and reduce mortality.
   Screening efficiency and equality is susceptible due to a group of
   non-participants. We investigated associations between self-assessed
   health, perceived stress and subsequent non-participation in breast
   cancer screening.
   Methods. This population-based cohort study included 4512 women who had
   participated in a Health Survey in 2006 and who were also the target
   group (aged 50-69 years) for the first organised breast cancer screening
   programme -3 years later in the Central Denmark Region in 2008-2009.
   Results. A U-shaped association was observed for physical health
   assessment as women with the highest (PR = 1.28, 95\% CI: 1.06-1.55),
   and the lowest (PR = 1.41, 95\% CI: 1.18-1.68) physical health scores
   were less likely to participate in the programme than women with
   physical health scores in the middle range. Women with low mental health
   assessment were more likely not to participate than women with mental
   health scores in the middle range (PR = 1.44, 95\% CI: 1.22-1.69).
   Higher non-participation propensity was also observed for women with the
   highest perceived stress scores (PR=1.27, 95\% CI: 1.07-1.51) compared
   with women scoring in the middle range.
   Conclusions. Women with highest and lowest self-assessed physical
   health, with lowest mental health or highest perceived stress were
   significantly more likely not to participate in breast cancer screening
   2-3 years later than women who reported average health. Interventions
   targeting these groups may promote equal participation in future breast
   cancer screening programmes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   ((R)-4-((R)-3-amino-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoyl)-3-(tert-butoxymet
   hyl)-piperazin-2-one), is a new dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor used
   for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. The in vitro metabolic
   pathways of evogliptin were identified in human hepatocytes, liver
   microsomes, and liver S9 fractions using liquid chromatography-Orbitrap
   mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Five metabolites of
   evogliptin-4-oxoevogliptin (M1), 4(S)-hydroxyevogliptin (M2),
   4(R)-hydroxyevogliptin (M3), 4(S)-hydroxyevogliptin glucuronide (M4),
   and evogliptin N-sulfate (M5)were identified in human liver preparations
   by comparison with authentic standards. We characterized the cytochrome
   P450 (CYP) enzymes responsible for evogliptin hydroxylation to
   4(S)-hydroxyevogliptin (M2) and 4(R)-hydroxyevogliptin (M3) and the UGT
   enzymes responsible for glucuronidation of 4(S)-hydroxyevogliptin (M2)
   to 4(S)-hydroxy-evogliptin glucuronide (M4). CYP3A4/5 played the major
   role in the hydroxylation of evogliptin to 4(S)-hydroxyevogliptin (M2)
   and 4(R)-hydroxyevogliptin (M3). Glucuronidation of
   4(S)-hydroxy-evogliptin (M2) to 4(S)-hydroxyevogliptin glucuronide (M4)
   was catalyzed by the enzymes UGT2B4 and UGT2B7. These results suggest
   that the interindividual variability in the metabolism of evogliptin in
   humans is a result of the genetic polymorphism of the CYP and UGT
   enzymes responsible for evogliptin metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Bisphosphonates are effective for the treatment of osteoporosis despite
   recent reports of safety concerns such as atypical femur fracture. We
   conducted an ecological analysis of relevant media reports, oral
   bisphosphonate use, and fracture outcomes in the United States. Trends
   in media reports and public interest of bisphosphonates were quantified
   using data from Google Trends. Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel
   Survey (MEPS) and the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) were used to
   estimate the trends in oral bisphosphonate use among patients aged 55
   years and older and hospitalizations for intertrochanteric and
   subtrochanteric fractures, respectively. These trends in the prevalence
   of oral bisphosphonate use and the age-adjusted incidence rate of
   intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures were examined from 1996
   to 2012. A series of spikes in Internet search activity for alendronate
   (Fosamax) occurred between 2006 and 2010 immediately following media
   reports of safety concerns. Oral bisphosphonate use declined by greater
   than 50\% between 2008 and 2012 (p < 0.001) after increasing use for
   more than a decade. The decline was more common in patients with lower
   education levels. Intertrochanteric hip fractures declined from 1996
   through 2006 (p < 0.001) and continued to decline from 2008 to 2012 (p <
   0.05). Subtrochanteric and diaphyseal fractures showed a steady and
   significant increase from 2002 to 2011 (p < 0.05). However, the
   incidence decreased from a peak of 30.5 per 100,000 in 2011 to 26.7 per
   100,000 in 2012. The plateauing and subsequent decline in oral
   bisphosphonate use since 2006 coincided with reports of safety concerns
   of bisphosphonates, despite the fact that U.S. Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) and American Society of Bone and Mineral Research
   (ASBMR) reports did not recommend any safety restrictions on their use.
   This decline in oral bisphosphonate use was followed by the decline in
   the incidence of subtrochanteric and diaphyseal fractures. (C) 2015

   detection performance that is very close to that of the conventional
   tree search equalizers (which employ the QRD-M or sphere decoding
   algorithm), but with a much lower complexity. In addition, the proposed
   algorithm performs significantly better than the decision-feedback
   equalizer, with only a modest increase in complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Single nucleotide polymorphisms of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) have
   been reported as markers for susceptibility to infectious diseases in
   humans and livestock. The present study was to determine the genetic
   variation of this cytokine in six carp strains. Among the sampled
   individuals, a total of 13 SNPs, including eight in introns and five in
   coding regions, were identified at intron 5, exon 6, intron 6 and exon
   7. Three positions of 1700, 1733 and 1934 resulted in variable amino
   acid changes with Phe to Tyr, Pro to Leu and Lys to Asn, respectively.
   Five positions with minor allele frequency (MAF) were larger than 0.05.
   Among 13 SNPs, eight positions of allele frequency and ten positions of
   genotypic frequency showed significant differences between some
   populations. The genotype distributions of the 13 SNPs were consistent
   with the assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with the

Abstract = {{Toxoplasmosis is fatal in the immunocompromised individuals such as
   cancer patients with chemotherapy. Clinical toxoplasmosis in cancer
   patients is a great public health concern in China. We performed this
   meta-analysis to assess the seroprevalence and odds ratios (ORs) of
   Toxoplasma gondii in Chinese population with cancer compared with those
   without.
   A methodical literature search was conducted with the help of the
   PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Embase, Chinese Web of Knowledge, Wanfang, and
   Chongqing VIP database. Case-control studies published from their
   inception until April 2015, reporting the seroprevalence of T. gondii in
   Chinese population with cancer, were covered as well. The nonweighted
   prevalence, pooled random-effects estimates of ORs, and 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs) were all calculated.
   Nineteen studies including 4493 cases and 6797 controls were
   incorporated in the meta-analysis. The overall seroprevalence of T.
   gondii was higher in population with cancer compared with those without
   ((20.59\% vs 6.31\%, P<0.001; OR 3.90, 95\% CI 3.00-5.07). The OR of T.
   gondii in cancer patients is further subgrouped according to publication
   year, sample size, and diagnostic methods. The pooled OR estimates were
   4.80 (95\% CI 2.57-8.99) from 1991 to 1999, 4.96 (95\% CI 3.03-8.12)
   during 2000 to 2005, and 2.94 (95\% CI 2.46-3.50) during 2006 to 2015.
   The pooled OR estimates were 6.16 (95\% CI 3.87-9.78) when the sample
   size was below 400, 5.37 (95\% CI 3.84-7.53) when the sample size was
   between 400 and 500, and 2.58 (95\% CI 2.17-3.07) when the sample size
   was above 500. The pooled OR estimates were 5.50 (95\% CI 3.98-7.62) by
   using indirect hemagglutination assay method, and 3.15 (95\% CI
   2.67-3.72) by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.
   The meta-analysis study found Chinese population with cancer had higher
   seroprevalence rates of T. gondii compared with those without.}},

Abstract = {{Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) has gained large popularity in
   recent years, although the choice of whether to preserve the spleen has
   remained inconsistent. The aim of our study was to report our
   experiences with LDP and to provide evidence for the safety of the
   operative technique and an evaluation index of splenic function. We
   retrospectively evaluated all LDPs performed at our institution between
   March 2008 and February 2012. Cases were divided into a laparoscopic
   spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (LSPDP) group (n = 14) and an
   LDP with splenectomy (LDPS) group (n = 19). Parametric and nonparametric
   statistical analyses were used to compare perioperative and oncologic
   outcomes. Demographic characteristics, operating time, length of stay,
   estimated blood loss, transfusion requirement, pathologic diagnosis, and
   complication rate were similar between groups. Patients who underwent
   LDPS tended to have larger masses and lower pancreatic fistula rates,
   but these differences were not significant. White blood cell (WBC)
   counts were significantly higher in the LDPS group than in the LSPDP
   group on postoperative days 1 and 7. To avoid splenectomy-associated
   complications, preservation of the spleen and especially the splenic
   vessels are preferred. This procedure can be performed safely and
   feasibly. Lower postoperative WBC counts may imply better splenic
   function.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, the impact of self-heating effect (SHE) on hot carrier
   degradation (HCD) in multiple-fin silicon-on-insulator (SOI) FinFETs was
   investigated. First, the ac conductance method has been utilized to
   extract the thermal resistance (Rth) of SOI FinFETs with different fin
   numbers. Then, both dc and ac stresses are applied on the gate and drain
   of transistors with the source grounded to characterize the HCD. It is
   found that the device with large fin number demonstrates
   high-temperature rise caused by SHE, which results in the enhanced
   generation of oxide bulk trapped charges. Thus, the SHE aggravates the
   HCD significantly. The influence of SHE on HCD is mitigated when the
   frequency of ac stress is above 10 MHz. Therefore, special attention to
   the SHE on HCD must be paid for accurate HCD prediction in FinFETs.}},

Abstract = {{Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) is the most popular
   technology for EGFR gene mutation analysis in China. Cutoff Ct or Delta
   Ct values were used to differentiate low mutation abundance cases from
   no mutation cases. In this study, all of 359 NSCLC samples were tested
   by ARMS. Seventeen samples with larger Ct or Delta Ct than cutoff values
   were retested by PCR-sequencing. TKI treatment responses were monitored
   on the cases with ARMS negative and PCR-sequencing positive results. One
   exon 18 G719X case, 67 exon 19 deletion cases, 2 exon 20 insertion
   cases, 1 exon 20 T790M case, 60 exon 21 L858R cases, 5 exon 21 L861Q
   cases and 201 wild type cases were identified by ARMS. Another 22 cases
   were evaluated as wild type but had later amplification fluorescent
   curves. Seventeen out of these 22 cases were retested by PCR-sequencing.
   It turns out that 3 out of 3 cases with exon 19 deletion later
   amplifications, 2 out of 2 cases with L858R later amplifications and 4
   out of 12 cases with T790M later amplifications were identified as
   mutation positive. Two cases with exon 19 deletion and L858R

Abstract = {{Barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT), which has a high dielectric constant was
   used as the filler in silicone rubber (SR) based-DE composites. The BT
   was added in order to achieve higher voltage-induced strains and
   decrease the magnitude of the applied electric fields. The morphology of
   SR/BT composites was observed using a scanning electron microscope. The
   mechanical property of the SR/BT composites, which was characterized by
   an equi-biaxial static test, was obtained using a bubble inflation test
   system. Significantly, an optimum equi-biaxial pre-stretch ratio was
   determined using this method in order to enhance the actuated strain
   achieved under an applied electric field. Concurrently, the measurements
   of dielectric constant and loss tangent were carried out using
   dielectric spectroscopy. Using the pre-stretch ratio obtained from
   equi-biaxial testing, the influence of BT content on the
   electromechanical properties of SR-based DEs was investigated. The
   results showed that the BT exhibited excellent dispersibility in SR
   matrices, but agglomerates appeared in the composites with higher filler
   content. An increase of dielectric constant was obtained by increasing
   the BT content in SR with low dielectric loss tangents below 0.035 at
   0.1 Hz for all films. Also, the composite of SR/BT exhibited
   hyperelasticity with the minimum secant modulus at the optimised stretch
   ratio of 1.6. Under this specified pre-stretch ratio, a maximum actuated
   area strain of approximately 57 \% was achieved for the film having a
   filler loading of 20 wt\% BT. This strain corresponded to a relatively
   low dielectric strength of around 46 V/A mu m. For all the DE composites
   tested, a maximum electromechanical energy density (e) of 0.042 MJ/m(3)
   and an electromechanical coupling efficiency (K (2)) of 0.59 were
   obtained for DEs with 30 and 20 wt\% BT, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Proxy re-encryption (PRE) is a cryptographic primitive that allows a
   proxy to turn an Alice's ciphertext into a Bob's ciphertext on the same
   plaintext. At present, there are many different PRE schemes that have
   been proposed with different properties. However, all of them are based
   on the logarithm assumption and the large integer factorization
   assumption except for a bidirectional PRE scheme over lattices. In this
   paper, we construct the first multi-use unidirectional PRE scheme based
   on lattices. In addition, the generation of the PRE key does not
   interact with two users, and the scheme can resist collusion attacks.
   Moreover, it is proved chosen plaintext attack secure in the standard
   model based on the Learning With Errors assumption. Finally, an
   identity-based PRE is obtained from the basic construction. Copyright

Abstract = {{Effects of water-misting sprays with forced ventilation after transport
   during summer on meat quality, stress parameters, glycolytic potential
   and microstructures of muscle in broilers were investigated. A total of
   105 mixed-sex Arbor Acres broilers were divided into three treatment
   groups: i) 45-min transport without rest (T group), ii) 45-min transport
   with 1-h rest (TR group), iii) 45-min transport with 15-min
   water-misting sprays with forced ventilation and 45-min rest (TWFR
   group). The results showed the TWFR group significantly increased
   (p<0.05) initial muscle pH (pH(i)) and ultimate pH (pH(u)) and
   significantly reduced L{*}(p<0.05), drip loss, cook loss, creatine
   kinase, lactate dehydrogenase activity, plasma glucose content, lactate
   and glycolytic potential when compared with other groups. Microstructure
   of the muscle from TWFR group broilers under light microscopy showed
   smaller intercellular spaces among muscle fibers and bundles compared
   with T group. In conclusion this study indicated water-misting sprays
   with forced ventilation after transport could relieve the stress caused
   by transport under high temperature, which was favorable for the
   broilers' welfare. Furthermore, water-misting sprays with forced
   ventilation after transport slowed down the postmortem glycolysis rate
   and inhibited the occurrence of PSE-like meat in broilers. Although rest
   after transport could also improve the meat quality, the effect was not
   as significant as water-misting sprays with forced ventilation after
   transport.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: This study was designed to examine the neuroprotective effects of
   bakkenolide-IIIa, a major novel compound extracted from the rhizome of
   P. trichinous. Methods: Transient focal cerebral damage model in rats
   and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in cultured hippocampal neurons
   were performed. The amount of apoptotic neurons was determined using
   TUNEL assay. The expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, Akt, ERK1/2, IKK beta, I
   kappa B alpha were measured using Western blot. The nuclear
   translocation and activation of NF-kappa B was measured using a
   fluorescence microscope and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
   Results: Bakkenolide-IIIa (4, 8, 16 mg/kg; i.g.) was administered
   immediately after reperfusion could reduce the brain infarct volume, and
   the neurological deficit, as well as a high dose of bakkenolide-IIIa,
   increases the 72 h survival rate in cerebrally damaged rats. In vitro
   data demonstrated that bakkenolide-IIIa could increase cell viability
   and decrease the amount of apoptotic cells in cultured primary
   hippocampal neurons exposed to OGD. Bakkenolide-IIIa also
   dose-dependently increased the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax. These results
   indicated that inhibition of apoptosis partly mediated the
   neuroprotection of bakkenolide-IIIa. Furthermore, bakkenolide-IIIa
   inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, IKK beta, I kappa B alpha,
   and p65 in cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to OGD. Bakkenolide-IIIa
   not only inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B in cultured
   neurons exposed to OGD, but also inhibited the activation of NF-kappa B
   in peri-infarct area in cerebrally damaged rats. Conclusion:
   Collectively, our findings indicated that bakkenolide-IIIa protects
   against cerebral damage by inhibiting AKT and ERK1/2 activation and
   inactivated NF-kappa B signaling.}},

Title = {{Learning Predictive Interactions Using Information Gain and Bayesian
   Network Scoring}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The problems of correlation and classification are long-standing in the
   fields of statistics and machine learning, and techniques have been
   developed to address these problems. We are now in the era of
   high-dimensional data, which is data that can concern billions of
   variables. These data present new challenges. In particular, it is
   difficult to discover predictive variables, when each variable has
   little marginal effect. An example concerns Genome-wide Association
   Studies (GWAS) datasets, which involve millions of single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNPs), where some of the SNPs interact epistatically to
   affect disease status. Towards determining these interacting SNPs,
   researchers developed techniques that addressed this specific problem.
   However, the problem is more general, and so these techniques are
   applicable to other problems concerning interactions. A difficulty with
   many of these techniques is that they do not distinguish whether a
   learned interaction is actually an interaction or whether it involves
   several variables with strong marginal effects.
   Methodology/Findings
   We address this problem using information gain and Bayesian network
   scoring. First, we identify candidate interactions by determining
   whether together variables provide more information than they do
   separately. Then we use Bayesian network scoring to see if a candidate
   interaction really is a likely model. Our strategy is called MBS-IGain.
   Using 100 simulated datasets and a real GWAS Alzheimer's dataset, we
   investigated the performance of MBS-IGain.
   Conclusions/Significance
   When analyzing the simulated datasets, MBS-IGain substantially
   out-performed nine previous methods at locating interacting predictors,
   and at identifying interactions exactly. When analyzing the real
   Alzheimer's dataset, we obtained new results and results that
   substantiated previous findings. We conclude that MBS-IGain is highly
   effective at finding interactions in high-dimensional datasets. This
   result is significant because we have increasingly abundant
   high-dimensional data in many domains, and to learn causes and perform
   prediction/classification using these data, we often must first identify
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Municipal wastewater contains a mixture of brown (feces and toilet
   paper), yellow (urine), and gray (kitchen, bathroom and wash) waters.
   Urine contributes approximately 70-80\% of the nitrogen (N), 50-70\% of
   the phosphorus (P) load and 60-70\% of the pharmaceutical residues in
   normal domestic sewage. This study evaluated the impact of different
   levels of source separation of urine on an existing biological nutrient
   removal (BNR) process. A process model of an existing biological
   nutrient removal (BNR) plant was used. Increasing the amount of urine
   diverted from the water reclamation facilities, has little impact on
   effluent ammonia (NH3-N) concentration, but effluent nitrate (NO3-N)
   concentration decreases. If nitrification is necessary then no reduction
   in the sludge age can be realized. However, a point is reached where the
   remaining influent nitrogen load matches the nitrogen requirements for
   biomass growth, and no residual nitrogen needs to be nitrified. That
   allows a significant reduction in sludge age, implying reduced process
   volume requirements. In situations where nitrification is required,
   lower effluent nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations were realized due to both
   the lower influent nitrogen content in the wastewater and a more
   favorable nitrogen-to-carbon ratio for denitrification. The external
   carbon requirement for denitrification decreases as the urine separation
   efficiency increases due to the lower influent nitrogen content in the
   wastewater and a more favorable nitrogen-to-carbon ratio for
   denitrification. The effluent phosphorus concentration decreases when
   the amount of urine sent to water reclamation facilities is decreased
   due to lower influent phosphorus concentrations. In the case of chemical
   phosphate removal, urine separation reduces the amount of chemicals
   required.}},

Abstract = {{The genomics revolution has generated an unprecedented number of assets
   to propel innovation. Initial availability of genomics-based
   applications show a significant potential to contribute addressing
   global challenges, such as human health, food security, alternative
   sources of energies, and environmental sustainability. In the last
   years, most developed and emerging nations have established bioeconomy
   agendas where genomics plays a major role to meet their local needs.
   Genomic medicine is one of the most visible areas where genomics
   innovation is likely to contribute to a more individualized, predictive,
   and preventive medical practice. Examples in agriculture, dairy and
   beef, fishery, aquaculture, and forests industries include the effective
   selection of genetic variants associated to traits of economic value.
   Some, in addition to producing more and better foods, already represent
   an important increase in revenues to their respective industries. It is
   reasonable to predict that genomics applications will lead to a paradigm
   shift in our ability to ease significant health, economic, and social
   burdens. However, to successfully benefit from genomics innovations, it
   is imperative to address a number of hurdles related to generating
   robust scientific evidence, developing lower-cost sequencing
   technologies, effective bioin-formatics, as well as sensitive ethical,
   economical, environmental, legal, and social aspects associated with the

Abstract = {{The thermal decomposition mechanism and process of MgCl2 center dot
   6H(2)O center dot 1,4-C4H8O2 were studied using thermogravimetric-mass
   spectrometry analysis for non-isothermal decomposition, and mechanical
   convection drying for isothermal decomposition. The pyrolysis products
   were analysed using chemical analysis, GC measurement, and X-ray powder
   diffraction. The results showed that there were four stages in the
   non-isothermal decomposition of MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O center dot
   1,4-C4H8O2 from 25 degrees C to 250 degrees C. The first stage should be
   the decomposition of 1,4-C4H8O2 in the MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O center
   dot 1,4-C4H8O2 adduct, the second and third stages turned out to be the
   elimination of crystal water, while the fourth stage included the
   elimination of water and HCl. The kinetic analysis of the thermal
   decomposition process was performed using the Coats-Redfern method and
   the Malek method. Results showed that the first two stages obeyed the
   2-dimensional phase boundary mechanism (model R2) and the 3-dimensional
   phase boundary mechanism (model R3), respectively, while the last two
   ones followed the nucleation and nuclei growth (A1) kinetics. The
   isothermal decomposition process for 48h from 60 degrees C up to 140
   degrees C could be divided into three groups: Below 60 degrees C, there
   was no decomposition of MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O center dot 1,4-C4H8O2;
   for the temperature range from 70 degrees C up to 100 degrees C, the
   main decomposition product was MgCl2 center dot 4H(2)O; while for the
   temperature range of 110 degrees C to 140 degrees C, the main products
   were a mixture of MgCl2 center dot 4H(2)O and MgCl2 center dot 2H(2)O.
   The temperature of 100 degrees C was chosen for further industrial MgCl2
   center dot 6H(2)O center dot 4-C4H8O2 decomposition study due to low
   energy consumption and tiny amount of by-products. This study provides a
   valuable theoretical basis for industrializing the MgCl2 center dot
   6H(2)O center dot 1,4-C4H8O2 decomposition process. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{How health care providers are paid affects how medicine is practiced. It
   is thus important to assess provider payment models not only from the
   economic perspective but also from the ethical perspective. China
   recently started to reform the provider payment model in the health care
   system from fee-for-service to case-based payment. This paper aims to
   examine this transition from an ethical perspective. We collected
   empirical studies on the impact of case-based payment in the Chinese
   health care system and applied a systematic ethical matrix that
   integrates clinical ethics and public health ethics to analyze the
   empirical findings. We identified eleven prominent ethical issues
   related to case-based payment. Some ethical problems of case-based
   payment in China are comparable to ethical problems of managed care and
   diagnosis related groups in high-income countries. However, in this
   paper we discuss in greater detail four specific ethical issues in the
   Chinese context: professionalism, the patient-physician relationship,
   access to care and patient autonomy. Based on the analysis, we
   cautiously infer that case-based payment is currently more ethically
   acceptable than fee-for-service in the context of China, mainly because
   it seems to lower financial barriers to access care. Nonetheless, it
   will be difficult to justify the implementation of case-based payment if
   no additional measures are taken to monitor and minimize its existing
   negative ethical implications.}},

Abstract = {{The monodisperse porous cube, cake and spheroid-like alpha-Fe2O3
   microparticles were successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal
   approach. The as-synthesized alpha-Fe2O3 microparticles were
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (
   SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and gas-sensing
   measurement device, and the results showed that the diameters of all
   these microparticles were around 2-3 mu m. Mean-while, the gas-sensing
   properties revealed that both reaction time of hydrothermal and Cu
   doping could remarkably enhance the performances of gas sensors. The
   response value of 1.0 wt\% Cu-doped alpha-Fe2O3 microcakes to 500 ppm
   acetone was 205.3 at 270 degrees C when the reaction time was 15 h,
   which was about 11.9 times higher than that of ammonia (about 17.3). In
   addition, both of the response and recovery time were within 10 s,
   demonstrating the sensor based on 1.0 wt\% Cu-doped alpha-Fe2O3
   microcakes has a potential application for acetone detection at the
   reaction time of 15 h. Finally, the possible formation mechanism and
   gas-sensing mechanism of alpha-Fe2O3 microstructures were proposed, too.

Abstract = {{Functionalized magnetic nanoparticles have shown great application
   potentials in water treatment processes especially for bacterial
   removal. Antibacterial agent, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), was
   employed to modify Fe3O4 nanoparticles to fabricate bactericidal
   paramagnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@CTAB). The as-prepared Fe3O4@CTAB
   could effectively capture both Gram-negative Escherichia colt and
   Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis from water. For both cell types, more
   than 99\% of bacteria with initial concentration of 1.5 x 10(7) CFU/mL
   could be inactivated by Fe3O4@CTAB (0.5 g/L) within 60 min. Fe3O4@CTAB
   could remove more than 99\% of cells over a wide pH (from 3 to 10) and
   solution ionic strength range (from 0 to 1000 mM). The copresence of
   sulfate and nitrate did not affect the bacterial capture efficiencies,
   whereas, phosphate and silicate slightly decreased the bacterial removal
   rates. However, more than 91\% and 81\% of cells could be captured at 10
   mM of phosphate and silicate, respectively. Over 80\% of cells could be
   removed even in the presence of 10 mg/L of humic acid. Moreover,
   Fe3O4@CTAB exhibited good reusability, and greater than 83\% of cells

Abstract = {{Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH), which is characterized by
   pulmonary arteriolar remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy, is
   still a life-threatening disease with the current treatment strategies.
   The underlying molecular mechanisms of HPH remain unclear. Our
   previously published study showed that Wnt5a, one of the ligands in the
   Wnt family, was critically involved in the inhibition of hypoxia-induced
   pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation by downregulation of
   beta-catenin/cyclin D1 invitro. In this study, we investigated the
   possible functions and mechanisms of Wnt5a in HPH invivo. Recombinant
   mouse Wnt5a (rmWnt5a) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was
   administered to male C57/BL6 mice weekly from the first day to the end
   of the two or four weeks after exposed to hypoxia (10\% O-2).
   Hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension was associated with a marked
   increase in beta-catenin/cyclin D1 expression in lungs. Right
   ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy index
   were reduced in animals treated with rmWnt5a compared with PBS.
   Histology showed less pulmonary vascular remodeling and right
   ventricular hypertrophy in the group treated with rmWnt5a than with PBS.
   Treatment with rmWnt5a resulted in a concomitant reduction in
   beta-catenin/cyclin D1 levels in lungs. These data demonstrate that
   Wnt5a exerts its beneficial effects on HPH by regulating pulmonary
   vascular remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy in a manner that
   is associated with reduction in beta-catenin/cyclin D1 signaling. A
   therapy targeting the beta-catenin/cyclin D1 signaling pathway might be
   a potential strategy for HPH treatment.}},

Abstract = {{An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of
   replacing fish meal (FM) with blends of alternative proteins in diets

   5.6g. Five diets were formulated with 400-440gkg(-1) crude protein
   (380gkg(-1) digestible). These included a high 520gkg(-1) FM control
   diet, a series of three diets with a sequential replacement of FM
   containing 410gkg(-1), 510gkg(-1) and 630gkg(-1) of a soy-based protein
   blend (SPC) and 200gkg(-1), 100gkg(-1) and 0gkg(-1) FM, respectively and
   a fifth diet containing 550gkg(-1) of a corn-based protein blend (CGM)
   and 100gkg(-1) FM. Survival was highest in the FM control group at 99\%
   but all other performance measures (weight gain, feed conversion ratio,
   specific growth rate and protein retention efficiency) were worse than
   the other treatment groups. Weight gain reached a maximum of 595\% in
   the SPC 200gkg(-1) FM treatment group. Performance decreased as
   inclusion of the soy-based protein blend increased. The CGM treatment
   performed comparably to the SPC 100g kg(-1) FM treatment among all
   measures, except for survival, which was higher in the CGM 100gkg(-1) FM
   treatment. With nutrient levels and alternative protein blends used in

Title = {{Health literacy: how nurses can make a difference}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{21-28}},
Month = {{DEC-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To be a call to action to nurses and all health professionals to
   implement proven effective evidence based strategies that can decrease
   health literacy demands on health consumers, and improve health outcomes
   and the provision of safe person-centred health care.
   Primary argument
   Health professionals, specifically nurses, are important providers of
   health information to health consumers. They influence the health
   literacy demands placed on health consumers through the way they
   organise, present and communicate information (Australian Commission on
   Safety and Quality in Health Care, 2014). All health professionals need
   to be cognisant of the range of effective strategies they can implement
   to reduce the health literacy demands on health consumers through
   effective interpersonal communication, health materials in the written
   and visual formats and the creation of health literate environments to
   improve health outcomes and the provision of safe care.
   Population measurements of functional health literacy levels (Australian
   Bureau of Statistics 2008) indicate that 59 per cent of the Australian
   population aged 15 to 74 years did not achieve an adequate health
   literacy skill level to meet the complex demands of everyday life and
   work in a knowledge-based economy.
   Conclusion
   An understanding by all health professionals of the concept of health
   literacy, and the evidence based strategies they can implement to
   decrease health literacy demands on health consumers is imperative to
   enhancing the involvement of health consumers in their care, improving
   health outcomes and in the provision of safe health care.}},

Title = {{Ablation of Porcine Ligamentum Flavum With Ho:YAG, Q-Switched Ho:YAG,
   and Quadrupled Nd:YAG Lasers}},
Journal = {{LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Ligamentum flavum (LF) is a tough, rubbery
   connective tissue providing a portion of the ligamentous stability to
   the spinal column, and in its hypertrophied state forms a significant
   compressive pathology in degenerative spinal stenosis. The interaction
   of lasers and this biological tissue have not been thoroughly studied.
   Technological advances improving endoscopic surgical access to the
   spinal canal makes selective removal of LF using small, flexible tools
   such as laser-coupled fiber optics increasingly attractive for treatment
   of debilitating spinal stenosis. Testing was performed to assess the
   effect of Ho:YAG, Q-switched Ho: YAG, and frequency quadrupled Nd:YAG
   lasers on samples of porcine LF. The objective was to evaluate the
   suitability of these lasers for surgical removal of LF.
   Study Design/Materials and Methods: LF was resected from porcine spine
   within 2 hours of sacrifice and stored in saline until immediately prior
   to laser irradiation, which occurred within an additional 2 hours. The
   optical absorbance of a sample was measured over the spectral band from
   190 to 2,360nm both before and after dehydration. For the experiments
   using the Ho:YAG (lambda = 2,080 nm, t(p) = 140 mu s, FWHM) and
   Q-Switched Ho:YAG (lambda = 2,080 nm, t(p) = 260 ns, FWHM) lasers,
   energy was delivered to the LF through a laser-fiber optic with 600 mu m
   core and NA = 0.39. For the experiment using the frequency quadrupled
   Nd:YAG laser (lambda = 266 nm, t(p) = 5 ns FWHM), rather than applying
   the laser energy through a laser-fiber, the energy was focused through
   an aperture and lens directly onto the LF. Five experiments were
   conducted to evaluate the effect of the given lasers on LF. First, using
   the Ho:YAG laser, the single-pulse laser-hole depth versus laser fluence
   was measured with the laser-fiber in direct contact with the LF (1 g
   force) and with a standoff distance of 1 mm between the laser-fiber face
   and the LF. Second, with the LF remaining in situ and the spine bisected
   along the coronal plane, the surface temperature of the LF was measured
   with an IR camera during irradiation with the Ho:YAG laser, with and
   without constant saline flush. Third, the mass loss was measured over
   the course of 450 Ho:YAG pulses. Fourth, hole depth and temperature were
   measured over 30 pulses of fixed fluence from the Ho:YAG and Q-Switched
   Ho:YAG lasers. Fifth, the ablation rate and surface temperature were
   measured as a function of fluence from the Nd:YAG laser. Several LF
   staining and hole-depth measurement techniques were also explored.
   Results: Aside from the expected absorbance peaks corresponding to the
   water in the LF, the most significant peaks in absorbance were located
   in the spectral band from 190 to 290 nm and persisted after the tissue
   was dehydrated. In the first experiment, using the Ho:YAG laser and with
   the laser-fiber in direct contact with the LF, the lowest single-pulse
   fluence for which LF was visibly removed was 35 J/cm(2). Testing was
   conducted at 6 fluences between 35 and 354 J/cm(2). Over this range the
   single-pulse hole depth was shown to be near linear (R-2 = 0.9374, M =
   1.6), ranging from 40 to 639 mu m (N = 3). For the case where the
   laser-fiber face was displaced 1 mm from the LF surface, the lowest
   single-pulse fluence for which tissue was visibly removed was 72
   J/cm(2). Testing was conducted at 4 energy densities between 72 and 180
   J/cm(2). Over this range the single-pulse hole depth was shown to be
   near linear (R-2 = 0.8951, M = 1.4), ranging from 31 to 220 mu m (N =
   3). In the second experiment, with LF in situ, constant flushing with
   room temperature saline was shown to drastically reduce surface
   temperature during exposure to Ho:YAG at 5 Hz with the laser-fiber in
   direct contact with the LF. Without saline, over 1 minute of treatment
   with a per-pulse fluence of 141 mJ/cm(2), the average maximum surface
   temperature measured 110 degrees C. With 10 cc's of saline flushed over
   1 minute and a per-pulse laser fluence of 212 mJ/cm(2), the average
   maximum surface temperature was 35 degrees C. In the third experiment,
   mass loss was shown to be linear over 450 pulses of 600 mJ from the
   Ho:YAG laser (212 J/cm(2), direct contact, N = 4; 108 J/cm(2), 1 mm
   standoff, N = 4). With the laser-fiber in direct contact, an average of
   53mg was removed (R-2 = 0.996, M = 0.117) and with 1 mm laser-fiber
   standoff, an average of 44 mg was removed (R-2 = 0.9988, M = 0.097). In
   the fourth experiment, 30 pulses of the Ho:YAG and Q-Switched Ho:YAG
   lasers at 1 mm standoff, and 5 Hz produced similar hole depths for the
   tested fluences of 9 J/cm(2) (151 and 154 mu m, respectively) and 18
   J/cm(2) (470 and 442 mu m, respectively), though the Ho:YAG laser
   produced significantly more carbonization around the rim of the
   laser-hole. The increased carbonization was corroborated by higher
   measured LF temperature. In all tests with the Ho:YAG and Q-Switched Ho:
   YAG, an audible photo-acoustic affect coincided with the laser pulse. In
   the fifth experiment, with the frequency quadrupled Nd:YAG laser at 15
   Hz for 450 pulses, ablation depth per pulse was shown to be linear for
   the fluence range of 0.18 - 0.73 J/cm(2) (R-2 = 0.989, M = 2.4). There
   was no noticeable photo-acoustic effect nor charring around the rim of
   the laser-hole.
   Conclusion: The Ho:YAG, Q-Switched Ho:YAG, and frequency quadrupled
   Nd:YAG lasers were shown to remove ligamentum flavum (LF). A single
   pulse of the Ho: YAG laser was shown to cause tearing of the tissue and
   a large zone of necrosis surrounding the laser-hole. Multiple pulses of
   the Ho:YAG and Q-Switched Ho:YAG lasers caused charring around the rim
   of the laser-hole, thoughthe extent of charring was more extensive with
   the Ho:YAG laser. Charring caused by the Ho:YAG laser was shown to be
   mitigated by continuously flushing the affected LF with saline during
   irradiation. The Nd:YAG laser was shown to ablate LF with nogross
   visible indication of thermal damage to surrounding LF. Lasers Surg.

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of this study was to quantify the reduction of perceived
   pain levels during lymphoscintigraphy for melanoma by altering the pH of
   the Tc-99m-sulfur colloid to near the physiologic value of 7.40.
   Patients and Methods This is an institutional review board- and Food and
   Drug Administration-approved randomized, double-blinded, prospective
   crossover trial, registered with clinicaltrials.org. Before beginning
   the procedure and after signing informed consent, 60 serial enrollees
   presenting for sentinel lymph node imaging of melanoma of the thorax and
   appendicular structures completed a questionnaire addressing background
   information, administered by a research support nurse. An investigator
   (N.H.) prepared the injections to be used and labeled them such that no
   one else could discover which injections contained standard-of-care
   solution and which contained the pH-altered solution (buffered to near
   pH 7.40 using sodium bicarbonate). After each injection, the enrollee
   was asked by a research support nurse to quantify the pain of each
   injection using a scale of 0 to 10. The injection site location (head,
   thorax, appendicular structures, and other) was also recorded.
   Results Sixty subjects were enrolled in the study, of which 57 had
   complete data. On average, there was a significant mean (SD) decrease of
   1.42 (2.17) points (95\% confidence interval, 0.85-2.00) on a pain scale
   of 0 to 10 when the buffered injections were used as compared with the
   standard-of-care injections (P < 0.0001). Ordering of injections did not
   significantly affect perceived pain scores.
   Conclusions The use of sodium bicarbonate to buffer the pH of
   Tc-99m-sulfur colloid to near the physiologic value of 7.40
   significantly reduced perceived pain levels during nonbreast
   lymphoscintigraphy.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims: Leptin, an adipokine elevated in obesity, may be
   related to an adverse cardiovascular risk profile in childhood. However,
   evidence for this relationship in pre-pubertal children is scarce. We
   aimed to analyze the relationship between leptin levels and lipid and
   insulin profiles in Spanish children.
   Methods and results: Our population-based sample included 389 males and
   369 females aged 6 8 years.
   Lipid levels were determined by standard methods, insulin by
   radioimmunoassay and leptin by sandwich ELISA. Leptin levels were higher
   in girls (8.6 ng/ml) than boys (4.7 ng/ml) (p < 0.001). Leptin increased
   from ages 6 to 8 in girls, but remained steady in boys. In both sexes,
   leptin increased significantly (p < 0.001) across weight category from
   normal weight to obese. Children in the highest tertile of leptin
   concentration showed significantly (p < 0.01) lower levels of
   HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein-Al (apo-Al) and significantly
   higher triglyceride (TG) levels than children in lower tertiles.
   However, in linear regression analysis, after adjustment for body mass
   index (BMI), leptin only accounted for 1.5\% of the variance of HDL-C in
   boys, and 2.6\% of the variance of apo-Al in girls. Leptin was strongly
   and positively correlated with insulin and HOMA. Upon regression
   analysis, leptin contributed to over 20\% of the variability in insulin
   and HOMA, independent of BMI.
   Conclusion: Leptin levels show sex differences in pre-pubertal children.
   In this age group, leptin levels are strongly related to insulin, and
   affect lipid profile namely HDL-C, apo-Al and TG particularly when
   leptin levels are high. (C) 2015 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the

Abstract = {{Background: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programmes have been
   shown to decrease complications and hospital stay. The
   cost-effectiveness of such programmes has been demonstrated for
   colorectal surgery. This study aimed to assess the economic outcomes of
   a standard ERAS programme for pancreaticoduodenectomy.
   Methods: ERAS for pancreaticoduodenectomy was implemented in October
   2012. All consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy
   until October 2014 were recorded. This group was compared in terms of
   costs with a cohort of consecutive patients who underwent
   pancreaticoduodenectomy between January 2010 and October 2012, before
   ERAS implementation. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative real
   costs were collected for each patient via the hospital administration. A
   bootstrap independent t test was used for comparison. ERAS-specific
   costs were integrated into the model.
   Results: The groups were well matched in terms of demographic and
   surgical details. The overall complication rate was 68 per cent (50 of
   74 patients) and 82 per cent (71 of 87 patients) in the ERAS and
   pre-ERAS groups respectively (P=0.046). Median hospital stay was lower
   in the ERAS group (15 versus 19 days; P=0.029). ERAS-specific costs were
   (sic) 922 per patient. Mean total costs were (sic) 56 083 per patient in
   the ERAS group and (sic) 63 821 per patient in the pre-ERAS group
   (P=0.273). The mean intensive care unit (ICU) and intermediate care
   costs were (sic) 9139 and (sic) 13 793 per patient for the ERAS and
   pre-ERAS groups respectively (P=0.151).
   Conclusion: ERAS implementation for pancreaticoduodenectomy did not
   increase the costs in this cohort. Savings were noted in
   anaesthesia/operating room, medication and laboratory costs. Fewer
   patients in the ERAS group required an ICU stay.}},

Abstract = {{SCYX-7158, an oxaborole, is currently in Phase I clinical trials for the
   treatment of human African trypanosomiasis. Here we investigate possible
   modes of action against Trypanosoma brucei using orthogonal
   chemo-proteomic and genomic approaches. SILAC-based proteomic studies
   using an oxaborole analogue immobilised onto a resin was used either in
   competition with a soluble oxaborole or an immobilised inactive control
   to identify thirteen proteins common to both strategies. Cell-cycle
   analysis of cells incubated with sub-lethal concentrations of an
   oxaborole identified a subtle but significant accumulation of G2 and >G2
   cells. Given the possibility of compromised DNA fidelity, we
   investigated long-term exposure of T. brucei to oxaboroles by generating
   resistant cell lines in vitro. Resistance proved more difficult to
   generate than for drugs currently used in the field, and in one of our
   three cell lines was unstable. Whole-genome sequencing of the resistant
   cell lines revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms in 66 genes and
   several large-scale genomic aberrations. The absence of a simple
   consistent mechanism among resistant cell lines and the diverse list of
   binding partners from the proteomic studies suggest a degree of
   polypharmacology that should reduce the risk of resistance to this
   compound class emerging in the field. The combined genetic and chemical
   biology approaches have provided lists of candidates to be investigated
   for more detailed information on the mode of action of this promising
   new drug class.}},

Abstract = {{How do people negotiate commitments to engaging in joint activity while
   at the same time anticipating and managing the inherent risks of
   collaboration? We explore this question through the ethnographic example
   of a hackathon, a collaborative software-design competition. We focus
   specifically on the earliest and, in many ways, most uncertain phase of
   collaboration, in which commitment and activity simultaneously emerge:
   team formation. We analyze mercurial allegiances in terms of a
   technoliberal participation ideology closely associated with the mores
   of the digital economy, which paradoxically emphasizes intensive
   project-based collaboration but limited interpersonal responsibility. We
   examine the verbal and nonverbal resources (such as stance-taking,
   politeness, reported speech, humor, and gesture) that prospective
   teammates use to modulate expressions of commitment, and the ways in
   which they pursue self-interested projects while maintaining social
   relatedness in order to accomplish joint activity in a context of social
   volatility.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that elosulfase alfa has a
   favorable efficacy/safety profile in Morquio A patients aged >= 5 y.
   This study evaluated safety and impact on urine keratan sulfate (uKS)
   levels and growth velocity in younger patients.
   METHODS: Fifteen Morquio A patients aged <5 y received elosulfase alfa
   2.0 mg/kg/week for 52 wk during the primary treatment phase of a phase
   II, open-label, multinational study. Primary endpoint was safety and
   tolerability; secondary endpoints were change in uKS and growth velocity
   Over 52 wk.
   RESULTS: All 15 patients completed the primary treatment phase. Six of
   743 infusions (0.8\%) administered led to adverse events (AEs) requiring
   infusion interruption and medical intervention. Eleven patients (73.3\%)
   had >= 1 study drug-related AE, mostly infusion-associated reactions.
   Mean z-score growth rate per year numerically improved from -0.6 at
   baseline to -0.4 at week 52. Comparison to untreated subjects of similar
   age in the Morquio A Clinical Assessment Program study showed a smaller
   decrease in height z-scores for treated than for untreated patients.
   Mean percent change from baseline in uKS was -30.2\% at 2 wk and -43.5\%
   at 52 wk.
   CONCLUSION: Early intervention with elosulfase alfa is well-tolerated
   and produces a decrease in uKS and a trend toward improvement in growth.}},

Abstract = {{Coronary artery disease (CAD) often leads to myocardial infarction,
   which may be fatal. Risk factors can be used to predict CAD, which may
   subsequently lead to prevention or early intervention. Patient data such
   as co-morbidities, medication history, social history and family history
   are required to determine the risk factors for a disease. However, risk
   factor data are usually embedded in unstructured clinical narratives if
   the data is not collected specifically for risk assessment purposes.
   Clinical text mining can be used to extract data related to risk factors
   from unstructured clinical notes. This study presents methods to extract
   Framingham risk factors from unstructured electronic health records
   using clinical text mining and to calculate 10-year coronary artery
   disease risk scores in a cohort of diabetic patients. We developed a
   rule-based system to extract risk factors: age, gender, total
   cholesterol, HDL-C, blood pressure, diabetes history and smoking
   history. The results showed that the output from the text mining system
   was reliable, but there was a significant amount of missing data to
   calculate the Framingham risk score. A systematic approach for
   understanding missing data was followed by implementation of imputation
   strategies. An analysis of the 10-year Framingham risk scores for
   coronary artery disease in this cohort has shown that the majority of
   the diabetic patients are at moderate risk of CAD. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{An analysis of the Research Team-Service User relationship from the
   Service User perspective: a consideration of `The Three Rs' (Roles,

Abstract = {{Background This article debates interview data from service users who
   engaged with the work of a Collaboration for Leadership in Applied
   Health Research and Care (CLAHRC). The evidence base, to date,
   concerning the nature of CLAHRC work at the frontline (i.e. What is it
   actually like to do CLAHRC work?) is meagre; thus, this article
   represents an original contribution to that literature. Further, this
   article analyses service users' participation in research - as members
   of the research team - and so contributes to the body of developing
   literature regarding involvement too.
   Objective This article explores the nature of the Research Team-Service
   User relationship, plus associated roles, relations and responsibilities
   of collaborative health research.
   Design Qualitative social science research was undertaken in a
   health-care research organization utilizing interview method and a
   medical sociology and organizational sociology theoretical framework for
   analysis. Data utilized originate from a larger evaluation study that
   focuses on the CLAHRC as an iterative organization and explores members'
   experiences.
   Results There can be a disparity between initial expectations and actual
   experiences of involvement for service users. Therefore, as structured
   via `The Three Rs' (Roles, Relations and Responsibilities), aspects of
   the relationship are evaluated (e.g. motivation, altruism, satisfaction,
   transparency, scope, feedback, communication, time).
   Regarding the inclusion of service users in health research teams, a
   careful consideration of `The Three Rs' is required to ensure
   expectations match experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed operations
   in the world, yet little is known about the genetic mechanisms that
   predispose individuals to develop inguinal hernias. We perform a
   genome-wide association analysis of surgically confirmed inguinal
   hernias in 72,805 subjects (5,295 cases and 67,510 controls) and confirm
   top associations in an independent cohort of 92,444 subjects with
   self-reported hernia repair surgeries (9,701 cases and 82,743 controls).
   We identify four novel inguinal hernia susceptibility loci in the
   regions of EFEMP1, WT1, EBF2 and ADAMTS6. Moreover, we observe
   expression of all four genes in mouse connective tissue and network
   analyses show an important role for two of these genes (EFEMP1 and WT1)
   in connective tissue maintenance/homoeostasis. Our findings provide
   insight into the aetiology of hernia development and highlight genetic
   pathways for studies of hernia development and its treatment.}},

Journal = {{AGING CELL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{The mutated form of the Ca2+ channel CALHM1 (Ca2+ homeostasis modulator
   1), P86L-CALHM1, has been correlated with early onset of Alzheimer's
   disease (A beta). P86L-CALHM1 increases production of amyloid beta (A
   beta) upon extracellular Ca2+ removal and its subsequent addback. The
   aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the overexpression of
   CALHM1 and P86L-CALHM, upon A beta treatment, on the following: (i) the
   intracellular Ca2+ signal pathway; (ii) cell survival proteins ERK1/2
   and Ca2+/cAMP response element binding (CREB); and (iii) cell
   vulnerability after treatment with A beta. Using aequorins to measure
   the effect of nuclear Ca2+ concentrations ({[}Ca2+](n)) and cytosolic
   Ca2+ concentrations ({[}Ca2+](c)) on Ca2+ entry conditions, we observed
   that baseline {[}Ca2+] n was higher in CALHM1 and P86L-CALHM1 cells than
   in control cells. Moreover, exposure to A beta affected {[}Ca2+](c)
   levels in HeLa cells overexpressing CALHM1 and P86L-CALHM1 compared with
   control cells. Treatment with A beta elicited a significant decrease in
   the cell survival proteins p-ERK and p-CREB, an increase in the activity
   of caspases 3 and 7, and more frequent cell death by inducing early
   apoptosis in P86L-CALHM1-overexpressing cells than in CALHM1 or control
   cells. These results suggest that in the presence of A beta, P86L-CALHM1
   shifts the balance between neurodegeneration and neuronal survival
   toward the stimulation of pro-cytotoxic pathways, thus potentially
   contributing to its deleterious effects in AD.}},

Abstract = {{Oncocytomas are predominantly benign neoplasms possessing pathogenic
   mitochondrial mutations and accumulation of respiration-defective
   mitochondria, characteristics of unknown significance. Using exome and
   transcriptome sequencing, we identified two main subtypes of renal
   oncocytoma. Type 1 is diploid with CCND1 rearrangements, whereas type 2
   is aneuploid with recurrent loss of chromosome 1, X or Y, and/or 14 and
   21, which may proceed to more aggressive eosinophilic chromophobe renal
   cell carcinoma (ChRCC). Oncocytomas activate 5' adenosine
   monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Tp53 (p53) and display
   disruption of Golgi and autophagy/lysosome trafficking, events
   attributed to defective mitochondrial function. This suggests that the
   genetic defects in mitochondria activate a metabolic checkpoint,
   producing autophagy impairment and mitochondrial accumulation that limit
   tumor progression, revealing a novel tumor- suppressive mechanism for
   mitochondrial inhibition with metformin. Alleviation of this metabolic
   checkpoint in type 2 by p53 mutations may allow progression to
   eosinophilic ChRCC, indicating that they represent higher risk.}},

Abstract = {{Pure indium oxide (In2O3) nanoparticles was synthesized by an
   inexpensive and solid state reaction method using indium nitrate in
   muffle furnace at 400 A degrees C for 4 h. The synthesized product was
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
   (FT-IR) spectroscopy, FT-Raman, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with
   energy dispersive spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron
   microscopy (HR-TEM), photoluminescence (PL) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. XRD
   pattern confirmed the crystalline nature and cubic structure of
   synthesized composition. Crystallite size, microstrain and dislocation
   density were evaluated from the XRD data. The functional groups present
   in the sample were identified by FT-IR spectroscopy. The vibrational
   modes of the product were investigated by FT-Raman spectrum. The
   microstructure and elemental identification were done by SEM with EDX
   analysis. The HR-TEM image depicts the morphology and size of the
   prepared nanoparticles. The blue shift in the absorption edge was
   observed from the UV-Vis spectrum. The PL spectrum showed two emission
   peaks corresponding to blue emission.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to compare plasma lidocaine concentrations when a
   commercially available 5\% lidocaine patch was placed on intact skin vs.
   an incision. Our hypothesis was that greater absorption of lidocaine
   would occur from the incision site compared to intact skin. Ten dogs
   were used in a crossover design. A patch was placed over an incision,
   and then after a washout period, a patch was placed over intact skin.
   Plasma lidocaine concentrations were measured at patch placement; 20, 40
   and 60min; and 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96h after patch
   placement. After patch removal, the skin was graded using a subjective
   skin reaction system. No dogs required rescue analgesia, and no toxicity
   or skin reaction was noted. Mean +/- SD AUC and C-MAX were 3054.29 +/-
   1095.93ng<bold>h</bold>/mL and 54.1 +/- 15.84ng/mL in the Incision
   Group, and 2269.9 +/- 1037.08ng<bold>h</bold>/mL and 44.5 +/- 16.34ng/mL
   in the No-Incision Group, respectively. The AUC was significantly higher
   in the Incision Group. The results of the study demonstrate that the
   actual body exposure to lidocaine was significantly higher when an
   incision was present compared to intact skin. No adverse effects were
   observed from either treatment. Efficacy was not evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{After being initially drafted in 2001 by an expert body-the
   International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty-the
   ``responsibility to protect{''} (R2P) doctrine has eventually found its
   way into the 2005 UN World Summit Outcome document, thereby replacing a
   morally controversial doctrine of ``humanitarian intervention{''}. The
   paper aims, first, to point out how these two doctrines are different
   ethical projects. Second, recognizing that it is safer to say that the
   doctrine has not become a principle of law, this paper tries to situate
   it within the prevalent value of the international rule of law. It does
   so by exploring two somewhat contrasting conceptions-one more
   substantive in nature, which takes individuals as ultimate beneficiaries
   of this value, and the other, more formal in nature, which puts states
   in the forefront. The R2P case shows, however, that neither of them can
   be advanced to the full extent.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological characteristics of gametogenesis, fertilization, and early
   larval development in Ostrea chilensis (Philippi, 1845) pose a number of
   challenges for selective breeding, despite strong commercial potential.
   In wild populations, this larviparous protandric hermaphrodite exhibits
   asynchronous gonadal maturation and relatively low fecundity.
   Reproductive success and genetic diversity in a hatchery population are
   primarily determined by female fecundity and fertility, as well as
   synchrony of female gonad development. Better hatchery control of the
   reproductive cycle can lead to more cost-effective and reliable
   breeding. This study examined factors such as feed and temperature in an
   attempt to increase reproductive rates and female sex ratios in brood
   stock. Oysters held under two different hatchery conditioning
   regimes-flow-through outdoor nursery ponds and temperature-controlled
   indoor tanks-spawned earlier and had higher reproductive rates than
   natural or farmed populations. Oysters were sampled over 6 months with
   histological analysis used to assess seasonal gamete patterns. Magnetic
   resonance imaging was also trialed and compared with histology findings.
   Significant increase in female gonad proportion and improved synchrony
   of egg maturation was observed through manipulation of feed and
   temperature. The implications of these findings for implementing a
   cost-effective selective breeding program in this species are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{In animal models, resident memory CD8 + T (Trm) cells assist in
   respiratory virus elimination but their importance in man has not been
   determined. Here, using experimental human respiratory syncytial virus
   (RSV) infection, we investigate systemic and local virus-specific CD8 +
   T-cell responses in adult volunteers. Having defined the immunodominance
   hierarchy, we analyse phenotype and function longitudinally in blood and
   by serial bronchoscopy. Despite rapid clinical recovery, we note
   surprisingly extensive lower airway inflammation with persistent viral
   antigen and cellular infiltrates. Pulmonary virus-specific CD8 + T cells
   display a CD69 + CD103 + Trm phenotype and accumulate to strikingly high
   frequencies into convalescence without continued proliferation. While
   these have a more highly differentiated phenotype, they express fewer
   cytotoxicity markers than in blood. Nevertheless, their abundance before
   infection correlates with reduced symptoms and viral load, implying that
   CD8 + Trm cells in the human lung can confer protection against severe
   respiratory viral disease when humoral immunity is overcome.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of rosemary
   essential oil (250-1000 ppm) or its leaves (0.5-2\%) on the quality of
   turkey sausage. The addition of essential oil had no significant effect
   on the sausage texture and colour parameters. A high rosemary leaves
   level resulted in an increase in sausage hardness and chewiness and a
   decrease in lightness (L{*}) with respect to the control sausage.
   Sensory evaluation indicated that rosemary essential oil and its leaves
   increased the taste and the aroma scores of turkey sausage depending on
   the concentration. The obtained results also showed that rosemary leaves
   (0.5\%) were more effective than essential oil in reducing total plate
   counts, TBARS, K-232, and K-270 values during chill storage, in
   comparison with the control product. This will contribute to reducing
   the use of chemical additives, which are badly perceived by consumers,

Abstract = {{Math learning disability (MLD) or developmental dyscalculia is a highly
   prevalent and persistent difficulty in learning arithmetic that may be
   explained by different cognitive mechanisms. The accuracy of the number
   sense has been implicated by some evidence as a core deficit in MLD.
   However, research on this topic has been mainly conducted in
   demographically selected samples, using arbitrary cut-off scores to
   characterize MLD. The clinical relevance of the association between
   number sense and MLD remains to be investigated. In this study, we aimed
   at assessing the stability of a number sense accuracy measure (w) across
   five experimental sessions, in two clinically defined cases of MLD.
   Stable measures of number sense accuracy estimate are required to
   clinically characterize subtypes of MLD and to make theoretical
   inferences regarding the underlying cognitive mechanisms. G. A. was a
   10-year-old boy with MLD in the context of dyslexia and phonological
   processing impairment and his performance remained steadily in the
   typical scores range. The performance of H. V., a 9-year-old girl with
   MLD associated with number sense inaccuracy, remained consistently
   impaired across measurements, with a nonsignificant tendency to worsen.
   Qualitatively, H. V.'s performance was also characterized by greater
   variability across sessions. Concomitant clinical observations suggested
   that H. V.'s difficulties could be aggravated by developing symptoms of
   mathematics anxiety. Results in these two cases are in line with the
   hypotheses that at least two reliable patterns of cognitive impairment
   may underlie math learning difficulties in MLD, one related to number
   sense inaccuracy and the other to phonological processing impairment.
   Additionally, it indicates the need for more translational research in
   order to examine the usefulness and validity of theoretical advances in
   numerical cognition to the clinical neuropsychological practice with
   MLD.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed phase amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon (a-Si:H and nc-Si:H)
   thin films were deposited by VHF-PECVD (60 MHz) using Argon (Ar) as the
   diluent of silane. These amorphous and crystalline silicon thin films
   were deposited by varying the argon dilution (f(Ar)) from 10-97.5\%
   while keeping other process parameters constant. The effects of argon
   dilution on deposition rate, structural and optical properties of
   micro/nanocrystalline silicon thin films are studied. It has been
   observed that the films deposited from f(Ar) 10-70\% showed the
   deposition rate >20 angstrom/s with the highest deposition rate achieved
   of similar to 25 angstrom/s. Structural characterization has been
   performed by micro-Raman analysis and Atomic force microscopy. Raman
   shift towards higher wave number (515 cm(-1)) with increase of f(Ar)
   indicates variation in crystallinity of silicon films. HRTEM studies
   revealed the distribution of grain size and the degree of crystallinity.
   Optical absorption spectroscopy confirmed the increase in band gap of
   the materials from 1.5 to 2.1 eV. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The morphology of an Antarctic soil population of Paraholosticha
   muscicola, type species of Paraholosticha, is described from life and
   after protargol preparation. The data agree rather well with that of
   relevant descriptions, but the total variability of several features is
   relatively high in this species. Paraholosticha ovata and P. lichenicola
   are very likely junior synonyms. In addition, we sequenced the SSU rRNA
   gene of P. muscicola and thus we can estimate for the first time the
   phylogenetic position of a member of the Keronopsidae, the sole
   hypotrichs that divide in cysts. The molecular data basically support
   the position derived from morphological concepts, that is, P. muscicola
   branches off outside the Dorsomarginalia because kinety fragmentation
   and dorsomarginal rows are lacking. However, as in many other molecular
   analyses, discrepancies with morphology-based hypothesis are present.
   The misclassification of Paraholosticha and its sister-group Keronopsis
   in the Keronidae, with Kerona pediculus as type species, is discussed.

Abstract = {{Characteristics of the printable materials, such as pH, viscosity and
   heterogeneity can be controlled by materials and their composition.
   Optimization of manufacturing printable material is a compulsory step to
   achieve high performance circuits. We fabricated various stabilizers
   containing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) of three different molecular
   weights (MW = 40,000, 360,000, and 1,300,000) dissolved in
   diethylenglycol (DEG) for dispersing and protecting Cu nanoparticles in
   paste. Cu paste was screen-printed on polyimide (PI) substrates and
   sintered at 200 degrees C and 300 degrees C, respectively. Adhesion
   strength between a Cu circuit and a PI substrate was evaluated by a
   roll-type 90 peel test. The fracture surface was observed by FE-SEM.
   Thermal behavior of stabilizers analyzed with DSC and TGA showed
   increase decomposition temperatures with decreasing PVP MWs. The
   adhesion strength and the electrical conductivity was inversely
   proportional to molecular weight of PVP at the sintering temperature of
   200 degrees C. The Cu paste containing 40,000 PVP MW showed the greatest
   adhesion strength of 0.11 N/mm and the lowest electrical resistivity of
   47.3 mu Omega . cm. Fracture surfaces show cohesive fracture modes at
   the lower PVP MWs after peel tests.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aim: The biosimilar of infliximab, CT-P13, has recently
   been shown to be equivalent to infliximab in both efficacy and safety in
   the treatment of rheumatologic diseases. However, no data are available
   with respect to the drug's efficacy in patients with inflammatory bowel
   disease (IBD). We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of CT-P13 in
   IBD patients
   Methods: This was a retrospective multicenter study including both
   anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) naive patients and patients who
   switched from the biologic originator to CT-P13.
   Results: In anti-TNF naive Crohn's disease (CD) patients (n = 32),
   clinical response and remission rates were 90.6\% and 68.8\% at week 2,
   90.6\% and 84.4\% at week 8, 95.5\% and 77.3\% at week 30, and 87.5\%
   and 75.0\% at week 54, respectively. In anti-TNF naive ulcerative
   colitis (UC) patients (n = 42), clinical response and remission rates
   were 76.2\% and 19.0\% at week 2, 81.0\% and 38.1\% at week 8, 91.3\%
   and 47.8\% at week 30, and 100\% and 50.0\% at week 54, respectively,
   while mucosal healing rates were 58.3\% at week 8, 66.7\% at week 30,
   and 66.7\% at week 54. The efficacy of CT-P13 was maintained in 92.6\%
   (25/27) of CD patients and in 66.7\% (6/9) of UC patients after
   switching from its originator. Adverse events related to CT-P13 occurred
   in 11.8\% of UC patients.
   Conclusions: CT-P13 appears to have comparable efficacy, safety, and
   interchangeability with its originator in the treatment of IBD. Further
   prospective studies with long-term follow-up periods will be needed to
   confirm the biosimilarity of CT-P13.}},

Abstract = {{New glass compositions were investigated in the binary system
   KPO3-Nb2O5. The glass forming domain was determined by melt-quenching of
   the starting nominal compositions and it has been experimentally
   observed that glass samples can be obtained between the molar
   compositions 95KPO(3)-5Nb(2)O(5) and 50KPO(3)-50Nb(2)O(5). Chemically
   stable compositions from 80KPO(3)-20Nb(2)O(5) to 50KPO(3)-50Nb(2)O(5)
   were characterized by DSC for determination of characteristic
   temperatures Tg, Tx, Tp and Tf. Glass transition temperatures strongly
   increase with Nb2O5 content whereas thermal stability against
   devitrification progressively decreases. Thermal data were used to
   suggest a structural model in which NbOx polyhedra are inserted inside
   the phosphate chains of PO4 units. For higher Nb2O5 contents, NbOx units
   progressively link together to form amorphous NbOx clusters, responsible
   for the yellow color and lower thermal stability against
   devitrification. For the composition 50KPO(3)-50Nb(2)O(5), it has been
   found that the first crystallization peak is related with precipitation
   of hexagonal Nb2O5 in the glass matrix whereas the high temperature
   exothermic peak is due to both phase transition of hexagonal niobium
   oxide to monoclinic niobium oxide and precipitation of niobium potassium
   phosphate K2Nb6P4O26.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Purpose: MS-30 is a triple tapered cemented femoral stem.
   Before 2005, it was used together with a solid centralizer. We wanted to
   investigate its effect on the migration behaviour and survivorship of
   polished stem with a minimum of 10 years.
   Methods: Twenty-seven hips in 26 patients were available for follow-up.
   The mean length of follow-up was 12.1 years. Clinical outcomes were
   documented with the Harris Hip Score. Radiographs were examined for
   evidence of aseptic loosening.
   Results: The average Harris Hip Score was 74.8. No stem was revised for
   aseptic loosening. Two stems (7.4\%) developed radiolucent lines of more
   than 2 mm width with osteolysis. The mean subsidence was 0.77 mm. The
   survival rate at the 10th postoperative year, with aseptic loosening as
   the end point, was 100\%.
   Conclusion: The polished MS-30 stem with a solid centralizer has a
   satisfactory long-term outcome. Its mean subsidence was less than that
   of other polished tapered stems reported in the literature.}},

   Vaccine-Induced Neutralizing Activity}},
Journal = {{HEPATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},

Pages = {{1670-1682}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C virus (HCV) neutralization occurring at the E2 region
   412-426 (EP-I) could be enhanced when antibodies directed specifically
   to the E2 region 434-446 (EP-II) were removed from serum samples of
   persistently infected patients and vaccinated chimpanzees, a phenomenon
   of so-called antibody interference. Here, we show that this type of
   interference can be observed in individuals after immunization with
   recombinant E1E2 proteins. One hundred twelve blinded serum samples from
   a phase I, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial using recombinant
   HCV E1E2 with MF59C.1 adjuvant in healthy HCV-negative adults were
   tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for binding reactivity to
   peptides representing the E2 regions 412-426 (EP-I) and 434-446 (EP-II).
   All samples were subsequently tested for neutralizing activity using
   cell-culture HCV 1a(H77)/2a chimera, HCV pseudotype particles (HCVpp)
   H77, and HCVpp HCV-1 after treatment to remove EP-II-specific antibodies
   or mock treatment with a control peptide. Among the 112 serum samples,
   we found 22 double positive (EP-I and EP-II), 6 EP-II positive only, 14
   EP-I positive only, and 70 double negative. Depleting EP-II antibodies
   from double-positive serum samples increased 50\% inhibitory dose (ID50)
   neutralizing antibody titers (up to 4.9-fold) in up to 72\% of samples
   (P <= 0.0005), contrasting with ID50 neutralization titer increases in 2
   of 70 double-negative samples (2.9\%; P > 0.5). In addition,
   EP-I-specific antibody levels in serum samples showed a significant
   correlation with ID50 neutralization titers when EP-II antibodies were
   removed (P < 0.0003). Conclusion: These data show that antibodies to the
   region 434-446 are induced during immunization of individuals with
   recombinant E1E2 proteins, and that these antibodies can mask effective
   neutralizing activity from EP-I-specific antibodies. Elicitation of
   EP-II-specific antibodies with interfering capacity should be avoided in
   producing an effective cross-neutralizing vaccine aimed at the
   HCV-envelope proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial wastes (spent alumina catalyst and steel converter slag) were
   utilized to prepare low-cost inorganic sorbents by thermal activation at
   temperatures ranging from 500 to 1000 degrees C. According to the
   results of X-ray diffraction analysis, high-temperature thermal
   activation of mixtures of spent alumina catalyst and steel converter
   slag in different ratios leads to the formation of new crystalline
   phases. The Ni2+, H2PO4- and NH4+ sorption properties of the prepared
   samples were investigated in separate batch experiments, employing
   initial analyte concentration of 10 mmol L-1. The steel converter slag
   samples calcined at 500 degrees C and 900 degrees C and the mixed sample
   (70\% spent alumina catalyst and 30\% steel converter slag) calcined at
   1000 degrees C exhibited maximum ion sorption capacities of 3.56 mmol
   Ni2+ g(-1), 3.28 mmol H-2 PO4+ g(-1) and 2.21 mmol NH4+ g(-1),
   respectively. The principal mechanisms of Ni2+ sorption were the
   substitution of Ca2+ ions by Ni2+ ions, precipitation at high pH and
   sorption on Fe3O4 and SiO2 surfaces present in the samples. The
   H2PO4-sorption was due mainly to the formation of calcium phosphates and
   sorption on Fe2O3 and SiO2 surfaces, whereas the removal of NH4+
   involved sorption on Al2O3 surfaces of the prepared samples. The results
   of the kinetics calculations showed that a second-order kinetic model
   offers a good fit for the present experimental data. The materials
   prepared from low-cost industrial wastes in this work have the ability
   to simultaneously remove NH4+, H-2 PO(4)(-)and Ni2+ ions from aqueous
   solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dy3+ and Eu3+ activated Ca3Y2Si3O12 phosphors were synthesized by the
   solid-state synthesis method. The phosphors were characterized by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), mechanoluminescence (ML), thermoluminescence (TL) and
   photoluminescence (PL) to determine structure and luminescence. For ML
   glow curves, only one peak was observed, as only one type of
   luminescence centre was formed during irradiation. The Ca3Y2Si3O12:Dy3+
   TL glow curve showed a single peak at 151.55 degrees C and the
   Ca3Y2Si3O12:Eu3+ TL glow curve peaked at 323 degrees C with a small peak
   at 192 degrees C, indicating that two types of traps were activated. The
   trapping parameters for both the samples were calculated using Chen's
   peak shape method. Dy3+-activated Ca3Y2Si3O12 showed emission at 482 and
   574 nm when excited by a 351 nm excitation wavelength, whereas the
   Eu3+-activated Ca3Y2Si3O12 phosphor PL emission spectra showed emission
   peaks at 613 nm, 591 nm, 580 nm when excited at 395 nm wavelength. When
   excited at 466 nm, prominent emission peaks were observed at their

Title = {{Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive conversion and microscopic
   polyangiitis development in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Background: Increasing evidence indicates that antineutrophil
   cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive conversion occurs in patients
   initially diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and as a
   result, some of these patients develop microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).
   However, the incidence density of these patients is not well known.
   Objectives: To explore the incidence of ANCA-positive conversion and
   development of MPA during the disease course in patients with IPF and to
   evaluate whether corticosteroid therapy reduces MPA development in
   patients with IPF with myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA positivity at
   diagnosis or who later acquire MPO-ANCA positivity.
   Methods: We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 504 Asian
   patients with IPF treated at our institution in Saitama, Japan.
   Results: Of the 504 patients with IPF, 20 (4.0\%) had MPO-ANCA and 16
   (3.2\%) had PR-3-ANCAwhen first evaluated. In 264 of 504 patients with
   IPF, ANCA was measured repeatedly and seroconversion to MPO-ANCA and
   PR3-ANCA occurred in 15 (5.7\%) and 14 (5.3\%) patients, respectively,
   and 9 of 35 patients who were either MPO-ANCA positive at IPF diagnosis
   or who subsequently seroconverted developed MPA. None of the nine
   patients who developed MPA had been previously treated with steroids.
   The incidence of MPA tended to be lower in patients treated than not
   treated with corticosteroids although this was not statistically
   significant.
   Conclusions: Some patients with IPF with MPO-ANCA positivity at IPF
   diagnosis or with MPO-ANCA-positive conversion during follow-up
   developed MPA. Clinical trials to determine whether corticosteroid
   therapy can reduce MPA development and prolong survival in
   MPOANCA-positive patients with IPF should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Tailor heat treated blanks (THTB) are a well-known approach to
   considerably enhance the forming limits of 6xxx-aluminum alloys. This is
   realized by locally adjusting the mechanical properties with regard to a
   forming operation using a short term heat treatment. However, the
   resulting temperature distribution unavoidably leads to distortion of
   the blank due to thermal expansion of the heated areas. This is
   challenging for automated processing of THTB since dimensional accuracy
   and stackability must be assured. In this work the influence of heating
   parameters, tool design and blank thickness on the distortion behavior
   of 6xxx THTB are investigated by laboratory experiments. To show that it
   is in principle possible to predict the distortion behavior in advance,
   a thermo-mechanical simulation is used to recalculate one of the
   findings. The results from laboratory experiments are transferred and
   validated on a near-series heating tool. It is demonstrated that
   distortion can be minimized and controlled in a way that automated
   processing of THTB becomes possible.}},

Abstract = {{Ngawi 1 is an undated but well-preserved Homo erectus calvaria from
   Java. Previous craniometric and morphological studies have shown its
   similarities to late Javanese H. erectus from Ngandong as well as
   Sambungmacan (Sm 1 {[}and Sm 3]). Some researchers emphasize their
   morphological homogeneity, and suggest that this
   `Ngandong/Sambungmacan/Ngawi group' is morphologically distinct from H.
   erectus from the Early Pleistocene of Sangiran and Trinil, possibly at a
   species-level. In this study, we reinvestigated Ngawi 1 based on the
   newly cleaned original specimen and using micro computed tomography with
   the aim of testing if such morphological discontinuity really exists
   within the Javanese fossil record. We metrically and non-metrically
   examined 33 cranial characters that are useful to distinguish earlier
   and later Javanese H. erectus. We also evaluated the morphology of the
   three Sambungmacan crania (Sm 1, 3, and 4) in the same way. The results
   of these and multivariate analyses support previous studies that Ngawi 1
   exhibits many characteristic features of Ngandong H. erectus. However,
   Ngawi 1 is more or less similar to earlier Javanese H. erectus in
   smaller cranial size, a weak but distinct supraglabellar depression, a
   relatively short temporal bone, limited posterior projection of the
   middle part of the occipital torus, a shallower and `roofed' mandibular
   fossa, and a smaller mastoid process. The three Sambungmacan crania also
   show general affinities to Ngandong, but are similar to earlier Javanese
   H. erectus in a few or more characters. Such slightly shifted character
   distribution is at least consistent with the hypothesis of continuous
   evolution of H. erectus through the Pleistocene of Java. This minor but
   potentially meaningful pattern of morphological variation should not be
   overlooked when a morphological group is defined for the specimens from
   Ngandong, Sambungmacan, and Ngawi. We also determined the endocranial
   volume of Ngawi 1 to be 959 cm(3).}},

Abstract = {{The damping of an oscillator is, next to the effective mass and the
   stiffness, one of the key parameters that determine its frequency
   response as well as its noise. Since there are numerous different
   applications for oscillating microstructures, there are also numerous
   requirements for the shape of the respective resonance peak. While
   fabricating the right mass and stiffness to obtain a desired resonance
   frequency is, in general, a basic task, designing a micro-oscillator
   featuring an intended damping is not trivial. We present a way of
   utilizing the surrounding air to adjust the passive damping of a
   laterally oscillating micromechanical system. This is shown to hold in a
   relatively wide range by comparing analytical models and finite volume
   method simulations with measurements of a number of
   micro-electro-mechanical test structures with optical readout. (C) 2015

Volume = {{90}},

Pages = {{114-140}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Pit graves with evidence of specific burial rites excavated in the
   Balkans and the Carpathians have long been attributed to the Yamnaya
   culture. These burials, dated to between 3100 and 2500 cal BC, are
   mainly distributed in the eastern European steppe zone between the
   eastern Carpathians and the area bordering the southern Urals. The
   presence of similar burials west of this zone has repeatedly been taken
   to be evidence of migration out of the steppes, although its course has
   been interpreted in a number of ways.
   Since I. Panayotov's comprehensive study of these burials, the number of
   burial mounds excavated in present-day Bulgaria has grown, which makes
   it possible to re-examine the pit burials within them. A total of 162
   graves possess characteristic traits of the Yamnaya culture. They can be
   divided into three regional groups, in the northwest, north-east and
   south of present-day Bulgaria.
   A series of C-14 determinations dates the establishment of the pit
   graves in all three regions to between 3100 and 2600 cal BC, which
   suggests that migrations took place over an extended period. In
   particular the custom of including vessels belonging to an indigenous
   culture among the grave goods of the Yamnaya burials in Thrace suggests
   that there were close contacts between the immigrants and the local
   population that lived in tell settlements.
   Stone stelae and the inclusion of spiral rings among the grave goods of
   the western Pontic burial complexes are traits that have been recorded
   in the burials of the Yamnaya Culture in the north-western Black Sea
   zone. This forms the starting point of a discussion examining the area
   of origin of presumably smaller population groups that migrated to
   present-day Bulgaria over several centuries. As far as the evidence -
   which still relies on burials only - allows, it appears that we are
   dealing with processes of communication between the local and the
   immigrant population. There is no archaeological evidence for the
   dominance of the steppe people repeatedly cited in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{A thick succession of fine-grained sediments in any sedimentary basin
   can serve as source (if organic-rich) and top seals. Both sealing and
   petroleum generation capacity of any fine-grained succession is
   dependent on compaction history (mechanical and chemical compactions) of
   the sediments. In the Egersund Basin, a thick succession of fine-grained
   sediments of Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous age overly Middle Jurassic
   reservoir sands. The Egersund Basin, however, has experienced a complex
   depositional and tectonic history, particularly, late exhumation
   (Neogene) which complicates the overall burial, thermal and pressure
   history.
   In this study, petrophysical and acoustic properties (bulk density and
   P-wave velocity) of 10 exploration wells from two neighboring blocks in
   the Egersund Basin were utilized to investigate compaction processes in
   the area. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) analyses from selected wells and available total
   organic carbon (TOC) data were used as guide to interpret the compaction
   processes and resulting rock properties.
   The results show that the transition from mechanical to chemical
   compaction is not sharp. The onset of chemical compaction imposes a
   measurable deviation in the burial depth trends of the petrophysical
   properties expected from purely mechanical compaction. The continuation
   of the depth related trends however, indicates that chemical compaction
   may occur in concurrent with continuing mechanical compaction. The
   observed compaction varies between the different clay dominated
   stratigraphic units; indicating that the major control on both
   mechanical and chemical compaction is the primary sediment composition.

Abstract = {{Wood falls on the ocean floor form chemosynthetic ecosystems that remain
   poorly studied compared with features such as hydrothermal vents or
   whale falls. In particular, the microbes forming the base of this unique
   ecosystem are not well characterized and the ecology of communities is
   not known. Here we use wood as a model to study microorganisms that
   establish and maintain a chemosynthetic ecosystem. We conducted both
   aquaria and in situ deep-sea experiments to test how different
   environmental constraints structure the assembly of bacterial, archaeal
   and fungal communities. We also measured changes in wood lipid
   concentrations and monitored sulfide production as a way to detect
   potential microbial activity. We show that wood falls are dynamic
   ecosystems with high spatial and temporal community turnover, and that
   the patterns of microbial colonization change depending on the scale of
   observation. The most illustrative example was the difference observed
   between pine and oak wood community dynamics. In pine, communities
   changed spatially, with strong differences in community composition
   between wood microhabitats, whereas in oak, communities changed more
   significantly with time of incubation. Changes in community assembly
   were reflected by changes in phylogenetic diversity that could be
   interpreted as shifts between assemblies ruled by species sorting to
   assemblies structured by competitive exclusion. These ecological
   interactions followed the dynamics of the potential microbial
   metabolisms accompanying wood degradation in the sea. Our work showed
   that wood is a good model for creating and manipulating chemosynthetic
   ecosystems in the laboratory, and attracting not only typical
   chemosynthetic microbes but also emblematic macrofaunal species.}},

Abstract = {{The highly conserved 16S rRNA (rrs) gene is generally used for bacterial
   identification. In organisms possessing multiple copies of rrs, high
   intra-genomic heterogeneity does not allow easy distinction among
   different species. In order to identify Vibrio species, a wide range of
   genes have been employed. There is an urgent requirement of a consensus
   gene, which can be used as biomarker for rapid identification. Eight
   sequenced genomes of Vibrio species were screened for selecting genes
   which were common among all the genomes. Out of 108 common genes, 24
   genes of sizes varying from 0.11 to 3.94 kb were subjected to in silico
   digestion with 10 type II restriction endonucleases (RE). A few unique
   genes-dapF, fadA, hisD, ilvH, lpxC, recF, recR, rph and ruvB in
   combination with certain REs provided unique digestion patterns, which
   can be used as biomarkers. This protocol can be exploited for rapid
   diagnosis of Vibrio species.}},

Abstract = {{There are problems in the delimitation/identification of Plectranthus
   species and this investigation aims to contribute toward solving such
   problems through structural and histochemical study of the trichomes.
   Considering the importance of P. zuluensis as restricted to semi-coastal
   forests of Natal that possess only two fertile stamens not four as the
   other species of this genus. The objective of this work was to study in
   detail the distribution, morphology and histochemistry of the foliar
   trichomes of this species using light and electron microscopy.
   Distribution and morphology of two types of non-glandular, capitate and
   peltate glandular trichomes are described on both leaf sides. This study
   provides a description of the different secretion modes of glandular
   trichomes. Results of histochemical tests showed a positive reaction to
   terpenoids, lipids, polysaccharides and phenolics in the glandular
   trichomes. We demonstrated that the presence, types and structure of
   glandular and non-glandular trichomes are important systematic criteria
   for the species delimitation in the genus.}},

   what it will look like. According to the Chinese leadership, the future
   models must be found from domestic soil and tradition. Traditionally,
   China was seen as a civilization at the center of All-Under-Heaven, a
   non-hegemonic power which relied to force only in order to protect
   itself against outside aggression. There are two upcoming centennials
   that serve as major milestones along the way to the rejuvenation, namely
   the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party in 2021,
   and the establishment of the People's Republic in 2049. The celebrations

Abstract = {{Graphene-based composites are attractive to effectively tune the

   study of band gap tuning and photoconductivity enhancement of reduced
   graphene oxide-Cu2SnS3 (G-CTS) composite. A simple solvothermal route
   has been used to synthesize G-CTS with and without a complexing agent in
   the reaction mixture. Raman and FTIR studies confirm the formation of
   G-CTS and reduced graphene oxide-Cu2SnS3 by the addition of complexing
   agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (G-CTS(E)) during synthesis.
   Powder X-ray diffraction reveals the formation of cubic CTS structure in
   both the composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study has
   revealed microbar and nanorod morphologies in the composites. The wide
   absorption of composites has been measured using absorption spectroscopy
   study. The band gaps of G-CTS and G-CTS(E) have been calculated using
   the absorption spectra and found to be 1.33 and 1.61 eV, respectively.
   This study confirms the suitability of G-CTS and G-CTS(E) for

Abstract = {{Background. Detailed knowledge of the dimensions and shape of the main
   arteries of the body and how they change with age and disease is
   important for understanding arterial pathophysiology and improving
   minimally invasive devices to treat arterial diseases. Our goal was to
   describe and compare geometric remodeling of the aorta and peripheral
   arteries in the context of patient demographics and cardiovascular risk
   factors.
   Methods. Three-dimensional reconstructions of computed tomography
   angiography scans were performed in 122 subjects 5-93 years of age (mean
   47 +/- 24 years, 64 M/58 F). Best-fit arterial diameters, lengths, and
   tortuosity for the principle named arteries in the chest, abdomen,
   pelvis, and upper thigh were measured, and multiple linear regression
   analysis was performed to examine how these morphologic parameters
   associate with patient demographics and risk factors.
   Results. Large elastic arteries increased their diameter, length, and
   tortuosity with age, whereas muscular arteries primarily became more
   tortuous. Demographics and risk factors explained > 70\% of the
   variation in diameters of the abdominal aorta, paravisceral aorta, and
   the aortic arch; and > 75 \% of variation in tortuosity from the
   profunda femoris to the brachiocephalic artery. Male sex, larger body
   mass index, and hypertension contributed to larger diameters, whereas
   the presence of diabetes was associated with somewhat-straighter
   arteries. Overall, the effects of cardiovascular risk factors on
   geometric remodeling were small compared with those of demographics.
   Conclusion. The geometry of the vascular tree is greatly affected by
   aging, demographics, and some risk factors. Elastic and muscular
   arteries remodel differently, possibly as the result of differences in
   their microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder, most
   frequently involving the lungs, skin, or eyes. Somatostatin receptor
   scintigraphy (SRS) can visualize sarcoid granulomas through binding of a
   radionuclide-coupled somatostatin analog to somatostatin receptors that
   are expressed in sarcoidosis. Uptake and patterns on SRS were studied
   and correlated to clinical and conventional findings.
   Patients and Methods Data of 218 SRSs undertaken for the analysis of
   potential sarcoidosis were studied. These scintigraphies were
   retrospectively studied on intensity uptake degrees and localization of
   sarcoidosis-associated lesions, and compared with conventional
   radiological techniques (chest x-ray and CT).
   Results In all but 1 of the 175 evaluable patients, SRS demonstrated
   uptake. In patients with thoracic sarcoidosis-associated lesions, SRS
   improved the yield of visualization of chest x-ray in 20 (36\%) and CT
   in 7 (32\%) of histologically unproven patients, and in 31 (30\%) and 8
   (14\%) of the histologically proven patients, respectively. Mediastinal
   lesions together with either eye, salivary glands, clavicular, or hilar
   localizations were most frequent demonstrated on SRS and constituted
   characteristic patterns. Exclusive extrapulmonary disease was found in
   6\% of the patients.
   Conclusions Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy enhances the yield of
   investigations in sarcoidosis patients and therefore provides a useful
   and sensitive imaging technique to monitor organ involvement and
   therapeutic efficacy in patients with sarcoidosis.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This study was designed to evaluate the characteristics of
   patients with medial plica syndrome and associated cartilage damage.
   Methods The study subjects included 44 patients with 57 knees
   arthroscopically diagnosed with medial plica syndrome. Subjects were
   divided into those with severe cartilage damage, defined as
   International Cartilage Research Society (ICRS) stage 2 or higher, and
   those with mild cartilage damage, defined as ICRS stage 1 or lower.
   Local findings, period from onset to surgery, arthroscopic findings, and
   postoperative results were compared in the two groups.
   Results The shapes of the medial synovial plica were types C and D of
   the Sakakibara classification in the severe group, and types A, B, and C
   in the mild group. Patellar ballottement tended to be more common in the
   severe than in the mild group (P = 0.059). The duration from onset to
   surgery was significantly longer in the severe than in the mild group
   (29.0 vs. 11.6 months, P = 0.043). Postoperative results were
   significantly better in the mild than in the severe group (P = 0.0017).
   Conclusions The shape of the medial synovial plica and the duration
   between symptom onset and surgery were associated with cartilage damage.
   Surgical treatment should be considered when the medial synovial plica
   covers part of the anterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle or
   ruptures, or when pain persists over a long period, thus reducing the
   potential for cartilage damage.}},

Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To explore the interrelationship and mediating effect of
   factors that are beneficial (i.e., antioxidants) and harmful (i.e.,
   inflammation and oxidative stress) to the relationship between sleep and
   cardiometabolic health.
   Design: Cross-sectional data from the 2005-2006 National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey.
   Setting: Nationally representative population sample from the US.
   Participants: Age >= 20 y with sleep data; final analytical sample of n
   = 2,079.
   Interventions: N/A.
   Measurements and Results: Metabolic syndrome was classified according to
   the Joint Interim Statement, and sleep duration was categorized as very
   short, short, adequate, and long sleepers (<= 4, 5-6, 7-8, and = 9 h per
   night, respectively). The indirect mediation effect was quantified as
   large (>= 0.25), moderate (>= 0.09), modest (>= 0.01), and weak (<
   0.01). In general, inflammation was above the current clinical reference
   range across all sleep duration categories, whereas oxidative stress was
   elevated among short and very short sleepers. Select sleep
   duration-cardiometabolic health relationships were mediated by
   C-reactive protein (CRP),gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), carotenoids,
   uric acid, and vitamins C and D, and were moderated by sex.
   Specifically, moderate-to-large indirect mediation by GGT, carotenoids,
   uric acid, and vitamin D were found for sleep duration-waist
   circumference and -systolic blood pressure relationships, whereas
   vitamin C was a moderate mediator of the sleep duration-diastolic blood
   pressure relationship.
   Conclusions: Several factors related to inflammation, oxidative stress,
   and antioxidant status were found to lie on the casual pathway of the
   sleep duration-cardiometabolic health relationship. Further longitudinal
   studies are needed to confirm our results.}},

Title = {{A simple accurate chest-compression depth gauge using magnetic coils
   during cardiopulmonary resuscitation}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a new method for calculating chest compression
   depth and a simple chest-compression gauge for validating the accuracy
   of the method. The chest-compression gauge has two plates incorporating
   two magnetic coils, a spring, and an accelerometer. The coils are
   located at both ends of the spring, and the accelerometer is set on the
   bottom plate. Waveforms obtained using the magnetic coils (hereafter,
   ``magnetic waveforms{''}), which are proportional to compression-force
   waveforms and the acceleration waveforms were measured at the same time.
   The weight factor expressing the relationship between the second
   derivatives of the magnetic waveforms and the measured acceleration
   waveforms was calculated. An estimated-compression-displacement (depth)
   waveform was obtained by multiplying the weight factor and the magnetic
   waveforms. Displacements of two large springs (with similar spring
   constants) within a thorax and displacements of a cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation training manikin were measured using the gauge to validate
   the accuracy of the calculated waveform. A laser-displacement detection
   system was used to compare the real displacement waveform and the
   estimated waveform. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between
   the real displacement using the laser system and the estimated
   displacement waveforms were calculated. The estimated displacement error
   of the compression depth was within 2 mm (<1 standard deviation). All
   ICCs (two springs and a manikin) were above 0.85 (0.99 in the case of
   one of the springs). The developed simple chest-compression gauge, based
   on a new calculation method, provides an accurate compression depth
   (estimation error < 2 mm). (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   lesion volume on perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI)
   obtained at hyperacute stage of ischemic stroke with subsequent cerebral
   ischemic events (SIEs) in patients with symptomatic steno-occlusion of
   major cerebral arteries. Using a prospective stroke registry database,
   patients arriving within 24 hours of onset with symptomatic
   steno-occlusion of major supratentorial cerebral arteries were
   identified. On baseline PWI, time-to-peak lesion volume (TTP-LV) was
   determined by a simple geometric method and dichotomized into the
   highest tertile (large) and the other tertiles (small to medium)
   according to the vascular territory of occluded arteries. Primary
   outcome was a time to SIE up to 1 year after stroke onset. A total of
   385 patients (a median time delay from onset to arrival, 2.2 hours) were
   enrolled. During the first year of stroke, the SIE rate of the large
   TTP-LV group was twice that of the small-to-medium TTP-LV group (35.7\%
   versus 17.4\%; P < .001). Large TTP-LV independently raised the hazard
   of SIE (hazard ratio, 2.24; 95\% confidence interval, 1.45-3.44). This
   study demonstrates that TTP-LV on PWI measured through a simple
   geometric method at an emergency setting can be used to predict
   progression or recurrence of ischemic stroke in patients with

Abstract = {{This paper presents a practical method for estimation of average
   temperature in the permanent magnet (PM) of electric machine by using
   fmite element analysis (FEA) and dynamo load experiment. First of all,
   the temperature effect of PM to the torque has been employed by FEA in
   order to evaluate the Temperature-Torque characteristic curve. The 1st
   order polynomial equation which is torque attenuation coefficient is
   derived by the FEA result of the Temperature-Torque curve. Next, torque
   saturation test with constant current condition is performed by dynamo
   load experiment. Then, the temperature trend can be estimated by adding
   the initial starting temperature using the torque attenuation
   coefficient and torque saturation curve. Lastly, estimated temperature
   is validated by infrared thermometer which measures temperature of PM
   surface. The comparison between the estimated result and experimental
   result gives a good agreement within a deviation of maximum 8 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Early analysis of timing is essential in the design of reliable avionics
   systems. We consider an environmental monitoring system that allows the
   surroundings of an aircraft to be observed continuously in real time. We
   analyze timing aspects of the partitions within the sensor and
   monitoring nodes, and of the intermediate switches that connect them. We
   use the application-specific I/O integration support tool (ASIIST) to
   evaluate the worst case delay in the peripheral component interconnect
   buses of the end nodes. We describe a novel switching algorithm that
   guarantees a bounded delay for any feasible traffic through each switch,
   and then derive the worst case delay incurred in a switched network that
   contains switches operating with the proposed algorithm. By composing
   these delays, we are able to determine the end-to-end delay over the
   internal buses and network comprising the entire system, and show how it
   can be bounded by using our switching algorithm. Our worst case
   end-to-end delay analysis contributes to more reliable and better
   verified environmental monitoring services over packet-switched networks
   in avionics systems. We expect that our work will help reduce the cost
   of designing and implementing environmental monitoring avionics systems,
   by making it easier to identify unsatisfactory designs at an early
   stage.}},

Abstract = {{High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is among the most lethal forms
   of cancer in women. By analyzing the mRNA-seq reads from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA), we uncovered a novel cancer-enriched chimeric RNA
   as the result of splicing between MUC1, a highly glycosylated
   transmembrane mucin, TRIM46, a tripartite motif containing protein, and
   KRTCAP2, a keratinocyte associated protein. Experimental analyses by
   RT-PCR (reverse transcription PCR) and Sanger sequencing using an
   in-house cohort of 59 HGSC patient tumors revealed a total of six
   MUC1-TRIM46-KRTCAP2 isoforms joined by different annotated splice sites
   between these genes. These chimeric isoforms are not detected in
   non-cancerous ovaries, yet are present in three out of every four HGSC
   patient tumors, a significant frequency given the exceedingly
   heterogeneous nature of this disease. Transfection of the cDNA of
   MUC1-TRIM46-KRTCAP2 isoforms in mammalian cells led to the translation
   of mutant MUC1 fusion proteins that are unglycosylated and
   cytoplasmically localized as opposed to the cell membrane, a feature
   resembling the tumor-associated MUC1. Because the parental MUC1 is
   overexpressed in 90\% of HGSC tumors and has been proposed as a clinical
   biomarker and therapeutic target, the chimeric MUC1-TRIM46-KRTCAP2
   isoforms identified in this report could represent significantly better
   MUC1 variants for the same clinical utilities.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of employing chaotic maps in building encryption schemes has
   attracted the attention of many researchers since the late 1980s. In
   1998, M.S. Baptista proposed an elegant encryption scheme based on a
   one-dimensional chaotic map. Many variants of this scheme have been
   proposed. Baptista's scheme and some of its variants have been subjected
   to cryptanalytic attacks such as the one-time pad attack and the entropy
   attack. We propose a variant of Baptista's encryption scheme based on
   two coupled one-dimensional chaotic maps, which also employs mixing,
   that is, every character in the ciphertext depends on all preceding
   plaintext characters. Our proposed scheme overcomes the aforementioned
   attacks. Empirical results show that this idea improves the performance
   of the scheme. Baptista's approach generates a ciphertext, which is
   generally larger than the plaintext, but the distribution of the
   ciphertext symbols allows compression. Simulation results verify that
   our proposed scheme accommodates better compression rates than the
   original scheme. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study was aimed at producing acetylated adipate of retrograded
   starch (ADA-R) with various degrees of substitution with functional
   groups and at determining the effect of esterification,degree on
   resistance and pasting characteristics of the produced preparations.
   Paste was prepared from native potato starch, and afterwards frozen and
   defrosted. After drying and disintegration, the paste was acetylated and
   crosslinked using various doses of reagents. An increase in the total
   degree of esterification of the produced ADA-R-preparation caused an
   increase in its resistance to the action of amyloglucosidase. Viscosity
   of the paste produced from ADA-R-preparation in a wide range of
   acetylation degrees was increasing along with increasing crosslinking of
   starch. The study demonstrated that acetylated adipate of retrograded
   starch may be classified as a preparation of RS 3/4 type resistant
   starch (retrograded starch/chemically-modified starch) with good
   texture-forming properties. The conducted modification offers the
   possibility of modeling the level of resistance of the produced
   preparation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Driver drowsiness and distraction are two main reasons for traffic
   accidents and the related financial losses. Therefore, researchers have
   been working for more than a decade on designing driver inattention
   monitoring systems. As a result, several detection techniques for the
   detection of both drowsiness and distraction have been proposed in the
   literature. Some of these techniques were successfully adopted and
   implemented by the leading car companies. This paper discusses and
   provides a comprehensive insight into the well-established techniques
   for driver inattention monitoring and introduces the use of most recent
   and futuristic solutions exploiting mobile technologies such as
   smartphones and wearable devices. Then, a proposal is made for the
   active of such systems into car-to-car communication to support
   vehicular ad hoc network's (VANET's) primary aim of safe driving. We
   call this approach the dissemination of driver behavior via C2C
   communication. Throughout this paper, the most remarkable studies of the
   last five years were examined thoroughly in order to reveal the recent
   driver monitoring techniques and demonstrate the basic pros and cons. In
   addition, the studies were categorized into two groups: driver
   drowsiness and distraction. Then, research on the driver drowsiness was
   further divided into two main subgroups based on the exploitation of
   either visual features or nonvisual features. A comprehensive
   compilation, including used features, classification methods, accuracy
   rates, system parameters, and environmental details, was represented as
   tables to highlight the (dis) advantages and/or limitations of the
   aforementioned categories. A similar approach was also taken for the
   methods used for the detection of driver distraction.}},

   taxa of the genera Achillea, Aegilops, Aira, Alopecurus, Avena,
   Bolboschoenus, Carex, Cladium, Elatine, Eleocharis, Eriophorum,
   Glyceria, Polypogon, Sclerochloa, Scheuchzeria, Sparganium, Tofieldia,
   Tragus and Viola. The maps are based on all available herbarium,
   literature and field records, which were stored at the CzechDistrib
   database, checked geographically and evaluated taxonomically, and shown
   in maps using the Central European mapping grid template derived from
   quadrants of 5 x 3 arc minutes (corresponding to approximately 5.5 x 5.9
   km). Many of these maps resulted from detailed revisions carried out
   during the work on the Flora of the Czech Republic. Maps of
   taxonomically difficult groups are based solely or mainly on herbarium
   specimens revised by taxonomic experts. If useful, recent versus old
   records, native versus alien occurrences, or records based on revised
   herbarium specimens versus all other records are distinguished using
   different symbols. Records used for producing maps are listed in
   electronic appendices. The maps are accompanied by texts that include an
   outline of general distribution, information on habitats and specific
   details on the distribution in the country. Where appropriate, comments
   on taxonomy, biology or spatial and temporal dynamics in distribution
   are given.}},

Abstract = {{Actinomycosis is a progressive, chronic, granulomatous and suppurative
   disease caused by different types of actinomyces. Instead of chronic
   suppurative disease, sinus formation can also be seen. Cervicofascial,
   abdominal and thoracal involvement can occur. Abdominal wall
   actinomycosis is an infrequent clinical form. Isolated anterior wall
   actinomycosis is a very rare form of the disease.
   This is an interventional case report.
   A 62-year-old female patient with abdominal mass was referred to
   hospital. She had diabetes mellitus. On the examination she had
   abdominal tenderness. The computerized tomography revealed an irregular
   density sized 6.5 x 5 x 3.5 cm in the umbilical area. Surgical
   debridement and incisional biopsy performed. The diagnosis is confirmed
   by histopathological examination. The patient received parenteral
   crystalline penicillin treatment and recovered.
   Physicians should consider abdominal wall actinomycosis in the cases of
   abdominal masses especially in immunosuppressive patients.}},

Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{Mood's test, which is a relatively old test (and the oldest
   non-parametric test among those tests in its class) for determining
   heterogeneity of variance, is still being widely used in different areas
   such as biometry, biostatistics and medicine. Although it is a popular
   test, it is not suitable for use on a two-way factorial design. In this
   paper, Mood's test is generalised to the 2x2 factorial design setting
   and its performance is compared with that of Klotz's test. The power and
   robustness of these tests are examined in detail by means of a
   simulation study with 10,000 replications. Based on the simulation
   results, the generalised Mood's and Klotz's tests can especially be
   recommended in settings in which the parent distribution is symmetric.
   As an example application we analyse data from a multi-factor
   agricultural system that involves chilli peppers, nematodes and yellow
   nutsedge. This example dataset suggests that the performance of the
   generalised Mood test is in agreement with that of the generalised
   Klotz's test.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Climate and, therefore, abiotic conditions, are changing rapidly, and
   many ecological interactions depend on them. In this study, how abiotic
   conditions mediate a predator-prey interaction were examined. 2.
   Caterpillars of Platyprepia virginalis (Boisduval) (Arctiidae) were
   found previously to be more abundant in wet habitats and thick litter
   cover compared with drier habitats and little or no litter. We
   hypothesised that wet litter provided caterpillars with refuges from an
   important ant predator, Formica lasioides. It was further hypothesised
   that caterpillars would be able to move at lower temperatures than ants,
   thus providing them with a thermal refuge. 3. In the lab, caterpillars
   were more likely to escape ant predation and survive on wet litter and
   at lower temperatures. At all temperatures, ant recruitment was lower in
   wet litter than dry litter although ants were more active on litter than
   bare soil. Thus, wet litter may serve as a habitat refuge for
   caterpillars from ants. 4. Caterpillars were able to maintain activity
   at temperatures 8-14 degrees C lower than F. lasioides. Thus colder
   temperatures may serve as a thermal refuge for caterpillars from ants.
   5. It was hypothesised that caterpillars can escape ant predation when
   precipitation causes wet litter and at temperatures that they experience
   commonly in the field. This mismatch between caterpillars and their
   predators in ability to tolerate wet litter and low temperatures may
   affect their field distribution and abundance. Expected future warmer
   and drier conditions may not provide these refuges.}},

Abstract = {{Calcined eggshell was evaluated as an inexpensive catalyst for selective
   oxidation of methane. Experiments were conducted using a packed bed
   reactor to determine the effects of oxygen on methane ratio (1,3 and 7),
   flow rate (0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 L/min), and temperature (650, 700, and 750
   degrees C) on methane conversion and selectivity. Our results suggested
   that partial oxidation of methane on calcined eggshell yielded higher
   hydrocarbons (C-2-C-7) via oxidative coupling with an average fractional
   methane conversion of similar to 30\%. Several factors including oxygen
   concentration, flow rate, and temperature were observed to influence
   fractional methane conversion and product selectivity. Catalyst
   characterization showed enhanced porosity and surface area upon
   calcination due to removal of organics and carbon dioxide. Surface
   deformation was observed in spent catalyst due to the physical impact of
   feed gas. Results from this research are expected to add value to
   eggshells and enhance agricultural waste management opportunities in
   areas where poultry industry is concentrated. (C) 2015 Taiwan Institute

Abstract = {{Small spatial differences in field conditions can strongly influence
   plant growth and create difficulties in terms of defining optimal crop
   management practices. Precision agriculture (PA) is considered to offer
   an optimal solution since it can adapt cultivation measures to
   small-scale in-field heterogeneity. Furthermore, it can potentially
   create environmental benefits through more efficient use of inputs.
   Since research on decision support is lacking with regard to the
   economic consequences of PA implementation, the authors use this
   heterogeneity as an indicator for an assessment of the benefits of PA. A
   new approach for using a site-specific heterogeneity indicator (HEI)
   that is linked to economics is presented. The HEI is defined as the
   coefficient of variation in annual field yield. Based on a study in East
   Germany between 2005 and 2007, an HEI threshold value of 17\% for
   profitable PA was identified based on individual and external benefits.
   Grounded in more detailed data, the HEI could serve as a useful
   decision-support tool for farmers in deciding whether or not to
   implement PA.}},

Title = {{Walking Training and Functioning Among Elderly Persons With Stroke:
   Results of a Prospective Cohort Study}},
Journal = {{PM\&R}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1205-1214}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To determine if 65- to 85-year-old persons who had a stroke
   within the previous 3-36 months can improve functioning and quality of
   life during walking rehabilitation.
   Design: Prospective cohort study with 6-month follow-up.
   Setting: Three inpatient rehabilitation centers and one outpatient
   rehabilitation center.
   Participants: A total of 147 persons who had sustained a stroke.
   Intervention: The multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention
   consisted of inpatient (20 days) or outpatient (18 days) rehabilitation
   with follow-up. Rehabilitation included walking exercises with and
   without body-weight support and conventional physiotherapy. After the
   rehabilitation period, participants received 10-15 individual
   physiotherapy sessions at outpatient clinics and guidance in home
   exercises.
   Measurements: The 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT), Berg Balance Scale
   (BBS), Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), Functional Status
   Questionnaire (FSQ), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), WHO Quality
   of Life (WHOQOL-BREF), and Sense of Coherence (SOC-13) were administered
   at the beginning of rehabilitation and at 6-month follow-up.
   Results: Walking distance (6MWT) improved by 17 +/- 51 meters (P <
   .001). The AMPS motor scale score improved by 0.15 +/- 0.65 logits (P =
   .010), the process scale score improved by 0.10 +/- 0.46 logits (P =
   .012), and the FSQ self-care score improved by 2.8 +/- 15.8 points (P =
   .039). The changes in the total (4.2 +/- 9.0), motor (3.7 +/- 8.0), and
   cognitive (0.5 +/- 2.0) scores of the FIM were statistically significant
   (P < .01). The BBS, WHOQOL-BREF, and SOC-13 remained unchanged.
   Conclusions: Walking distance and both self-reported and measured
   functioning improved during walking rehabilitation among elderly persons
   who had a stroke. Maintaining or improving functioning through
   rehabilitation and self-administered exercises may be important in
   supporting mobility and independent living outside institutional care.}},

Title = {{Whole-genome sequencing reveals activation-induced cytidine deaminase
   signatures during indolent chronic lymphocytic leukaemia evolution}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Patients with chromosome 13q deletion or normal cytogenetics represent
   the majority of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cases, yet have
   relatively few driver mutations. To better understand their genomic
   landscape, here we perform whole-genome sequencing on a cohort of
   patients enriched with these cytogenetic characteristics. Mutations in
   known CLL drivers are seen in only 33\% of this cohort, and associated
   with normal cytogenetics and unmutated IGHV. The most commonly mutated
   gene in our cohort, IGLL5, shows a mutational pattern suggestive of
   activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) activity. Unsupervised
   analysis of mutational signatures demonstrates the activities of
   canonical AID (c-AID), leading to clustered mutations near active
   transcriptional start sites; non-canonical AID (nc-AID), leading to
   genome-wide non-clustered mutations, and an ageing signature responsible
   for most mutations. Using mutation clonality to infer time of onset, we
   find that while ageing and c-AID activities are ongoing,
   nc-AID-associated mutations likely occur earlier in tumour evolution.}},

   Meta-Analysis}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL MEDICINE \& RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{117-138}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Several systematic reviews suggest that intermittent
   pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) chemotherapy is effective, but intensity
   (daily versus intermittent) and duration of rifampicin use (intensive
   phase only versus both phases) have not been distinguished. In addition,
   the various outcomes (success, failure, relapse, and default) have only
   selectively been evaluated.
   Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of proportions using all four
   outcomes as multi-category proportions to examine the effectiveness of
   WHO category 1 TB treatment regimens. Database searches of studies
   reporting treatment outcomes of HIV negative subjects were included and
   stratified by intensity of therapy and duration of rifampicin therapy.
   Using a bias-adjusted statistical model, we pooled proportions of the
   four treatment outcome categories using a method that handles
   multi-category proportions.
   Results: A total of 27 studies comprising of 48 data sets with 10,624
   participants were studied. Overall, treatment success was similar among
   patients treated with intermittent (I/I) (88\%) (95\% CI, 81-92) and
   daily (D/D) (90\%) (95\% CI, 84-95) regimens. Default was significantly
   less with I/I (0\%) (95\% CI, 0-2) compared to D/D regimens (5\%) (95\%
   CI, 1-9). Nevertheless, I/I relapse rates (7\%) (95\% CI, 3-11) were
   higher than D/ D relapse rates (1\%) (95\% CI, 0-3).
   Conclusion: Treatment regimens that are offered completely
   intermittently versus completely daily are associated with a trade-off
   between treatment relapse and treatment default. There is a possibility
   that I/I regimens can be improved by increasing treatment duration, and
   this needs to be urgently addressed by future studies.}},

Abstract = {{It has been documented that adaptation to hypoxia increases myocardial
   tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury depending on the regimen
   of adaptation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed during hypoxia play
   an important role in the induction of protective cardiac phenotype. On
   the other hand, the excess of ROS can contribute to tissue damage caused
   by I/R. Here we investigated the relationship between myocardial
   tolerance to I/R injury and transcription activity of major antioxidant
   genes, transcription factors, and oxidative stress in three different
   regimens of chronic hypoxia. Adult male Wistar rats were exposed to
   continuous normobaric hypoxia (FIO2 0.1) either continuously (CNH) or
   intermittently for 8 h/day (INH8) or 23 h/day (INH23) for 3 wk period. A
   control group was kept in room air. Myocardial infarct size was assessed
   in anesthetized open-chest animals subjected to 20 min coronary artery
   occlusion and 3 h reperfusion. Levels of mRNA transcripts and the ratio
   of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) were analyzed by
   real-time RT-PCR and by liquid chromatography, respectively. Whereas CNH
   as well as INH8 decreased infarct size, 1 h daily reoxygenation (INH23)
   abolished the cardioprotective effect and decreased GSH/GSSG ratio. The
   majority of mRNAs of antioxidant genes related to mitochondrial
   antioxidant defense (manganese superoxide dismutase, glutathione
   reductase, thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase, and peroxiredoxin 2) were
   upregulated in both cardioprotective regimens (CNH, INH8). In contrast,
   INH23 increased only PRX5, which was not sufficient to induce the
   cardioprotective phenotype. Our results suggest that the increased
   mitochondrial antioxidant defense plays an important role in
   cardioprotection afforded by chronic hypoxia.}},

Abstract = {{Gendered food security gaps between female- and male-headed households
   (FHHs and MHHs) can be decomposed into two sets of components: those
   explained by observable differences in levels of resource use, and those
   due to unobserved differences affecting the returns to the resources
   used. Employing exogenous switching ordered probit and binary probit
   regression models, this paper examines the gendered food security gap
   and its causes in rural Malawi. We conducted a counterfactual analysis
   and found that the food security of FHHs would improve significantly if
   they had the same levels of resource use as MHHs. However, even if FHHs
   had the same levels of resource use as MHHs, the gendered food security
   gap would not be closed because of the differences in the returns to
   those resources. Such differences in returns to resources explain 40 \%
   (45 \%) of the observed gendered chronic (transitory) food insecurity
   gap and 54 \% (19 \%) of the food break-even (surplus) gap. Further
   analysis suggests that the intensity with which sustainable agricultural
   practices have been adopted has a greater impact on the food security of
   FHHs than on MHHs.}},

Abstract = {{After decades of tension, relations between the People's Republic of
   China and Taiwan have improved dramatically in recent years. How durable
   is this detente? To what degree is armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait a
   continued possibility? Answering these questions requires grappling with
   the impact of several different trends in cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
   including a rapidly shifting balance of military power, deepening
   China-Taiwan economic integration, and changing Taiwanese views on
   sovereignty and identity issues. Taken together, these trends help to
   stabilize the cross-strait relationship. Nevertheless, this relationship
   has not been fundamentally transformed, and future trends could evolve
   in a way that again increases the danger of military conflict. In
   particular, a changing balance of military power in the Taiwan Strait
   has the potential to be highly destabilizing if it overtakes other
   trends such as economic integration.}},

Abstract = {{Despite prolonged survival and better quality of life as compared to
   dialysis, kidney transplantation frequently presents with a complex set
   of medical issues that require intensive management to protect graft
   function. Metabolic acidosis has an impact on several metabolic
   complications such as mineral and muscle metabolism, nutritional status
   and anemia. It may also have an effect on graft function, possibly
   through the stimulation of adaptive mechanisms aimed at maintaining
   acid-base homeostasis. We investigated current practice in the
   evaluation of metabolic acidosis at one of the largest transplant
   centers in the Eurotransplant region. Adult renal transplant recipients
   having received allograft from January 2011 to August 2012 were included
   in the investigation. We recorded the frequency of measuring the
   parameters of venous blood gas analysis, as well as creatinine and urea
   levels, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, calcium, phosphate and
   potassium blood levels, body mass index and the time spent on dialysis
   prior to kidney transplantation. Out of 203 patients who had received
   renal allograft at our institution during the observed period, 191 (124
   males and 67 females, age range from 18 to 77 years) were enrolled in
   the study. Of these, only 92 (48.167\%) patients had parameters of
   venous blood gas analysis measured at some time after kidney
   transplantation. Acid-base status was determined more often in males (77
   males vs. 22 females, p=0.001). Patients with pH/blood gas analysis
   performed were found to have significantly higher creatinine and urea
   levels and significantly lower creatinine clearance (p<0.001 both).
   Serum calcium levels were also significantly lower in this group of
   patients (p<0.001). Metabolic acidosis is a very important clinical
   issue that needs to be monitored in every transplant recipient. Its
   effects on graft function, nutritional status, anemia and bone mass are
   complex but can be successfully managed. Our study showed metabolic
   acidosis to be linked with significantly higher creatinine and urea
   levels, decreased creatinine clearance and lower calcium levels.
   Nevertheless, metabolic acidosis still stays a highly underestimated
   problem among nephrologists dealing with transplant recipients. We
   suggest regular determination of the acid-base status in renal
   transplant recipients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to report the incidence and
   associated risk factors of perioperative spinal cord ischemia (SCI)
   after endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs)
   with fenestrated and branched stent grafts.
   Methods: The study included consecutive patients with TAAA treated with
   fenestrated and branched stent grafts within the period January 2004 to
   December 2014. Suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms treated with
   fenestrated and branched grafts, even if including all four visceral
   vessels, were excluded. Patients who died within 30 days after the
   procedure were excluded from the analysis for SCI. All data were
   collected prospectively.
   Results: A total of 218 patients (167 men; mean age, 68.8 +/- 7.5 years)
   were treated. Thirty-day mortality was 17 patients (7.8\%). TAAA
   distribution among the 201 surviving patients was as follows: type I, n
   = 17 (8.5\%); type II, n = 55 (27.4\%); type III, n = 63 (31.3\%); type
   IV, n = 54 (26.9\%); and type V, n = 12 (5.9\%). In the surviving
   patients, 21 (10.4\%) developed perioperative SCI. At 30 days
   postoperatively, 13 (6.5\%) of those patients had transient lower limb
   weakness, 5 patients (2.5\%) had persistent lower limb weakness
   requiring assistance to stand or to walk, and 3 patients (1.5\%) had
   persistent paraplegia. Five of the 21 patients awoke from anesthesia
   with a neurologic deficit. The remaining 16 patients had a later
   postoperative onset of SCI, with the majority of them (14 of 16) within
   72 hours after the operation. Multivariate analysis using logistic
   regression identified operation time >300 minutes (odds ratio {[}OR],
   7.4; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 2.6-21.1; P <.001), peripheral
   arterial disease (OR, 6.6; 95\% CI, 2-21.9; P =.002), and baseline renal
   insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min; OR, 4.1; 95\% CI,
   1.1-16.1; P =.04) as independent risk factors for SCI.
   Conclusions: In our experience, most SCI events after endovascular TAAA
   repair are transient, with persistent paraplegia being rare. Patients
   with prolonged procedure duration, peripheral arterial disease, and
   baseline renal insufficiency appear to be at higher risk for development
   of SCI after endovascular TAAA repair.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminium supports strong and tunable surface plasmon resonances in the
   deep ultraviolet (DUV)-visible-near infrared (NIR) region. We have used
   theoretical modelling based on finite difference time domain (FDTD) to
   study localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and local field
   enhancement in isolated, dimer and multimer Al nanostructures. The
   spherical shape nanostructure shows a larger field enhancement in the
   DUV-UV region, whereas the anisotropic shape nanostructure shows a
   larger field enhancement with tunability in the peak wavelength towards
   the visible region. The extinction spectra and the electric field
   distribution profiles of interacting nanoparticles are compared with
   those of corresponding monomers to reveal the extent of plasmon
   coupling. The dimer configuration shows polarization-dependent higher
   field enhancement similar to 10(8) at 196 nm, whereas a multimer forming
   a rhombus shape nanostructure shows field enhancement similar to 10(7)
   at 411 nm. By optimizing size, interparticle separation and shape of the
   aluminium nanostructure, a larger field enhancement factor in the
   DUV-visible region can be achieved for sensitive surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) detection of biomolecules.}},

Abstract = {{This study is premised on the understanding that the authors of the
   Qumran Pesharim believed that rare words and word combinations held
   special-contextual meaning when found in sacred texts. In support of
   this concept it is shown that Pesher uses an exegetical technique in
   which scriptural verses identified through rare words contained within
   them, and which are lexically associated with the lemma through
   Stichworter, are themselves used to provide additional keywords. Through
   these keywords subsequent verses containing other rare or conspicuous
   words are identified which, although not directly associated with the
   lemma, are incorporated into the interpretation. ;This process could be
   repeated multiple times, i.e., cascading Stichworter, in order to
   ``reveal{''} a desired interpretation. In the cases presented, this very
   elegant hermeneutical method has the key benefit of explaining in an
   objective way not only the relationship between the lemma and the gloss
   but also the narrative flow of the gloss itself. Most importantly, it
   also provides a third level of understanding to the text: 1) lemma 2)
   gloss and 3) a newly revealed level consisting of the community's dogma,
   theological underpinnings, and kerygma. Further, this hermeneutical
   method allows for the understanding that the interpretation promulgated
   was revealed through the ``Word (davar) of God,{''} based on divinely
   placed markers which would alert the inspired-understanding reader to
   pay attention to their surrounding context and then make the required
   connections. This method is illustrated first in its simplest form with
   the use of the basic building blocks of this technique to contemporize
   scripture. Ultimately, it is shown that Pesher carries this technique a
   step further by using these units of hermeneutics to build on one
   another into what can be understood as a cascade of Stichwrter and word
   crafting which is presented in increasing levels of intricacy.}},

Abstract = {{Two explanations have been put forward to explain the observed
   conformity between the colours and specific star formation rates
   (SFR/M-{*}) of galaxies on large scales: (1) the formation times of
   their surrounding dark matter haloes are correlated (commonly referred
   to as `assembly bias'), (2) gas is heated over large scales at early
   times, leading to coherent modulation of cooling and star formation
   between well-separated galaxies (commonly referred to as `preheating').
   To distinguish between the pre-heating and assembly bias scenarios, we
   search for relics of energetic feedback events in the neighbourhood of
   central galaxies with different specific SFRs. We find a significant
   excess of very high mass (logM({*}) > 11.3) galaxies out to a distance
   of 2.5 Mpc around low SFR/M-{*} central galaxies compared to control
   samples of higher SFR/M{*} central galaxies with the same stellar mass
   and redshift. We also find that very massive galaxies in the
   neighbourhood of low-SFR/M-{*} galaxies have much higher probability of
   hosting radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). The radio-loud AGN
   fraction in neighbours with logM({*}) > 11.3 is four times higher around
   passive, non star-forming centrals at projected distances of 1 Mpc and
   two times higher at projected distances of 4 Mpc. Finally, we carry out
   an investigation of conformity effects in the recently publicly released
   Illustris cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, which includes
   energetic input both from quasars and from radio mode accretion on to
   black holes. We do not find conformity effects of comparable amplitude
   on large scales in the simulations and we propose that gas needs to be
   pushed out of dark matter haloes more efficiently at high redshifts.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to identify the Cryptosporidium parvum subtypes
   circulating in Polish cattle and their distribution in relation to the
   age and health status of tested animals. In total, 779 fecal samples
   were obtained from young cattle originating from 237 farms. C. parvum
   strains were identified at the 18 small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU
   rRNA), COWP, and LIB13 loci and were subsequently analyzed by sequencing
   at the 60-kDa glycoprotein (GP60) locus for subtype determination. The
   presence of 71 C. parvum strains belonging to IIa, IId, or IIl subtype
   families was shown. The strains from the IIa allele family prevailed
   with IIaA17G1R1, IIaA17G2R1, and IIaA15G2R1 subtypes occurring
   frequently. Two novel subtypes IIaA10G1R1 and IIlA19R3 were detected for
   the first time in a bovine host. The highest C. parvum prevalence (22.5
   \%, confidence interval (CI) = 2.5 \%) was observed among the youngest
   animals up to 2 weeks of age, followed by the prevalence among those
   aged 2 to 4 weeks (6.6 \%, CI = 2.6 \%) and then among older cattle (4.9
   \%, CI = 2.1). The occurrence of diarrhea in animals was associated with
   the presence of the IIaA16G1R1b subtype, while infections caused by
   IIaA15G2R1 strains were more likely to be asymptomatic. The geographical
   distribution of subtypes revealed that strains from the IIa subtype
   family were detected all over the country frequently compared to the IId
   and IIl subtypes, the sporadic appearances of which confirmed their
   endemic occurrence. Subtype analysis revealed the presence of zoonotic
   strains indicating cattle as a reservoir for human cryptosporidiosis.}},

Title = {{Estimation of radiation dose to patients from (18)FDG whole body PET/CT

Volume = {{142}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: There is a growing concern over the radiation
   exposure of patients from undergoing (18)FDG PET/CT
   (F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed
   tomography) whole body investigations. The aim of the present study was
   to study the kinetics of (18)FDG distributions and estimate the
   radiation dose received by patients undergoing (18)FDG whole body PET/CT
   investigations.
   Methods: Dynamic PET scans in different regions of the body were
   performed in 49 patients so as to measure percentage uptake of (18)FDG
   in brain, liver, spleen, adrenals, kidneys and stomach. The residence
   time in these organs was calculated and radiation dose was estimated
   using OLINDA software. The radiation dose from the CT component was
   computed using the software CT-Expo and measured using computed
   tomography dose index (CTDI) phantom and ionization chamber. As per the
   clinical protocol, the patients were refrained from eating and drinking
   for a minimum period of 4 h prior to the study.
   Results: The estimated residence time in males was 0.196 h (brain), 0.09
   h (liver), 0.007 h (spleen), 0.0006h (adrenals), 0.013 h (kidneys) and
   0.005 h (stomach) whereas it was 0.189 h (brain), 0.11 h (liver), 0.01 h
   (spleen), 0.0007 h (adrenals), 0.02 h (kidneys) and 0.004 h (stomach) in
   females. The effective dose was found to be 0.020 mSv/MBq in males and
   0.025 mSv/MBq in females from internally administered (18)FDG and 6.8
   mSv in males and 7.9 mSv in females from the CT component. For an
   administered activity of 370 MBq of (18)FDG, the effective dose from
   PET/CT investigations was estimated to be 14.2 mSv in males and 17.2 mSv
   in females.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: The present results did not demonstrate
   significant difference in the kinetics of (18)FDG distribution in male
   and female patients. The estimated PET/CT doses were found to be higher
   than many other conventional diagnostic radiology examinations
   suggesting that all efforts should be made to clinically justify and
   carefully weigh the risk-benefit ratios prior to every (18)FDG whole
   body PET/CT scan.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigate whether internal labor markets (ILMs) are
   associated with gender inequality in the Japanese workplace and whether
   their recent erosion has improved gender equality. Specifically, we used
   data over two decades from the Basic Surveys on Wage Structure to apply
   pooled ordinary least squares and fixed effect estimation to three
   indexes on gender equality and another three indexes of internal labor
   markets. We found that establishments with ILMs have significantly high
   gender inequality in their workplaces. That is, establishments with the
   lifetime employment system, the seniority wage systems, or the internal
   promotion system are likely to have large gender wage gaps, employ less
   female full-time workers, and have less female managers. However, these
   negative associations become much smaller or even disappear when we
   apply a fixed effect model using quasi-panel data. The erosion of ILMs
   may not be an important driving force of gender equalization, and
   establishments that have improved gender equality may not necessarily
   have moved away from ILMs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Urodele amphibians (newts and salamanders) and anuran amphibians (frogs)
   are excellent research models to reveal mechanisms of three-dimensional
   organ regeneration since they have exceptionally high regenerative
   capacity among tetrapods. However, the difficulty in manipulating gene
   expression in cells in a spatially restricted manner has so far hindered
   elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of organ regeneration in
   amphibians. Recently, local heat shock by laser irradiation has enabled
   local gene induction even at the single-cell level in teleost fishes,
   nematodes, fruit flies and plants. In this study, local heat shock was
   made with infrared laser irradiation (IR-LEGO) by using a gene
   expression inducible system in transgenic animals containing a heat
   shock promoter, and gene expression was successfully induced only in the
   target region of two amphibian species, Xenopus laevis and Pleurodeles
   waltl (a newt), at postembryonic stages. Furthermore, we induced
   spatially restricted but wider gene expression in Xenopus laevis
   tadpoles and froglets by applying local heat shock by a
   temperature-controlled metal probe (temperature stimulator). The local
   gene manipulation systems, the IR-LEGO and the temperature stimulator,
   enable us to do a rigorous cell lineage trace with the combination of
   the Cre-LoxP system as well as to analyze gene function in a target
   region or cells with less off-target effects in the study of amphibian
   regeneration.}},

   a Low-Risk Population with the Use of Aspirin A Randomized Trial}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Historically, venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the setting
   of elective knee arthroscopy has been considered rare. However, more
   recently, the rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been reported to be
   approximately 10\%. With increasing recognition of the potential for the
   development of thromboembolic events, several randomized trials have
   evaluated the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis in reducing the risk of VTE
   following knee arthroscopy. However, all of these studies have evaluated
   the efficacy of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), with reductions in
   the risk of DVT ranging from 65\% to 93\%, but with the potential side
   effect of bleeding. At the present time, there have been no randomized
   studies reported evaluating the utility of aspirin, an agent with a
   reportedly lower bleeding risk than LMWH, as pharmacologic prophylaxis
   against VTE after arthroscopic knee surgery.
   Methods: In a single-center, randomized, single-blind prospective trial,
   the efficacy of aspirin as postoperative pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis
   was evaluated in a low risk population undergoing knee arthroscopy. One
   hundred seventy patients were randomized to a treatment group of 325 mg
   of aspirin daily for 14 days postoperatively (66 patients) or to the
   control group with no intervention (104 patients). Bilateral, whole leg,
   compression venous duplex ultrasonography was performed 10 to 14 days
   postoperatively to document the incidence of DVT. The primary endpoint
   of the current study was the development of DVT or pulmonary embolism
   (PE), and the secondary endpoint was the development of a postoperative
   complication.
   Results: The study cohort was comprised of 104 males (61\%) and 66
   females (39\%) with a mean age of 44.4 +/- 14.4 years (range: 18 to 75
   years). Within both the aspirin treatment and control groups, the
   surgical procedures included meniscectomy, ACL reconstruction,
   chondroplasty, and meniscus repair. No cases of postoperative deep vein
   thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) were identified in either
   arm of the study during the observation period. Twenty-three patients
   experienced a complication, including pain or swelling (9\%), residual
   joint line tenderness (3\%), arthrofibrosis (0.6\%), and instability
   after a fall (0.6\%). Three patients developed knee swelling, two of
   them in the aspirin group and one of whom required a knee aspiration.
   However, there was no difference in the development of complications
   between the two patient populations (p = 0.76, odds ratio {[}OR] 1.14,
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.5-2.56).
   Conclusions: With no cases of VTE identified in our patient population,
   the use of aspirin in a low-risk population undergoing arthroscopic knee
   surgery is not warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Breast myofibroblastomas (MFBs) are rare benign tumors that have
   recently been recognized as a distinct entity. They are more common in
   men and often coexist with gynecomastia. Fine needle aspiration cytology
   or core biopsy should always be performed for triple assessment;
   however, due to the multiple variants of the tumor, final diagnosis can
   be safely accomplished only postoperatively with the aid of
   immunohistochemistry. The main histological characteristic that
   differentiates MFBs from the majority of malignant mesenchymal breast
   lesions is the presence of spindle cells in a collagenous background.
   Low mitotic activity and vimentin and CD34 positivity have been reported
   as well. Surgical excision retains a pivotal diagnostic and curative
   role. Local resection is sufficient, but mastectomy can also be
   advocated either in cases of male patients with coexisting gynecomastia
   or in females with large tumors. Into this retrospective survey, three
   cases of breast MFB were consecutively enrolled. Two patients were
   postmenopausal females and one was male. Relevant literature is briefly
   reviewed. Clinical features, histogenesis, morphological, and
   immunochemical findings are discussed, while the role of the current
   diagnostic and therapeutic management of this uncommon neoplasm is
   emphasized.}},

   Erfordernishochdruck zur Sicherung einer hamodynamisch ausreichenden
   retinalen Blutversorgung und sekundarprophylaktischer einfacher
   Thrombozytenfunktionshemmung traten keine weiteren Sehstorungen mehr
   auf. Die hamodynamisch relevante Zentralarterienstenose bildete sich im
   Sinne einer vollstandigen Rekanalisation innerhalb von 4 Wochen
   anhaltend und vollstandig zuruck. Evidenzbasierte Therapien einer
   symptomatischen Zentralarterienstenose liegen bislang wie auch beim
   embolisch verursachten Zentralarterienverschluss nicht vor, so dass
   prospektive Studien zur Evaluation einer standardisierten Behandlung
   dieses vaskularen Notfalls erforderlich sein werden.
   Abstract The hemodynamic amaurosis fugax is not caused by complete
   occlusion, but a significantly altered and decreased flow in the central
   retinal artery. Most commonly, this is caused by high-grade stenosis of
   the proximal internal carotid artery. The case presented here documents
   a further but rare differential diagnosis of recurrent transient
   monocular blindness, namely a hemodynamically relevant, symptomatic and
   high-grade stenosis of the distal central retinal artery of
   non-vasculitic but probably of embolic origin. Orbital color duplex
   sonography of the central retinal artery is shown to be a powerful
   diagnostic tool to confirm the hemodynamic relevance of this special
   pathology in retrobulbar and retinal arteries. Ultrasound investigation
   enables monitoring of therapeutic effects due to its high reliability.
   Based on ultrasound findings, the patient was treated for hypertension
   to ensure sufficient retinal blood supply, which was initially well
   tolerated and administered a single platelet inhibitor for secondary
   prevention; this treatment led to complete remission of ocular symptoms.
   Within a follow-up period of four weeks, there was a complete
   recanalization of the stenosis of the central retina artery. Because
   there are no generally established or evidence-based therapeutic
   concepts for symptomatic stenosis and occlusion of the central retina
   artery, further controlled trials will be necessary to establish a valid
   and standardized treatment for this vascular emergency.}},

Volume = {{166}},
Pages = {{237-246}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Raw, heated and frozen-thawed apple parenchyma of the `Golden Delicious'
   and `Granny Smith' varieties were subjected to leaching and phenolic
   compounds were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC). Fick's second law was applied for the determination of the
   apparent diffusivity (D-e) of individual polyphenols. Further
   information was obtained histochemically by means of toluidine blue O
   staining and image analysis.
   No difference in phenolic quantification existed between the biochemical
   and histochemical approaches. The histochemical analysis revealed cell
   structure changes and the interaction of procyanidins with the cell wall
   during the leaching process. The D-e values of the total polyphenols
   were 0.30 and 0.26 x 10(-9) m(-2) s(-1) for the `Golden Delicious' and
   `Granny Smith' raw apple matrix, respectively.
   The D-e values (and leaching yields) increased after treatments that
   degraded the plant tissue matrix. After freeze-thaw, the D-e values
   became 0.39 and 0.40 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-1), while after heating they were
   0.92 and 0.38 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-1). There was also an influence of the
   phenolic compound nature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Capturing the post-exertional exacerbation of fatigue following physical
   and cognitive challenge in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To design and validate an instrument to capture the
   characteristic post-exertional exacerbation of fatigue in patients with
   chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
   Methods: Firstly, patients with CFS (N = 19) participated in five focus
   group discussions to jointly explore the nature of fatigue and dynamic
   changes after activity, and inform development of a self-report
   instrument the - Fatigue and Energy Scale (FES). The psychometric
   properties of the FES were then examined in two case-control challenge
   studies: a physically-demanding challenge (moderate-intensity aerobic
   exercise; N = 10 patients), and a cognitively-demanding challenge
   (simulated driving; N = 11 patients). Finally, ecological validity was
   evaluated by recording in association with tasks of daily living (N =
   9).
   Results: Common descriptors for fatigue included `exhaustion',
   `tiredness', `drained of energy', `heaviness in the limbs', and `foggy
   in the head'. Based on the qualitative data, fatigue was conceptualised
   as consisting of `physical' and `cognitive' dimensions. Analysis of the
   psychometric properties of the FES showed good sensitivity to the
   changing symptoms during a post-exertional exacerbation of fatigue
   following both physical exercise and driving simulation challenges, as
   well as tasks of daily living.
   Conclusion: The `fatigue' experienced by patients with CFS covers both
   physical and cognitive components. The FES captured the phenomenon of a
   post-exertional exacerbation of fatigue commonly reported by patients
   with CFS. The characteristics of the symptom response to physical and
   cognitive challenges were similar. Both the FES and the challenge
   paradigms offer key tools to reliably investigate biological correlates
   of the dynamic changes in fatigue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights

Abstract = {{The prevailing reductive chemistry of Sm(II) has been accessed and
   explored mostly by the use of samarocene precursors. The highly reducing
   character of these congeners, along with their Lewis acidity and
   predominantly ionic bonding, allows for the relatively facile activation
   of C-H bonds, as well as peculiar transformations of unsaturated
   substrates (e.g., C-C couplings). Among other important C-C coupling
   reactions, the reaction of phenylacetylene with different mono-or
   bimetallic samarocene complexes affords trienediyl complexes of the type
   \{{[}(C5Me5)(2)Sm](2)(mu-eta(2):eta(2)-PhC4Ph)\}. In contrast, when
   t-butylacetylene is used, uncoupled monomers of the type
   (C5Me5)(2)Sm(C=C-Bu-t) were obtained. Although this type of reactivity
   may appear to be simple, the mechanism underlying these transformations
   is complex. This conclusion is drawn from the density functional theory
   (DFT) mechanistic studies presented herein. The operating mechanistic
   paths consist of: (i) the oxidation of each samarium center and the
   concomitant double reduction of the alkyne to afford a binuclear
   intermediate; (ii) the C-H scission of the acetylinic bond that lies in
   between the two metals; (iii) a dual metal sigma-bond metathesis (DM
   vertical bar sigma-SBM) process that releases H-2; and eventually (iv)
   the C-C coupling of the two bridged mu-alkynides to give the final
   bimetallic trienediyl complexes. For the latter mechanistic route, the
   experimentally used phenylacetylene was considered first as well as the
   aliphatic hex-1-yne. More interestingly, we shed light into the

Journal = {{PALLIATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{950-958}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The role of oxygen therapy to palliate dyspnoea is
   controversial. Without a clear evidence base oxygen is commonly
   prescribed, sometimes to the detriment of patients. This use of oxygen
   appears to be an entrenched culture, the roots of which remain obscure.
   Aim: To explore healthcare professionals' perceptions of oxygen therapy
   in palliative care.
   Design: Interpretative phenomenological analysis study utilising
   semi-structured interviews to explore beliefs and behaviours of
   healthcare professionals regarding palliative oxygen therapy. Data were
   recorded, transcribed and analysed using interpretative phenomenological
   analysis.
   Setting/participants: A total of 34 healthcare professionals, including
   doctors, nurses, pharmacists and paramedics in the United Kingdom, who
   were involved in prescribing, or administering, oxygen therapy to
   palliate dyspnoea.
   Results: Most healthcare professionals in this study were well informed
   about oxygen therapy; all recognised the role of oxygen in palliative
   care setting as important. The overarching theme of compassion
   identified sub-themes of comfort', do anything and everything' and
   family benefit'. However, the use of oxygen in the palliative care
   setting was not without its dilemmas, as additional sub-themes of
   controversy', doubt' and dependency' illustrated.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that oxygen therapy in palliative care
   poses an on-going dilemma for healthcare professionals striving to
   provide optimum care. It seems patients and families often expect and
   welcome oxygen, but the perception of oxygen as a solution to dyspnoea
   can conflict with healthcare professionals' own doubt and experiences.
   There appears to be an emotional cost associated with this dilemma and
   the choices that need to be made.}},

Abstract = {{The strong association between t(14;18) translocation and follicular
   lymphoma (FL) is well known. However, the determinants of this
   chromosomal aberration and their role in t(14;18) associated FL remain
   to be established.
   t(14;18) frequency within the B cell lymphoma 2 major breakpoint region
   was determined for 135 incident FL cases and 251 healthy controls as
   part of a nested case-control study within the European Prospective
   Investigation into Cancer cohort. Quantitative real-time PCR was
   performed in DNA extracted from blood samples taken at recruitment. The
   relationship between prevalence and frequency of the translocation with
   baseline anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary factors in cases and
   controls was determined. Unconditional logistic regression was used to
   explore whether the risk of FL associated with these factors differed in
   t(14;18)(+) as compared to t(14;18)(-) cases.
   Among incident FL cases, educational level (chi (2) p = 0.021) and
   height (chi (2) p = 0.025) were positively associated with t(14;18)
   prevalence, and cases with high frequencies {[}t(14;18)(HF)] were
   significantly taller (t test p value = 0.006). These findings were not
   replicated in the control population, although there were a number of
   significant associations with dietary variables. Further analyses
   revealed that height was a significant risk factor for t(14;18)(+) FL
   {[}OR 6.31 (95 \% CI 2.11, 18.9) in the tallest versus the shortest
   quartile], but not t(14;18)(-) cases.
   These findings suggest a potential role for lifestyle factors in the
   prevalence and frequency of the t(14;18) translocation. The observation
   that the etiology of FL may differ by t(14;18) status, particularly with
   regard to height, supports the subdivision of FL by translocation
   status.}},

Abstract = {{This first article of a two-article series describes a framework and
   life cycle-based model for typical almond orchard production systems for
   California, where more than 80\% of commercial almonds on the world
   market are produced. The comprehensive, multiyear, life cycle-based
   model includes orchard establishment and removal; field operations and
   inputs; emissions from orchard soils; and transport and utilization of
   co-products. These processes are analyzed to yield a life cycle
   inventory of energy use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, criteria air
   pollutants, and direct water use from field to factory gate. Results
   show that 1 kilogram (kg) of raw almonds and associated co-products of
   hulls, shells, and woody biomass require 35 megajoules (MJ) of energy
   and result in 1.6 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) of GHG
   emissions. Nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation water are the dominant
   causes of both energy use and GHG emissions. Co-product credits play an
   important role in estimating the life cycle environmental impacts
   attributable to almonds alone; using displacement methods results in net
   energy and emissions of 29 MJ and 0.9 kg CO2-eq/kg. The largest sources
   of credits are from orchard biomass and shells used in electricity
   generation, which are modeled as displacing average California
   electricity. Using economic allocation methods produces significantly
   different results; 1 kg of almonds is responsible for 33 MJ of energy
   and 1.5 kg CO2-eq emissions. Uncertainty analysis of important
   parameters and assumptions, as well as temporary carbon storage in
   orchard trees and soils, are explored in the second article of this
   two-part article series.}},

Pages = {{3117-3125}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The role of theory within ecology has changed dramatically in recent
   decades. Once primarily a source of qualitative conceptual framing,
   ecological theories and models are now often used to develop
   quantitative explanations of empirical patterns and to project future
   dynamics of specific ecological systems. In this essay, I recount my own
   experience of this transformation, in which accelerating computing power
   and the widespread incorporation of stochastic processes into ecological
   theory combined to create some novel integration of mathematical and
   statistical models. This stronger integration drives theory towards
   incorporating more biological realism, and I explore ways in which we
   can grapple with that realism to generate new general theoretical
   insights. This enhanced realism, in turn, may lead to frameworks for
   projecting ecological responses to anthropogenic change, which is,
   arguably, the central challenge for 21st-century ecology. In an era of
   big data and synthesis, ecologists are increasingly seeking to infer
   causality from observational data; but conventional biometry provides
   few tools for this project. This is a realm where theorists can and
   should play an important role, and I close by pointing towards some
   analytical and philosophical approaches developed in our sister
   discipline of economics that address this very problem. While I make no
   grand prognostications about the likely discoveries of ecological theory
   over the coming century, you will find in this essay a scattering of
   more or less far-fetched ideas that I, at least, think are interesting
   and (possibly) fruitful directions for our field.}},

Title = {{Utility of opposed-phase magnetic resonance imaging in differentiating

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the utility of opposed-phase magnetic resonance
   imaging (OP MRI) in differentiating malignant from benign bone lesions.
   Materials and methods: MRI scans of musculoskeletal lesions including
   opposed-phase imaging sequences were reviewed by both an experienced
   musculoskeletal attending radiologist, and a second year radiology
   resident. The change in signal from IP to OP images was measured. The
   reviewers' evaluation of the lesions based on T1 and T2-weighted images
   was compared to their evaluation with inclusion of the OP sequences.
   Results: Twenty-seven lesions in bone were analyzed: 4 malignant primary
   bone lesions, 3 malignant soft tissue lesions to bone, 3 metastases from
   visceral malignancies, and 17 benign bone lesions. Benign lesions of
   bone dropped in signal on OP imaging by an average of 37.1\%. Five of
   the benign lesions decreased in signal by less than 20\%, and two
   increased. Malignant bone lesions dropped in signal by an average of
   0.69\% with one of the ten lesions showing a greater than 20\% drop.
   When OP sequences were included, concern for malignancy decreased in
   benign lesions and increased in malignant lesions, for both the resident
   and attending. Compared with standard MRI, inclusion of these sequences
   increased the overall confidence in diagnosis for both reviewers.
   Conclusion: Opposed-phase imaging is helpful in differentiating benign
   from malignant lesions in bone. Confidence in diagnosis rose for both
   the attending and the resident as result of the inclusion of OP
   sequences. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.}},

Abstract = {{Excited state absorption (ESA) is a process that occurs in many laser
   gain media and can significantly impact their efficiencies of operation.
   In this work we develop a model to quantify the effect of ESA at the
   pump wavelength on laser efficiency, threshold and heating. In an
   analysis based on the common end pumped laser geometry we derive
   solutions and analytical expressions that model the laser behaviour.
   From these solutions we discuss the main parameters affecting
   efficiency, such as the laser cavity loss, pump ESA cross section and
   stimulated emission cross section. Methodologies are described to
   minimise the impact of pump ESA, for example by minimising cavity loss.
   It is also shown that altering the pumping geometry can significantly
   improve performance by improved distribution of the population
   inversion. Double end pumping can approximately halve the effect of pump
   ESA compared to single end pumping, and side pumping also has the
   potential to arbitrarily reduce its effect.}},

Abstract = {{This research is an attempt to compare the views of Farabi and Ibn Sina
   on the question of happiness, which is discussed in two parts: the
   definition of happiness and its relation to the faculties of the soul.
   Farabi has suggested five definitions and Ibn Sina one definition for
   happiness. It will be shown that in some respects the definition of Ibn
   Sina and in some others those of Farabi are more to the point. In regard
   to semantics, Farabi uses a few terms such as good, joy, and true
   wisdom, while Ibn Sina employs such terms as joy, perfection, good,
   reward, and achievement as equal to happiness. In regard to the
   relationship between happiness and the faculties of the soul, Farabi
   holds that experiencing happiness is confined to the theoretical
   rational faculty of the soul and the other faculties cannot understand
   happiness, whereas Ibn Sina argues that all the faculties of the soul
   have the ability to acquire happiness, and the happiness of each faculty
   lies in the actuality of its potentials.}},

Journal = {{SPORTS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},

Pages = {{217-226}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The human foot is subjected to ground reaction forces during running.
   These forces have been studied for decades to reduce the related
   injuries and increase comfort. A four-degree-of-freedom system has been
   used in the literature to simulate the human body motion during the
   touch-down. However, there are still inconsistencies between the
   simulation results and experimental measurements. In this study, an
   optimization technique is proposed to obtain the required parameters to
   estimate the vertical ground reaction force using the measurements from
   actual runners. The touch-down velocities of the rigid and wobbling body
   masses were also treated as optimization variables. It was shown that
   the proposed parameters can be adjusted to represent a particular shoe
   type. Specifically, vertical ground reaction force parameters and
   touch-down velocities were obtained for shoes with various insole
   properties and cushioning technologies. The results of this study
   suggest that the human locomotion system reacts to the shoe properties
   by regulating the velocities of the body wobbling and rigid masses. The
   magnitude and the load rate obtained using the proposed parameters are
   consistent with the experimental data. It is shown that the viscoelastic
   properties of the shoe will significantly affect the load rate but not
   the load magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) have been shown to be associated
   with the development of late-life depression (LLD) and eventual
   treatment outcomes. This study sought to investigate longitudinal WMH
   changes in patients with LLD during a 12-week antidepressant treatment
   course. Forty-seven depressed elderly patients were included in this
   analysis. All depressed subjects started pharmacological treatment for
   depression shortly after a baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   scan. At 12 weeks, patients underwent a follow-up MRI scan, and were
   categorized as either treatment remitters (n = 23) or non-remitters (n =
   24). Among all patients, there was as a significant increase in WMHs
   over 12 weeks (t(46) = 2.36, P = 0.02). When patients were stratified by
   remission status, non-remitters demonstrated a significant increase in
   WMHs (t(23) = 2.17, P = 0.04), but this was not observed in remitters
   (t(22) = 1.09, P = 0.29). Other markers of brain integrity were also
   investigated including whole brain gray matter volume, hippocampal
   volume, and fractional anisotropy. No significant differences were
   observed in any of these markers during treatment, including when
   patients were stratified based on remission status. These results add to
   existing literature showing the association between WMH accumulation and
   LLD treatment outcomes. Moreover, this is the first study to demonstrate
   similar findings over a short interval (ie 12 weeks), which corresponds
   to the typical length of an antidepressant trial. These findings serve
   to highlight the acute interplay of cerebrovascular ischemic disease and
   LLD.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the numerical solution of initial value problems
   (IVPs), for systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), by an
   explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (we will refer to it as the
   classical fourth-order method) with special nonlinear stability property
   indicated by the positivity. Stepsize conditions, guaranteeing this
   property based on general theory, have been studied earlier, see e.g.
   Hundsdorfer and Verwer (2003). In this paper we show that general
   obtained result on positivity for classical fourth-order method is
   somewhat too strict. We obtain new results for positivity which are
   important in practical applications. We provide some computational
   experiments to illustrate our results. (C) 2015 Faculty of Engineering,

   Bi1-xLaxFe0.5Sc0.5O3-composition revealed that the samples obtained
   under high-pressure (6 GPa) and high-temperature (1500 K) conditions
   crystalize into a distorted perovskite structure with the orthorhombic
   Pnma symmetry and the unit cell para-meters: a(0) = 5.6745(2) angstrom,
   b(0) = 7.9834(3) angstrom and c(0) = 5.6310(2) angstrom. A long-range
   magnetic ordering takes place below 220 K and implies a G-type magnetic
   structure with the moments 4.10(4)mu(B) per Fe aligned predominately
   along the orthorhombic c-axis. The space group representation theory
   using the orthorhombic symmetry yields four bi-linear coupling schemes
   for the magnetic order parameters imposed by antisymmetric exchange
   interactions. The couplings are analysed based on symmetry adapted
   distortion modes defined in respect of the undistorted cubic perovskite
   structure. The approach allows a quantitative estimation of the coupling
   strength. It is shown that the experimentally found spin configuration
   combines the magnetic order parameters coupled by the atomic
   displacement modes with the largest amplitudes. The results indicate
   that the antisymmetric exchange is the dominant anisotropic term which
   fully controls the direction of the Fe3+ spins in the distorted
   perovskite lattice.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims: Medical treatment options for gastroparesis are
   limited. Data from studies of botulinum toxin and surgical pyloroplasty
   suggest that disruption of the pylorus can result in symptomatic
   improvement in some patients with refractory gastroparetic symptoms. The
   aim of this study was to determine the clinical response to transpyloric
   stent (TPS) placement in patients with gastroparetic symptoms refractory
   to standard therapy.
   Methods: Patients with gastroparesis refractory to medical treatment
   were referred for TPS placement for salvage therapy. Self-reported
   symptom improvement, stent migration rate, and pre- and post-stent
   gastric-emptying study results were collected.
   Results: A total of 30 patients with refractory gastroparesis underwent
   48 TPS procedures. Of these, 25 of 48 (52.1\%) were performed in
   patients admitted to the hospital with intractable gastroparetic
   symptoms. Successful stent placement in the desired location across the
   pylorus (technical success) was achieved during 47 procedures (98\%).
   Most (n = 24) stents were anchored to the gastric wall by using
   endoscopic suturing with a mean number of sutures of 2 (range 1-3) per
   procedure. Clinical response was observed in 75\% of patients, and all
   inpatients were successfully discharged. Clinical success in patients
   with the predominant symptoms of nausea and vomiting was higher than in
   those patients with a predominant symptom of pain (79\% vs 21\%, P =
   .12). A repeat gastric-emptying study was performed in 16 patients, and
   the mean 4-hour gastric emptying normalized in 6 patients and
   significantly improved in 5 patients. Stent migration was least common
   (48\%) when stents were sutured.
   Conclusion: TPS placement is a feasible novel endoscopic treatment
   modality for gastroparesis and improves both symptoms and gastric
   emptying in patients who are refractory to medical treatment, especially
   those with nausea and vomiting. TPS placement may be considered as
   salvage therapy for inpatients with intractable symptoms or potentially
   as a method to select patients who may respond to more permanent
   therapies directed at the pylorus.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a common disease of the central nervous
   system. The interaction between inflammatory and neurodegenerative
   processes typically results in irregular neurological disturbances
   followed by progressive disability. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been
   implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. The DNA polymerase-gamma
   (POLG) gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of enzyme responsible
   for directing mtDNA replication, contains a poly glutamine tract
   (poly-Q) in the N-terminal, encoded by a CAG sequence in exon 2.
   Materials \& Methods
   We analyzed the POLG trinucleotide repeats in 40 Iranian patients with
   MS (27 females and 13 males with an age range of 18-55); and 47 healthy
   age, gender, and ethnic matched controls were chosen by PCR-SSCP
   analysis.
   Results
   Our results indicated that the most common allele in patients had 10
   consecutive CAG repeats (10Q). Other alleles of 11and 12 trinucleotide
   repeats were detected. We did not find any difference between the CAG
   repeat length distribution in controls and MS patients.
   Conclusion
   No correlation was observed in the POLG gene CAG repeat with
   pathogenesis of MS, but it looks that other point mutations in POLG gene
   may have an important role in the disease's pathogenesis and produced
   more significant results.}},

Abstract = {{To assess HIV risk perception and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
   interest among university students, an anonymous survey was conducted
   among students from a large public university in Thailand. There were

   group. Of these 118 participants, 111 (94\%) perceived themselves as no

   risks, rates of consistent condom use with vaginal, oral and anal sex
   were all low (43\%, 18\% and 33\%, respectively). The low rates of
   consistent condom use were significantly associated with false
   perception of low HIV risk (P<0.05). Independent factors associated with
   the false perception were male gender (P<0.001), living with a domestic
   partner (P=0.004), being homosexual or bisexual (P=0.02) and being
   students from a non-medicine faculty (P=0.04). Of the 641 participants,
   211 (33\%) were not interested in PrEP. Consistent condom use with oral
   sex (P=0.004), consistent condom use with vaginal sex (P=0.04) and being
   heterosexual (P=0.02) were independently associated with no PrEP
   interest. Our study suggests the need for enhanced interventions to
   improve HIV risk perception and safe sex practices among the university

Abstract = {{Background: Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis is used to manage end stage
   arthritis, often associated with severe bone loss. The goal is to
   relieve pain through a stable, well-aligned hindfoot and ankle. We
   describe our initial results and outcome of ankle and tibiotalocalcaneal
   arthrodesis using a 908 blade plate.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients managed at
   our institution between 2010 and 2014. Twenty cases were identified who
   had either talocrural (n = 9) or TTC fusion (n = 11) with 1 patient
   having both ankle and then TTC fusion in separate sittings.
   Results: Fusion occurred in 18 of the 20 cases (90\%) with correction of
   angular deformity and restoration of hindfoot alignment. None of the 18
   patients developed complications and all discharged to follow-up when

   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that using a 90 degrees blade plate
   for ankle or TTC arthrodesis in a diverse group of complex primary and
   revision indications associated with severe deformity and bone loss
   resulted in a high rate of bony union and stable deformity correction.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a heading angle observer for
   Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) during dynamic conditions
   in the presence of roll/pitch oscillation and acceleration disturbances.
   Unlike previous algorithms, which focused on deep water working
   environments where the external accelerations and oscillation were
   rather small, this paper proposes a heading observer that deals with the
   effects of near surface working conditions on ROVs, such as waves or
   unexpected water currents. These effects cause significant roll and
   pitch disturbances as well as high-acceleration drift motions, which
   affect the measurements from the incorporated sensor system. To overcome
   this situation, a novel heading observer is proposed, consisting of two
   Kalman filter (KF) steps: one for acceleration elimination and one for
   roll and pitch oscillation compensation. The data from the inertial
   measurement unit and the magnetometer are combined to estimate and
   compensate for external accelerations and roll/pitch disturbances by
   adjusting the covariance values. Free running tests, based on a physical
   ROV model, were conducted under various working environments to verify
   the performance of the proposed observer. The comparison with previous
   algorithms was also made to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithm. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Detection of Epstein-Barr Virus DNA in Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis}},
Journal = {{JUNDISHAPUR JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare histiocytic
   proliferation of unknown etiology. It is characterized by granuloma-like
   proliferation of Langerhans-type dendritic cells and mainly affects
   young children. Although multiple investigators have suggested the
   possible role of viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human
   herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, and
   Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the pathogenesis of LCH, it remains, however,
   debated.
   Objectives: The EBV infection is reported to be associated with LCH.
   Nevertheless, no report could be found about involved Iranian children
   in English medical literature. In this study, we investigated the
   presence of EBV in Iranian children with LCH.
   Patients and Methods: In this retrospective study, in which we
   investigated the prevalence of presence of EBV DNA in LCH, using
   paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 30 patients with LCH and 30 age and
   tissue-matched controls, who were operated for reasons other than
   infectious diseases (between the years 2002 and 2012), by real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, in the department of
   pediatric pathology. No ethical issues arose in the study, because only
   the pathology reports were reviewed, retrospectively, and the patients
   were anonymous.
   Results: There was a significant difference in prevalence of EBV
   presence between patients and controls. The EBV was found by RT-PCR in
   19 (63.33\%) out of 30 patients and only in eight (26.7\%) of 30 control
   samples. The P = 0.004, was calculated using chi-square test (OR: 4.75;
   95\% CI: 1.58. 14.25).
   Conclusions: Our study is the first investigation performed on patients
   with LCH and its possible association with EBV in Iran. Considering the
   P = 0.004, which is statistically significant, the findings do support
   the hypothesis of a possible role for EBV in the pathogenesis of LCH.
   These results are in accordance with several previous investigations,
   with positive findings.}},

   character, Kamala Khan, a Muslim American-Pakistani superheroine of the

   girls as superheroes is framed by a desire to interrupt rampant
   Islamophobia and xenophobia, yet, in order to produce such a disruption
   it relies on, and (re) produces, stereotypical conceptualizations of
   Muslim masculinities as mirrored in men who are conservative, prone to
   irrational rage, pre-modern, anachronistic, and even bestial. However,
   as the series progresses we notice the emergence of representations of
   complex and complicated Muslim masculinities that cast doubt on these
   tired, hackneyed ones, thus making way for a comic to undertake the
   pedagogical work of resistance. We see this graphic novel, like the
   shape-shifting Kamala herself, as wielding potentially dynamic and
   transformative power in social imaginaries.}},

Abstract = {{The adipokines chemerin and adiponectin are reciprocally related in the
   pathogenesis of insulin resistance and inflammation in obesity. Weight
   loss increases adiponectin and reduces chemerin, insulin resistance, and
   inflammation, but the effects of caloric restriction and physical
   activity are difficult to separate in combined lifestyle modification.
   We compared effects of diet- or exercise-induced weight loss on
   chemerin, adiponectin, insulin resistance, and inflammation in obese
   men. Eighty abdominally obese Asian men (body mass index {[}BMI] >= 30
   kg/m(2), waist circumference {[}WC] >= 90 cm, mean age 42.6 years) were
   randomized to reduce daily intake by 500 kilocalories (n = 40) or
   perform moderate -intensity aerobic and resistance exercise (200-300
   min/week) (n = 40) to increase energy expenditure by a similar amount
   for 24 weeks. The diet and exercise groups had similar decreases in
   energy deficit (-456 +/- 338 vs. 455 +/- 315 kcal/day), weight (-3.6 +/-
   3.4 vs. -3.3 +/- 4.6 kg), and WC (-3.4 +/- 4.4 vs. -3.6 +/- 3.2 cm). The
   exercise group demonstrated greater reductions in fat mass (-3.9 +/- 3.5
   vs. 2.7 +/- 5.3 kg), serum chemerin (-9.7 +/- 11.1 vs. 4.3 +/- 12.4
   ng/ml), the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
   (-2.11 +/- 3.13 vs. 1.49 +/- 3.08 mg/L), and insulin resistance as
   measured by homeostatic model assessment (-2.45 +/- 1.88 vs. 1.38 +/-
   3.77). Serum adiponectin increased only in the exercise group.
   Exercise-induced fat mass loss was more effective than dieting for
   improving adipokine profile, insulin resistance, and systemic
   inflammation in obese men, underscoring metabolic benefits of increased
   physical activity.}},

Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{459-471}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates sewage sludge disposal methods with particular
   emphasis on combustion as the priority disposal method. Sewage sludge
   incineration is an attractive option because it minimizes odour,
   significantly reduces the volume of the starting material and thermally
   destroys organic and toxic components of the off pads. Additionally, it
   is possible that ashes could be used. Currently, as many as 11 plants
   use sewage sludge as fuel in Poland; thus, this technology must be
   further developed in Poland while considering the benefits of
   co-combustion with other fuels.
   This paper presents the results of experimental studies aimed at
   determining the mechanisms (defining the fuel combustion region by
   studying the effects of process parameters, including the size of the
   fuel sample, temperature in the combustion chamber and air velocity, on
   combustion) and kinetics (measurement of fuel temperature and mass
   changes) of fuel combustion in an air stream under different thermal
   conditions and flow rates. The combustion of the sludge samples during
   air flow between temperatures of 800 and 900 degrees C is a kinetic
   diffusion process. This process determines the sample size, temperature
   of its environment, and air velocity. The adopted process parameters,
   the time and ignition temperature of the fuel by volatiles, combustion
   time of the volatiles, time to reach the maximum temperature of the fuel
   surface, maximum temperature of the fuel surface, char combustion time,
   and the total process time, had significant impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We retrospectively evaluated single-institute outcomes of allogeneic
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) with a
   reduced-intensity conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine (125
   mg/m(2)) and melphalan (140 mg/m(2)) for multiple myeloma. Twenty-three
   patients (median age: 46 years) were evaluated. Stem cell sources were
   bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells from siblings (n = 4) and
   bone marrow from unrelated donors (n = 19). For graft-versus-host
   disease prophylaxis, cyclosporine A or tacrolimus with short-term
   methotrexate was given. Disease status at time of transplant was
   complete response in four patients, very good partial or partial
   response in 13, and stable or progressive disease in six. The median
   follow-up period of 7 survivors at analysis was 73.2 months (range
   46.0-158.9 months). During the follow-up, disease recurrence or
   progression was observed in 21 patients, and was primary causes of death
   in 88 \% of the patients. The 5-year overall survival and
   progression-free survival rates were 38.6 \% (95 \% CI 19.3-57.7 \%) and
   5.4 \% (95 \% CI 0.4-21.6 \%), respectively. Although allo-HSCT with
   this conditioning could be safely performed, further refinement of this
   approach aiming at more effective eradication of myeloma cells is
   clearly warranted.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the rotational harmonic source of the runout in a
   2.5aEuro(3) hard disk drive (HDD) with a height of 5 mm, especially at
   low rotating speeds. After disassembling the HDD, circumferential
   scratches between the upper thrust surface of the hub and sleeve were
   observed. Through a finite element static analysis of the hub, the
   deflection resulting from disc clamping force was identified as a source
   of mechanical contact between the rotating hub and the stationary
   sleeve. This was determined to generate large-amplitude harmonics in the
   runout and flying height lower than design values. To prevent mechanical
   contact between these components, we propose a robust hub design in
   which the hub thickness radially decreases between the inner and outer
   thrusts. And HDD spindle motor was prototyped with the proposed hub.
   Experiments showed that the flying height is increased almost same as
   design value and the harmonics of the runout were significantly reduced,
   even at low rotating speeds. After disassembling the prototyped HDD
   spindle motor, we confirmed that there were no scratches on the surface
   of the thrust bearing.}},

Abstract = {{Forkhead transcription factor family O (FoxO) maintains adult stem cell
   reserves by supporting their long-term proliferative potential.
   MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate neuronal stem/progenitor cell (NSPC)
   proliferation and differentiation during neural development by
   controlling the expression of a specific set of target genes. In the
   neurogenic subventricular zone, FoxO1 is specifically expressed in NSPCs
   and is no longer detected during the transition to neuroblast stage,
   forming an inverse correlation with miR-9 expression. The
   3'-untranslated region of FoxO1 contains a conserved target sequence of
   miR-9 and FoxO1 expression is coordinated in concert with miR-9 during
   neuronal differentiation. Our study demonstrates that FoxO1 contributes
   to NSPC fate decision through its cooperation with the Notch signaling
   pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Azetidine derivatives are of interest for drug development because they
   may be useful therapeutic agents. However, their mechanisms of action
   remain to be completely elucidated. Here, we have investigated the
   effects of 3-(naphthalen-2-yl(propoxy)methyl)azetidine hydrochloride
   (KHG26792) on ATP-induced activation of NFAT and MAPK through P2X7
   receptor in the BV-2 mouse microglial cell line. KHG26792 decreased
   ATP-induced TNF-alpha release from BV-2 microglia by suppressing, at
   least partly, P2X7 receptor stimulation. KHG26792 also inhibited the
   ATP-induced increase in IL-6, PGE2, NO, ROS, CXCL2, and CCL3. ATP
   induced NFAT activation through P2X7 receptor, with KHG26792 reducing
   the ATP-induced NFAT activation. KHG26792 inhibited an ATP-induced
   increase in iNOS protein and ERK phosphorylation. KHG26792 prevented an
   ATP-induced increase in MMP-9 activity through the P2X7 receptor as a
   result of degradation of TIMP-1 by cathepsin B. Our data provide
   mechanistic insights into the role of KHG26792 in the inhibition of
   TNF-alpha produced via P2X7 receptor-mediated activation of NFAT and
   MAPK pathways in ATP-treated BV-2 cells. This study highlights the
   potential use of KHG26792 as a therapeutic agent for the many diseases
   of the CNS related to activated microglia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Mold has been implicated in the development of atopic dermatitis (AD);
   however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The aim of the study
   was to investigate the effects of mold exposure in early life through
   epidemiologic and mechanistic studies in vivo and in vitro.
   Exposure to visible mold inside the home during the first year of life
   was associated with an increased risk for current AD by two
   population-based cross-sectional human studies. Children with the AG +
   GG genotype of GSTP1 showed increased risk for current AD when exposed
   to mold. In the mouse model, treatment with patulin induced and
   aggravated clinically significant AD and Th2-related inflammation of the
   affected mouse skin. Additionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were
   released in the mouse skin as well by human keratinocytes. In
   conclusions, mold exposure increases the risk for AD related to ROS
   generation mediated by Th2-promoting inflammatory cytokines. (C) 2015

Title = {{Physicochemical and optical properties of combustion-generated particles
   from a coal-fired power plant, automobiles, ship engines, and charcoal
   kilns}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Abstract = {{The physicochemical and optical properties of combustion-generated
   particles from various sources were investigated. Coal-fired power
   plants, charcoal kilns, automobiles, and ship engines were the major
   sources, representing combustions of coal, biomass, and two different
   types of diesel, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) equipped with both SEM and
   HRTEM were used for physicochemical analysis. Light-absorbing properties
   were assessed using a spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere.
   Particles generated from different combustion sources and conditions
   demonstrate great variability in their morphology, structure, and
   composition. From coal-fired power plants, both fly ash and flue gas
   were mostly composed of heterogeneously mixed mineral ash spheres,
   suggesting that complete combustion released carbonaceous species at
   high temperatures (1200-1300 degrees C). Both automobile and ship
   exhaust from diesel combustion show the typical features of soot:
   concentric circles comprising closely packed graphene layers. However,
   heavy fuel oil (HFO)-combusted particles from ship exhaust demonstrate
   more complex compositions containing a different morphology of particles
   than soot; for example, spherically shaped char particles composed of
   minerals and carbon. Regarding soot aggregates, particles from HFO
   combustion have different chemical compositions; carbon dominates but Ca
   (29.8\%), S (28.7\%), Na (1\%), and Mg (1\%) are also present, which
   were not found in particles from automobile emission. This indicates
   that fuel properties and combustion conditions are important in
   determining the fate of particles. Finally, from biomass combustion,
   amorphous and droplet-like carbonaceous particles with no crystalline
   structure were observed, and are generally formed by the condensation of
   low-volatile species at low-temperature (similar to 300-800 degrees C)
   combustion conditions. Significant differences in optical properties
   depending on the combustion source were observed. Diesel combustion
   particles from automobile and ship showed wavelength-independent
   absorbing properties, whereas the particles from coal and charcoal kiln
   combustion showed enhanced absorption at shorter wavelengths, which is a
   characteristic of brown carbon. Main light absorbers at short
   wavelengths are proposed for organics and minerals (e.g., iron oxide)
   for biomass and coal combustion, respectively. Our findings suggest that
   source-dependent properties and distributions across the globe should be
   considered when their impacts on climate change and air qualities are
   discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Somatic heterozygous mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) are
   abundantly found in several types of cancer and strongly implicate
   altered metabolism in carcinogenesis. In the present study, we have
   identified alpha-mangostin as a novel selective inhibitor of mutant IDH1
   (IDH1-R132H). We have observed that alpha-mangostin competitively
   inhibits the binding of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) to IDH1-R132H.
   The structure-relationship study reveals that alpha-mangostin exhibits
   the strongest core inhibitor structure. Finally, we have observed that
   alpha-mangostin selectively promotes demethylation of 5-methylcytosine
   (5mC) and histone H3 trimethylated lysine residues in IDH1 (+/R132H)
   MCF10A cells, presumably via restoring the activity of cellular
   alpha-KG-dependent DNA hydroxylases and histone H3 lysine demethylases.
   Collectively, we provide evidence that alpha-mangostin selectively
   inhibits IDH1-R132H. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Developing Magnetoencephalography (MEG) based on Superconducting Quantum
   Interference Device (SQUID) facilitates to observe the human brain
   functions in non-invasively and high temporal and high spatial
   resolution. By using this MEG, we studied alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz) that is
   one of the most predominant spontaneous rhythm in human brain. The 8-13
   Hz rhythm is observed in several sensory region in the brain. In visual
   related region of occipital, we call to alpha rhythm, and auditory
   related region of temporal call to tau rhythm, sensorimotor related
   region of parietal call to mu rhythm. These rhythms are decreased in
   task related region and increased in task irrelevant regions. This means
   that these rhythms play a pivotal role of inhibition in task irrelevant
   region. It may be helpful to attention to the task. In several
   literature about the alpha-band inhibition in multi-sensory modality
   experiment, they observed this effect in the occipital and somatosensory
   region. In this study, we hypothesized that we can also observe the
   alpha-band inhibition in the auditory cortex, mediated by the tau
   rhythm. Before that, we first investigated the existence of the alpha
   and tau rhythm in occipital and temporal region, respectively. To see
   these rhythms, we applied the visual and auditory stimulation, in turns,
   suppressed in task relevant regions, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The potential benefits of tradable pollution permits and allowances can
   be limited by transaction costs. The implementation and operation of the
   European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) involves transaction

   efficiency and price discovery in the EU ETS. An empirical assessment of
   nonlinear mean reversion is provided using threshold cointegration,
   which allows for asymmetric regime-dependent adjustment to the
   equilibrium relationship between European Union Emission Allowances
   (EUA) spot and futures prices. The mean reversion process reveals
   nonlinear and regime-dependent adjustment, and thus the empirical
   evidence indicates that transaction costs affect the mean reversion

Abstract = {{Brazilin isolated from Caesalpinia sappan has long been known as a
   natural red pigment Our study evaluated the inhibitory effect of
   brazilin on osteoclast differentiation and investigated its mechanism of
   action. Our results demonstrated that brazilin inhibited receptor
   activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-mediated osteoclast
   differentiation in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, without
   any evidence of cytotoxicity. The mRNA expression of tartrate-resistant
   acid phosphatase (TRAP), nuclear factor of activated T-cells,
   cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and
   cathepsin K in RANKL-treated RAW264.7 cells was inhibited by brazilin
   treatment. Brazilin also decreased RANKL-induced expression of
   inflammatory mediator genes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase,
   iNOS; cydooxygenase (COX)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and
   interleukin (IL)-6 and inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinases
   (ERK) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell
   (NF-kappa B) p65 phosphorylation in RANKL-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. A
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced osteoporosis study was also performed
   to assess the effects of brazilin in vivo. Micro-computed tomography
   (CT) analysis of the femurs showed that LPS treatment causes bone loss
   in mice, but it was significantly attenuated after co-treatment with
   brazilin (100 mg/kg). Therefore, brazilin may have therapeutic potential
   in preventing bone loss. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A correction methodology for distortions induced by ionospheric
   scintillation on fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
   is proposed. The correction is based on deriving the phase distortion
   induced by the ionosphere from Faraday rotation estimates. The estimated
   phase distortion is then used for correction. In order to compensate the
   phase and time-Doppler history distortions, the correction has to be
   performed at the slant range of the ionospheric layer, i.e., on
   partially focused single-look complex data. Accordingly, the performance
   of the proposed correction methodology depends, among other factors, on
   knowledge of the altitude of the effective ionospheric layer (assuming
   the thin ionospheric layer model). Its estimation from the SAR data
   itself is therefore also addressed. The methodology was applied and
   validated on simulated P-band data for various ionospheric conditions
   and on real L-band data acquired by the Advanced Land Observation
   Satellite Phased Array L-band SAR (PALSAR).}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness
   of collagenated biphasic calcium phosphate (CBCP) as a carrier for bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) at the early stage of healing in rabbit
   sinus.
   Material and Methods: In 16 rabbits, BMP-2-loaded CBCP was grafted into
   one sinus (the BMP group) and saline-soaked CBCP was grafted into
   another sinus (the CTL group). The groups were assigned randomly. After
   2 weeks (n = 8) or 4 weeks (n = 8), radiographic and histological
   analysis was performed.
   Results: Total augmented volume was significantly larger in the BMP
   group at both healing periods. Furthermore, new bone volume was
   significantly greater in the BMP group at 4 weeks. Marked bone formation
   near the schneiderian membrane was found in the BMP groups at the early
   healing period. At 4 weeks, evenly distributed new bone was observed in
   the BMP group, whereas the new bone was sparsely distributed in the
   central portion in the CTL group.
   Conclusion: It can be concluded that the addition of BMP-2 to CBCP
   resulted in a greater initial augmented volume as a result of
   postoperative swelling, which is replaced by early bone formation, and
   it was prominent near the Schneiderian membrane.}},

Abstract = {{In 2012, D. Schroder and H. Schroder introduced verifiable data
   streaming (VDS) that enables a client to append, search, verify, and
   update the streamed data efficiently. After storing the data with a
   server, a client issues a query to receive a proof that the data of the
   client are still correctly stored. Anyone can check the validity of the
   proof publicly in VDS. However, the length of a secret of a client, the
   length of a proof, and the complexity of appending an element in the
   previous VDS schemes are O(log n), where n is the upper bound on the
   number of elements to be stored. In this paper, we suggest a more
   efficient VDS scheme. In our scheme, the length of a secret of a client
   is only O(1), and the length of a proof and the complexity of appending
   an element are O(log i), where i(<= n) is the index of an element. We
   also show that our scheme is secure under any collision-resistant hash
   functions and unforgeable signature schemes without random oracles.

Abstract = {{Originally, activins were identified as stimulators of FSH release in
   reproduction. Other activities, including secondary axis formation in
   development, have since been revealed. Here, we investigated the
   influence of activin beta(A) on the body, including the
   gastro-intestinal (GI) tract.
   Initially, the activin beta(A) protein was detected in the serum
   proportional to the amount of pCMV-rAct plasmid injected. The induced
   level of activin beta(A) in muscle was higher in female than male mice.
   Subsequent results revealed that stomach and intestine were severely
   damaged in pCMV-rAct-injected mice. At the cellular level, loss of
   parietal cells was observed, resulting in increased pH within the
   stomach. This phenomenon was more severe in male than female mice.
   Consistent with damage of the stomach and intestine, activin beta(A)
   often led to necrosis in the tip of the tail or foot, and loss of body
   weight was observed in pCMV-rAct-injected male but not female mice.
   Finally, in pCMV-rAct-injected mice, circulating activin beta(A) led to
   death at supraphysiological doses, and this was dependent on the strain
   of mice used.
   Taken together, these results indicate that activin beta(A) has an
   important role outside of reproduction and development, specifically in
   digestion. These data also indicate that activin beta(A) must be
   controlled within a narrow range because of latent lethal activity. In
   addition, our approach can be used effectively for functional analysis
   of secreted proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Despite sexual function making an important
   contribution to the quality of life, data on erectile function are
   relatively scant in patients with chronic liver disease. We evaluated
   the prevalence of and risk factors for erectile dysfunction (ED) in
   patients with liver disease related to hepatitis B, especially among
   those with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) or early-stage cirrhosis.
   Methods: In total, 69 patients (35 with CHB and 34 with
   hepatitis-B-related liver cirrhosis {[}HBV-LC]) aged 40-59 years were
   analyzed. Child-Pugh classes of A and B were present in 30 (88.2\%) and
   4 (11.8\%) of the patients with HBV-LC, respectively. The erectile
   function of the patients was evaluated using the Korean version of
   IIEF-5.
   Results: The prevalence of any ED was 24.6\% for all patients, and 8.6\%
   and 41.2\% for those with CHB and HBV-LC, respectively (P=0.002). While
   there was only one (2.9\%) CHB patient for each stage of ED, mild,
   moderate, and severe ED stages were seen in three (8.8\%), one (2.9\%),
   and ten (29.4\%) of the HBV-LC patients, respectively. Multiple
   regression analysis identified the type of liver disease (P=0.010),
   hypertension (P=0.022), score on the Beck Depression Inventory (P
   =0.044), and the serum albumin level (P=0.014) as significant
   independent factors for the presence of ED.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of ED was significantly higher in patients
   with early-stage HBV-LC than in those with CHB. Therefore, screening
   male patients with early viral cirrhosis for ED and providing
   appropriate support are needed, especially when the cirrhosis is
   accompanied by hypertension, depression, or a depressed level of serum
   albumin.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the antibacterial effect of 405 +/- 5 nm light
   emitting diode (LED) on Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and
   Staphylococcus aureus, and examined its antibacterial mechanism by
   determining the bacterial membrane and DNA damages. A 405 +/- 5 nm LED
   illuminated the Gram-positive pathogens until 486 J/cm(2) at 4 degrees
   C. Weibull model was used to calculate reliable life (t(R)) to compare
   bacterial sensitivities to LED illumination. The membrane damage was
   determined by NaCl and LIVE/DEAD (R) assay, while comet assay and DNA
   ladder analysis were conducted to determine DNA degradation. The
   illumination resulted in 1.9, 2.1, and 1.0 log reductions for B. cereus,
   L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus at 486 J/cm(2), respectively. The
   comparison of tit values revealed that L. monocytogenes was identified
   as the most susceptible strain to LED illumination. The percentage of
   the bacterial sensitivity to NaCl remarkably increased in
   LED-illuminated cells compared to non-illuminated cells. Moreover, loss
   of membrane integrity was confirmed for LED-illuminated cells by
   LIVE/DEAD (R) assay, whereas no DNA breakage was indicated by comet
   assay and DNA ladder analysis. Thus, these findings suggest that the
   antibacterial effect of 405 +/- 5 nm LED illumination on these pathogens
   might be due to physical damage to bacterial membrane rather than DNA
   degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{{[}Purpose] This study was conducted to determine the difference in foot
   pressures between flat and normal feet at different gait speeds on an
   ascending slope. {[}Subjects] This study enrolled 30 adults with normal
   (n=15) and flat feet (n=15), with ages from 21 to 30 years old, who had
   no history of neurological disorders or gait problems. A treadmill was
   used for the analysis of kinematic features during gait, using a slope
   of 10\%, and gait velocities of slow, normal, and fast. {[}Methods] A
   foot pressure analyzer was used to measure changes in foot pressure.
   {[}Results] Compared to the normal subjects, the foot pressure of the
   flatfoot subjects showed a significant increase in the 2-3rd metatarsal
   region with increasing gait speed, whereas there were significant
   decreases in the 1st toe and 1st metatarsal regions with increasing gait
   speed. {[}Conclusion] The body weight of adults with flatfoot was
   concentrated on the 2-3rd metatarsal region during the stance phase and
   increased with walking speed on the ascending slope due to weakening of
   function of the medial longitudinal arch.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a flat-panel detector based on an organic semiconductor
   was investigated as a candidate for an X-ray imaging detector. The
   characteristics of the detector was examined via indirect X-ray
   detection method, in which the incident X-ray needed to charge
   conversion is achieved by the co-operation of a scintillator and active
   layer in the detector. Detectors were fabricated using a blend of the
   conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the fullerene
   derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as a thin-film
   active layer. In order to enhance the carrier generation efficiency in
   the active layer, the optimal process condition when varying the
   P3HT:PCBM blending ratio and spin rate was investigated. The detector
   fabricated at the condition of P3HT:PCBM = 1:1 blending ratio and
   700-rpm spin rate showed the highest collected charge density, lowest

Abstract = {{The lipophilic compounds in nine vegetables consumed in Korea were
   characterized for diversity in phytochemical content. We also analyzed
   the relationships among these compounds in terms of their contents. The
   profiles of 18 lipophilic compounds in the leaves were subjected to
   data-mining processes, including principal component analysis (PCA),
   Pearson's correlation analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA),
   and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). These species
   could be distinguished by means of the PCA results. HCA of these
   phytochemicals resulted in clusters derived from closely related
   biochemical pathways. PLS-DA showed significant separation among
   extracts from the following four families: Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae,
   Brassicaceae, and Malvaceae. The major metabolites that facilitated
   differentiation in the PLS-DA model were campesterol, beta-sitosterol,
   beta-amyrin, stigmasterol, cholesterol, octacosanol (c28), alpha-amyrin,
   and hexacosanol (c26). Chard contained high levels of triacontanol
   (c30), which was positively correlated with the c28 content (r = 0.746,
   p < 0.0001). Stigmasterol, alpha-amyrin, and beta-amyrin contents were
   higher in Asteraceae species including chicon, lettuce, and oak than
   other plant families. These results demonstrate the utility of metabolic
   profiling, combined with multivariate analysis, for discrimination of
   vegetable species as well as evaluation of food quality.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Pediatric chest pain is considered to be idiopathic or caused
   by benign diseases. This study was to find out how much upper
   gastrointestinal (UGI) diseases are major causes of chest pain in
   pediatric patients.
   Methods: The records of 75 children (42 boys and 33 girls, aged 3-17
   years old) who have presented with mainly chest pain from January 1995
   to March 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Chest X-ray and
   electrocardiography (ECG) were performed in all aptients. Further
   cardiologic and gastrointestinal (GI) evaluations were performed in
   indicated patients.
   Results: Chest pain was most common in the children of 6 and 9 to 14
   years old. Esopha-gogastric diseases were unexpectedly the most common
   direct causes of the chest pain, the next are idiopathic, cardiac
   diseases, chest trauma, respiratory disease, and psychosomatic disease.
   Even though 21 showed abnormal ECG findings and 7 showed abnormalities
   on echocardiography, cardiac diseases were determined to be the direct
   causes only in 9. UGI endoscopy was performed in 57 cases, and
   esophago-gastric diseases which thereafter were thought to be causative
   diseases were 48 cases. The mean age of the children with
   esophago-gastric diseases were different with marginal significance from
   that of the other children with chest pain not related with
   esophago-gastric diseases. All the 48 children diagnosed with treated
   with GI medicines based on the diagnosis, and 37 cases (77.1\%)
   subsequently showed clinical improvement.
   Conclusion: Diagnostic approaches to find out esophageal and gastric
   diseases in children with chest pain are important as well as cardiac
   and respiratory investigations.}},

Abstract = {{During the past two decades, performance management programs in Korea's
   healthcare sector have become increasingly diversified in terms of the
   measures used and the scope of the healthcare services measured. Despite
   the recent growth of peiformance management programs in Korea's
   healthcare system, few studies have evaluated performance management
   programs as a whole in the context of national healthcare system
   objectives. Drawing on Talbot's performance regime framework, this study
   describes the major challenges to Korea's performance-based healthcare
   management systems. We suggest that the challenges can be addressed by
   creating a coherent conceptual framework and a macro-level coordination
   body. We further suggest that relevant performance interventions be
   chosen based on theoretical models of performance management. Our
   findings have implications for future studies on performance management
   of healthcare systems in other countries as well as in Korea.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the impact of climate change on pastoral livestock
   in Boulgou Province located in the sub-humid zone of Burkina Faso. We
   analysed the annual rainfall and temperature data from 1980 to 2012
   using both Mann-Kendall's statistical test to show the long-term annual
   trends and Standardised Anomaly Index (SAI) to evaluate inter-annual
   rainfall fluctuations. We also conducted household interviews with 248
   respondents to analyse agro-pastoralists' perceptions of climate change
   and variability, its impacts on livestock production and their
   acceptance of adaptation measures. A binary regression model was
   employed to identify the most important factors affecting
   agro-pastoralists' decisions to adopt specific adaptation measures.
   Within the period of study, the annual rainfall showed an upward trend,
   with high inter-annual variability and 818.9 mm of mean annual rainfall.
   Additionally, the annual minimum and maximum temperatures showed a
   statistically significant upward trend, with a rate of change of 0.20
   degrees C and 0.27 degrees C per decade. The results of the household
   interviews indicated that most of the respondents (73.4 \%) observed
   temperature changes compared with rainfall amount (1.2 \%). To adapt to
   these changes, they have already adopted some adaptation measures that
   include the use of crop residue and herd destocking. Other less popular
   but innovative adaptation measures such as haymaking and use of
   concentrate livestock feeds could be promoted effectively under a
   comprehensive climate change adaptation action plan within a reviewed
   National Policy for Sustainable Livestock Development. This case study
   is one of the platforms through which poor agro-pastoralists' perception
   and recommendations can be accommodated in this proposed
   multi-stakeholder policy review.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This multicenter, parallel group study was designed to
   determine if a single administration of <= 15 mL of pharmaceutical-grade
   polidocanol endovenous microfoam (PEM, now approved in the United States
   as Varithena {[}polidocanol injectable foam], BTG International Ltd.)
   could alleviate symptoms and improve appearance of varicose veins in a
   typical population of patients with moderate to very severe symptoms of
   superficial venous incompetence and visible varicosities of the great
   saphenous vein (GSV) system.
   Methods: The primary endpoint was patient-reported venous symptom
   improvement measured by change from baseline to Week 8 in 7-day average
   VVSymQ score. Co-secondary endpoints measured improvement in appearance
   of visible varicose veins from baseline to Week 8, as measured by the
   Independent Photography Review Visible Varicose Veins (IPR-V-3) and
   Patient Self-assessment of Visible Varicose Veins (PA-V-3) scores.
   Patients were randomized to five groups: PEM 0.125\% (control), 0.5\%,
   1\%, 2\%, or placebo. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded at each study
   visit. Tertiary endpoints measured duplex ultrasound response, changes
   in venous clinical severity score, and the modified Venous Insufficiency
   Epidemiological and Economic Study Quality of Life/Symptoms.
   Results: At Week 8, VVSymQ scores for the pooled PEM group (0.5\% + 1\%
   + 2\%; p < .0001) and individual dose concentrations (p < .001) were
   significantly superior to placebo. Mean changes from baseline to Week 8
   in IPRV3 and PA-V-3 scores were significantly greater for pooled PEM
   than for placebo (p < .0001). Most AEs were mild and resolved without
   sequelae. No pulmonary emboli were reported.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a single administration of up
   to 15 mL of PEM is a safe, effective, and convenient treatment for the
   symptoms of superficial venous incompetence and the appearance of
   visible varicosities of the GSV system. Doses of 0.5\%, 1\%, and 2\% PEM
   appear to have an acceptable risk-benefit ratio. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model

   MSSM CP violation can already occur at tree level in the Higgs sector.
   We investigate the range of possible allowed CP-violating phases by
   taking into account the constraints arising from the measurements of the
   Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs) and the latest LHC Higgs data. Our
   analysis shows that large CP-violating phases, that are NMSSM-specific,
   are not in conflict with the EDMs. They are dominantly constrained by
   the Higgs data in this case. We use our results to investigate the
   prospects of measuring CP violation through the combined measurement of
   Higgs rates, on the one hand, and in observables based on CP-violating
   Higgs couplings to tau leptons on the other hand. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Title = {{World Health Organization Estimates of the Global and Regional Disease
   Burden of 22 Foodborne Bacterial, Protozoal, and Viral Diseases, 2010: A
   Data Synthesis}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Foodborne diseases are important worldwide, resulting in considerable
   morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, we present the first global
   and regional estimates of the disease burden of the most important
   foodborne bacterial, protozoal, and viral diseases.
   Methods and Findings
   We synthesized data on the number of foodborne illnesses, sequelae,
   deaths, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), for all diseases
   with sufficient data to support global and regional estimates, by age
   and region. The data sources included varied by pathogen and included
   systematic reviews, cohort studies, surveillance studies and other
   burden of disease assessments. We sought relevant data circa 2010, and
   included sources from 1990-2012. The number of studies per pathogen
   ranged from as few as 5 studies for bacterial intoxications through to
   494 studies for diarrheal pathogens. To estimate mortality for
   Mycobacterium bovis infections and morbidity and mortality for invasive
   non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica infections, we excluded cases
   attributed to HIV infection. We excluded stillbirths in our estimates.
   We estimate that the 22 diseases included in our study resulted in two
   billion (95\% uncertainty interval {[}UI] 1.5-2.9 billion) cases, over
   one million (95\% UI 0.89-1.4 million) deaths, and 78.7 million (95\% UI
   65.0-97.7 million) DALYs in 2010. To estimate the burden due to
   contaminated food, we then applied proportions of infections that were
   estimated to be foodborne from a global expert elicitation. Waterborne
   transmission of disease was not included. We estimate that 29\% (95\% UI
   23-36\%) of cases caused by diseases in our study, or 582 million (95\%
   UI 401-922 million), were transmitted by contaminated food, resulting in
   25.2 million (95\% UI 17.5-37.0 million) DALYs. Norovirus was the
   leading cause of foodborne illness causing 125 million (95\% UI 70-251
   million) cases, while Campylobacter spp. caused 96 million (95\% UI
   52-177 million) foodborne illnesses. Of all foodborne diseases,
   diarrheal and invasive infections due to non-typhoidal S. enterica
   infections resulted in the highest burden, causing 4.07 million (95\% UI
   2.49-6.27 million) DALYs. Regionally, DALYs per 100,000 population were
   highest in the African region followed by the South East Asian region.
   Considerable burden of foodborne disease is borne by children less than
   five years of age. Major limitations of our study include data gaps,
   particularly in middle-and high-mortality countries, and uncertainty
   around the proportion of diseases that were foodborne.
   Conclusions
   Foodborne diseases result in a large disease burden, particularly in
   children. Although it is known that diarrheal diseases are a major
   burden in children, we have demonstrated for the first time the
   importance of contaminated food as a cause. There is a need to focus
   food safety interventions on preventing foodborne diseases, particularly
   in low-and middle-income settings.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{48-60}},

Abstract = {{Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) is a low cycle fatigue process in which
   material life is correlated to the mechanical strain amplitude. However,
   it is well known that several other factors influence this life. This
   paper examines several of these parameters and their influence on life
   using experiments conducted on a second generation
   directionally-solidified (DS) Ni-base superalloy. The parameters
   considered include the influence of the temperature extremums (T-max of
   either 750 or 950 degrees C and T-min, of either 100 or 500 degrees C),
   strain ratio (R-e), the strain-temperature phasing (in-phase (IP) and
   out-of-phase (OP)), the influence of dwells at the high temperature end
   of the cycle resulting in a creep-fatigue (CF) interaction, and material
   anisotropy associated with the grain growth direction (longitudinal
   versus transverse). Results suggest that the phasing has a primary role
   in controlling the mechanism of degradation. IP TMF is dominated by
   crack formation in volumes surrounding debonded carbides for both
   continuously cycling (CC) and CF at 950 and 750 degrees C, while OP TMF
   is dominated by surface oxidation and repetitive cracking of the oxide
   that reforms at the crack tip at 950 degrees C. Decreasing the T-max to
   750 degrees C the environmental and creep effects are reduced resulting
   in virtually pure fatigue exposure under OP conditions. With decreasing
   T-min from 500 degrees C to 100 degrees C was observed an increase in
   inelastic strain amplitude and corresponding decrease in life.
   Variations in R-epsilon were found to have no significant influence on
   life or stabilized stress behavior. TMF loading in the transverse
   orientation resulted in life reductions over the longitudinal
   orientation due to cracks propagating in a transgranular manner. Lastly,
   only in material exposed to CF with a T-max of 950 degrees C rafting of
   the gamma' precipitates was observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{290}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2075-2088}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The type III secretion system (T3SS) is an extracellular apparatus used
   by many Gram-negative bacteria to deliver effector proteins directly
   into plant and animal cells, thereby facilitating host-specific
   association. Strains of the enterobacterial genus, Pantoea, have been
   isolated from a wide variety of hosts, including plants, insects, and
   humans, yet it is unclear whether the T3SS may be involved in these
   associations. In this study, we use comparative genomics and
   phylogenetic methods to examine the origin and distribution of T3SSs in
   35 sequenced environmental and clinical strains of Pantoea. We began our
   analysis by examining the distribution of the previously characterized
   plant cell-specific PSI-1 and animal cell-specific PSI-2 of the plant
   pathogenic Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii DC283 (PstDC283), and
   showed that both had a somewhat limited distribution. Our analysis,
   however, identified two variants of a unique plant cell-specific T3SS
   (PSI-1a and PSI-1b) in six Pantoea strains, including a clinical
   isolate. Our genome analysis of PstDC283 also identified a third T3SS
   that we named PSI-3, which has a similar genetic content and
   organization to the Salmonella, animal cell-specific SPI-2 system.
   Phylogenetic analysis of all three systems suggests that the PSI-1
   system has been inherited vertically, whereas the newly identified
   PSI-1a and PSI-1b systems have been acquired independently from other
   genera within the Enterobacteriaceae. PSI-2 appears to have been
   acquired horizontally as far back as the Erwinia/Pantoea common
   ancestor, with evidence of more recent horizontal acquisition of the
   PSI-3 system. Our results suggest that Pantoea is a relatively old plant
   pathogen that has lost and subsequently regained different
   plant-associated T3SSs. This work has broad implications for
   understanding the host-associating capacity of Pantoea strains, and
   reveals the propensity for Pantoea isolates to exchange pathogenicity
   determinants with human-pathogenic members of the Enterobacteriaceae.}},

Abstract = {{This article develops and analyzes patient register-based measures of
   quality for the major Nordic countries. Previous studies show that
   Finnish hospitals have significantly higher average productivity than
   hospitals in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway and also a substantial
   variation within each country. This paper examines whether quality
   differences can form part of the explanation and attempts to uncover
   quality-cost trade-offs. Data on costs and discharges in each
   diagnosis-related group for 160 acute hospitals in 2008-2009 were
   collected. Patient register-based measures of quality such as
   readmissions, mortality (in hospital or outside), and patient safety
   indices were developed and case-mix adjusted. Productivity is estimated
   using bootstrapped data envelopment analysis. Results indicate that
   case-mix adjustment is important, and there are significant differences
   in the case-mix adjusted performance measures as well as in productivity
   both at the national and hospital levels. For most quality indicators,
   the performance measures reveal room for improvement. There is a weak
   but statistical significant trade-off between productivity and inpatient
   readmissions within 30days but a tendency that hospitals with high
   30-day mortality also have higher costs. Hence, no clear cost-quality
   trade-off pattern was discovered. Patient registers can be used and
   developed to improve future quality and cost comparisons. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{There is great interest in wide-bandgap semiconductor devices and most
   recently in vertical GaN structures for power electronic applications
   such as power supplies, solar inverters and motor drives. In this paper
   the temperature-dependent electrical behavior of vertical GaN p-n diodes
   and vertical junction field-effect transistors fabricated on bulk GaN
   substrates of low defect density (10(4) to 10(6) cm(-2)) is described.
   Homoepitaxial MOCVD growth of GaN on its native substrate and the
   ability to control the doping in the drift layers in GaN have allowed
   the realization of vertical device architectures with drift layer
   thicknesses of 6 to 40 mu m and net carrier electron concentrations as
   low as 1 x 10(15) cm(-3). This parameter range is suitable for
   applications requiring breakdown voltages of 1.2 kV to 5 kV. Mg, which
   is used as a p-type dopant in GaN, is a relatively deep acceptor (E-A
   approximate to 0.18 eV) and susceptible to freeze-out at temperatures
   below 200 K. The loss of holes in p-GaN has a deleterious effect on p-n
   junction behavior, p-GaN contacts and channel control in junction
   field-effect transistors at temperatures below 200 K. Impact
   ionization-based avalanche breakdown (BV > 1200 V) in GaN p-n junctions
   is characterized between 77 K and 423 K for the first time. At higher
   temperatures the p-n junction breakdown voltage improves due to
   increased phonon scattering. A positive temperature coefficient in the
   breakdown voltage is demonstrated down to 77 K; however, the device
   breakdown characteristics are not as abrupt at temperatures below 200 K.
   On the other hand, contact resistance to p-GaN is reduced dramatically
   above room temperature, improving the overall device performance in GaN
   p-n diodes in all cases except where the n-type drift region resistance
   dominates the total forward resistance. In this case, the electron
   mobility can be deconvolved and is found to decrease with T-3/2,
   consistent with a phonon scattering model. Also, normally-on vertical
   junction field-effect transistors with BV = 1000 V and drain currents of
   4 A are fabricated and characterized over the same temperature range. It
   is demonstrated that vertical GaN devices (diodes and transistors)
   utilizing p-n junctions are suitable for most practical applications
   including automotive ones (210 K < T < 423 K). While devices are
   functional at cryogenic temperatures (77 K) there may be some
   limitations to their performance due the freeze-out of Mg acceptors.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study has been to assess the efficiency of
   choline-stabilized orthosilic acid (ch-OSA; bioavailabile form of
   silicon) application under increasing intensity of manganese stress on
   the chemical composition of plants and yielding of tomato (Lycopersicon
   esculentum Mill. cv. Alboney F-1 and cv. Emotion F-1). Plants were grown
   in rockwool with the application of a nutrient solution of the following
   chemical composition (mg dm(-3)): N-NH4 2.2, N-NO3 230, P 50, K 430, Ca
   145, Mg 65, Cl 35, S-SO4 120, Fe 2.48, Zn 0.50, Cu 0.07; pH 5.50, EC
   3.00 mS cm(-1). The following manganese levels in the nutrient solution
   were tested (mg dm(-3)): 9.6 and 19.2. The effect of ch-OSA application
   (at a concentration of Si equal 0.3 mg dm(-3) of the nutrient solution)
   was investigated at both Mn-levels. The ch-OSA application alleviated Mn
   toxicity by increasing the biomass production in the Mn-low variant (+
   8.2\% for Alboney F-1 and 16.8\% for Emotion F-1, the differences being
   significant for Emotion F-1), whereas the ch-OSA application in the
   Mn-high variant did not influence the plant yielding. All the factors
   affected the plant nutrient status and the chemical composition of
   tomato fruits. The chemical composition of leaves depended on (means of
   all the studied combinations): Mn (K, Na) and ch-OSA nutrition (N, Mg,
   Na), cultivar (for P, K, Ca, Na), but in the case of fruits significant
   differences were found between Mn (N, P, Ca, Mg) and ch-OSA nutrition
   (N, Mg, Na) and cultivar (N, P). In both Mn-levels, visual symptoms of
   manganese toxicity appeared on plants - in the Mn-high variant, they
   were observed after 4 weeks, while in the case of the Mn-low variant -
   after 10 weeks of exposure to strong Mn-stress. Treatment with ch-OSA at
   both of the studied Mn levels did not prevent the development of visual
   toxicity symptoms on the plants.}},

Abstract = {{Siting national infrastructure is a challenge for planning institutions
   due to recurrent low public acceptance and opposition by civil society.
   The use of Host community compensation (HCC) presents a possible
   solution for this challenge. HCC is compensation that a developer
   provides to a community in return for the siting of infrastructure. Yet,
   despite wide support for HCC, many such initiatives seem to fail. Those
   that do manage to have a good start in reaching an agreement suffer from
   neglected implementation. This study examines the factors that affect
   the willingness of stakeholders to suggest, accept and later implement
   the use of HCC. The study argues that HCC is a continual process which
   should be implemented against the backdrop of changing interests and
   power balances between stakeholders. The evolving power balance between
   stakeholders is argued to critically influence the acceptability of HCC
   and its implementation. By examining a 40-year-long case of HCC along
   the Israeli coast, the study suggests that the power balance fluctuates
   along the years as a function of external variables such as resource
   scarcity and internal factors such as stakeholders' cohesion, leadership
   and skills. Different power balance settings yield different settings of
   willingness to offer, accept or implement HCC, each with its own
   HCC.institutional design. However, once HCC is formed and designed, path
   dependency makes it much harder for civil society to repair a flawed HCC
   architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Emergent constraints are physically explainable empirical relationships
   between characteristics of the current climate and long-term climate
   prediction that emerge in collections of climate model simulations. With
   the prospect of constraining long-term climate prediction, scientists
   have recently uncovered several emergent constraints related to
   long-term cloud feedbacks. We review these proposed emergent
   constraints, many of which involve the behavior of low-level clouds, and
   discuss criteria to assess their credibility. With further research,
   some of the cases we review may eventually become confirmed emergent
   constraints, provided they are accompanied by credible physical
   explanations. Because confirmed emergent constraints identify a source
   of model error that projects onto climate predictions, they deserve
   extra attention from those developing climate models and climate
   observations. While a systematic bias cannot be ruled out, it is
   noteworthy that the promising emergent constraints suggest larger cloud
   feedback and hence climate sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the application of computer simulation methods to
   support decision making regarding intermediate buffer allocations in a
   series-parallel production line. The simulation model of the production
   system is based on a real example of a manufacturing company working in
   the automotive industry. Simulation experiments were conducted for
   different allocations of buffer capacities and different numbers of
   employees. The production system consists of three technological
   operations with intermediate buffers between each operation. The
   technological operations are carried out using machines and every
   machine can be operated by one worker. Multi-work in the production
   system is available (one operator operates several machines). On the
   basis of the simulation experiments, the relationship between system
   throughput, buffer allocation and the number of employees is analyzed.
   Increasing the buffer capacity results in an increase in the average
   product lifespan. Therefore, in the article a new index is proposed that
   includes the throughput of the manufacturing system and product life
   span. Simulation experiments were performed for different configurations
   of technological operations.}},

Title = {{Deep intrusions, lateral magma transport and related uplift at ocean
   island volcanoes}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{431}},
Pages = {{140-149}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Oceanic intraplate volcanoes grow by accumulation of erupted material as
   well as by coeval or discrete magmatic intrusions. Dykes and other
   intrusive bodies within volcanic edifices are comparatively well
   studied, but intrusive processes deep beneath the volcanoes remain
   elusive. Although there is geological evidence for deep magmatic
   intrusions contributing to volcano growth through uplift, this has
   rarely been demonstrated by real-time monitoring. Here we use
   geophysical and petrological data from El Hierro, Canary Islands, to
   show that intrusions from the mantle and subhorizontal transport of
   magma within the oceanic crust result in rapid endogenous island growth.
   Seismicity and ground deformation associated with a submarine eruption
   in 2011-2012 reveal deep subhorizontal intrusive sheets (sills), which
   have caused island-scale uplift of tens of centimetres. The pre-eruptive
   intrusions migrated 15-20 km laterally within the lower oceanic crust,
   opening pathways that were subsequently used by the erupted magmas to
   ascend from the mantle to the surface. During six post-eruptive episodes
   between 2012 and 2014, further sill intrusions into the lower crust and
   upper mantle have caused magma to migrate up to 20 km laterally,
   resulting in magma accumulation exceeding that of the pre-eruptive
   phase. A comparison of geobarometric data for the 2011-2012 El Hierro
   eruption with data for other Atlantic intraplate volcanoes shows similar
   bimodal pressure distributions, suggesting that eruptive phases are
   commonly accompanied by deep intrusions of sills and lateral magma
   transport. These processes add significant material to the oceanic
   crust, cause uplift, and are thus fundamentally important for the growth
   and evolution of volcanic islands. We suggest that the development of
   such a magma accumulation zone in the lower oceanic crust begins early
   during volcano evolution, and is a consequence of increasing size and
   complexity of the mantle reservoir system, and potentially the
   lithospheric stresses imposed by increasing edifice load. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to compare long-term outcomes in patients with
   refractory/relapsed grades 1 and 2 follicular lymphoma (FL) after
   allogeneic (allo) versus autologous (auto) hematopoietic cell
   transplantation (HCT) in the rituximab era. Adult patients with
   relapsed/refractory grades 1 and 2 FL undergoing first reduced-intensity
   allo-HCT or first autograft during 2000 to 2012 were evaluated. A total
   of 518 rituximab-treated patients were included. Allo-HCT patients were
   younger and more heavily pretreated, and more patients had advanced
   stage and chemoresistant disease. The 5-year adjusted probabilities,
   comparing auto-HCT versus allo-HCT groups for nonrelapse mortality (NRM)
   were 5\% versus 26\% (P <.0001); relapse/progression: 54\% versus 20\%
   (P <.0001); progression-free survival (PFS): 41\% versus 58\% (P <.001),
   and overall survival (OS): 74\% versus 66\% (P =.05). Auto-HCT was
   associated with a higher risk of relapse/progression beyond 5 months
   after HCT (relative risk {[}RR], 4.4; P <.0001) and worse PFS (RR, 2.9;
   P <.0001) beyond 11 months after HCT. In the first 24 months after HO',
   auto-HCT was associated with improved OS (RR,.41; P <.0001), but beyond
   24 months, it was associated with inferior OS (RR, 2.2; P =.006). A
   landmark analysis of patients alive and progression-free at 2 years
   after HO' confirmed these observations, showing no difference in further
   NRM between both groups, but there was significantly higher risk of
   relapse/progression (RR, 7.3; P <.0001) and inferior PFS (RR, 3.2; P
   <.0001) and OS (RR, 2.1; P =.04) after auto-HCT. The 10-year cumulative
   incidences of second hematological malignancies after allo-HCT and
   auto-HCT were 0\% and 7\%, respectively. Auto-HCT and reduced-intensity
   conditioned allo-HCT as first transplantation approach can provide
   durable disease control in grades 1 and 2 FL patients. Continued disease
   relapse risk after auto-HCT translates into improved PFS and OS after
   allo-HCT in long-term survivors. (C) 2015 American Society for Blood and

Abstract = {{Objective: The nuclear receptor estrogen receptor (ER) is one of the key
   players in energy balance, insulin resistance, and trophoblast
   differentiation. We tested the hypothesis that gestational diabetes
   mellitus (GDM) alters expression of placental ER in a cell type-specific
   manner and that this regulation may involve epigenetic changes.
   Study Design: Expression of ER was analyzed by immunohistochemistry
   using the semiquantitative immunoreactive score in 80 placentas (40
   GDM/40 controls). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   measured ER messenger RNA (mRNA) in decidual tissue.
   Methylation-specific PCR was performed to analyze
   cytosine-phosphatidyl-guanine-island methylation of the ER promoter.
   Results: Expression of ER protein is upregulated (P = .011) in GDM in
   extravillous trophoblasts but not in syncytiotrophoblast. Gestational
   diabetes mellitus downregulated ER in decidual vessels only in
   pregnancies with male but not female fetuses. Furthermore, mRNA of the
   ER encoding gene estrogen receptor gene 1 (ESR1) was increased (+1.77
   fold) in GDM decidua when compared to controls (P = .024). In parallel,
   the promoter of ESR1 was methylated only in decidua of healthy control
   individuals but not in GDM.
   Conclusion: Gestational diabetes mellitus affects expression of
   placental ER in a cell type-dependent way, on epigenetic level. These
   data link GDM with epigenetic deregulations of ER expression and open
   new insights into the intrauterine programming hypothesis of GDM.}},

Abstract = {{Since the first commercial planting of cocoa in Ghana more than a
   century ago, the production of cocoa has been a key factor in the
   redistribution of migrants and has played a pivotal role in the
   development of both sending and receiving communities. This process has
   been acknowledged in the literature for decades. However, how migration
   flows have changed in response to changing livelihoods dynamics of the
   frontier and how this has impacted on the development of the frontier
   has only attracted limited attention. Based on a study of immigration to
   Ghana's current cocoa frontier in the Western Region, this article aims
   to examine how immigration and frontier dynamics in the Western region
   are contributing to livelihood transitions and small town development,
   and how this process is gradually becoming delinked from the production
   of cocoa. The article focuses on how migration dynamics interlink with
   livelihood opportunities and strategies. It is argued that migrants to
   the current frontier can be divided into at least four different types
   based on their migration, settlement and livelihood practices.
   Accordingly, to understand how the cocoa frontier changes as well as its
   continuation beyond the frontier crop, there is a need for a broader
   understanding of the frontier concept, and how frontier transformation
   interacts with migration and livelihood dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The association between anatomic features of the left anterior
   descending artery (LAD) and outcomes in patients with anterior
   ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEW) has not been fully
   investigated. We sought to clarify the impact of an LAD coronary artery
   wrapping around the left ventricular (LV) apex on clinical outcomes in
   patients with anterior STEMI. Harmonizing Outcomes with
   Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction enrolled
   patients with STEM! presenting <12 hours after symptom onset who
   underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients with a
   culprit lesion in the LAD were categorized as (1) LAD wrapping around
   the LV apex (wrap-around LAD, n = 871) versus (2) LAD not wrapping
   around the LV apex (non wrap-around LAD, n = 224). Killip class >= II,
   dysrhythmia, and LV mural thrombi were more frequently observed in the
   wrap-around LAD group; LV ejection fraction was worse in the wraparound
   LAD group (54.5\% vs 58.7\%, p = 0.006). At 3 years of follow-up, major
   adverse cardiac events (death, stroke, or stent thrombosis, 12.7\% vs
   5.4\%, p = 0.002), death (6.6\% vs 3.2\%, p = 0.052), stroke (1.9\% vs
   0.5\%, p = 0.12), stent thrombosis (5.6\% vs 2.3\%, p = 0.047), and
   severe heart failure (4.5\% vs 1.4\%, p = 0.03) were more common in
   patients with a wrap-around LAD versus those with a non wrap-around LAD.
   Multivariate analysis indicated that a wrap-around LAD independently and
   significantly predicted major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio 2.18,
   p = 0.02) and severe heart failure (odds ratio 3.31, p = 0.049) in
   patients with an anterior STEMI. In conclusion, a wraparound LAD
   predicted adverse clinical outcomes at 3 years in patients with anterior
   STEMI who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In the n-alkane-assimilating yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, the
   transcription of ALK1, encoding cytochrome P450, that catalyses n-alkane
   hydroxylation is activated by a complex composed of Yas1p and Yas2p via
   a promoter element, ARE1, in response to n-alkanes. An Opi1-family
   transcription factor, Yas3p, represses the transcription by binding to
   Yas2p in the nucleus when cultured in glucose-containing medium, but it
   is localized to the ER, presumably through interaction with acidic
   phospholipids, phosphatidic acid and/or phospho inositides, when
   cultured in n-alkane-containing medium. Here, to elucidate the
   mechanisms regulating the localization of Yas3p, point and deletion
   mutants of Yas3p were constructed and analysed. The substitution of
   Trp(360) and Cys(361) by Arg abrogated the localization of Yas3p to the
   ER and decreased ARE1-mediated transcriptional activation by n-alkane. A
   Yas3p truncation mutant consisting of residues 259-422 did not bind to
   acidic phospholipids, but it was localized to the ER in the presence of
   n-alkane, implying the acidic-phospholipid-independent recruitment of
   this mutant to the ER in response to n-alkane. The W360R and C361R
   substitutions in this truncation mutant abolished its localization to
   the ER. The results suggest that these residues are implicated in the
   acidic phospholipid-independent interaction of Yas3p to the ER.

Abstract = {{Steroids hormones such as estradiol-17 beta (E2) and testosterone (T)
   are involved in gonadal differentiation of oviparous animals with
   temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), and are greatly
   distributed. This hypothesizes that these embryonic steroid hormones
   probably accumulate in the eggshell throughout blood or/and
   chorioallantoic fluid in sea turtle species with TSD, producing females
   at higher temperature. To demonstrate this hypothesis, concentrations of
   E2 and T in the blood plasma from the hatchling loggerhead sea turtle
   (Caretta caretta) and in their eggshells were measured by
   radioimmunoassay. In the present study we propose that both
   concentrations of E2 and T in the blood plasma are correlated with
   amounts of these sex steroids in the eggshell. Moreover, contents of E2
   in the eggshell showed a significant positive correlation with mean
   incubation temperatures during a thermosensitive period in the
   experimental nests, whereas T contents in the eggshell did not. Taken
   together, these findings indicated that embryonic E2 and T that
   accumulated in the eggshell can be extracted and measured. Furthermore,
   the present study suggested that contents of E2 in the eggshell may
   differ between male and female, and monitoring of these steroids is a
   useful method to identify the sex of loggerhead sea turtle hatchling.

Title = {{Estimates of tidal mixing in the Indonesian archipelago from
   multidisciplinary INDOMIX in-situ data}},

Abstract = {{The Indonesian Mixing program (INDOMIX) was designed to quantify the
   very strong mixing that transforms Pacific waters into isohaline
   Indonesian Waters in the Indonesian archipelago. The turbulent
   dissipation rates and associated mixing were estimated and analyzed
   using a multidisciplinary approach that combines physical and
   geochemical in-situ observations: (1) direct measurements of the
   dissipation using a microstructure profiler, (2) use of density-based
   fine-scale methods applied to CTD and XCTD data, and (3) study of the
   vertical distribution of natural radionuclides (radium isotopes and
   actinium-227). Data were collected at five contrasting stations within
   the Indonesian archipelago, found above energetic straits or in
   relatively quiescent large basins.
   Strong instabilities, inversions of the density profiles and a very
   strong water mass transformation were observed. A wide range of
   dissipation values were obtained (between {[}10(-10), 10(-4)] W kg(-1))
   with spots of higher dissipation in the ocean interior correlated with a
   strong internal tide signal. Both the fine-scale and micro-scale methods
   allow us to identify very strong energy dissipation levels above the
   straits, ranging between {[}10(-7), 10(-4)] W kg(-1), in contrast to
   lower values at stations further away from the generation sites. The
   dissipation for the station located in the center of the Halmahera Sea
   ({[}10(-9), 10(-8)] W kg(-1)) is stronger than for the Banda station
   ({[}10(-11), 10(-16)] W kg(-1)), which is even further away from the
   generation sites. The three approaches agree relatively well and provide
   vertical eddy diffusivities values ranging between 5 x 10(-4) and 5 x
   10(-1) m(2) s(-1), except in the Banda Sea where values are similar to
   the ones found in the open ocean (10(-6) m(2) s). CTD and XCTD profilers
   (deployed between stations) give estimates of dissipation all along the
   transit. It is found that enhanced mixing occurs preferentially above
   rough topography, such as in the Ombai Strait, the Halmahera Sea's
   northern entrance, the Buru strait and Sumba strait.
   Finestructure parameters are very sensitive to depth and dissipation,
   which differs between stations. We recommend more systematic
   microstructure measurement in order to tune these parameters. Surface
   mixing, at the base of the mixed layer is found to be very strong with
   values between {[}10-4, 10(-3) m(2) s(-1)]. These results confirm the
   modeling studies that suggest the occurrence of intensified subsurface
   mixing which cools the sea surface temperatures and thus strongly
   affects the mean and variability of the tropical climate. We conclude,
   therefore, that climate models need to take into account this
   intensified ocean mixing to properly represent the mean state of the
   atmosphere and its climate variability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The use of antibiotic prophylaxis in inguinal hernia repair is a
   controversial issue. Accepted randomized controlled trials or registry
   data with specific analysis of endoscopic repaired patients do not
   exist.
   The data presented in this study compared the prospectively collected
   data from the Herniamed Registry on all patients who had undergone
   unilateral, bilateral or recurrent repair of inguinal hernias using
   either endoscopic or open techniques between September 1, 2009, and
   March 5, 2014. In total, 85,033 patients were enrolled. Of these
   patients, 48,201 (56.7 \%) had an endoscopic and 36,832 (43.3 \%) an
   open repair. The target variables analyzed were impaired wound healing
   and deep infections with mesh involvement within 30 days after the
   operation.
   Analysis of the patient group with endoscopic/laparoscopic inguinal
   hernia repair (n = 48,201) did not identify any significant influence of
   antibiotic prophylaxis on postoperative impaired wound healing, which
   occurred in 53 cases (p = 0.6431). Nor was it possible to identify any
   significant impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on the deep infections seen
   in 27 cases (p = 0.8409). Analysis of the open inguinal hernia repair
   group revealed that, unlike the laparoscopic/endoscopic group,
   antibiotic prophylaxis had a significant impact on the postoperative
   impaired wound healing and deep infection rates. The risk of
   postoperative impaired wound healing with antibiotic prophylaxis was
   significantly lower {[}OR 0.677 (0.479; 0.958), p = 0.027].
   The positive impact of the endoscopic/laparoscopic technique on
   avoidance of impaired wound healing and deep infections with mesh
   involvement is already so great that antibiotic prophylaxis has no
   additional benefit. In contrast, antibiotic prophylaxis should be
   administered for open inguinal hernia repair.}},

Abstract = {{More than 20 years since the introduction of TAPP and TEP into clinical
   routine, there is a lack of clarity due to conflicting comparative data.
   Therefore, more results from registries are needed.
   A total of 17,587 patients were enrolled prospectively between September
   1, 2009, and April 15, 2013, in the Herniamed registry. Of these
   patients, 10,887 (61.9 \%) had a TAPP and 6700 (38.1 \%) a TEP repair.
   The dependent variables were intra- and postoperative complication
   rates, number of reoperations as well as absolute and relative
   frequencies. The results of unadjusted analyses were verified via
   multivariable analyses.
   Multivariable analysis verified the results of unadjusted analysis,
   indicating that the surgical technique did not have any significant
   impact, also while taking account of other factors, on occurrence of
   intraoperative {[}p = 0.1648; OR = 1.214 (0.923; 1.596)] and general
   postoperative complications {[}p = 0.0738; OR = 1.315 (0.974; 1.775)].
   Postoperative surgical complications {[}OR = 2.323 (1.882; 2.866); p <
   0.0001] were noted more often after TAPP. Furthermore, the hernia defect
   size {[}p < 0.0001; I vs III: OR = 0.439 (0.313; 0.615), II vs III: OR =
   0.712 (0.582; 0.872)] or scrotal {[}p < 0.0001; OR = 2.170 (1.501;
   3.137)] hernia and age {[}p = 0.0002; 10-year OR = 1.135 (1.062; 1.213)]
   had a significant impact on the occurrence of postoperative
   complications. Complications were observed more commonly for larger
   hernia defects and a scrotal hernia. However, the difference in the
   postoperative complication rate between TEP and TAPP did not result in
   any difference in the reoperation rate (TEP 0.82 \% vs TAPP 0.90 \%; p =
   0.6165).
   The intraoperative and general postoperative complication rates as well
   as the reoperation rate for complications show no significant difference
   between TEP and TAPP. The higher postoperative complication rate for
   TAPP, which could be managed conservatively, is partly explained by
   larger defect sizes, more scrotal hernias and older age.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation of spatial and temporal changes of river width and
   width variability is a suitable tool for analysing morphological changes
   and estimating the ecological quality of a river, e.g. for the European
   Water Framework Directive. However, width and width variance interact
   closely with the varying hydraulic and sedinnentological conditions in
   the river. In general, a high width variance is often accompanied by a
   high depth, flow and sediment diversity which in turn is an indicator
   for the existence of different micro- (river bed) and mesohabitats (e.g.
   riffles and pools). The width variance provides information on the
   morphodynannics and resilience of a river. It also gives some indication
   of the length of the river banks and the number of diverse and
   ecologically vital habitats in the river bed, along the riparian zone
   and in the floodplain.
   This study examines changes of the channel width and width variation of
   the river Elbe and compares different methods while quantitatively
   assessing these hydronnorphological parameters. Dependent on the
   discharge, width and width variation for different spatial situations
   (e.g. river bed, floodplain) are determined for a historical (1830-1850)
   and a current condition. These data are statistically analysed and
   compared to obtain a five-point scale evaluation.
   Based on the results, this study should give recommendations as to which
   method is best suited in terms of various aspects. Special consideration
   will be given to different ecological issues.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the same week, two Labrador Retriever dogs presented to The Ohio
   State University Veterinary Medical Center for cardiac evaluation. The
   presenting signs in both dogs included: weight loss, weakness, lethargy,
   and decreased femoral pulses. The first dog presented in cardiogenic
   shock and biventricular congestive heart failure, which initially
   responded to treatment; however, the dog was euthanized due to
   deteriorating clinical condition. In contrast, the second dog had a
   milder clinical course without signs of congestive heart failure, and
   remained stable over the 2-month period of clinical evaluation prior to
   euthanasia.
   Echocardiographic evaluation revealed a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype
   in the first dog, while a space-occupying intraluminal mass originating
   at the aortic valve with preserved left ventricular systolic function
   was observed in the second dog. At autopsy, each dog had a large
   obstructive luminal mass affecting the ascending aorta and arch.
   Histopathology revealed that the mass in the first dog was consistent
   with a benign chondroma, while in the second dog the morphologic
   characteristics, mitotic activity, and infiltrative growth justified a
   diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. This report presents the contrasting
   clinical disease progression and findings in two dogs with aortic
   neoplasia, with a proposed pathogenesis of cardiac failure secondary to
   aortic neoplasia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade there has been an increased incidence of Acanthamoeba
   keratitis, particularly in contact lens wearers. The aim of this study
   was to utilize in vitro killing assays and to establish a novel,
   time-lapse, live-cell imaging methodology to demonstrate the efficacy of
   contact lens care solutions in eradicating Acanthamoeba castellann (A.
   castellann) trophozoites and cysts. Standard qualitative and
   quantitative in vitro assays were performed along with novel time-lapse
   imaging coupled with fluorescent dye staining that signals cell death.
   Quantitative data obtained demonstrated that 3\% nonophthalmic hydrogen
   peroxide demonstrated the highest percent killing at 87.4\%
   corresponding to a 4.4 log kill. The other contact lens care solutions
   which showed a 72.9 to 29.2\% killing which was consistent with 4.3-2.8
   log reduction in trophozoite viability. Both analytical approaches
   revealed that polyquaternium/PHMB-based was the least efficacious in
   terms of trophicidal activity. The cysticidal activity of the solutions
   was much less than activity against trophozoites and frequently was not
   detected. Live-imaging provided a novel visual endpoint for
   characterizing the trophocidal activity of the care solutions. All
   solutions caused rapid rounding or pseudocyst formation of the
   trophozoites, reduced motility and the appearance of different
   morphotypes. Polyquaternium/alexidine-based and peroxide-based lens care
   system induced the most visible damage indicated by significant
   accumulation of debris from ruptured cells. Polyquaternium/PHMB-based
   was the least effective showing rounding of the cells but minimal death.
   These observations are in keeping with care solution biocides having
   prominent activity at the plasma membrane of Acanthamoeba. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background. Given substantial advances in venovenous extracorporeal
   membrane oxygenation (ECMO) technology, long-term support is
   increasingly feasible. Although the benefits of short-term ECMO as a
   bridge to recovery in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are
   well described, the utility and outcomes of long-term support remain
   unclear.
   Methods. Patients requiring ECMO for ARDS between January 2009 and
   November 2012 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed separately for
   those requiring ECMO support for less than 3 weeks or for 3 weeks or
   longer. Demographic factors, ECMO variables, and outcomes were assessed.
   Results. Fifty-five patients with ARDS received ECMO during the study
   period, with 11 patients requiring long-term ECMO support and a median
   duration of 36 (interquartile range: 24 to 68) days. Recovery was the
   initial goal in all patients. Pre-ECMO mechanical ventilatory support,
   indices of disease severity, and the ECMO cannulation strategy were
   similar between the two groups. Eight (73\%) patients receiving
   long-term support were bridged to recovery, and 1 patient was bridged to
   transplantation after a refractory course. Eight (73\%) patients
   receiving long-term support and 25 (57\%) patients receiving short-term
   support survived to 30 days and hospital discharge.
   Conclusions. Previously, long-term ECMO support was thought to be
   associated with unfavorable outcomes. This study, however, may provide
   support for the efficacy of ECMO support even for 3 weeks or more as a
   bridge to recovery or transplantation. (C) 2015 by The Society of

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the geometrical nonlinear elastic instability for
   slender lattice-boom structures of crawler cranes. To reduce the
   dimension of equilibrium equations, the slender lattice-boom structure
   is divided into several substructures and an element-independent
   co-rotational substructure element is formulated. Including the
   discretization of gravity, a static condensation procedure for the
   co-rotational substructure element is implemented. In consideration of
   movable boundaries of the lattice-boom structure, the tensile forces of
   luffing cables related to the guyed mast rotation are given for the
   equilibrium equations. After that, accurate tangent stiffness matrices
   are formulated by taking the derivative of the generalized nodal forces
   with respect to the structural displacements and the guyed mast angle.
   To improve the computational efficiency of instability analysis under
   multiple loading conditions, a new method for identifying the
   instability loads of the slender lattice-boom structures is presented,
   based on the equilibrium equations in rate form. Two numerical examples
   show the availability and efficiency of the method. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Adaptively biasing recognition judgments in light of environmental cues
   improves net accuracy. Based on previous work suggesting that
   strategically shifting biases on a trial-wise basis should be
   cognitively demanding, the authors predicted that older adults would not
   achieve the same accuracy benefits from environmental cues as the young.
   However, despite showing clear declines in cognitive control as indexed
   by complex span, older adults demonstrated similar accuracy gains and
   similar alterations of response probabilities with cues of 75\%
   reliability (Experiment 1) and more complex cues spanning 3 levels of
   reliability (Experiment 2). Despite preserved gains in accuracy, older
   adults clearly demonstrated disproportionate slowing that was specific
   to trials in which cues were invalid. This slowing may reflect
   impairments in behavioral inhibition that could impinge upon accuracy
   were responding increasingly sped and future work manipulating response
   speed and measures of inhibition may yield further insights.}},

   Testing a new child measure in middle childhood}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe constructs of closeness, conflict, and dependency, which
   are derived from attachment theory, are widely used to qualify teachers'
   perceptions of relationships with individual children.
   AimsOur main aim was to reveal whether similar and reliable dimensions
   could be identified in middle childhood with a newly developed student
   measure Student Perception of Affective Relationship with Teacher Scale
   (SPARTS). Additional validity support was sought by examining gender
   differences and associations with (1) teacher relationship perceptions
   and (2) problem and prosocial behaviours in children.
   Sample(s)Factor structure was determined in a sample of 586 children
   (46.5\% boys) from 26 regular elementary Dutch classrooms (grade 4-6).
   Associations with teacher relationship reports (n=82) and child
   behaviours (n=64) were analysed in random subsamples.
   MethodsStudents' relationship perceptions were assessed with the SPARTS;
   teachers' relationship perceptions with the Student-Teacher Relationship
   Scale (STRS; closeness, conflict, and dependency); and problem and
   prosocial behaviours in children with the teacher-reported Strengths and
   Difficulties Questionnaire.
   ResultsExploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis
   supported a 3-factor model of conflict, closeness, and a third factor,
   unexpectedly reflecting negative expectations of the student instead of
   dependency. Satisfactory internal consistency was found for all three
   scales. Additional validity evidence included the following: Substantial
   student-teacher agreement for conflict and closeness; meaningful
   associations with problem and prosocial behaviours in children; and
   expected gender differences showing that, compared to boys, girls share
   more favourable relationships (more closeness and less conflict) with
   teachers.
   ConclusionsThe 3-dimensional SPARTS comes close to the
   attachment-derived teacher STRS, as far as conflict and closeness are
   concerned. The third dimension, negative expectations, represents a new
   and relevant attachment-related dimension reflecting a lack of
   confidence of students in the relationship with their teacher.}},

   (CBF) based on data of 45 municipalities and regions in 27 countries:
   (1) A distinction has been made between trends and pressures (on which
   urban IWRM has a negligible influence) and IWRM performances. Therefore,
   a separate trends and pressures framework has been developed; (2) Only
   the purely performance-oriented indicators have been selected from the
   CBF. Furthermore, the indicator accuracy and boundaries have been
   re-assessed, and new indicators have been added; (3) By analyzing
   correlations and variances, the performance-oriented indicators have
   been rearranged in order to establish a proportional contribution of all
   indicators and categories to the overall score, i.e., the Blue City
   IndexA (R). In conclusion, six indicators have been removed because of
   insufficient accuracy, overlap or lack of focus on IWRM. Seven
   indicators have been added, i.e., secondary and tertiary wastewater
   treatment, operation cost recovery, green space and three indicators
   concerning solid waste treatment. The geometric aggregation method has
   been selected because it emphasizes the need to improve the lowest
   scoring indicators. In conclusion, the improved CBF is more
   performance-oriented and therefore more suitable to assist cities in
   their transition towards water-wise cities.}},

Abstract = {{Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicles (FWMAVs) hold the potential to both
   cover large distances and perform precision flights when arrived at
   destination. However, flying at different speeds leads to a complex
   control problem for attitude stabilization. Inspired by nature, we
   present a morphing mechanism that allows tailed FW-MAVs to have a
   passively stabilized attitude both in fast forward flight and in slow
   hovering flight. The mechanism displaces the wings and hence aerodynamic
   center. It is implemented on the DelFly II and tested in-flight in a
   motion tracking arena. The experimental tests show that the morphing
   mechanism indeed allows to fly passively stable in multiple flight
   modes. Just changing the aerodynamic center allows the DelFly II to fly
   fast forward (similar to 6 m/s, pitch attitude of 10 degrees),
   transition to slow forward flight (similar to 0.8 m/s, pitch attitude of
   55 degrees), and back. The proposed mechanism paves the way for FWMAVs
   performing long range missions such as search-and-rescue.}},

Abstract = {{The paper investigates synthetic and hybrid synthetic jet actuators that
   are based on similar geometries. The actuators are supplied by a
   harmonic power input and are operated close to the first resonance
   frequency. An energetic efficiency is applied. The maximal outlet
   characteristic velocities and efficiencies of both actuators are studied
   as functions of the input real power. Theoretical approximations of
   these functions were derived for the synthetic jet actuator and
   successfully compared with experimental hot-wire results.
   The paper demonstrates a usefulness of the applied definition of the
   energetic efficiency. Moreover, the advantages of the hybrid synthetic
   jet actuator were quantified. The hybrid synthetic jet actuator achieves
   a 15-23\% increase in the velocities and a 41-48\% increase in the
   energetic efficiency, both in comparison with the ordinary synthetic jet
   actuator working at the same input real power. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Plasma collisions in magnetic fields play an important role in the
   acceleration of particles and radiation generation in astrophysical
   objects and in the high intensity laser plasma interaction. In
   laser-target interaction the expanding plasmas can be created with the
   Target Normal Sheath Acceleration mechanism, TNSA. The possibility to
   observe the Weibel filamentation in two inter-penetrating TNSA plasmas
   in an ambient magnetic field is studied theoretically and numerically in
   the present work. Relying on 2D3V Particle-In-Cell simulations and
   analytical estimates, the effect of the decreasing density profile
   coupled to the increasing flow velocity on the external magnetic field
   accumulation and the development of the magnetic vortexes is analyzed.
   It is demonstrated that with realistic TNSA profiles the plasma
   collision can lead to magnetic field accumulation and to the development
   of magnetic vortexes. These results are of interest for interpretation
   of the experiments which may be carried out in this regime on high

Abstract = {{Although targeted therapies are initially effective, resistance
   inevitably emerges. Several methods, such as genetic analysis of
   resistant clinical specimens, have been applied to uncover these
   resistance mechanisms to facilitate follow-up care. Although these
   approaches have led to clinically relevant discoveries, difficulties in
   attaining the relevant patient material or in deconvoluting the genomic
   data collected from these specimens have severely hampered the path
   towards a cure. To this end, we here describe a tool for expeditious
   discovery that may guide improvement in first-line therapies and
   alternative clinical management strategies. By coupling preclinical in
   vitro or in vivo drug selection with next-generation sequencing, it is
   possible to identify genomic structural variations and/or gene
   expression alterations that may serve as functional drivers of
   resistance. This approach facilitates the spontaneous emergence of
   alterations, enhancing the probability that these mechanisms may be
   observed in the patients. In this protocol we provide guidelines to
   maximize the potential for uncovering single nucleotide variants that

Abstract = {{A modeling platform for microbial electrodes based on electroactive
   microbial biofilms performing direct electron transfer (DET) is
   presented. Microbial catabolism and anabolism were coupled with
   intracellular and extracellular electron transfer, leading to biofilm
   growth and current generation. The model includes homogeneous electron
   transfer from cells to a conductive biofilm component, biofilm matrix
   conduction, and heterogeneous electron transfer to the electrode. Model
   results for Geobacter based anodes, both at constant electrode potential
   and in voltammetric (dynamic electrode potential) conditions, were
   compared to experimental data from different sources. The model can
   satisfactorily describe microscale (concentration, pH and redox
   gradients) and macroscale (electric currents, biofilm thickness)
   properties of Geobacter biofilms. The concentration of electrochemically
   accessible redox centers, here denominated as cytochromes, involved in
   the extracellular electron transfer, plays the key role and may differ
   between constant potential (300 mM) and dynamic potential (3 mM)
   conditions. Model results also indicate that the homogeneous and
   heterogeneous electron transfer rates have to be within the same order
   of magnitude (1.2 s(-1)) for reversible extracellular electron transfer.

Abstract = {{Background Mechanical dispersion (MD), defined as the standard deviation
   of time to maximum myocardial shortening assessed by 2D speckle tracking
   echocardiographic strain imaging (2DS), has been recently proposed as a
   predictor for ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) in
   patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and long QT syndrome. However, the
   role of MD in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) has not
   yet been studied.
   Methods and results In 20 patients with NICM (mean age 62 +/- 11 years,
   75 \% male, mean EF 32 +/- 6 \%, mean QRS duration 102 +/- 14 ms), we
   measured longitudinal strain by 2DS in a 16-segment left ventricular
   model and calculated the MD. Patients were divided into two groups,
   defined by the presence or absence of documented VT/VF. In 11 patients
   (55 \%), VT/VF was documented. The median time from VT/VF to
   echocardiographic examination was 26 (IQR 15-58) months. There were no
   significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients
   with and without index events. MD was significantly greater in patients
   with VT/VF as compared to those without arrhythmias (84 +/- 31 ms vs. 53
   +/- 16 ms, p = 0.017). The analysis of the ROC curve (AUC 0.81, 95 \% CI
   0.63-1.00, p = 0.017) revealed that dispersion > 50 ms is associated
   with twelve times higher risk of VT/VF in patients with NICM (OR 12.5,
   95 \% CI 1.1-143.4, p = 0.024).
   Conclusion In this small cohort of NICM patients, greater MD was
   associated with a higher incidence of VT/VF.}},

Abstract = {{BAG3 belongs to BAG family of molecular chaperone regulators interacting
   with HSP70 and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. It is ubiquitously expressed
   with strong expression in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and is involved
   in a panoply of cellular processes. Mutations in BAG3 and aberrations in
   its expression cause fulminant myopathies, presenting with progressive
   limb and axial muscle weakness, and respiratory insufficiency and
   neuropathy. Herein, we report a sporadic case of a 15-years old girl
   with symptoms of myopathy, demyelinating polyneuropathy and asymptomatic
   long QT syndrome. Genetic testing demonstrated heterozygous mutation
   Pro209Leu (c.626C > T) in exon 3 of BAG3 gene causing severe myopathy
   and neuropathy, often associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy. We did
   not find a mutation in any known LQT syndrome genes. Analysis of muscle
   biopsy revealed profound disintegration of Z-discs with extensive
   accumulation of granular debris and large inclusions within fibers. We
   demonstrated profound alterations in BAG3 distribution as the protein
   localized to long filamentous structures present across the fibers that
   were positively stained not only for a-actinin but also for desmin and
   filamin indicating that those disintegrated Z-disc regions contained
   also other sarcomeric proteins. The mutation caused a decrease in the
   content of BAG3 and HSP70, and also of a-actinin desmin, filamin and
   fast myosin heavy chain, confirming its severe effect on the muscle
   fiber morphology and thus function. We provide further evidence that
   BAG3 is associated with Z-disc maintenance, and the Pro209Leu mutation
   may occur worldwide. We also provide a summary of cases associated with
   this mutation reported so far.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{148-153}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many modeling studies have indicated that aerosol interactions with
   clouds increase the upper tropospheric humidity (UTH), but observational
   evidences are sparse. Using satellite datasets of upper tropospheric
   humidity and aerosols, this study shows that aerosols increase the upper
   tropospheric humidity over the tropical North West Pacific (NWP) and
   North East Pacific (NEP). The observations show an increase in the UTH
   by 2.8\%RH over NEP for an increment of 0.12 in aerosol optical depth
   (ADD) and 2\%RH increase in UTH over NWP for an increment of 0.19 in
   AOD. The study also quantifies the change in longwave cloud radiative
   forcing (LWCRF) as a consequence of the increase in UTH due to aerosols.
   The LWCRF increases by 3.38 W m(-2) over NEP and by 4.46 W m(-2) over
   NWP. The result that aerosols increase the upper tropospheric humidity
   is significant since the latter plays a crucial role in regulating the
   Earth's radiation budget and water vapor feedback. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to investigate the potential of gas assisted
   mechanical expression (GAME) process as an innovative technology for oil
   extraction and polyphenol recovery from tiger nuts. GAME process was
   first studied by varying the supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and
   the mechanical expression (ME) pressures (10-30 MPa), then was compared
   to separate processes applied alone, using either SC-CO2 or ME. The
   results showed that the better conditions for GAME were found using 20
   MPa for SC-CO2 and 30 MPa for ME. Under these conditions, 50\% of oil
   was released from tiger nuts after 10 min extraction, compared to only
   10\% and 20\% when using SC-CO2 and ME separately at 20 and 30 MPa
   pressures, respectively. In addition to the faster extraction of oil
   using GAME process, the obtained results showed that this oil contains
   higher amount of polyphenols than that obtained using either SC-CO2 or
   ME. These molecules were extracted and identified using ultra
   performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry
   (UPLC-HRMS). Polyphenol profiles showed that GAME process led to the
   maximum polyphenol's recovery with 57 compounds, followed by SC-CO2 with
   48 compounds, and ME process with only 27 compounds, concurring with the
   trends observed for total phenolic compounds. Although nonsignificant
   differences were observed in oil recovery after applying GAME or SC-CO2
   alone, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that GAME had
   a higher impact on cell structure, which can facilitate the release of
   important valuable compounds. All of these results pave the way towards
   the industrialization of GAME process as an innovative and alternative
   technology for enhanced oil extraction, thus replacing the conventional
   processes. Industrial relevance: The increasing need in application of
   more efficient extraction processes in full correspondence with green
   extraction concept has led to deeper interest in new non-conventional
   methods that can reduce the extraction time, process temperature and
   consumption of toxic solvents (i.e. hexane). For instance, gas assisted
   mechanical expression (GAME) technology may constitute a useful tool for
   food industry as it allows to improve oil recovery and the amount of
   bioactive compounds (polyphenols) from tiger nuts, compared to
   supercritical fluid extraction and conventional methodologies
   (mechanical expression and hexane extraction) thus avoiding the use of
   toxic solvents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Supersaturated designs (SSDs) are defined as fractional factorial
   designs whose experimental run size is smaller than the number of main
   effects to be estimated. The main goal using the class of SSDs is to
   identify the important effects efficiently, that is, at a minimal
   computational cost and time. Several methods for analyzing SSDs have
   been proposed in recent literature. While most of the literature on SSDs
   has focused on main effects models, the analysis of such designs
   involving models with interactions has not been developed to a great
   extent. In this paper, we attempt to relate several penalty and loss
   functions with support vector machines, with one main goal in mind,
   screening active effects in SSDs. In this spirit, we propose a penalized
   wrapper screening method for identifying in one stage the important main
   effects and two-factor interactions of two-level SSDs, by assuming
   generalized linear models. We also carry out simulation studies and a
   real data analysis to assess the performance of the proposed screening
   procedure, showing that the proposed method works satisfactorily.

   Design and Methodology - Research was carried out by surveying different
   segments of bicyclists, recognized in earlier conceptual contributions.
   Electronic data collection techniques were applied. The online
   questionnaire was distributed to chosen respondents in the form of the
   link included in a personal message on a certain social network. A
   personal approach ensured a high response rate. The nature of research
   design resulted in a descriptive research, although some of its
   characteristics could be considered as exploratory.
   Findings - This paper is the first attempt to study the Croatian segment
   of the bicycle tourism demand. As far as the attributes common to both
   national and international research are concerned, it is possible to
   argue the similarities and differences of demand profiles.
   Value - Until there is a uniform approach to monitoring the phenomenon
   at the European level, the profiling of demand in bicycle tourism makes
   it possible to compare the specific findings with current trends. This
   research applies a somewhat different perspective than the existing ones
   - enabling more insight into the cycling-related behaviour in the home
   area and on vacation. As part of the international demand for bicycle
   tourism, knowledge about the behaviour of one particular national market
   contributes to the general state of the research.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its superior sliding, erosive and abrasive wear properties
   WC-Co-Cr coatings are used in the coating industry. A series of
   WC-10Co-4Cr coatings (80-375 mu m thick) have been prepared on a
   corrosion-resistant steel substrate with a new multi-chamber gas-dynamic
   accelerator (MCDS) with different powder feed rates (1200, 1500 and
   2000, all in g/h). The influence of the powder feed rate on structural
   characteristics, hardness and wear resistance of the coatings was
   characterized. The microstructures and properties of the WC-10Co-4Cr
   coatings were examined with the use of optical microscopy, scanning
   electron microscopy, X-ray phase analysis, and a Vicker's hardness
   tester at a test load of 300 g. The wear behavior was carried out by the
   ball-on-disk tests. From the results, it was observed that the powder
   feed rate has influence on coating porosity, hardness and wear
   resistance. Porosity and wear resistance decreased with decreasing
   powder feed rate. It was found that a powder feed rate of 1200 g/h
   yielded minimum porosity of less than 0.2\% and minimum specific wear
   rate of 1.234.10(-6) mm(3)(m N)(-1). With an increase in the powder feed
   rate the hardness of the coatings increases. It was found that the
   coatings obtained at powder feed rate of 2000 g/h showed high hardness
   967 +/- 230 HV0.3. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All

   first-a questionnaire study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: To influence self-referral, it is crucial to know a
   patient's motives to directly visit the emergency department (ED). The
   goal of this study is to examine motives for self-referral to the ED and
   compare these motives in relation to appropriateness.
   Methods: All self-referred patients visiting the ED of a Dutch hospital
   over four separate months in a 1-year period were included. Patients
   were handed questionnaires that included questions on their reasons to
   visit the ED directly and where they would seek medical help next time.
   Additionally, the motives of patients that either appropriately or
   inappropriately visited the ED were compared. In a previous study on the
   same patient cohort, the appropriateness of the ED visits was determined
   using predefined criteria.
   Results: A total of 3196 self-referred patients were included, and 48.9
   \% completed the questionnaires. The majority of patients (28.0 \%)
   attended the ED without a referral because they thought they would get
   help faster; the next reason was the easier access to radiologic and
   laboratory investigations (answered by 23.8 \%); and the third was the
   symptoms were considered too severe to visit a general practitioner (GP)
   (answered by 22.7 \%). The majority (78.5 \%) would attend the ED the
   next time they are faced with similar symptoms. Appropriate visits were
   significantly more seen in females, elderly, and patients in higher
   triage categories. Patients who expect investigations are necessary,
   think their symptoms are too severe to visit a GP, or would return to
   the ED next time were more often appropriately visiting the ED.
   Conclusions: The choice of patients to self-refer to an ED is often an
   explicate decision. Patients are looking for specialist help and want
   fast and easy access to radiologic and laboratory investigations. Even
   though the primary care network is well developed in the Netherlands,
   the reasons for self-referral are similar to the reasons found in
   previous literature based in other countries. Patients who visit the ED
   because of health concerns visit the ED more often appropriately than
   patients visiting for practical reasons.}},

   Investigating the histology of the perirectal fascia and the pelvic

Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Excellent understanding of fasciae and nerves surrounding the
   rectum is necessary for total mesorectal excision (TME). However,
   fasciae anterolateral to the rectum and surrounding the low rectum are
   still poorly understood. We studied the perirectal fascia enfolding the
   extraperitoneally located part of the rectum in en-bloc cadaveric
   specimens and the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) pelvic
   dataset, and describe implications for TME.
   Methods: Four donated human adult cadaveric specimens (two males, two
   females) were obtained through the Leeds GIFT Research Tissue Programme.
   Paraffin-embedded blocks were produced and serially sectioned at 50 and
   250 mu m intervals. Whole mount sections were stained with haematoxylin
   \& eosin, Masson's trichrome and Millers' elastin. Additionally, the
   UMCU pelvic dataset including digitalised cryosections of a female
   pelvis in three axes was studied.
   Results: The mid and lower rectum were surrounded by a multi-layered
   perirectal fascia, of which the mesorectal fascia (MRF) and parietal
   fascia bordered the `holy plane'. There was no extra constant fascia
   forming a potential surgical plane. Nerves ran laterally to the MRF.
   More caudally, the mesorectal fat strongly reduced and the MRF
   approached the rectal muscularis propria. The MRF had a variable
   appearance in terms of thickness and completeness, most prominently at
   the anterolateral lower rectum.
   Conclusion: Dissection onto the MRF allows nerve preservation in TME.
   Rectal surgeons are challenged in doing so as the MRF varies in
   thickness and shows gaps, most prominently at the anterolateral lower
   rectum. At this site, the risk of entering the mesorectum is great and
   may result in an incomplete specimen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate the potentiating effect of PACAP27 on
   cholinergic neuromuscular transmission in the recently discovered flexor
   muscles of the land snail, Helix pomatia. Using immunohistochemistry, we
   show that PACAP and PAC1 receptors are present in nerve fibers
   innervating the flexor muscles but not in the muscle itself. We also
   observed that PACAP27 exerts both pre- and postsynaptic effects on the
   cholinergic synapse and performed tests using a broad spectrum of
   chemicals in order to explore the possible intracellular pathways
   through which PACAP mediates its stimulatory effect. Our pharmacological
   data demonstrate that PACAP27 presynaptically enhances the release of
   acetylcholine by activating the adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA pathway.
   Postsynaptically, PACAP27 was found to enhance muscle contractility by
   PKC-mediated signaling pathway resulting in an increased Ca2+ release
   from intracellular stores. These findings suggest that regulation of
   Ca2+ release may contribute to the stimulatory effect of PACAP. Our data
   are the first demonstration of the potentiating effect of PACAP27 at the
   molluscan excitatory neuromuscular contact.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms leading to higher risks of infection in diabetics remain
   unknown despite recent advances in the understanding of associated
   immunological and metabolic aberrations. Hyperglycemia and
   hyperlipidemia in diabetics not only contribute to altered metabolism
   but glucose and free fatty acids can directly activate inflammation and
   the production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1
   beta). Long-chain saturated fatty acids,activate toll-like receptor 4
   (TLR4), generating diacylglycerol and activating protein kinase C to
   upregulate the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
   pathway. High glucose uptake switches cell metabolism from oxidative
   phosphorylation to glycolysis and deactivates AMP-activated protein
   kinase (AMPK), a critical sensor of nutrient and cellular energy,
   leading to mTORC1 activation. A deleterious consequence of mTORC1
   activation is the suppression of autophagy which is a catabolic process
   for the lysosomal degradation of damaged organelles, protein aggregates
   and intracellular pathogens. In addition, high glucose concentration and
   fatty acids independently activate inflammasome, an intracellular
   multi-protein complex that promotes the proteolytic activation of
   caspase 1, leading to the processing and secretion of IL-1 beta. Other
   caspases induced by inflammasome can trigger apoptotic cell death. A
   common upstream signal for the activation of inflammasome and mTORC1 is
   oxidative stress, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) from
   dysregulated mitochondria. Increased flux of glucose and lipids
   activates stress kinases, enhances electron transport, and generates ROS
   in mitochondria. Mitochondrial stress arising from increased
   mitochondrial respiration and permeability damages mitochondria,
   activates caspases, which then induce apoptosis via the intrinsic cell
   death pathway releasing mitochondrial DNA. Normally apoptosis is
   down-regulated by autophagy as autophagy removes damaged organelles as a
   result of danger and stress signals. However, in diabetics,
   hyperactivation of mTORC1 disrupts the host autophagic degradation of
   microbes and damaged mitochondria which in turn exacerbates inflammasome
   activation and alters cell resistance to infection. Recognition of viral
   lipids and bacterial components by host cell pattern recognition
   receptors including TLR activates NF kappa B and stress kinase c-jun
   N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. The transcription factor NF kappa B
   and JNK independently induce inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and
   further activate inflammasome. The convergence of inflammasome and
   mTORC1 activation with metabolic stress and vascular dysfunction in
   diabetics prevents pathogen clearance and contributes to an increased
   risk of infection. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the problem of tracking the generated reference
   trajectory by the simulation model of a multi-DOF robot arm. The
   kinematic transformation between task space and joint configuration
   coordinates is nonlinear and configuration dependent. To obtain the
   solution of the forward kinematics problem, the homogeneous
   transformation matrix is used. A solution to the inverse kinematics is a
   vector of joint configuration coordinates calculated using of
   pseudoinverse Jacobian technique. These coordinates correspond to a set
   of task space coordinates. The algorithm is presented which uses
   iterative solution and is simplified by considering stepper motors in
   robot arm joints. The reference trajectory in Cartesian coordinate
   system is generated on-line by the signal generator previously developed
   in MS Excel. Dynamic Data Exchange communication protocol allows sharing
   data with Matlab-Simulink. These data represent the reference tracking
   trajectory of the end effector. Matlab-Simulink software is used to
   calculate the representative joint rotations. The proposed algorithm is
   demonstrated experimentally on the model of 7-DOF robot arm system.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical trends of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the variance of the
   three wind velocity components in the atmospheric boundary layer have
   been established from Doppler mini-sodar measurements. Over the course
   of a 5-day period of measurements in the autumn time frame from 12 to 16
   September 2003, values of the variance of the x- and y-components of the
   wind velocity lay in the interval from 0.001 to 10 m(2)/s(2), and for
   the z-component, from 0.001 to 1.2 m(2)/s(2). They were observed to grow
   during the morning hours (around 11: 00 local time) and in the evening
   (from 18: 00 to 22: 00 local time), which is explained by the onset of
   heating and subsequent cooling of the Earth's surface, which are
   accompanied by an increase in the motion of the air masses. Analysis of
   the obtained vertical profiles of the standard deviations of the three
   wind velocity components showed that growth of sigma(x) and sigma(y)
   with altitude is well described by a power-law dependence with its
   exponent varying from 0.22 to 1.3 as a function of the time of day while
   sigma(z) varies according to a linear law. At night (from 00: 00 to 5:
   00 local time) the variance of the z-component changes from 0.01 to 0.56
   m(2)/s(2), which is in good agreement with the data available in the
   literature. Fitting parameters are found and the error of the
   corresponding fits is estimated, which makes it possible to describe the
   diurnal dynamics of the wind velocity variance.}},

Abstract = {{In the made in italy fast-fashion sector, the ultimate flexible workers
   are Chinese migrants, whose parenting practices include circulating
   children back to China. This paper draws on collaborative research in
   Prato, Italy, to grasp how Chinese families and individuals encounter
   the Italian state and negotiate the terms of transnational capitalism.
   The project innovates an encounter ethnography framework to guide
   research. This paper investigates the dialectic between economics and
   affect. Chinese immigrants' desires to make money are situated in three
   structural encounters, each at a different level of scale: the Wenzhou
   regional model of economic development; a Central Italian small-firm
   environment connected to the made in italy brand; and global
   restructuring of the textile and clothing industry. These encounters
   structure migrant experiences. Underlying sentiments expose how families
   cope with the demands of globalization, particularly their work in a
   sector demanding long hours and a fast production schedule. Adjusting to
   garment work is expressed as a ``fistful of tears{''}; a decision to
   circulate children into the care of relatives back home is said to be
   ``the only solution{''}. This paper uses the concept of ``global
   household{''} (Safri and Graham 2010) to examine the transnational
   dispersal of kin networks and migrants' reliance on the affective
   circuits of those networks. They illuminate, as Marshall Sahlins (2000)
   observed, how ``capitalist forces are realized in other forms and
   finalities{''}, as a result of local cultural practices such mediating
   global systems.}},

Abstract = {{Mineral exploration is undertaken in stages, with each stage designed to
   get to the next decision point of whether or not to keep exploring a
   particular area based on the results at hand. As a general rule, each
   consecutive exploration stage is more expensive due to the progressively
   more drill-and study-intensive nature of the work required, in
   particular after discovery of a potentially economic mineral deposit. As
   such, the distribution of exploration activities and related
   expenditures essentially serve as a spatial measure of prospectivity as
   perceived by mineral exploration companies. In this study we compare
   historic (1980 to 2002) porphyry Cu-Au exploration activities and
   expenditures in part of the Ordovician to Early Silurian Macquarie Arc,
   Australia's most significant porphyry province with total resources
   greater than 80 Moz of Au and 13 Mt of Cu, to prospectivity modelling
   results from a weights of evidence (WofE) model. The outcomes of this
   spatial and statistical comparison indicate that at 2002 the Macquarie
   Arc was by no means a mature exploration destination and that past
   exploration investment outside the main mining areas was not necessarily
   effective. Moreover, no spatial correlation was apparent between areas
   of higher exploration expenditure and greater geological potential. For
   example, of the 692 km(2) of highly prospective ground covered by the
   exploration licences examined in this study, only 89 km2 (c. 13\%) have
   been explored effectively in that they received some form of drilling.
   Interestingly, the remaining area (603 km2 or c. 87\%) had not yet been
   effectively tested. As such, our analysis confirmed that despite a
   greater 100 year exploration and mining history, much of the prospective
   ground within the study area remained untested. Taken as a whole, the
   results of our spatial and statistical comparison are important inputs
   for assessing the effectiveness of exploration investment and
   explanation maturity and, therefore, future exploration decision-making.
   The outcomes also have implications for strategic planning of future
   government legislation helping to manage and maximise the benefits from
   exploration investment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2311-2348}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In 1970, Congress enacted the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to
   address concerns that inadequate safeguards existed to protect consumers
   in their interactions with credit reporting agencies. Government
   regulation of credit reporting is critical because the structure of the
   credit reporting industry does not adequately incentivize credit
   reporting agencies to maintain accuracy in consumers' credit reports.
   Since the enactment of the FCRA, the role of credit in the modern
   consumer economy has expanded drastically to occupy a central role in
   consumer transactions. However, though technological advances have
   increased the ability of agencies to maintain accuracy in credit
   reports, credit reporting errors have remained surprisingly prevalent.
   This Note argues the continued prevalence of errors in credit reports
   stems largely from the inability of federal and state actors to
   meaningfully enforce the FCRA's requirements against credit reporting
   agencies. In light of the inadequacies of the FCRA's enforcement
   mechanisms, this Note suggests that both state attorneys general and the
   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should eschew enforcement of credit
   reporting under the FCRA and instead seek to regulate credit reporting
   agencies through application of the new federal ban on abusive practices
   propounded by the Consumer Financial Protection Act.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of the ``Guidelines for the development of
   agricultural biogas plants in Poland within 2010-2020{''}, is a
   construction of biogas plants processing agricultural biomass resources
   with suitable conditions in each municipality. In the Czech Republic
   produces about 6.5\% of energy from renewable sources. Biogas plants
   give - contrary to solar and wind electricity stations - the stable
   performance throughout the whole year. Biomass should be a key source
   for achieving the Czech EU commitment to produce 13\% of energy from
   renewable sources in 2020. The experience, where 317 Agricultural biogas
   plants are currently in operation, has shown that there are considerable
   problems with a proper location of newly designed agricultural biogas
   plants in the landscape. The Czech-Polish border area is mainly flat
   wooded recreation region. For these reasons, the Gaussian model SYMOS'97
   (version 2013), adapted for odour dispersion modelling from large
   agricultural sources is supposed to be suitable for this area. It is
   appropriate for training of students. For these reasons, students from
   the University of Hradec Kralove and the University of Opole in the
   frame of their academic exchange and professional internships are
   acquainted with the technological principles of biogas plants and in
   environmental mathematical and statistical modelling of the spread of
   emissions from large industrial and agricultural sources. In this
   article we present methods for education on these professional areas.}},

Abstract = {{The article has two objectives: First, pursuant to the recent papers on
   a ``sociology of (e)valuation,{''} an extension of Bourdieusian field
   theory will be presented, which reacts to three problems with this
   theory that were expressed in the critical reception: the immanent
   tendency to emphasize reproduction more strongly than transformation;
   the disregarding of technology; and the simple dualism of cultural and
   economic logic. To begin with, a dynamization of the research program
   will be undertaken, in that fault lines and transformation dynamics will
   be revealed that could lead to the invalidation of Pierre Bourdieu's
   strict homological assumptions. Following up on that, it will be shown
   how technology, which was neglected by Bourdieu, can become an
   (external) factor that causes fundamental changes in fields. Finally, in
   connection with Jorn Lamla's reflections on ``cultural capitalism{''}
   and through a differentiation of the concept of the instance of
   consecration, a level of analysis will be specified on which the
   transformation dynamics under discussion can be observed. Secondly, the
   successful integration of technology in new forms of consecration in the
   field of pop music will be examined. On the basis of the reaction of
   classical pop-music journalism to the new value assignment instances
   that have arisen through digitalization, it can be shown that the
   challenge arising from new forms of consecration results in negotiatory
   processes in the field of pop music journalism in which various
   repositionings in the relationship of cultural and economic logics
   appear.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Context The Chronic Care Model (CCM) has been developed to improve the
   quality of medical care delivered by general practitioners to patients
   with multiple chronic conditions. Despite an increasing use of this
   model, it remains unclear to what extent the different recommendations
   are valued by the patients.
   Objective This study aims to identify the preferences of patients with
   multiple chronic conditions for recommendations of the Chronic Care
   Model.
   Methods The patients' preferences were identified with a discrete choice
   experiment. The hypothetical general practice cares were described using
   10 recommendations of the Chronic Care Model (i.e. shared decision
   making; informational continuity (INF); regular follow-up; planned care;
   communication; collaboration with a nurse; advices on health habits;
   patient empowerment; psychological support; coordination). Respondents
   were consecutively recruited in a hospital setting during routine
   follow-up visits to their pulmonary specialist. The sample of
   respondents included 150 patients with multiple chronic conditions in
   addition to an obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.
   Results The INF is highly valued by the patients. At the opposite,
   patients do not appear to value collaboration between nurses and GPs. To
   a large extent, the patients' preferences for the recommendations of the
   CCM depend on their gender, number of chronic conditions and
   self-perceived health condition.
   Discussion The INF appeared to be a minimal requirement to ensure
   high-quality general practice care. The significant interactions between
   the patients' socio-demographic characteristics and their preferences
   for the CCM highlighted the necessity to deliver personalized services.}},

Journal = {{EMBO REPORTS}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1656-1663}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Toll-like receptor (TLR) 13 and TLR2 are the major sensors of
   Gram-positive bacteria in mice. TLR13 recognizes Sa19, a specific 23S
   ribosomal (r) RNA-derived fragment and bacterial modification of Sa19
   ablates binding to TLR13, and to antibiotics such as erythromycin.
   Similarly, RNase A-treated Staphylococcus aureus activate human
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) only via TLR2, implying
   single-stranded (ss) RNA as major stimulant. Here, we identify human
   TLR8 as functional TLR13 equivalent that promiscuously senses ssRNA.
   Accordingly, Sa19 and mitochondrial (mt) 16S rRNA sequence-derived
   oligoribonucleotides (ORNs) stimulate PBMCs in a MyD88-dependent manner.
   These ORNs, as well as S. aureus-, Escherichia coli-, and mt-RNA, also
   activate differentiated human monocytoid THP-1 cells, provided they
   express TLR8. Moreover, Unc93b1(-/-)- and Tlr8(-/-)-THP-1 cells are
   refractory, while endogenous and ectopically expressed TLR8 confers
   responsiveness in a UR/URR RNA ligand consensus motif-dependent manner.
   If TLR8 function is inhibited by suppression of lysosomal function,
   antibiotic treatment efficiently blocks bacteria-driven inflammatory
   responses in infected human whole blood cultures. Sepsis therapy might
   thus benefit from interfering with TLR8 function.}},

Title = {{National and State Attitudes of US Adults Toward Tobacco-Free School
   Grounds, 2009-2010}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Schools are an important environment for addressing tobacco
   use among youth. Tobacco-free school policies can help reduce the social
   acceptability of tobacco use and prevent tobacco initiation among youth.
   This study assessed attitudes toward tobacco-free school grounds among
   US adults.
   Methods Data came from the 2009-2010 National Adult Tobacco Survey, a
   telephone survey of adults aged 18 or older in the 50 US states and
   District of Columbia. Respondents were considered to have a favorable
   attitude toward tobacco-free school grounds if they reported tobacco use
   should be completely banned on school grounds, including fields and
   parking lots, and at all school events. Data were assessed using
   descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression, overall
   and by tobacco use status. Correlates were sex, age, race/ethnicity,
   education, marital status, income, sexual orientation, US region, and
   whether respondent lived with any children aged 17 years or younger.
   Results Nationally, 86.1\% of adults had a favorable attitude toward
   tobacco- free school grounds, with larger percentages among nontobacco
   users (91.9\%) than current users (76.1\%). State prevalence ranged from
   80.0\% (Kentucky) to 90.9\% (Washington). Overall odds of favorable
   attitudes were higher among nontobacco users (referent, current users),
   women (referent, men), and adults aged 25 or older (referent, aged
   18-24); odds were lower among residents of the South (referent, West)
   and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender adults (referent,
   heterosexual or straight).
   Conclusion Nearly 9 in 10 US adults have a favorable attitude toward
   tobaccofree school grounds, but attitudes vary across states and
   subpopulations. Opportunities exist to educate the public about the
   benefits of tobacco-free school grounds, which might help reduce tobacco
   use among youth.}},

Title = {{The effect of motor-respiratory coordination on the precision of
   tracking movements: influence of attention, task complexity and training}},

Abstract = {{Purpose We investigated motor-respiratory coordination (MRC) in visually
   guided forearm tracking movements focusing on two main questions: (1)
   Does attentional demand, training or complexity of the tracking task
   have an effect on the degree of MRC? (2) Does MRC impair the precision
   of those movements? We hypothesized that (1) enhanced attention to the
   tracking task and training increase the degree of MRC while higher task
   complexity would reduce it, and (2) MRC impairs tracking precision.
   Methods Thirty-five volunteers performed eight tracking trials with
   several conditions: positive (direct) signal-response relation (SRR),
   negative (inverse) SRR to increase task complexity, specific instruction
   for enhanced attention to maximize tracking precision ({''}strict{''}
   instruction), and specific instruction that tracking precision would not
   be evaluated ({''}relaxed{''} instruction). The trials with positive and
   negative SRR were performed three times each to study training effects.
   Results While the degree of MRC remained in the same range throughout
   all experimental conditions, a switch in phase-coupling pattern was
   observed. In conditions with positive SRR or with relaxed instruction,
   we found one preferred phase relationship per period. With higher task
   complexity (negative SRR) or increased attentional demand (strict
   instruction), a tighter coupling pattern with two preferred phase
   relationships per period was adopted. Our main result was that MRC
   improved tracking precision in all conditions except for that with
   relaxed instruction. Reduction of amplitude errors mainly contributed to
   this precision improvement.
   Conclusion These results suggest that attention devoted to a precision
   movement intensifies its phase coupling with breathing and enhances
   MRC-related improvement of tracking precision.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation occurs in structures when subjected to large-strain-rate
   loading that commonly occurs in ballistic and asteroid impacts. In
   ductile materials, fragmentation is preceded by localized plastic
   deformation forming multiple adiabatic shear-bands. The
   shear-band-spacing thus formed controls the final fragment-size
   distribution. The observed fragment-size distribution is different from
   the theoretically predicted values. The above discrepancy can be
   deciphered by simulating multiple-shear-band formation that accounts for
   both thermal- and shear-void-growth-softening (which is often ignored).
   We model the shear-void-growth-softening by using the extended
   Gurson-model Nahshon-Hutchinson model)) in our method of
   characteristics-based finite-difference solution methodology. We perform
   parametric simulations varying the shear-void-growth-rate. Our results
   indicate that the number of shear-bands increases linearly with increase
   in the shear-void-growth-rate for any applied strain-rate. The average
   shear-band-spacing thus predicted is reduced, signifying the important
   role of shear-void-growth-softening in the simulations of
   multiple-shear-band formation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the use of spinal anesthesia by reducing anesthetic
   agent dose to provide better analgesia with minimal side effects without
   sacrificing the outpatient setting for prostate biopsy. In this study,
   efficacy and tolerability of selective low-dose spinal anesthesia versus
   intrarectal local anesthesia (IRLA) plus periprostatic nerve blockade
   (PPNB) were compared. Methods: Between September 2012 and April 2013,
   100 patients, aged 40 to 80 years, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
   4ng/mL, abnormal digital rectal examinations, and enrolled for biopsy
   were included in the present study. Ensuring double blindness, pain was
   assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS). Anal sphincter relaxation,
   patient satisfaction with the anesthesia technique, and motor response
   were evaluated. Results: Differences between the two groups, considering
   age, American Society of Anesthesiologist score, total PSA, prostate
   volume, anesthesia duration, and cancer presence, were not statistically
   significant. Pain experienced during probe insertion, biopsy, and 30
   minutes after biopsy was significantly lower in the low-dose spinal
   anesthesia group (P<0.0001). Anal sphincter relaxation degree was
   significantly higher in the spinal group (P<0.001). Patient
   procedure-related overall satisfaction level was significantly higher in
   the spinal anesthesia group (P<0.001). In the spinal anesthesia group,
   no motor blockade was observed. Between the two groups, no statistically
   significant difference was seen with regard to complications (P>0.05).
   Conclusion: Selective low-dose spinal anesthesia provides better pain
   relief than PPNB plus IRLA without sacrificing the day case setting in
   ambulatory practice. It is also associated with high patient
   satisfaction and willingness for a repeated biopsy without differences
   in procedure duration, tolerance, and complications.}},

   impact of the presence of oxygen on the efficiency of photocatalytic
   oxidation of the psychotropic drug - carbamazepine. The oxygen was
   supplied to the reaction medium as a mixture of gases present in
   atmospheric air by means of an aeration pump or in pure form using an
   oxygen concentrator. The HPLC analysis preceded by solid-phase
   extraction was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the process. It was
   demonstrated that the presence of oxygen was an essential factor for the
   proper conduction of photochemical processes. With the increase of the
   oxygen concentration the increase in the removal rate of tested
   psychotropic drug was observed. In addition, the study evaluated the
   possibility of generation of toxic by-products of the oxidation and
   reduction of carbamazepine using Microtox (R) biotest. It was found,

Abstract = {{In previous galactic dynamo theories of the origin of the magnetic field
   in our galaxy, the subject of flux-freezing has been omitted. As a
   consequence, the equation of mass flow has generally also been omitted,
   particularly in the halo where the galactic gravitational field will
   operate on the mass flow. In this paper, it has been shown that this
   neglect could have serious consequences for the results obtained from
   those galactic dynamo simulations that include the halo. A modification
   of these dynamo theories is proposed which involves the expulsion of
   very small pieces of the magnetic field lines, rather than the wholesale
   expulsion of the complete magnetic lines encapsulated in the previous
   theories. This expulsion is accomplished by a spike instability that
   arises from superbubbles when they break out of the galactic disc and
   their shells fragment. This leads to a cut in the lines of force that
   still remain in the disc. Subsequently, normal disc turbulence rotates
   the cut lines and thus dissipates their mean flux, removing them from a
   role in the dynamo theory. This new process takes a length of time
   comparable to, but slightly longer than, the previous growth time of the
   disc dynamo, but avoids the previous difficulties associated with flux
   freezing and flux expulsion.}},

Abstract = {{Shimla is one of the 80 hill stations which were established on
   preferred locations during British rule in India. It is the summer
   capital of pre independent India, planned and developed for a maximum
   population of 25,000 in a picturesque hill setting. Presently, Shimla is
   capital of the state of Himachal Pradesh, one of the most preferred
   tourist destinations in the country and the most important
   administrative and educational centre in the region. It houses a
   population of 169,000, as per 2011 census, which is much more than its
   planned capacity. As a result, to meet the demand of residential,
   commercial, educational, work and recreational facilities for this ever
   increasing population; Shimla once famous for its natural settings,
   beautiful buildings and marvelous townscape; has undergone tremendous
   change and has numerous issues and problems of development. It is one of
   the very few examples of tremendous urban development in environmentally
   sensitive and picturesque hill settings.
   An attempt is made to understand the context of development in Shimla,
   by highlighting the pattern of development along with different planning
   interventions made to achieve regulated development in the form of
   development plans, land-use plan/s and building regulations. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are conventionally expanded and
   maintained in vitro on biological substrates. Synthetic electrospun
   polymer nanofibers have the potential to act as non-biological
   substrates in the culture of hESCs. Three synthetic, FDA approved
   polymers: poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL), poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and
   poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) were electrospun as nanofibers
   (random or aligned conformations) on glass coverslips and their
   supportive role in hESC culture examined. Clonogenicity experiments
   demonstrated that nanofibrous scaffolds (PCL aligned and random, PLLA
   aligned and PLGA aligned) supported hESC adhesion and expansion. A
   significantly greater number of colonies were observed on PCL-aligned
   nanofibrous scaffolds in comparison to PLLA-aligned and PLGA-aligned
   substrates (p < 0.05). hESC colonies were significantly larger on PCL
   aligned nanofibrous substrates when compared to other polymer substrates
   (p < 0.05-0.001), where fiber diameter played a pivotal role in support
   of hESC clonogenicity (on PCL). Retention of pluripotentiality was
   confirmed by expression of Alkaline phosphatase, OCT-3/4 and Nanog
   expression on PCL scaffolds and the expression of transcripts
   representative of mesoderm (ACTC1), ectoderm (SOX1) and endoderm (AFP)
   during subsequent spontaneous in vitro differentiation. These results
   demonstrate the potential of nanofibers as xeno-free scaffolds
   supportive of hESC adhesion, self-renewal and differentiation in in
   vitro culture conditions.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPEECH TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{649-662}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we discuss the role of fundamental frequency f(0) and
   formants F-1, F-2 and F-3 of the speech signal in supervised and
   unsupervised source separation of real recorded convolutive speech
   mixtures. Initially supervised source separation is discussed where it
   is assumed that sources are known a priori. The supervised source
   separation is discussed by considering (1) only fundamental frequency
   f(0), (2) only formants F-1, F-2 and F-3, (3) both f(0) and formants
   F-1, F-2 and F-3. It is observed that last case which involves both f(0)
   and formants gives most accurate separation results and is used as ideal
   case or reference to compare the separation results obtained for
   unsupervised source separation. The unsupervised source separation is
   discussed, where there is no knowledge about the sources a priori. The
   unsupervised source separation is discussed using (1) cross correlation
   of formants of different frames along with f(0) and (2) standard
   deviation of magnitude of frequency components in F-1, F-2 and F-3
   regions of the spectrogram. It is observed that separation results
   obtained using both unsupervised methods are very close to the ideal
   case in supervised source separation. The results show that this method
   works better than some of the classical blind source separation
   algorithms like independent component analysis and non negative matrix
   factorization which works well only for the case of instantaneous
   mixtures where delay is neglected.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted during 2010-13, on a sandy-loam soil at
   Pusa, Bihar to find out optimum nutrient and irrigation requirement of
   French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) when intercropped with autumn
   sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrid complex). Fifteen treatment
   combinations consisted of 5 fertility levels {[}sugarcane + French bean
   (1: 2) with 100\% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) to both the crops
   and residue incorporation, sugarcane + French bean (1: 2) with 100\% RDF

   sugarcane + French bean (1: 2) with 100\% RDF to sugarcane and 100\% N
   to French bean and residue removal (existing recommendation), sugarcane
   + French bean (1: 2) with 100\% RDF to sugarcane and 100\% N and P to
   French bean and residue incorporation, sugarcane + French bean (1: 2)
   with 100\% RDF to sugarcane and 100\% N and K to French bean and residue
   incorporation) and 3 irrigation schedules {[}no irrigation, 1 irrigation
   at 45 days after sowing (DAS) and 2 irrigations at 45 and 75 DAS] were
   evaluated in factorial randomized block design with 2 additional
   treatments as sole sugarcane and sole French bean. Application of 100\%
   RDF to sugarcane and French bean with residue incorporation produced
   significantly higher grain (1.15 t/ha) and haulm yield (1.90 t/ha) of
   French bean. The treatments of sugarcane + French bean with 100\% RDF to
   both the crops and residue incorporation, sugarcane + French bean with
   100\% RDF to sugarcane and 100\% N and K to French bean and residue
   incorporation and sugarcane + French bean with 100\% RDF to sugarcane
   and 100\% N and P to French bean and residue incorporation being similar
   noticed significantly enhanced cane-equivalent yield (100.0, 95.8 and
   94.8 t/ ha), gross returns ((SIC)22,29,400; 2,19,600 and 2,17,300/ ha),
   net returns ((SIC)21,41,900; 1,33,100 and 1,30,100/ha) and benefit: cost
   ratio (2.62, 2.53 and 2.49), respectively, over rest of the treatments.
   The same treatment also accounted for higher land-equivalent ratio,
   area-time equivalent ratio and N, P and K uptake of sugarcane and French
   bean with greater available N, P and K status in post-harvest soil.
   Among the irrigation schedules, the highest cane yield (89.0 t/ha),
   French bean grain (1.20 t/ha), haulm yield (1.98 t/ha) and cane
   equivalent yield (106.0 t/ha) were recorded in treatment that received 2
   irrigations at 45 and 75 DAS. Similarly, the maximum land equivalent
   ratio, area time-equivalent ratio, gross returns, net returns, benefit:
   cost ratio and N, P and K uptake was noted from the enhanced levels of
   irrigation. The sugar yield was significantly increased with each
   successive increase in level of irrigation. Considering the total
   productivity and economics, sugarcane + French bean (1: 2) with 100\%
   RDF to sugarcane and 100\% N and K to French bean and residue
   incorporation, could be adopted under similar agro-ecological situations
   with twice irrigation up to the period of French bean at 45 and 75 DAS
   and normal irrigation for sugarcane after harvest of French bean.}},

Abstract = {{Many applications, such as intelligent transport system and mobile
   multimedia, use Internet-based vehicular ad hoc networks (IVANETs). In
   IVANETs, users often access multimedia content from anywhere using
   Internet connectivity to remote video streaming servers. Due to the high
   mobility of the nodes in IVANETs, however, maintaining quality of
   service (QoS) for these video streaming applications with respect to
   parameters such as jitter, throughput, buffering, and transmission
   delays is a challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a
   new QoS-aware hierarchical web caching (QHWC) scheme in IVANETs. We
   propose two new metrics, namely, load utilization ratio (LUR) and query
   to connectivity ratio (QCR), to maintain the QoS for various video
   streaming applications in IVANETs. We compare the performance of our
   proposed QHWC scheme with past approaches, such as dynamic service,
   weighted segment, and machine learning based, using various parameters
   such as QCR, communication cost, query delay, cache hit ratio, query
   generation rate, invalidation cost, and cache update interval. Our
   results demonstrate that the proposed QHWC scheme yields an average
   decrease of 16.75\% and 22\% in communication cost and query relay,
   respectively, and an average increase of 9.31\% in cache hit ratio.
   Moreover, the invalidation cost reduces by 26.26\% (on average) in our
   proposed scheme compared with other schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To investigate the diagnostic performance of perfusion
   single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography
   (Q-SPECT/CT) in patients suspected to have pulmonary embolism (PE) but
   with indeterminate computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or
   planar ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans.
   Methods This retrospective study included two groups of patients. Group
   I consisted of 49 patients with nondiagnostic CTPA. These 49 patients
   underwent subsequent V/Q scans. Further Q-SPECTs were obtained in
   patients with indeterminate planar images and fused with existing CTPA.
   Group II consisted of 182 non-CTPA patients with indeterminate V/Q
   scans. These 182 patients underwent further Q-SPECT and separate
   noncontrast low-dose CT chest. Fusion Q-SPECT/CT scans were obtained
   through FDA-approved software and interpreted according to published
   criteria as positive, negative, or indeterminate for PE. Upon
   retrospective analyses, the final diagnosis was made using composite
   reference standards including all available clinical and imaging
   information for at least 6-month follow-up.
   Results In group I patients, 1 was positive, 24 were negative, and
   another 24 (49 \%, 24/49) were indeterminate. In the subsequent 24
   Q-SPECT/CTPAs, 4 were positive, 19 were negative, and 1 was
   indeterminate (4.2 \%, 1/24). In group II patients, 9 (4.9 \%, 9/182)
   were indeterminate, 33 were positive, and 140 were negative. The
   combined nondiagnostic rate for Q-SPECT/CT was only 4.9 \% (10/206).
   There was six false-negative and one false-positive Q-SPECT/CT
   examinations. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
   predictive value of Q-SPECT/CT were 85.7 \% (36/42), 99.4 \% (153/154),
   97.3 \% (36/37) and 96.2 \% (153/159), respectively.
   Conclusions Q-SPECT/CT improves the diagnostic rate with promising
   accuracy in diagnosing PE that yields a satisfactory clinical verdict,
   especially when the CTPA and planar V/Q scan are indeterminate.}},

Abstract = {{There are several evidences supporting the role of 5-10
   methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR) gene polymorphisms in
   breast cancer (BC). Case control association studies on breast cancer
   have been repeatedly performed over the last two decades, but results
   are inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis to confirm the
   association between MTHFR C677Tpolymorphism and BC risk.
   The articles were retrieved by searching the PubMed, Google Scholar, and
   Springer Link databases. Crude odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs) was used to assess the strength of association between
   C677T polymorphism and BC. Publication bias was assessed by Egger's and
   Begg-Mazumdar tests. Meta- analysis was performed with Open Meta
   Analyst.
   Total 75 studieswith 31,315 cases and 35, 608 controlswere found
   suitable for the inclusion in the present metaanalysis. The results
   ofmeta-analysis suggested that therewere moderate significant
   association between C677T polymorphism and BC risk using overall
   comparisons in five geneticmodels (T vs. C: OR= 1.08, 95\% CI= 1.031.13,
   p = b0.001; TT + CT vs. CC: OR= 1.06, 95\% CI= 1.02-1.09, p = b0.001; TT
   vs. CC: OR= 1.17, 95\% CI = 1.06-1.28, p = 0.001; CT vs. CC OR =
   1.05,95\% CI = 1.01-1.08, p = 0.005; TT vs. CT + CC: OR = 1.12, 95\% CI=
   1.03-1.22, p= 0.005). In conclusion, results of present meta-analysis
   showed modest association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism with breast
   cancer in total studies. However, sub-group analysis results based on
   ethnicity showed strong significant association between TT genotype and
   breast cancer ( TT vs. CC; OR degrees=degrees 1.26; 95\% CI: 1.06- 1.51;
   p= 0.009) in Asian population but in Caucasian population such
   associationwas not observed (TT vs. CC; OR degrees=degrees 1.08; 95\%
   CI: 0.99-1.14; p = 0.05). (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A bottom-up green synthesis method has been used to synthesize
   zero-valent iron nanoparticles taking Emblica officinalis leaf extract
   as reducing and stabilizing agent at ambient temperature and using FeCl3
   solution as a source of iron to be reduced. UV-Vis spectroscopy,
   scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction have confirmed the
   fabrication of green synthesized zero-valent iron nanoparticles. In the
   UV-Vis spectrum, there was a shift in absorption peak ranging between
   350 and 600 nm wavelengths. Nearly, spherical zero-valent iron
   nanoparticles having average size of 22.6 nm were obtained through this
   synthesis method. Fourier transform infrared spectrum reveals that the
   biomolecules are responsible for the synthesis and stabilization of the
   green synthesized zero-valent iron nanoparticles. Diffraction peak at 2
   theta of 44.9 degrees in X-ray powder diffraction spectrum illustrates
   the presence of pure metallic alpha-Fe nanoparticles with zetapotential
   value -26.7 mv. With the application of 20 ml l(-1) concentration, green
   synthesized zero-valent iron nanoparticles were found very efficient for
   the remediation of 10, 20, 50 and 100 ppm of lead from aqueous medium
   within 24 h and the efficiency was positively correlated with the
   application time period and concentration of GZVINPs.}},

Abstract = {{InGaAs graded metamorphic buffers (MBs) with different grading
   strategies have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on GaAs (0 0

   force microscopy (AFM), and bulk properties using high resolution X-ray
   diffraction (HRXRD) and room temperature photoluminescence (RTPL) of
   grown MBs have been presented to comprehend the effectiveness of
   different grading scheme on InGaAs MBs. Conventional, statistical and
   fractal analysis on measured AFM data has been performed for in-depth
   investigation of these surfaces. The grading scheme has been found to
   have little impact on residual strain while it affects the epitaxial
   tilt significantly. Moreover, the tilt has been found to depend on
   growth front irregularities. Tilt magnitude in a graded MB has been
   found to vary with composition while tilt azimuth has been found to be
   almost same in the graded layers. PL Intensity and a shift in the PL
   peaks have been used to study the quality of the MB and residual strain
   comparatively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the partially-averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) simulation is
   performed for a turbulent thermal plume. The aim of the paper is to
   assess the PANS method for modeling buoyancy-driven flows at a
   reasonable computational cost. PANS is a turbulence closure model which
   is developed to be used as a bridging model ranging from the direct
   numerical simulation to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation
   by varying the level of resolution. The PANS computations are performed
   for various values of the filter-width to evaluate the sensitivity of
   the filter-widths to the computed flow statistics. The present
   simulations have been carried out employing a source code
   buoyantPimpleFOAM based on the OpenFOAM platform. In order to capture
   the effect of buoyancy on turbulence, the generalized gradient diffusion
   hypothesis is employed to model the production of turbulence due to
   buoyancy. A detailed comparison of the time-averaged and turbulent
   statistics obtained from the PANS simulations with the experimental data
   and LES results reported in the literature has been presented. The
   present results have also been compared with the results of the unsteady
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solutions. The PANS model is shown to
   enhance the computing capability significantly in predicting
   buoyancy-driven flows compared with those of URANS model. Finally,
   various important unsteady flow structures of turbulent thermal plume
   have been visualized from the instantaneous flow statistics obtained
   using the PANS simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Genomic constitution of commercially cultivated sugarcane varieties over
   the world is derived from few basic species clones of Saccharum complex.
   In order to impart new cytoplasmic and nuclear genome in sugarcane
   hybrids, untapped wild species of Saccharum spontaneum (S), Erianthus
   arundinaceus (E) and E. bengalense (Eb) were utilized to produce
   different combinations i.e., E. arundinaceus x S. spontaneum (ES), S.
   spontaneum x E. arundinaceus (SE) and S. spontaneum x E. bengalense
   (SEb) intergeneric hybrids (H). Subsequently, these resulting hybrids
   were repeatedly used as pistil parent and crossed with commercial
   sugarcane varieties as pollen parent for three (G(3)) to four (G(4))
   generations to produce an array of advanced generation hybrids. Twenty
   six such advanced generation hybrids (G(3) and G(4)) derived were
   evaluated for quality and yield contributing traits at 300 and 360 days
   after planting during 2010-2011 and 11-12 in augmented block design
   along with standard sugarcane varieties. The presence of E. arundinaceus
   cytoplasmic DNA was validated in intergeneric hybrids by PCR-RFLP of the
   amplified chloroplast DNA for psbC-trnS. Performance of ESH G(3) and SEH
   G(4) hybrids were comparable and some E. arundinaceus cytoplasm
   introgressed hybrids performed on par with standard varieties for yield
   and quality traits. Few intergeneric hybrids exhibited wider
   acclimatization in diverse agro-climatic conditions. Some of these
   intergeneric hybrids have potential for commercial cultivation and their
   utilization in breeding programme could help in broadening the genetic
   base and also for wider adaptability of future sugarcane varieties.}},

Pages = {{91-97}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rotating packed bed (RPB) is a doughnut shaped bed, which is spun at
   high speed to generate centrifugal force to pass fluid through an
   adsorbent bed at a high velocity. The centrifugal force, which is much
   larger than the gravitational force reduces mass transfer resistance for
   transporting adsorbate molecules to the adsorbent. In this study, the
   optimum condition of the working parameters of a RPB contactor for
   removal of chromium by activated carbon was investigated with the aid of
   Taguchi method. Four parameters, namely, rotating speed (rpm), feed rate
   (L/h), packing density (kg/m(3)) and initial solution pH were chosen as
   the control factors while initial concentration of chromium was chosen
   as the external noise factor. The optimum condition for the adsorption
   was found to be rotating speed (rpm) of 1200 (level 3), feed rate (L/h)
   of 50 (level 4), packing density (kg/m(3)) of 179 (level 3), and initial
   solution pH of 2 (level 1). The experimental and predicted S/N ratios
   with values 39.26 and 39.20 were in very good agreement with each other
   at the optimum condition. A removal of 91\% was obtained at the optimum
   condition. Pseudo second order kinetics described the adsorption rate
   satisfactorily while the mechanism could be described by the film
   diffusion model. (C) 2015 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Title = {{Cross-correlation of CFHTLenS galaxy catalogue and Planck CMB lensing
   using the halo model prescription}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Aims. I cross-correlate the galaxy counts from the Canada-France Hawaii
   Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) galaxy catalogue and cosmic
   microwave background (CMB) convergence from the Planck data releases 1
   (2013) and 2 (2015).
   Methods. I improve on an earlier study by computing an analytic
   covariance from the halo model, implementing simulations to validate the
   theoretically estimated error bars and the reconstruction method,
   fitting both a galaxy bias and a cross-correlation amplitude using the
   joint cross and galaxy auto-correlation, and performing a series of null
   tests.
   Results. Using a Bayesian analysis, I find a galaxy bias b =
   0.92(-0.02)(+0.02) and a cross-correlation amplitude A =
   0.85(-0.16)(+0.15) for the 2015 release, whereas for the 2013 release, I
   find b = 0.93(-0.02)(+0.02) and A = 1.05(-0.15)(+0.15).
   Conclusions. I thus confirm the difference between the two releases
   found earlier, although both values of the amplitude now appear to be
   compatible with the fiducial value A = 1.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most challenging tasks for a wireless sensor network (WSN) is
   reducing energy waste to increase battery life. This paper examines a
   popular medium access control (MAC) protocol, i.e., sensor MAC (S-MAC)
   in the ns-2 network simulator, which has been frequently adopted as a
   performance benchmark in this field. This paper first proposes a new
   mechanism for proactive exchanging the status between sensor nodes to
   prevent unnecessary idle listening by a cross-layer approach that fully
   utilizes the information from the physical (PHY) layer. Because fatal
   bugs cause substantial performance degradation, the simulation results
   of the original module in ns-2 are strongly distorted. Another
   contribution of this paper is to develop a bug-fixedmodule. Several
   graphical illustrations are provided to demonstrate the operation of
   S-MAC and the effects of improper implementation. Major improvements are
   addressed in the main text and minor changes are provided in Appendix A.
   The simulation results show that the actual saturated throughput of
   S-MAC is approximately two times higher than that of the defect module
   in the case with bidirectional traffic. In addition, the proposed
   mechanism can save up to 47\% and 25\% of the energy for unidirectional
   and bidirectional traffic, respectively, in a line topology when the
   traffic is light.}},

   using scaling relation between magnitude and depth of hypocenter. The
   probability of tsunami generating is calculated by using the EEW

Abstract = {{In this study, a new copper(II) ion-imprinted polymer (Cu(II)-IIP) was

   the mixture of 0.1 M EDTA and 1 M HCl. The optimum pH for the adsorption
   of Cu(II) on to the polymer was 6. The selective performance of the
   polymer was compared to non-imprinted polymer (NIP) for the binary
   mixture Cu2+/Ni2+ and Cu2+/Zn2+. The relative selectivity of Cu(II)-IIP
   was 12.8 and 32.4 times greater than that of NIP as compared with the

Abstract = {{Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is considered to result from
   intrarenal vasoconstriction, and occurs more frequently in impaired than
   in normal kidneys. It was hypothesized that iodinated contrast media
   would markedly change renal blood flow and vascular resistance in
   functionally impaired kidneys. Thirty-six patients were enrolled (32
   men; mean age, 75.3 +/- 7.6 years) undergoing diagnostic coronary
   angiography and were divided into two groups based on the presence of
   chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated glomerular
   filtration rate (eGFR) of < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (CKD and non-CKD
   groups, n = 18 in both). Average peak velocity (APV) and renal artery
   resistance index (RI) were measured by Doppler flow wire before and
   after administration of the iodinated contrast media. The APV and the RI
   were positively and inversely correlated with the eGFR at baseline,
   respectively (APV, R = 0.545, P = 0.001; RI, R = -0.627, P < 0.001).
   Mean RI was significantly higher (P = 0.015) and APV was significantly
   lower (P = 0.026) in the CKD than in the non-CKD group. Both APV (P <
   0.001) and RI (P = 0.002) were significantly changed following contrast
   media administration in the non-CKD group, but not in the CKD group
   (APV, P = 0.258; RI, P = 0.707). Although renal arterial resistance was
   higher in patients with CKD, it was not affected by contrast media
   administration, suggesting that patients with CKD could have an
   attenuated response to contrast media.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a simple method to investigate the motion of a small
   particle in biopolymer solutions. Using optical tweezers with low
   stiffness, a trapped probe particle fluctuates widely for a long time
   along the light axis, which reflects the rheological properties of the
   surrounding environment. We present a convenient technique for
   three-dimensional position tracking and the analysis focused on the
   distribution of particle positions and its variance in a given time
   interval. It allows us to obtain useful information about the dynamics
   of a small particle in a wide range from a free diffusive motion to a
   constrained motion with statistical significance. We applied this method
   to investigate the dynamics in collagen and DNA solutions; it was found
   that a collagen solution behaves as a simple viscous liquid and a DNA
   solution has apparent elasticity due to the slow relaxation of the
   configuration of molecules. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Keratins, among other cytoskeletal intermediate filament proteins, are
   mutated at a highly conserved arginine with consequent severe disease
   phenotypes due to disruption of keratin filament organization. We
   screened a kinase inhibitor library, using A549 cells that are
   transduced with a lentivirus keratin 18 (K18) construct, to identify
   compounds that normalize filament disruption due to K18 Arg90Cys
   mutation at the conserved arginine. High-throughput screening showed
   that PKC412, a multikinase inhibitor, ameliorated K18 Arg90Cys-mediated
   keratin filament disruption in cells and in the livers of previously
   described transgenic mice that overexpress K18 Arg90Cys. Furthermore,
   PKC412 protected cultured A549 cells that express mutant or wild-type
   K18 and mouse livers of the K18 Arg90Cys-overexpressing transgenic mice
   from Fas-induced apoptosis. Proteomic analysis of proteins that
   associated with keratins after exposure of K18-expressing A549 cells to
   PKC412 showed that nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-IIA (NMHC-IIA)
   partitions with the keratin fraction. The nonmuscle myosin-IIA (NM-IIA)
   association with keratins was confirmed by immune staining and by
   coimmunoprecipitation. The keratin-myosin association is myosin
   dephosphorylation-dependent; occurs with K8, the obligate K18 partner;
   is enhanced by PKC412 in cells and mouse liver; and is blocked by
   hyperphosphorylation conditions in cultured cells and mouse liver.
   Furthermore, NMHC-IIA knockdown inhibits PKC412-mediated normalization
   of K18 R90C filaments. Conclusion: The inhibitor PKC412 normalizes K18
   Arg90Cys mutation-induced filament disruption and disorganization by
   enhancing keratin association with NM-IIA in a myosin
   dephosphorylation-regulated manner. Targeting of intermediate filament
   disorganization by compounds that alter keratin interaction with their
   associated proteins offers a potential novel therapeutic approach for
   keratin and possibly other intermediate filament protein-associated
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Viral outbreaks associated with swimming pools have been described
   worldwide. The objective of this study was to examine the extent of
   viral contamination in indoor and outdoor swimming pools.
   Methods and Results: Pools were examined for the presence of human
   enteric viruses (adenovirus, norovirus and enterovirus) and nonenteric
   viruses (papillomavirus and polyomavirus-BK, JC, KI, WU and Merkel
   cell). Bacteriological parameters were also evaluated. The analysed pool
   waters met microbiological quality standards. Enteric viruses were not
   detected. On the other hand, papillomaviruses (HPV8, 12, 23, 25, 120 and
   unclassified HPVs) and polyomaviruses (JC and Merkel cell
   polyomaviruses) were detected in 9/14 samples (64\%). The number of HPV
   DNA copies in pool waters, measured by quantitative Real-time PCR,
   ranged from 1.27E+04 to 1.13E+05/10L.
   Conclusion: Results show that a variety of nonenteric viruses may be
   discharged in pool waters by various secretions and excretions from
   infected individuals or asymptomatic carriers.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first report on human papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses in
   swimming pools. The likelihood that these viruses can be transmitted by
   recreational activities deserves to be explored in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECT Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) has become the first line
   of treatment in obstructive hydrocephalus. The Toronto group (Kulkarni
   et al.) developed the ETV Success Score (ETVSS) to predict the clinical
   response following ETV based on age, previous shunt, and cause of
   hydrocephalus in a pediatric population. However, the use of the ETVSS
   has not been validated for a population comprising adults. The objective
   of this study was to validate the ETVSS in a ``closed-skull{''}
   population, including patients 2 years of age and older.
   METHODS In this retrospective observational study, medical charts of all
   consecutive cases of ETV performed in two university hospitals were
   reviewed. The primary outcome, the success of ETV, was defined as the
   absence of reoperation or death attributable to hydrocephalus at 6
   months. The ETVSS was calculated for all patients. Discriminative
   properties along with calibration of the ETVSS were established for the
   study population. The secondary outcome is the reoperation-free
   survival. ``
   RESULTS This study included 168 primary ETVs. The mean age was 40 years
   (range 3-85 years). ETV was successful at 6 months in 126 patients
   (75\%) compared with a mean ETVSS of 82.4\%. The area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve was 0.61, revealing insufficient
   discrimination from the ETVSS in this population. In contrast,
   calibration of the ETVSS was excellent (calibration slope = 1.01),
   although the expected low numbers were obtained for scores <70. Decision
   curve analyses demonstrate that ETVSS is marginally beneficial in
   clinical decision-making, a reduction of 4 and 2 avoidable ETVs per 100
   cases if the threshold used on the ETVSS is set at 70 and 60,
   respectively. However, the use of the ETVSS showed inferior net benefit
   when compared with the strategy of not recommending ETV at all as a
   surgical option for thresholds set at 80 and 90.
   In this cohort, neither age nor previous shunt were significantly
   associated with unsuccessful ETV. However, better outcomes were achieved
   in patients with aqueductal stenosis, tectal compressions, and other
   tumor-associated hydrocephalus than in cases secondary to
   myelomeningocele, infection, or hemorrhage (p = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS The ETVSS did not show adequate discrimination but
   demonstrated excellent calibration in this population of patients 2
   years and older. According to decision-curve analyses, the ETVSS is
   marginally useful in clinical scenarios in which 60\% or 70\% success
   rates are the thresholds for preferring ETV to CSF shunt. Previous
   history of CSF shunt and age were not associated with worse outcomes,
   whereas Posthemorrhagic and postinfectious causes of the hydrocephalus
   were significantly associated with reduced success rated following ETV.}},

Title = {{The tectonic significance of the Early Cretaceous forearc-metamorphic

Abstract = {{A complex array of faulted arc rocks and variably metamorphosed forearc
   accretionary complex rocks form a mappable arc-forearc boundary in
   southern Alaska known as the Border Ranges fault (BRF). We use detrital
   U-Pb zircon dating of metasedimentary rocks within the Knik River
   terrane in the western Chugach Mountains to show that a belt of Early
   Cretaceous amphibolite-facies metamorphic rocks along the BRF was formed
   when older melange rocks of the Chugach accretionary complex were
   reworked in a sinistral-oblique thrust reactivation of the BRF during a
   period of forearc plutonism. The metamorphic subterrane of the Knik
   River terrane has a maximum depositional age (MDA) of 156.5 +/- 1.5 Ma
   and a detrital zircon age spectrum that is indistinguishable from the
   Potter Creek assemblage of the Chugach accretionary complex, supporting
   correlation of these units. These ages contrast strongly with new and
   existing data that show Triassic to earliest Jurassic detrital zircon
   ages from metamorphic screens in the plutonic subterrane of the Knik
   River terrane, a fragmented Early Jurassic plutonic assemblage generally
   interpreted as the basement of the Peninsular terrane. Based on these
   findings, we propose the following new terminology for the Knik River
   terrane: (1) ``Carpenter Creek metamorphic complex{''} for the Early
   Cretaceous ``metamorphic subterrane{''}, (2) ``western Chugach
   trondhjemite suite{''} for the Early Cretaceous forearc plutons within
   the belt, (3) ``Friday Creek assemblage{''} for a transitional melange
   unit that contains blocks of the Carpenter Creek complex in a
   chert-argillite matrix, and (4) ``Knik River metamorphic complex{''} in
   reference to metamorphic rocks engulfed by Early Jurassic plutons of the
   Peninsular terrane that represent the roots of the Talkeetna arc. The
   correlation of the Carpenter Creek metamorphic complex with the Chugach
   melange indicates that the trace of the BRF lies similar to 1-5 km north
   of the map trace shown on geologic maps, although, like other segments
   of the BRF, this boundary is blurred by local complexities within the
   BRF system. Ductile deformation of the melange is sufficiently intense
   that few vestiges of its original melange fabric exist, suggesting the
   scarcity of rocks described as melange in the cores of many orogens may
   result from misidentification of rocks that have been intensely
   overprinted by younger, ductile deformation.}},

   repolarization}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{High-frequency action potential (AP) transmission is essential for rapid
   information processing in the central nervous system. Voltage-dependent
   K(v)3 channels play an important role in this process thanks to their
   high activation threshold and fast closure kinetics, which reduce the
   neuron's refractory period. However, premature Kv3 channel closure leads
   to incomplete membrane repolarization, preventing sustainable AP
   propagation. Here, we demonstrate that K(v)3.1b channels solve this
   problem by producing resurgent K+ currents during repolarization, thus
   ensuring enough repolarizing power to terminate each AP. Unlike
   previously described resurgent Na+ and K+ currents, K(v)3.1b's resurgent
   current does not originate from recovery of channel block or
   inactivation but results from a unique combination of steep
   voltage-dependent gating kinetics and ultra-fast voltage-sensor
   relaxation. These distinct properties are readily transferrable onto an
   orthologue K-v channel by transplanting the voltage-sensor's S3-S4 loop,
   providing molecular insights into the mechanism by which K(v)3 channels
   contribute to high-frequency AP transmission.}},

Abstract = {{What do you do when faced with wrongdoing-do you blame or do you
   forgive? Especially when confronted with offences that lie on the more
   severe end of the spectrum and cause terrible psychological or physical
   trauma or death, nothing can feel more natural than blame. Indeed, in
   the UK and the USA, increasingly vehement and righteous public
   expressions of blame and calls for vengeance have become commonplace;
   correspondingly, contemporary penal philosophy has witnessed a
   resurgence of the retributive tradition, in the modern form usually
   known as the `justice' model. On the other hand, people can and
   routinely do forgive others, even in cases of severe crime. Evolutionary
   psychologists argue that both vengeance and forgiveness are universal
   human adaptations that have evolved as alternative responses to
   exploitation, and, crucially, strategies for reducing risk of
   re-offending. We are naturally endowed with both capacities: to blame
   and retaliate, or to forgive and seek to repair relations. Which should
   we choose? Drawing on evolutionary psychology, we offer an account of
   forgiveness and argue that the choice to blame, and not to forgive, is
   inconsistent with the political values of a broadly liberal society and
   can be instrumentally counterproductive to reducing the risk of future
   re-offending. We then sketch the shape of penal philosophy and criminal
   justice policy and practice with forgiveness in place as a guiding
   ideal.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims: Subclinical thyroid conditions, defined by normal
   thyroxin (T4) but abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, may
   be associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk. More recently, TSH
   levels within the normal range have been suggested to be associated with
   metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk. This work studies the
   linearity of the relationship between metabolic syndrome and TSH across
   the euthyroid range.
   Methods and results: We studied 3533 male participants of the Aragon
   Workers' Health Study (AWHS) with normal TSH and free T4 levels, across
   quintiles of these variables, after adjusting for age, alcohol intake,
   and smoking. Compared with the lowest TSH quintile, the odds ratios for
   metabolic syndrome at the higher quintiles, which indicate lower thyroid
   function, were 1.34 (1.04, 1.73), 1.56 (1.21, 2.01), 1.57 (1.22, 2.03),
   and 1.71 (1.32, 2.21). The lowest free T4 quintile also showed an odds
   ratio of 1.49 (1.16, 1.90) with respect to the highest quintile. In
   addition, spline models showed departures from linearity: the risk of
   metabolic syndrome mostly increases at TSH values below the median
   (sample half-closest to subclinical hyperthyroidism). Interestingly,
   glucose also increases with TSH primarily below the median TSH,
   diastolic blood pressure shows similar changes across the entire TSH
   range, whereas body mass index, triglycerides, and high-density
   lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol change only at the highest normal TSH
   values, which are associated with lower free T4 concentration.
   Conclusions: TSH and free T4 within the normal range are associated with
   the metabolic syndrome. The sample half-below the TSH median (with
   probably higher functional thyroid status) exhibited better metabolic
   and cardiovascular profiles. (C) 2015 The Italian Society of

Abstract = {{Introduction: Brachial blood pressure increases with exercise and an
   excessive rise predicts increased cardiovascular risk. Measurement of
   brachial blood pressure alone may exaggerate the true blood pressure
   elevation due to exercise-induced change to pressure amplification.
   Whether blood pressure-lowering treatment modulates pressure
   amplification during exercise is unknown.
   Methods: Thirty-two participants with stage 1-2 hypertension (mean age
   59.2 years) received eight weeks' blood pressure lowering with either
   aliskiren (300mg, n=16) or valsartan (320mg, n=16). Brachial and central
   aortic pressure (CASP) were measured non-invasively during treadmill
   exercise (Bruce protocol) at baseline, after eight weeks' treatment and
   48 hours following treatment withdrawal.
   Results: The rise in brachial blood pressure with exercise exceeded the
   rise in CASP, indicative of enhanced pressure amplification. Eight
   weeks' treatment elicited similar reductions in brachial blood pressure
   and CASP which did not differ between rest and peak exercise (p>0.05).
   The exercise-induced increase in systolic pressure amplification did not
   differ between baseline and following eight weeks' treatment (p>0.05).
   These effects remained unchanged following treatment withdrawal.
   Conclusion: Blood pressure lowering does not directly influence the
   relationship between aortic and brachial pressure either at rest or
   during exercise in patients with hypertension, other than through
   proportionate lowering of both pressures. These effects remained
   unchanged 48 hours after a simulated missed medication dose.}},

Journal = {{EJNMMI PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the absence of CT or traditional transmission sources in
   combined clinical positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance
   (PET/MR) systems, MR images are used for MR-based attenuation correction
   (MR-AC). The susceptibility effects due to metal implants challenge
   MR-AC in the neck region of patients with dental implants. The purpose
   of this study was to assess the frequency and magnitude of subsequent
   PET image distortions following MR-AC.
   Methods: A total of 148 PET/MR patients with clear visual signal voids
   on the attenuation map in the dental region were included in this study.
   Patients were injected with {[}F-18]-FDG, {[}C-11]-PiB, {[}F-18]-FET, or
   {[}Cu-64]-DOTATATE. The PET/MR data were acquired over a single-bed
   position of 25.8 cm covering the head and neck. MR-AC was based on
   either standard MR-ACDIXON or MR-ACINPAINTED where the
   susceptibility-induced signal voids were substituted with soft tissue
   information. Our inpainting algorithm delineates the outer contour of
   signal voids breaching the anatomical volume using the
   non-attenuation-corrected PET image and classifies the inner air regions
   based on an aligned template of likely dental artifact areas. The
   reconstructed PET images were evaluated visually and quantitatively
   using regions of interests in reference regions. The volume of the
   artifacts and the computed relative differences in mean and max
   standardized uptake value (SUV) between the two PET images are reported.
   Results: The MR-based volume of the susceptibility-induced signal voids
   on the MR-AC attenuation maps was between 1.6 and 520.8 mL. The
   corresponding/resulting bias of the reconstructed tracer distribution
   was localized mainly in the area of the signal void. The mean and
   maximum SUVs averaged across all patients increased after inpainting by
   52\% (+/- 11\%) and 28\% (+/- 11\%), respectively, in the corrected
   region. SUV underestimation decreased with the distance to the signal
   void and correlated with the volume of the susceptibility artifact on
   the MR-AC attenuation map.
   Conclusions: Metallic dental work may cause severe MR signal voids. The
   resulting PET/MR artifacts may exceed the actual volume of the dental
   fillings. The subsequent bias in PET is severe in regions in and near
   the signal voids and may affect the conspicuity of lesions in the
   mandibular region.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The aim of this study was to investigate possible effects that
   participation in sports, exercise, and recreation may have on
   self-esteem and quality-of-life in service members/veterans with
   disabilities.
   Design Two hundred twenty service members/veterans with disabilities who
   were participants in one of three annual adaptive sporting events took
   part in this cross-sectional study. Variables of interest were years of
   sport, exercise, and recreation participation since the onset of
   disability as well as the type of activity they engaged in. Main outcome
   measures were self-esteem and quality-of-life.
   Results A positive relationship was found between participant
   quality-of-life and the number of years spent participating in sports,
   exercise, and recreation since the onset of their disability. A
   significant difference was found between pre-event and postevent
   self-esteem scores. A significant difference was also found in
   self-esteem scores between the levels of years of participation in
   sports, exercise, and recreation when averaged across activity type.
   Finally, there were significant differences found on self-esteem scores
   between the levels of type of activity averaged across years of
   participation.
   Conclusions Our results indicate that participation in sports, exercise,
   and recreation has a positive influence on self-esteem and
   quality-of-life in individuals with disabilities.}},

Title = {{Hantavirus infection-induced thrombocytopenia triggers increased

Abstract = {{Introduction: We evaluated the mechanisms of thrombocytopenia
   encountered in hantavirus disease by studying platelet production
   together with platelet aggregation and deposition to collagen surface.
   Patients and methods: The study group consisted of 31 prospectively
   recruited, consecutive, hospitalized patients having acute Puumala
   hantavirus infection. Blood samples were collected acutely and at the
   control visit and subjected to analysis in Sysmex (R) XE-5000 to capture
   mean platelet volume (MPV) and immature platelet fraction (IPF\%).
   Platelet aggregation under low shear rate conditions was assessed with
   impedance aggregometry Multiplate (R), where as platelet function
   analyzer (PFA)-100 (R) was applied under blood flow of high shear
   forces.
   Results: IPF\% was 3.1-fold higher acutely compared with the control
   (median 7.4\%, range 2.0-23.8\% vs. median 2.4\%, range 1.4\%-5.2\%, p <
   0.001) tightly associating with the low platelet count (r = -0.76, p <
   0.001). Accordingly, acute MPV was high (median 11.4 fl, range 9.4-13.1
   fl vs. median 10.5 fl, range 9.0-12.0 fl, p = 0.003). Acute platelet
   aggregation in Multiplate (R) was decreased to all agonists compared
   with the later control (p < 0.05 for all agonists). Aggregation capacity
   associated with thrombocytopenia (for all agonists r >= 0.81, p <
   0.001), but impaired aggregation occurred also among patients with a
   nearly normal platelet count. Triggered by collagen, 20\% of values were
   below reference range, while 73\% of responses were low with thrombin
   receptor activating peptide. Significantly, under high shear platelet
   deposition to collagen surface was normal despite thrombocytopenia.
   Conclusions: During acute hantavirus disease, platelet aggregation is
   impaired especially when induced with thrombin. Platelet adhesive
   mechanisms on collagen are intact despite thrombocytopenia while
   thrombopoiesis is active. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We use consumer panel data to calculate the damage suffered by German
   consumers due to a detergent cartel that was active between 2002 and
   2005 in eight European countries. Applying before-and-after and
   difference-in-differences estimations we find average overcharges
   between 6.7 percent and 6.9 percent and an overall consumer damage of
   about 13.2 million euros over the period from July 2004 until March
   2005. Under the assumption that the cartel-induced share on turnover is
   representative for the entire cartel period and for all affected
   markets, the overall consumer damage would even sum up to about 315
   million euros. Our results further suggest that the retailers reacted to
   the price increases of the cartel firms via price increases for their
   own detergent products, resulting in significant umbrella effects. We
   quantify the damage due to this umbrella pricing to a total of about
   7.34 million euros. With respect to the discussion whether special
   procedures for bringing collective actions should be available in the
   EU, our results are important in that we show how consumer associations
   can use consumer panel data in order to claim damages before national
   courts and thereby actively fulfill their mandate of consumer
   protection.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic flow behavior and velocity correlation in a bidirectional two
   lanes road are studied using Cellular Automata (CA) model within a
   mixture of fast and slow vehicles. The behaviors of the Inter-lane and
   Intra-lane Velocity Correlation Coefficients (V.C.C.) due to the
   interactions between vehicles in the same lane and the opposite lane as
   a function of the density are investigated. It is shown that high
   densities in one lane lead to large cluster in the second one, which
   decreases the Intra-lane velocity correlations and thereby form clusters
   in the opposite lane. Moreover, we have found that there is a critical
   density over which the Inter-lane V.C.C. occurs, but below which no
   Inter-lane V.C.C. happens. The spatiotemporal diagrams correspond to
   those regions are derived numerically. Furthermore, the effect of the
   overtaking probability in one lane on the Intra-lane V.C.C. in the other
   lane is also investigated. It is shown that the decrease of the
   overtaking probability in one lane decreases slightly the Intra-lane
   V.C.C. at intermediate density regimes in the other lane, which improves
   the current, as well as the Inter-lane V.C.C. decreases. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Objective: The Veterans Affairs Open Versus Endovascular Repair (OVER)
   Trial of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms study was a randomized controlled
   trial comparing open vs endovascular repair (EVAR) in standard-risk
   patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms. The analysis reported here
   identifies characteristics, risk factors, and long-term outcome of
   endoleaks in patients treated with EVAR in the OVER cohort.
   Methods: The OVER trial enrolled 881 patients, of whom 439 received
   successful EVAR. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify
   predictors for endoleaks and secondary interventions. Kaplan-Meier
   survival analysis, longitudinal plots, and generalized linear mixed
   models methods were used to describe time to endoleak detection,
   resolution, or death.
   Results: During a mean follow-up of 6.2 +/- 2.4 years, 135 patients
   (30.5\%) developed 187 endoleaks. Four patients with EVAR went on to
   rupture; these four patients did not all have an endoleak. Mortality
   between patients who did and did not develop endoleaks was not
   significantly different. The 187 endoleaks included 12\% type I, 76\%
   type II, 3\% type III, 3\% type IV, and 6\% indeterminate. Patient
   demographics and vascular risk factors were not associated with endoleak
   development. The presence of endoleaks resulted in an increase in
   aneurysm diameter over time (P <.0001). Fifty-three percent of endoleaks
   resolved spontaneously, and 31.9\% received secondary interventions. The
   initial aneurysm size independently predicted a need for secondary
   interventions (P <.0003). Delayed type II endoleaks (detected > 1 year
   after EVAR) were associated with aneurysm enlargement compared with the
   early counterpart. There was no difference in aneurysm size or length of
   survival between type II and other types of endoleak.
   Conclusions: We present one of the most comprehensive and longest
   follow-up analyses of patients treated with aortic endografts. Endoleaks
   were common and negatively affected aneurysm diameter reduction. Delayed
   type II endoleaks were associated with late aneurysm diameter
   enlargement. Endoleaks and aneurysm diameter enlargement were not
   associated with excess mortality compared with those without these
   features.}},

Abstract = {{Transgenic crops have become a staple in modern agriculture, and are
   typically characterized using a variety of molecular techniques
   involving proteomics and metabolomics. Characterization of the transgene
   insertion site is of great interest, as disruptions, deletions, and

   identification of these regions and their integrity is required for
   regulatory agencies. Here, we present CONTRAILS (Characterization of
   Transgene Insertion Locations with Sequencing), a straightforward, rapid
   and reproducible method for the identification of transgene insertion
   sites in highly complex and repetitive genomes using low coverage
   paired-end Illumina sequencing and traditional PCR. This pipeline
   requires little to no troubleshooting and is not restricted to any
   genome type, allowing use for many molecular applications. Using whole
   genome sequencing of in-house transgenic Glycine max, a legume with a
   highly repetitive and complex genome, we used CONTRAILS to successfully
   identify the location of a single T-DNA insertion to single base

Title = {{The capacity for volitional control of pharyngeal swallowing in healthy
   adults}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{152}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Previous research has documented that pressure and
   duration of brainstem-generated pharyngeal swallowing can be cortically
   modulated. But there is a commonly held belief that the sequence of
   pharyngeal pressure remains constant. However, Huckabee et al. {[}19]
   reported a patient cohort who demonstrated reduced latency of peak
   pressure in the proximal and distal pharynx, disproportionate and
   sometimes inversely correlated with overall swallowing duration,
   suggesting independent timing of underlying muscle contraction within
   the overall pharyngeal response. This study examined if healthy adults
   can volitionally produce altered latency of pharyngeal closure in
   isolation following intensive training, thereby evaluating the capacity
   for pharyngeal adaptation in a healthy system.
   Method: Six healthy participants were seen for intensive-training,
   consisting of daily one-hour sessions over two weeks (10 days) using
   pharyngeal manometry as a visual biofeedback modality. The participants
   were instructed to produce simultaneous pressure in the pharyngeal
   sensors when swallowing. The temporal separation of peak proximal and
   distal pharyngeal pressure was measured with discrete-sensor pharyngeal
   manometry at baseline, during training with biofeedback, and following
   training without biofeedback.
   Results: Following intensive training, participants were able to reduce
   temporal separation of peak pressure between the proximal and distal
   pharyngeal sensors from a baseline median of 188 ms (IQR = 231 ms) to 68
   ms (IQR = 92 ms; p = 0.002). In contrast, there was no significant
   change in overall swallowing duration during training (p = 0.41).
   However, change in pharyngeal pressure latency was moderately correlated
   with both change in swallowing duration (r = 0.444) and amplitude (r =
   0.571) during training, and there was a reduction in swallowing duration
   post-training (p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: Given intensive manometric biofeedback training,
   participants substantially reduced temporal separation of peak proidmal
   and distal pharyngeal pressure when volitionally swallowing. However,
   correlation with overall pressure and duration measures suggest the
   adaptation was one of modulating the cumulative pharyngeal response
   rather than altering discrete components of timing of pharyngeal
   pressure in isolation. This is inconsistent with the pattern of
   behaviour documented by Huckabee et al. {[}19] in the patient
   population. Further research on modulatory control over targeted aspects
   of the pharyngeal swallow is needed, and may provide avenues for
   rehabilitative treatment of patients with dysphagia. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Based on ethnographic research, archival data, and a catalog of protest
   events, this article analyzes the relationship between popular social
   movements, business mobilization, and institutional politics in
   Argentina during the post-neoliberal phase, which arguably began circa
   2003. How did waves of popular mobilization in the 1990s shape business
   mobilization in the 2000s? How did contentious politics influence
   institutional politics in the post-neoliberal period? What are the
   changes and continuities of the agrarian boom that cut across the
   neoliberal and post-neoliberal periods? While I zoom in on Argentina,
   the article goes beyond this case by contributing to three discussions.
   First, rather than limiting the analysis to the customary focus on the
   mobilization of subordinated actors, it examines the demobilization of
   popular social movements, the mobilization of business sectors, and the
   connections between the two. Second, it shows the ways in which the
   state can simultaneously challenge neoliberal principles while also
   favoring the global corporations that dominate the contemporary
   neoliberal food regime. Finally, the case of Argentina sheds light on
   the political economy of the ``Left turn{''} in Latin America,
   particularly the negative socio-environmental impacts of commodity
   booms. The article concludes that researchers need to pay closer
   attention to the connections between contentious and institutional
   politics, and to the protean possibilities of neoliberalism to inspire
   collective actions.}},

Abstract = {{Protein-RNA networks are ubiquitous and central in biological control.
   We present an approach termed RNA Tagging that enables the user to

   protein of interest is fused to an enzyme that adds uridines to the end
   of RNA. RNA targets bound by the chimeric protein in vivo are covalently
   marked with uridines and subsequently identified from extracted RNA via
   high-throughput sequencing. We used this approach to identify hundreds
   of RNAs bound by a Saccharomyces cerevisiae PUF protein, Puf3p. The
   results showed that although RNA-binding proteins productively bind
   specific RNAs to control their function, they also `sample' RNAs without
   exerting a regulatory effect. We used the method to uncover hundreds of
   new and likely regulated targets for a protein without canonical
   RNA-binding domains, Bfr1p. RNA Tagging is well suited to detect and

   technique to the social golfer problem and we also use it to break
   symmetries of the problem. Our technique is simpler, more expressive,

   automatically generate contain less clauses than improved direct
   instances such as in Triska and Musliu (Ann Oper Res 194(1):427-438,

Abstract = {{This study empirically developed a theoretical model of army wives'
   resilience amid deployment. A sample of 18 women, representing army
   bases in Southern and Western parts of the United States, were
   interviewed about their experience of spousal wartime deployment.
   Through the use of grounded theory methods, findings revealed that
   stress unfolds across the deployment cycle. Adaptation in response to
   stress was found to occur through the dynamic engagement of resilience
   processes across individual (e.g., acculturation, purpose/meaning,
   emotional expression), family (e.g., communication, role flexibility,
   emotion regulation, problem solving, and coconstructing meaning), and
   sociocultural (e.g., information, belongingness, shared beliefs,
   practical support) levels. Implications for clinical training,
   assessment, prevention, intervention, and future research in couples and

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The development of BCR/ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) over the
   past 20 years has dramatically improved the outcomes for patients with
   every stage of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid
   leukemia (CML). Clinicians now have access to 5 oral, generally
   well-tolerated, and highly effective TKIs. How should these agents be
   used for an individual patient to ensure the best possible duration and
   quality-of-life, to avoid treatment-related complications, and
   potentially to achieve a cure at an affordable cost? Because CML
   patients may need to continue TKI therapy indefinitely, the long-term
   safety of each treatment option must be considered. Evidence-based care
   requires an understanding of the optimal use of these drugs, their
   specific early and late toxicities, the prognostic significance of
   achieving treatment milestones, and the critical importance of molecular
   monitoring. Efficacy is important, but treatment choice does not depend
   only on efficacy. Choosing among various treatment options is informed
   by understanding the distinct benefits and risks of each agent, along
   with careful consideration of patient-specific factors, such as risk
   status, age, and comorbidities.}},

   with added converter lime}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{259}},
Pages = {{271-278}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A field-trial with different application rates of converter lime (0.2,
   0.7 and 1.0 kg m(-2)) was set up in a pine forest stand in southern
   Sweden in 1984. The lime contained 14.6 g kg(-1) vanadium. The aim with
   this study was to evaluate the vanadium concentration and speciation in
   the soil 26 years after application. Samples of the organic mar layer
   and the mineral soil were analyzed separately. The vanadium
   concentration decreased with soil depth, from 680 to 8 mg kg(-1) soil.
   Analysis by vanadium K-edge\}CANES spectroscopy showed that vanadium(IV)
   was the predominant species in the mar layer. Further, iron and/or
   aluminum (hydr)oxides were important sorbents for vanadium(V) in the
   mineral soil. The spedation of dissolved vanadium, as determined by
   HPLC-ICP-MS, was dominated by vanadium(V), which is considered the most
   toxic vanadium species. However, the vanadium sorption capacity of the
   soil was sufficient to reduce the total bioavailable vanadium below
   phytotoxic levels. By combining two different vanadium spedation
   methods, this study was able to conclude that vanadium speciation in
   soils is governed by soil properties such as pH, organic matter content
   and the content of metal (hydr)oxides, but not by the vanadium species
   added to the soil. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Yields as expressed in terms of Grain Number (GN) in cereals are closely
   related to the length of the Emergence-Heading period (EH) and the
   prevailing environmental conditions. The present work investigates the
   effects of increasing photoperiod, temperature and thermal amplitude on
   EH duration and GN in durum wheat. Used data related to cv Karim, grown
   under no limiting water and nutrient conditions in three Tunisian sites:
   Tunis (16 dates), Kef (8 dates) and Mornag (5 dates). GN varied from
   17200 to 800 grains m(-2) when EH range was 117-32 days, for November
   and July sowings, respectively. For conventional sowing and under higher
   temperatures wheat reached heading faster with EH interval reduction
   around 12 days each 1 degrees C rise during the phenophase. The modified
   photothermal unit (MPTU) gave the best predictive phenological results
   for both conventional and unconventional sowing dates. Results showed
   the possible substitution of rise in photoperiod effect by rate of
   rising in temperature in field conditions. GN was found to be correlated
   to maximum temperatures adjusted by thermal amplitude logarithm. The
   latter can express the intensity of thermal stress and can be used as a
   satisfactory predictor of attainable wheat yields in conditions with no
   water and nutrient limitation and in Mediterranean environments.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. Professional cycling is considered one of the most demanding of all
   endurance sports. The three major professional cycling stages races
   (i.e. Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana) require
   cyclists to compete daily covering between similar to 150-200 km for
   three consecutive weeks. Anecdotal evidence indicates that such an event
   has a significant effect on the sleep, mood, and general well-being of
   cyclists, particularly during the latter stages of the event. The
   primary aim of this study was to simulate a grand tour and determine the
   impact a grand tour has on the sleep, mood, and general well-being of
   competitive cyclists.
   Methods. Twenty-one male cyclists (M +/- SD, age 22.2 +/- 2.7 years)
   were examined for 39 days across three phases (i.e. baseline, simulated
   grand tour, and recovery). Sleep was assessed using sleep diaries and
   wrist activity monitors. Mood and general well-being were assessed using
   the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) and Visual Analogue Scales (VAS).
   Results. The amount and quality of sleep as assessed by the wrist
   activity monitors declined during the simulated grand tour. In contrast,
   self-reported sleep quality improved throughout the study. Cyclists'
   mood and general well-being as indicated by vigour, motivation, physical
   and mental state declined during the simulated tour.
   Conclusion. Future investigations should examine sleep, mood and
   well-being during an actual grand tour. Such data could prove
   instrumental toward understanding the sleep and psychological changes
   that occur during a grand tour.}},

Abstract = {{A 7-yr-old male captive American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus)
   presented with a 2-wk history of an enlarged, ulcerated nuptial pad on
   the mediopalmar surface of the first digit of the left carpus. A 3-mm
   wedge biopsy of the mass was not diagnostic and differentials included
   an epidermal inclusion cyst or squamous cell carcinoma. No fungal or
   acid-fast organisms were cultured or noted on impression smear. Wide
   surgical resection of the mass and associated first digit were
   performed. Histopathology confirmed squamous cell carcinoma associated
   with the dermal nuptial gland with neoplastic cells extending close to
   deep surgical margins. Two months after surgery, no recurrence was
   noted. Although experimental tumor studies in amphibians are well
   documented, clinical reports of cutaneous neoplasia management in
   captive amphibians are scarce. Squamous cell carcinoma should be
   considered as a differential diagnosis when male anurans present with
   nuptial gland enlargement.}},

Abstract = {{Pyelonephritis, a common complication of urinary tract infections, is
   frequently associated with kidney scarring and may lead to end-stage
   renal disease. During bacterial infections inflammatory and coagulation
   pathways and their mutual interaction are playing pivotal roles in the
   host response. Given that thrombomodulin (TM) is crucially involved in
   the interplay between coagulation and inflammation, we aimed to
   investigate the roles of its EGF and lectin-like domains in inflammation
   during acute pyelonephritis. Indeed, the EGF-like and the lectin-like
   domains of TM, are especially known to orchestrate inflammation and
   coagulation in different ways. Acute pyelonephritis was induced by
   intravesical inoculation of 1 x 10(8) CFU of uropathogenic Escherichia
   coli in two strains of TM transgenic mice. TMpro/pro mice carry a
   mutation in the EGF-like domain making them unable to activate protein
   C, an anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory protein. TMLeD/LeD mice lack
   the lectin-like domain of TM, which is critical for its
   anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. Mice were sacrificed 24
   and 48 h after inoculation. Bacterial loads, the immune response and the
   activation of coagulation were evaluated in the kidney and the bladder.
   TMLeD/LeD mice showed elevated bacterial load in bladder and kidneys
   compared to WT mice, whereas TMpro/pro had similar bacterial load as WT
   mice. TMLeD/LeD mice displayed a reduced local production of
   pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil renal infiltration. Activation
   of coagulation was comparable in TMLeD/LeD and WT mice. From these data,
   we conclude that the lectin-like domain of thrombomodulin is critically
   involved in host defence against E. coli induced acute pyelonephritis.

Abstract = {{Converging empirical data suggests that a set of largely consistent
   personality traits exist in both human and nonhuman primates; despite
   these similarities, almost nothing is known concerning the
   neurobiological basis of these traits in nonhuman primates. The current
   study examined associations between chimpanzee personality traits and
   the grey matter volume and asymmetry of various frontal cortex regions
   in 107 captive chimpanzees. Chimpanzees rated as higher on Openness and
   Extraversion had greater bilateral greymatter volumes in the anterior
   cingulate cortex. Further, chimpanzee rated as higher on Dominance had
   larger grey volumes in the left anterior cingulate cortex and right
   Prefrontal Cortex (PFC). Finally, apes rated higher on
   Reactivity/Unpredictability had higher grey matter volumes in the right
   mesial PFC. All associations survived after applying False Discovery
   Rate (FDR) thresholds. Results are discussed in terms of current
   neuroscientific models of personality which suggest that the frontal
   cortex, and asymmetries in this region, play an important role in the
   neurobiological foundation of broad dispositional traits. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The biomass supply chain is one of the most critical elements of
   large-scale bioenergy production and in many cases a key barrier for
   procuring initial funding for new developments on specific energy crops.
   Most productions rely on complex transforming chains linked to feed and
   food markets. The term `supply chain' covers various aspects from
   cultivation and harvesting of the biomass, to treatment, transportation,
   and storage. After energy conversion, the product must be delivered to
   final consumption, whether it is in the form of electricity, heat, or
   more tangible products, such as pellets and biofuels. Effective supply
   chains are of utmost importance for bioenergy production, as biomass
   tends to possess challenging seasonal production cycles and low mass,
   energy and bulk densities. Additionally, the demand for final products
   is often also dispersed, further complicating the supply chain. The goal
   of this paper is to introduce key components of biomass supply chains,
   examples of related modeling applications, and if/how they address
   aspects related to environmental metrics and management. The paper will
   introduce a concept of integrated supply systems for sustainable biomass
   trade and the factors influencing the bioenergy supply chain landscape,
   including models that can be used to investigate the factors. The paper
   will also cover various aspects of transportation logistics, ranging
   from alternative modal and multi-modal alternatives to introduction of
   support tools for transportation analysis. Finally gaps and challenges
   in supply chain research are identified and used to outline research
   recommendations for the future direction in this area of study.}},

Abstract = {{We refer to the hypotheses that for an absolutely irreducible
   representation of a compact Lie group there exists at least one subgroup
   with an odd dimensional fixed point space as the Ize conjecture (IC). If
   the IC is true, then it follows that loss of stability through an
   absolutely irreducible representation of a compact Lie group leads to
   bifurcation of steady states. Lauterbach and Matthews have shown that
   the (IC) is in general not true and have constructed three infinite
   families of finite subgroups of which act absolutely irreducibly on and
   have no odd dimensional fixed point space. They also have shown that in
   spite of this failure of the (IC) the nontrivial isotropy types are
   generically symmetry breaking at least for the groups in two of these
   three families. In this paper we show a similar bifurcation result for
   the third family defined by Lauterbach and Matthews. We go on and
   construct a family of groups acting absolutely irreducibly on which have
   only even dimensional fixed point spaces. Then we discuss the steady
   state bifurcations in this case. Key ingredients are an abstract group
   theoretic construction and a kind of inductive step reducing the issue
   of bifurcations to a problem in . We end this paper with a discussion on
   how to extend the results by Lauterbach and Matthews to larger sets of
   groups which act on and . In this context we point out, that the
   inductive step, which is important for our arguments, does not work in
   general and this gives rise to interesting new questions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents evidence of the first detection of interstellar dust
   in ice age polar ice. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) results are
   reported for 15 elements found in dust filtered from eight samples of
   Camp Century Greenland ice dating from 40 to 78 kyrs BP. High
   concentrations of Sn, Sb, Au, Ag, Ir, and Ni were found to be present in
   three out of these eight samples. One compositionally anomalous dust
   sample from an ice core depth of 1230.5 m (age similar to 49 kyrs BP,
   near the beginning of D/O stadial No. 13) was found to contain tin with
   an average weight percent of 49\% as determined by energy dispersive
   X-ray analysis (EDS). This sample was also found to contain high
   concentrations of Pb with an average weight abundance of 8.4\% and
   matching the Sn:Pb ratio observed in interstellar spectra. Dust
   particles in this sample generally have a platy morphology and range
   from submicron size up to a size as large as 120 mu m, a particle
   consisting almost entirely of SnO2 and being the largest monomineralic
   extraterrestrial dust particle so far discovered. One porous aggregate
   tin-bearing particle was found to contain nanometer sized chondrules
   indicating an extraterrestrial origin. The extraterrestrial origin for
   the tin is also indicated by the presence of isotopic anomalies in the
   114(Sn), Sn-115 and Sn-117 isotopes. Follow up isotopic measurements of
   this tin-rich dust need to be performed to improve confidence in the
   anomalies reported here. High abundances of the low melting point
   elements Ag, Au, and Sb are also present in this tin-rich sample along
   with elevated abundances of the siderophiles Ir, Ni, Fe, and Co, the
   latter being present in chondritic proportions and indicating that about
   9\% of the dust has a Cl chondrite component. Measurements indicate that
   about 97\% of this dust is of extraterrestrial origin with a 3\%
   residual being composed of terrestrial windblown dust. EDS analysis of
   another tin-rich Camp Century ice core dust sample dating to similar to
   130 kyrs BP was found to contain tin-rich particles with a similar platy
   morphology and to have Sn and Pb weight abundances averaging 39\% and
   7.5\% respectively, again approximating the interstellar Sn:Pb ratio.
   The relative absence of cosmic microspheres and the unmelted appearance
   of the tin-rich particles in both of these samples suggests that these
   particles entered the Earth's atmosphere at low velocity, implicating a
   gradual accumulation of dust from a dispersed state in the near Earth
   space environment. The unusual enhancement of Sn and Pb could be
   explained if these dust particles were originally present in the solar
   system's interstellar environment in a superconducting native metal
   state and were preferentially concentrated through Meissner effect
   forces by the passage of cosmic ray driven hydromagnetic shocks which
   may also have transported them into the solar system. The 49 kyrs BP
   event is estimated to have lasted over 6 years and to have deposited
   dust onto the Earth at a rate 10(4)-10(5) times higher than present
   rates. This had a significant cooling effect on climate and resulted in
   a transient 33 fold increase in snow accumulation. Future discovery of
   these events in ice cores at other locations should void any lingering
   thoughts that this heavy metal enhancement may be due to sample
   contamination. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Despite the ongoing decrease in the incidence of gastric
   cancer, this disease is still a major cause of death. It is stilt
   debatable whether D2 lymphadenectomy improves survival and whether this
   procedure should be performed routinely or selectively.
   Objectives: To compare the pathological and short-term results following
   radical D2-type gastric resection and lymphadenectomy versus the more
   limited D1 type resection and lymphadenectomy.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on 4 years experience
   treating 164 patients suffering from gastric cancer. We compared the
   results between the group of patients who underwent a radical D2 type
   gastric resection and lymphadenectomy (n=100) and those of a relatively
   small group of patients who intentionally underwent the more limited D1
   type (n=34).
   Results: The overall number of harvested lymph nodes was 9 4 in the D1
   group compared to 30 12 (range 16-69) in the D2 group (P = 0.001). Of
   the 100 patients undergoing a D2 lymphadenectomy, 57\% had positive
   nodes compared to 38\% of the 34 patients in the D1 group (P = 0.045).
   Conclusions: We showed statistically significant differences between D1
   and D2 procedures in the overall number of harvested lymph nodes and the
   proportion of positive nodes to the overall number. Our results support
   the fact that D2 resection should be recommended as the standard
   approach of treatment for gastric cancer patients, ensuring a larger
   number of retrieved lymph nodes and a comparable rate of complications
   and mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Exercise is beneficial for people with rheumatoid arthritis
   (RA). However, patients and health professionals have expressed concern
   about the possible detrimental effects of exercise on joint health. The
   present study investigated the acute and chronic effects of
   high-intensity, low-impact aerobic and resistance exercise on markers of
   large joint health in RA.
   Methods: Eight RA patients and eight healthy, matched control (CTL)
   participants performed 30 minutes' high-intensity, low-impact aerobic
   and lower-body resistance exercise, one week apart. Primary outcome
   measures assessing joint health were serum cartilage oligomeric matrix
   protein (sCOMP) and knee joint synovial inflammation (Doppler ultrasound
   colour fraction; CF). These measures were taken at baseline, immediately
   after and 0.5, one, two, six and 24 hours post-exercise. In a separate
   study, nine RA patients completed eight weeks of progressive exercise
   training. The same outcome measures were reassessed at baseline, and at
   one hour post-exercise of training weeks 0, 1, 4 and 8.
   Results: RA patients showed higher overall sCOMP {[}RA: 1,347 +/- 421,
   CTL: 1,189 +/- 562 ng/mL; p < 0.05; effect size (ES) = 0.32] and CF when
   scanned longitudinally (RA: 0.489 +/- 0.30 x 10(-3), CTL: 0.101 +/- 0.13
   x 10(-3); p < 0.01; ES = 1.73) and transversely (RA: 0.938 +/- 0.69 x
   10(-3), CTL: 0.199 +/- 0.36 x 10(-3); p < 0.01; ES = 1.33) than CTL.
   However, no acute effects on joint health were observed post-exercise.
   Similarly, no chronic effects were observed over eight weeks of combined
   aerobic and resistance training in RA, with positive effects on physical
   fitness and function.
   Conclusions: RA patients on stable treatment with low disease activity
   were able to perform an individually prescribed high-intensity,
   low-impact aerobic and resistance exercise without changes in markers of
   large joint health. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   of members of Parliament. Tasked with interviewing justices prior to
   their appointment to the bench, the committee met four times,
   interviewing only five of the eight judicial candidates appointed to the
   bench before the Conservative government announced the committee's
   termination in 2014. This study offers the first comprehensive analysis
   of the performance of this ad hoc judicial review committee. Using an
   original dataset, we find that MPs asked little by way of probing
   questions, such as those related to policy or a candidate's previous
   jurisprudence. However, we do find some evidence that the hearing
   process was used to further the political aims of the participating

Abstract = {{Approximately one-third of the global burden of tuberculosis (TB)
   remains undiagnosed each year and the vast majority of cases of
   multidrug-resistant TB remain undetected. Many countries still place
   heavy reliance on outdated technologies that are blunt and ineffective

   and newtechnologies have been developed and evaluated and are now being
   implemented. This review summarizes these developments and describes the
   currently available diagnostic tools. Consideration is given to the
   requirements of future diagnostic tests and how these should be
   evaluated not only with regard to their diagnostic accuracy and
   operational feasibility, but ultimately in terms of whether they impact

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship of
   intracranial pressure (ICP) with intensive care unit (ICU) length of
   stay in a large cohort of severe traumatic brain injury patients and
   identify factors associating with prolonged ICU course.
   Methods: This was a single-center database review of de-identified
   research data that had been prospectively collected; setting:
   neurosurgical ICU, Ben Taub General Hospital, Houston, TX.
   Results: In a cohort of 438 severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)
   patients, 149 (34\%) had a motor Glasgow Coma Scale score of 1 to 3 on
   admission and 284 (65\%) had 4 to 5. Intracranial pressure during the
   ICU course was 19.8 +/- 11.2 mm Hg. Favorable outcome was obtained in
   148 (34\%), and unfavorable, in 211 (48\%) patients with a mortality of
   28\%. ICU length of stay (LOS) was 19.4 +/- 13.9 days. Joint modeling of
   ICP and ICU LOS was undertaken, adjusted for the International Mission
   for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI admission
   prognostic indicators. A higher ICP was not significantly associated
   with longer ICU LOS (P = .4). However, presence of a mass lesion on
   admission head computed tomography was strongly correlated with a
   prolonged ICU LOS (P = .0007). Diffuse injuries with basal cistern
   compression or midline shift were marginally associated with a longer
   ICU LOS (P = .053).
   Conclusions: ICP, as monitored and managed according to BTF guidelines,
   is not associated with ICU length of stay. Patients with severe TBI and
   a mass lesion on admission head computed tomography were found to have
   prolonged ICU LOS independently of other indicators of injury severity
   and intracranial pressure course. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Demographic discrepancies in dental healthcare utilization and access to
   care have historically been studied and attributed to such factors as
   socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity. Such potential discrepancies
   and contributing factors amongst the Jewish population have been little
   explore. Objective: To examine the frequency of dental visits among
   Jewish subgroups and explored possible explanatory factors for
   differences in dental healthcare utilization, such as financial
   constraints, dental anxiety, religious perspectives on health, lack of
   perceived need, poor accessibility, and scheduling conflicts. Basic
   research design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: A religiously
   diverse non-clinical sample of 169 Jews completed measures on
   demographics, dental visit frequency, dental anxiety, and general
   religiousness. Results: On average, Orthodox Jews visit the dentist less
   often than non-Orthodox Jews (OR=0.43) and Ultra-Orthodox Jews markedly
   less (OR=0.23). Moreover, differences between these groups in dental
   visits were largely mediated by differences in dental anxiety, poor
   accessibility, lack of perceived need and scheduling conflicts.
   Conclusion: These results identify a population that is at risk for poor
   oral health and suggests possible preventive and corrective
   interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) allows the visualization of the cell
   architecture in its native state. We developed a robust solution to
   adapt cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) to a
   monolayer of adherent cells using a functionalized polyacrylamide
   hydrogel growing substrate. We applied this method to reconstitute an
   endothelial cell monolayer to visualize the morphology of adherens
   junctions (AJs) which regulate permeability and integrity of the
   vascular barrier. The fine morphology and ultrastructure of AJs from
   cultured primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were
   analyzed in their native state by using CEMOVIS. Doxycycline and
   sphingosine-l-phosphate (SIP) are known as efficient regulators of
   endothelial permeability. Doxycycline and SIP treatments both led to a
   drastic morphological switch from very uneven to standardized 14-17 nm
   wide AJs over several microns indicative of a better membrane tethering.
   Repetitive structures were occasionally noticed within the AJ cleft
   reflecting a local improved structural organization of VE-cadherin
   molecules. The ultrastructural stabilization of Ajs observed upon
   treatment likely indicates a better adhesion and thus provides
   structural clues on the mechanism by which these treatments improve the
   endothelial barrier function. This method was also successfully extended
   to a thick epithelial barrier model. We expect our strategy to extend
   the reliable application of CEMOVIS to virtually any adherent cultured
   cell systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{DIABETES RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aims: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes has increased
   rapidly in recent decades and this trend will continue as the global
   population ages. This study investigates the prevalence of, and factors
   associated with, diagnosed and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus and
   pre-diabetes in older adults in Ireland.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data from 5377 men and women aged 50 and over
   from Wave 1 of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) was
   analysed. Diagnosed diabetes was defined using self-reported doctors'
   diagnosis and medications data. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) analysis
   was used to identify undiagnosed and pre-diabetes. Age and sex-specific
   prevalence estimates were generated. Logistic regression was used to
   investigate the association between diabetes classification and the
   demographic, health and lifestyle characteristics of the population.
   Results: The prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes was
   8.6\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 7.6-9.5\%) and 0.9\% (95\% CI:
   0.6-1.1\%) respectively. Diabetes was more prevalent in men than women
   and increased with age. The prevalence of pre-diabetes was 5.5\% (95\%
   CI: 4.8-6.3\%) and increased with age. Diabetes and pre-diabetes were
   independently associated with male sex, central obesity and a history of
   hypertension, while undiagnosed diabetes was associated with geographic
   location and medical costs cover.
   Conclusion: Despite high rates of obesity and other undiagnosed health
   conditions, the prevalence of undiagnosed and pre-diabetes is relatively
   low in community-dwelling older adults in Ireland. Addressing lifestyle
   factors in this population may help to further reduce the prevalence of
   pre-diabetes and improve outcomes for those with a previous diagnosis.

Title = {{Systematic review of interventional sickle cell trials registered in

Journal = {{CLINICAL TRIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{575-583}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background/Aims: The registry ClinicalTrials.gov was created to provide
   investigators and patients an accessible database of relevant clinical
   trials.
   Methods: To understand the state of sickle cell disease clinical trials,
   a comprehensive review of all 174 closed, interventional sickle cell
   trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov was completed in January 2015.
   Results: The majority of registered sickle cell disease clinical trials
   listed an academic center as the primary sponsor and were an early phase
   trial. The primary outcome for sickle cell disease trials focused on
   pain (23\%), bone marrow transplant (BMT) (13\%), hydroxyurea (8\%),
   iron overload (8\%), and pulmonary hypertension (8\%). A total of 52
   trials were listed as terminated or withdrawn, including 25 (14\% of all
   trials) terminated for failure to enroll participants. At the time of
   this review, only 19 trials uploaded results and 29 trials uploaded a
   manuscript in the ClinicalTrials.gov database. A systematic review of
   pubmed.gov revealed that only 35\% of sickle cell studies completed
   prior to 2014 resulted in an identified manuscript. In comparison, of 80
   thalassemia trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, four acknowledged
   failure to enroll participants as a reason for trial termination or
   withdrawal, and 48 trials (60\%) completed prior to 2014 resulted in a
   currently identified manuscript.
   Conclusion: ClinicalTrials.gov can be an important database for
   investigators and patients with sickle cell disease to understand the
   current available research trials. To enhance the validity of the
   website, investigators must update their trial results and upload trial
   manuscripts into the database. This study, for the first time,
   quantifies outcomes of sickle cell disease trials and provides support
   to the belief that barriers exist to successful completion, publication,
   and dissemination of sickle cell trial results.}},

Abstract = {{The use of soft materials as substrate for neural probes aims at
   achieving better compliance with the surrounding neurons while
   maintaining minimal rejection. Many strategies have emerged to enable
   such probes to penetrate the cortex, among which the use of resorbable
   polymers. We performed several tests involving two resorbable polymers
   considered most promising: polyethylene glycol (PEG) and silk fibroin
   (SF) from Bombyx Mori silkworms. Our coating method provides a
   repeatable, uniform structure optimized for a stress-reduced insertion
   of a parylene-C neural probe. Standard compression tests as well as in
   vitro and in vivo insertion assessments show that both SF and PEG-coated
   probes are stiff enough to avoid the buckling effect during insertion in
   the cortex. However, with a buckling force of 300 mN and a mechanical
   holding in vitro of tens of minutes, we assess silk fibroin to be more
   reliable for practical handling. In vivo first try-outs in mouse brain
   showed neither buckling issues of the probe nor undesired alteration of
   the signal recording. Moreover, we evidenced two distinct time scales in
   the bioresorption of our polymer coatings: silk fibroin degrades itself
   in a matter of weeks and PEG dissolves itself within seconds in the
   presence of water. We then present a hybrid PEG and SF coating that
   could be used as a drug delivery system with different time scales to
   reduce both the acute and the chronic body reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, our data indicated that both cAMP and MAP kinase signaling
   play important roles in microalgal physiology as well as in lipid or
   carotenoid biosynthesis. In order to understand downstream genes of
   these signaling pathways, we employed proteomics approach. Both signal
   pathways were first altered with specific signaling inhibitors or
   modulators. Treatment of specific inhibitors changed microalgal size and
   increased lipid contents. With the microalgal cells after treatments of
   specific signaling inhibitor or modulators, we performed the proteomics
   analysis to identify downstream genes responsible for these phenotypes.
   Interestingly, multiple photosynthesis genes were identified,
   particularly proteins associated with PSII. Our data suggested that MAP
   kinase and cAMP signaling affect the photosynthesis, thereby leading to
   microalgal lipid or carotenoid biosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{High definition (HD) and ultra-high definition (UHD) digital TV require
   high-resolution images and lots of data transfers between processors and
   memory devices often become the bottleneck of the system. Video and
   image signal processing usually require blocks of square or rectangular
   shaped pixel data for signal processing. It requires frequent
   precharging and activating new rows, and results in extra latencies for
   reading and writing pixel data in memory devices. This paper proposes an
   efficient memory controller for video and image processing to reduce the
   latencies for reading and writing blocks of pixel data. The controller
   stores a frame of pixel data by distributing contiguous lines of pixel
   data to multiple banks in sequence. Its efficiency is enhanced more with
   an interface protocol such as AMBA AXI in which outstanding transactions
   are allowed. Memory controllers according to the proposed scheme are
   designed and the performance and the efficiency are compared with the
   previous works. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The present study aimed to investigate the clinical
   characteristics of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Korean adults
   according to body mass index (BMI) and to analyze the association with
   cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of data from the Korea
   National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2011. A
   total of 3,370 patients with T2DM were divided into categories according
   to BMI. We conducted a comparison of the T2DM patient population
   composition by BMI category between different countries. We investigated
   the prevalence of awareness, treatment, and target control of T2DM
   according to BMI.
   Results: Patients with T2DM had a higher BMI, and were more likely to
   have a history of CVD than healthy controls. For Korean adults with
   T2DM, 8\% had BMI = 30 kg/m(2). By contrast, the population of patients
   with T2DM and BMI = 30 kg/m(2) was 72\% in patients in the USA and 56\%
   in the UK. The rate of recognition, treatment, and control has worsened
   in parallel with increasing BMI. Even in patients with BMI 25 to 29.9
   kg/m(2), the prevalence of CVD or high risk factors for CVD was
   significantly higher than in patients with BMI 18.5 to 22.9 kg/m(2)
   (odds ratio, 2.07).
   Conclusion: Korean patients with T2DM had lower BMI than those in
   Western countries. Higher BMI was associated with lower awareness,
   treatment, and control of diabetes, and a positive association was
   observed between CVD or high risk factors for CVD and BMI, even for
   patients who were overweight but not obese.}},

Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{Indocyanine green (ICG) is a near-infrared optical dye approved by the
   Food and Drug Administration. ICG has been investigated as a
   simultaneous color and fluorescence-imaging tracer for the
   intraoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes, but its use has
   recently expanded to include application as a photosensitizer for the
   local photodynamic/thermal treatment of identified lymph node
   metastases. The current study was designed to develop an ICG-loaded
   nanoemulsion as an effective agent for both the diagnosis and treatment
   of lymph node metastases. Incorporating the cationic lipid stearylamine
   (SA) together with ICG in the shell of nanoemulsions did not affect the
   loaded ICG concentration, but changed the surface charge of
   nanoemulsions from a negative to a positive value and improved the
   physical stability of nanoemulsions. Loading ICG into SA-incorporated
   nanoemulsions more effectively blocked the aggregation and degradation
   of ICG compared to loading in SA-free nanoemulsions. SA incorporation
   also enhanced tumor cell uptake of ICG-loaded nanoemulsions, resulting
   in greater cell killing upon light irradiation. After subcutaneous
   injection into the footpad of mice, SA-incorporated nanoemulsions
   increased the concentration of ICG accumulated in popliteal lymph nodes
   to a greater extent than SA-free nanoemulsions without affecting the
   kinetics of lymph node uptake of nanoemulsions. These multiple
   beneficial effects of incorporating SA in nanoemulsions are likely
   attributable to the electrostatic interaction between anionic ICG and
   cationic SA, as well as the change in the nanoemulsion surface charge
   from negative to positive. Our findings indicate that SA-incorporated
   nanoemulsions are promising ICG carriers for combined diagnosis and
   treatment of lymph node metastases. (C)) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Preeclampsia and the risk of cardiovascular disease later in life - A

Journal = {{MIDWIFERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1127-1134}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the literature review was to explore and quantify
   the risks associated with preeclampsia (PET) and the incidence of
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) namely myocardial infarction and stroke in
   later life.
   Design: Four databases used were searched: Ovid Medline, maternal and
   child health, Google Scholar and CINAHL with limits on years
   (2003-current), English language and full text.
   Setting: Any studies that included preeclampsia during pregnancy and
   where long term follow-up data were collected.
   Participants: Studies with longitudinal follow-up, cohort studies,
   females aged 18 years or over and those that included preeclampsia at
   any gestation in pregnancy were included while randomised controlled
   trials, short follow-up (i.e. not longitudinal) and studies
   pre-pregnancy or postpartum (within 6 weeks of birth) were excluded.
   Findings: Seven studies with over 4.93 million participants were
   identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. These studies demonstrated
   that PET is a strong marker of future CVD and a history of PET
   significantly increases the risk of hypertension later in life and
   subsequently increases the risk of other cardiovascular events in
   particular ischemic heart disease and stroke (both fatal and non-fatal).
   Conclusion: Early identification of CVD risk factors is an important
   public health issue and there needs to be greater awareness of
   hypertension and PET in pregnancy by both healthcare professionals and
   pregnant women. Implications for practice: The evidence from the
   literature clearly demonstrates that PET is a risk factor for future CVD
   and the challenge will be to educate healthcare professionals in
   particular midwives, nurses, obstetricians and General Practitioners as
   well as the women with PET so that they can be involved in the long term
   management of CVD risk factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Threshold switching is a phenomenon where the resistivity of an
   insulating material changes and the insulator exhibits metallic
   behavior. This could be explained by phase transformation in oxide
   materials; however, this behavior is also seen in amorphous insulators.
   In this study, through an ex-situ experiment using transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), we proved that threshold switching of amorphous NbO2
   accompanies local crystallization. The change in I V characteristics
   after electroforming was examined by evaluating the concentration
   profile. Atom probe tomography (APT) combined with in-situ TEM probing
   technique was performed to understand the threshold switching in
   amorphous NbO2. The local crystallization in amorphous NbO2 was
   validated by the observed difference in time-of-flight (ToF) between
   amorphous and crystalline NbO2. We concluded that the slower ToF of
   amorphous NbO2 (a-NbO2) compared with crystalline NbO2 (a-NbO2) is due
   to the resistivity difference and trap-assisted recombination. (C) 2015

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim This pilot study evaluated the short-term benefits of a
   telemonitoring-supplemented focused diabetic education compared with
   education alone in participants with Type 2 diabetes who were fasting
   during Ramadan.
   Methods In this pilot mixed-method study, we identified 37 participants
   and randomly allocated them to either a telemonitoring group (n = 18) or
   a group receiving Ramadan-focused pre-education only (usual care; n =
   19). The telemonitoring group received goal-setting and personalized
   feedback.
   Results The telemonitoring group was less likely to experience
   hypoglycaemia than the usual care group (odds ratio: 0.1273; 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.0267-0.6059). No significant differences were
   noted in glycaemic control at the end of study. Participants viewed
   telemedicine as a more convenient alternative although technological
   barriers remain a concern.
   Conclusions The results of this study reinforce the need for monitoring
   as well as educational initiatives for Muslims with diabetes who fast
   during Ramadan. Telemonitoring offers an attractive option requiring
   further research. (Clinical Trial Registry No. NCT02189135)}},

Abstract = {{A comb copolymer consisting of hydrophobic
   poly(2-{[}3-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4-hydroxyphenyl] ethyl methacrylate)
   (PBEM) and hydrophilic poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (POEM) is
   synthesized via one-pot free radical polymerization. The PBEM-POEM comb
   copolymer is used as an agent to direct the structure toward one
   consisting of worm-like mesoporous TiO2 (WM-TiO2) films. The selective,
   preferential interaction between the titania precursor and the
   hydrophilic POEM chains is responsible for the formation of a
   well-organized worm-like mesostructure. The morphology of the WM-TiO2
   films is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic
   force microscopy (AFM). In particular, the effects of film thickness on
   the optical and electrochemical properties are systematically
   investigated. The introduction of the WM-TiO2 layer between the
   nanocrystalline TiO2 (NC-TiO2) layer and fluorine-doped tin oxide (PTO)
   glass results in increased transmittance of visible light due to an
   antireflective property, decreased interfacial resistance and suppressed
   charge recombination at the interfaces of NC-TiO2/FTO glass. As a
   result, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized
   solar cell (DSSC) with a polymer electrolyte is improved from 53\% to
   6.6\% at an optimum film thickness (310 nm). The obtained efficiency
   represents a higher efficiency for the N719-based DSSC with a
   solvent-free, polymer electrolyte. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Missed parathyroid adenoma (PTA) is the commonest cause of
   persistent hyperparathyroidism. Although many are subsequently found in
   well-described locations, some are found in unusual regions of the neck.
   This paper presents the combined experience of three large tertiary
   endocrine surgery centres with maldescended PTA (MD-PTA).
   Methods: Patients were recruited from the endocrine surgical databases
   of three tertiary endocrine surgery units. Patients with PTA found >1 cm
   above the superior thyroid pole or other cervical locations as a result
   of abnormal or incomplete descent were included for analysis.
   Results: MD-PTA was identified in 16 patients out of a total of 5241
   patients who had undergone parathyroidectomies in the 7-year study
   period (incidence 0.3\%). Seven (44\%) patients had minimally invasive
   parathyroidectomy, while nine (56\%) had bilateral neck exploration. The
   mean excised gland weight was 750 + 170 mg. Cure was achieved in all
   patients with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. The locations of MD-PTA
   in this study included submandibular triangle, retropharyngeal space,
   carotid sheath (at carotid bifurcation and intravagal), parapharyngeal
   space (superior to thyroid cartilage or superior thyroid pole) and
   cricothyroid space.
   Conclusions: Despite their rare occurrence, incompletely or abnormally
   descended PTAs can be encountered by any surgeon who performs
   parathyroidectomies. It is important to develop a strategy to
   systematically locate these glands. High cure rates can still be
   achieved with minimally invasive parathyroidectomy if confident
   preoperative localization is available. A sound knowledge of embryology
   and a thorough exploration also facilitate an overall high success rate
   with open exploration.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the effect of TiCl4 treatment on the refractive index of
   a nanoporous TiO2 film. A nanoparticulate TiO2 film prepared on a glass
   substrate was immersed in a TiCl4 aqueous solution. The subsequent
   reaction of TiCl4 with H2O produces TiO2 and thus modifies the density
   and the refractive index of the film. With increasing TiCl4
   concentration, the refractive index initially increased and then
   declined after being maximized (n = 2.02 at 633 nm) at 0.08 M
   concentration. A refractive index change as large as 0.45 could be
   obtained with the TiCl4 treatment, making it possible to achieve
   diffraction efficiency exceeding 80\% in a diffraction grating-embedded
   TiO2 film. For high TiCl4 concentrations of 0.32 M and 0.64 M, the
   refractive index remained nearly unchanged. This was attributed to the
   limited permeability of high-viscosity TiCl4 solutions into the
   nanoporous films. The measured pore size distributions were in good
   agreement with the results of a diffraction analysis and refractive
   index measurement. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{At a certain frequency, an air-bubble excited by an acoustic wave
   produces a destructive interference, which plays a vital role in
   mitigating propeller cavitation induced pressure fluctuations on ship's
   hulls. By taking advantage of the acoustically transparent nature of
   rubber material, previous effort proposed employing an inflatable
   air-balloon so that the destructive interference could be implemented
   without any energy consumption. For its verification in a full-scale
   ship, this paper presents sea-trial measurements with the following
   major contribution. To inflate the balloon to the design size, and to
   keep the volume constant despite draught changes, a parametric relation
   is proposed by a semi-analytical method incorporated with the ideal gas
   law. This scheme is exploited in the full-scale measurements to attain a
   noticeable hull vibration reduction of 65\% at the exciting frequency of
   interest. Finally, this simple device is expected to be an inexpensive
   alternative for resolving vibration issues that arise from propeller
   cavitation.

   regard to employment, once again, non-White men and women were
   significantly more likely to be unemployed or under employed (fewer than
   20 h per week). Asian-American men reported higher education levels, but
   fewer hours employed. All of the men consumed alcohol at high rates, but
   Asian-American men were arrested and convicted less often than other men
   for alcohol related offenses. A critical limitation to the study was the
   small of number of Asian-American women participants and therefore an
   inability to conduct specific statistical tests for this subgroup.
   Findings fill a gap in forensic research and practice regarding adult
   offenders of color.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic toroidal rotation in a tokamak can be driven by turbulent
   momentum transport due to neoclassical flow effects breaking a symmetry
   of turbulence. In this paper we categorize the contributions due to
   neoclassical effects to the turbulent momentum transport, and evaluate
   each contribution using gyrokinetic simulations. We find that the
   relative importance of each contribution changes with collisionality.
   For low collisionality, the dominant contributions come from
   neoclassical particle and parallel flows. For moderate collisionality,
   there are non-negligible contributions due to neoclassical poloidal
   electric field and poloidal gradients of density and temperature, which
   are not important for low collisionality.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Our study investigated the association of UCP1 -3826A/G and
   UCP3 -55C/T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with obesity and its
   related traits among multiethnic Malaysians.
   Participants: A total of 447 (225 males; 46 Malays, 339 ethnic Chinese,
   62 ethnic Indians; 111 obese) participated.
   Methods: Demographic and anthropometric data were collected, and
   genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction
   fragment length polymorphism.
   Results: The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) for UCP1 according to
   Malay/Chinese/Indian ethnicities were .61/.55/.52 and .32/.55/.38,
   respectively. UCP3 genotype and allele distribution was significantly
   associated with ethnicity and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), but among
   non-obese and Chinese participants only, respectively, after stratified
   analysis. Chinese participants with T allele had significantly lesser
   risk to be centrally obese {[}odds ratio = .69 (CI = .48, 1.00; P =
   .04)], and also had significantly lower WHR compared to those with C
   allele. The UCP1 or UCP3 SNPs were not associated with obesity/BMI and
   total body fat (TBF), but combinatory genotype analysis revealed that
   those having the AA and CC genotype for the former and latter SNPs had
   significantly highest BMI and TBF compared to other genotype
   combinations.
   Conclusions: UCP3 -55C/T SNP was associated with central obesity among
   Malaysian participants of Chinese descent. Combinatory genotype analysis
   showed that BMI and TBF were significantly different among UCP1 -3826A/G
   and UCP3 -55C/T genotype combinations, suggesting the existence of a

Abstract = {{Objective: Despite an increase in the number of Japanese patients with
   pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, long-term outcomes and prognostic
   factors, especially for those with advanced disease, remain unclear.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 78 patients
   with unresectable pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms treated at our
   hospital from January 1987 to March 2015. Survival analyses were
   performed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Prognostic significance of several
   clinicopathological factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate
   analyses using a Cox regression model.
   Results: Median overall survivals of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (n
   = 64) and pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (n = 14) were 83.7 and 9.1
   months, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.02, 95\% confidence interval:
   0.01-0.08, P < 0.001). Although no significant differences were observed
   using a Ki-67 cut-off value of 2\% (hazard ratio: 0.46, 95\% confidence
   interval: 0.16-1.13, P = 0.0989), a Ki-67 cut-off of 10\% was a
   significant predictor in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
   (hazard ratio: 9.95, 95\% confidence interval, 3.01-32.97, P < 0.001).
   Treatment after the advent of targeted therapy (hazard ratio: 0.07, 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.03-0.19, P < 0.001) and the presence of bone
   metastases (hazard ratio: 4.38, 95\% confidence interval: 1.42-11.29, P
   = 0.013) were significant prognostic factors in patients with pancreatic
   neuroendocrine tumor evaluated by univariate analysis. Multivariate
   analysis also revealed that a Ki-67 index = 10\% (hazard ratio: 38.8,
   95\% confidence interval: 8.42-226.62, P < 0.001), approval of targeted
   therapy (hazard ratio: 0.02, 95\% confidence interval: 0.00-0.11, P <
   0.001) and bone metastases (hazard ratio: 5.56, 95\% confidence
   interval: 1.10-24.00, P = 0.039) were independent prognostic factors.
   Conclusions: We elucidated the long-term outcomes and prognostic factors

Abstract = {{A micro hole is a basic feature in micro manufacturing. Micro electrical
   discharge machining (EDM) is one of the key techniques for machining
   micro holes in metallic materials. Since debris is accumulated in the
   discharging gap between the tool electrode and the workpiece, it becomes
   increasingly very difficult to machine a micro hole as the chosen
   diameter is progressively decreased or the depth increased. The use of
   vibration in micro EDM drilling can improve machining efficiency by
   refreshing dielectric fluids and flushing out the debris from the gap.
   Although ultrasonic vibration over a few kHz has been introduced in many
   applications of micro EDM, it is difficult to apply to a workpiece of a
   very large size or mass. In this study, the effect of very-low-frequency
   vibration was investigated to improve the efficiency of micro EDM.
   Low-frequency vibration in the range of 10 to 70 Hz was applied to
   single-hole machining, to reverse EDM, and to multiple-hole machining.
   The machining efficiency was investigated while varying the vibration
   frequency and amplitude.}},

Abstract = {{A significant focus of hydrothermal vent ecological studies has been to
   understand how species cope with various stressors through physiological
   tolerance and biochemical resistance. Yet, the environmental conditions
   experienced by vent species have not been well characterized. This
   objective requires continuous observations over time intervals that can
   capture environmental variability at scales that are relevant to
   animals. We used autonomous temperature logger arrays (four roughly
   parallel linear arrays of 12 loggers spaced every 10-12 cm) to study
   spatial and temporal variations in the thermal regime experienced by
   hydrothermal vent macrofauna at a diffuse flow vent. Hourly temperatures
   were recorded over eight months from 2010 to 2011 at Grotto vent in the
   Main Endeavour vent field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, a focus area of the
   Ocean Networks Canada cabled observatory. The conspicuous animal
   assemblages in video footage contained Ridgeia piscesae tubeworms,
   gastropods (primarily Lepetodrilus fucensis), and polychaetes (polynoid
   scaleworms and the palm worm Paralvinella palmiformis). Two dimensional
   spatial gradients in temperature were generally stable over the
   deployment period. The average temperature recorded by all arrays, and
   in some individual loggers, revealed distinctive fluctuations in
   temperature that often corresponded with the tidal cycle. We postulate
   that this may be related to changes in bottom currents or fluctuations
   in vent discharge. A marked transient temperature increase lasting over
   a period of days was observed in April 2011. While the distributions and
   behavior of Juan de Fuca Ridge vent invertebrates may be partially
   constrained by environmental temperature and temperature tolerance,
   except for the one transient high-temperature event, observed fluid
   temperatures were generally similar to the thermal preferences for some
   species, and typically well below lethal temperatures for all species.
   Average temperatures of the four arrays ranged from 4.1 to 11.0 degrees
   C during the deployment, indicating that on an hourly timescale the
   temperature conditions in this tubeworm community were fairly moderate
   and stable. The generality of these findings and behavioral responses of
   vent organisms to predictable rhythmicity and non-periodic temperature
   shifts are areas for further investigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by using a ``top-down{''} approach

   voltage by using the results of cyclic voltammetry. The EPD process was
   monitored during the deposition times by using real-time
   chronoamperometery. The deposited GO films showed over 80\%
   transmittance at 550 nm in spite of the composite structure consisting
   of porous particles and 2-D sheets. We prepared GO-based composite
   structures as counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells. From
   the results of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the electron
   transfer in the composite counter electrode was better than that of the
   graphite or the platinum. Also, the energy conversion efficiency was
   enhanced to 6.02\% by using the suggested GO counter electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we showed that recombinant ice-binding protein
   (rLeIBP) from Arctic yeast Glaciozyma sp. prolonged the shelf-life of
   Korean beef by delaying lipid peroxidation and microbial growth rates
   during cold storage when it was embrocated in Korean beef before
   freezing. In addition, glutathione (GSH) and the antioxidant enzyme
   activities including catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST),
   glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were higher
   in the rLeIBP treated Korean beef samples than the control group
   containing no rLeIBP. These results indicate that the rLeIBP may be used
   to treat beef prior to refrigeration, since rLeIBP was shown to retard
   microbial growth rates as well as lipid peroxidation and improve the
   antioxidant enzyme activities of beef during cold storage. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The coral mucus may harbor commensal bacteria that inhibit growth of
   pathogens. Therefore, there is a need to understand the dynamics of
   bacterial communities between the coral mucus and tissues. Nubbins of
   Acropora muricata were subjected to increasing water temperatures of 26
   degrees C-33 degrees C, to simultaneously explore the bacterial
   diversity in coral mucus and tissues by 16S rRNA gene amplicon
   sequencing. Photochemical efficiency of symbiotic dinoflagellates within
   the corals declined above 31 degrees C. Both the mucus and tissues of
   healthy A. muricata were dominated by gamma-Proteobacteria, but under
   thermal stress there was a shift towards bacteria from the
   Verrucomicrobiaceae and alpha-Proteobacteria. Members of Cyanobacteria,
   Flavobacteria and Sphingobacteria also become more prominent at higher
   temperatures. The relative abundance of Vibrio spp. in the coral mucus
   increased at 29 degrees C, but at 31 degrees C, there was a drop in the
   relative abundance of Vibrio spp. in the mucus, with a reciprocal
   increase in the tissues. On the other hand, during bleaching, the
   relative abundance of Endozoicomonas spp. decreased in the tissues with
   a reciprocal increase in the mucus. This is the first systematic
   experiment that shows the potential for a bacterial community shift
   between the coral surface mucus and tissues in a thermally stressed
   coral.}},

   severe pruning (50\% removed)] and 2) winter pruning (conventional
   pruning) + summer pruning date (June 20, July 20, and August 20). The
   number of buds was highest (894.6) with conventional winter pruning
   (CWP) + summer pruning (SP) on July 20, followed by conventional pruning
   (CP) (784.4), then no pruning (NP) (712.2), severe winter pruning (SWP)

   (333.4). In general, the improvement in light penetration to the canopy,
   shaping of bearing shoots, and strengthened cane were observed in the
   treatment of winter pruning combined with summer pruning on July 20. In
   the following year, total yields were highest with NP (1,648 g),

Abstract = {{Introduction The management of pediatric poisoning is dependent on the
   type of toxicant ingested; however, little information has been
   published regarding the difference in poisoning by pharmaceuticals and
   nonpharmaceuticals in children. We compared the accidental poisoning of
   children younger than 3 years who had ingested pharmaceuticals or
   nonpharmaceuticals using emergency medical information center data.
   Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of the poisonings of
   children younger than 3 years who were evaluated by the Seoul Emergency
   Medical Information Center in 2011. The demographic data and detailed
   information regarding the poisonings were investigated. The substances
   that caused the poisonings were divided into the following 2 groups:
   pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceuticals, and their characteristics and
   the differences between the 2 types of poisonings were investigated.
   Results A total of 1279 cases were collected, most of which involved
   children who were 13 to 24 months old. Boys (51.3\%) were involved more
   than girls. Exposure to nonpharmaceuticals (60.7\%) was more common than
   exposure to pharmaceuticals. Personal care products and respiratory
   agents were the most commonly implicated substances. There were several
   significant differences between the pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical
   groups. Poisoning by pharmaceuticals occurred more frequently in older
   children and more frequently at night. Although the exact exposure of
   the children in the pharmaceutical group was known and they required
   more treatment in the emergency department, they were not given extra
   immediate first aid than the children in the nonpharmaceutical group.
   Conclusions Because there were several significant differences in the
   characteristics of accidental pediatric poisonings between the
   pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical groups, preventive strategies and
   educational programs should be implemented on the basis of the causative
   agent.}},

Abstract = {{Atypia/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) is a
   new category in the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology
   (BSRTC) for which repeat fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is

   ultrasonography and clinical predictors of malignancy in a subset of
   thyroid nodules associated with cytology diagnoses of AUS/FLUS.
   Between January 2011 and December 2102, 5440 patients underwent thyroid
   surgery at our institution. Of these, 213 patients were diagnosed
   AUS/FLUS at the preoperative cytopathology diagnosis. The frequency of
   FNAC and ultrasonography images was compared between patients with
   cancerous and benign tumors based on their final pathology.
   Of the 213 patients, 158 (74.2\%) were diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma
   in their final pathology reports. In univariate and multivariate
   analyses, the frequency of FNAC was not significantly correlated with
   the cancer diagnosis. Hypoechogenicity (odds ratio 2.521, P = 0.007) and
   microcalcification (odds ratio 3.247, P = 0.005) were statistically
   correlated with cancer risk.
   Although AUS/FLUS in cytopathology is recommended for repeating FNAC in
   BSRTC, we proposed that thyroid nodules with ultrasonography findings
   that suggest the possibility of cancer should undergo thyroidectomy with
   diagnostic intent.}},

Abstract = {{High purity CVD-SiC, considered as a nuclear grade cladding material,
   exhibits thermal shock tolerance similar to 1260 degrees C in room
   temperature water and beyond it (>1260 degrees C) in saturated water.
   Being thinner than the tested specimen thickness (1.5 mm x 2.0 mm), the
   actual cladding (0.57 mm) is anticipated to exhibit enhanced thermal
   shock tolerance. This implies that thermal shock alone may not shatter
   the SiC cladding in reflood. Level of fuel rod internal pressure will be
   a decisive factor in predicting cladding fracture during reflood.
   Decreasing water subcooling significantly reduces thermal shock fracture
   danger of ceramic materials. Thermal shock experiments showed strength
   retention for both pressureless sintered-SiC and CVD SiC, as well as
   Al2O3 samples quenched from temperatures up to 1260 degrees C in
   saturated water. Solid-liquid contacts during nucleate and transition
   boiling, and boiling incipience upon water bath entering are a highly
   probable origin of thermal shock fracture in water quenching. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to predict descriptive texture
   characteristics of cooked rice with a texture analyzer using a full
   predictive model (partial least square regression; PLSR) and an
   optimized predictive model (jackknife resampling method; JRM). Texture
   profiles of 102 cooked rice samples were measured using a spectral
   stress strain analysis. Eleven sensory texture characteristics were
   evaluated using a trained descriptive panel. The JRM showed slightly
   better prediction for sensory texture attributes than PLSR due to the
   removal of insignificant variables. The following three sensory
   attributes were strongly predicted by JRM based on the calibration model
   correlation coefficient (Real): cohesion of bolus (Rcal = 0.78),
   adhesion to lips (Rcal = 0.83), and hardness (Rcal = 0.72).
   Cohesiveness, toothpull and toothpack were moderately predicted (Rcal >=
   0.60). The results from the texture analyzer were able to estimate
   sensory texture attributes, which were directly related to texture
   characteristics such as hardness, stickiness and cohesiveness.}},

   Utilization Rate for DSRC-Based Sensor Nodes in ITS Applications}},
Journal = {{IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{Dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) plays an important role in
   sensor networking for intelligent transportation system applications.
   How to achieve a higher hardware efficiency becomes an attractive issue
   to design each critical building bock in sensor node. DSRC standards
   usually adopt either FM0 code or Manchester code as a coding technique
   to enhance signal reliability. In this paper, a fully reused VLSI
   architecture of FM0/Manchester codec with a hardware utilization rate
   (HUR) of 100\% is proposed for DSRC-based sensor node. It is based on
   the half-cycle processing model (HCPM). The HCPM includes three core
   techniques: 1) half-cycle logic partition; 2) reused-based retiming; and
   3) Boolean function reshaping. The HCPM can improve the HUR of
   FM0/Manchester codec from 27.33\% to 100\% with the reduction of the
   transistor count from 86 to 66. A 100\% HUR means every transistor is
   activated; therefore, a more power is consumed. With a design tradeoff
   between HUR and power consumption, this paper still presents a higher
   energy efficiency. This paper is realized in TSMC 0.18-mu m 1P6M CMOS
   technology. The silicon area of core circuit is 33 x 120 mu m(2). The
   experiment results demonstrate that this paper presents a competitive
   performance with 100\% HUR compared with the existing works. With this
   paper, DSRC-based sensor nodes can present a 100\% HUR FM0/Manchester
   codec, fully supporting DSRC standards of Europe, USA, and Japan.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{Elevated nutrient levels can lead to excessive biofilm growth, but
   reducing nutrient pollution is often challenging. There is therefore
   interest in developing control measures for biofilm growth in
   nutrient-rich rivers that could act as complement to direct reductions
   in nutrient load. Shading of rivers is one option that can mitigate
   blooms, but few studies have experimentally examined the differences in
   biofilm communities grown under shaded and unshaded conditions. We
   investigated the assembly and diversity of biofilm communities using in
   situ mesocosms within the River Thames (UK). Biofilm composition was
   surveyed by 454 sequencing of 16S amplicons (similar to 400 bp length
   covering regions V6/V7). The results confirm the importance of sunlight
   for biofilm community assembly; a resource that was utilized by a
   relatively small number of dominant taxa, leading to significantly less
   diversity than in shaded communities. These differences between unshaded
   and shaded treatments were either because of differences in resource
   utilization or loss of diatom-structures as habitats for bacteria. We
   observed more co-occurrence patterns and network interactions in the
   shaded communities. This lends further support to the proposal that
   increased river shading can help mitigate the effects from macronutrient
   pollution in rivers.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes the development of the wages of male foreign workers
   from all important sending countries across time using longitudinal
   employment register data. A cohort analysis of the individuals entering
   the German labor market in the years 1999 to 2001 indicates that the raw
   wage gap of migrants compared to native Germans decreases by 14 log
   percentage points in the first eight years. The results of a
   decomposition method based on fixed effects regression models give
   evidence that this wage adjustment is mostly due to time-varying
   observable characteristics. Selective return migration, and the trend
   effects play no role for the aggregate. We find that wage assimilation
   happens mainly through three channels: first, through the accumulation
   of firm-specific human capital, which explains approximately 40 percent;
   second, search gains are approximately the same order of magnitude; and
   third, the accumulation of general human capital explains one-fifth of
   the assimilation. We further demonstrate that the importance of these
   channels differs substantially by the origin groups.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim was to provide information regarding oral and
   maxillofacial (OMF) lesions in an older Taiwanese population.
   Background: The rate of increase of older people in Taiwan is expected
   to be rapid. OMF lesions are very frequent in the older population, but
   no studies have been performed on these lesions in Taiwan.
   Materials and methods: OMF cases (between 2000 and 2011) in geriatric
   patients (>= 60 years of age) with records of age, sex and histological
   diagnoses were retrieved from the Oral Pathology Department of our
   institution. These lesions were classified into four main categories:
   tumour/tumour-like reactive lesions, cystic/pseudocystic lesions,
   inflammatory/infective lesions and other miscellaneous lesions.
   Results: Six thousand seven hundred and twenty-six lesions were
   collected from a total of 39 503 OMF lesions in older Taiwanese patients
   in this study. Most of these lesions were distributed in the
   inflammatory/infective group, followed by tumour/tumour-like reactive
   lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common lesion, and,
   additionally, there was a high frequency of oral potentially malignant
   disorders.
   Conclusions: The present study showed trends similar to previous reports
   from other countries. However, some detailed information was different,
   perhaps due to the different criteria and different geographic
   distribution. Worthy of note, our results indicated that screening for
   oral potentially malignant disorder and oral malignancy in the older
   population is essential.}},

Abstract = {{Designing island models is a challenging task for researchers. A number
   of decisions is required regarding the structure of the islands, how

   Cluster geometry optimization is a widely known and complex problem that
   provides a set of hard instances to assess and test optimization
   algorithms. The analysis presented in this paper reveals how design
   options for island models impact search effectiveness and population
   diversity, when seeking for the global optima of short-ranged Morse
   clusters. These outcomes support the definition of a robust and scalable

Abstract = {{Intact development of cerebellar connectivity is essential for healthy
   neuromotor and neurocognitive development. To date, limited knowledge
   about the microstructural properties of the cerebellar peduncles, the
   major white matter tracts of the cerebellum, is available for children
   and adolescents. Such information would be useful as a comparison for
   studies of normal development, clinical conditions, or associations of
   cerebellar structures with cognitive and motor functions. The goal of
   the present study was to evaluate the variability in diffusion measures
   of the cerebellar peduncles within individuals and within a normative
   sample of healthy children. Participants were 19 healthy children and
   adolescents, aged 9-17 years, mean age 13.0 +/- 2.3. We analyzed
   diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data with deterministic
   tractography. We generated tract profiles for each of the cerebellar
   peduncles by extracting four diffusion properties (fractional anisotropy
   (FA) and mean, radial, and axial diffusivity) at 30 equidistant points
   along each tract. We were able to identify the middle cerebellar
   peduncle and the bilateral inferior and superior cerebellar peduncles in
   all participants. The results showed that within each of the peduncles,
   the diffusion properties varied along the trajectory of the tracts.
   However, the tracts showed consistent patterns of variation across
   individuals; the coefficient of variation for FA across individual
   profiles was low (a parts per thousand currency sign20 \%) for each
   tract. We observed no systematic variation of the diffusion properties
   with age. These cerebellar tract profiles of the cerebellar peduncles
   can serve as a reference for future studies of children across the age
   range and for children and adolescents with clinical conditions that
   affect the cerebellum.}},

Title = {{THE PROBLEM OF SHARING NUCLEAR RESPONSIBILITY IN NATO DURING THE
   PRESIDENCY OF LYNDON JOHNSON}},
Journal = {{TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL}},

Pages = {{108-116}},

Abstract = {{This article examines different ways of sharing nuclear responsibility
   in NATO between the US and its European allies that were considered by
   the Johnson Administration. It is built on analysis of American
   diplomatic documents. The USSR's launching of Sputnik in 1957 shifted
   the nuclear balance between the two superpowers. Together with the
   elaboration of a new strategy of ``flexible response{''} by the US, it
   caused serious doubts in the countries of Western Europe about the
   reliability of American nuclear guarantees to their security. These
   doubts forced the European members of NATO to demand more participation
   in decision-making on nuclear matters in the Alliance and to develop
   their own nuclear forces as a supplement to the US nuclear deterrent. To
   lessen these fears and to stop the process of nuclear proliferation, the
   US administration proposed sharing nuclear responsibility with its
   European allies through the creation of the Multilateral Force (MLF).
   American policymakers considered the MLF a tool to strengthen the
   defense of Western Europe and at the same time to preserve American
   control over the launching of nuclear missiles. Additionally, it would
   give West Germany a reasonable level of participation in the management
   of NATO's nuclear weapons. Despite considerable Allied efforts to reach
   a consensus, the MLF project was developing very slowly. Although West
   Germany joined with the US in favor of the MLF, the project did not
   enjoy widespread support among the other members of NATO. Eventually,
   the Johnson Administration abandoned the MLF project because of lack of
   support in Europe, criticisms in the US Congress, and the priority of
   signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that demanded
   cooperation with the USSR. Instead of the MLF, Secretary of Defense
   McNamara proposed the creation of a Select Committee of Defense
   Ministers to consider expanded Allied participation in nuclear planning.
   McNamara's proposal met with membership approval (except for the French)
   at a meeting of the NATO Permanent Representatives in June 1965.
   Progress in discussions on nuclear matters slowed as France provoked a
   crisis within the European Economic Community that developed in parallel
   with frequent French statements about reorganization of the Alliance
   with the aim of bringing forces and installations in France under French
   command and freeing French forces from NATO control. The Select
   Committee, however, was not affected and held its first formal meeting
   on November 27, 1965. At that meeting, several working groups were
   established, including one on nuclear planning. Paradoxically, France's
   withdrawal of its military from NATO in 1966 made it easier for NATO to
   adopt a decision about creation of a permanent mechanism for
   consultations on nuclear matters in the Alliance. In December 1966, the
   Nuclear Defense Affairs Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group were
   established, and they began to function on a permanent basis in 1967.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to identify the potential for cultivation of
   Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Scenedesmus abundans in raw and autoclaved
   domestic wastewater (sewage) for nutrient removal, in a batch process.
   The growth was observed by measuring chlorophyll content. The inoculum
   size of 10\% and 20\% was used and the growth of microalgae and nutrient
   removal was monitored on daily basis. The maximum removal of ammonium
   nitrogen, phosphate and nitrates by Chlorella pyrenoidosa in raw samples
   was observed as 99\%, 96\% and 80\%, respectively, whereas the maximum
   removal of ammonium nitrogen, phosphate and nitrates by Scenedesmus
   abundans in raw samples was observed as 98\%, 95\% and 83\%,
   respectively. The maximum chlorophyll content was observed as 11.33 mg/l
   and 7.23 mg/l for C. pyrenoidosa and S. abundans, respectively, in raw
   samples. The experimental results reveal that both the microalgae are
   capable to grow and remove the nutrients from domestic wastewater. (C)

Abstract = {{Background Work and sleep patterns for commercial motor vehicle (CMV)
   drivers often include long working hours, shift work and diminished
   sleep duration and quality, which have been linked to overweight,
   obesity and other problems. Aims To explore possible connections between
   work, sleep and obesity among CMV drivers.
   Methods Survey and anthropometric data were collected from male
   long-haul CMV drivers in central North Carolina, USA, over a period of 6
   months. Drivers' body mass index (BMI) was used as a measure of total
   body obesity and sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) as a measure of
   central adiposity.
   Results Among the 260 study subjects, mean BMI was 33.1 (64\% were obese
   or morbidly obese) and mean SAD was 32.3 cm, classifying 89\% of drivers
   as being at high or very high cardiometabolic risk. About 83\% of
   drivers worked an irregular daily schedule, 64\% worked irregular total
   daily hours, 32\% worked irregular days of the week and 46\% reported
   getting <7 h of sleep during work nights. Significant predictors of BMI
   included the number of hours worked daily (P < 0.05) and the age (P <
   0.01) of the driver, while age was also a significant predictor for SAD
   (P < 0.05). Significant predictors of sleep quality included the extent
   of shift work (P < 0.05) and sleep duration (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions Work and sleep configurations appear to affect the weight
   status of CMV drivers. Shift work and sleep duration are both associated
   with the weight status of CMV drivers, and both appear to function as
   indicators of their sleep quality.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconducting nanowires have been explored for a number of applications
   in optoelectronics such as photodetectors and solar cells. Currently,
   there is ample interest in identifying the mechanisms that lead to
   photoresponse in nanowires in order to improve and optimize performance.
   However, distinguishing among the different mechanisms, including
   photovoltaic, photothermoelectric, photoemission, bolometric, and
   photoconductive, is often difficult using purely optoelectronic
   measurements. In this work, we present an approach for performing
   combined and simultaneous thermoelectric and optoelectronic measurements
   on the same individual nanowire. We apply the approach to GaN/AlGaN
   core/shell and GaN/AlGaN/GaN core/shell/shell nanowires and demonstrate
   the photothermoelectric nature of the photocurrent observed at the
   electrical contacts at zero bias, for above- and below-bandgap
   illumination. Furthermore, the approach allows for the experimental
   determination of the temperature rise due to laser illumination, which
   is often obtained indirectly through modeling. We also show that under
   bias, both above- and below-bandgap illumination leads to a
   photoresponse in the channel with signatures of persistent
   photoconductivity due to photogating. Finally, we reveal the concomitant
   presence of photothermoelectric and photogating phenomena at the
   contacts in scanning photocurrent microscopy under bias by using their
   different temporal response. Our approach is applicable to a broad range
   of nanomaterials to elucidate their fundamental optoelectronic and
   thermoelectric properties.}},

Abstract = {{The argument proffered in this paper is that use of enterprise social
   networking technologies can increase the accuracy of people's
   metaknowledge (knowledge of ``who knows what{''} and ``who knows
   whom{''}) at work. The results of a quasi-natural field experiment in
   which only one of two matched-sample groups within a large financial
   services firm was given access to the enterprise social networking
   technology for six months revealed that by making people's
   communications with specific partners visible to others in the
   organization, the technology enabled observers to become aware of the
   communications occurring amongst their coworkers and to make inferences
   about what and whom those coworkers knew based on the contents of the
   messages they sent and to whom they were sent. Consequently only
   individuals in the group that used the social networking technology for
   six months improved the accuracy of their metaknowledge (a 31\%
   improvement in knowledge of who knows what and an 88\% improvement in
   knowledge of who knows whom). There were no improvements in the other
   group over the same time period. Based on these findings, how
   technologically enabled ``ambient awareness{''}-awareness of ambient
   communications occurring amongst others in the organization-can be an
   important antecedent for knowledge acquisition is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo present a grading scale to assess the functional recovery of
   the facial nerve in patients who have undergone mimetic and static
   surgical techniques for facial reanimation.
   Study designThis is a proposed new facial nerve grading system that will
   be demonstrated with specific case presentations. All patients underwent
   a variety of neural grafting, microvascular free-flap reconstruction, or
   surgical static procedures.
   ResultsThe proposed facial nerve grading scale is one that has not been
   described previously in the literature and is applicable to a unique
   patient population. Its ease of use in this patient population will
   allow otolaryngologists to assess facial recovery accurately and quickly
   in cases where the facial nerve is not anatomically intact.
   ConclusionThe proposed facial recovery grading scale provides an
   efficient means of grading facial recovery for a unique group of
   patients who previously could not be followed. The proposed scale is
   practical and easy to use in a clinical setting.}},

Abstract = {{It is broadly acknowledged that freshwater ecosystems are affected by
   multiple stressors, but the relative importance of individual stressors
   in impairing riverine communities remains unclear. We investigated the
   impacts of multiple stressors, incorporating in-stream water quality,
   riparian and catchment land use and stream morphology, on riverine
   benthic invertebrate communities, while considering the spatial scales
   of factors and the heterogeneity of riverscapes. We performed a stepwise
   regression procedure linking 21 abiotic and 20 community metrics using
   Generalized Linear Models on data from 1018 river sites spread across
   Germany. High impact stressors (e.g., nutrients and water temperature)
   were identified for various community metrics. Both the combination of
   relevant stressors and their explanatory value differed significantly
   across streams of different sizes and ecoregions. In large rivers, the
   riparian land use was less important in determining community structure
   compared to lower order streams. Thus, possible mitigating effects of
   revegetated riparian buffer strips are likely to be overwhelmed by the
   influence of catchment-wide land use. Our results indicated substantial
   variability in stressors for the range of metrics studied, providing
   insight into potential target parameters for effective ecosystem
   management. To achieve long lasting successes in managing, protecting
   and restoring running waters, it is of vital importance to recognize the
   heterogeneity of riverscapes and to consider large-scale influences. (C)

Abstract = {{One of the most important challenges that the education will have to
   face is the need to adapt the learning process to the student's
   characteristics. Nowadays it is still noticed the weak technological

   Management Systems (LMS) and Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems.
   Both lines of development are converging so that the new versions of the
   LMS incorporate adaptive capacities that are allowing to design
   individualized or differentiated instruction. In this paper the adaptive
   functionalities available in Moodle are checked. It is explained how to
   implement three adaptive instructional designs in Moodle. Moreover, it
   is checked their effectiveness, in terms of the learning achieved by the
   student, and their efficiency, by reusing materials of previous learning

Abstract = {{We estimated the vertical land movement rates at tide gauge stations
   along the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) coasts. A novel approach suggested by Kuo
   et al. (2004, 2008) for combining satellite altimetry and tide gauge
   data was applied. The obtained vertical land motion rates were compared
   with the GPS vertical velocities measured at Galveston, Grand Isle,
   Dauphin Island, Pensacola and Key West stations. The estimated vertical
   rates range from slow subsidence in the South of Florida and Veracruz to
   high subsidence rates in Texas and Louisiana where some of the tide
   gauges subside at the rate of up to 7 mm/yr. A small but noticeable
   uplift in the NE of the Gulf was detected at Cedar Key and Apalachicola
   and a very low subsidence at Pensacola tide gauge. We suppose there are
   some local tectonic processes which contribute significantly to the land
   movement at these stations. Comparison with the post-glacial rebound
   model ICE5G-VM2 predictions shows that the drivers of the subsidence on
   the GOM shelf are of local nature. The resulted absolute sea level rise
   along the GOM coast was estimated to be about 2.0 +/- 0.4 mm/yr. (C)

Title = {{S-PMIPv6: An intra-LMA model for IPv6 mobility}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{180-191}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{IPv6 defined in RFC 2460 in the mid-1990s is an improved and streamlined
   successor version of IP version 4 (IPv4). It is designed to coexist with
   IPv4, while providing better internetworking capabilities than this
   successor version. Mobile IP enables a mobile node to be recognized via
   a single IP address even though the node is traveling from one network
   to another. Despite reposition among different networks, connectivity at
   different positions is attained continuously with no user intervention.
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), as a network-based mobility management
   protocol, was released in 2008 by the IETF in RFC 5213 to support IP
   mobility. But during MN's handover, disconnection of a network link
   cannot absolutely be avoided. The IETF later in 2010 in RFC 5949
   proposed Fast Proxy Mobile IPv6 (F-PMIPv6 for short) protocol, which was
   designed to mainly improve the reliability of its switching process,
   particularly for reducing its handover latency and packet loss rate, as
   well as lowering the probability of network-link disconnection. On the
   other hand, no matter how fast a handover is, its delay does unavoidably
   exist. It in turn rises the packet loss rate. Therefore, in this study,
   we propose a novel MIPv6 family protocol, called SCTP-based Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 (S-PMIPv6 for short), which integrates F-PMIPv6 with Stream Control
   Transmission Protects (SOP for short) and route optimization to enhance
   its IP mobility reliability and achieve the stage of seamless handover.
   Our simulation demonstrates that S-PMIPv6 can actually ``make{''} before
   ``break{''}, effectively shorten end-to-end delay of packet delivery and
   lower packet loss rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of machine learning algorithms has increased in a wide variety
   of domains (from finance to biocomputing and astronomy), and nowadays
   has a significant impact on the geoscience community. In most real cases
   geoscience data modelling problems are multivariate, high dimensional,

   processes. For such complex data, the spatial prediction of continuous
   (or categorical) variables is a challenging task. The aim of this paper
   is to investigate the potential of the recently developed Extreme
   Learning Machine (ELM) for environmental data analysis, modelling and
   spatial prediction purposes. An important contribution of this study
   deals with an application of a generic self-consistent methodology for
   environmental data driven modelling based on Extreme Learning Machine.

   STAT3, c-Jun, Akt, and autophagy factors}},
Journal = {{CELL DEATH \& DISEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hair cell damage is a side effect of cisplatin and aminoglycoside use.
   The inhibition or attenuation of this process is a target of many
   investigations. There is growing evidence that STAT1 deficiency
   decreases cisplatin-mediated ototoxicity; however, the role of STAT
   function and the molecules that act in gentamicin-mediated toxicity have
   not been fully elucidated. We used mice lacking STAT1 to investigate the
   effect of STAT1 ablation in cultured organs treated with cisplatin and
   gentamicin. Here we show that ablation of STAT1 decreased cisplatin
   toxicity and attenuated gentamicin-mediated hair cell damage. More
   TUNEL-positive hair cells were observed in explants of wild-type mice
   than that of STAT1(-/-) mice. Although cisplatin increased serine
   phosphorylation of STAT1 in wild-type mice and diminished STAT3
   expression in wild-type and STAT1(-/-) mice, gentamicin increased
   tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in STAT1(-/-) mice. The early
   inflammatory response was manifested in the upregulation of TNF-alpha
   and IL-6 in cisplatin-treated explants of wild-type and STAT1(-/-) mice.
   Expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was altered in
   cisplatin-treated explants, upregulated in wild-type explants, and
   downregulated in STAT1(-/-) explants. Cisplatin and gentamicin triggered
   the activation of c-Jun. Activation of Akt was observed in
   gentamicin-treated explants from STAT1(-/-) mice. Increased levels of
   the autophagy proteins Beclin-1 and LC3-II were observed in STAT1(-/-)
   explants. These data suggest that STAT1 is a central player in mediating
   ototoxicity. Gentamicin and cisplatin activate different downstream
   factors to trigger ototoxicity. Although cisplatin and gentamicin
   triggered inflammation and activated apoptotic factors, the absence of
   STAT1 allowed the cells to overcome the effects of these drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To compare the feasibility of training veterinary medicine
   students to perform laparoscopic versus conventional open ovariectomy in
   live dogs.
   Design-Randomized prospective parallel-group experiment.
   Population-25 students completing the second year of their veterinary
   curriculum. Procedures-Students were randomly assigned to 2 groups to
   receive 14 hours of specific training in either open ovariectomy (n =
   13) or laparoscopic ovariectomy (12). Confidence, basic surgical skills,
   and basic laparoscopic skills were evaluated before and after training,
   prior to live surgical procedures.
   Results-Scores related to basic surgical skills were high in both groups
   and did not improve with either training program. Before live animal
   surgeries, student confidence and basic laparoscopic skills improved
   after training in laparoscopic ovariectomy and were higher than after
   training in open ovariectomy. Surgery time was higher for the students
   who received training in laparoscopic ovariectomy (129 minutes; range,
   84 to 143 minutes), compared with students who received training in open
   ovariectomy (80 minutes; range, 62 to 117 minutes). On a 55-point
   scoring system, ovariectomy scores were similar between students who
   received training in open ovariectomy (34.5; range, 16.5 to 45) and
   students who received training in laparoscopic ovariectomy (34.5; range,
   25 to 44.5).
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The training programs were effective
   in improving student confidence and skills in laparoscopic ovariectomy.
   Results of this study suggested that veterinary medical students, with
   assistance from an instructor, may be taught to perform laparoscopic
   ovariectomies with performance equivalent to that for students
   performing open ovariectomies.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers single-component repairable systems performing
   backup procedures to avoid repeating the entire work from scratch and
   thus facilitate fast system recovery in the case of failures. The
   mission succeeds if a specified amount of work can be accomplished
   within the maximum allowed mission time or deadline. The repair time is
   randomly distributed within a specified interval. Both failure and
   repair times are represented by known distributions. We first suggest a
   numerical algorithm to evaluate mission reliability, conditional
   expected cost and completion time of a successful mission. The backup
   frequency optimization problem is then formulated and solved for finding
   the inter-backup interval that maximizes mission reliability or
   minimizes expected mission cost while satisfying a desired level of
   mission reliability. Impacts of parameters including the maximum allowed
   mission time, data backup and retrieval times, repair and failure time
   distributions, and repair efficiency on mission reliability, cost and
   time as well as on the optimal solution are investigated through
   examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Towards a national model for organ donation requests in Australia:

Journal = {{CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{233-238}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate whether structural elements of a collaborative
   requesting model were observed in practice, and explore the impact of
   specialised communications training and elements of the model on consent
   rates.
   Design: A national observational study captured staff observations of
   the organ donation requesting process.
   Setting: DonateLife staff in 15 hospitals collected data from medical,
   nursing and allied health professionals who participated in the donation
   requesting process over a 12-month period.
   Participants: Data were collected from 201 family donation conversations
   (FDCs).
   Main outcome measures: Whether structural elements of the model were
   observed in practice, and rates of consent to donate.
   Results: For most cases, there was a team planning meeting (87.0\%); a
   gap in time between the meeting at which family understands brain death
   or the inevitability of death and the FDC for most cases (72.0\%); and
   at least one trained requester present at the FDC (80.7\%). Consent
   rates were significantly different according to who led the FDC: an
   untrained treating clinical specialist (45.2\%); a trained treating
   clinical specialist (54.8\%); or a trained requester who was not part of
   the treating clinical team (74.5\%) (chi(2)=11.92, P=0.003). Logistic
   regression showed that the odds ratio (OR) for consent was significantly
   greater when the patient was on the Australian Organ Donor Register (OR,
   9.3; Cl, 3.5-24.5) and when the FDC was led by an FDC-trained requester
   who was not part of the treating clinical team (OR, 6.8; Cl, 2.3-19.9).
   Conclusions: Structural elements of the model were observed in most
   cases, indicating that the model is feasible and acceptable. We showed
   that the highest consent rates were achieved when FDCs were led by
   professionals who had completed the specialised communications training
   and were not part of the treating clinical team for that patient.}},

Abstract = {{The state and formation mechanism of alpha-Si3N4 in Fe-Si3N4 prepared by
   flash combustion were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning
   electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results
   indicate that alpha-Si3N4 crystals exist only in the Fe-Si3N4 dense
   areas. When FeSi75 particles react with N-2, which generates substantial
   heat, a large number of Si solid particles evaporate. The product
   between Si gas and N-2 is a mixture of alpha-Si3N4 and beta-Si3N4. At
   the later stage of the flash combustion process, alpha-Si3N4 crystals
   dissolve and reprecipitate as beta-Si3N4 and the beta-Si3N4 crystals
   grow outward from the dense areas in the product pool. As the
   temperature decreases, the alpha-Si3N4 crystals cool before transforming
   into beta-Si3N4 crystals in the dense areas of Fe-Si3N4. The phase
   composition of flash-combustion-synthesized Fe-Si3N4 is controllable
   through manipulation of the gas-phase reaction in the early stage and
   the alpha ->beta transformation in the later stage.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a novel tumor-immune index (TII) based on carcinoembryonic
   antigen levels, lymphocyte counts, and platelet counts, and explored its
   prognostic value in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The prognostic
   value of the TII was evaluated based on a retrospective study of 205
   patients with early NSCLC, who underwent resection in the whole year of
   2006, and validated in another group of 228 patients enrolled in the
   next year of 2007.The optimal cut-off point for the TII was 578x10(-9),
   and this value was used to stratify patients with NSCLC into low TII
   (578x10(-9)) and high TII (>578x10(-9)) groups. Univariate and
   multivariate analyses revealed that high TII was an independent
   predictor for overall survival and recurrence-free survival in both the
   training and validation cohorts. The areas under the curve of the TII
   for survival and recurrence were significantly larger than those for
   tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage and carcinoembryonic antigen. In the
   subgroup analysis, the TII was also significantly correlated with
   overall survival (P=0.001, P=0.009, and P=0.007 in the TNM I, II, and
   IIIa subgroups, respectively) and recurrence-free survival (P<0.001,
   P=0.006, and P=0.014 in the TNM I, II, and IIIa subgroups,
   respectively). Similarly, for patients with N2-positive tumors, the
   overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates for patients in the
   high TII group were also significantly lower than the respective values
   for patients in the low TII group (P=0.026 and P=0.007,
   respectively).The TII can be used to distinguish patients with similar
   pathologies and stages into high and low-risk categories based on the
   probability of recurrence according to a convenient blood-based test.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of heterodyne system is discussed for partially coherent
   beams in turbulent atmosphere by introducing turbulence spectrum of
   refractive-index fluctuations. Several analytic formulae for the
   heterodyne detection system using the partially coherent Gaussian
   Schell-model beam are presented. Based on Tatarskii spectrum model, some
   numerical results are given for the variation in the heterodyne
   efficiency with the misalignment angle, detector diameter, turbulence
   conditions, and parameters of the overlapping beams. According to the
   numerical results, we find that the turbulent atmosphere degrades the
   heterodyne efficiency significantly, and the variation in heterodyne
   efficiency is even slower against the misalignment angle in turbulence.
   For the deterministic received signal and the detector, the performance
   of the heterodyne detection can be adjusted by controlling the local
   oscillator signal parameters. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{F-1-ATPase (F-1) is a rotary motor protein that can efficiently convert
   chemical energy to mechanical work of rotation via fine coordination of
   its conformational motions and reaction sequences. Compared with
   reactant binding and product release, the ATP hydrolysis has relatively
   little contributions to the torque and chemical energy generation. To
   scrutinize possible roles of ATP hydrolysis, we investigate the detailed
   statistics of the catalytic dwells from high-speed single wild-type F-1
   observations. Here we report a small rotation during the catalytic dwell
   triggered by the ATP hydrolysis that is indiscernible in previous
   studies. Moreover, we find in freely rotating F-1 that ATP hydrolysis is
   followed by the release of inorganic phosphate with low synthesis rates.
   Finally, we propose functional roles of the ATP hydrolysis as a key to
   kinetically unlock the subsequent phosphate release and promote the
   correct reaction ordering.}},

Abstract = {{The preparation process of porous Cu35Ni15Cr alloy was studied in this
   paper. The effect of ball milling time and sintering temperature on the
   porosity of Cu35Ni15Cr alloy was identified. It was found that 18 h ball
   milling and 950 degrees C sintering are the most promising parameters
   for the preparation of porous Cu35Ni15Cr alloy. The products have a
   similar to 62 \% porosity. The alloy consists of an alpha phase and beta
   phase. The influence of deformation temperature and loading rate on the
   mechanical properties of Cu35Ni15Cr alloys was investigated. The results
   show that with decreasing deformation temperature, the yield strength
   and elastic modulus of the porous alloy increase. With the increase of
   loading rate, the yield strength of these alloys shows an increasing
   trend, but the elastic modulus is on a steady level.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Studies investigating the associations between CX3CR1 genetic
   polymorphisms and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have reported
   controversial results. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to clarify the
   effects of CX3CR1 T280M and V249I polymorphisms on AMD risk.
   Design: Meta-analysis.
   Participants: Results from six studies were pooled in the meta-analysis.
   Methods: Relevant studies were selected through an extensive search of
   PubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science databases. Pooled odds ratio (OR)
   and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random-effects
   model.
   Results: Six studies with were included in this systematic review and
   meta-analysis. There was no significant association between CX3CR1 T280M
   polymorphism and risk of AMD under all genetic models (TT vs CC/CT: OR =
   1.57, 95\% Cl = 0.87-2.84; CC vs TT/CT: OR = 0.75, 95\% Cl = 0.54-1.06;
   TT vs CC: OR = 0.58, 95\% Cl = 0.30-1.144; CT vs CC: OR = 1.25, 95\% Cl
   = 0.91-1.70). The CX3CR1 V249I polymorphism also did not significantly
   affect the AMD risk (AA vs GG/AG: OR = 1.23, 95\% Cl = 0.98-1.55; AG/AA
   vs GG: OR = 0.56, 95\% Cl = 0.29-1.07; AA vs GG: OR = 1.43, 95\% Cl =
   0.97-2.09; AG vs GG: OR = 1.07, 95\% Cl = 0.85-1.36).
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggested that CX3CR1 T280M and V249I
   polymorphisms may not be associated with an increased risk of AMD based
   on current published data. Given the limited sample size, the finding on
   CX3CR1 polymorphisms needs further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Urban tree species mapping is an important prerequisite to understanding
   the value of urban vegetation in ecological services. In this study, we
   explored the potential of bi-temporal WorldView-2 (WV2, acquired on 14
   September 2012) and WorldView-3 images (WV3, acquired on 18 October
   2014) for identifying five dominant urban tree species with the
   object-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)
   methods. Two study areas in Beijing, China, Capital Normal University
   (CNU) and Beijing Normal University (BNU), representing the typical
   urban environment, were evaluated. Three classification
   schemesclassification based solely on WV2; WV3; and bi-temporal WV2 and
   WV3 imageswere examined. Our study showed that the single-date image did
   not produce satisfying classification results as both producer and user
   accuracies of tree species were relatively low (44.7\%-82.5\%), whereas
   those derived from bi-temporal images were on average 10.7\% higher. In
   addition, the overall accuracy increased substantially (9.7\%-20.2\% for
   the CNU area and 4.7\%-12\% for BNU). A thorough analysis concluded that
   near-infrared 2, red-edge and green bands are always more important than
   the other bands to classification, and spectral features always
   contribute more than textural features. Our results also showed that the
   scattered distribution of trees and a more complex surrounding
   environment reduced classification accuracy. Comparisons between SVM and
   RF classifiers suggested that SVM is more effective for urban tree
   species classification as it outperforms RF when working with a smaller
   amount and imbalanced distribution of samples.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a general multitiered supply chain network
   equilibrium model consisting of competing suppliers and competing firms
   who purchase components for the assembly of their final branded products
   and, if capacity permits, and it enhances profits, produce their own
   components. The competitive behavior of each tier of decision-makers is
   described along with their strategic variables, which include quality of
   the components and, in the case of the firms, the quality of the
   assembly process itself. The governing equilibrium conditions of the
   supply chain network are formulated as a variational inequality and
   qualitative properties are presented. The algorithm, accompanied with
   convergence results, is then applied to numerical supply chain network
   examples, along with sensitivity analysis in which the impacts of
   capacity disruptions and complete supplier elimination are investigated.

Title = {{Specific Interaction between eEF1A and HIV RT Is Critical for HIV-1
   Reverse Transcription and a Potential Anti-HIV Target}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Reverse transcription is the central defining feature of HIV-1
   replication. We previously reported that the cellular eukaryotic
   elongation factor 1 (eEF1) complex associates with the HIV-1 reverse
   transcription complex (RTC) and the association is important for late
   steps of reverse transcription. Here we show that association between
   the eEF1 and RTC complexes occurs by a strong and direct interaction
   between the subunit eEF1A and reverse transcriptase (RT). Using biolayer
   interferometry and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays, we show that
   association between the eEF1 and RTC complexes occurs by a strong (K-D
   similar to 3-4 nM) and direct interaction between eEF1A and reverse
   transcriptase (RT). Biolayer interferometry analysis of cell lysates
   with titrated levels of eEF1A indicates it is a predominant cellular RT
   binding protein. Both the RT thumb and connection domains are required
   for interaction with eEF1A. A single amino acid mutation, W252A, within
   the thumb domain impaired co-IP between eEF1A and RT, and also
   significantly reduced the efficiency of late reverse transcription and
   virus replication when incorporated into infectious HIV-1. Molecular
   modeling analysis indicated that interaction between W252 and L303 are
   important for RT structure, and their mutation to alanine did not impair
   heterodimerisation, but negatively impacted interaction with eEF1A.
   Didemnin B, which specifically binds eEF1A, potently inhibited HIV-1
   reverse transcription by greater than 2 logs at subnanomolar
   concentrations, especially affecting reverse transcription late DNA
   synthesis. Analysis showed reduced levels of RTCs from HIV-1-infected
   HEK293T treated with didemnin B compared to untreated cells.
   Interestingly, HIV-1 with a W252A RT mutation was resistant to didemnin
   B negative effects showing that didemnin B affects HIV-1 by targeting
   the RT-eEF1A interaction. The combined evidence indicates a direct
   interaction between eEF1A and RT is crucial for HIV reverse
   transcription and replication, and the RT-eEF1A interaction is a
   potential drug target.}},

   to the reinforced glass ionomer cement at three different weight ratios
   to obtain a series of nano silver-containing cements, then two
   orthodontic cement products and three NSC samples were implanted into
   rat caries disease model, and their antibacterial properties were
   evaluated by the scanning electron microscope(SEM). Moreover, the rat
   caries disease model were established by inoculating cariogenic bacteria
   S mutans into antibiotics treated rat mouths and feeding with cariogenic
   diet. The tested materials were bonded on the surface of the buccal half
   crowns of the upper first premolar, and then fixed under the rats'front
   teeth lingual side to acquire enough retention. The SEM results
   indicated that the growth of streptococcus mutans was very active in
   group of Transbond XT. One month later, S mutans scattered on the GC
   Fuji ORTHO LC surface, and then the number significantly increased and
   arranged in chains after three months. In groups of NSC2, NSC3 and NSC4,
   the number of S mutans presented the downward trend and tended to
   disperse individually with the increase of silver nanoparticle content.
   We may conclude that the incorporation of silver nanoparticle enhanced

   dorsolateral approach or post-middle approach. Clinical results of 62
   fingers of 53 patients with proximal phalangeal fracture were evaluated.
   For dorsolateral approach, the lateral bundle of the extensor tendon was
   drawn away to expose the fracture part of the bone. After reduction, the
   plate was located at the dorsolateral side of the bone. For post-middle
   approach, the extensor tendon was split to expose the fracture part of
   the bone. After reduction, the plate was fixed to the proximal
   phalangeal side of the bone, and the extensor tendon was repaired with
   3-0 nonabsorbable silk sutures. We found low overall complication rates
   in both groups. The mean total active motion (TAM) for the dorsolateral
   group and post-middle group was 234.60 degrees +/- 22.63 degrees and
   221.08 degrees +/- 25.69 degrees, respectively. There was a statistical
   significance between the two groups (P=0.037<0.05), indicating that TAM
   was notably affected by various fixation methods. With AO mini titanium
   plate, movement in dorsolateral approach group was significantly higher
   than in post-middle approach group. Dorsolateral approach is an
   acceptable technique of incision for proximal phalangeal fractures.}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembly by means of coordinative bond formation has opened up
   opportunities for the high-yield synthesis of molecules with complex
   topologies. However, the preparation of purely covalent molecular
   architectures in aqueous media has remained a challenging task. Here, we
   present the preparation of a three-dimensional catenane through a
   self-assembly process that relies on the formation of dynamic hydrazone
   linkages in an acidic aqueous medium. The quantitative synthesis process
   and the mechanically interlocked structure of the resulting catenane
   were established by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X-ray
   crystallography and HPLC studies. In addition, the labile hydrazone
   linkages of the individual {[}2] catenane components may be `locked' by
   increasing the pH of the solution, yielding a relatively kinetically
   stable molecule. The present study thus details a simple approach to the
   creation and control of complex molecular architectures under reaction
   conditions that mimic biological milieux.}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{In order to detect the road marking paint from the trace evidence in
   traffic accident scene, and to differentiate their brands, we use
   Tri-level infrared spectroscopic identification, which employs the
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), the second derivative
   infrared spectroscopy(SD-IR), two-dimensional correlation infrared
   spectroscopy(2D-IR) to identify three different domestic brands of hot
   melting reflective road marking paints and their raw materials in
   formula we Selected. The experimental results show that three labels
   coatings in ATR and FTIR spectrograms are very similar in shape, only
   have different absorption peak wave numbers, they have wide and strong
   absorption peaks near 1 435 cm(-1), and strong absorption peak near 879,
   2 955, 2 919, 2 870 cm(-1). After enlarging the partial areas of
   spectrograms and comparing them with each kind of raw material of
   formula spectrograms, we can distinguish them. In the region 700 similar
   to 970 and 1 370 similar to 1 660 cm(-1) the spectrograms mainly reflect
   the different relative content of heavy calcium carbonate of three
   brands of the paints, and that of polyethylene wax (PE wax), ethylene
   vinyl acetate resin (EVA), dioctyl phthalate (DOP) in the region 2 800
   similar to 2 960 cm(-1). The SD-IR not only verify the result of the
   FTIR analysis, but also further expand the microcosmic differences and
   reflect the different relative content of quartz sand in the 512-799
   cm(-1) region. Within the scope of the 1 351 to 1 525 cm(-1), 2D-IR have
   more significant differences in positions and numbers of automatically
   peaks. Therefore, the Tri-level infrared spectroscopic identification is
   a fast and effective method to distinguish the hot melting road marking
   paints with a gradually improvement in apparent resolution.}},

Abstract = {{We combine new Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck with
   Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data to constrain the Brans-Dicke (BD)
   theory, in which the gravitational constant G evolves with time.
   Observations of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) provide another important set
   of cosmological data, as they may be regarded as standard candles after
   some empirical corrections. However, in theories that include modified
   gravity like the BD theory, there is some risk and complication when
   using the SNIa data because their luminosity may depend on G. In this
   paper, we assume a power law relation between the SNIa luminosity and G,
   but treat the power index as a free parameter. We then test whether the
   difference in distances measured with SNIa data and BAO data can be
   reduced in such a model. We also constrain the BD theory and
   cosmological parameters by making a global fit with the CMB, BAO and
   SNla data set. For the CMB+BAO+SNIa data set, we find 0.08 x 10(-2) <
   zeta < 0.33 x 10(-2) at the 68\% confidence level (CL) and -0.01 x
   10(-2) < zeta < 0.43 x 10(-2) at the 95\% CL, where zeta is related to
   the BD parameter omega by zeta = ln(1 + 1/omega).}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to explore the impact of Modic-2 changes on
   the clinical outcomes of single-level anterior cervical discectomy and
   fusion.
   This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 35 ACDF
   patients with Modic-2 changes at adjacent level (Group A) and 213
   patients without Modic-2 changes at adjacent level (Group B). Clinical
   and radiographic evaluations were performed preoperatively and repeated
   at 3, 6, 12, and 60 months after surgery.
   All patients were followed up for an average of 60 months. The clinical
   improvements in terms of NDI and JOA scores were achieved in both groups
   (P < 0.05), and no significant differences were found between the two
   groups (P > 0.05). The radiologic review demonstrated ASD was proven in
   9 patients in Group A and 52 patients in Group B. A significant increase
   in ROM at the adjacent segments after surgery was observed in both
   groups (P < 0.05). No significant differences in adjacent segment ROM
   and DH were observed between two groups (P > 0.05). Comparing the
   outcome VAS of axial symptoms with Group A after surgery, patients in
   the Group B reported significantly lower VAS of axial symptoms at 1-year
   follow-up (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the
   two groups at the final follow-up (P > 0.05).
   Modic-2 changes at adjacent level at baseline does not affect fusion
   rate or clinical outcome based on functional status but could negatively
   impact axial symptoms intensity and ASD, compared to patients without
   Modic-2 changes.}},

   framework. It is capable of dealing with not only health risk itself
   (generally caused by uncertainty), but also parameter uncertainty (e.g.,
   slope factor and reference dose) in health risk assessment. This
   approach is applied to a contaminated site in western Canada for
   creating a set of optimal remediation strategies. Carcinogenic and
   noncarcinogenic risks associated with the strategies are further
   evaluated under four confidence levels (68.26, 90, 95 and 99.72 \%).
   Results from the case study indicate that (i) the wells have varied
   contributions to groundwater remediation under different remediation
   periods and environmental standards; (ii) total pumping rate is mainly
   controlled by health risk constraints and a stringent health risk
   standard leads to a high total pumping rate; (iii) remediation period
   has a significant impact on health risk mitigation, but the marginal
   impact does not always increase; (iv) the impact of confidence level of
   slope factor on health risk is obvious, i.e., the larger the confidence
   level, the higher the health risk.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common epilepsy subtype with
   complex genetic structure. A recent study in four populations (Ireland,
   UK, Australia and Finland) reported an allelic association between
   betaine/GABA transporter-1 (BGT-1 or SLC6A12) and mesial temporal lobe
   epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis. To demonstrate the association
   between SLC6A12 gene polymorphisms and TLE, TaqMan method was used to
   genotype five single-nucleotide polymorphisms of SLC6A12 gene in 358 TLE
   patients and 596 nonepileptic control subjects of Chinese Han origin.
   Real-time PCR was used to detect the effects of variations on gene
   expression associated with TLE. Though, the single-marker analysis did
   not demonstrate allelic association with TLE, rs542736-rs557881
   interaction showed significant association. The SLC6A12 expression
   levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were significantly higher
   in TLE patients than in control subjects and were correlated to rs542736
   G-rs557881 A haplotypes. Our preliminary results suggested combined
   effect of two common polymorphisms on SLC6A12 gene may be associated
   with TLE, but the precise mechanism needs further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of terahertz technology and photonic crystal provides a
   new approach to realize compact terahertz wave devices. Relying on a
   conventional photonic crystal waveguide and photonic crystal
   surface-mode waveguides, a tunable multi-channel terahertz-wave power
   splitter is proposed. The mechanism of such a power splitter is further
   theoretically analyzed and numerically investigated with the aid of the
   plane-wave-expansion method and the finite-difference time-domain
   method. With an appropriate design, the proposed device can split the
   input terahertz wave energy equally into six output ports at the
   frequency of 0.6 THz. When changing the external magnetic field, the
   input terahertz wave can be equally divided into four output ports with
   the aid of a magnetic-sensitive material. Furthermore, the present
   device is very compact and the total size is of 4.4 x 6.0 mm(2). (C)

Title = {{Age-Related Inter-Region EEG Coupling Changes During the Control of
   Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{We investigated age-related changes in electroencephalographic (BEG)
   coupling of theta-, alpha-, and beta frequency bands during bottom up
   and top down attention. Arrays were presented with either automatic
   ``pop-out{''} (bottom-up) or effortful ``search{''} (top-down) behavior
   to younger and older participants. The phase-locking value was used to
   estimate coupling strength between scalp recordings. Behavioral
   performance decreased with age, with a greater age related decline in
   accuracy for the search than for the pop-out condition. Aging was
   associated with a declined coupling strength of theta and alpha
   frequency bands, with a greater age-related decline in whole-brain
   coupling values for the search than for the pop out condition.
   Specifically, prefronto-frontal coupling in theta- and alpha-bands,
   fronto-parietal and parieto-occipital couplings in beta-band for younger
   group showed a right hemispheric dominance, which was reduced with aging
   to compensate for the inhibitory dysfunction. While pop-out target
   detection was mainly associated with greater parieto-occipital beta
   coupling strength compared to search condition regardless of aging.
   Furthermore, prefronto-frontal coupling in theta-, alpha-, and
   beta-bands, and parieto-occipital coupling in beta-band functioned as
   predictors of behavior for both groups. Taken together these findings
   provide evidence that prefronto-frontal coupling of theta-, alpha-, and
   beta-bands may serve as a possible basis of aging during visual
   attention, while parieto-occipital coupling in beta-band could serve for
   a bottom-up function and be vulnerable to top-down attention control for
   younger and older groups.}},

Abstract = {{In solving small-to medium-scale travelling salesman problems (TSPs) of
   both symmetric and asymmetric types, the traditional ant colony
   optimization (ACO) algorithm could work well, providing high accuracy
   and satisfactory efficiency. However, when the scale of the TSP
   increases, ACO, a heuristic algorithm, is greatly challenged with
   respect to accuracy and efficiency. A novel pheromone-trail updating
   strategy that moderately reduces the iteration time required in real
   optimization problem-solving is proposed. In comparison with the
   traditional strategy of the ACO in several experiments, the proposed
   strategy shows advantages in performance. Therefore, this strategy of
   pheromone-trail updating is proposed as a valuable approach that reduces
   the time-complexity and increases its efficiency with less iteration
   time in real optimization applications. Moreover, this strategy is
   especially applicable in solving the moderate large-scale TSPs based on
   ACO.}},

Abstract = {{Bioactivity guided assay of Gancao showed the flavonoids as being

   suggested three effective flavonoids, alpha, 4, 2', 4'
   tetrahydroxydihydrochalcone (8), licochalcone A (12), and licoflavone B
   (20) as being responsible for the chemopreventive effect. Furthermore,
   AutoDock 4.2 was employed for molecular docking to clarify the
   interaction between bioactive flavonoids and NQO1. HPLC analysis was
   performed to determine the contents of 8, 12 and 20. Therefore the

Abstract = {{We examine the determinants of events of default clauses in syndicated

   repayment of principal and to terminate lending commitments. We document
   significant variation in the use of default clauses and their
   restrictiveness within the same type of lending contract but also across
   loans and bonds. We find that default clauses in public bond contracts
   are less restrictive than those in syndicated loan contracts. We also
   document that two ex ante proxies for bankruptcy costs, the level of
   intangible assets and capitalized research and development expenditures
   at the time of debt contracting, are associated with less restrictive
   default clauses, especially in bond contracts. We conclude that
   bondholders attempt to mitigate the occurrence of inefficient defaults.
   Given their inability to coordinate with each other and their ownership
   of subordinated claims, bondholders incur higher default costs than bank
   lenders.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes a closed-loop system identification procedure for
   hybrid continuous-time Box-Jenkins models and demonstrates how it can be
   used for IMC based PID controller tuning. An instrumental variable
   algorithm is used to identify hybrid continuous-time transfer function
   models of the Box-Jenkins form from discrete-time prefilterecl data
   where the process model is a continuous-time transfer function, while
   the noise is represented as a discrete-time ARMA process. A novel
   penalized maximum-likelihood approach is used for estimating the
   discrete-time ARMA process and a circulatory noise elimination
   identification method is employed to estimate process model. The
   input-output data of a process are affected by additive circulatory
   noise in a closed-loop. The noise-free input-output data of the process
   are obtained using the proposed method by removing these circulatory
   noise components. The process model can be achieved by using
   instrumental variable estimation method with prefiltered noise-free
   input-output data The performance of the proposed hybrid parameter
   estimation scheme is evaluated by the Monte Carlo simulation analysis.
   Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed procedure.
   The methodology has been successfully applied in tuning of IMC based
   flow controller and a practical application demonstrates the
   applicability of the algorithm. (C) 2015 The Chemical Industry and

Abstract = {{Preclinical studies suggested that insulin, incretin and
   thiazolidinediones had effect on regulation of bone metabolism. But
   clinical evidence is limited. We assessed the effects of these
   antihyperglycemic agents on bone metabolism in patients with newly
   diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
   The present study was a two-center, randomized, parallel-group clinical
   trial. Sixty-two newly diagnosed and drug-na < ve patients with type 2
   diabetes were randomized to exenatide (EXE, n = 20), mixed protamine
   zinc recombinant human insulin lispro injection (25R; INS, n = 21) or
   pioglitazone (PIO, n = 21) group for a 24-week treatment. Glycosylated
   hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body weight, body mineral density (BMD) and
   fasting serum concentration of bone turnover markers including
   osteocalcin (OC), C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) and
   tartrate-resistant alkaline phosphatase 5b (TRAcP5b) were assessed at
   baseline and week 24.
   Baseline characteristics were similar among groups. At week 24, HbA1c
   improved in all patients (EXE:-2.4 +/- A 0.3 \%, INS:-2.4 +/- A 0.3 \%,
   PIO:-2.0 +/- A 0.2 \%; p > 0.05 among groups). Patients treated with
   exenatide lost body weight remarkably (-4.7 +/- A 0.8 kg). In spite of
   the amelioration of glucose control, no significant improvement of OC,
   CTX or TRAcP5b was observed at week 24 (EXE: OC -0.619 +/- A 0.728
   ng/ml, CTX 0.147 +/- A 0.046 ng/ml, TRAcP5b 0.302 +/- A 0.149 U/L;INS:
   OC 0.637 +/- A 0.787 ng/ml, CTX -0.012 +/- A 0.074 ng/ml, TRAcP5b 0.124

   ng/ml, TRAcP5b 0.586 +/- A 0.183 U/L; p > 0.05), as well as BMD
   measurement, regardless of the treatments.
   Twenty-four-week treatment with exenatide, insulin and pioglitazone
   improved glucose control in patients with newly diagnosed type 2
   diabetes, but had no impact on bone turnover markers or BMD.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we investigated the role of glutathione (GSH) and
   its related enzymes in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats subjected to
   microcystin-leucine-arginine (MCLR)-induced hepatotoxicity. SD rats were
   intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with MCLR after pretreating with or
   without buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of GSH
   synthesis. The depletion of GSH with BSO enhanced MCLR-induced oxidative
   stress, resulting in more severe liver damage and higher MCLR
   accumulation. Similarly, the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), total
   GSH (T-GSH), oxidized GSH (GSSG) and GSH were significantly enhanced in
   BSO pretreated rats following MCLR treatment. The study showed that the
   transcription of GSH-related enzymes such as glutathione-S-transferase
   (GST), gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), glutathione
   reductase (GR) varied in different ways (expect for glutathione
   peroxidase (GPx), whose gene expression was induced in all treated
   groups) with or without BSO pretreatment before MCLR exposure,
   suggesting an adaptative response of GSH-related enzymes at
   transcription level to combat enhancement of oxidative stress induced by
   MCLR when pretreated with BSO. These data suggested the tissues with low
   GSH concentration are highly vulnerable to MCLR toxicity and GSH was
   critical for the detoxification in MCLR-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo.

Abstract = {{The constructed cost of conventional noise walls is about \$2 million
   per linear mile. In many areas, the cost-effectiveness criteria of
   \$25,000 per benefited receiver are exceeded so that these areas are not
   eligible for federal-aid funding for noise abatement. Consequently, the
   residents in these areas are dissatisfied that no noise reduction
   measures are provided to them. To address these issues, the Indiana
   Department of Transportation evaluated the line of sight (LOS) wall to
   improve customer satisfaction at a less expensive cost. Three different
   LOS walls were installed and compared with the conventional concrete
   noise wall. Such information will be useful to state departments of
   transportation not only to develop specifications for LOS walls, but
   also to upgrade their traffic noise policy to improve customer services.

Abstract = {{Plant phospholipase D (PLD), which can hydrolyze membrane phospholipids
   to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), a secondary signaling molecule, has
   been proposed to function in diverse plant stress responses. In this
   research, a qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of a cucumber
   phospholipase D alpha gene (CsPLD alpha) was induced by salt and drought
   stresses in the roots and leaves. To further study the roles of CsPLD
   alpha in regulating plant tolerance to salt, polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   and abscisic acid (ABA) stresses, transgenic tobacco plants
   constitutively overexpressing CsPLD alpha were produced. A qRT-PCR
   analysis showed that the CsPLD alpha transcript levels were high in
   transgenic tobacco lines, whereas no expression was found in wild type
   (WT) tobacco, indicating that CsPLD alpha was successfully transferred
   into the tobacco genome and overexpressed. Under normal conditions for
   30 d, seeds of transgenic lines germinated neatly, and the seedlings
   were robust and bigger than WT plants. When treated with different
   concentrations of NaCl, PEG and ABA, germination rates and seedling
   sizes of the transgenic lines were significantly greater than WT. In
   addition, the germination times for transgenic lines were also
   remarkably shorter. Further studies indicated that transgenic lines had
   longer primary roots and more biomass accumulation than WT plants. The
   water loss in transgenic lines was also much lower than in WT. These
   findings suggest that the CsPLD alpha overexpression positively
   regulates plant tolerance to hyperosmotic stresses, and that CsPLD alpha
   is involved in the ABA regulation of stomatal closure and the
   alleviation of ABA inhibition on seed germination and seedling growth.

Abstract = {{The viscoelastic properties of gelled oil can reflect its structural
   characteristics, which are significant for the restart operation of
   prolonged-shutdown pipelines. The viscoelastic properties of
   water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions are more complicated on account of the
   influence from the dispersed water phase, which cannot be ignored. This
   paper attempts to reveal the relationship of viscoelastic
   characteristics to temperature and water fraction for waxy crude
   emulsion gels from a micro perspective. As a basis of the rheological
   analysis, the droplet size and distribution of inner phase are studied
   with microscopic observation. It is found that both the total number and
   Sauter mean diameter of dispersed droplets increase with growth of the
   water fraction. Through a series of small amplitude oscillatory shear
   experiments, the linear viscoelastic regions and the viscoelastic
   parameters of emulsion gels with different water fractions are obtained
   and compared under varying temperatures. The results provide evidence
   that as the water fraction rises, the structural strength of emulsion
   gels becomes stronger. This can mainly be attributed to the larger
   deformable oil-water interface area with adsorbed wax crystals and the
   stronger interactions among water droplets. Based on the experimental
   results, regression formulas for viscoelastic parameters, including
   elastic modulus, loss modulus, and loss angle, are proposed and proven
   reliable. This offers useful information for the restart operation of
   oil-water multiphase transportation pipelines.}},

   Imbalance for Wideband Direct-Conversion Transmitters}},

Abstract = {{A low cost frequency-dependent (FD) I/Q imbalance self-compensation
   scheme is investigated in this paper. The direct conversion transmitters
   are widely used in wireless systems. However, the unwanted
   image-frequencies and distortions are inevitably introduced into the
   direct conversion system. This problem is even severer in wideband
   systems. Therefore, the accurate estimation and compensation of I/Q
   imbalance is crucial. The current compensation method is based on
   external instruments or internal feedback path which introduces
   additional impairments and is expensive. This paper proposes a low cost
   FD I/Q imbalance self-IQ-demodulation based compensation scheme without
   using external calibration instruments. First, the impairments of
   baseband and RF components are investigated. Further, I/Q imbalance
   model is developed. Then, the proposed two-step self-IQ-demodulation
   based compensation scheme is investigated. In the first step of the
   scheme, the local oscillator (LO) related I/Q impairments parameters are
   estimated. Then in the second step, the overall FD I/Q imbalance
   parameters are estimated by utilizing the transmitter LO. To realize
   this self-IQ-demodulation algorithm, this paper introduces minor
   modifications to the current power detector circuit. Afterwards, the
   estimated parameters are applied to the baseband equivalent compensator.
   This sophisticated algorithm guarantees low computation complexity and
   low cost. The compensation performance is evaluated in laboratory
   measurement.}},

Abstract = {{It is found that several layer-phase group-III monochalcogenides,
   including GaS, GaSe, and InSe, are piezoelectric in their monolayer
   form. First-principles calculations reveal that the piezoelectric
   coefficients of monolayer GaS, GaSe, and InSe (2.06, 2.30, and 1.46 pm
   center dot V-(TM) 1) are of the same order of magnitude as previously
   discovered two-dimensional (2D) piezoelectric materials such as boron
   nitride (BN) and MoS2 monolayers. This study therefore indicates that a
   strong piezoelectric response can be obtained in a wide range of
   two-dimensional materials with broken inversion symmetry. The
   co-existence of piezoelectricity and superior photo-sensitivity in these
   monochalcogenide monolayer semiconductors means they have the potential
   to allow for the integration of electromechanical and optical sensors on
   the same material platform.}},

Abstract = {{Three types of alpha-MnO2 nanomaterials are synthesized in different
   Mn-based precursor solutions by using a facile electrochemical
   deposition at the same depositional condition. The relationships between
   the precursor solutions and corresponding MnO2 nanomaterials' morphology
   as well as the electrochemical performance have been studied. As an
   electrode, electrochemical measurements show that the MnO2 deposited in
   MnCl2 precursor solution (MnO2-P3) exhibits an enhanced specific
   capacitance (318.9 F g(-1) at 2 mV s(-1)). Moreover, this electrode
   demonstrates a good rate capability with 44\% retention, which is higher
   than the MnO2-P1 deposited with Mn(CH3COOH)(2) solution and the MnO2-P2
   deposited with Mn(NO3)(2) precursor solution. Besides, the specific
   capacitance of the MnO2-P3 electrode nearly has 98.2\% retention after
   2000 cycles, showing good long-term cycle stability. These findings show
   that the MnO2-P3 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.

Abstract = {{Healthy status monitoring of train bearing online is very meaningful

   is proposed. The monitoring system consists two sequential parts. First,
   extract fault features based on SFFT spectrum and other time-domain
   parameters. According to train bearing working environment, altogether 7
   fault features are extracted in this paper. Another part is constructing
   a classifier based on BP neural network. Experimental results show that
   the system proposed here achieves gratifying results comparing with
   traditional fault diagnosis system}},

Abstract = {{Based on 3DG110 transistors and special gated NPN (GNPN) transistors,
   the characteristic of the synergistic effect between ionization and
   displacement defects induced by 40-MeV silicon (Si) ions with low
   fluence was investigated in terms of deep-level transient spectroscopy
   (DLTS). Nonlinear relationship, produced by the synergistic effect,
   between low fluence and radiation response can be obviously observed in
   the bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) under the exposure of 40-MeV Si
   ions. The DLTS signals of displacement defect centers and oxide-trapped
   charges are detected in the base-collector junction of the 3DG110
   transistors. Meanwhile, based on the GNPN transistors, the DLTS signals
   of interface traps and displacement defects are measured in the
   base-collector junction. By comparison of the change in electrical
   parameters and the DLTS signals, it is found that the interface traps
   induce an enhanced effect to displacement defects in the base-collector
   junction of NPN BJT, whereas the oxide-trapped charge can suppress the
   DLTS signals of deep-level centers to a certain extent. Compared with
   the suppression action, the enhanced effect rising from ionization
   damage gives more contribution to the displacement damage. Moreover, the
   bias used during DLTS measurements can influence the characteristics of
   DLTS signals caused by oxide-trapped charge and interface traps. With
   increasing bias, both the height and temperature of ionization defect
   peaks in the DLTS spectra will increase, illustrating that concentration
   and energy level of these defects are raised.}},

Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Using a plasma jet composed of two needle electrodes, a laminar plasma
   plume with large volume is generated in air through an alternating
   current voltage excitation. Based on highspeed photography, a train of
   filaments is observed to propagate periodically away from their birth
   place along the gas flow. The laminar plume is in fact a temporal
   superposition of the arched filament train. The filament consists of a
   negative glow near the real time cathode, a positive column near the
   real time anode, and a Faraday dark space between them. It has been
   found that the propagation velocity of the filament increases with
   increasing the gas flow rate. Furthermore, the filament lifetime tends
   to follow a normal distribution (Gaussian distribution). The most
   probable lifetime decreases with increasing the gas flow rate or
   decreasing the averaged peak voltage. Results also indicate that the
   real time peak current decreases and the real time peak voltage
   increases with the propagation of the filament along the gas flow. The
   voltage-current curve indicates that, in every discharge cycle, the
   filament evolves from a Townsend discharge to a glow one and then the
   discharge quenches. Characteristic regions including a negative glow, a
   Faraday dark space, and a positive column can be discerned from the
   discharge filament. Furthermore, the plasma parameters such as the
   electron density, the vibrational temperature and the gas temperature
   are investigated based on the optical spectrum emitted from the laminar
   plume.}},

Abstract = {{A fully grouted cable bolt is normally loaded at rock joints by a
   combination of the axial and shear forces causing both axial extension
   and shear deformation of the cable. The proposed analyses presented here
   attempts to predict the joint shear strength and shear displacement. The
   analyses are based on the statically indeterminate beam theory and some
   basic findings and conclusions of other researchers. Parametrical
   investigation is performed on four influence factors including bolt
   pretension, joint friction angle, concrete strength and bolt
   installation angle. Although the true plastic moduli of the cable bolt
   deflecting section at failure are the essential parameters in this
   analysis, they are practically impossible to determine. Thus, the
   average cable moduli obtained from the cable tensile strength tests were
   used. The proposed analytical model was compared with the experimental
   results, showing a good agreement. This analytical work aims to develop
   a simple tool for the practicing geotechnical engineer to effectively
   evaluate the cable shear behaviour and the influence of fully grouted
   cable bolts on joint shear resistance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The different crack initiation modes from different internal defects of

   m(1/2). The crack growth process in GBF is further investigated by the
   low high two-step variable amplitude (TSAL) tests. The crack growth
   process in GBF can be described by {[}(area(GBF))(1/2)/(area(inc))(1/2),
   =alpha(1-beta N-f)(m0). The exponent, mo, is a material constant
   independent of the applied stress amplitude and the inclusion size, and

Abstract = {{This study determined the prevalence and distribution of
   plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC) beta-lactamases in Irish Escherichia coli
   isolates. Clinical E. coli isolates (n = 95) that were intermediate or
   resistant to cefoxitin and/or flagged by VITEKe (R) as potential
   AmpC-producers underwent confirmation using a MASTDISCS (TM) ESBL and
   AmpC Detection Kit. Multiplex PCR capable of detecting family-specific
   plasmid ampC genes was performed to detect the presence of these genes.
   Five PCR-negative isolates were selected for promoter analysis. PFGE and
   MLST were performed on E. coli isolates that harboured a plasmid ampC
   gene to determine their clonal relatedness. Plasmid ampC genes were
   detected in 19\% (18/95) of phenotypic AmpC producing E. coli isolates.
   The CIT group was the most common plas mid family type (n = 14); DHA (n
   = 3) and ACC (n = 1) groups were also detected. Promoter analysis showed
   that four isolates had multiple point mutations and one had a 1 bp
   insertion in the 10 box. PFGE demonstrated a polyclonal pattern for E.
   coli isolates. Furthermore, with the exception of two isolates with an
   identical sequence type (ST720), MLST analysis revealed that these
   isolates were not clonally related. This study revealed that there was a
   marked prevalence of pAmpC E. coli among phenotypic AmpC producing E.
   coli isolates but no evidence of cross-transmission of a single strain.
   Establishing the prevalence and clonality of these organisms is
   important in order to implement evidence-based infection control
   measures that reduce the spread of pAmpC beta-lactamase resistance in
   the hospital environment. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

   roasting with transformation ratio of 92.75\% at 650 A degrees C.
   Roasting temperature has a significant influence on the phase

Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a brain dysfunction for which there is no
   present effective treatment, is often caused by a concussive impact to
   the head and affects an estimated 1.7 million Americans annually. Our
   laboratory previously demonstrated that exendin-4, a long-lasting
   glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, has neuroprotective
   effects in cellular and animal models of TBI. Here, we demonstrate
   neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of a different GLP-1R agonist,
   liraglutide, in neuronal cultures and a mouse model of mild TBI (mTBI).
   Liraglutide promoted dose-dependent proliferation in SH-SY5Y cells and
   in a GLP-1R over-expressing cell line at reduced concentrations.
   Pre-treatment with liraglutide rescued neuronal cells from oxidative
   stress-and glutamate excitotoxicity-induced cell death. Liraglutide
   produced neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects similar to those of
   exendin-4 in vitro. The cAMP/PKA/pCREB pathway appears to play an
   important role in this neuroprotective activity of liraglutide.
   Furthermore, our findings in cell culture were well-translated in a
   weight drop mTBI mouse model. Post-treatment with a clinically relevant
   dose of liraglutide for 7 days in mice ameliorated memory impairments
   caused by mTBI when evaluated 7 and 30 days post trauma. These data
   cross-validate former studies of exendin-4 and suggest that liraglutide
   holds therapeutic potential for the treatment of mTBI.}},

   phthalocyaninato-zinc(II) (ZnPc) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been
   investigated using various spectroscopic methods. This work may provide
   some useful information for understanding the interaction mechanism of
   anticancer drug-albumin binding and gain insight into the biological
   activity and metabolism of the drug in blood. Based on analysis of the
   fluorescence spectra, ZnPc could quench the intrinsic fluorescence of
   BSA and the quenching mechanism was static by forming a ground state
   complex. Meanwhile, the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (K-SV), binding
   constant (K-b), number of binding sites (n) and thermodynamic parameters
   were obtained. Results showed that the interaction of ZnPc with BSA
   occurred spontaneously via hydrogen bond and van der Waal's force.
   According to Foster's non-radioactive energy transfer theory, the energy
   transfer from BSA to ZnPc occurred with high possibility. Synchronous
   fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectra also demonstrated that

Title = {{Wavelet-Space Correlation Imaging for High-Speed MRI without Motion
   Monitoring or Data Segmentation}},
Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aims to (i) develop a new high-speed MRI approach by
   implementing correlation imaging in wavelet-space, and (ii) demonstrate
   the ability of wavelet-space correlation imaging to image human anatomy
   with involuntary or physiological motion.
   Methods: Correlation imaging is a high-speed MRI framework in which
   image reconstruction relies on quantification of data correlation. The
   presented work integrates correlation imaging with a wavelet transform
   technique developed originally in the field of signal and image
   processing. This provides a new high-speed MRI approach to motion-free
   data collection without motion monitoring or data segmentation. The new
   approach, called ``wavelet-space correlation imaging{''}, is
   investigated in brain imaging with involuntary motion and chest imaging
   with free-breathing.
   Results: Wavelet-space correlation imaging can exceed the speed limit of
   conventional parallel imaging methods. Using this approach with high
   acceleration factors (6 for brain MRI, 16 for cardiac MRI, and 8 for
   lung MRI), motion-free images can be generated in static brain MRI with
   involuntary motion and nonsegmented dynamic cardiac/lung MRI with
   free-breathing.
   Conclusion: Wavelet-space correlation imaging enables highspeed MRI in
   the presence of involuntary motion or physiological dynamics without
   motion monitoring or data segmentation. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Robust image hashing, which maps the perceptual contents of image to a
   short digest, is a key technique for tackling the challenges of
   content-based indexing, searching and copyright protection. In this
   letter, we propose a quaternion invariance based hashing algorithm that
   can fuse complementary visual features to compact hash. The proposed
   algorithm leverages quaternion polar cosine transform to holistically
   capture the spatial and chromatic characteristics of digital image, and
   rotation-invariant features are derived from the phase information in
   the quaternion frequency domain. In addition, we also propose an
   information theoretic based metric for feature quality assessment and a
   greedy strategy to select the optimal subset of features for hash
   computation. Extensive experiments over a large database demonstrate
   that the proposed work shows higher content identification accuracy than
   most competing algorithms, and the resulting hash is compact and easy to
   compute.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidized cellulose can be produced from the oxidation reaction of
   hydrogen peroxide in the degumming process of ramie fibers. In this
   work, the contents of aldehyde and carboxylate groups in ramie cellulose
   which occurred during the degumming process were quantitatively
   determined by the electric conductivity titration method. The
   morphological changes and chemical components of oxidized cellulose were
   characterized using SEM, XRD, and FT-IR. Additionally, the relationship
   between the contents of the oxidized groups and the mechanical
   properties of the degummed fibers were discussed and analyzed. Results
   showed that the presence of aldehyde and carboxylate groups in the
   cellulose contributed significantly to the loss of tenacity, breaking
   elongation, softness, and degree of polymerization of degummed fibers.
   When the aldehyde content varied from 20 to 35 mu mol/g and the
   carboxylate content varied from 140 to 180 mu mol/g, respectively, raw
   fibers could achieve desired and reasonable degumming results. This
   study could offer useful information in obtaining optimal operation
   parameters for ramie oxidation degumming and better control of fiber
   quality. The degree of oxidation and content of oxidized cellulose could
   be used as effective indicating factors to demonstrate oxidation
   degumming efficiency and fiber properties.}},

Abstract = {{Depolymerization of procyanidin polymers into oligomers enhances their
   bioavailability and bioactivity because oligomers are bioavailable.
   Hydrogenolysis was applied in this study to depolymerize hi-tannin
   sorghum bran procyanidin polymers into oligomers. The yield and
   composition of oligomers under different hydrogenolysis conditions was
   investigated. Results showed that raising temperature from 50 to 100
   degrees C significantly increased total yield of oligomers. Higher
   temperatures (150 and 200 degrees C) produced monomers with lower yield.
   The highest yield of oligomers (38.8\%) was obtained using 1 MPa
   hydrogen whereas 3 MPa hydrogen in reaction vessel decreased yield.
   Total yield of oligomers reached the highest at 1-3 h and then decreased
   with prolonged reaction time. Yield increased with palladium-on-carbon
   (Pd/C, a catalyst) amount from 0.5 to 3 mg and plateaued with Pd/C
   amount from 3 to 10 mg. The maximum yield of produced oligomers was
   achieved under 100 degrees C, 1 MPa hydrogen pressure, 1-3 h, and 3-10
   mg Pd/C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution is a major public health
   concern in Hong Kong. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations of
   health risks from ambient PM10 from seven air quality monitoring
   stations between 2000 and 2011 were analyzed. Positive matrix
   factorization (PMF) was adopted to identify major source categories of
   ambient PM10 and quantify their contributions. Afterwards, a
   point-estimated risk model was used to identify the inhalation cancer
   and non-cancer risks of PM10 sources. The long-term trends of the health
   risks from classified local and non-local sources were explored.
   Furthermore, the reason for the increase of health risks during high
   PM10 days was discussed. Results show that vehicle exhaust source was
   the dominant inhalation cancer risk (ICR) contributor (72\%), whereas
   trace metals and vehicle exhaust sources contributed approximately 27\%
   and 21\% of PM10 inhalation non-cancer risk (INCR), respectively. The
   identified local sources accounted for approximately 80\% of the ICR in
   Hong Kong, while contribution percentages of the non-local and local
   sources for INCR are comparable. The clear increase of ICR at high PM
   days was mainly attributed to the increase of contributions from coal
   combustion/biomass burning and secondary sulfate, while the increase of
   INCR at high PM days was attributed to the increase of contributions
   from the sources coal combustion/biomass burning, secondary nitrate, and
   trace metals. This study highlights the importance of health risk-based
   source apportionment in air quality management with protecting human
   health as the ultimate target. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In solar thermal power plant, the thermal energy storage (TES) system is
   a key component which includes thermal energy storage unit, thermal
   energy storage material and heat transfer fluid (HTF). We numerically
   simulate the dynamical thermal performances of shell-tube TES units with
   diverse geometric configurations, phase change materials (PCMs)
   including pure NaNO3 and a composite of NaNO3/expanded graphite (EG),
   and HTFs such as synthetic oil and molten salts. In the
   charging/discharging process, the conjugated heat transfer behavior
   between the thermal storage unit and thermal carriage channel is
   specially concerned. Effects of the extended fin, PCMs and HTFs on
   improving heat performance are examined and quantified with total heat
   flux and effective Nusselt numbers. Together with the presented diagrams
   of PCM phase evolution, the roles of heat conduction and natural
   convection in influencing the thermal behavior of the TES units are
   clearly revealed. The nonuniform phase distribution of PCM due to
   natural convection results in a considerable time spent in the end of
   the charging/discharging processes. The results show that both the full
   melting time and solidification time can be shortened at least 14\%,
   benefited from using the extended fins and the composite. This study is
   expected to provide an apprehensive interpretation of thermal transport
   mechanism and rational advices in optimizing the TES system operation.

Abstract = {{beta-1,3-glucanosyltransferases play essential roles in cell wall
   biosynthesis in yeast. Kluyveromyces lactis has six putative
   beta-1,3-glucanosyltransferase genes. KlGAS1-1 and KlGAS1-2 are homologs
   of Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene GAS1. RT-qPCR indicated the
   transcription level of KlGAS1-1 was significantly reduced while
   heterologous protein (thermostable xylanase B) secretion was enhanced
   during medium optimization. To evaluate if these two events were
   related, and to improve xylanase B secretion in K. lactis, we
   constructed KlGAS1-1 and KlGAS1-2 single deletion strains and double
   deletion strain, respectively. KlGAS1-1 gene deletion resulted in the
   highest xylanase B activity among the three mutants. Only the double
   deletion strain showed morphology similar to that of the GAS1 deletion
   mutant in S. cerevisiae. The two single deletion strains differed in
   terms of cell wall thickness and xylanase B secretion. Transcription
   levels of beta-1,3-glucanosyltransferase genes and genes related to
   protein secretion and transport were assayed. The
   beta-1,3-glucanosyltransferase genes displayed transcription
   complementation in the cell wall synthesis process. KlGAS1-1 and
   KlGAS1-2 affected transcription levels of secretion-and
   transport-related genes. Differences in protein secretion ratio among
   the three deletion strains were associated with changes of transcription
   levels of secretion-and transport-related genes. Our findings indicate
   that KlGAS1-1 deletion is an effective tool for enhancing
   industrial-scale heterologous protein secretion in K. lactis.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, an innovative soft soil improvement method was advanced in
   China by integrating and modifying vacuum consolidation and dynamic
   compaction ground improvement techniques in an intelligent and
   controlled manner. This innovative soft soil improvement method, often
   referred to as ``High Vacuum Densification Method (HVDM){''}, has been
   successfully used in China and Asia for numerous large-scale soft soil
   improvement projects, from which enormous time and cost savings have
   been achieved. In this presentation, the working principles of the HVDM
   are described, followed by a summary of two case studies. Results of
   numerical simulation using FLAC3D computer program, in which dynamic
   compaction is modelled as a three-dimensional, coupled hydro-mechanical
   model, are presented to highlight the mechanisms of positive pore
   pressure generation due to dynamic compaction. Both field studies and
   numerical simulation results support the mechanisms of HVDM in that

Abstract = {{Background: Virtual reality (VR) systems have been proven to increase
   motor performance in stroke and elderly patients. However, the effects
   have not been established in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The
   aim of this study was to examine the effects of VR-based training in
   improving muscle strength, sensory integration ability, and walking
   abilities in patients with PD through a randomized controlled trial.
   Methods: Thirty-six individuals who have been diagnosed with PD were
   randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 12 for each group).
   Participants performed VR-based Wii Fit exercise (VRWii group) or
   traditional exercise (TE group) for 45 minutes, followed by treadmill
   training for another 15 minutes for 12 sessions in 6 weeks. Participants
   in the control group did not undergo the structured exercise program,
   but received fall-prevention education instead. The study outcomes
   included lower extremity muscle strength, sensory integration ability,
   walking velocity, stride length, and functional gait assessment. All
   outcomes were assessed at baseline, after training, and at 1 month
   follow-up.
   Results: Both the VRWii and TE groups showed more improvement in level
   walking velocity, stride length, functional gait assessment, muscle
   strength, and vestibular system integration compared with the control
   group after training and at 1 month follow-up. The VRWii training, but
   not the TE training, resulted in greater improvement in visual system
   integration than the control.
   Conclusion: VRWii training is as beneficial as TE in improving walking
   abilities, sensory integration ability, and muscle strength in patients
   with PD, and such improvements persisted for at least for 1 month. VRWii
   training is thus suggested to be implemented in patients with PD.

Abstract = {{Accurate calculation of equilibrium formation conditions of hydrates is
   important for gas storage and separation based on hydrate technology. In
   this work, the hydrate formation conditions of a synthesized gas mixture
   in tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) aqueous solution were measured
   at temperature ranging from 278.1 to 286.2 K. An inflection point in the
   P-T curve of hydrate phase equilibria was found. It is suggested that
   the hydrate structures transformed from semiclathrate hydrates to pure
   structure I hydrates with an increase in formation temperature. Then a
   thermodynamic model was proposed for calculating formation conditions of
   the semiclathrate hydrates formed from the gas mixtures+TBAB aqueous
   solution. The Patel-Teja equation of state was used to calculate the
   fugacity of gaseous hydrate former and several correlations were used to
   calculate the properties of TBAB. Ethylene molecules are supposed not to
   be able to occupy the dodecahedral small cages in the TBAB semiclathrate
   hydrates under the experimental P-T conditions. The presented model
   results show good agreement with the experimental data and the
   literature data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BAH domain-containing protein 1 (BAHD1) is involved in heterochromatin
   formation and gene repression in human cells. BAHD1 also localizes to
   the inactive X chromosome (Xi), but the functional significance of this
   targeting is unknown. So far, research on this protein has been hampered
   by its low endogenous abundance and its role in epigenetic regulation
   remains poorly explored. In this work, we used whole-genome bisulfite
   sequencing (BS-seq) to compare the DNA methylation profile of HEK293
   cells expressing low levels of BAHD1 (HEK-CT) to that of isogenic cells
   stably overexpressing BAHD1 (HEK-BAHD1). We show that increasing BAHD1
   levels induces de novo DNA methylation on autosomes and a marked
   hypomethylation on the X chromosome (chrX). We identified 91,358 regions
   that have different methylation patterns in HEK-BAHD1 compared to HEK-CT
   cells (termed ``BAHD1-DMRs{''}), of which 83,850 mapped on autosomes and
   7508 on the X chromosome (chrX). Autosomal BAHD1-DMRs were predominantly
   hypermethylated and located to satellites, interspersed repeats, and
   intergenic regions. In contrast, BAHD1-DMRs on chrX were mainly
   hypomethylated and located to gene bodies and enhancers. We further
   found that BAHD1-DMRs display a higher-order organization by being
   clustered within large chromosomal domains. Half of these
   ``BAHD1-Associated differentially methylated Domains{''} (BADs)
   overlapped with lamina-associated domains (LADs). Based on these
   results, we propose that BAHD1-mediated heterochromatin formation is
   linked to DNA methylation and may play a role in the spatial
   architecture of the genome.}},

Abstract = {{Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) release granule proteins as the
   first line of defense against bacteria and set up chemotactic gradients
   that result in monocyte infiltration to the site of injury. Although
   well established, the role of biomaterials in regulating adherent PMN
   degranulation and subsequent PMN-monocyte paracrine interactions is less
   clear. The aim of this study was to determine how biomaterials affect
   the degranulation of selected biomarkers and downstream monocyte
   adhesion and transendothelial migration. Poly(ethylene glycol)
   (PEG)-containing hydrogels (PEG and an interpenetrating network of PEG
   and gelatin) promote the release of the -defensins human neutrophil
   peptides 1-3, but not azurocidin or monocyte chemotactic protein-1.
   Although human neutrophil peptides 1-3 are monocyte chemoattractants, no
   subsequent effects on monocyte transmigration are observed in static
   conditions. Under flow conditions, monocyte adhesion on human umbilical
   vein endothelial cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor- is
   elevated in the presence of granule proteins from PMNs adherent on
   polydimethylsiloxane, but not from PMNs cultured on PEG hydrogels. These
   results suggest that PEG promotes PMN antimicrobial capacity without
   enhanced monocyte recruitment. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Abstract = {{The 2013 volume Old Testament Pseudepigrapha: More Noncanonical
   Scriptures, edited by Richard Bauckham, James R. Davila and Alexander

   Exploring two entries in the volume, `The Book of Noah' and `The Story

   this article demonstrates how privileging the early `work' as the

Abstract = {{The number of fluorophores within a molecule complex can be revealed by
   single-molecule photobleaching imaging. A widely applied strategy to
   analyze intensity traces over time is the quantification of
   photobleaching step counts. However, several factors can limit and bias
   the detection of photobleaching steps, including noise, high numbers of
   fluorophores, and the possibility that several photobleaching events
   occur almost simultaneously. In this study, we propose a new approach,
   to our knowledge, to determine the fluorophore number that correlates
   the intensity decay of a population of molecule complexes with the decay
   of the number of visible complexes. We validated our approach using
   single and fourfold Atto-labeled DNA strands. As an example we estimated
   the subunit stoichiometry of soluble CD95L using GFP fusion proteins. To
   assess the precision of our method we performed in silico experiments
   showing that the estimates are not biased for experimentally observed
   intensity fluctuations and that the relative precision remains constant
   with increasing number of fluorophores. In case of fractional
   fluorescent labeling, our simulations predicted that the fluorophore
   number estimate corresponds to the product of the true fluorophore
   number with the labeling fraction. Our method, denoted by spot number
   and intensity correlation (SONIC), is fully automated, robust to noise,
   and does not require the counting of photobleaching events.}},

Abstract = {{Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) is a specific receptor for microbial
   flagellin and is one of the most well-known receptors in the TLR family.
   We reported previously that TLR5 signaling is well maintained during
   aging and that caveolin-1 may be involved in TLR5 signaling in aged
   macrophages through direct interactions. Therefore, it is important to
   clarify whether caveolin-1/TLR5 interactions affect TLR5 expression
   during aging. To assess the effect of caveolin-1 on TLR5, we analyzed
   TLR5 expression in senescent fibroblasts and aged tissues expressing
   high levels of caveolin-1. As expected, TLR5 mRNA and protein expression
   was well maintained in senescent fibroblasts and aged tissues, whereas
   TLR4 mRNA and protein were diminished in those cells and tissues. To
   determine the mechanism of caveolin-1-dependent TLR5 expression, we
   examined TLR5 expression in caveolin-1 deficient mice. Interestingly,
   TLR5 mRNA and protein levels were decreased dramatically in tissues from
   caveolin-1 knockout mice. Moreover, overexpressed caveolin-1 in vitro
   enhanced TLR5 mRNA through the MAPK pathway and prolonged TLR5 protein
   half-life through direct interaction. These results suggest that
   caveolin-1 may play a crucial role in maintaining of TLR5 by regulating
   transcription systems and increasing protein half-life.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the widespread use of Orton-Gillingham (OG) based approaches to
   dyslexia remediation, empirical support documenting its effectiveness is
   lacking. Recently, Chia and Houghton demonstrated the effectiveness of
   the OG approach for remediation of dyslexia in Singapore. As a
   conceptual replication and extension of that research, we report results
   of 39 students with dyslexia aged between six and 14 years enrolled in
   an OG intervention programme over a period of one year in a
   single-subject research (pre-test/post-test) design. Analyses of
   variance showed that students significantly improved in standardised
   tests of reading and spelling with moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d =
   0.52-0.58). Additionally, an inverse relationship was found between
   students' ages when they began intervention and gains made during the
   intervention. Results thus indicate the effectiveness of an OG approach
   in remediating literacy difficulties in students with dyslexia and,
   taken together with previous studies, further suggest the importance of
   early identification and intervention.}},

Journal = {{ASIA LIFE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sensor nodes which are randomly deployed in inaccessible terrains or
   disaster relief operations compose wireless sensor networks for
   gathering data. They send the gathered data to the sink which is located
   far away. Since their power sources are either battery or
   non-rechargeable, they must at least operate for a given mission time or
   as long as possible in order to send the gathered data to the sink.
   Therefore, in WSNs, prolonging the network lifetime via a more effective
   use of energy is the major challenge. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering
   Hierarchy (LEACH) is one of an energy efficient algorithms in WSNs. In
   LEACH, the role of being a cluster header is decided by a probability.
   This means that cluster headers can be concentrated at some regions in
   the network field thereby, non-header nodes which are far away from
   cluster headers need to consume more energy for sending data. This will
   be a cause of the sensor fault and the lifetime of the whole network
   will be reduced. The goal of this study was to perform an
   energy-efficient data gathering via the hierarchical strips based
   division of the network field in order to resolve this problem. Through
   the simulation results, we proved that the present proposal has good
   performances in terms of the network lifetime and energy efficiency
   compared to LEACH.}},

Abstract = {{The paper examines Malaysian and Singaporean state policies and examples
   of literary works that directly or indirectly address the position of
   English to analyse some of the discursive contradictions and tensions
   undergirding the use of English in their societies. Contention over the
   role of English, rejected as a colonial threat to national identity
   constructed as essentialist Malay monolingualism - has historically and
   continuously riven state, public and literary policies and discourse in
   Malaysia. Ee Tiang Hong's early work articulates the dilemma of the
   Malaysian Anglophone poet whose voice is critiqued as mimicry of
   ``foreign{''} tongues. Muhammad Haji Salleh emerged as an elite Malay
   intellectual with his unnuanced disavowal of English use in Malaysia as
   a dark psychological depredation of the national soul. This total
   English language rejection, however, is called into question and
   undermined by his later bilingual practice of dual Malay and English
   publications of his work and his praise for the two language rivers that
   compose him as a single poet-subject. English is now viewed as an
   instrumental language necessary for competing in the global economy. In
   Singapore, where this instrumentalist language policy remains
   uncontested, the state has positioned Singlish, the local variation of
   English that serves as a major expressive marker of Singaporean
   identity, as a threat to global economic ambitions.}},

   increased cooking loss and decreased hardness, tenderness and juiciness
   (p<0.05). Glasswort hydrate containing non-meat ingredient improved
   cooking loss, water holding capacity, emulsion stability, hardness, and
   viscosity of reduced-salt, reduced-fat frankfurters. The GM treatment
   had the highest myofibiliar protein solubility among all treatments,

Abstract = {{Pathologic evaluation of the appendix after appendectomy is routine and
   can occasionally identify unexpected findings. The aim of the present
   study was to determine the incidence and type of pathologic diagnoses
   found in appendectomy specimens at our institution. The
   clinicopathological data of 1627 patients who underwent appendectomies
   for presumed acute appendicitis from January 2008 to October 2014 were
   reviewed retrospectively. There were 986 men and 641 women (sex ratio
   M/F= 1.5) aged between 16 months and 90 years (mean= 30 years). All
   patients underwent appendectomy (either open or laparoscopic).
   Histological examination of the surgical specimen showed acute
   inflammation of the appendix in 1455 cases (89.42 \%), fibrosed appendix
   in 37 cases (2.27 \%), and Enterobius vermicularis (n= 23). In 101 cases
   (6.2 \%), the appendix was histologically normal. Incidental unexpected
   pathological diagnoses were noted in 57 appendectomy specimens. They
   included pinworm (n= 23), mucinous neoplasms (n= 12), neuroendocrine
   tumors (NET) (n= 8), adenocarcinoma (n= 2), granulomatous inflammation
   (n= 5), tuberculosis (n= 2), hyperplastic polyp (n= 1), tubular adenoma
   (n= 1), diverticulitis (n= 1), endometriosis (n= 1), and actinomycosis
   (n= 1). The routine histopathological examination of the appendix is of
   value for identifying unsuspected conditions requiring further
   postoperative management. Gross examination alone does not appear to be
   a good indicator of an unexpected finding on microscopic exam. It is
   recommended that in order to avoid misdiagnoses, all appendices should
   be histopathologically examined.}},

Abstract = {{The northeastern convergence of the Philippine Sea plate toward the
   Eurasian plate causes the major western Philippine Sea plate boundary to
   subduct toward the northwest or west directions. However, this
   phenomenon is not clearly observed along the plate boundary between
   Luzon and Taiwan. Careful examination of deep seismicity in the southern
   Taiwan area from the earthquake catalog reported by the Central Weather
   Bureau shows two seismic zones dipping toward the opposing directions.
   The first dips toward the east from the surface down to 150 km in depth,
   while the second dips westward at depths between 150 and 200 km. These
   two seismic zones are confirmed further by seismogram observation and
   modeling results generated by two deep faults in the southern Taiwan
   area. The eastward seismic zone clearly results from the Eurasia plate
   subduction along the Manila trench, while a small section of the
   westward seismic zone might likely be a residual slab from the ancient
   subducted Philippine Sea plate. Based on the subduction speed obtained
   from GPS observations and the subducted Eurasian plate geometry, we can
   further estimate the eastward Eurasian plate subduction started at least
   3.35 million years ago. This result is roughly consistent with the
   volcanic ages (3 - 4 Ma) observed in the arc between Luzon and Taiwan.}},

Title = {{Bimodal Biometric Verification Using the Fusion of Palmprint and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a reliable and robust biometric verification
   method based on bimodal physiological characteristics of palms,
   including the palmprint and palm-dorsum vein patterns. The proposed
   method consists of five steps: (1) automatically aligning and cropping
   the same region of interest from different palm or palm-dorsum images;
   (2) applying the digital wavelet transform and inverse wavelet transform
   to fuse palmprint and vein pattern images; (3) extracting the line-like
   features (LLFs) from the fused image; (4) obtaining multiresolution
   representations of the LLFs by using a multiresolution filter; and (5)
   using a support vector machine to verify the multiresolution
   representations of the LLFs. The proposed method possesses four
   advantages: first, both modal images are captured in peg-free scenarios
   to improve the user-friendliness of the verification device. Second,
   palmprint and vein pattern images are captured using a low-resolution
   digital scanner and infrared (IR) camera. The use of low-resolution
   images results in a smaller database. In addition, the vein pattern
   images are captured through the invisible IR spectrum, which improves
   antispoofing. Third, since the physiological characteristics of
   palmprint and vein pattern images are different, a hybrid fusing rule
   can be introduced to fuse the decomposition coefficients of different
   bands. The proposed method fuses decomposition coefficients at different
   decomposed levels, with different image sizes, captured from different
   sensor devices. Finally, the proposed method operates automatically and
   hence no parameters need to be set manually. Three thousand palmprint
   images and 3000 vein pattern images were collected from 100 volunteers
   to verify the validity of the proposed method. The results show a false
   rejection rate of 1.20\% and a false acceptance rate of 1.56\%. It
   demonstrates the validity and excellent performance of our proposed
   method comparing to other methods.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Silk fibroin (SF), which has been used as an analogue of the silk-like
   proteins in studying the biomineralization process of calcium carbonate
   in vitro, shows a high preference for the formation of aragonite
   polymorph. In this study, Fe3+, which has been found with relatively
   high levels in the shells of marine mollusks, was introduced into the
   SF-regulated biomineralization system. The addition of Fe3+ into the SF
   aqueous solutions induced a conformational transition of SF from random
   coil to beta-sheet. The promoted beta-sheet structures provided
   Ca2+-binding sites for SF and, accordingly, enabled the formation of an
   amorphous calcium carbonate precursor. Such a precursor has an aligned
   parallel structure and acts as a template for the direct growth of
   aragonite. The corresponding aragonite products showed similar organic
   inorganic hierarchical structure to nacre building in vivo as well as
   higher thermal stability compared with that of the other Fe3+-free
   aragonite products in terms of the polymorph. It is indicated that Fe3+
   plays multiple roles in this nacre-mimetic biomineralization process. By
   examining the coeffect of SF and Fe3+ as multiple additives, this study
   has provided a deeper understanding on the valuable contribution of Fe3+
   in the nacre-mimetic system, which could facilitate the fabrication of
   similar synthetic materials with good mechanical performance from cheap
   abundant materials.}},

Abstract = {{To upgrade Hefei Light Source (HLS) Linac, eight accelerating units have

   Each of the units consists of two 3-m accelerators driven by one
   klystron. The input cavity detuning method was developed to measure and
   correct the phase length of the RF power distribution waveguide system.
   The design of the waveguide network and the principles of the detuning
   method are presented in this paper. After correction, the phase error
   between the waveguide of the two accelerators was less than +/- 0.5
   degrees, and the maximum electron energy of Linac reached 805 MeV, which
   is very near the theoretical maximum value of 810 MeV. These results
   demonstrate that the calibration of the waveguide was successful.}},

Abstract = {{Protein characterization is a necessary activity during development,
   technical transfers, and licensure. One important aspect of protein
   characterization is higher order structure assessment, which can be
   accomplished in a variety of ways. Circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies provide global higher order
   structure and are routinely used to measure the overall structure for
   product characterization; however, their use as comparability tools is
   uncertain because of their insensitivity to local or small structure
   changes. We use a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to explore the usefulness of
   CD and FTIR compared with other indirect methods of structure
   characterization such as size-exclusion and ion-exchange
   chromatographies (SEC and IEC). A panel of degraded samples of a mAb was
   generated; their higher order structure evaluated using CD and FTIR and
   was found to be largely unchanged. However, the SEC and IEC
   chromatograms of certain degraded samples were found to have measurable
   changes. Based on these studies, we conclude that the application of CD
   and FTIR should be reserved for global higher order structure
   identification or product characterization only. The use of CD or FTIR
   comparability of mAbs should be carefully evaluated, as comparability
   can be sensitively determined using indirect methods based on
   chromatography. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{8731-8744}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of dry stack masonry (DSM) is influenced by the interaction
   of the infill with the frame (especially the joints between bricks),
   which requires further research. This study investigates the compression
   and shear behaviors of DSM. First, a series of compression tests were
   carried out on both masonry prism with mortar (MP\_m) and DSM prism
   (MP\_ds). The failure mode of each prism was determined. Different from
   the MP\_m, the stress-strain relationship of the MP\_ds was
   characterized by an upward concavity at the initial stage. The
   compression strength of the MP\_ds was slightly reduced by 15\%, while
   the elastic modulus was reduced by over 62\%. In addition, 36
   shear-compression tests were carried out under cyclic loads to emphasize
   the influence of various loads on the shear-compression behavior of DSM.
   The results showed that the Mohr-Coulomb friction law adequately
   represents the failure of dry joints at moderate stress levels, and the
   varying friction coefficients under different load amplitudes cannot be
   neglected. The experimental setup and results are valuable for further
   research.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates strategic interactions in airport privatization
   by two countries. Each country has a (gateway) hub and a local airport.
   In each country, a hub carrier operates hub-local and international
   hub-hub flights, whereas a regional carrier operates hub-local flights
   and forms an alliance with the foreign hub carrier. Previous studies
   considered a limited network with a (hub) airport per country and showed
   that privatizing the hub is generally the dominant strategy. By
   contrast, in our more general network, privatizing the hub (alone or
   along with the local airport) could be one of the equilibria only if the
   international hub-hub market is sufficiently large. If the hub-hub
   market is relatively large, governments have an incentive to privatize
   both their hub and local airports to a single operator on the condition
   that the operator is allowed to cross subsidize. We further find that
   governments may be trapped in a Prisoners' Dilemma. (C)) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Due to the proliferation of disciplines employing fluoroscopy as their
   primary imaging tool and the prolonged extensive use of fluoroscopy in
   interventional and cardiovascular angiography procedures,
   ``dose-area-product{''} ( DAP) meters were installed to monitor and
   record the radiation dose delivered to patients. In some cases, the
   radiation dose or the output value is calculated, rather than measured,
   using the pertinent radiological parameters and geometrical information.
   The AAPM Task Group 190 (TG-190) was established to evaluate the
   accuracy of the DAP meter in 2008. Since then, the term ``DAP-meter{''}
   has been revised to air kerma-area product (KAP) meter. The charge of TG
   190 (Accuracy and Calibration of Integrated Radiation Output Indicators
   in Diagnostic Radiology) has also been realigned to investigate the
   ``Accuracy and Calibration of Integrated Radiation Output Indicators{''}
   which is reflected in the title of the task group, to include situations
   where the KAP may be acquired with or without the presence of a physical
   ``meter.{''} To accomplish this goal, validation test protocols were
   developed to compare the displayed radiation output value to an external
   measurement. These test protocols were applied to a number of clinical
   systems to collect information on the accuracy of dose display values in
   the field. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Title = {{Differential requirements for H/ACA ribonucleoprotein components in cell
   proliferation and response to DNA damage}},

Abstract = {{H/ACA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are comprised of four conserved
   proteins, dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, and GAR1, and a function-specifying,
   noncoding H/ACA RNA. H/ACA RNPs contribute to telomerase assembly and
   stabilization, and posttranscriptional processing of nascent ribosomal
   RNA and spliceosomal RNA. However, very little is known about the
   coordinated action of the four proteins in other biologic processes. As
   described herein, we observed a differential requirement for the
   proteins in cell proliferation and identified a possible reliance for
   these factors in regulation of specific DNA damage biomarkers. In
   particular, GAR1 expression was upregulated following exposure to all
   forms of genotoxic stress tested. In contrast, levels of the other
   proteins were either reduced or unaffected. Only GAR1 showed an altered
   subcellular localization with a shift from the nucleolus to the
   nucleoplasm after ultraviolet-C irradiation and doxorubicin treatments.
   Transient siRNA-mediated depletion of GAR1 and dyskerin arrested cell
   proliferation, whereas loss of either NHP2 or NOP10 had no effect.
   Finally, loss of dyskerin, GAR1, NHP2, and NOP10, respectively, limited
   the accumulation of DNA damage biomarkers. However, the individual
   responses were dependent upon the specific type of damage incurred. In
   general, loss of GAR1 had the most suppressive effect on the biomarkers
   tested. Since the specific responses to genotoxic stress, the
   contribution of each protein to cell proliferation, and the activation
   of DNA damage biomarkers were not equivalent, this suggests the
   possibility that at least some of the proteins, most notably GAR1, may
   potentially function independently of their respective roles within
   H/ACA RNP complexes.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Background: High prevalence rates of delirium have been found in
   intensive care units (ICUs), ranging from 20\% to 80\%. The development
   of delirium may prolong length of stay, impair cognition, and result in
   placement in a nursing home for thepatient.
   Purpose: There is a lack of research focused on the aging population, so
   the purpose of this study was to establish the incidence rate of
   delirium among ICU elderly patients and to identify its risk factors.
   Methods: An observational design with repeated measures was used.
   Subjects older than 65 years who had been admitted to the ICU within 24
   hours were recruited. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive
   Care Unit and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale were used twice a day to
   identify subjects experiencing delirium by RA. The demographic data,
   history of illness, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II
   scores, and laboratory data of the participants were recorded.
   Results: Ninety participants were included from a medical ICU. The
   incidence rate of delirium was 75.6\% (n = 68). Average age was 78.28
   7.6 years; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores
   ranged from 7 to 35. Most participants were diagnosed with respiratory
   failure (73.3\%), and 86.76\% of participantsdeveloped delirium within
   24 hours. The most frequently experienced type of delirium was the mixed
   subtype (47.05\%); the second most frequently experienced was hypoactive
   next. The risk factors were analyzed using logistic regression. The
   numberof anesthetic analgesics used, total number of medications
   prescribed, duration of dehydration, use of corticosteroids before
   admissions, and shock were identified and explained 31.3\% of variance.
   Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Delirium is a severe problem
   among elderly patients in the ICU. Healthcare professionals should pay
   more attention to elderly patients at greater risk for experiencing
   delirium.}},

Abstract = {{Apoptosis is the major cause of death of insulin-producing beta-cells in
   type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Klotho is a recently discovered
   antiaging gene. We found that the Klotho gene is expressed in pancreatic
   beta-cells. Interestingly, halplodeficiency of Klotho (KL+/-)
   exacerbated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes (a model of T1DM),
   including hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, diminished islet insulin
   storage, and increased apoptotic beta-cells. Conversely, in vivo
   beta-cell-specific expression of mouse Klotho gene (mKL) attenuated
   beta-cell apoptosis and prevented STZ-induced diabetes. mKL promoted
   cell adhesion to collagen IV, increased FAK and Akt phosphorylation, and
   inhibited caspase 3 cleavage in cultured MIN6 beta-cells. mKL abolished
   STZ- and TNF alpha-induced inhibition of FAK and Akt phosphorylation,
   caspase 3 cleavage, and beta-cell apoptosis. These promoting effects of
   Klotho can be abolished by blocking integrin beta 1. Therefore, these
   cell-based studies indicated that Klotho protected beta-cells by
   inhibiting beta-cell apoptosis through activation of the integrin beta
   1-FAK/Akt pathway, leading to inhibition of caspase 3 cleavage. In an
   autoimmune T1DM model (NOD), we showed that in vivo beta-cell-specific
   expression of mKL improved glucose tolerance, attenuated beta-cell
   apoptosis, enhanced insulin storage in beta-cells, and increased plasma
   insulin levels. The beneficial effect of Klotho gene delivery is likely
   due to attenuation of T-cell infiltration in pancreatic islets in NOD
   mice. Overall, our results demonstrate for the first time that Klotho
   protected beta-cells in T1DM via attenuating apoptosis.}},

Abstract = {{There is ample evidence that methane (CH4) emissions from natural
   wetlands exhibit large spatial variations at a field scale. However,
   little is known about the metabolically active methanogens mediating
   these differences. We explored the spatial patterns in active
   methanogens of summer inundated Calamagrostis angustifolia marsh with
   low CH4 emissions and permanently inundated Carex lasiocarpa marsh with
   high CH4 emissions in Sanjiang Plain, China. In C. angustifolia marsh,
   the addition of C-13-acetate significantly increased the CH4 production
   rate, and Methanosarcinaceae methanogens were found to participate in
   the consumption of acetate. In C. lasiocarpa marsh, there was no
   apparent increase in the CH4 production rate and no methanogen species
   were labeled with C-13. When (CO2)-C-13-H-2 was added, however, CH4
   production was found to be due to Fen Cluster (Methanomicrobiales) in C.
   angustifolia marsh and Methanobacterium Cluster B (Methanobacteriaceae)
   together with Fen Cluster in C. lasiocarpa marsh. These results
   suggested that CH4 was produced primarily by hydrogenotrophic
   methanogens using substrates mainly derived from plant litter in C.
   lasiocarpa marsh and by both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic
   methanogens using substrates mainly derived from root exudate in C.
   angustifolia marsh. The significantly lower CH4 emissions measured in
   situ in C. angustifolia marsh was primarily due to a deficiency of
   substrates compared to C. lasiocarpa marsh. Therefore, we speculate that
   the substrate source regulates both the type of active methanogens and
   the CH4 production pathway and consequently contributes to the spatial
   variations in CH4 productions observed in these freshwater marshes.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclophilin A (Cyp A), a member of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPI)
   family, may function as a molecular signalling switch. Comparative
   proteomic studies have identified Cyp A as a potential downstream target
   of protein kinase B (Akt). This study confirmed that Cyp A is a
   downstream effector of the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
   signalling pathway. Cyp A was highly phosphorylated in response to
   interleukin-6 treatment, which was consistent with the accumulation of
   phosphorylated Akt, suggesting that Cyp A is a phosphorylation target of
   Akt and downstream effector of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Cyclosporine A
   (CsA), a PPI inhibitor, inhibited the growth of multiple myeloma (MM)
   U266 cells. Moreover, CsA treatment inhibited the activation of the
   signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in MM U266
   cells. Several Cyp A mutants were generated. Mutants with mutated AKT
   phosphorylation sites increased the G1 phase arrest in MM U266 cells.
   The other mutants that mimicked the phosphorylated state of Cyp A
   decreased the percentage of G1 phase. These results demonstrated that
   the states of phosphorylation of Cyp A by Akt can influence the progress
   of the cell cycle in MM U266 cells and that this effect is probably
   mediated through the Janus-activated kinase 2/STAT3 signalling pathway.

   such as spin coating are not available. Especially for membrane
   applications, where the processing of CMP as thin films is desirable,
   the processing problems have hindered their commercial application.
   Here we describe the interfacial synthesis of CMP thin films on
   functionalized substrates via molecular layer-by-layer (l-b-l)
   synthesis. This process allows the preparation of films with desired
   thickness and composition and even desired composition gradients.
   The use of sacrificial supports allows the preparation of freestanding
   membranes by dissolution of the support after the synthesis. To handle
   such ultra-thin freestanding membranes the protection with sacrificial
   coatings showed great promise, to avoid rupture of the nanomembranes. To
   transfer the nanomembranes to the desired substrate, the coated
   membranes are upfloated at the air-liquid interface and then transferred
   via dip coating.}},

Abstract = {{Scholarship on the 1970s women's movement' in the USA has grown in
   recent years. However, this area has yet to fully incorporate women's
   athletic experiences. This paper brings together these two areas of
   scholarship through analysis of women's experiences playing professional
   football in 1970s America. Women athletes articulated little connection
   between football and the larger feminist campaign for corporeal autonomy
   and equality and some pronounced a distinctly antifeminist identity. My
   intent is not to force the feminist mantle on these women or to contest
   their self-descriptions. Rather, I seek to locate their experiences
   within the larger women's movement using historian Anne Enke's idea of
   contested space' (Finding the Movement, 2007). Drawing on interviews
   with 13 women on three different teams during the 1970s, I argue that
   while women football players did not explicitly align with the feminist
   movement, they were a part of the larger revolution in women's social
   rank. Football players fought for the freedom to be physically active in
   public, and to gain all of the positive attributes that sport can offer.
   It is therefore imperative that we take seriously women's sporting
   participation and locate it within the broader social context of the
   1970s.}},

Abstract = {{Creating a mental image of one's own performance, observing someone else
   performing an action, and viewing a photograph of a completed action all
   can lead to the illusory recollection that one has performed this
   action. While there are fundamental differences in the nature of these
   three processes, they are aligned by the fact that they involve
   primarily or solely the visual modality. According to the
   source-monitoring framework, the corresponding visual memory traces
   later can be mistakenly attributed to self-performance. However, when
   people perform actions, they do not only engage vision, but also other
   modalities, such as auditory and tactile systems. The present study
   focused on the role of audition in the creation of false beliefs about
   performing an action and explored whether auditory cues alone-in the
   absence of any visual cues-can induce false beliefs and memories for
   actions. After performing a series of simple actions, participants
   listened to the sound of someone performing various actions, watched
   someone perform the actions, or simultaneously both heard and saw
   someone perform them. Some of these actions had been performed earlier
   by the participants and others were new. A later source-memory test
   revealed that all three types of processing (hearing, seeing, or hearing
   plus seeing someone perform the actions) led to comparable increases in
   false claims of having performed actions oneself. The potential
   mechanisms underlying false action-memories from sound and vision are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the impact of trade openness on CO2 emissions
   using time series data over the period of 1970QI-2011QIV for Malaysia.
   We disintegrate the trade effect into scale, technique, composition, and
   comparative advantage effects to check the environmental consequence of
   trade at four different transition points. To achieve the purpose, we
   have employed augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP)
   unit root tests in order to examine the stationary properties of the
   variables. Later, the long-run association among the variables is
   examined by applying autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds
   testing approach to cointegration. Our results confirm the presence of
   cointegration. Further, we find that scale effect has positive and
   technique effect has negative impact on CO2 emissions after threshold
   income level and form inverted U-shaped relationship-hence validates the
   environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. Energy consumption adds in CO2
   emissions. Trade openness and composite effect improve environmental
   quality by lowering CO2 emissions. The comparative advantage effect
   increases CO2 emissions and impairs environmental quality. The results
   provide the innovative approach to see the impact of trade openness in
   four sub-dimensions of trade liberalization. Hence, this study
   attributes more comprehensive policy tool for trade economists to better
   design environmentally sustainable trade rules and agreements.}},

Abstract = {{The representation of transient air-sea interactions is critical to the
   prediction of the sea surface temperature diurnal cycle and daily
   variability. This study develops a multilevel upper ocean model to more
   realistically resolve these interactions. The model is based on the
   one-dimensional turbulence kinetic energy closure developed by Noh et
   al. {[}2011], and incorporates new numerical techniques and improved
   schemes for model physics. The primary improvements include: (1) a
   surface momentum flux penetration scheme to better depict velocity shear
   in the diurnal mixed layer; (2) a solar penetration scheme to improve
   the penetration of visible and near-infrared bands of solar radiation
   into the mixed layer ocean; (3) a scheme to resolve the cool-skin and
   warm-layer effects on sea skin temperature; (4) a vertical grid stretch
   scheme to achieve higher near-surface resolution with fewer vertical
   levels; (5) a trapezoidal time integration scheme for flexible time
   steps; (6) a relaxation term of the previous daily mean difference
   between observed and modeled sea surface temperature. According to the
   numerical experiments based on the TOGA-COARE IMET mooring buoy data and
   the validation by observations from the National Data Buoy Center, NOAA,
   the results indicate that the new upper ocean mixed layer model improves
   the simulation of the diurnal cycle of SST and sea skin temperature,
   especially in amplitude.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical compositions of relatively young mare lava flows have
   implications for the late volcanism on the Moon. Here we report the
   composition of soil along the rim of a 450-m diameter fresh crater at
   the Chang'e-3 (CE-3) landing site, investigated by the Yutu rover with
   in situ APXS (Active Particle-induced X-ray Spectrometer) and VNIS
   (Visible and Near-infrared Imaging Spectrometer) measurements. Results
   indicate that this region's composition differs from other mare
   sample-return sites and is a new type of mare basalt not previously
   sampled, but consistent with remote sensing. The CE-3 regolith derived
   from olivine-normative basaltic rocks with high FeO/(FeO+MgO).
   Deconvolution of the VNIS data indicates abundant high-Ca ferropyroxene
   (augite and pigeonite) plus Fe-rich olivine. We infer from the regolith
   composition that the basaltic source rocks formed during late-stage
   magma-ocean differentiation when dense ferropyroxene-ilmenite cumulates
   sank and mixed with deeper, relatively ferroan olivine and orthopyroxene
   in a hybridized mantle source.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and testing of a methodology to
   assess water vulnerability and stress called ``Water Sustainability
   through Decision Analysis.{''} This method uses multicriteria decision
   analysis to measure water sustainability through a multidisciplinary
   lense and includes measures of water availability, demand, and policy.
   Assessing water sustainability is ultimately a decision problem that
   involves multiple stakeholders and perspectives. Uncertainty is an
   important and often-overlooked aspect of water sustainability. To fill
   this critical knowledge gap, the water sustainability through decision
   analysis method accounts for the uncertainty in the input data and
   unknown decision-maker preferences using stochastic multicriteria
   decision analysis. Addressing the problem of uncertainty helps to
   calculate risk and bypasses the problem of unknown decision maker
   preferences without resorting to equal or arbitrary weights for measures
   of sustainability. The method is applied to eight states in the
   southeastern United States. Georgia ranked high in water sustainability
   and Texas ranked low. The results provide a single outranking index and
   also highlight actionable items that can improve each state's water
   sustainability. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is the application and evaluation of a new
   computer model used for the quantification of emissions coming from
   natural sources. The Natural Emissions Model (NEMO) is driven by the
   meteorological data of the mesoscale numerical Weather Research and
   Forecasting (WRF) model and it estimates particulate matter (PM)
   emissions from windblown dust, sea salt aerosols (SSA) and primary
   biological aerosol particles (PBAPs). It also includes emissions from
   Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) from vegetation; however,
   this study focuses only on particle emissions. An application and
   evaluation of NEMO at European scale are presented. NEMO and the
   modelling system consisted of WRF model and the Comprehensive Air
   Quality Model with extensions (CAMx) were applied in a 30 km European
   domain for the year 2009. The computed domain-wide annual PM10 emissions
   from windblown dust, sea salt and PBAPs were 0.57 Tg, 20 Tg and 0.12 Tg,
   respectively. PM2.5 represented 6\% and 33\% of emitted windblown dust
   and sea salt, respectively. Natural emissions are characterized by high
   geographical and seasonal variations; windblown dust emissions were the
   highest during summer in the southern Europe and SSA production was the
   highest in Atlantic Ocean during the cold season while in Mediterranean
   Sea the highest SSA emissions were found over the Aegean Sea during
   summer. Modelled concentrations were compared with surface station
   measurements and showed that the model captured fairly well the
   contribution of the natural sources to PM levels over Europe. Dust
   concentrations correlated better when dust transport events from Sahara
   desert were absent while the simulation of sea salt episodes led to an
   improvement of model performance during the cold season. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: Mutations in Surfactant Protein C (SFTPC) can lead to
   fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) with variable phenotypes,
   especially in children. The sources of phenotype variability are
   incompletely understood. A common MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950 is
   associated with adult Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). We examined
   whether MUC5B is similarly linked to ILD secondary to SFTPC mutations.
   Methods: MUC5B concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was
   measured in six pediatric patients with SFTPC mutations and diseased
   controls. Immunohistochemical localization of MUC5B was studied in fixed
   lung tissues in patients with SFTPC mutations, ABCA3 mutations, and
   controls. Genotyping for the MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950 was
   attempted in all samples. Results: MUC5B glycoprotein was increased in
   BALF of patients with SFTPC mutations compared to diseased controls (P =
   0.04). MUC5B was unexpectedly present in cells morphologically
   consistent with alveolar epithelial type II cells in patients with SFTPC
   mutations in the BRICHOS domain. Genotyping for the MUC5B promoter
   variant was successful in 18/27 patients, and there was no significant
   relationship between the MUC5B promoter variant and the BALF or MUC5B
   localization. Conclusion: MUC5B may play a role in the development of
   fibrosis in patients with SFTPC mutations, especially in patients with
   BRICHOS mutations. Understanding the role of MUC5B in adult and
   pediatric lung diseases may lead to a better understanding of the
   etiology of fibrotic lung disease as well as development of novel
   therapies. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of
   the methods proposed to conduct a full randomized clinical trial to
   assess the effectiveness of mobilization with movement on shoulder
   functionality in older adults with shoulder dysfunction.
   Methods: A pilot, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial was carried
   out with 44 older adults (83.9 +/- 8.2 years) with shoulder dysfunction
   in 3 nursing homes in Toledo, Spain. Participants were recruited through
   information sessions and were randomly allocated into 2 groups. The
   control group (n = 22) intervention consisted of a physical therapy
   standard protocol proposed by the Spanish Rheumatology Society.
   Techniques based on Mulligan's concepts of mobilization with movement
   were added to the standard protocol for the experimental group (n = 22)
   intervention. Interventions took place 3 times a week for 2 consecutive
   weeks and were performed by 2 experienced therapists. Main outcomes were
   recruitment rates, participation and adherence to interventions,
   assessment procedures, and the implementation of mobilization with
   movement. Clinical outcomes were shoulder functionality, active
   glenohumeral range of motion, and pain intensity. Data were collected at
   baseline, after each group intervention, and at 1 and 3 months after
   finishing interventions.
   Results: All the participants accepted to be randomized. Participation
   rates were 97.7\% for the experimental group and 95.5\% for the control
   group. The analysis of variance did not show any statistically
   significant difference between treatment groups for any of the variables
   (all P values for the group effect were greater than .36) or a change of
   the difference between groups over time (all P values for the
   time-treatment interactions were greater than .3).
   Conclusion: The research methods tested in this pilot study offer a
   suitable foundation to conduct a full clinical trial. (C) 2015 National

Abstract = {{Systematic spatial analysis of mineral deposit point patterns can reveal
   significant spatial properties of mineral systems, with major
   implications for regional mineral prospectivity modelling. For valid
   results, a study area needs to be clearly defined, taking into account
   permissiveness of the geological units for a particular mineral system
   and effects of cover. Standard statistical tests assuming an isometric
   contiguous study area with regionally homogeneous distribution of
   deposits are likely to produce invalid results. Analysis of regional
   uniformity of spatial deposit density is required for adequate design
   and interpretation of tests for clustering. Spatial distribution of
   orogenic gold deposits in the Hodgkinson Province in Queensland and the
   Western Lachlan Orogen in Victoria (Australia) indicates the presence of
   significant regional linear metallogenic zones, probably controlled by
   deep crustal domain boundaries oblique and not related to any recognised
   major faults. Within the metallogenic zones in both regions, individual
   gold occurrences are strongly clustered into ore fields, but the
   distribution of ore fields is random. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published

Journal = {{VACUUM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{75-81}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we report the measurements we performed of the reduced
   electric field strength E/p in the positive column in the range of the
   gas pressure and tube radius product of 0.01 < pR <30 Torr. cm. We got
   good agreements with numerical models and experimental data of other
   authors. We also present two analytical models for the reduced electric
   field E/p. The first model deals with the ambipolar mode of the positive
   column of the dc discharge in noble gases. We consider the case of low
   discharge current values when one observes a balance between the rate of
   charged particle production due to direct ionization of gas molecules
   through electron impact and their escape to the discharge tube walls.
   Simple expressions for the reduced electric field E/p in the positive
   column in argon are obtained. The second model consists in considering
   the production and loss of charged particles and metastable atoms and
   obtaining a simple equation for the reduced electric field E/p depending

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of far-field Raman micro-spectroscopy was investigated
   to determine quantitatively the actual thickness of organic thin films.
   It is shown that the thickness of organic films can be quantitatively
   determined down to 3 nm with an error margin of 20\% and down to 1.5 nm
   with an error margin of 100\%. Raman imaging of thin-film surfaces with
   a far-field optical microscope establishes the distribution of a polymer
   with a lateral resolution of similar to 400 nm and the homogeneity of
   the film. Raman images are presented for spin-coated thin films of
   polysulfone (PSU) with average thicknesses between 3 and 50 nm. In films
   with an average thickness of 43 nm, the variation in thickness was
   around 5\% for PSU. In films with an average thickness of 3 nm for PSU,
   the detected thickness variation was 100\%. Raman imaging was performed
   in minutes for a surface area of 900 mu m(2). The results illustrate the
   ability of far-field Raman microscopy as a sensitive method to
   quantitatively determine the thickness of thin films down to the

Abstract = {{As Microcystis cell breakage may decrease the water quality, the
   accurate evaluation of cell breakage is of concern in drinking water
   production. Well-known cell breakage indicators such as dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) release and potassium release were investigated in
   comparison with flow cytometry coupled with a fluorescence probe. DOC
   release, potassium release and ratios of SYTOX Green positive cells
   (ruptured cells) were calibrated using known degrees of cell breakage
   (mixtures of live and heated cells). Good linear relationships were
   observed between the indicators and the known ratios of ruptured cells,
   with R-2 values larger than 0.925. Flow cytometry coupled with a
   fluorescence probe had the best overall performance, followed by
   potassium release and then DOC release. Moreover, the influence of
   factors such as extracellular organic matter (EOM), cell intake, sample
   conservation and strong oxidants was also studied. EOM and strong
   oxidants caused the overestimation and underestimation, respectively, of
   the cell breakage by DOC release. Potassium release had a more extensive
   application scope than DOC release and was only influenced by intake by
   residual live cells. Flow cytometry was generally not affected by EOM,
   cell intake or strong oxidants except during long-term storage. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Both beta-catenin (beta-cat) and osterix (OSX) are known to be essential
   for embryonic and postnatal osteoblast differentiation and bone growth.
   In the present study, we explored the crosstalk between beta-cat
   signaling and OSX, and assessed its effect on the osteoblastogenic
   differentiation of human pre-osteoblastic cells (MG-63) and bone marrow
   stromal cells (HS-27A). In the HS-27A and MG-63 cells, the selective
   beta-cat signaling inhibitor, CCT031374, and the stable overexpression
   of a constitutively active beta-cat mutant respectively decreased and
   increased the cytoplasmic/soluble beta-cat levels, and respectively
   decreased and increased TOPflash reporter activity, the mRNA levels of
   beta-cat signaling target genes c-Myc and c-Jun, as well as the mRNA and
   protein expression levels of OSX. Mutational analyses and
   electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the increased
   binding activity of c-Jun at a putative c-Jun binding site (-858/-852
   relative to the translation start codon, which was designated as +1) in
   the human OSX gene promoter was required for teh beta-cat
   signaling-induced expression of OSX in the HS-27A and MG-63 cells.
   During osteoblastogenic culture, stimulating beta-cat signaling activity
   by the stable overexpression of the active beta-cat mutant markedly
   increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition in
   the HS-27A and MG-63 cells, which was abolished by knocking down OSX
   using shRNA. On the other hand, the inhibition of beta-cat signaling
   activity with CCT031374 decreased the ALP activity and calcium
   deposition, which was completely reversed by the overexpression of OSX.
   On the whole, the findings of our study suggest that beta-cat signaling
   upregulates the expression of OSX in human pre-osteoblastic and bone
   marrow stromal cells by trans-activating the OSX gene promoter mainly
   through increased c-Jun binding at a putative c-Jun binding site; OSX
   largely mediates beta-cat signaling-induced osteoblastogenic
   differentiation. The present study provides new insight into the
   molecular mechanisms underlying osteoblast differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Sample preparation is one of the essential processes for most on-chip
   biochemical applications. During this process, raw reactants are diluted
   to specific concentration values. Current sample preparation algorithms
   are generally created for digital microfluidic biochips with the (1:1)
   mixing model. For other biochip architectures supporting multiple mixing
   models, such as flow-based microfluidic biochips, there is still no
   dedicated solution yet. Hence, in this paper, we propose the first
   sample preparation method dedicated to microfluidic biochips with
   various mixing models, named tree pruning and grafting (TPG) algorithm.
   It starts with a dilution tree created by regarding the (1: 1) mixing
   model only, and then applies TPG through a bottom-up dynamic programming
   strategy to obtain a solution with minimal reactant consumption.
   Experimental results show that our algorithm can save reactant amount by
   up to 69\% against the well-known bit-scanning method on a biochip with
   a four-segment mixer. Even compared with the state-of-the-art reactant
   minimization algorithm, it still achieves a reactant reduction of 37\%.
   Therefore, it is convincing that the TPG algorithm is a promising sample
   preparation solution for biochip architectures that support various
   mixing models.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundPrevious studies of drug resistance have shown that mutations
   in the drug resistance-determining region (DRDR) in the Folp1, RpoB and
   GyrA genes of Mycobacterium leprae are responsible for resistance to
   dapsone, rifampin and ofloxacin, respectively.
   AimTo investigate the prevalence of mutations in genes associated with
   drug resistance in M.leprae isolates from patients with leprosy in
   Shandong Province.
   MethodsThe DRDR in the FolP1, RpoB and GyrA genes was analysed by direct
   sequencing of the PCR product from 85 isolates of M.leprae sampled from
   patients with leprosy in Shandong, China.
   ResultsSequencing results were obtained for FolP1, RpoB and GyrA in 67,
   57 and 81 of the 85 samples, with mutation rates of 1.5\% (1/67), 8.8\%
   5/57 and 25.9\% (21/81). Three multidrug-resistant samples were found
   among the new cases: one had a mutation in both Folp1 and RpoB, while
   the other two had a mutation in both RpoB and GyrA.
   ConclusionsPrimary resistance appears to be to either single drugs or
   combinations of two drugs. The resistance rate to dapsone seems to be
   low. To our knowledge, this is the first case of multidrug-resistant
   M.leprae from China.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, an open-type thermoelectric heating system with
   multiple channels was developed. A mathematical model of heat transfer,
   based on one-dimensional treatment of thermal and electric power, is
   conducted. The heating coefficient and production are both correlated in
   terms of temperature difference, thermal conductivity, electric
   resistance and electric current. The looped air circulation was designed
   to simultaneously recycle heat and enhance heater system performance.
   Experimental investigations were conducted to identify thermal
   performance of the thermoelectric heater. Effects of airflow rates
   through the heating side and cooling side, temperatures of heating side
   and cooling side on the performance were investigated. The heating
   coefficient was calculated upon that surface temperatures of hot and
   cold sides were recorded. The results show that the average heating
   coefficient of the thermoelectric heating system could reach to 1.3,
   which is greater than that of a typical electric heater with heating
   coefficient of less than one. The optimal isolation thickness for this
   thermoelectric heater, i.e., 14 mm, is confirmed by the experimental rig
   system. Generally, heating coefficient was found to increase first and
   decrease afterwards when the current was continuously increasing.
   Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the optimum
   performance of the thermoelectric heat recovery heater strongly depends
   on the intensities of these operating parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have shown that angiotensin II AT1 receptor
   gene (AT1R) polymorphisms are associated with the risk for hypertension.
   However, the results remain controversial. In the present study, we
   performed a meta-analysis to systematically summarize the association
   between AT1R genetic polymorphisms and the risk for hypertension.
   Methods: We searched the literature in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of
   Science, Wanfang, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure
   databases (CNKI) to find case-control studies on the associations of
   AT1R genetic polymorphisms with the risk for hypertension. The
   meta-analysis was performed by using RevMan 5.0 software. The
   association of hypertension risk with AT1R genetic polymorphism was
   estimated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals
   (95\% CIs).
   Results: Fifty-six studies involving 28,952 subjects were included in
   the present meta-analysis. Our results suggest that the polymorphism
   (A1166C) of AT1R gene is associated with a statistically increased
   hypertension risk, not only in Asian populations but also in Caucasian
   populations. We did not find any association in African populations.
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that A1166C polymorphism in the
   AT1R gene is associated with the risk of hypertension in Asian and
   Caucasian populations.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The writing prompts in high-stakes tests have become an issue of concern
   due to their possible effect on test takers' writing performance and
   potential washback on writing pedagogy. In the present study, the
   prompts (n = 120) from three of these tests, TOEFL, IELTS and TEM4 (a
   language test in China), were investigated for two elements - their
   specific rhetorical function and object of enquiry - to examine whether
   these prompts displayed certain patterns. Results revealed that both of
   these elements converged around a narrow set of themes and functions.
   Specifically, a preponderance of prompts required responses that were
   either evaluative (44\%) or hortative (23\%) (recommending). As for the
   objects of enquiry, three sociocultural themes were dominant: education
   (34\%); technology (20\%); and current social issues (15\%). These
   findings may indicate that the prompts in high-stakes tests are
   converging around a restricted set of themes, which may be generating
   prescriptive responses that fail to appreciate the full range of
   linguistic and argumentative possibilities normally expected in academic
   writing. Here, we propose that a wider range of writing prompts with
   alternative rhetorical functions and objects of enquiry be considered in
   high-stakes tests in order to facilitate students' writing and thinking
   development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant
   tumors with a poor patient survival. Expression of TGF-beta 1 is
   up-regulated in HCC and is thought to play a crucial role in the
   occurrence and development of HCC. However, the mechanism of TGF-beta
   1-mediated facilitation of malignant growth and invasion remains
   unclear, although some previous studies highlighted a potential
   involvement of the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Here we
   demonstrate that the in vitro migration of the HCC cell line SMMC-7721
   is increased in the presence of recombinant TGF-beta 1, and that this
   effect is reversed by the specific inhibitor SB431542. Furthermore,
   TGF-beta 1 treatment up-regulated the expression of its own mRNA as well
   as the expression of CTGF mRNA. The TGF-beta 1-stimulated migration of
   SMMC-7721 cells was diminished by siRNA silencing of CTGF. These in
   vitro observations were validated in a murine xenograft model. In
   particular, silencing of CTFG diminished the TGF-beta 1-induced
   tumorigenesis in experimental animals. In conclusion, TGF-beta 1 plays a
   critical role in HCC migration and invasion, and this effect is
   dependent on CTGF.}},

Abstract = {{We give estimates of the remainder terms for several

   By considering the variations of associated functionals, we give a
   stability for two dual inequalities: The fractional Sobolev (FS) and
   Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev (HLS) inequalities, in terms of distance to the
   submanifold of extremizers. Then we compare their remainder terms to
   improve the inequalities in another way. We also compare, in the limit
   case, the remainder terms of Beckner-Onofri (BO) inequality and its dual
   logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev (Log-HLS) inequality. Besides, we
   also list without proof some results for other groups of Iwasawa-type.
   Our results generalize earlier works on Euclidean spaces of Chen et al.
   (2013) and Dolbeault and Jankowiak (2014) onto some groups of

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and PurposeThe epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is expressed
   in vascular endothelial cells and is a negative modulator of
   vasodilation. However, the role of endothelial ENaCs in salt-sensitive
   hypertension remains unclear. Here, we have investigated how endothelial
   ENaCs in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats respond to high-salt (HS) challenge.
   Experimental ApproachBP and plasma aldosterone levels were measured. We
   used patch-clamp technique to record ENaC activity in split-open
   mesenteric arteries (MAs). Western blot and Griess assay were used to
   detect expression of -ENaCs, eNOS and NO. Vasorelaxation in second-order
   MAs was measured with wire myograph assays.
   Key ResultsFunctional ENaCs were observed in endothelial cells and their
   activity was significantly decreased after 1 week of HS diet. After 3
   weeks of HS diet, ENaC expression was also reduced. When either ENaC
   activity or expression was reduced, endothelium-dependent relaxation
   (EDR) of MAs, in response to ACh, was enhanced. This enhancement of EDR
   was mimicked by amiloride, a blocker of ENaCs. By contrast, HS diet
   significantly increased contractility of MAs, accompanied by decreased
   eNOS activity and NO levels. However, ACh-induced release of NO was much
   higher in MAs isolated from HS rats than those from NS rats.
   Conclusions and ImplicationsHS intake increased the BP of SD rats, but
   simultaneously enhanced EDR by reducing ENaC activity and expression due
   to feedback inhibition. Therefore, ENaCs may play an important role in
   endothelial cells allowing the vasculature to adapt to HS conditions.

Abstract = {{A one-pot method for the fast synthesis of a 3D nanochain network (NNC)
   of PdCu alloy without any surfactants is described. The composition of
   the as-prepared PdCu alloy catalysts can be precisely controlled by
   changing the precursor ratio of Pd to Cu. First, the Cu content changes
   the electronic structure of Pd in the 3D NNC of PdCu alloy. Second, the
   3D network structure offers large open pores, high surface areas, and
   self-supported properties. Third, the surfactant-free strategy results
   in a relatively clean surface. These factors all contribute to better
   electrocatalytic activity and durability towards ethanol oxidation.
   Moreover, the use of copper in the alloy lowers the price of the
   catalyst by replacing the noble metal palladium with non-noble metal
   copper. The composition-optimized Pd80Cu20 alloy in the 3D NNC catalyst
   shows an increased electrochemically active surface area (80.95
   m(2)g(-1)) and a 3.62-fold enhancement of mass activity (6.16 Amg(-1))

Title = {{The association of DNA methylation and brain volume in healthy
   individuals and schizophrenia patients}},

Abstract = {{Both methylation and brain volume patterns hold important biological
   information for the development and prognosis of schizophrenia (SZ). A
   combined study to probe the association between them provides a new
   perspective to understanding SZ. Genomic methylation of peripheral blood
   and regional brain volumes derived from magnetic resonance imaging were
   analyzed using parallel independent component analyses in this study.
   Nine methylation components and five brain volumetric components were
   extracted for 94 SZ patients and 106 healthy controls. After controlling
   for age, sex, race, and substance use, a component comprised primarily
   of bilateral cerebellar volumes was significantly correlated to a
   methylation component from 14 CpG sites in 13 genes. Both patients and
   healthy controls demonstrated similar associations, but patients had
   significantly smaller cerebellar volumes and dysmethylation in the
   associated epigenetic component compared to controls. The 13 genes are
   enriched in cellular growth and proliferation with some genes involved
   in neuronal growth and cerebellum development (GATA4, ADRA1D, EPHA3, and
   KCNK10), and these genes are prominently associated with neurological
   and psychological disorders. Such findings suggest that the methylation
   pattern of the genes coding for cellular growth may influence the
   cerebellar development through regulating gene expression, and the
   alteration in the methylation of these genes in SZ patients may
   contribute to the cerebellar volume reduction observed in patients. (C)

Abstract = {{Obesity is the cause of up to one third of all cancers affecting women
   today, most notably endometrial, colon, and breast cancers. Women's
   health providers are poised to advise women on obesity's link to cancer
   development, but often lack resources or training to provide appropriate
   counseling. Here, we review obesity's role in increasing the risk of
   several common reproductive system conditions faced by women, including
   polycystic ovarian syndrome, infertility, gynecologic surgical
   complications, and pregnancy complications. These events can be used as
   teachable moments to help frame the discussion of weight management and
   promote cancer prevention. We also review national guidelines and
   existing tangible weight-loss strategies that can be employed within the
   outpatient women's health setting to help women achieve weight-loss
   goals and affect cancer prevention.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the H-infinity state estimation problem for a
   class of discrete-time nonlinear systems of the neural network type with
   random time-varying delays and multiple missing measurements. These
   nonlinear systems include recurrent neural networks, complex network
   systems, Lur'e systems, and so on which can be described by a unified
   model consisting of a linear dynamic system and a static nonlinear
   operator. The missing phenomenon commonly existing in measurements is
   assumed to occur randomly by introducing mutually individual random
   variables satisfying certain kind of probability distribution.
   Throughout this paper, first a Luenberger-like estimator based on the
   imperfect output data is constructed to obtain the immeasurable system
   states. Then, by virtue of Lyapunov stability theory and stochastic
   method, the H-infinity performance of the estimation error dynamical
   system (augmented system) is analyzed. Based on the analysis, the
   H-infinity estimator gains are deduced such that the augmented system is
   globally mean square stable. In this paper, both the variation range and
   distribution probability of the time delay are incorporated into the
   control laws, which allows us to not only have more accurate models of
   the real physical systems, but also obtain less conservative results.
   Finally, three illustrative examples are provided to validate the
   proposed control laws.}},

Volume = {{110}},

Abstract = {{Based on molecular dynamics using the embedded-atom-method potentials
   and the discrete-variational method for the Ni-Al-Re and Ni-Al-W
   systems, the effect of Re and W upon the brittle fracture in Ni3Al
   cracks at three crack orientations is investigated. The results show
   that Re and W may strengthen the Ni3Al alloy and improve the deformation
   resistance of the materials. The lattice trapping limits are not changed
   with the addition of a single Re or W atom, but they increase with the
   addition of 1 and 2 at. \% Re or W atoms, and more so with the addition
   of W atoms. The study reveals that Re and W can prevent bond breaking at
   the crack tip and can promote crack healing in Ni3Al, with W exhibiting
   a stronger effect than Re. Furthermore, the increasing fracture stress
   values with the increasing concentrations of doping atoms implies that
   Re and W can improve the brittle fracture strength in Ni3Al cracks,
   where W has a stronger effect. These results can be related to the
   stronger bonding strengths of Ni-Re and Ni-W than that of Ni-Al. (C)

   Data Envelopment Analysis Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{In pursuit of more sustainable development of industry, China has been
   actively developing eco-industrial parks (EIPs) for more than a decade.
   However, the environmental value of these EIPs remains largely
   unverified. This study aimed to evaluate the environmental performance
   of national EIPs in China using data envelopment analysis.
   Eco-efficiency and environmental performance indices were used to
   represent the static and dynamic environmental performance of EIPs,
   respectively. An environmental performance index was formed by combining
   measures of eco-efficiency in a dynamic setting with the sequential
   Malmquist index approach. We obtained three main empirical findings.
   First, 34 national EIPs exhibited a cumulative environmental performance
   improvement of 89.4\% from 2007 to 2010, which is primarily the result
   of eco-efficiency change rather than environmental technical change.
   Second, compared with the trial EIPs, the demonstration EIPs had a
   higher average eco-efficiency (0.611 vs. 0.446 in 2010) and experienced
   greater average environmental performance improvement (129\% vs. 60\%).
   Third, the EIPs retrofitted from high-tech industrial development zones
   exhibited much higher average eco-efficiency (0.798 vs. 0.440 in 2010)
   than those retrofitted from economic and technical development zones.
   The key measures supporting the performance improvement and policy
   implications for the development of EIPs are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The laboratory investigation about short chain alcohol effect on
   flotation performance of quartz using N-dodecyl ethylenediamine (ND) as

   alcohol could improve flotation performance of ND effectively, resulting
   in a higher flotation recovery of quartz. Maximum flotation recovery of
   quartz was obtained when the mass ratio of ND and alcohol was 1:1. More
   importantly, chain structure of alcohol played an important role in
   quartz flotation. Longer hydrocarbon chain and more substituents of
   alcohol usually related to higher flotation recovery. Zeta-potential
   measurement and FTIR spectroscopy study demonstrated the co-adsorption
   of diamine and alcohol on quartz surface, of which hydrogen bonding and
   electrostatic adsorptions between collector and quartz surface were
   strengthened by the addition of alcohol. Furthermore, higher
   cross-sectional area of alcohol usually related to stronger hydrogen
   bonding and electrostatic affinity. Therefore, higher flotation recovery
   of quartz was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a dynamic plasmapause location model established
   based on 5 years of Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions
   during Substorms (THEMIS) measurements from 2009 to 2013. In total, 5878
   plasmapause crossing events are identified, sufficiently covering all 24
   magnetic local time (MLT) sectors. Based on this plasmapause crossing
   database, we investigate the correlations between plasmapause locations
   with solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indices. Input parameters for
   the best fits are obtained for different MLT sectors, and finally, we
   choose five input parameters to build a plasmapause location model,
   including 5 min-averaged SYM-H, AL, and AU indices as well as
   hourly-averaged AE and Kp indices. two out-of-sample comparisons on the
   evolution of the plasmapause is shown during two magnetic storms,
   demonstrating good agreement between model results and observations. Two
   major advantages are achieved by this model. First, this model provides
   plasmapause locations at 24 MLT sectors, still providing good
   consistency with observations. Second, this model is able to reproduce
   dynamic variations of the plasmapause on timescales as short as 5 min.}},

Title = {{Dual Effects of Managerial Pro-Social Rule Breaking on Employee Behavior
   in the Chinese Context}},
Journal = {{REVISTA DE CERCETARE SI INTERVENTIE SOCIALA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{187-201}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Currently, the phenomenon that social rule is overshadowed by power and
   favor exchange still exists in Chinese culture and society.
   Consequently, the problem of managerial pro-social rule breaking (MPSRB)
   occurs frequently in enterprise management. However, the consequences of
   MPSRB are relatively ambiguous and controversial. Using interview data
   obtained from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Xi'an in China, the
   categories of MPSRB and their influence on employee behavior were
   explored in this study by integrating universalism and particularism
   from the perspectives of trust in leadership and institutional trust.
   Results show that in the Chinese context, MPSRB can be classified as
   bene-volence- based, practicability-based and justice-based, and its
   influence on employees' organizational trust (i.e., trust in leadership
   and institutional trust) is dualistic and opposite, that is, MPSRB
   improves employees' trust in leadership while decreasing institutional
   trust. Through the mediating effect of trust in leadership, MPSRB
   improves relation-oriented employee behavior. By contrast, MPSRB reduces
   task-oriented employee behavior through the mediating effect of
   institutional trust. These findings can actively contribute toward the
   enhancement of Chinese organizational behavior and social behavior
   intervention theories. Furthermore, the results are beneficial for
   enterprises with respect to the positive interventions and guidance of
   managers and employees' behaviors by developing scientific and rational
   management measures necessary for further improvement in organizational
   effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{In the rock breaking progress, the resistant force results in tools
   failure and the low cutting efficiency, thus, it is necessary to reduce
   the failure of tools and enhance the efficiency of cutting and drilling.
   In this paper, different configuration modes of water jet were presented
   to solve this issue. Moreover, the symmetrical pre-split finite element
   models for rock breaking by pick without water jet and picks assisted
   with different configuration modes of water jet were established to
   analyze the effect of different configuration modes on rock stress
   distribution and pick cutting forces. Finally, the experiments were
   conducted to validate the theory analysis. The results indicate that the
   cutting force decreasing rate of JCP is maximum all the time under the
   same conditions compared with the decreasing rate of JSP and JFP; and
   the numerical results were consistent with the numerical, which verifies
   the correctness of theory analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A novel polarization rotator of arbitrary angle was proposed and
   realized based on simple slot arrays. To achieve the rotation of an
   arbitrary angle a, the slots on the first layer have to be at an angle
   of a to the slots on the second layer. Consequently, 90 degrees rotation
   can be realized using two perpendicularly oriented slot arrays, which
   overturns the conventional notion of that perpendicular slot arrays are
   not possible to pass electromagnetic wave. In addition, such structure
   provides the same bandwidth comparing to its counterpart utilized for
   frequency selective surface (FSS). Furthermore, such structure is much
   easier to be fabricated compared to the substrate integrated waveguide
   (SIW) array. Moreover, low insertion loss can be achieved based on
   metallic material. (C) 2015 Author(s). All article content, except where

Abstract = {{A method combining ultrasonic impact treatment with electrospark was
   developed to fabricate ceramic coatings on Ti-6Al-4V alloy. In this
   paper, the mechanism of the combined process is described in detail. The
   microstructure, chemical states, phase composition and surface residual
   stress of the ceramic coated titanium alloy were presented. The coatings
   mainly consist of carbides of titanium. The hardness of the coating
   increased significantly owing to the existence of the ceramic phase.
   Further, the impact process and the narrow space that the shock ball
   traverses decrease the surface roughness of the sample after the
   combined process. Finally, the surface residual stress of the sample
   treated by the combined process is compressive stress.}},

Abstract = {{Pervasive wireless communication and computing can facilitate a variety
   of ehealth applications to communicate patient medical data and
   information to the doctors/ caregivers in an e-Health environment. With
   the advancement of medical devices and practicing methods the concept of
   in-cooperating latest communication techniques have taken a new
   direction by enabling cognitive radio networks in e-Health applications.
   This paper presents an approach to solve the joint call admission
   control and power allocation problem in a hospital environment based on
   green cognitive radio. Specifically, a multiobjective non-convex mixed
   integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem of wireless access in an
   indoor hospital environment is formulated to maximize the number of
   admitted secondary users and minimize transmit power and carbon dioxide
   emission. Along with that the throughput requirement of all secondary
   users and interference constraints for the protected and primary users
   are also satisfied. In this paper, we invoke outer approximation
   approach based linearization technique to solve MINLP problem. The
   proposed method gives guaranteed e convergence to the optimal solution
   results with reasonable computational complexity. Simulation results
   verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach method.}},

Abstract = {{Xylanase XynG1-1 from Paenibacillus campinasensis G1-1 consists of a
   catalytic domain (CD), a family 6\_36 carbohydrate-binding module which
   is a xylan-binding domain (XBD), and a linker sequence (LS) between
   them. The structure of XynG1-3 from Bacillus pumilus G1-3 consists only
   of a CD. To investigate the functions and properties of the XBD and LS
   of XynG1-1, two truncated forms (XynG1-1CDL, XynG1-1CD) and three fusion
   derivatives (XynG1-3CDL, XynG1-3CDX and XynG1-3CDLX) were constructed
   and biochemically characterized. The optimum conditions for the
   catalytic activity of mutants of XynG1-1 and XynG1-3 were 60 A degrees C
   and pH 7.0, and 55 A degrees C and pH 8.0, respectively, the same as for
   the corresponding wild-type enzymes. XynGs with an XBD were stable over
   a broad temperature (30-80 A degrees C) and pH range (4.0-11.0),
   respectively, on incubation for 3 h. Kinetic parameters (K (m) , k
   (cat), k (cat)/K (m) ) of XynGs were determined with soluble birchwood
   xylan and insoluble oat spelt xylan as substrates. XynGs with the XBD
   showed better affinities toward, and more efficient catalysis of
   hydrolysis of the insoluble substrate. The XBD had positive effects on
   thermostability and pH stability and a crucial function in the ability
   of the enzyme to bind and hydrolyze insoluble substrate. The LS had
   little effect on the overall stability of the xylanase and no
   relationship with affinities for soluble and insoluble substrates or
   catalytic efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide racial prejudice is originated from in-group/out-group
   discrimination. This prejudice can bias face perception at the very
   beginning of social interaction. However, little is known about the
   neurocognitive mechanism underlying the influence of racial prejudice on
   facial emotion perception. Here, we examined the neural basis of disgust
   perception in racial prejudice using a passive viewing task and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that compared with the
   disgusted faces of in-groups, the disgusted faces of out-groups result
   in increased amygdala and insular engagement, positive coupling of the
   insula with amygdala-based emotional system, and negative coupling of
   the insula with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)-based regulatory system.
   Furthermore, machine-learning algorithms revealed that the level of
   implicit racial prejudice could be predicted by functional couplings of
   the insula with both the amygdala and the ACC, which suggests that the
   insula is largely involved in racially biased disgust perception through
   two distinct neural circuits. In addition, individual difference in
   disgust sensitivity was found to be predictive of implicit racial
   prejudice. Taken together, our results suggest a crucial role of
   insula-centered circuits for disgust perception in racial prejudice. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: Epidemiological studies have reported an inconsistent
   association between obesity and ovarian cancer. To update the current
   knowledge of and further qualify the association between overweight,
   obesity and ovarian cancer risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of
   published observational studies.
   Methods: Using the PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, we performed a
   literature search of all of the case-control and cohort studies
   published as original articles in English before March 2015. We included
   26 observational studies, of which 13 were case-control studies (7782
   cases and 21 854 controls) and 13 were cohort studies (5181 cases).
   Fixed-and random-effects models were used to compute summary estimates
   and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses were
   also performed.
   Results: The pooled relative risk for overweight and obesity compared
   with normal weight (body mass index = 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)) was 1.07 (95\%
   confidence interval: 1.02-1.12) and 1.28 (95\% confidence interval:
   1.16-1.41), respectively. In subgroup analyses, we found that
   overweight/obesity increased the risk of ovarian cancer in most groups,
   except for the postmenopausal group (overweight: pooled relative risk =
   0.97, 95\% confidence interval: 0.76-1.24; obesity: pooled relative risk
   = 0.93, 95\% confidence interval: 0.61-1.42). There was no evidence of
   publication bias.
   Conclusions: Increased body weight was associated with an increased risk
   of ovarian cancer; in particular, severe obesity demonstrated a stronger
   risk effect. No statistically significant association was observed in
   the postmenopausal period, but was in the premenopausal period.}},

Abstract = {{Leveler is widely used to improve the quality of defective mild steel
   plates. Its typical ranges of the leveling capacity are constrained by
   three criteria, namely the maximum stroke of rollers, allowable total
   leveling force and motor power. In this work, an optimization model with
   equality and inequality constraints was built for the maximum yield
   stress search of each thickness of plates. The corresponding search
   procedure with three loops was given. The approximate range by the
   simplification model could be used as the initial value for the actual
   range search of the leveling capacity. Therefore, the search speed could
   be accelerated compared with a global search. The consistency of the
   analytical results and field data demonstrates the reliability of the
   proposed model and procedure. The typical ranges of the leveling
   capacity are expressed by several boundary curves which are helpful to
   judge whether the incoming plate can be leveled quickly or not. Also,
   these curves can be used to find the maximum yield stress for a specific
   thickness or the maximum thickness for a yield stress for plates.}},

   Screening}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{493-510}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The prevailing lack of consensus about the comparative harms and
   benefits of cancer screening stems, in part, from the inappropriate
   calculations of the expected mortality impact of a sustained screening
   programme. There is an inherent, and often substantial, time lag from
   the time of screening until the resulting mortality reductions begin,
   reach their maximum and ultimately end. However, the cumulative
   mortality reduction reported in a randomised screening trial is
   typically calculated over an arbitrarily defined follow-up period,
   including follow-up time where the mortality impact is yet to realise or
   where it has already been exhausted. Because of this, the cumulative
   reduction cannot be used for projecting the mortality impact expected
   from a sustained screening programme. For this purpose, we propose a new
   measure, the time-specific probability of being helped by screening,
   given that the cancer would have proven fatal otherwise. This can be
   decomposed into round-specific impacts, which in turn can be
   parametrised and estimated from the trial data. This represents a major
   shift in quantifying the benefits due to a sustained screening
   programme, based on statistical evidence extracted from existing trial
   data. We illustrate our approach using data from screening trials in
   lung and colorectal cancers.}},

Abstract = {{The processing of time delays is one of the key challenges in the use of
   wide-area power system stabilizer (WPSS) in engineering. In this study,
   the various time delays and their sources in WPSS applications are
   analyzed and measured. Strategies to reduce these time delays and the
   data transmission delay jitter of phasor measurement unit (PMU) used in
   WPSS closed-loop control are also investigated. A predictive control
   scheme that addresses the problems caused by time-varying delays in
   practical WPSS closed-loop applications is proposed. The effectiveness
   of the proposed scheme is verified through simulation experiments of
   Guizhou Power Grid (GZPG) in Southwestern China using a real time
   digital simulator. Moreover, this novel scheme has the potential to be
   improved and used widely in many applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   Students don't have a pure learning style, but a combination of two or
   more of them, which favours the learning process as they have more tools
   to adapt to the teachers', the courses' and the study program's

Abstract = {{Consider a network of prosumers of media content in which users
   dynamically create and request content objects. The request process is
   governed by the objects' popularity, which may vary across network
   regions and over time. In order to meet user requests, content objects
   can be stored and transported over the network, characterized by the
   capacity and efficiency of its storage and transport resources. The
   energy-efficient dynamic content distribution problem aims at finding
   the evolution of the network configuration, in terms of the placement
   and routing of content objects over time, that meets user requests,
   satisfies network resource capacities and minimizes overall energy use.
   We present 1) an information-centric linear programming formulation for
   the energy efficient dynamic content distribution problem that captures
   multicasting and caching over the network, per-object system dynamics,
   and delivery deadlines; 2) an offline solution that characterizes the
   minimum energy use achievable with global knowledge of user requests and
   network resources; and 3) an efficient distributed online solution that
   allows network nodes to make caching decisions based on their local
   estimate of the global energy benefit. Using a custom-built content
   distribution network simulator as well as a real prototype
   implementation in an information-centric networking testbed, we show the
   significant energy savings that can be obtained via the efficient and
   lightweight cache cooperation induced by our service and energy aware
   distributed online solution with respect to state of the art approaches.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most promising ways of meeting climate policy targets is
   improving energy efficiency, i.e., reducing the amount of scarce and
   polluting resources needed to produce a given quantity of output.
   Relying upon the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), we investigate the
   decline in energy intensity in the EU27 countries between 1995 and 2009.
   Changes in energy intensity can be attributed to two different drivers:
   changes in the industrial composition of an economy and changes in its
   sectoral energy intensities. We conduct a series of index decomposition
   analyses (IDA) to isolate the effects exerted by these drivers. We then
   take the findings from the index decomposition analysis and subject them
   to panel estimations. The objective is to control for factors that may
   have shaped the evolution of energy intensity in the European Union. We
   estimate the changes in energy intensity as well as the changes in
   (energy-relevant) structural change and in the sectoral energy
   intensities. Therefore, we are able to reveal the channels through which
   factors such as economic growth, capital intensity, and energy prices
   affect energy intensity.

Journal = {{HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments examined the dynamic interaction between cognitive
   resources in short-term memory and bimanual object manipulation by
   extending recent research by Logan and Fischman (2011). In Experiment 1,
   16 participants completed a bimanual end-state comfort task and a memory
   task requiring serial recall of 12 words or pictures. The end-state
   comfort task involved moving two glasses between two shelves.
   Participants viewed the items, performed the end-state comfort task, and
   then serially recalled the items. Recall was evaluated by the presence
   or absence of primacy and recency effects. The end-state comfort effect
   (ESCE) was assessed by the percentage of initial hand positions that
   allowed the hands to end comfortably. The main findings indicated that
   the ESCE was disrupted; the primacy effect remained intact; and the
   recency effect disappeared regardless of the type of memory item
   recalled. In Experiment 2, 16 participants viewed six items, performed
   an end-state comfort task, viewed another six items, and then serially
   recalled all 12 items. Results were essentially the same as in
   Experiment 1. Findings suggest that executing a bimanual end-state
   comfort task, regardless of when it is completed during a memory task,
   diminishes the recency effect irrespective of the type of memory item.

   six-month course. Findings, based on a nonparametric test, show
   significant differences between the pre and post-test. After the course,
   participants displayed a higher level of self-efficacy in making
   decisions, a higher level of probability of becoming entrepreneurs and a
   lower level of pessimism in projecting their future. Despite deserving
   to be corroborated with a more sophisticated research design, this study
   contributes to the extant literature by providing further empirical

Abstract = {{In present study, a lumped conceptual hydrological model, NAM (MIKE11),
   is calibrated while optimizing the runoff simulations on the basis of
   minimization of percentage water balance (\% WBL) and root mean square
   error (RMSE) using measured stream flow data of eight years from 1991 to
   1998 for Yerli catchment (area = 15,701 km(2)) of upper Tapi basin,
   Maharashtra in Western India. The sensitivity of runoff volume and
   peak-runoff has been undertaken with reference to nine NAM parameters
   using the data of calibration period. The runoff volume and peak-runoff
   have been found to be highly sensitive with reference to maximum water
   content in root zone storage (L-max) and overland flow coefficient
   (CQOF) respectively. On the other hand, runoff volume is found to be
   moderately sensitive with maximum water content in surface storage
   (U-max). The calibrated model has been validated for independent stream
   flow data of Yerli gauging site for years 2001-2004, and Gopalkheda
   gauging site for years 1991-1998 and 2001-2004. The model performance
   has been assessed using statistical performance indices, and compared
   the same with their yardsticks suggested in published literature. The
   simulated results demonstrated that calibrated model is able to simulate
   hydrographs satisfactorily for Yerli (NSE = 0.86-0.88, r = 0.93-0.96, EI
   = 1.05-1.12) as well as Gopalkheda sub catchments (NSE = 0.76-0.92 and r
   = 0.88-0.96, EI = 0.89-0.91) at monthly time scale. The model also
   performs reasonably well in simulating the annual hydrographs at daily
   time scale. The calibrated model may be useful in prediction of water

Abstract = {{It has been previously shown that the long-term inhibition of
   milking-induced prolactin (PRL) release by quinagolide (QN), a dopamine
   agonist, reduces milk yield in dairy cows. To further demonstrate that
   PRL is galactopoietic in cows, we performed a short-term experiment that
   used PRL injections to restore the release of PRL at milking in
   QN-treated cows. Nine Holstein cows were assigned to treatments during
   three 5-d periods in a 3 x 3 Latin square design: 1) QN: twice-daily
   i.m. injections of 1 mg of QN; 2) QN-PRL: twice-daily i.m. injections.of
   1 mg of QN and twice-daily (at milking time) i.v. injections of PRL (2
   mu g/kg body weight); and 3) control: twice-daily injections of the
   vehicles. Mammary epithelial cells (MEG) were purified from milk so that
   their viability could be assessed, and mammary biopsies were harvested
   for immunohistological analyses of cell proliferation using PCNA and
   STAT5 staining. In both milk-purified MEG and mammary tissue, the mRNA
   levels of milk proteins and BAX were determined using real-time
   reverse-transcription PCR. Daily QN injections reduced milking-induced
   PRL release. The area under the PRL curve was similar in the control and
   PRL injection treatments, but the shape was different. The QN treatment
   decreased milk, lactose, protein, and casein production. Injections of
   PRL did not restore milk yield but tended to increase milk protein
   yield. In mammary tissue, the percentage of STAT5-positive cells was
   reduced during QN but not during QN-PRL in comparison with the control
   treatment. The percentage of PCNA-positive cells was greater during
   QN-PRL injections than during the control or QN treatment and tended to
   be lower during QN than during the control treatment. In milk-purified
   MEG, kappa-casein and et-lactalbumin mRNA levels were lower during QN
   than during the control treatment, but during QN-PRL, they were not
   different from the control treatment. In mammary tissue, the BAX mRNA
   level was lower during QN-PRL than during QN. The number of MEG
   exfoliated into milk was increased by QN injections but tended to be
   decreased by PRL injections. Injections of PRL also increased the
   viability of MEG harvested from milk. Although PRL injections at milking
   could not reverse the effect of QN treatment on milk production, their
   effects on cell survival and exfoliation and on gene expression suggest
   that the effect of QN treatment on the mammary gland is due to QN's
   inhibition of PRL secretion.}},

Abstract = {{Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) genetically link an antigen-binding
   domain with cell-signaling domains to redirect immune cell specificity

   principles impacting CAR potency, and today CARs can be readily
   generated toward essentially any cell surface target on cancer cells.
   Efficacy thus far has been most impressive using CD19-CAR expressing T
   cells to treat B cell lymphoblastic leukemia, although clear activity
   has also been observed using CD19-CARs in patients with chronic
   lymphocytic leukemic and B cell lymphoma. Much less data is available
   regarding CAR efficacy for solid tumors. Here, we summarize current
   concepts of CAR design, with a focus on the relationship between
   structure and function, a review of the clinical results reported thus

Abstract = {{Background Knowledge of the BRAFV600E status is mandatory in metastatic
   melanoma patients (MMP). Molecular biology is currently the gold
   standard method for status assessment.
   Objectives We assessed and compared the specificity, sensibility,
   cost-effectiveness and turnaround time (TAT) of immunohistochemistry
   (IHC) and molecular biology for detection of the BRAFV600E mutation in
   188 MMP.
   Methods IHC, with the VE1 antibody, and pyrosequencing analysis were
   performed with formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumour samples.
   Results The BRAFV600E mutation was detected by pyrosequencing in 91/188
   (48\%) patients. IHC was strongly positive (3+) in all of these 91
   cases. IHC was strongly positive in 9/188 (5\%) cases in which the
   molecular testing failed due to non-amplifiable DNA. Weak or moderate
   staining was noted in 10/188 (5\%) cases in which the molecular biology
   identified BRAF wild-type tumours. The ratio of the global cost for
   IHC/molecular biology testing was 1 : 2.2. The average TAT was 48 h vs.
   96 h, for IHC vs. molecular biology testing, respectively.
   Conclusions This study showed that VE1 IHC should be a substitute for
   molecular biology in the initial assessment of the BRAFV600E status in
   MPP. This methodology needs to be set up in pathology laboratories in
   accordance with quality control/quality assurance accreditation
   procedures. Under these strict conditions the question is to know if
   BRAFV600E-IHC can serve not only as a prescreening tool, but also as a
   stand-alone test (at least in cases displaying an unequivocally staining
   pattern) as well as an alternative predictive test for samples for which
   the molecular biology failed.}},

Abstract = {{A series of (NaMgPO4)(0.98-x/3):Eu-0.02(3+), Na-x(+) phosphors were
   prepared by the solid-state method. XRD results confirm that the
   phosphors contain mixture phases of crystals. The doped effect of Na+
   ions on fluorescent properties of the phosphors is discussed. The
   results indicate that the doping effect of Na+ ions on PL intensity (615
   nm) and R (the intensity ratio of D-5(0)-->F-7(2) to D-5(0)-->F-7(1)) is
   just the opposite. The former is a positive effect, while the latter is
   a negative effect. Meanwhile, R of all samples is larger than 1. But,
   the difference among the R of all samples is too small to affect the
   chromaticity coordinates of the samples. These measurements showed that
   the sample of (NaMgPO4)(0.97):Eu-0.02(3+), Na-0.03(+) with the optimized
   molar concentration of Na+ ions (3\%), could be a potential red-emitting

Abstract = {{In June 2015, invitations were sent by email to 151 APAME journals to
   participate in an online survey with an objective of gaining insight
   into the common publication misconduct encountered by APAME editors. The
   survey, conducted through SurveyMonkey over a 20-day-period, comprised
   10 questions with expansions to allow anecdotes limited to 400
   characters, estimated to take less than 10 minutes to complete. Only one
   invitation was issued per journal, targeting (in order of priority)
   editors, editorial board members and editorial staff, and limited by
   email availability. 54 (36\%) journals responded. 98\% of respondents
   held Editor or Editorial Board positions. All respondent journals have
   editorial policies on publication ethics and 96\% provide instructions
   related to ethics. 45\% use anti-plagiarism software to screen
   manuscripts, the most popular being iThenticate, CrossCheck and
   Turnitin. Up to 50\% of journals had encountered studies without IRB
   approval. Author misconduct encountered were (in rank order): plagiarism
   (75\%), duplicate publication (58\%), unjustified authorship (39\%),
   authorship disputes (33\%), data falsification (29\%), data/image
   manipulation (27\%), conflict of interest (25\%), copyright violation
   (17\%) and breach of confidentiality (10\%). Reviewer misconduct
   encountered were: conflict of interest (19\%), plagiarism (17\%),
   obstructive behavior (17\%), abusive language (13\%) and breach of
   confidentiality (13\%). Notwithstanding the limitations of the survey
   and the response rate, a few insights have been gained: (1) the need for
   strengthening the ethical culture of researchers/authors and reviewers,
   (2) anti-plagiarism software can improve plagiarism detection by about
   15\%, and (3) the need for technical support to detect plagiarism,
   duplicate publication and image manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the analysis of different studies that highlight the important
   role of affect and intra-family dialogue against the misbehavior of
   children in society, we plan to know the opinion of the educational
   community about this and which ones measures they propose to eradicate
   bullying. To obtain this information, we carried out a study in the
   community of La Rioja, using a questionnaire in a sample of 348
   middle-school students. Also, thirty teachers were interviewed; two
   focus groups with parents and two with students from different places
   and types of school. Rioja educational community confirms that a family
   atmosphere devoid of affection and dialogue influences significantly and
   positively in the violent behavior of students in the school, proposing
   as the primary measure parent training in communication skills, less
   clear opinions in boys and younger students. Other proposed measures
   are: that parents to spend more time with their children, provide them
   more affection and values-based education, in addition to monitor the
   consumption of violence in the media, denouncing more and by making
   close their relationship with the educational and social community to
   get help.}},

Abstract = {{The thermochemical processing of biomass is an alternative route for the
   manufacture of fuel-grade ethanol, in which the catalytic conversion of
   syngas to ethanol is a key step. The search for novel catalyst
   formulations, active sites and types of support is of current interest.
   In this work, the catalytic performance of an Rh/MCM-41 catalyst has
   been evaluated and compared with a typical Rh/SiO2 catalyst. They have
   been compared at identical reaction conditions (280 degrees C and 20
   bar), at low syngas conversion (2.8\%) and at same metal dispersion
   (H/Rh = 22\%). Under these conditions, the catalysts showed different
   product selectivities. The differences have been attributed to the
   concentration of water vapor in the pores of Rh/MCM-41. The
   concentration of water vapor could promote the water-gas-shift-reaction
   generating some extra carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which in turn can
   induce side reactions and change the product selectivity. The extra
   hydrogen generated could facilitate the hydrogenation of a
   C-2-oxygenated intermediate to ethanol, thus resulting in a higher
   ethanol selectivity over the Rh/MCM-41 catalyst as compared to the
   typical Rh/SiO2 catalyst; 24\% and 8\%, respectively. The catalysts have
   been characterized, before and after reaction, by N-2-physisorption,
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, H-2-chemisorption,
   transmission electron microscopy and temperature programmed reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Intimate partner violence (IPV) is one of the most common forms of
   violence against women worldwide. Among Mexican women, it is estimated
   that 15 to 71 \% have experienced physical or sexual abuse by an

   prevalence of four leading risk factors associated with IPV (alcohol
   consumption, education, socioeconomic status (SES), and gender roles) in
   adult women (n = 68) in a migrant farmworker community in M,xico.
   Alcohol consumption among women was higher than the national average,
   and partner consumption was lower. Education level and SES were low, and
   women identified with a feminist ideology more than a traditional gender
   role. Results also revealed that 86.4 \% (n = 57) of participants
   identified violence against women as a common problem in the community,
   and the majority (94.0 \%, n = 62) of participants believe that IPV
   specifically is a problem within the community.}},

   Spain, 2012-2014}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Cancer worry varies among patients and may influence their
   participation in preventive activities. We tested whether
   sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, locus of control,
   comorbidity, and perceived health status were associated with the level
   of cancer worry among adults aged 50 or older.
   Methods We conducted an observational cross-sectional study of 666
   adults in Spain aged 50 or older. Participants were selected by simple
   random sampling and asked to visit their designated health center for a
   personal interview. The study variables were level of cancer worry
   (measured by Cancer Worry Scale {[}CWS]), sociodemographic
   characteristics, lifestyle, personal history or family history of
   cancer, comorbidity, self-perceived health, locus of control, and social
   support.
   Results More than half of participants, 58.1\%, were women; mean age was
   60.5 years (standard deviation {[}SD], 6.8 y). Measurement of the
   frequency and severity of cancer worry (possible scale of 6-24 points)
   yielded a mean CWS score of 9.3 (95\% confidence interval, 9.0-9.5);
   31.9\% of participants reported being concerned about cancer. Scores
   were higher among women (9.7 {[}SD, 3.3]) than men (8.7 {[}SD, 2.7]) (P
   < .001) and among participants in rural settings (10.0 {[}SD, 3.4]) than
   in urban settings (9.0 {[}SD, 3.0]) (P < .001). Multiple linear
   regression showed a greater degree of cancer worry among people with
   personal or family history of cancer, more health problems, worse
   self-perceived health, and lower social support.
   Conclusion Cancer worry is frequent among older adults, and the level of
   such concern is related not only to personal characteristics but also to
   lifestyle and health status. Further research is required to understand
   how contextual factors can influence cancer worry and how such concern
   changes behavior patterns related to cancer prevention activities.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Examine the association between movement patterns and
   predicted risk of a first atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
   event.
   Methods. Data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey (NHANES) were used (40-79 yrs; N = 2421).
   Participants wore an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer to create four
   movement pattern groups; Group 1: = 150 min/wk of moderate-to-vigorous
   physical activity (MVPA) and light-intensity physical activity (LIPA) =
   sedentary behavior (SB); Group 2: >= 150 min/wk of MVPA and LIPA < SB;
   Group 3: <150 min/wk of MVPA and LIPA >= SED; and Group 4: <150 min/wk
   of MVPA and LIPA < SB. 10-yr risk for a first ASCVD event was estimated
   using the pooled cohort equations.
   Results. After adjusting for age, gender, race-ethnicity and obesity,
   Group 2 (beta = -0.28; p = 0.44) was not significantly different than
   Group 1, but Groups 3 (beta = 1.09; p = 0.01) and 4 (beta = 1.44; p <
   0.001) had a higher pooled risk score.
   Conclusions. Those in the least desirable movement pattern (Group 4) had
   the highest pooled risk score. Given the similar risk scores for Groups
   1 and 2, future research is needed to determine if sufficient MVPA can
   counteract the potential consequences associated with an imbalanced
   LIPA: SB ratio (i.e., LIPA b SB). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Fast and accurate determination of the 3D structure of molecules is
   essential for better understanding their physical, chemical, and
   biological properties. We focus on an existing method for molecular
   structure determination: restrained molecular dynamics with simulated
   annealing. In this method a hybrid function, composed by a physical
   model and experimental restraints, is minimized by simulated annealing.
   Our goal is to accelerate computation time using commodity multi-core
   CPUs and GPUs in a heterogeneous computing model. We present a parallel
   and portable OpenCL implementation of this method. Experimental results
   are discussed in terms of accuracy, execution time, and parallel
   scalability. With respect to the XPLOR-NIH professional software
   package, compared to the single CPU core implementation, we obtain
   speedups of three to five times (increasing with problem size) on
   commodity GPUs. We achieve these performances by writing specialized
   kernels for different problem sizes and hardware architectures.}},

Abstract = {{I argue that there are, according to Aristotle, two importantly
   different kinds of goals or ends in the domain of human agency and that
   one of these two kinds has been frequently, though not universally,
   overlooked. Apart from psychological goals, goals that agents adopt as
   their purposes, there are also, I submit, goals that actions have by
   being the kinds of actions they are and, in some cases, by occurring in
   the circumstances in which they do. These latter goals belong to
   suitable actions whether or not agents adopt them as purposes and
   whether or not agents are aware of them. There is evidence both in
   Aristotle's ethical writings and in his discussion of chance and luck in
   Physics II. 4-6 that he recognizes goals of this latter kind.}},

Abstract = {{Initial triggers for diabetic retinopathy (DR) are hyperglycemia-induced
   oxidative stress and advanced glycation end-products. The most
   pathological structural changes occur in retinal microvasculature, but
   the overall development of DR is multifactorial, with a complex
   interplay of microvascular, neurodegenerative, genetic/epigenetic,
   immunological, and secondary inflammation-related factors. Although
   several individual factors and pathways have been associated with
   retinopathy, a systems level understanding of the disease is lacking. To
   address this, we performed mass spectrometry based label-free
   quantitative proteomics analysis of 138 vitreous humor samples from
   patients with nonproliferative DR or the more severe proliferative form
   of the disease. Additionally, we analyzed samples from anti-VEGF
   (vascular endothelial growth factor) (bevacizumab)-treated patients from
   both groups. In our study, we identified 2482 and quantified the
   abundancy of 1351 vitreous proteins. Of these, the abundancy of 230
   proteins was significantly higher in proliferative retinopathy compared
   with nonproliferative retinopathy. This specific subset of proteins was
   linked to inflammation, complement, and coagulation cascade proteins,
   protease inhibitors, apolipoproteins, immunoglobulins, and cellular
   adhesion molecules, reflecting the multifactorial nature of the disease.
   The identification of the key molecules of the disease is critical for
   the development of new therapeutic molecules and for the new use of
   existing drugs. Label free quantification}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{17-23}},

Abstract = {{Coping and child behaviour problems (CBP) predict psychological distress
   in caregivers of children with autism. Whether CBP mediate the
   relationship between coping and caregivers' psychological functioning
   has yet to be determined. This was the aim of the current study. A
   sample of 56 caregivers of children with autism completed an electronic
   survey assessing perceived stress, disengaged and problem focused
   coping, and CBP. Disengaged and problem focused coping predicted both
   CBP and perceived stress, albeit in different directions. CBP was also
   predictive of perceived stress. Data revealed an indirect effect of both
   disengaged and problem focused coping on perceived stress through CBP.
   In conclusion, caregivers who use more disengaged coping might be less
   effective at managing the problematic behaviours of the child with
   autism, thus resulting in poorer psychological functioning. Conversely,
   caregivers who use more problem focused strategies might, due to fewer
   CBP, be relatively protected against the psychological sequelae
   associated with the caregiving experience. Whether interventions that
   enhance problem focused coping have adaptive effects for caregivers'
   psychological functioning, and whether these effects are mediated by
   fewer CBP might be the focus of subsequent research. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to investigate the inhibitory ability of
   -hydroxyisovaleryl-shikonin (beta-HIVS) on the proliferation of human
   cervical cancer HeLa cells and to identify the mechanism of this effect.
   The HeLa cells were treated with -HIVS and the inhibition of cell growth
   was detected by an MTT assay. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze
   the apoptosis rate and cell cycle distribution of HeLa cells. Reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were
   used to examine the expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
   (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
   signaling pathway proteins. The results revealed that -HIVS inhibited
   HeLa cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. With the
   administration of increasing concentrations of -HIVS, the apoptotic rate
   of HeLa cells was also increased. The cell cycle was slightly arrested
   at the S phase, with similar to 6\% of cells in this phase, subsequent
   to treatment with 10 mu M -HIVS. In addition, -HIVS markedly reduced the
   expression levels of PI3K, AKT, mTOR and 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6
   kinase in HeLa cells. -HIVS promoted cervical cancer cell apoptosis by
   inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and suppressing
   downstream gene expression. The present study is expected to lead to the
   development of molecular targeted therapy for this signaling pathway as
   a novel method of cervical cancer treatment.}},

Journal = {{WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{996-1001}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Burnout is a syndrome of depersonalization, emotional
   exhaustion and sense of low personal accomplishment. Emergency
   physicians (EPs) experience the highest levels of burnout among all
   physicians. Burnout is associated with greater rates of self-reported
   suboptimal care among surgeons and internists. The association between
   burnout and suboptimal care among EPs is unknown. The objective of the
   study was to evaluate burnout rates among attending and resident EPs and
   examine their relationship with self-reported patient care practices.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study burnout was measured at two
   university-based emergency medicine residency programs with the Maslach
   Burnout Inventory. We also measured depression, quality of life (QOL)
   and career satisfaction using validated questionnaires. Six items
   assessed suboptimal care and the frequency with which they were
   performed.
   Results: We included 77 out of 155 (49.7\%) responses. The EP burnout
   rate was 57.1\%, with no difference between attending and resident
   physicians. Residents were more likely to screen positive for depression
   (47.8\% vs 18.5\%, p= 0.012) and report lower QOL scores (6.7 vs 7.4 out
   of 10, p= 0.036) than attendings. Attendings and residents reported
   similar rates of career satisfaction (85.2\% vs 87.0\%, p= 0.744).
   Burnout was associated with a positive screen for depression (38.6\% vs
   12.1\%, p= 0.011) and lower career satisfaction (77.3\% vs 97.0\%, p=
   0.02). EPs with high burnout were significantly more likely to report
   performing all six acts of suboptimal care.
   Conclusion: A majority of EPs demonstrated high burnout. EP burnout was
   significantly associated with higher frequencies of self-reported
   suboptimal care. Future efforts to determine if provider burnout is
   associated with negative changes in actual patient care are necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The white-light phosphors consisting of dysprosium doped yttrium
   aluminate were synthesized by the chemical co-precipitation method with
   the suitable thermal treatments. After one-hour thermal treatment in the
   air atmosphere, the white-light phosphor with particle size around 120
   nm can be obtained. The XRD patterns reveal that the aluminate-based
   phosphors are the mixtures of YAlO3 (YAP) and Y4Al2O9 (YAM). From the
   PLE spectra, five absorption peaks locating at 294, 325, 352, 363 and
   387 nm can be observed. These peaks appear due to the following electron
   transitions, H-6(15/2) -> K-4(13/2), H-6(15/2) -> K-4(16/2), H-6(15/2)
   -> K-4(16/2), H-6(15/2) -> M-4(15/2) + P-6(7/2), H-6(15/2) -> I-4(11/2)
   and H-6(15/2) -> M-6(19/2), respectively. Additionally, two emission
   peaks locating at 484 nm (blue-light) and 576 nm (yellow-light) can be
   observed in the PL spectra and they originate from the electron
   transitions, F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2) and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2). The
   optimal PL intensity of YAlO3 phosphors can be obtained with 1\%
   dysprosium ions. When the concentration of Dy3+ ions increases to 1.2\%,
   the concentration quenching effect is observed. According to the CIE
   diagram, the coordinates of YAlO3:Dy3+ phosphors locate within the
   white-light area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to obtain comprehensive microRNA
   (miRNA) profiles of type I {[}Ishikawa (ISK)] and type II (HEC-1B) human
   endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines, utilizing the latest
   high-throughput sequencing techniques. RNA was extracted from ISK and
   HEC-1B cell lines. Sequencing results were obtained from a
   next-generation sequencing platform. Using the miRBase database and a
   series of software pipelines, miRNA expression was analyzed in the ISK
   and HEC-1B cell lines. It was revealed that the type and quantity of
   miRNAs in the two cell types varied significantly; 34 miRNAs were
   upregulated and 105 miRNAs were downregulated in HEC-1B cells compared
   with those of ISK cells. Furthermore, it was observed that the
   expression pattern of the miRNA (miR)-17-92 cluster differed between the
   two cell types, and the expression levels of the miR-200 family in ISK
   cells were markedly increased compared with those of HEC-1B cells. The
   present study therefore identified potential novel biomarkers, which may
   be useful in the differentiation between type I and type II endometrial
   cancer, and also revealed miRNA alterations that may be associated with
   endometrial cancer and its underlying pathogenic mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Wind energy is a kind of renewable and clean energy, and wind power is a
   non-hydropower renewable energy which has the best technical and
   economic conditions for large-scale development. It is characterized by
   fluctuation, intermittency, low energy density, etc., so wind power is
   also fluctuating. When a large-scale wind farm is connected to a power
   grid, great fluctuation in wind power will cause adverse effect to the
   power balance and frequency adjustment of the power grid. If the
   generation power of the wind farm can be prediction, the electricity
   dispatch department can arrange dispatch plans in advance according to
   the change in wind power and better protect the power balance and
   operation safety of the power grid. In this article, a SVM model is used
   to predict wind power and modified PSO is used to optimize SVM
   parameters, realizing the optimized selection of the SVM model
   parameters, which makes such prediction more close to actual law. Actual
   calculation examples shows that the prediction method used in the
   article has good convergence, high prediction precision and actual
   application value.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: There is no approved special endovascular device for use in
   preventing entry tears in the distal part of ascending aorta or in the
   aortic arch and preserving the arch branch arteries. Thus, we have
   designed a novel branched stent-graft, and herein report the initial
   clinical outcomes.
   Methods: Between August 2009 and January 2014, 51 patients with aortic
   dissections involving the aortic arch were treated by endovascular
   branched stent-grafts. There were 7 Stanford type A aortic dissections,
   22 retrograde type A aortic dissections, and 22 Stanford type B aortic
   dissections (including 4 localized aortic arch dissections). All
   patients were treated while in the chronic phase (>2 weeks).
   Results: All of the proximal entry tears in the arch were successfully
   excluded, and all of the treated branch arteries remained patent. No new
   cerebral infarction occurred. There was 1 death from a retrograde type A
   dissection, occurring 6 days after the endovascular procedure. The
   median follow-up period was 44 months (range, 14-66 months). No
   additional complications or mortality occurred. Complete thrombosis in
   the false lumen of the aortic arch was formed in all patients, and
   significant true lumen recovery and false lumen shrinkage were
   demonstrated in different levels of the thoracic aorta according to
   computed tomography angiography at 1 year postsurgery (P<.001).
   Conclusions: In patients with aortic dissection involving the arch
   branches, the customized branched stent-graft may provide a feasible
   endovascular treatment option. A larger series of cases with longer
   follow-up is needed to substantiate these results.}},

Abstract = {{With diversified requirements and varying manufacturing environments,
   the optimal production planning for a steelmill becomes more flexible
   and complicated. The flexibility provides operators with auxiliary
   requirements through an implementable integrated production planning. In
   this paper, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is
   proposed for the optimal planning that incorporates various
   manufacturing constraints and flexibility in a steel plate mill.
   Furthermore, two solution strategies are developed to overcome the
   weakness in solving the MINLP problem directly. The first one is to
   transform the original MINLP formulation to an approximate mixed integer
   linear programming using a classic linearization method. The second one
   is to decompose the original model using a branch-and-bound based
   iterative method. Computational experiments on various instances are
   presented in terms of the effectiveness and applicability. The result
   shows that the second method performs better in computational efforts
   and solution accuracy. (C) 2015 The Chemical Industry and Engineering

Abstract = {{Aim: The expression of aromatase (via CYP19 and the CYP19 PII promoter)
   and the orphan nuclear receptor family members, liver receptor
   homologue-1 (LRH-1) and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) in cultured
   luteinized granulosa cells from women with endometriosis were
   investigated.
   Methods: Luteinized granulosa cells from patients undergoing in vitro
   fertilization (16 patients with endometriosis and 28 controls) were
   examined for messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of CYP19,
   CYP19 PII, LRH-1 and SF-1, determined by quantitative reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Student's t-test, the
   Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's rank correlation were used for
   statistical analysis.
   Results: The number of high quality embryos in the endometriosis group
   was significantly lower than in the control group. The mRNA expression
   levels of CYP19, CYP19 PII, LRH-1 and SF-1 in granulosa-lutein cells
   were decreased in women with endometriosis compared to the control
   group. The simultaneous down-regulation expression of LRH-1, SF-1 and
   CYP19 PII in endometriotic granulosa cells indicated their positive
   correlation.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrate aberrant expressions of SF-1 and
   LRH-1 in endometriotic granulosa-lutein cells. This finding may be
   helpful in understanding infertility associated with endometriosis and
   reduced P450 aromatase activity in endometriotic granulosa cells.}},

Abstract = {{The precise cable drive has been widely used in all types of industrial,

   drive. However, the classical capstan equation cannot hold for precise
   cable drive because of the existing bending stiffness and elastic
   elongation of the steel cable. This paper develops analytical methods
   for predicting the transmission capability of precise cable drive
   including bending rigidity. This work illustrates interconnections
   between the transmission capability and design parameters, including
   preload force, wrapped angle, capstan radius ratio, bending stiffness
   and friction coefficient. The result is useful to predict the

   calculations are used to validate the proposed FEM model, and some key
   parameters including the penetration resistance, the height of soil plug
   under different suctions and the bucket wall friction are examined. The
   numerical results show that the ALE technique is capable of simulating
   the suction bucket penetration without mesh distortion problems. The
   installation method can significantly affect the penetration resistance,
   namely, the suction penetration can reduces the resistance significantly
   compared to the purely jacked penetration. In addition, it is found that
   as the final suction increases, the penetration resistance reduces and
   the soil plug height increases. It is also shown that the internal
   friction has a significant contribution to the penetration resistance
   and the properties of soil-bucket wall friction exert more significant
   impact on the purely jacketed penetration than on the suction
   penetration.}},

Abstract = {{Dysfunctional Omi/HtrA2, a mitochondrial serine protease, has been
   implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders. Despite the wealth of
   evidence on the roles of Omi/HtrA2 in apoptosis, little is known about
   its cytosolic targets, the cleavage of which could account for the
   observed morphological changes such as cytoskeletal reorganizations in
   axons. By proteomic analysis, vimentin was identified as a substrate for
   Omi/HtrA2 and we have reported increased Omi/HtrA2 protease activity in
   Alzheimer disease (AD) brain. Here, we investigated a possible link
   between Omi/HtrA2 and vimentin cleavage, and consequence of this
   cleavage on mitochondrial distribution in neurons. In vitro protease
   assays showed vimentin to be cleaved by Omi/HtrA2 protease, and
   proximity ligation assay demonstrated an increased interaction between
   Omi/HtrA2 and vimentin in human primary neurons upon stress stimuli.
   Using differentiated neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, we showed that
   Omi/HtrA2 under several different stress conditions induces cleavage of
   vimentin in wild-type as well as SH-SY5Y cells transfected with amyloid
   precursor protein with the Alzheimer disease-associated Swedish
   mutation. After stress treatment, inhibition of Omi/HtrA2 protease
   activity by the Omi/HtrA2 specific inhibitor, Ucf-101, reduced the
   cleavage of vimentin in wild-type cells. Following altered vimentin
   filaments integrity by stress stimuli, mitochondria was redistributed in
   differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and human primary neurons. In summary, the
   findings outlined in this paper suggest a role of Omi/HtrA2 in
   modulation of vimentin filamentous structure in neurons. Our results
   provide important findings for understanding the biological role of
   Omi/HtrA2 activity during stress conditions, and give knowledge of
   interplay between Omi/HtrA2 and vimentin which might affect
   mitochondrial distribution in neurons.}},

Abstract = {{Results from the 2011 Mw 9.1 Tohoku-Oki megathrust earthquake display a
   complex rupture pattern, with most of the high-frequency energy radiated
   from the downdip edge of the seismogenic zone and very little from the
   large shallow rupture. Current seismic results of smaller earthquakes in
   this region are confusing due to disagreements among event catalogs on
   both the event locations (> 30 km horizontally) and mechanisms. Here we
   present an in-depth study of a series of intraslab earthquakes that
   occurred in a localized region near the downdip edge of the main shock.
   We explore the validity of 1D velocity model and refine earthquake
   source parameters for selected key events by performing broadband
   waveform modeling combining regional networks. These refined source
   parameters are then used to calibrate paths and further simulate
   secondary source properties, such as rupture directivity and fault
   dimension. Calculation of stress changes caused by the main event
   indicate that the region where these intraslab events occurred are prone
   to thrust events. This group of intraslab earthquakes suggest the
   reactivation of a subducted normal fault, and are potentially useful in
   enhancing our understanding on the downdip shear zone and large
   outer-rise events.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Formulas do not estimate renal function with acceptable
   precision and accuracy. Methods. We compared 51 creatinine-based and/or
   cystatin c-based formulas with a gold standard (iohexol plasma
   clearance) in 193 renal transplant recipients using concordance
   correlation coefficient, total deviation index, coverage probability and
   the error in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage classification. Results.
   No formula showed a concordance correlation coefficient greater than
   0.90 (average for creatinine-based formulas: similar to 0.70 and for
   cystatin c-based formulas: similar to 0.85). A wide total deviation
   index was observed: approximately 70\% (creatinine-based) and
   approximately 50\% (cystatin c-based), indicating that 90\% of the
   estimations showed bounds of error of +/- 70\% or +/- 50\%,
   respectively, compared with the gold standard. No formula included 90\%
   of the estimations within a coverage probability of +/- 10\%. Half the
   CKD stages classified by creatinine-based formulas were incorrect,
   mainly due to overestimation of renal function. One of 3 CKD stages
   diagnosed by cystatin c-based formulas was incorrect, with both
   overestimation and underestimation. Overall, the formulas showed very
   low precision and accuracy and a high degree of error in reflecting real
   renal function. Conclusions. In conclusion, formulas do not properly
   reflect renal function in kidney transplantation, which makes their use
   in clinical practice unreliable. Moreover, their use in clinical trials
   should be avoided.}},

Title = {{Odor Perception in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and its
   Relationship to Food Neophobia}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Atypical sensory functioning in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been
   well documented in the last decade for the visual, tactile and auditory
   systems, but olfaction in ASD is still understudied. The aim of the
   present study was to examine whether children with ASD and
   neuro-typically (NT) developed children differed in odor perception, at
   the cognitive (familiarity and identification ability), sensorimotor
   (olfactory exploration) and affective levels (hedonic evaluation).
   Because an important function of the sense of smell is its involvement
   in eating, from food selection to appreciation and recognition, a
   potential link between odor perception and food neophobia was also
   investigated. To these ends, 10 children between 6 and 13 years old
   diagnosed with ASD and 10 NT control children were tested. To compare
   performance, 16 stimuli were used and food neophobia was assessed by the
   parents on a short food neophobia scale. Results revealed that (i)
   significant hedonic discrimination between attractive and aversive odors
   was observed in NT (p = 0.005; d = 2.378) and ASD children (p = 0.042; d
   = 0.941), and (ii) hedonic discrimination level was negatively
   correlated with food neophobia scores in ASD (p = 0.007) but not NT
   children. In conclusion, this study offers new insights into odor
   perception in ASD children, highlighting a relationship between odor
   hedonic reactivity and eating behavior. This opens up new perspectives
   on both (i) the role of olfaction in the construction of eating behavior
   in ASD children, and (ii) the measurement and meaning of food neophobia
   in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetable or synthetic lubricants, also called biolubricants, are less

   biodegradability of bio-based lubricants using a bio-kinetic model
   (without microorganisms), comparing their performances with fresh
   vegetable oil and mineral oil. The results are presented through an
   Effective Composition for Biodegradation (ECB), half-lives and
   biodegradation time profile. The synthesized biolubricants showed ECB
   values closer to vegetable oil than mineral oil. Half-life times are
   approximately 12 days for fresh vegetable oil, around 20-30 days for the

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{89-94}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The body of a mediaeval monarch was always under scrutiny, and Richard
   III's was no exception. In death, however, his body became subject to
   new forms of examination and interpretation: stripped naked after the
   battle of Bosworth, his corpse was carried to Leicester and exhibited
   before being buried. In 2012, it was rediscovered. The revelation that
   Richard suffered from scoliosis prompts this article to re-evaluate the
   historical sources about Richard's physique and his posthumous
   reputation. This article argues that Richard's death and his myth as
   `crookback' are inextricably linked and traces attitudes to spinal
   curvature in the early modern period. It also considers how Shakespeare
   represented Richard as deformed, and aspects of performance history
   which suggest physical vulnerability. It then considers Richard's
   scoliosis from the perspective of medical history, reviewing classical
   accounts of scoliosis and arguing that Richard was probably treated with
   a mixture of axial traction and pressure. It demonstrates from the
   evidence of Richard's medical household that he was well placed to
   receive hands-on therapies and considers in particular the role of his
   physician and surgeon, William Hobbes. Finally, it shows how the case of
   Richard III demonstrates the close relationship between politics and
   medicine in the period and the contorted process of historical myth
   making.}},

   long-term follow-up of a single consecutive institutional series of 30

Abstract = {{Object The aim of this study is to delineate the long-term results for
   patients going through surgery for pediatric brain tumors in the first 6
   months of life.
   Thirty consecutive children (1-182 days old) who underwent primary
   resection for a brain tumor during the years 1973-2012 were included in
   this retrospective study on surgical morbidity, mortality rate, academic
   achievement, and/or work participation. Gross motor function and
   activities of daily life were scored according to the Barthel index.
   Of the 30 patients, 11 children had surgery in the first 3 months of
   life (1 to 88 days) and 19 were aged 3 to 6 months (94-182 days) at the
   time of surgery. The male/female ratio was 1.0 (15/15). No patients were
   lost to follow-up. Two patients died in the postoperative period (30
   days). Another eight patients died during the follow-up. Twenty patients
   are alive, with follow-up times from 2 to 38 years, median 13 years.
   Among the 28 children who survived the primary resection, eight
   underwent repeat surgery from 6 months to 5 years after the first
   operation. Two children were operated three times, and one of these also
   a fourth time. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 20 of the
   primary resections, subtotal resection (STR) in 6, and in the last 4,
   only a biopsy or a partial resection was performed.
   Nine children received adjuvant chemotherapy and three of these also
   radiotherapy (in the years 1979-1987). Among the 20 survivors, the
   Barthel index is normal (100) in 18 patients, 40 in one, and 20 in the
   last one. Eight tumors were located to the posterior fossa, and 22 were
   supratentorial. Eighteen tumors were histologically low-grade (WHO grade
   I-II), most of these were plexus papillomas (7) or astrocytomas (7), and
   12 were high-grade (WHO grade III-IV); PNET/medulloblastomas (6),
   ependymoma (2), glioblastoma (2), teratoma, and plexus carcinoma.
   Infants with brain tumors may clearly benefit from surgical resection
   with favorable results even for prolonged periods of time. Ten children
   died, two of them with prolonged survival for 9 and 29 years. Among the
   20 survivors, a stable very long-term result appears obtainable in 18
   also when it comes to quality of life. Four of the survivors have been
   treated for highly malignant tumors with a follow-up of 5, 11, 14, and
   26 years. One of our infant patients treated for GBM in 1982, lived for
   29 years, however, with a progressive decline in the quality of life
   probably due to postoperative whole-brain radiation.}},

   seen as a ``perturbation from the bosonic end{''}. We model this
   situation in the magnetic gauge picture by bosons interacting through
   long-range magnetic potentials. We assume that these effective
   statistical gauge potentials are generated by magnetic charges carried
   by each particle, smeared over discs of radius R (extended anyons). Our
   method allows to take not too fast at the same time as . In this limit
   we rigorously justify the so-called ``average field approximation{''}:
   the particles behave like independent, identically distributed bosons

Abstract = {{Resistance to temozolomide poses a major clinical challenge in
   glioblastoma multiforme treatment, and the mechanisms underlying the
   development of temozolomide resistance remain poorly understood.
   Enhanced DNA repair and mutagenesis can allow tumour cells to survive,
   contributing to resistance and tumour recurrence. Here, using recurrent
   temozolomide-refractory glioblastoma specimens, temozolomide-resistant
   cells, and resistant-xenograft models, we report that loss of miR-29c
   via c-Myc drives the acquisition of temozolomide resistance through
   enhancement of REV3L-mediated DNA repair and mutagenesis in
   glioblastoma. Importantly, disruption of c-Myc/miR-29c/REV3L signalling
   may have dual anticancer effects, sensitizing the resistant tumours to
   therapy as well as preventing the emergence of acquired temozolomide
   resistance. Our findings suggest a rationale for targeting the
   c-Myc/miR-29c/REV3L signalling pathway as a promising therapeutic
   approach for glioblastoma, even in recurrent, treatment-refractory
   settings.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of extracellular enzyme activities in particle-size
   fractions of sediments was investigated in a subtropical mangrove
   ecosystem. Five enzymes involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and
   phosphorus (P) cycling were analyzed in the sand, silt, and clay of
   sediments. Among these fractions, the highest activities of phenol
   oxidase (PHO), beta-D-glucosidase (GLU), and N-acetyl-glucosiminidase
   (NAG) were found in sand, and greater than bulk sediments of both
   intertidal zone (IZ) and mangrove forest (MG). This result implied that
   sand fractions might protect selective enzymes through the adsorption
   without affecting their activities. Additionally, the enzyme-based
   resource allocation in various particle-size fractions demonstrated that
   nutrients availability varied with different particle-size fractions and
   only sand fraction of MG with highest total C showed high N and P
   availability among fractions. Besides, the analysis between elemental
   contents and enzyme activities in particle size fractions suggested that
   enzymes could monitor the changes of nutrients availability and be good
   indicators of ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Thus, these
   results provided a means to assess the availability of different
   nutrients (C, N, and P) during decomposition of sediment organic matter
   (SOM), and thus helping to better manage the subtropical mangrove
   ecosystems to sequester C into SOM.}},

   identify and analyze the complete spectrum of compromise aggregation
   operators that can be used to model the various attitudes that
   decision-making agents can have toward risk in aggregation. In this
   paper, we extend these operators to deal with aggregation when the
   ratings have different degrees of importance. Specifically, we
   generalize the method of weighted uninorms to handle this issue. We
   choose this approach because uninorm compromise operators are a kind of
   common ones, and their weighted counterparts, which are widely accepted,
   can cover other common operators, such as weighted t-norms and
   t-conorms, as special cases. As per the analysis of weighted uninorms,
   we identify common properties that the weighting operators of the
   various compromise operators should satisfy, and in so doing, we
   introduce the concept of a general weighting operator for compromise
   operators and reveal the different properties that a specific type of
   weighting operator should obey. This, in turn, defines the concepts of
   the various weighting operators of the various compromise operators. We
   then go onto discuss the construction issue of weighting operators
   associated with the various compromise operators.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare two-dimensional digital
   subtraction angiography (2D-DSA) with C-arm cone-beam volume computed
   tomography (CACT) in the evaluation of portal vein entry and shunt
   course during transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
   procedure.
   Between May 2010 and November 2011, 21 patients who underwent direct
   portography in anteroposterior and lateral projections and subsequent
   CACT before stent placement during TIPS creation were reviewed
   retrospectively. CACT images were examined for evaluation of the portal
   vein entry and shunt course in comparison to 2D-DSA images by two
   experienced interventional radiologists.
   CACT was proven to be better than 2D-DSA in identification of the portal
   vein entry (P < 0.001) and intra- or extrahepatic puncture (P < 0.001).
   No significant difference was observed in evaluating the shunt course (P
   = 0.086). The portal vein entry was considered inappropriate in seven
   (33 \%) out of 21 patients; among them, four cases were due to
   extrahepatic puncture, and three cases were due to peripheral puncture
   of the portal vein which may result in stent kinking.
   While 2D-DSA remains the standard imaging method to evaluate portal vein
   entry, shunt course, and portal vein anatomy during TIPS procedure, CACT
   can effectively identify the portal vein entry and assess shunt course
   in difficult cases intra-procedurally, hence may reduce the risk of
   potential life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage and shunt
   dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{The barbershop is a promising setting where African-American men might
   receive information and education about prostate cancer. In this study,
   we assessed the feasibility of engaging rural barbershops as venues for
   barbers to deliver a prostate cancer education intervention to increase
   informed decision-making for prostate cancer screening among customers.
   Twelve barbershops were recruited from two separate micropolitan areas
   in Georgia as intervention and control sites. Structured interviews were
   conducted with 11 barbers in both sites about customer characteristics
   as well as their willingness to participate in the study. The interviews
   were audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. In the intervention
   site, six barbers completed a survey and a pre-/posttest prostate cancer
   knowledge instrument following training classes. Barbers reported a wide
   average range of customers served per week (50 to 300). African-American
   men made up an average of 87 \% of customers. Barbers thought prostate
   cancer was an important discussion topic, felt they would be comfortable
   discussing it, and supported the participation of their barbershop in
   the study. For intervention group barbers, there was a statistically
   significant difference between the average pretest knowledge score of 72
   \% (mean 12.2, SD = 3.2) and the posttest knowledge score of 89 \% (mean
   15.2, SD = 1.1) (P = 0.03) on the 17-item prostate cancer knowledge
   instrument. Based on the multiple interactions with the barbers, there
   was high receptivity to the topic and consensus about the importance of
   addressing prostate cancer with their customers. Rural barbershops
   represent feasible venues for delivering a prostate cancer education
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. - Renal ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common reason
   of acute kidney injury. Apoptosis play an important role in the IRI.
   Fenofibrate, one of agonist Peroxisome proliferator-activated
   receptor-alpha (PPAR alpha) has the effect of anti-apoptosis. This study
   was to explore the effect of Fenofibrate on renal ischemia reperfusion
   injury and its mechanism.
   Materials and methods. - IRI was induced by bilateral renal ischemia for
   45 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Eighteen male C57BL/6 mice were
   randomly divided into three groups: Sham group (Sham), IRI group (IRI),
   I/R-Fenofibrate group (FEN). Fenofibrate was injected at 45 min before
   renal ischemia. Renal histology, function, and the expression of Bax,
   Bcl-2, Bcl-xl p21, p53, Caspse3, CytC, p-JAK2, p-STAT3 and p-PPAR-alpha
   were assessed.
   Results. - Fenofibrate precondition can significantly alleviate the
   renal dysfunction, the pathological change, up-regulate the expression
   of p-PPAR-alpha, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Caspase3 and down-regulate the
   expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, p53, p21, CytC and Bax induced by renal
   IR injury.
   Conclusion. - Fenofibrate precondition can protect mice against IRI by
   suppressing p53-mediating apoptosis which was associated with inhibiting
   JAK2/STAT3 signaling activation though further activating PPAR-alpha.
   Our findings suggest that Fenofibrate could be useful for preventing
   IR-induced renal injury. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{The article deals with the history of the formation of military
   regiments from the runaway old believers who returned to Russia. In the
   18th century, the authorities tried to prevent Russian people escapes
   abroad. A large number of runaways were old believers who escaped from
   religious persecution. A major center of runaway old believers
   settlement was Vietka, a then Polish town. During the 18th century
   imperial manifestos and decrees were published. They called for
   fugitives to return home. The returning were absolved from blames.
   Peasant old believers were allowed to choose their status when they
   returned to Russia. They could go back to landlords who owned them
   before the escape or become state peasants. However, calls for a return
   to Russia did not lead to a massive return of old believers. Therefore,
   a military operation was organized to return runaways from abroad. In
   1764, by a decree of Catherine II, a Russian detachment led by Major
   General Maslov returned the fugitive old believers from Poland to
   Russia. This operation was called ``vygonki{''} {[}driving-out]. The
   returned old believers were sent to military service. Those who were not
   fit for the service were sent to a settlement. Places of settlements
   were limited by an imperial decree. The special registry of places
   allowed for settlement included the Siberian lands near Tobolsk, in
   Barabinsk steppe, along the banks of the Uba, Ulba, Beryozovka,
   Glubokaya and other tributaries of the Irtysh River, in the area of
   Ust-Kamenogorsk fortress. A significant number of old believers who
   returned from Poland settled in Uba, Ust-Kamenogorsk and Krutoberezovsk
   regions. They were resettled in the status of state peasants. As for the
   regiments, it was planned to form five infantry (Irkutsk, Selenginsk,
   Nerchinsk, Tomsk and Yenisei) and two cavalry (Yakut and Tyumen) ones.
   The rules for selection of recruits included age, height, health status.
   The recruits were provided with uniforms and meals. However, the
   returned old believers were not prepared for military service. So it was
   really possible to form only two regiments of them: Tomsk and
   Selenginsk. They included the total of 1803 people. Together with their
   families there were 3955 people. They were housed in Selenginsk
   (Selenginsk Regiment) and in Ust-Kamenogorsk fortress (Tomsk Regiment).}},

Abstract = {{Classroom acoustics not always take the speaker's comfort into
   consideration. The purpose of the presented papers was to investigate
   voice use, vocal behavior and prevalence of voice problems in Swedish
   teaching staff. Ratings of features in the work-environment on voice use
   were explored in n = 487 teachers. Based on their answers the
   respondents were split into two groups: teachers with self-assessed
   voice problems and voice-healthy teachers. Teachers with voice problems
   and were matched to a voice-healthy colleague from the same school and
   were investigated and compared for clinical findings and for vocal
   behavior. Acoustic properties of their teaching environments were
   measured. Teachers with voice-problems were more affected by any loading
   factor in the work-environment and were more aware of the room
   acoustics. Differences between the groups were found during
   field-measurements, while there were no differences in the findings from
   the clinical examinations of the larynx and voice. Voice problems seem
   to emerge in the interplay with and use of the classroom acoustics.}},

Abstract = {{A thorough understanding of the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome
   (IHES) and further optimization of diagnostic work-up procedures are
   warranted. We analyzed purified eosinophils from patients with IHES by
   next-generation whole-exome sequencing and compared DNA methylation
   profiles from reactive eosinophilic conditions to known clonal and
   suspected clonal eosinophilia. Somatic missense mutations in
   cancer-related genes were detected in three IHES patients. These
   included the spliceosome gene PUF60 and the cadherin gene CDH17.
   Furthermore, reactive eosinophilia samples could be differentiated from
   known-and suspected clonal eosinophilia samples based on 285
   differentially methylated CpG sites corresponding to 128 differentially
   methylated genes. Using Ingenuity pathway analysis, we found that
   differentially methylated genes were highly enriched in functional
   pathways such as cancer, cell death and survival, and hematological
   disease. Our data show that a subset of IHES may be of clonal origin not
   related to the classical molecular aberrations of FGFR, PDGFRA/B, or
   T-cells, and that the initiating hits could be point mutations in a
   variety of genes, including spliceosome mutations or hypermethylated
   tumor suppressor genes. In addition, we identified a DNA methylation
   signature that is relevant for distinguishing clonal and suspected
   clonal eosinophilia from reactive eosinophilia per se, which may be
   useful in daily clinical work.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal model of energy storage elements such as batteries or
   supercapacitors (SCs) can be used as a platform to predict thermal
   behavior of the elements, which is essential from the point of view of
   monitoring and diagnostics. While the lumped thermal model for a single
   cylindrical SC cell and its extension to multicells string or module
   have been covered in technical literature, the multicells model has not
   been experimentally validated. This paper presents experimental
   validation of the existing lumped thermal model of multicylindrical
   cells based on an experimental setup of a forced cooled SC string
   consisting of eight 650 F cells. The determination of the parameters of
   such a thermal model is discussed and the validated model is used as a
   basis to design a closed-loop observer for estimating string
   temperature. Experimental results are presented to confirm its
   applicability for predicting instantaneous temperatures of each cell in
   the string.}},

Abstract = {{In the present prospective study, the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) levels
   on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were investigated in 30
   patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and in 20
   healthy controls (HCs). The relationship between TLR4 levels and the
   occurrence of cerebral vasospasm (CVS) was also analyzed. TLR4
   expression level on cell surface of PBMCs on days 1, 3, and 7 after
   admission was determined by flow cytometry. Results showed that patients
   with aSAH presented a significantly higher TLR4 levels. For patients
   with Hunt-Hess grades IV-V, higher TLR4 levels were also observed;
   higher TLR4 levels have already been seen in patients developing CVS
   and/or delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Higher TLR4 levels were also
   associated with modified Fisher score, occurrence of dCVS, DCI, cerebral
   infarction (CT), and poor neurological functional recovery. Binary
   logistic regression analysis indicated that high TLR4 expression on
   blood monocytes was an independent predictive factor of the occurrence
   of dCVS, DCI, and poor neurological functional recovery. Taken together,
   TLR4 levels on PBMCs is significantly altered in the early stage of
   aSAH, especially in those patients experiencing CVS and DCI.
   Furthermore, higher TLR4 levels in the early stage of aSAH is also
   associated with the neurological function outcome. As far as we know,
   this is the first clinical study about TLR4's significance for patients
   with aSAH.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures are widely used in earthquake
   regions, and damage to these structures has been reported after many
   earthquakes. Small parts of seriously damaged RC frames should be
   demolished and reconstructed, and a large number of earthquake-damaged
   RC frames can be retrofitted and used again. In this paper, the seismic
   behavior of predamaged reinforced concrete columns repaired using
   early-strength cement mortar and basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP)
   has been investigated through lateral reversed cyclic tests on seven
   large-sized RC columns. Two predamage levels {[}(1) moderate damage, and
   (2) severe damage] were assigned to the RC columns through cyclic
   loading. The axial load and residual displacement were kept constant
   during the retrofitting process, and the retrofitted columns were
   retested after 6 days of mortar and epoxy curing at room temperature.
   The ductility and energy dissipation capacities of the fiber-reinforced
   polymer (FRP)-retrofitted predamaged RC columns were greatly improved
   after early-strength cement mortar perfusion and BFRP wrapping compared
   with the original intact columns. The flexural capacity could be fully
   restored for the moderately predamaged RC column and partially restored
   for the severely predamaged column, whereas the initial elastic
   stiffness of the BFRP-retrofitted predamaged RC columns was lower than
   that of the original intact columns and deceased with increased
   predamage level. The influences of axial load, residual displacement,
   and predamage level on the repair effect of FRP-retrofitted predamaged
   RC columns were analyzed, and the predamage level was the main
   influencing factor. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{The reaction of a platinated methionine motif of CTR1 with cysteine and
   histidine is dependent upon the type of precursor platinum complex}},

Abstract = {{The human copper protein (hCTR1) is believed to facilitate the cellular
   uptake of cisplatin. Cisplatin likely binds to the methionine (Met)-rich
   motifs located in the N-terminus of hCTR1, and ligand exchange would be
   essential if cisplatin has to pass through the hCTR1 channel. In this
   work, we investigated the reaction between platinated adducts of a
   methionine-rich motif of yeast CTR1 (Mets7) and N-acetyl-cysteine
   (AcCys) or N-acetyl-histidine (AcHis), mimicking metal-binding residues
   downstream the CTR1 channel. Platination involved two cis-compounds,
   cisplatin and oxaliplatin, and one monofunctional complex,
   cisdiammine(pyridine)chloridoplatinum(II) (cDPCP). The reactions were
   monitored by HPLC and the products were characterized by ESI-MS. The
   results indicate different reactivities depending upon the platinum
   complex. The cisplatin/Mets7 adduct reacts readily with both cysteine
   and histidine (t(1/2) < 2 min). In contrast, the oxaliplatin/Mets7
   adduct reacts with cysteine but not with histidine, whereas cDPCP/Mets7
   adduct reacts with histidine but not with cysteine. Hence, Mets7 adducts
   of these platinum complexes exhibit different reactivities towards
   downstream coordinating amino acids. These results suggest that each
   platinum complex possesses different reactivities and consequently may
   lead to differences in their cellular distribution and bioactivity. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper we examined both theoretically and experimentally the
   diffraction field along the axis of propagation of the zero order Bessel
   distribution produced by an axicon. An axicon is typically used to
   obtain quasi nondiffracting beams. We found that an Arago-Poisson
   diffraction spot, normally only observed behind an opaque circular
   obstacle, can also be observed in the shadow area of an axicon lens.
   Both theoretical and experimental analysis indicate that the intensity
   distribution of the diffraction spot follows a zero order Bessel
   function in the paraxial region. The diffraction spot diameter increases
   linearly with the propagation distance in the shadow area while its
   energy decreases with propagation distance. The illuminated region and
   Arago-Poisson diffraction spot never overlap because the diameters of
   either increase linearly with propagation distance. Therefore, in
   theory, the Arago-Poisson diffraction spot could propagate to infinity.
   Our observation may be useful to produce an accurate straight line
   reference in commercial alignment systems.}},

Abstract = {{A novel line pilot differential protection principle based on the
   virtual impedance of fault component is proposed in this paper. First,
   according to the fault component of the measured current and voltage at
   both line ends, the fault component of the current and voltage at the
   line midpoint is calculated. Second, the virtual impedance is defined as
   the calculated voltage fault component divided by the calculated current
   fault component. And then, according to the two virtual impedances
   calculated at two line ends, the ratio restraint criterion is formed
   with the sum of the virtual impedances and the smaller virtual
   impedance. Finally, by analyzing different characteristics of the
   criterion in different fault cases, the fault can be identified.
   Simulation results verify that the proposed method is able to identify
   different kinds of fault accurately with high sensitivity. It is highly
   reliable and not affected by the fault location, transition resistance,
   load current, distributed capacitance, and data synchronization. Even in
   the case of transitional fault, selectivity can still be guaranteed with
   the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Consumption of high concentration of fluoride in the drinking water
   would cause the fluorosis and chronic pain. Similar pain syndrome
   appeared in the patients in fluoride therapy of osteoporotic. The aim of
   the current study was to examine whether exposing immature mice to
   fluoride would modify the peripheral pain sensitivity or even cause a
   pain syndrome. We gave developmental fluoride exposure to mice in
   different concentration (0 mg/L, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L) and evaluated
   their basal pain threshold. Von Frey hair test, hot plate test and
   formalin test were conducted to examine the mechanical, thermal
   nociceptive threshold and inflammatory pain, respectively. In addition,
   the expression of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
   was also evaluated by Western blotting. Hyperalgesia in fluoride
   exposure mice was exhibited in the Von Frey hair test, hot plate test
   and formalin test. Meanwhile, the expression of BDNF was significantly
   higher than that of control group. The results suggest that early
   developmental fluoride exposure may lower the basal pain threshold and
   be associated with the increasing of BDNF expression in hipppcampus. (C)

Title = {{Design and development of an ethnically-diverse imaging

Journal = {{COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{2, SI}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: MRI has been used to identify multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions
   in brain and spinal cord visually. Integrating patient information into
   an electronic patient record system has become key for modern patient
   care in medicine in recent years. Clinically, it is also necessary to
   track patients' progress in longitudinal studies, in order to provide
   comprehensive understanding of disease progression and response to
   treatment. As the amount of required data increases, there exists a need
   for an efficient systematic solution to store and analyze MS patient
   data, disease profiles, and disease tracking for both clinical and
   research purposes. Method: An imaging informatics based system, called
   MS eFolder, has been developed as an integrated patient record system
   for data storage and analyrsis of MS patients. The eFolder system, with
   a DICOMbased database, includes a module for lesion contouring by
   radiologists, a MS lesion quantification tool to quantify MS lesion
   volume in 3D, brain parenchyma fraction analysis, and provide
   quantitative analysis and tracking of volume changes in longitudinal
   studies. Patient data, including MR images, have been collected
   retrospectively at University of Southern California Medical Center
   (USC) and Los Angeles County Hospital (LAC). The MS eFolder utilizes
   web-based components, such as browser-based graphical user interface
   (GUI) and web-based database. The eFolder database stores patient
   clinical data (demographics, MS disease history, family history, etc.),
   MR imaging-related data found in DICOM headers, and lesion
   quantification results. Lesion quantification results are derived from
   radiologists' contours on brain MRI studies and quantified into
   3-dimensional volumes and locations. Quantified results of white matter
   lesions are integrated into a structured report based on DICOM-SR
   protocol and templates. The user interface displays patient clinical
   information, original MR images, and viewing structured reports of
   quantified results. The GUI also includes a data mining tool to handle
   unique search queries for MS. System workflow and dataflow steps has
   been designed based on the IHE post-processing workflow profile,
   including workflow process tracking, MS lesion contouring and
   quantification of MR images at a post-processing workstation, and
   storage of quantitative results as DICOM-SR in DICOM-based storage
   system. The web-based GUI is designed to display zero-footprint DICOM
   web-accessible data objects (WADO) and the SR objects. Summary: The MS
   eFolder system has been designed and developed as an integrated data
   storage and mining solution in both clinical and research environments,
   while providing unique features, such as quantitative lesion analysis
   and disease tracking over a longitudinal study. A comprehensive image
   and clinical data integrated database provided by MS eFolder provides a
   platform for treatment assessment, outcomes analysis and
   decision-support. The proposed system serves as a platform for future
   quantitative analysis derived automatically from CAD algorithms that can
   also be integrated within the system for individual disease tracking and
   future MS-related research. Ultimately the eFolder provides a decision-
   support infrastructure that can eventually be used as add-on value to
   the overall electronic medical record. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{CHINESE PHYSICS B}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the conductivity characteristics in the surface
   accumulation layer of a junctionless nanowire transistor fabricated by
   the femtosecond laser lithography on a heavily n-doped
   silicon-on-insulator wafer. The conductivity of the accumulation region
   is totally suppressed when the gate voltage is more positive than the
   flatband voltage. The extracted low field electron mobility in the
   accumulation layer is estimated to be 1.25 cm(2).V-1.s(-1). A
   time-dependent drain current measured at 6 K predicts the existence of a
   complex trap state at the Si-SiO2 interface within the bandgap. The
   suppressed drain current and comparable low electron mobility of the
   accumulation layer can be well described by the large Coulomb scattering
   arising from the presence of a large density of interface charged traps.
   The effects of charge trapping and the scattering at interface states
   become the main reasons for mobility reduction for electrons in the
   accumulation region.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal desorption behaviors of zirconium hydride powder under
   non-isothermal and isothermal heat treatment conditions were studied
   using simultaneous TG-TDS. The phase transformation sequences were
   established by correlating the observed peaks of H-2 release and mass
   loss. The origins of the peaks or shoulders in the TDS spectra were
   described as the equilibrium hydrogen pressures of a number of
   consecutive phase regions that decomposition reaction passed through.
   Effect of held temperature on the isothermal desorption behavior was
   taken into consideration, which was shown to be essential for the phase
   transformation sequence during ZrH2 decomposition. The zirconium
   monohydride gamma ZrH was observed at ambient conditions, which has been
   supposed to be metastable for a long time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Influence of age, gender, and race on nitric oxide release over
   acupuncture points-meridians}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This study examined the influence of age, gender and race on nitric
   oxide (NO) release over acupuncture points, meridian without acupoint,
   and non-meridian regions of the Pericardium (PC) and Bladder (BL)
   meridian as well as aging on LU meridian in 61 healthy subjects.
   Biocapture tubes were attached to the skin surface, and total nitrite
   and nitrate was biocaptured and quantified using chemiluminescence. In
   elder ages compared to adults, NO levels over the ventral forearm were
   significantly decreased over LU on radial regions but not altered over
   PC on medial regions. Conversely, NO content was elevated over BL
   regions only in overweight/obesity of elder ages. NO levels over PC
   regions were marginally elevated in overweight/obese males compared to
   females but did not alter between races. These results suggest a
   selective reduction of NO release over LU meridian with aging, which is
   consistent with a progressive decline in lung function and increase in
   chronic respiratory disease in elder ages. Increased NO levels along the
   BL meridian in older obese subjects may reflect a modified NO level
   along somatic-bladder pathway for counteracting bladder dysfunctions
   with aging. Both of them support somatic-organ connections in the
   meridian system associated with potential pathophysiological changes
   with aging.}},

Abstract = {{Simpson's paradox occurs frequently in economic data analysis, wherein
   aggregation is a common practice. Yet, this paradox is not well known
   among researchers in economy. In this article, we present several
   real-world examples of Simpson's paradox in economic statistics,
   including gross domestic product (GDP) growth and per capita GDP growth
   aggregations across developing and developed countries. These
   manifestations of Simpson's paradox highlight some important issues in
   developing economies and have implications on social and economic
   policies. We also present Simpson's paradox for continuous variables,
   and its relationship with ecological correlation using empiric economic
   data. We show that failure to recognize Simpson's paradox and ecological
   correlation can cause inaccurate interpretations of economic data.
   Furthermore, even when one recognizes Simpson's paradox in the data, one
   may still make wrong interpretations, wrong policy decisions, or
   business decisions. We recommend causal analysis to discern the
   confounding variable(s) and to apply sound statistical modeling in the
   face of such a paradox.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of
   hospitalization of children. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most
   common pathogens. The disease severity is diverse, and the diagnosis
   remains a challenge to clinical pediatricians. The aims of this study
   are to provide a nationwide surveillance of the epidemiology and
   clinical manifestations of community-acquired mycoplasma pneumonia
   (CAMP) in children in Taiwan.
   Methods: The medical records of children enrolled by the Taiwan
   Pediatric Infectious Disease Alliance (TPIDA) project during 2010-2011
   were reviewed. Hospitalized children with segmental or lobar pneumonia
   were included. The demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic
   data were analyzed. Nasopharyngeal swabs, pleural effusion, and serum
   were collected for multiplex viral and bacterial polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR), mycoplasma immunoglobulin M (IgM), or paired
   immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer.
   Results: There were overall 127 children with CAMP. Among them, 16
   (12.6\%) children had PCR and IgM positivity, 74 (58.3\%) children had a
   positive serologic study, 34 (27.8\%) children had positive PCR
   detection, and three (2.4\%) children had paired IgG above a four-fold
   increase. Enrolled patients were divided into two groups before and
   after the age of 5 years. Children younger than 5 years or younger had a
   significantly longer hospitalization, higher intensive care unit (ICU)
   admission rates, and more complications. They were more frequent to
   receive oxygen supplementation and even surgical intervention. The white
   blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels were higher in children
   5 years old or younger.
   Conclusion: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important etiology of CAP in
   children 5 years or younger. They had a longer length of
   hospitalization, higher inflammatory responses, and more complications,
   compared to children older than 5 years. Copyright (C) 2014, Taiwan

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence has shown that oxidative stress may be implicated in
   chronic stress-induced depression. Several flavonoids with
   anti-oxidative effects have been proved to be anti-depressive. Myricetin
   is a well-defined flavonoid with the anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory,
   anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective properties. The aim of the present
   study is to investigate the possible effects of chronic administration
   of myricetin on depressant-like behaviors in mice subjected to repeated
   restraint (4 h/day) for 21 days. Our results showed that myricetin
   administration specifically reduced the immobility time in mice exposed
   to chronic stress, as tested in both forced swimming test and tail
   suspension test. Myricetin treatment improved activities of glutathione
   peroxidase (GSH-PX) in the hippocampus of stressed mice. In addition,
   myricetin treatment decreased plasma corticosterone levels of those mice
   subjected to repeated restraint stress. The effects of myricetin on the
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in hippocampus were also
   investigated. The results revealed that myricetin normalized the
   decreased BDNF levels in mice subjected to repeated restraint stress.
   These findings provided more evidence that chronic administration of
   myricetin improves helpless behaviors. The protective effects of
   myricetin might be partially mediated by an influence on BDNF levels and
   might be attributed to myricetin-mediated anti-oxidative stress in the
   hippocampus.}},

   celebrating 50 years of public service. Initially, the AAVMC comprised
   the Council of Deans, the Council of Educators, and the Council of
   Chairs. In 1984, the tri-cameral structure was abandoned and a new
   governing structure with a board of directors was created. In 1997, the
   AAVMC was incorporated in Washington, DC and a common application
   service was created. Matters such as workforce issues and the cost of
   veterinary medical education have persisted for decades. The AAVMC is a
   champion of diversity in the veterinary profession and a strong advocate
   for One Health. The AAVMC has adopted a global perspective as more
   international colleges of veterinary medicine have earned COE

Abstract = {{Understanding how tumor cells transition to an invasive and
   drug-resistant phenotype is central to cancer biology, but the
   mechanisms underlying this transition remain unclear. We show that
   sarcomas gain these malignant traits by inducing lysosomal exocytosis, a
   ubiquitous physiological process. During lysosomal exocytosis, the
   movement of exocytic lysosomes along the cytoskeleton and their docking
   at the plasma membrane involve LAMP1, a sialylated membrane glycoprotein
   and target of the sialidase NEU1. Cleavage of LAMP1 sialic acids by NEU1
   limits the extent of lysosomal exocytosis. We found that by
   down-regulation of NEU1 and accumulation of oversialylated LAMP1, tumor
   cells exacerbate lysosomal exocytosis of soluble hydrolases and
   exosomes. This facilitates matrix invasion and propagation of invasive
   signals, and purging of lysosomotropic chemotherapeutics. In Arf(-/-)
   mice, Neu1 haploinsufficiency fostered the development of invasive,
   pleomorphic sarcomas, expressing epithelial and mesenchymal markers, and
   lysosomal exocytosis effectors, LAMP1 and Myosin-11. These features are
   analogous to those of metastatic, pleomorphic human sarcomas, where low
   NEU1 levels correlate with high expression of lysosomal exocytosis
   markers. In a therapeutic proof of principle, we demonstrate that
   inhibiting lysosomal exocytosis reversed invasiveness and
   chemoresistance in aggressive sarcoma cells. Thus, we reveal that this
   unconventional, lysosome-regulated pathway plays a primary role in tumor
   progression and chemoresistance.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of major Brazilian highways dates back to the 1940's
   and 1950's. During this time, ecological concepts were not considered
   during the construction of highways. Consequently, roads are one of the
   main causes of environmental fragmentation. The goals of this study were
   to assess the diversity of vertebrates that are killed on and near
   highway BR MG 265, to analyze the seasonal variation of these roadkills,
   to compare the rate of road kills on the paved and unpaved sections of
   the road, and to suggest conservation practices. The roads were
   monitored twice a day on seven days during six consecutive months. The
   species, date, and location (for georeferencing) was recorded for each
   road kill. Overall, 48 road kills were found that represented 18
   species, of which 35.42\% were birds, 41.66\% were mammals, 14.53\% were
   reptiles and 8.33\% could not be identified. Tests indicated that
   differences occurred between rainy and dry periods, and that no
   significant differences occurred between the paved and unpaved roads.
   Critical points were identified that require the installation of
   physical speed bumps or automatic radars with signposts that indicate
   wildlife crossings.}},
