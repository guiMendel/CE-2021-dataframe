Abstract = {{For a limited range of parameters, stable Strange quark matter may be
   negatively charged in bulk due to one gluon exchange interactions.
   However, the reduction in strange quark occupation in the surface layer,
   which is responsible for surface tension, more than compensates this for
   intermediate mass strangelets, which therefore always have positive
   quark charge (e.g., for a baryon number between 10(2) and 10(8) assuming
   alpha (s) = 0.9). While details-are sensitive to the choice of
   renormalization, the general conclusion is not. This rules out a
   scenario where negatively charged strangelets produced
   in;ultrarelativistic heavy ion colliders might grow indefinitely with
   potentially disastrous consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Formation of ER-derived protein transport vesicles requires three
   cytosolic components, a small GTPase, Sar1p, and two heterodimeric
   complexes, Sec23/24p and Sec13/31p, which comprise the COPII coat. We
   investigated the role of Lst1p, a Sec24p homologue, in cargo recruitment
   into COPII vesicles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A tagged version of
   Lst1p was purified and eluted as a heterodimer complexed with Sec23p
   comparable to the Sec23/24p heterodimer. We found that cytosol from an
   lst1-null strain supported the packaging of or-factor precursor into
   COPII vesicles but was deficient in the packaging of Pma1p, the
   essential plasma membrane ATPase. Supplementation of mutant cytosol with
   purified Scc23/Lst1p restored Pma1p packaging into the vesicles. When
   purified COPII components were used in the vesicle budding reaction,
   Pma1p packaging was optimal with a mixture of Sec23/24p and Sec23/Lst1p;
   Sec23/Lst1p did not replace Sec23/24p. Furthermore, Pma1p
   coimmunoprecipitated with Lst1p and Sec24p from vesicles, Vesicles
   formed with a mixture of Sec23/Lst1p and Sec23/24p were similar
   morphologically and in their buoyant density, but larger than normal
   COPII vesicles (87-nm vs. 75-nm diameter). Immunoelectronmicroscopic and
   biochemical studies revealed both Sec23/Lst1p and Sec23/24p on the
   membranes of the same vesicles. These results suggest that Lst1p and
   Sec24p cooperate in the packaging of Pma1p and support the view that
   biosynthetic precursors of plasma membrane proteins must be sorted into
   ER-derived transport vesicles. Sec24p homologues may comprise a more
   complex coat whose combinatorial subunit composition serves to expand
   the range of cargo to be packaged into COPII vesicles. By changing the
   geometry of COPII coat polymerization, Lst1p may allow the transport of
   bulky cargo molecules, polymers, or particles.}},

Abstract = {{A model theory of a typed, declarative, temporal object-oriented
   language system is presented. The declarative nature of the language
   makes it very different from the dominating procedural, strongly typed
   object-oriented programming languages. In this declarative system,
   methods are specified in a high-level, temporal constraint language. Two
   fundamental properties of these constraints are that they have an
   execution model and algebraic semantics. The model theory is based on
   temporal order-sorted algebras with predicates. A variety of orderings
   are explored in order to represent various types of inheritance, as well
   as the subtyping discipline. Temporal classes are viewed as temporal
   theories and some inheritance relationships as morphisms of temporal
   theories. A model of a temporal class is a temporal order-sorted
   structure with predicates which satisfies a set of temporal constraints
   specified in that class. Morphisms of those models are naturally
   required to preserve type coercions. A distinguished model of a temporal
   theory is constructed as a colimit of a suitably defined functor. This
   colimit construction reflects the temporal nature of the paradigm and
   generalizes the classical initial algebra semantics. In
   contradistinction to major difficulties in developing a model theory for
   full-fledged, typed procedural object-oriented languages, this paper
   shows that such a task becomes possible for a suitably defined
   declarative object-oriented language. This, in particular, leads to
   model-theoretic results on the preservation of the behavioral properties
   in the inheritance hierarchies. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Background Our study is a repeat of the Dutch death-certificate study on
   end-of-life decisions (ELDs). The main objective was to estimate the
   frequency of euthanasia (the administration of lethal drugs with the
   explicit intention of shortening the patient's life at the patient's
   explicit request), physician-assisted suicide (PAS), and other ELDs in
   medical practice in Flanders, Belgium.
   Methods A 20\% random sample of 3999 deaths was selected from all deaths
   recorded between Jan 1 and April 30, 1998. The physicians who signed the
   corresponding death certificates received one questionnaire by post per
   death.
   Findings The physicians' response rate was 1355 (52\%). 1925 deaths were
   described. The results were corrected for non-response bias, and
   extrapolated to estimated annual rates after seasonal adjustment for
   death causes, and we estimate that 705 (1.3\%, 95\% CI 1.0-1.6) deaths
   resulted from euthanasia or PAS. In 1796 (3.2\%, 2.7-3.8) cases, lethal
   drugs were given without the explicit request of the patient.
   Alleviation of pain and symptoms with opioids in doses with a potential
   life-shortening effect preceded death in 10 416 (18.5\%, 17.3-19.7)
   cases and non-treatment decisions in 9218 (16.4\%, 15.3-17.5) cases, of
   which 3261 (5.8\%, 5.1-6.5) with the explicit intention of ending the
   patient's life.
   Interpretation ELDs are prominent in medical practice in Flanders. The
   frequency of deaths preceded by an ELD is similar to that in the
   Netherlands, but lower than that in Australia. However, in Flanders the
   rate of administration of lethal drugs to patients without their
   explicit request is similar to Australia, and significantly higher than
   that in the Netherlands.}},

   indications of significant roles of several naturally cytotoxic
   lymphocytes in preventing the development of cancer. We began a
   prospective cohort study among a Japanese general population in 1986,
   using various immunological and biochemical markers.
   Methods Natural cytotoxic activity of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells
   was assessed by isotope-release assay in 3625 residents of a Japanese
   population mostly older than 40 years of age, between 1986 and 1990.
   Immunological and biochemical markers were also measured, and
   participants were given a questionnaire on lifestyle. We did an Ii-year
   follow-up survey of the cohort members looking at cancer incidence and
   death from all causes, and analysed the association between cytotoxic
   activity of peripheral-blood lymphocytes assessed at baseline and cancer
   incidence found in the subsequent follow-up.
   Findings 154 cancer cases were used in the analysis. When we categorised
   the cytotoxic activity of peripheral-blood lymphocytes by tertiles,
   age-adjusted relative risk of cancer incidence (all sites) was 0.72
   (95\% CI 0.45-1.16) for men with high cytotoxic activity, and 0.62
   (0.38-1.03) for men with medium cytotoxic activity, taking the risk of
   those with low cytotoxic activity as reference. For women with high
   cytotoxic activity relative risk was 0.52 (0.28-0.95), and for those
   with medium cytotoxic activity 0.56 (0.31-1.01). For both sexes with
   high and medium cytotoxic activity risk was 0.63 (0.43-0.92) and 0.59
   (0.40-0.87), respectively.
   Interpretation Our results indicate that medium and high cytotoxic
   activity of peripheral-blood lymphocytes is associated with reduced
   cancer risk, whereas low activity is associated with increased cancer
   risk suggesting a role for natural immunological host defence mechanisms
   against cancer.}},

Abstract = {{SHIVKU2 replicates to high levels in inoculated macaques and
   reproducibly causes an acute depletion of CD4(+) T cells. We evaluated
   the ability of treatment with the antiretroviral drug
   9-R-(2-phosphonomethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA; tenofovir), begun 7 days
   postinoculation, to inhibit viral replication and associated
   pathogenesis. Highly productive infection (plasma viral RNA > 10(6) copy
   eq/mL) was present and CD4 depletion had started when treatment was
   initiated. PMPA treatment was associated with a rapid decline in plasma
   viral RNA to undetectable levels, with parallel decreases in the
   infectivity of plasma and infectious cells in PBMCs and CSF and
   stabilization of CD4(+)T-cell levels. Viral dynamics parameters were
   calculated for the initial phase of exponential viral replication and
   the treatment-related decline in plasma viremia. Following cessation of
   treatment after 12 weeks, plasma viral RNA was detectable intermittently
   at low levels, and spliced viral transcripts were detected in lymph
   nodes. Although treatment was begun after viral dissemination, high
   viremia, and CD4 decreases had occurred, following withdrawal of PMPA,
   CD4(+) T-cell counts normalized and stabilized in the normal range,
   despite persistent low-level infection. No PMPA-resistance mutations
   were detected. These results validate the similar viral replicative
   dynamics of SHIVKU2 and HIV and SIV, and also underscore the potential
   for long-term modulation of viral replication patterns and clinical
   course by perturbation of primary infection. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Mammalian pro-xenopsins (proXP), proteins (such as alpha -coatomer) that
   yield XP-related peptides when digested by pepsin-related proteases, are
   ubiquitously distributed in rats, with highest concentrations in liver
   and gastrointestinal tissues. Here, the cellular and subcellular
   distributions of canine and rat. proXP were determined in brain, liver,
   stomach and intestine. Elutriation and percoll density centrifugation of
   collagenase-dispersed cells demonstrated that proXP was primarily
   associated with hepatocytes in liver, chief and parietal cells in
   stomach and endocrine/exocrine cells in intestine. When fragmented cells
   were subjected to differential centrifugation, congruent to 85\% of
   proXP was associated with particulate fractions and only congruent to
   15\% was cytosolic. Sucrose-gradient centrifugation of crude
   mitochondrial preparations (P-2 pellets) for liver, stomach and
   intestine demonstrated that proXP was localized to vesicles (density,
   congruent to 1.19; size, 80-400 mum), which contained material of
   variable electron density. In isotonic homogenates of brain, proXP
   migrated primarily with synaptosomes (density, congruent to1.15) which
   contained vesicles (size, 50-100 mum) During HPLC-sizing and ion
   exchange chromatography, proXP gave at least three components, the major
   one being an anionic 140-kDa protein. ProXP-like activity was found in
   human and rat blood, human cerebral spinal fluid and in contents of the
   gastrointestinal lumen. These results an consistent with the idea that
   these vesicle-associated protein(s) could be released during endocrine
   and/or exocrine secretion and serve as precursors to XP-related
   peptides. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The vertebrate retina retains a circadian oscillator, and its
   oscillation is self-sustained with a period close to 24 h under constant
   environmental conditions. Here we show that bullfrog retinal
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) exhibits an in vivo circadian
   rhythm in phosphorylation with a peak at night in a light/dark cycle.
   The phosphorylation rhythm of MAPK persists in constant darkness with a
   peak at subjective night, and this self-sustained rhythm is also
   observed in cultured retinas, indicating its close interaction with the
   retinal oscillator. The rhythmically phosphorylated MAPK. is detected
   only in a discrete subset of amacrine cells despite ubiquitous
   distribution of MAPK throughout the retinal layers. Treatment of the
   cultured retinas with MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 suppresses
   MAPK phosphorylation during the subjective night, and this pulse
   perturbation of MEK activity induces a significant phase delay (4-8 h)
   of the retinal circadian rhythm in MAPK and MEK phosphorylation. These
   observations strongly suggest that the site-specific and
   time-of-day-specific activation of MAPK contributes to the circadian
   time-keeping mechanism of the retinal clock system.}},

Abstract = {{The serine protease thrombin proteolytically activates blood coagulation
   factor XIII by cleavage at residue Arg(37); factor XIII in turn
   cross-links fibrin molecules and gives mechanical stability to the blood
   clot. The 2.0-Angstrom resolution x-ray crystal structure of human
   cy-thrombin bound to the factor XII-(28-37) decapeptide has been
   determined. This structure reveals the detailed atomic level
   interactions between the factor XIII activation peptide and thrombin and
   provides the first high resolution view of this functionally important
   part of the factor XIII molecule. A comparison of this structure with
   the crystal structure of fibrinopeptide A complexed with thrombin
   highlights several important determinants of thrombin substrate
   interaction. First, the P1 and P2 residues must be compatible with the
   geometry and chemistry of the SI and S2 specificity sites in thrombin.
   Second, a glycine in the P5 position is necessary for the conserved
   substrate conformation seen in both factor XIII-(28-37) and
   fibrinopeptide A. Finally, the hydrophobic residues, which occupy the
   aryl binding site of thrombin determine the substrate conformation
   further away from the catalytic residues. In the case of factor
   XII-(28-37), the aryl binding site is shared by hydrophobic residues P4
   (Val(34)) and P9 (Val(29)). A bulkier residue in either of these sites
   may alter the substrate peptide conformation.}},

   engineered individual biomolecular motors and nanoscale inorganic
   systems, and we describe their integration in a hybrid nanomechanical
   device powered by a biomolecular motor. The device consisted of three

   injection of the voltage-sensitive Ca2+-channel (Ca-VS(2+)-channel)
   blocker, nifedipine (500 nmol/kg, i.v.). Before injection of nifedipine,
   the agents produced similar falls in mean arterial blood pressure, and
   in hindquarter and mesenteric vascular resistances. The depressor and
   vasodilator responses elicited by sodium nitroprusside and MAHMA NONOate
   were markedly attenuated by nifedipine. The falls in mean arterial blood
   pressure and mesenteric resistance elicited by L-S-nitrosocysteine and
   acetylcholine were not attenuated but the falls in hindquarter
   resistance were slightly attenuated by nifedipine. The cyclooxygenase
   inhibitor, indomethacin (10 mg/kg, i.v.), did not affect the actions of
   sodium nitroprusside, MAHMA NONOate, L-S-nitrosocysteine or
   acetylcholine or the effects of nifedipine on the hemodynamic actions of
   these compounds. The decomposition of sodium nitroprusside (0.2

   nmol/ml) to NO upon addition to rat blood was not affected by nifedipine

   resistance arteries in vivo by inhibition of Ca-VS(2+)-channels whereas
   L-S-nitrosocysteine and the non-prostanoid endothelium-derived relaxing

Abstract = {{The antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone down-regulates the density of cardiac
   beta -adrenoceptors behaving as a triiodothyronine (T-3) antagonist. It
   is still unclear if amiodarone acts at the nuclear (genomic) and/or the
   non-genomic levels. Using Northern blot analysis, we showed that the
   amiodarone had no effect on the increase of beta (1)-adrenoceptor mRNA
   level induced by the T-3-administration in the heart of thyroidectomised
   rats. Thus, our results suggest that amiodarone has no genomic effect.
   Consequently, we investigated whether amiodarone down-regulation of beta
   -adrenoceptor number in T-3-stimulated cardiomyocytes could be explained
   by changes in the rate of cell surface receptor protein turnover.
   Indeed, the binding studies of cyclohexidemide-treated cells showed that
   amiodarone suppressed the T-3-induced decrease in the rate of the cell
   surface receptor disappearance. In conclusion, our findings indicate
   that the modulation of cardiac beta -adrenoceptor density by amiodarone
   involves only non-genomic targets required in T-3-dependent regulation
   of the cell surface beta -adrenoceptor turnover. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Delta (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), a bifunctional ATP-
   and NADPH-dependent mitochondrial enzyme, catalyzes the reduction of
   glutamate to Delta (1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, a critical step in the
   biosynthesis of proline, ornithine and arginine, Recently, we reported
   the cloning and expression of human and murine P5CS cDNAs, Previously,
   we showed that mammalian P5CS undergoes alternative splicing to generate
   two isoforms differing only by a 2 amino acid insert at the N-terminus
   of the gamma -glutamyl kinase active site, The short isoform has high
   activity In the gut, where it participates in arginine biosynthesis and
   is inhibited by ornithine, The long isoform, expressed in multiple
   tissues, is necessary for the synthesis of proline from glutamate and is
   insensitive to ornithine, Here, we describe a newly recognized inborn
   error due to the deficiency of P5CS in two siblings with progressive
   neurodegeneration, joint laxity, skin hyperelasticity and bilateral
   subcapsular cataracts, Their metabolic phenotype includes
   hyperammonemia, hypoornithinemia, hypocitrullinemia, hypoargininemia and
   hypoprolinemia. Both are homozygous for the missense mutation, R84Q,
   which alters a conserved residue in the! P5CS gamma -glutamyl kinase
   domain, R84Q is not present in 194 control chromosomes and dramatically
   reduces the activity of both P5CS isoforms when expressed in mammalian
   cells, Additionally, R84Q appears to destabilize the long isoform, This;
   is the first documented report of an inborn error of P5CS and suggests
   that this disorder should be considered in the differential diagnosis in
   patients with neurodegeneration and/or cataracts and connective tissue
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{The coordination geometry of zeolite-encapsulated copper(II)-histidine
   (CuHis) complexes, prepared by ion exchange of the complexes from
   aqueous solutions into zeolite NaY, was determined by a combination of
   UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-band EPR,
   electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM), and high field (W-band)
   pulsed ENDOR techniques. X-band EPR spectroscopy detected two distinct
   complexes, A and B, which are different from the prevailing Cu(II)
   bis-His complex in the exchange solution (PH 7.3 with a His:Cu(II) ratio
   of 5.1). Moreover, the relative amount of complex B was found to
   increase with increasing Cu(II) concentration. The EPR parameters of
   complex A are g(perpendicular to) = 2.054, g(parallel to) = 2.31, and
   A(parallel to) = 15.8 mT, whereas those of complex B are g(perpendicular
   to) = 2.068, g(parallel to) =2.25, A(parallel to) = 18.3 mT, and
   A(perpendicular to)(N-14) similar to 1.3 mT. The presence of the N-14
   superhyperfine splitting shows that in complex B three nitrogens are
   coordinated to the Cu(II). Furthermore, DRS exhibits a shift of the d-d
   absorption band of Cu(II) from 15 200 cm(-1) in complex A to 15 900
   cm(-1) in complex B, indicating an increasing ligand field strength in
   the latter. The coordination of the imino nitrogen of the imidazole
   group was detected in the two complexes via the ESEEM frequencies Of the
   remote nitrogen. In contrast, only complex A exhibited Al-27 modulation,
   which indicates that the Cu(II) binds to zeolite framework oxygens. H-2
   and H-1 W-band ENDOR measurements on samples where the exchangeable
   protons were replaced with H-2, and using specifically labeled histidine
   (His-alpha -d-beta -d(2)), lead to the unambiguous determination of the
   coordination configuration of the two complexes. Complex A is a mono-His
   complex when both the amino and imino nitrogens are coordinated and the
   other equatorial ligands are provided by a zeolite oxygen and a water
   molecule. Complex B is a bis-His complex, which is situated in the
   center of the supercage, and all equatorial coordination sites are
   provided by the His molecules. These are amino and imino nitrogens of
   one His molecule and the imino nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen of the
   second His molecule. Complex A can be converted into complex B by
   stirring the zeolite in a high pH solution, whereas complex B is
   converted into complex A by using a low pH solution, thus indicating
   that complex A is stabilized by the presence of intrazeolitic protons.
   On the basis of the structure of the complexes, the dependence of their
   relative amounts on the pH and Cu(II) concentration in the exchange
   solution, the His: Cu(II) ratio in the zeolite, the amount of exchanged
   Na(I) ions, and the steric constraints imposed by the zeolite framework,
   a model for the ion exchange processes and the intrazeolite reactions
   leading to the formation of the two complexes is presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper illustrates that the make or buy is a strategic decision and
   has implications for the overall corporate strategy of the organisation
   by describing a model which involves analysing a number of strategic
   factors. In recent years, many companies have been moving significantly
   away from ``making{''} towards ``buying{''}. However, research has
   revealed that make or buy decisions are rarely taken within a thoroughly
   strategic perspective. It has been shown that many firms adopt a
   shea-term perspective and are motivated primarily by the search for
   short-term cost reductions. It is argued that make or buy decisions are
   made most frequently by default with little consideration for the
   long-run competitiveness of the organisation. An outline of three key
   problems encountered by companies in their efforts to formulate an
   effective make or buy decision is presented, in order to illustrate the
   weaknesses in current make or buy practice. The make or buy model
   described in this paper attempts to overcome these problems by offering
   an organisation a conceptual framework to follow in the sourcing
   decision. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The local structure of three hydrogen bonded liquids comprising clusters
   of markedly different topology: water, methanol, and HF are investigated
   by analyzing the properties of the Voronoi polyhedra (VP) of the
   molecules in configurations obtained from Monte Carlo computer
   simulations. For comparisons, the properties of argon as a
   nonassociating reference liquid are also calculated. It is found that in
   liquid HF the fluctuation of the local density is much larger than in
   the other three liquids, and hence, besides the dense regions, this
   liquid contains numerous large voids as well. The size of the largest of
   these voids is found to be commensurate with a cluster of 11 HF
   molecules, whereas the number of voids as large as one molecule is in
   the order of the number of molecules. It is found that the number of the
   hydrogen-bonded neighbors of the HF molecules located at the boundary of
   such voids does not differ considerably from that of the other
   molecules, and thus they do not have any specific topological position
   (e.g., chain terminal) in the hydrogen bonded chains of the molecules.
   The shape of the VP is found to reflect the arrangement of the nearest
   neighbors of the molecules. Thus, the VP are considerably less spherical
   and their topological properties are distributed in a wider range in the
   associated liquids than in argon. Similarly, in the hydrogen bonded
   liquids considerably more geometric neighbors are found than the number
   of molecules belonging to the first coordination shell. On the other
   hand, in liquid argon, which is a closely packed system, the two values
   are found to be close to each other. The inhomogeneities of the local
   density of liquid HF are also reflected in the shape of the VP. The
   molecules located at the boundary of the large voids are found to have
   more spherical VP with more and larger faces than the other ones. (C)

Abstract = {{Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data have been collected on five
   different crystals at 12 different temperatures (10, 28, 35, 60, 85,
   100, 118, 135, 160, 200, 240, 295 K) on a trinuclear, ore-bridged,
   mixed-valence iron complex, Fe3O(O2CC(CH3)(3))(6)(C5H5N)(3), using both
   synchrotron and conventional radiation sources. The present study for
   the first time provides structural information for an ore-bridged
   trinuclear compound below the boiling point of nitrogen (77 K). The use
   of very low-temperature crystallographic data is crucial for
   understanding the physical properties of the complex. No change of space
   group is observed in the whole temperature range, although a reversible
   broadening of the Bragg peaks is observed around 85 K. The structure has
   ordering processes involving the tert-butyl groups, and above 85 K, four
   tert-butyl groups become disordered. Around 150 K, a fifth tert-butyl
   becomes disordered, whereas the last tert-butyl is ordered at all
   temperatures. Very significant temperature-dependent changes in the
   Fe-ligand bond lengths an observed which are interpreted as being due to
   dynamic disorder caused by intramolecular electron transfer (ET) between
   the metal sites. The ET process is significantly affected by changes in
   the molecular potential energy surface (PES) caused by the dynamic
   behavior of the tert-butyls. The dynamic disorder of the Fe3O core
   resulting from the ET process is examined through analysis of the atomic
   displacement parameters. The ET process involves only two of the three
   iron sites, with the third site appearing to be valence-trapped at all
   temperatures. The trapping of this iron site at all temperatures appears
   to be related to the asymmetry caused by the different dynamic behaviors
   of the tert-butyls. At very low temperatures (<10 K), the system becomes
   valence-trapped and consists of a single configuration without disorder.
   Boltzmann population models are used to estimate the energy difference
   between the two lowest-lying minima on the PES (<Delta>E < 100 cm(-1))
   and between two disordered configurations of each of the tert-butyls
   (<Delta>E = 217, 212, 255, 359, and 345 cm(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{Background-Human monocyte-derived macrophages synthesize numerous
   proinflammatory and prothrombotic substances, including lipid mediators,
   such as platelet-activating factor (PAF), which may play a major role in
   the onset and perpetuation of atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, both
   monocytes and macrophages express PAF receptors (PAF-R). The expression
   of PAF-R is transcriptionally downregulated by oxidized LDL in in vitro
   primary cultures of monocyte/macrophages. In this study, we evaluated
   the expression of PAF-R in human carotid plaque tissue, in foam cells
   isolated from human carotid plaques, and in primary cultures of
   umbilical smooth muscle cells (SMCs).
   Methods and Results-We show that PAF-R was expressed at low levels in
   foam cells compared with monocyte/macrophages in plaques, as assessed by
   immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization. In addition, low
   levels of mRNA were also detected by RT-PCR in isolated human carotid
   foam cells. A prominent finding of our study was the demonstration that
   contractile SMCs were positive for PAF-R, and its mRNA was extracted
   from primary cultures of umbilical SMCs.
   Conclusions-As macrophages loose their inflammatory phenotype on
   transformation into foam cells, they may equally loose their capacity of
   defense against aggression. We postulate that the diminished expression
   of PAF-R may be deleterious in the context of plaque formation and
   progression. The observation that arterial SMCs of contractile phenotype
   express PAF-R opens new avenues concerning the migration of these cells
   from media to intima and atherosclerotic plaque formation.}},

Abstract = {{Optical activity and birefringence in the presence of multiple
   reflections for (100), (010) and (101) planes of quartz were studied by
   using a high-accuracy universal polarimeter (HAUP) in a temperature
   range between 20 and 300 degreesC. Likewise, optical activity in the
   presence of multiple reflections for the (001) plane of quartz was
   studied by using a conventional polarimeter in the same temperature
   range at 632.8 nm wavelength. In all cases a modulation of the HAUP
   parameters determined by linear least-square fit is observed when the
   temperature is changed. This effect can be explained by the multiple
   reflections within the slab of a high degree of plane parallelism. The
   Levenberg-Marquardt method of nonlinear least-square routines was used
   to compare the experimental values of the HAUP coefficients with the
   results obtained using the Jones formalism. The method gives directly
   the optimum temperature dependence of birefringence and gyration tensor
   components of quartz.}},

Abstract = {{Plants are continuously subjected to UV-B radiation (UV-B; 280-320 nm)
   as a component of sunlight causing damage to the genome. For elimination
   of DNA damage, a set of repair mechanisms, mainly photoreactivation,
   excision, and recombination repair, has evolved. Whereas
   photoreactivation and excision repair have been intensely studied during
   the last few years, recombination repair, its regulation, and its
   interrelationship with photoreactivation in response to UV-B-induced DNA
   damage is still poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed somatic
   homologous recombination in a transgenic Arabidopsis line carrying a
   beta -glucuronidase gene as a recombination marker and in offsprings of
   crosses of this line with a photolyase deficient uvr2-1 mutant. UV-B
   radiation stimulated recombination frequencies in a dose-dependent
   manner correlating linearly with cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD)
   levels. Genetic deficiency for CPD-specific photoreactivation resulted
   in a drastic increase of recombination events, indicating that
   homologous recombination might be directly involved in eliminating CPD
   damage. UV-B irradiation stimulated recombination mainly in the presence
   of photosynthetic active radiation (400-700 nm) irrespective of
   photolyase activities. Our results suggest that UV-B-induced
   recombination processes may depend on energy supply derived from
   photosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) has been reported to inhibit
   steady-state proton translocation by cytochrome bc(1) and b(6)f
   complexes without significantly altering the rate of electron transport,
   a process referred to as decoupling. In chromatophores of the purple
   bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, this has been associated with the
   specific labeling of a surface-exposed aspartate-187 of the cytochrome b
   subunit of the bc(1) complex {[}Wang et al. (1998) Arch. Biochem.
   Biophyss. 352, 193-198]. To explore the possible role of this amino acid
   residue in the protonogenic reactions of cytochrome bc(1) complex, we
   investigated the effect of DCCD modification on flash-induced electron
   transport and the electrochromic bandshift of carotenoids in Rb.
   sphaeroides chromatophores from wild type (WT) and mutant cells, in
   which aspartate-187 of cytochrome b (Asp(B187)) has been changed to
   asparagine (mutant B187 DN). The kinetics and amplitude of phase III of
   the electrochromic shift of carotenoids, reflecting electrogenic
   reactions in the bc(1) complex, and of the redox changes of cytochromes
   and reaction center, were similar (+/- 15\%) in both WT and B187DN
   chromatophores. DCCD effectively inhibited phase III of the carotenoid
   bandshift in both B187DN and WT chromatophores, The dependence of the
   kinetics and amplitude of phase LII of the electrochromic shift on DCCD
   concentration was identical in WT and B187DN chromatophores, indicating
   that covalent modification of Asp(B187) is not specifically responsible
   for the effect of DCCD-induced effects of cytochrome bc(1) complex.
   Furthermore, no evidence for differential inhibition of electrogenesis
   and electron transport was found in either strain. We conclude that
   Asp(B187) plays no crucial role in the protonogenic reactions of bc(1)
   complex, since its replacement by asparagine does not lead to any
   significant effects on either the electrogenic reactions of bc(1)
   complex, as revealed by phase III of the electrochromic shift of
   carotenoids, or sensitivity of turnover to DCCD.}},

Abstract = {{Cell division and differentiation continue throughout the plant life
   cycle without significant loss of control. However, little is known
   about the mechanisms that allow the continuous development of meristems.
   Cell division is controlled by a family of cyclin-dependent kinases
   (CDKs). CDK-activating kinases (CAKs) are known to phosphorylate and
   activate almost all CDKs and thus may have a crucial role in controlling
   CDK activities in each cell of the meristems. Here, we show that
   overexpression of sense or antisense gene for Cak1At in Arabidopsis by
   using the glucocorticoid-mediated transcriptional induction system
   resulted in a reduction of CDK activities. After 14-24 h of
   glucocorticoid treatment, starch granules appeared in columellar
   initials in the root meristem, and cortical initials were periclinally
   divided into cortical and endodermal cells. Accumulation of the
   cyclin::beta -glucuronidase fusion protein ceased after 72 h of
   glucocorticoid treatment. Our results indicate that a change of Cak1At
   activity leads to differentiation of initial cells, followed by
   cessation of cell division. Therefore, we propose that differentiation
   of initial cells is controlled by Cak1At but is maintained independent
   of cell division.}},

Abstract = {{We previously generated a transgenic mouse model for acute promyelocytic
   leukemia (APL) by expressing the promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic
   acid receptor (RAR alpha) cDNA in early myeloid cells. This fusion
   protein causes a myeloproliferative disease in 100\% of animals, but
   only 15-20\% of the animals develop acute leukemia after a long latency
   period (6-13 months). PML-RAR alpha is therefore necessary, but not
   sufficient, for APL development. The coexpression of a reciprocal form
   of the fusion, RAR alpha -PML, increased the likelihood of APL
   development (55-60\%), but did not shorten latency. Together, these
   results suggested that additional genetic events are required for the
   development of APL. We therefore evaluated the splenic tumor cells from
   18 transgenic mice with APL for evidence of secondary genetic events, by
   using spectral karyotyping analysis. Interstitial or terminal deletions
   of the distal region of one copy of chromosome 2 {[}del(2)] were found
   in 1/5 tumors expressing PML-RAR alpha, but in 11/13 tumors expressing
   both PML-RAR alpha and RAR alpha -PML (P < 0.05). Leukemic cells that
   contained a deletion on chromosome 2 often contained additional
   chromosomal gains (especially of 15), chromosomal losses (especially of
   11 or X/Y), or were tetraploid (P <less than or equal to> 0.001). These
   changes did not commonly occur in nontransgenic littermates, nor in aged
   transgenic mice that did not develop APL. These results suggest that
   expression of RAR alpha -PML increases the likelihood of chromosome 2
   deletions in APL cells. Deletion 2 appears to predispose APL cells to
   further chromosomal instability, which may lead to the acquisition of
   additional changes that provide an advantage to the transformed cells.}},

   metabolism of a single 100-mg dose of imipramine before and after

   were phenotyped for CYP2D6 activity. Two subjects were poor metabolizers
   of dextromethophan, and data from the remaining six subjects (mean age =
   45.3 +/- 15) were analyzed. Venlafaxine increased imipramine C-max and
   elevated AUC by 40\%. Desipramine clearance and volume of distribution
   were reduced by 20\% and 25\%, respectively. These findings are

Abstract = {{Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in ambient air are
   considered as potential human carcinogens, but the detailed mechanism of
   action is still unknown. Our aim was to study the in vitro effect of
   exposure to dibenzo{[}a,1]pyrene (DB{[}a,1]P), the most potent
   carcinogenic PAH ever tested, and benzo{[}a]pyrene (B{[}a]P) in a normal
   human diploid lung fibroblast cells (HEL) using multiple endpoints. DNA
   adduct levels were measured by P-32-postlabelling, the expression of p53
   and p21(WAF1) proteins by western blotting and the cell cycle
   distribution by flow cytometry. For both PAHs, the DNA adduct formation
   was proportional to the time of exposure and dependent on the stage of
   cell growth in culture. DNA binding was detectable even at the lowest
   concentration used (24 h exposure, 0.01 muM for both PAHs). The highest
   DNA adduct levels were observed after 24 h of exposure in near-confluent
   cells (>90\% of cells at GO/G1 phase), but DNA damage induced by
   DB{[}a,l]P was similar to 8-10 times higher at a concentration one order
   of magnitude lower as compared with B{[}a]P (for B{[}a]P at 1 muM and
   for DB{[}a,1]P at 0.1 muM: 237 +/- 107 and 2360 +/- 798 adducts/10(8)
   nucleotides, respectively). The induction of p53 and p21(WAF1) protein
   occurred subsequent to the induction of DNA adducts. The DNA adduct
   levels correlated with both p53 (R = 0.832, P < 0.001 and R = 0.859, P <
   0.001, for DB{[}a,1]P and B{[}a]P, respectively) and p21(WAF1) levels (R
   = 0.808, P < 0.001 and R = 0.797, P = 0.001, for DB{[}a,1]P and B{[}a]P,
   respectively), regardless of the PAH exposure and the phase of cell
   growth. The results showed that a detectable increase of p53 and
   p21(WAF1) proteins (<greater than or equal to>1.5-fold as compared with
   controls) requires a minimal DNA adduct level of similar to 200-250
   adducts/10(8) nucleotides for both PAHs tested and suggest that the
   level of adducts rather than their structure triggers the p53 and
   p21(WAF1) responses. The cell cycle was altered after 12-16 h of
   treatment, and after 24 h of exposure to 0.1 muM DB{[}a,1]P in growing
   cells, there was similar to 24\% increase in S phase cells accompanied
   by a decrease in G1 and G2/mitosis (G2/M) cells. Cell treatment with 1.0
   muM B{[}a]P resulted in more subtle alterations. We conclude that
   DB{[}a,1]P, and to a lesser degree B{[}a]P, are able to induce DNA

Abstract = {{Examining the nature of the relative clustering of different galaxy
   types can help tell us how galaxies formed. To measure this relative
   clustering, I perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis of galaxies of
   different spectral types in the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS). I
   develop a maximum-likelihood technique to fit for the relationship
   between the density fields of early- and late-type galaxies. This
   technique can directly measure nonlinearity and stochasticity in the
   biasing relation. At high significance, a small amount of stochasticity
   is measured, corresponding to a correlation coefficient r approximate to
   0.87 on scales corresponding to 15 h(-1) Mpc spheres. A large proportion
   of this signal appears to derive from errors in the selection function,
   and a more realistic estimate finds r approximate to 0.95. These
   selection function errors probably account for the large stochasticity
   measured by Tegmark \& Bromley, and may have affected measurements of
   very large-scale structure in the LCRS. Analysis of the data and of mock
   catalogs shows that the peculiar geometry, variable flux limits, and
   central surface brightness selection effects of the LCRS do not seem to
   cause the effect.}},

Abstract = {{We report results from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/near-infrared
   camera and multiobject spectrometer (NICMOS) 2 mum imaging polarimetry
   of the central region of Centaurus A. In the vicinity of the nucleus we
   observe a complex polarization structure, which we explain by a
   combination of scattering of nuclear light and dichroic polarization
   associated with the dust lane. The scattered nuclear radiation is found
   in an angular region that extends over greater than or similar to 70
   degrees, and thus it does not originate from a highly collimated beam
   but is associated with more omnidirectional nuclear illumination. These
   observations also show the presence of an unresolved, highly polarized
   (P = 11.1\%) nuclear source whose polarization angle theta = 148
   degrees2 is perpendicular to the jet axis. We set an upper limit of 0 ``
   04 (similar to0.8 pc) to its extent. The observed nuclear polarization
   is naturally accounted for if we are observing scattered light from an
   otherwise obscured nucleus provided that both the scattering region and
   the occulting torus are extremely compact, with an outer radius of less
   than similar to1 pc. Alternatively, we might be directly seeing the
   infrared counterpart of the radio core, similar to those found in other
   low-luminosity radio galaxies observed with HST. We discuss these
   results in the framework of the FR I/BL Lac unifying model.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented in which estimates of evaporation may be made over
   an area approaching three quarters of a square kilometer, with
   relatively fine (25 m) spatial resolution, using three-dimensional
   measurements of water vapor concentration from a scanning Raman lidar.
   The method is based upon Monin-Obukhov similarity theory applied to
   spatially and temporally averaged data, Data from the lidar is used to
   sense the location and orientation of the surface and the location of
   the water vapor measurements with respect to that surface. Maps of the
   spatial distribution of evaporation have been produced showing the
   evaporation rates at regular intervals throughout the day. The method
   was applied to the SALSA experimental site during the 1997 summer field
   campaign. The estimates of evaporation rates made during the campaign
   compare favorably with estimates made using sap flux methods with RMS
   differences of 18W/m(2). While the method has certain limitations, the
   three-dimensional character of the data allows for the detection of
   anomalous situations so that analysts may alter the analysis technique
   or reject the estimates from the affected regions. This information can
   be used in a wide variety of ways to study the spatial variations in
   evaporation caused by changes in soil type and moisture content, canopy
   type and topography. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{From a coupling model between the Boltzmann transport equation and the
   quantum Liouville equation, we have developed a simulator based on the
   Wigner distribution function (WDF) approach that can be applied to
   resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) and other vertical transport quantum
   devices. In comparison to previous WDF simulators, the tool allows one
   to extend the simulation domains up to hundreds of nanometers, which are
   the typical dimensions required for the study of actual multilayer
   structures. With these improvements, a level of agreement between theory
   and experiment comparable to that obtained by using other simulators
   based on Green functions has been achieved. The results of this work
   reveal that the WDF formalism can be alternatively used to study the
   behavior of actual multilayered RTDs. (C) 2000 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Loss of surface expression of class I major histocompatibility antigens
   is commonly observed in malignant tumors and has been considered one of
   the mechanisms for escape from cytotoxic T cells. However, natural
   killer cells kill cells lacking HLA class I antigens, In the present
   study, we characterized by immunohistochemistry the HLA class I
   expression of breast carcinomas from 187 patients with TNM stages I and
   II, diagnosed 1981-1984, using beta (2)-microglobulin as a marker and
   evaluated the effect on survival with a follow-up of up to 14 years. The
   largest group (48\%) consisted of HLA class I-negative tumors (less than
   or equal to 10\% of cells stained), mixed expression (> 10\% and < 80\%
   of cells stained) was seen in 36\% and only 15\% were classified as HLA
   class I-positive (greater than or equal to 80\% cells stained). No
   associations could be established with various clinicopathological
   parameters, such as tumor size, presence of lymph node metastases,
   histological grade, expression of hormone receptors, S phase and p53
   mutations. There was no effect on recurrence-free survival in the whole
   group; but among node-negative patients (n = 86), those who had tumors
   with mixed HLA class I expression had a significantly higher probability
   of disease recurrence (OR = 3.42, p 0.014) than patients with either HLA
   class I-positive or -negative tumors, particularly after more than 5
   years. In node-positive patients who received adjuvant therapy, this

Abstract = {{In this paper the polarized optical spectra (absorption and
   fluorescence) of the Nd3+ ion in the Gd-2(MoO4)(3) non-linear crystal
   have been investigated at low (10 K) and room temperature. Results
   obtained from low-temperature experiments have been used to obtain the
   energy level diagram and also to identify two non-equivalent centres of
   Nd3+ ions in this crystal. The Judd-Ofelt formalism is applied to the
   room temperature absorption spectra. and the relevant spectroscopic
   parameters (quantum efficiency and emission cross section) for laser
   applications have been estimated. Infrared-to-visible up-conversion in
   this host crystal is reported for the first time. Finally,
   continuous-wave laser experiments are carried out and from them, optimal
   conditions for generation of green laser light are established.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated tool that consists of a volume scanning high-resolution
   Raman water vapor LIDAR and a turbulence-resolving hydrodynamic model,
   called HIGRAD, is used to support the semi-arid land-surface-atmosphere
   (SALSA) program. The water vapor measurements collected during SALSA
   have been simulated by the HIGRAD code with a resolution comparable with
   that of the LIDAR data. The LIDAR provides the required ``ground
   truth{''} of coherent water vapor eddies and the model allows for
   interpretation of the underlying physics of such measurements and
   characterizes the relationships between surface conditions, boundary
   layer dynamics, and measured quantities. The model results compare well
   with the measurements, including the overall structure and evolution of
   water vapor plumes, the contrast of plume variabilities over the
   cottonwoods and the grass land, and the mid-day suppression of turbulent
   activities over the canopy. The current study demonstrates an example
   that such an integration between modeling and LIDAR measurements can
   advance our understanding of the structure of fine-scale turbulent
   motions that govern evaporative exchange above a heterogeneous surface.

   so-called polyhedral approach and that based on the pressure dependence
   of particular Raman-active modes. In order to investigate the
   reliability of the results obtained for Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3, the two
   approaches have also been applied to perovskite-type titanates, ATiO(3)
   (A = Ca, Ba, Sr, Pb), and the results are compared with compressibility
   data reported in the literature. The comparative study shows that (i)
   ATiO(3) compressibilities are overestimated by the polyhedral approach,
   bur can be roughly corrected by an empirical scaling factor, (ii) the A
   cation has a smaller influence in the compressibility than would be
   expected in view of the weakly bonded large AO(12) polyhedra, (iii) TiO6
   compressibilities deduced from Raman spectra are remarkably uniform
   among different titanates ((4.3 +/- 0.2) x 10(-3) GPa(-1)), (iv) the
   Raman approach yields compressibilities within 10\% of the experimental

Abstract = {{A liquid-solid fluidized bed reactor was used to carry out sulfate
   reduction with a mixed cu Itu re of su if ate reducing bacteria. The
   bacteria were immobilized on po rous glass beads. Stable fluidized bed
   operation with these biofilm-coated beads was possible. The low specific
   gravity of the hydrated beads allowed operation at low liquid
   recirculation rates. H2S level in the reactor was controlled by N-2
   sparging, which also served as the location for liquid feed and removal.
   Ethanol was used as the electron donor/carbon source for the bacteria.
   Sulfate reduction rates up to 6.33 g sulfate L-1 day(-1) were attained
   in the reactor at a hydraulic retention time of 5.1 h. The effect of
   hydraulic retention time and biomass loading on the beads, on reactor
   performance, and efficiency were examined. The efficiency of sulfate
   reduction increases considerably as the hydraulic retention increases,
   until the bacteria became very strongly substrate-limited at 55h HRT.
   The effect of bead biomass loading on bed expansion at various liquid
   superficial velocities was studied. A model for the reactor was
   developed. Simulations of the continuous flow experiments indicate that
   the model can describe the system well, and thus could be used in the
   design/scale-up of such reactors. The model suggests that a significant
   increase in the sulfate reduction capacity of the system is possible by
   increasing the volume of the bed relative to the total liquid volume of
   the system. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A formalism for the error treatment of lidar ozone measurements with the
   Raman differential absorption lidar technique is presented. In the
   presence of clouds wavelength-dependent multiple scattering and
   cloud-particle extinction are the main sources of systematic errors in
   ozone measurements and necessitate a correction of the measured ozone
   profiles. Model calculations are performed to describe the influence of
   cirrus and polar stratospheric clouds on the ozone. It is found that it
   is sufficient to account for cloud-particle scattering and Rayleigh
   scattering in and above the cloud; boundary-layer aerosols and the
   atmospheric column below the cloud can be neglected for the ozone
   correction. Furthermore, if the extinction coefficient of the cloud is
   greater than or similar to0.1 km(-1), the effect in the cloud is
   proportional to the effective particle extinction and to a particle
   correction function determined in the limit of negligible molecular
   scattering. The particle correction function depends on the scattering
   behavior of the cloud particles, the cloud geometric structure, and the
   lidar system parameters. Because of the differential extinction of Light
   that has undergone one or more small-angle scattering processes within
   the cloud, the cloud effect on ozone extends to altitudes above the
   cloud. The various influencing parameters imply that the
   particle-related ozone correction has to be calculated for each
   individual measurement. Examples of ozone measurements in cirrus clouds
   are discussed. (C) 2000 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 010.3640,

   mm; similar to 20 mg) to determine the elasticity and fracture behavior

   range of porosities were tested using a thermomechanical analyzer and
   values for the Young's modulus and critical stress intensity factor at
   zero porosity (E-0 and K-IC0) were determined by extrapolation. The
   value of E-0 measured at ambient relative humidity on un-notched beams
   was found to be in close agreement with that reported for much larger
   samples, and the Value of K-IC0 for the small notched compacts was at
   the lower limit of the accepted range of values for microcrystalline
   cellulose. The fracture toughness (R) and total energy of fracture (U)
   for the notched specimens were also determined and used to estimate the

Abstract = {{In mammals, visual experience during early postnatal life is critical
   for normal development of the visual system. Here we report that
   monocular deprivation for 2, 7, and 14 consecutive days causes p53
   accumulation, cell death, and progressive loss of neurones in the dorsal
   lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of newborn rats and these are
   prevented by NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists, and by
   L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis. Monocular deprivation
   also increases dLGN levels of citrulline, the coproduct of nitric oxide
   synthesis, and this, as well as cell death and neuronal loss, is
   abolished by antagonists of glutamate receptors and by L-NAME. Finally,
   poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) knock-out mice appear to be
   protected from monocular deprivation-induced cell death. In conclusion,
   during early postnatal development of the rat visual system monocular
   deprivation causes excitotoxic, nitric oxide-mediated, cell death in the
   dLGN that appears to be apoptotic and also requires activation of PARP.

   clinical symptoms in HP. In addition, mutation Arg117 --> His inhibits
   autocatalytic inactivation of trypsin, while mutation Asn21 --> Ile has
   no such effect. The findings strongly argue that increased trypsinogen
   activation in the pancreas is the common initiating step in both forms

Abstract = {{The aim of the present work was to analyze the effect of chronic stress
   on thyroid axis and its influence on the immune response. For this
   purpose a murine model of chronic stress was developed to evaluate and
   to correlate thyroid hormone levels with humoral alloimmune response.
   Results show a reduction in serum levels of thyroid hormones, specially
   a significant decrease in serum levels of triiodotyronine (T-3) in
   stressed animals. On the other hand, alloimmunization was not able to
   induce an early increment in T-3 and thyroxine (T-4) levels as it was
   previously reported in normal animals. In addition, lower titers of
   alloantibodies were obtained in animals under stress conditions as
   compared to normal mice. The sustitutive T-4 treatment in stressed
   animals increased significantly alloantibody production as well as the
   early increment in thyroid hormones after antigenic challenge. These
   findings suggest that chronic stress induces an alteration of the
   function of thyroid axis that alters the immune response. (C) 2000

Year = {{2000}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{609-619}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{A simple method was developed that enabled the enzymatic determination
   of the galactose distribution in galactomannans. endo-Mannanase of
   Aspergillus niger was used to degrade the galactomannan polymers and the
   degradation products were determined with high-performance
   anion-exchange chromatography. A whole range of commercial high-to-low
   substituted galactomannans was analyzed in this way. It was found that
   differences in the anion-exchange chromatograms reflected
   dissimilarities in the distribution of galactose and could be used
   directly to discern these dissimilarities. The differences among the
   various elution profiles were used to construct a similarity distance
   tree. In addition to this approach, the absolute amount of
   non-substituted mannose released by the enzyme was found to be a good
   discriminating factor. In this way, galactomannans with regular,
   blockwise, and randomly distributed galactose could be discerned. All
   guars and the highly substituted gum of Prosopis juliflora were found to
   have a blockwise distribution of galactose. For different batches of
   tara gum both random and blockwise distributions were found. Among
   batches of locust bean gum the greatest variation was observed: both
   random, blockwise, and ordered galactose distributions were present.
   Cassia gum was found to have a highly regular distribution of galactose.

Abstract = {{Association of the DNA end-binding Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer with the
   460-kDa serine/threonine kinase catalytic subunit forms the
   DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) that is required for double-strand
   break repair by non-homologous recombination in mammalian cells.
   Recently, we have proposed a model in which the kinase activity is
   required for translocation of the DNA end-binding subunit Ku along the
   DNA helix when DNA-PK assembles on DNA ends. Here, we have questioned
   the consequences of Ku entry into DNA on local DNA processes by using
   human nuclear cell extracts incubated in the presence of linearized
   plasmid DNA, As two model processes, we have chosen nucleotide excision
   repair (NER) of UVC DNA lesions and transcription from viral promoters.
   We show that although NER efficiency is strongly reduced on linear DNA,
   it can be fully restored in the presence of DNA-PK inhibitors.
   Simultaneously, the amount of NER proteins bound to the UVC-damaged
   linear DNA is increased and the amount of Ku bound to the same DNA
   molecules is decreased. Similarly, the poor transcription efficiency
   exhibited by viral promoters on linear DNA is enhanced in the presence
   of DNA-PK inhibitor concentrations that prevent Ku entry into the DNA
   substrate molecule, The present results show that DNA-PK catalytic
   activity can regulate DNA transactions including transcription in the
   vicinity of double-strand breaks by controlling Ku entry into DNA.}},

   (microwave-induced plasma) detection (CC-AED) has been accomplished
   using the 174 nm atomic emission line, but with very limited selectivity

   molecular band at 388 nm. A commercial GC-AED system was modified to
   allow the use of the 388 nm line for nitrogen detection, giving an
   improvement of 100-fold in sensitivity and selectivity, when compared
   with the 174 nm mode. Limits of detection of 10 pg/s were common,
   representing a 10-fold improvement. Compound-independent behavior was

Abstract = {{Sigma (sigma) receptors have been implicated in psychosis, cognition,

   signal transduction mechanisms for a receptors have not been fully
   elucidated. In this study, we examined the possible coupling between
   sigma (1) receptors and heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding
   proteins (G proteins) in rodent brain. In sigma (1) receptor-rich
   cerebellar membrane preparations, the competitive binding curves of two
   sigma (1) agonists, (+)pentazocine and
   1S,2R-(-)-cis-N-{[}2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-N-methyl-2-(1-pyrrolidin
   yl)cyclohexylamine (BD737), were unaffected by the addition of 10 muM
   guanosine-5'-O-(gamma -thio)-triphosphate (GTP gammaS). Neither
   (+)pentazocine (1-100 muM) nor BD737 (0.01-10 muM) stimulated GTPase
   activities significantly above basal levels in agonist-stimulated GTPase
   activity assays in cerebellar membranes. Furthermore, when using the
   method of agonist-stimulated {[}S-35]GTP gammaS binding as assessed by
   autoradiography, we did not observe significant stimulation of
   {[}S-35]GTP gammaS binding in rat brain sections by either
   (+)pentazocine or BD737. The above results demonstrate that the a,
   receptor is not likely be directly coupled to G proteins. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The neuropoietic cytokine ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) potently
   induces transcription of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene
   through a 180-base pair (bp) cytokine response element (CyRE) in the VIP
   promoter. We have previously shown that CNTF induction of STAT and AP-1
   protein binding within the CyRE is necessary to mediate CNTF induction
   of VIP gene transcription. We now show that a third, previously
   uncharacterized site at the S'-end of the CyRE is also critical to CNTF
   induction of CyRE transcription. A 4-bp mutation in this 3'-region
   reduced CNTF-mediated induction of transcription similar to 80\%.
   Whereas mutations in both the STAT and AP-1 sites substantially reduced
   CNTF induction of transcription, mutations in these sites together with
   the novel 3'-site completely abolished the ability of CNTF to induce
   CyRE-mediated transcription. Gel shift analysis indicated that a complex
   in neuroblastoma cells bound specifically to this 3'-site. This complex
   was not altered by CNTF treatment. Mutations in an 8-bp sequence
   (TTACTGGA) eliminated binding of this protein complex and markedly
   reduced transcriptional activation of the CyRE by CNTF. Thus, we have
   identified a protein complex binding to a novel DNA sequence that is
   necessary for full CNTF induction of VIP gene transcription.}},

Abstract = {{Visceral leishmaniasis (V.L.) is associated with enhanced lipid
   peroxidation along with impaired function of antioxidant defense system
   in erythrocytes. The effect of chronic treatment with ascorbate and
   alpha -tocopherol was studied on erythrocytes in hamsters infected with
   Leishmania donovani. Combination treatment with both antioxidants proved
   to be a potential suppressor of lipid hydroperoxide formation as well as
   hypotonic osmotic lysis during the leishmanial infection. Positive
   correlations between the depleted levels of erythrocyte ascorbate, GSH
   and alpha -tocopherol exhibit proportionate alterations in the
   nonenzymatic antioxidant levels at different stages of infection.
   Indirect measurement of transmembrane electron transfer as ferricyanide
   reduction suggests an active participation of endogenous contents of
   ascorbate and alpha -tocopherol in the protection against oxidative
   damage of membrane lipids. Cooperative behavior of both antioxidants in
   the ferricyanide reducing capacity was further evinced by resealing the
   ghosts in presence of exogenous ascorbate and alpha -tocopherol.
   Furthermore, intravesicular ascorbate serves in the defense of
   extravesicular ferricyanide induced oxidation of endogenous alpha
   -tocopherol. The results suggest an interacting role of ascorbate and
   alpha -tocopherol in maintaining the antioxidant reserve of erythrocytes
   during anemia in V.L. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Although activated Ras proteins are usually associated with driving
   growth and transformation, they may also induce senescence, apoptosis,
   and terminal differentiation. The subversion of these anti-neoplastic
   effects during Ras-dependent tumor development may be as important as
   the acquisition of the pro-neoplastic effects. None of the currently
   identified potential Ras effector proteins can satisfactorily explain
   the apoptotic action of Ras. Consequently, we have sought to identify
   novel Ras effecters that may be responsible for apoptosis induction. By
   examining the EST data base, we identified a potential. Ras association
   domain in the tumor suppressor RASSF1. We now show that RASSF1 binds Ras
   in a GTP-dependent manner, both in vivo and directly in vitro. Moreover,
   activated Ras enhances and dominant negative Ras inhibits the cell death
   induced by transient transfection of RASSF1 into 293-T cells. This cell
   death appears to be apoptotic in nature, as RASSF1-transfected 293-T
   cells exhibit membrane blebbing and can be rescued by the addition of a
   caspase inhibitor. Thus, the RASSF1 tumor suppressor may serve as a
   novel Ras effector that mediates the apoptotic effects of oncogenic Ras.}},

Abstract = {{A framework to determine the quantum efficiency eta of a photoreaction
   in a porous layer of a photocatalyst is presented, The procedure relies
   on a model of the photoproduct diffusion in the porous structure of the
   photocatalyst. The model incorporates a position-dependent source term
   mirroring the Light intensity profile in the layer and an effective
   diffusion coefficient D-eff It allows for a simultaneous determination
   of eta as well as of D-eff. The method is applied to the photosynthesis
   of CH4 from gaseous H2O and CO2 at the solid/gas interface of a porous
   layer of TiO2 (Degussa P25). A value of eta = (8.79 +/- 0.79) x 10(-4)
   is found for the formation of CH4. The effective diffusion coefficient
   for the photoproduct CHS is D-eff = (5.64 +/- 2.51) x 10(-10) cm(2)
   s(-1). This value is much too low to be explained by classical Knudsen
   diffusion in the layers with an experimentally determined porosity phi =
   0.58. We suggest that the TiO2 layers contain a large number of
   unconnected pores separated by walls of densely packed microcrystals
   almost impenetrable for gases such as CH4 Whether processes other than
   diffusion are also responsible for the small value of D-eff is not clear
   at present.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent studies indicate that magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) after the administration of contrast material can be used to
   distinguish between reversible and irreversible myocardial ischemic
   injury regardless of the extent of wall motion or the age of the
   infarct. We hypothesized that the results of contrast-enhanced MRI can
   be used to predict whether regions of abnormal ventricular contraction
   will improve after revascularization in patients with coronary artery
   disease.
   Methods: Gadolinium-enhanced MRI was performed in 50 patients with
   ventricular dysfunction before they underwent surgical or percutaneous
   revascularization. The transmural extent of hyperenhanced regions was
   postulated to represent the transmural extent of nonviable myocardium.
   The extent of regional contractility at the same locations was
   determined by cine MRI before and after revascularization in 41
   patients.
   Results: Contrast-enhanced MRI showed hyperenhancement of myocardial
   tissue in 40 of 50 patients before revascularization. In all patients
   with hyperenhancement the difference in image intensity between
   hyperenhanced regions and regions without hyperenhancement was more than
   6 SD. Before revascularization, 804 of the 2093 myocardial segments
   analyzed (38 percent) had abnormal contractility, and 694 segments (33
   percent) had some areas of hyperenhancement. In an analysis of all 804
   dysfunctional segments, the likelihood of improvement in regional
   contractility after revascularization decreased progressively as the
   transmural extent of hyperenhancement before revascularization increased
   (P<0.001). For instance, contractility increased in 256 of 329 segments
   (78 percent) with no hyperenhancement before revascularization, but in
   only 1 of 58 segments with hyperenhancement of more than 75 percent of
   tissue. The percentage of the left ventricle that was both dysfunctional
   and not hyperenhanced before revascularization was strongly related to
   the degree of improvement in the global mean wall-motion score (P<0.001)
   and the ejection fraction (P<0.001) after revascularization.
   Conclusions: Reversible myocardial dysfunction can be identified by
   contrast-enhanced MRI before coronary revascularization. (N Engl J Med

Abstract = {{Cancer results from disturbances of cellular signal transduction and
   data processing at the genetic and epigenetic level. In the early phase
   of the disease these disturbances are mainly caused by environmental
   toxic agents, i.e. genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens, whereas
   endogenous agents derived from dys-regulated metabolic reactions may
   take over this role at later stages, thereby leading to a state of
   `genetic instability' and `growth autonomy'. Among these metabolic
   reactions becoming dys-regulated in the course of tumorigenesis,
   eicosanoid biosynthesis from arachidonic acid seems to play a particular
   role. A steadily increasing body of evidence indicates a causal
   relationship between cancer development and an abnormal overexpression
   of eicosanoid-forming enzymes, i.e, cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases,
   in a wide variety of human and animal tumors. This overexpression seems
   to result from disturbances of cellular signaling cascades such as the
   Ras-Raf-MAPkinase cascade due to oncogenic gene mutations. Presently,
   research is focussed on the proinflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2
   (COX-2) the pathological overexpression of which has been found to be
   related to key events of tumor promotion such as cellular
   hyperproliferation, inhibition of programmed cell death, and tumor
   angiogenesis. In the mouse skin model of multistage carcinogenesis
   COX-2-derived prostaglandin F-2 alpha has been indentified as an
   endogenous tumor promoter. Moreover, genotoxic byproducts of both
   cylooxygenase and lipoxygenase-catalyzed arachidonic acid metabolism
   (such as active oxygen species, free radicals etc.) are suspected to
   contribute to `genetic instability' and thus to malignant progression of
   tumor cells. The enzymes of eicosanoid biosynthesis rank therefore among
   the most attractive targets for cancer chemoprevention. In fact, both
   nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, i.e. non-specific COX inhibitors,
   and isozyme-specific COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to inhibit
   experimental and human cancer development, in the latter case in
   particular in the large bowel. Beside their role as indicators of
   neoplastic development eicosanoids may be also used as reporters of skin
   irritation. Based to this concept an in vitro test system for skin
   toxicity has been developed in which the release of arachidonic acid and
   interleukin-lcr, i.e. two key mediators of acute inflammation, from a
   human keratinocyte cell line is measured. The excellent correlation
   found between this mediator release and the effects of various chemical
   irritants on human skin in vivo indicates that, in the near future, this
   and related methods may help to do without animal experiments in
   toxicological testing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Introduction. Several infections agents have been found to be involved
   in atherogenesis over the past decade. Chlamydia pneumoniae is one of
   the commonest associated agents. In this study we hale analysed the
   possible relationship between a high level of antibodies to Chlamydia,
   and the presence of carotid ultrasound changes in patients who have had
   strokes. Patients and methods. We studied 230 patients admitted
   consecutively to the Stroke Unit in our hospital, with the diagnosis of
   stroke. All the patients in the group had carotid duplex ultrasound
   studies to assess the degree of stenosis. All these patients also had
   serological studies using micro-immunofluorescence to detect antibodies
   to Chlamydia pneumoniae. Results. Only 35 patients were found to have
   positive Chlamydia pneumoniae serology. The degree of atheromatosis was
   similar in the patients with high levels of IgG for Chlamydia pneumoniae
   and in those with normal serology. There was no statistically
   significant relation between the degree of stenosis and being
   seropositive for Chlamydiae Conclusions. Our findings suggest that in an
   unselected population of stroke patients there is no relations between
   carotid atheromatosis and positive serology findings to Chlamydia
   pneumoniae. If there is any relationship between Chlamydia pneumoniae
   and carotid atheromatosis, serology does not seem to be a technique
   which is suitable for its assessment.}},

Abstract = {{The sheep disease maedi-visna (MV) was introduced into Finland in 1981
   and had spread to eight flocks in the southwestern part of the country
   when first detected in a survey in 1994. Six more seropositive flocks
   were subsequently traced, bringing the total to 14. MV has a notifiable
   disease status in Finland that provides for official restrictive
   measures to which all infected herds are subject. These measures are
   withdrawn once the seropositive animals and their progeny are culled and
   the flock has showed negative signs in the test done twice, or after
   total culling. A voluntary control programme was initiated in January
   1995 to extend official control efforts. The programme furnishes a
   guideline for culling, restrictions on contacts, and a timetable for
   testing the flock to attain MV-free status. Seven flocks of the 14 were
   slaughtered either immediately or after a period under restrictive
   measures. One flock finished sheep production after four years under
   restrictive measures. Selective culling and repeated testing was
   attempted with the other six flocks, three of which attained MV-free
   status. One flock finished sheep production after two years in the
   control programme, the other two dropped out of the programme when the
   restrictive measures were withdrawn. It was concluded that the control
   programme was salient in eradicating MV from Finland and that
   serological monitoring of the situation must be continuous. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Vibration protection of sensitive electronic equipment which operates in
   harsh environments often relies on resilient mounts. The traditional
   optimal design of vibration isolation from harmonic vibration is based
   on compromising damping and stiffness properties of mounts and is aimed,
   in general, at widening the frequency range over which the attenuation
   takes place, subject to limitations imposed on the rattlespace of the
   electronic box. Such a design typically incurs the use of heavily damped
   vibration isolators. Nevertheless, the reliability of the electronic
   instrumentation depends not only on the level of vibration experienced
   by the electronic box, but also, and primarily, on the vibration
   responses of the internal components that are often lightly damped and
   extremely responsive over a wide frequency range. The traditional
   approach, however, completely ignores the presence of such components.
   The heavily damped vibration isolators result in poor vibration
   isolation over the high-frequency span which typically contains resonant
   frequencies for critical internal components and, therefore, are
   insufficient for maintaining a fail-safe vibration environment for
   electronic equipment. The proposed design approach focuses primarily on
   the dynamic properties and responses of the critical internal components
   of an electronic device. In this instance, the heavy and rigid
   electronic box is thought of and utilised as the first-level vibration
   isolation stage (mechanical low-pass filter) relative to the sensitive
   internal components. The optimally chosen elastic and damping properties
   of the vibration isolators minimise the vibration experienced by the
   critical internal components, subject to restraints imposed on the peak
   deflections of the electronic box. The optimisation procedure relies on
   an analytical solution. The results of calculations are proven
   experimentally. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{We generalize the results of Polchinski and Strassler regarding the N=1
   preserving mass deformation of N=4 SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM)
   theories and its string theory dual to SO(N) and USp(2N) gauge groups.
   The string theory duals involve 5-branes wrapped on RP2. In order to
   match with the field theory classification of vacua, the 3-brane charge
   carried by such 5-branes must be shifted by a half, and this follows
   from a conjectured generalization of results of Freed and Witten. Our
   results provide an elegant physical picture for the classification of
   classically massive vacua in the mass-deformed N=4 theories.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of the scattering of nitric oxide (NO) from
   well-characterized and ordered layers of carbon monoxide (CO) and
   ethylidyne (CCH3) adsorbed on a Pt(111) substrate have been investigated
   through resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) measurements
   of the rotational quantum state distributions of the scattered NO
   molecules for a range of incident NO translational energies between 10
   and 50 kJ mol(-1) from scattering substrates at 108 and 300 K. The
   measurements reveal that, where in principle the interaction potential
   resembles that of the NO-Ag(111) system more so than that of the
   NO-Pt(111) system, the scattering differs remarkably from that expected
   from a weakly bound system in that it occurs both into a
   trapping-desorption channel and a direct inelastic channel. Experimental
   data are presented that indicate both an incident translational energy
   dependence and substrate surface temperature dependence of the
   scattering, which is interpreted in terms of a hard-cube model. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Fundamental photophysical parameters have been determined for several

   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry.
   Fluorescence quantum efficiencies (phi (qe)), singlet decay rates
   (k(1)), vibrationless ground-singlet transition energies and average
   fluorescence wavelengths have been obtained from solid and solution
   samples by quantitative optical measurements. This new data will assist
   in modelling calculations of MALDI processes and in highlighting
   desirable characteristics of MALDI matrices. phi (qe) may be as high as
   0.59 whilst the radiative decay rate (k(f)) appears to be within the
   (0.8-4) x 10(8) s(-1) range. Interestingly, alpha
   -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (alpha -CHC) has a very low phi (qe) and
   fast non-radiative decay rate which would imply a rapid and efficient
   thermalisation of electronic excitation. This is in keeping with
   observations that alpha -CHC exhibits low threshold fluences for ion
   detection and the low fluences at which alpha -CHC tends to fragment.

Abstract = {{The use of near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor a submerged
   filamentous bacterial bioprocess was investigated. An industrial strain
   of the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces fradiae was cultured in a 12
   litre stirred tank reactor (STR) using a complex medium. This mycelial 4
   phase toil, water, gas and solid) system produced highly complex and
   variable matrices, therefore monitoring such a complex fluid with NIRS
   represented a considerable challenge. Nevertheless, successful models
   for four key analytes (methyl oleate, glucose, glutamate and ammonium)
   were built at-line (rapid off-line) using NIRS. In the present study,
   the methods used to formulate, select and validate the models for the
   key analytes are discussed, with particular emphasis on how the model
   performance can be critically evaluated. Since previous reports on NIRS
   in monitoring bioprocesses have either involved simpler matrices, or, in
   filamentous systems, have not discussed how NIRS models can be
   critically assessed, the emphasis in the present study on providing an
   insight into the modelling process in such a complex matrix, may be
   particularly important to the applicability of NIRS to such industrial
   bioprocesses. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In general the biodegradation of nonchlorinated aliphatic and aromatic
   hydrocarbons is influenced by their bioavailability. Hydrocarbons are
   very poorly soluble in water. They are easily adsorbed to clay or humus
   fractions in the soil, and pass very slowly to the aqueous phase, where
   they are metabolised by microorganisms. Surfactants that increase their
   solubility and improve their bioavailability can thereby accelerate
   degradation. Cyclodextrins are natural compounds that form soluble
   complexes with hydrophobic molecules. They are widely used in medicine
   and harmless to microorganisms and enzymes. This paper describes their
   in vitro effect on the biodegradative activity of a microbial population
   isolated from a petroleum-polluted soil, as shown by the decrease of
   dodecane (C12), tetracosane (C24) anthracene and naphthalene added
   individually as the sole carbon source to mineral medium liquid
   cultures. beta -cyclodextrin accelerated the degradation of all four
   hydrocarbons, particularly naphthalene, and influenced the growth
   kinetics as shown by a higher biomass yield and better utilization of
   hydrocarbon as a carbon and energy source. Its low cost,
   biocompatibility and effective acceleration of degradation make beta
   -cyclodextrin an attractive option for bioremediation. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Protein synthesis inhibitors block the maintenance of NMDA
   receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) both in vivo and in
   vitro. Protein synthesis inhibitors block mossy fiber( MF) LTP
   maintenance in vitro, but little is known about the effect of protein
   synthesis inhibitors on either induction or maintenance in MF-LTP in
   vivo. Here we study the role of protein synthesis in the induction of
   long-term potentiation at the mossy fiber-CA3 hippocampal synapse in
   vivo in anesthetized rats. The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin
   was administered at different doses (0.04, 10, or 40 nmol) into area CA3
   15 min before delivering high-frequency stimulation (two times at 100
   Hz, 1 sec). Anisomycin blocked MF-LTP induction in a dose-dependent
   manner; both 40 and 10 nmol blocked MF-LTP induction, but a lower dose
   of 0.04 nmol was without effect. The inhibitory effect of anisomycin on
   protein synthesis was determined by measuring the incorporation of
   {[}S-35] methionine into the newly synthesized proteins. Percentages of
   protein synthesis inhibition were determined by comparing {[}S-35]
   incorporation of anisomycin-treated samples with vehicle controls. Doses
   of 0.04, 10, or 40 nmol of anisomycin produced 21, 82, or 83\%
   inhibition of {[}S-35] methionine incorporation, respectively. The
   effect of anisomycin was verified using a single dose of the protein
   synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (40 nmol). Cycloheximide also blocked
   MF-LTP induction. These results suggest that protein synthesis plays an
   important role in the induction of mossy fiber long-term potentiation in

Abstract = {{The imidazoquinoline R-848, originally identified as a highly effective
   antiviral agent, has recently been shown to be capable of potent B
   lymphocyte activation. The B cell-activating properties of R-848 are
   strikingly similar to the effects of the CD40 ligand CD154, The present
   study demonstrates that this similarity extends to the intracellular
   signaling pathways triggered by the compound, although both overlapping
   and distinct mechanisms of signaling were seen. Like CD40 ligation,
   R-848 stimulated activation of the stress-activated protein kinases
   c-Jun kinase and p38 and activated the NF-kappaB family of transcription
   factors. Both R-848 and CD40-mediated B cell differentiation were
   dependent upon NF-kappaB activation, although the relative importance of
   individual NF-kappaB family members appeared to differ between R-848-
   and CD40-mediated signals, Both signals were partially dependent upon
   induction of TNF-alpha and IL-6, and the cytoplasmic adaptor molecule
   TNF receptor-associated factor 2 is involved in both R-848- and
   CD40-mediated differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{The cell-cycle regulator p16 inhibits the complex cdk4-cyclin DI and
   controls G1-S transition. In human tumors, p16 inactivation is often
   accomplished by homozygous deletion (HD) of its encoding gene, CDKN2A,
   Methylation of the 5' CpG island promoter has been proposed as an
   alternative mechanism of inactivation. Expression of p16, CDKN2A HD and
   5' CDKN2A CpG island methylation was studied in 25 oligodendrogliomas by
   immunohistochemistry and PCR amplification, Ten oligodendrogliomas were
   p16-immunonegative, and CDKN2A HD was determined in 8 of these cases. in
   the 2 immunonegative cases without HD, no CpG island methylation was
   found, The absence of CpG island methylation in the p16-immunonegative
   cases without HD suggests either non-genetic regulation of p16 or
   different genetic changes, CDKN2A HD did not correlate with histological
   grading (p = n.s.); however, it showed a correlation with survival (p =
   0.03), supporting an important role of CDKN2A in the prognosis of
   oligodendrogliomas. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Mild hyperhomocysteinemia is recognized as a risk factor for venous
   thromboembolism (VTE), though its role in the thrombogenic processes is
   not understood. Its possible association with impaired fibrinolysis was
   investigated in 157 patients (61 women, 96 men) below the age of 60
   years (43+/-11, mean+/-SD) with a history of objectively confirmed VTE.
   Patients had significantly higher fasting total plasma homocysteine
   (tHcy) levels than 138 apparently healthy subjects (8.0, 6.6-9.9 mu
   mol/L vs. 7.2, 5.9-8.6 mu mol/L, P=0.001; median, range between first
   and third quartile). In 17 of 157 patients (12\%) hyperhomocysteinemia
   (tHcy>11.4 mu mol/L for women and tHcy>12.6 mu mol/L for men) was
   established. The adjusted odds ratio as an estimate of relative risk for
   VTE was 2.3 (0.8-7.0; 95\% confidence interval). When patients with
   hyperhomocysteinemia were compared to patients without
   hyperhomocysteinemia, no significant differences in t-PA (antigen
   9.2+/-5.5 mug/L and 9.7+/-4.7 mug/L, respectively; activity 1.3+/-0.5
   IU/mL and 1.3+/-0.7 IU/mL, respectively) and PAI-1 (antigen 19.3+/-17.5
   mug/L and 22.6+/-20.4 mug/L, respectively; activity 15.01+/-12.6 and
   15.8+/-13.3 IU/mL, respectively) were observed. In conclusion, this
   study showed an association between mild hyperhomocysteinemia and VTE,
   but provided no evidence for an independent association between
   hyperhomocysteinemia and alterations in fibrinolytic proteins. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The vertebrate inner ear is structurally complex, consisting of
   fluid-filled tubules and sensory organs that subserve the functions of
   hearing and balance. The epithelial parts of the inner ear are derived
   from the otic placode, which deepens to form a cup before closing to
   form the otic vesicle. We fate-mapped the rim of the otic cup to monitor
   the cellular movements associated with otocyst formation and to aid in
   interpreting the changing gene expression patterns of the early otic
   field. Twelve sites around the rim, defined as positions of a clock
   face, were targeted by iontophoretic injection of fluorescent,
   lipophilic dye. Labeled cells were imaged 24 and 48 h after injection.
   The data show that the entire dorsal rim of the otic cup becomes the
   endolymphatic duct (ED), while the posteroventral rim becomes the
   lateral otocyst wall. Two intersecting boundaries of lineage restriction
   were identified near the dorsal pole: one bisecting the ED into anterior
   and posterior halves and the other defining its lateral edge. We
   hypothesize that signaling across compartment boundaries may play a
   critical role in duct specification. This model is discussed in the
   context of mouse mutants that are defective in both hindbrain
   development and ED outgrowth. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The yeast ribosomal GTPase associated center is made of parts of the 26S
   rRNA domains II and VI, and a number of proteins including P0, P1 alpha,
   P1 beta, P2 alpha, P2 beta and L12, Mapping of the rRNA neighborhood of
   the proteins was performed by footprinting in ribosomes from yeast
   strains lacking different GTPase components, The absence of protein PO
   dramatically increases the sensitivity of the defective ribosome to
   degradation hampering the RNA footprinting, In ribosomes lacking the
   P1/P2 complex, protection of a number of nucleotides is detected around
   positions 840, 880, 1100, 1220-1280 and 1350 in domain II as well as in
   several positions in the domain VI alpha -sarcin region, The protection
   pattern resembles the one reported for the interaction of elongation
   factors in bacterial systems. The results exclude a direct interaction
   of these proteins with the rRNA and are compatible with an increase in
   the ribosome affinity for EF-2 in the absence of the acidic P proteins,
   Interestingly, a sordarin derivative inhibitor of EF-2 causes an
   opposite effect, increasing the reactivity in positions protected by the
   absence of P1/P2, Similarly, a deficiency in protein L12 exposes
   nucleotides G1235, G1242, A1262, A1269, A1270 and A1272 to chemical
   modification, thus situating the protein binding site in the most
   conserved part of the 26S rRNA, equivalent to the bacterial protein L11
   binding site.}},

Abstract = {{TIGR/MYOC, a novel 504 amino acids (aa) protein of unknown function, has
   recently been linked to glaucoma. The protein is both intra- and
   extracellular and most known mutations map to its C-terminus, an
   olfactomedin-like domain. To investigate the properties of a TIGR/MYOC
   peptide lacking this important domain, we constructed a
   replication-deficient adenovirus with the first 344 aa and
   over-expressed the truncated protein in primary human trabecular
   meshwork cells and perfused human anterior segment cultures. The
   truncated mutant contains the entire N-terminus plus 98 aa of the
   olfactomedin-like domain. We found that the delivered truncated mutant
   accumulates inside the cell, reduces secretion of endogenous TIGR/MYOC
   and induces an increase in outflow facility at 48 h post-infection.
   Based on these findings, we hypothesize that TIGR/MYOC might have a dual
   role in trabecular meshwork function. This dual role might be that of an
   intracellular modulator of vesicular transport as well as that of a
   secreted protein involved in extracellular matrix conformation. Both
   functions could have a direct effect in maintaining aqueous humor
   outflow facility. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To estimate the effects of consuming hot beverages, including mate (an
   infusion of the herb Ilex paraguayensis), tea, coffee and coffee with
   milk, and other food items on esophageal cancer risk, we analyzed data
   from 830 cases and 1,779 controls participating in a series of 5
   hospital-based case-control studies of squamous-cell carcinoma of the
   esophagus conducted in high-risk areas of South America After adjusting
   for the strong effects of tobacco and alcohol consumption, both heavy
   mate drinking (> 1 l/day) and self-reported very hot mate drinking were
   significantly associated with esophageal cancer risk in men and women.
   The magnitude and strength of the association for mate amount and, to a
   lesser extent, mate temperature were higher for women than men. The
   joint effects of mate amount and mate temperature were more than
   multiplicative, following a statistically significant synergistic
   interaction (p = 0.02) which was particularly evident among heavy
   drinkers (>1.50 l/day) of very hot mate (odds ratio = 4.14, 95\%
   confidence interval: 2.24-7.67) compared to light drinkers (<0.50 l/day)
   of cold/warm/hot mate. Consumption of other very hot beverages, such as
   tea and coffee with milk but not coffee alone, was also significantly
   associated with an increased risk, in the 2- to 4-fold range.
   Statistically significant protective associations were identified for
   high consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals and tea. In contrast.
   frequent consumption of meat, animal fats and salt was associated with a
   moderately increased risk. This pooled analysis adds evidence for a
   carcinogenic effect of chronic thermal injury in the esophagus induced
   by the consumption of very hot drinks, including mate. Our study further
   confirms the protective effect of a dietary pattern characterized by
   daily consumption of fruits and vegetables and low consumption of meat
   and animal fats. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of iodine-131
   (I-131)-labeled 81C6 antitenascin monoclonal antibody (mAb) administered
   clinically into surgically created resection cavities (SCRCs) in
   malignant glioma patients and to identify any objective responses with
   this treatment.
   Patients and Methods: In this phase I trial,newly diagnosed patients
   with malignant gliomas with no prior external-beam therapy or
   chemotherapy were treated with a single injection of I-131-labeled 81C6
   through a Rickham reservoir into the resection cavity. The initial dose
   was 20 mCi and escalation wets in 20-mCi increments. Patients were
   observed for toxicity and response until death or for a minimum of 1
   year after treatment.
   Results: We treated 42 patients with I-131-labeled 81C6 mAb in
   administered doses up to 180 mCi. Dose- limiting toxicity wets observed
   at doses greater than 120 mCi and consisted of delayed neurotoxicity.
   None of the patients developed major hematologic toxicity. Median
   survival for patients with glioblastoma multiforme and for all patients
   was 69 and 79 weeks, respectively.
   Conclusion: The MTD for administration of I-131-labeled 81C6 into the
   SCRC of newly diagnosed patients with no prior radiation therapy or
   chemotherapy was 120 mCi. Dose-limiting toxicity was delayed neurologic
   toxicity. We are encouraged by the survival and toxicity and by the low
   2.5\% prevalence of debulking surgery for symptomatic radiation
   necrosis. (C) 2000 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{3893-3914}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{This research is an attempt to understand the dynamical mechanisms that
   drive the wintertime North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) on monthly and
   longer timescales. In an earlier work by DeWeaver and Nigam, the authors
   showed that momentum fluxes from stationary waves play a large role in
   maintaining the zonal-mean zonal wind ((u) over bar) perturbations
   associated with the NAG. In this paper, a linear stationary wave model
   is used to show that zonal-mean flow anomalies in turn play a large role
   in maintaining the NAO stationary waves. A strong two-way coupling thus
   exists between ((u) over bar) and the stationary waves, in which each is
   both a source of and a response to the other.
   When forced by zonal-eddy coupling terms-terms that represent the
   interaction between NAO-covariant zonal-mean zonal wind anomalies and
   the climatological eddy flow-together with heating and transient fluxes,
   the model produces a realistic simulation of the observed stationary
   wave pattern. Zonal-eddy coupling terms make the largest contribution to
   the simulated stationary waves. Every feature of the stationary wave
   pattern is forced to some extent by zonal-eddy coupling, and the
   upper-level trough over Greenland is forced almost entirely by the
   coupling terms. The stationary waves generated by zonal-eddy coupling
   are well positioned to provide additional momentum to the ((u) over bar)
   anomalies, demonstrating the strong positive feedback between zonal-mean
   and eddy Row components.
   The NAO is known for its effect on tropospheric temperatures over
   northern Eurasia, and the model produces a realistic simulation of these
   temperature changes at midtropospheric levels. Zonal-eddy coupling,
   including the zonal advection of land-sea thermal contrasts, is partly
   responsible for the temperature changes. However, diabatic heating
   anomalies associated with the displacement of the Atlantic storm track
   are also influential, causing more than half of the warming over
   Scandinavia and most of cooling from North Africa to the Caspian Sea.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), through activation of its
   endothelial receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, is an important positive
   modulator of tumor angiogenesis and edema in solid tumors such as
   malignant astrocytomas. Neuropilin-1 (Npn-l) is a transmembrane receptor
   expressed by both endothelial and non-endothelial cells, including tumor
   cells. Npn-l has been postulated to function as a co-factor in
   activation of the biologically relevant VEGFR-2, by the most abundant
   VEGF165 isoform. However, the function of Npn-1 in normal and
   pathological angiogenesis, its expression pattern in relation to VEGF in
   tumors such as astrocytomas and whether it is similarly or
   differentially regulated compared to VEGF remain unknown. In our study,
   the expression pattern of Npn-l and VEGF by human astrocytoma cell lines
   and specimens was closely correlated and associated with malignant
   astrocytomas, Mitogens, such as epidermal growth factor and activation
   of p21-Ras, previously demonstrated to be relevant in astrocytoma
   proliferation and induction of VEGF, also induce Npn-l expression.
   Hypoxia, the main physiological inducer of VEGF expression, decreased
   Npn-l expression. Increased Npn-l expression was also demonstrated in a
   transgenic mouse astrocytoma model. Astrocytomas are an ideal system for
   furthering our understanding of the functional relevance, if any, of
   Npn-l in tumor angiogenesis, (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Stress-activated protein kinase 1 (SAPK1), also called c-Jun N-terminal
   kinase (JNK), becomes activated in vivo in response to pro-inflammatory
   cytokines or cellular stresses. Its full activation requires the
   phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in a Thr-Pro-Tyr
   motif, which can be catalysed by the protein kinases mitogen-activated
   protein kinase kinase (MKK)4 and MKK7. Here we report that MKK4 shows a
   striking preference for the tyrosine residue (Tyr-185), and MKK7 a
   striking preference for the threonine residue (Thr-183) in three
   SAPK1/JNK1 isoforms tested (JNK1 alpha1, JNK2 alpha2 and JNK3 alpha1).
   For this reason, MKK4 and MKK7 together produce a synergistic increase
   in the activity of each SAPK1/JNK isoform in vitro. The MKK7 beta
   variant, which is several hundred-fold more efficient in activating all
   three SAPK1/JNK isoforms than is MKK7 alpha', is equally specific for
   Thr-183. MKK7 also phosphorylates JNK2a2 at Thr-404 and Ser-407 in
   vitro, Ser-407 being phosphorylated much more rapidly than Th-183 in
   vitro, Thr-404/Ser-407 are phosphorylated in unstimulated human KB cells
   and HEK-293 cells, and phosphorylation is increased in response to an
   osmotic stress (0.5 M sorbitol), However, in contrast with Thr-183 and
   Tyr-185, the phosphorylation of Thr-404 and Ser-407 is not increased in
   response to other agonists that activate MKK7 and SAPK1/JNK, suggesting
   that phosphorylation of these residues is catalysed by another protein
   kinase, such as CK2, which also phosphorylates Thr-404 and Ser-407 in
   vitro. MKK3, MKK4 and MKK6 all show a strong preference for
   phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of the Thr-Gly-Tyr motifs in
   their known substrates SAPK2a/p38, SAPK3/p38 gamma and SAPK4/p38 delta.
   MKK7 also phosphorylates SAPK2a/p38 at a low rate (but not SAPK3/p38
   gamma or SAPK4/p38 delta), and phosphorylation occurs exclusively at the
   tyrosine residue, demonstrating that MKK7 is intrinsically a
   `dual-specific' protein kinase.}},

   properties e.g. volatility and solubility), were measured above aqueous
   sucrose solutions {[}0-65\% (w/v)]. As sugar concentration increased,
   the headspace concentration of some compounds increased, whilst others
   stayed the same or decreased. The changes in volatile headspace:
   concentrations were correlated (using partial least squares regression)
   with a range of physicochemical descriptors which were calculated from
   the compound structure. The model was composed of seven physicochemical
   descriptors and had a regression coefficient, R-2 = 0.74. An external

Abstract = {{The cytochrome b(5) tail is a 43-residue membrane-embedded domain that
   is responsible for anchoring the catalytic domain of cytochrome b(5) to
   the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Different models for the structure
   of the membrane dom ain of cytochrome b(5) have been proposed, including
   a helical hairpin and a single transmembrane helix. In the present
   study, CD spectroscopy was used to investigate the conformation of th
   tail in different environments, and as a function of temperature, with
   the goal of understanding the nature of the membrane-bound conformation.
   Whereas residue property profiling indicates that bending of a helix in
   the middle of the peptide might be possible, the experimental results in
   small unilamellar vesicles and lysophosphatidylcholine micelles are more
   consistent with a single transmembrane helix. Furthermore, although
   there is evidence for some refolding of the polypeptide with
   temperature, this is not consistent with a hairpin-to-transmembrane
   transition. Rather, it appears to represent an increase in helical
   content in fluid lipid environments, perhaps involving residues at the
   ends of the transmembrane segment.}},

Abstract = {{An examination of 50 years of the National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP)-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
   reanalysis from 1949 to 1998 reveals that significant spurious trends
   occur in the surface pressure held. Long-term surface pressure
   reductions are apparent south of 45 degreesS. The largest trend in
   surface pressure is near 65 degreesS where an approximately steady
   long-term pressure reduction of about 0.20 hPa yr(-1) (10 hPa in 50 yr)
   is located. The negative pressure trend represents a gradual reduction
   in a positive bias for the reanalysis Observations at Antarctic stations
   do not support this long-term trend, although short-term interannual
   variations are reasonably well captured after about 1970. The negative
   pressure tendency near 65 degreesS continues well into the 1990s
   although a reasonable number of stations between 65 degrees and 70
   degreesS began taking observations along the coast of east Antarctica
   during the 1950s and 1960s. Few Antarctic observations, however, are
   used by the reanalysis until about 1968, and the quality of the pressure
   field for the reanalysis appears poor in high southern latitudes prior
   to then. The trend in high southern latitudes appears to be a component
   of global temporal variations in the reanalysis;some of which are
   supported by observations but others are not.
   In the Southern Hemisphere, the sea level pressure difference between 40
   degrees and 60 degreesS, an indicator of westerly wind intensity,
   increases approximately from 20 hPa in the early 1950s to 25 hPa in the
   early 1970s and 28 hPa in recent years. The relatively high density of
   observing stations along the Antarctic Peninsula, however, results in an
   approximately steady local surface pressure after the pressure fell
   about 4 hPa during the late 1950s. Based upon these findings,
   researchers should account for jumps and long-term trends when making
   use of the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Alterations in the p53 gene occur frequently and can lead to
   accumulation of p53 protein in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and
   neck (SCCHN), Since accumulation of p53 is associated with enhanced
   presentation of wild-type sequence (wt) p53 peptides to immune cells,
   the development of pan vaccines against SCCHN has focused on,vt p53
   epitopes, We used the HLA-A2.1-restricted wt p53(264-272) epitope to
   generate CTL from circulating precursor T cells of HLA-A2.1(+) healthy
   donors and patients with SCCHN, Autologous peptide-pulsed dendritic
   cells were used for in vitro sensitization, CTL specific for the wt
   p53(264-272) peptide were generated from PBMC obtained from two of seven
   normal donors and three of seven patients with SCCHN, These CTL were HLA
   class I restricted and responded to T2 cells pulsed with p53(264-272)
   peptide as well as HLA-A2-matched SCCHN cell lines naturally presenting
   the epitope, Paradoxically, none of the tumors in the three patients who
   generated CTL could adequately present the epitope; two had a nt p53
   genotype and no p53 protein accumulation, while the third tumor
   expressed a point mutation (R to H) in codon 273 that prevents
   presentation of the p53(264-272) epitope, In contrast, patients who did
   not generate CTL had tumors that accumulated altered p53 and potentially
   could present the p53(264-272) epitope. These findings suggest that in
   vivo, CTL specific for the wt p53(264-272) peptide might play a role in
   the elimination of tumor cells expressing this epitope and in
   immunoselection of epitope-loss tumor cells, Immunoselection of tumors
   that become resistant to anti-p53 immune responses has important
   implications for future p53-based vaccination strategies.}},

Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Ozone stimulates the ``defensive{''} C-fibers in the lungs, changing
   breathing pattern to rapid and shallow. Ne hypothesized that when ozone
   is administered to the isolated lung with a rapid shallow breathing
   pattern rather than a slow deep pattern, relatively less airway
   epithelial damage would occur. Four groups of isolated buffer perfused
   rat lungs were exposed to ozone (1 ppm) or to filtered air for 90 min
   with either a slow deep (SDB, tidal volume 2.4 mi, frequency 40
   breaths/min) or a rapid shallow breathing pattern (RSB, tidal volume 1.2
   ml, frequency 80 breaths/min), resulting in an equivalent inspired dose.
   The absorbed dose of ozone did not differ between the exposed groups.
   Ethidium homodimer-l was then instilled into the trachea to identify
   injured airway epithelial cells. The lungs were fixed, the airways were
   microdissected, and the airway epithelial cells were counterstained with
   YPRO-1 prior to evaluation with confocal microscopy. Ozone-induced
   airway epithelial cell injury occurred to a lesser overall degree when
   lungs were exposed by the RSB pattern (p = 0.003). The relative
   reduction in injury was greater (p < 0.05) in the proximal axial airway
   than in its adjacent airway branch and terminal bronchioles. Ozone
   induced an increase in pulmonary resistance with the SDB pattern but not
   with the RSB pattern. Thus, at an equivalent dose of inspired ozone, a
   RSB pattern resulted in less total damage than a SDB pattern and the
   distribution of protection was heterogeneous with proximal axial airways
   displaying the greatest relative reductions in epithelial damage, (C)

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial dysfunction and degeneration are associated with many
   neurodegenerative disorders. A dysfunctional mitochondrial electron
   transport chain (ETC) impairs ATP production and accelerates the
   generation of free radicals. To evaluate mitochondrial function,
   reliable methods are needed. Conventional spectrophotometric assays may
   not eliminate interference from nonspecific enzyme activities and do not
   measure quantities of specific ETC complexes. Blue native polyacrylamide
   gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) has been used to resolve mitochondrial ETC
   complexes. Combined with histochemical staining, it has also been
   applied to measure ETC enzyme activities in muscles. The current study
   is to determine (1) whether BN-PAGE can be used to detect ETC complexes
   from different regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and (2) the
   quantitative range of BN-PAGE in measuring the amounts and activities of
   different ETC complexes. By systematically varying the protein amount
   and the time of histochemical reactions, we have found linear ranges
   comparable to spectrophotometric assays for measuring enzyme activities
   of several ETC complexes. In addition, we found linear ranges for
   measuring protein quantities in several ETC complexes. These results
   demonstrate that BN-PAGE can be used to measure the amount and activity
   of the ETC enzymes from the nerve tissues and, thus, can be applied to
   evaluate the functional changes of mitochondria in neurodegenerative
   disorders. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   highly similar, with differences in the structures Idealized to the
   vicinity of residue 14 (X versus T), The pyrrole group of 1 is in the
   syn conformation and it,is displaced towards the major groove.
   Furthermore, unlike T14 in 2, the base of X14 has reduced pi-pi stacking
   interactions with C13 and C15 and the nitro group of X14 is pointing out
   of the major groove, The structures presented here establish the basis

   performed for different values of the parameters which are involved in
   the expression of the hole scattering rate. For reasonable values of the
   interaction parameters, the calculations show that the magnitude of the
   hole scattering rate is of the same order as observed experimentally and
   that it increases with decreasing hole doping. It is also found that the
   hole scattering rate depends on the energy omega like omega (m), where m
   changes gradually from m approximate to 2 to in = I with decreased
   doping level. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A two-level transient-state model has been developed which describes the
   effect of optical saturation on the photothermal signals, valid for

   general, as it considers arbitrary pulse shapes, homogeneously and
   inhomogeneously broadened lines, and arbitrary spectral profile of the
   excitation. Equations for the temporally and spatially dependent
   absorption coefficient are derived, and, for generality, time-dependent
   photothermal deflection signals in a flowing medium are calculated
   (stationary medium being just a special case). The saturation behaviors
   of the photothermal signals obtained by monochromatic rectangular and
   Q-switched pulse excitations for homogeneously and inhomogeneously
   broadened lines are evaluated and compared. Differences between the
   predictions of the steady-state and transient-state models are
   discussed. Experiments have been performed using NO2 as a sample gas in
   a flowing medium. The experimental results are in agreement with the

Abstract = {{Opossums are born in an immature, fetal-like state, making it possible
   to lesion their spinal cord early in development without intrauterine
   surgery. When the thoracic spinal cord of the North American opossum,
   Didelphis virginiana, is transected on postnatal day 5, and injections
   of Fast Blue (FB) are made caudal to the lesion site 30-40 days or 6
   months later, neurons are labeled in ail of the spinal and supraspinal
   areas that are labeled after comparable injections in age-matched,
   unlesioned controls. Double-labeling studies document that regeneration
   of cut axons contributes to growth of axons through the lesion site and
   behavioral studies show that animals lesioned on postnatal day 5 use
   their hindlimbs in normal appearing locomotion as adults. The critical
   period for developmental plasticity of descending spinal axons extends
   to postnatal day 26, although axons which grow through the lesion site
   become fewer in number and more restricted as to origin with increasing
   age. Animals lesioned between postnatal day 12 and 26 use the hindlimbs
   better than animals lesioned as adults, but hindlimb function is
   markedly abnormal and uncoordinated with that of the forelimbs, We
   conclude that restoration of anatomical continuity occurs after
   transection of the spinal cord in developing opossums, that descending
   axons grow through the lesion site, that regeneration of cut axons
   contributes to such growth, and that animals lesioned early enough in
   development have relatively normal motor function as adults. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Genetic and epigenetic alterations affecting proteins involved in
   apoptosis can contribute to the establishment and progression of cancer.
   Recently, our laboratory has isolated a novel gene, TMS1, that is
   aberrantly methylated and silenced in a significant proportion of human
   breast cancers. TMS1 contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD),
   suggesting a role in caspase-mediated cell death, In the present study,
   we characterize the participation or TMS1 in apoptosis and examine the
   subcellular localization of the protein. Inducible expression of TMS1
   inhibited cellular proliferation and induced DNA fragmentation in a
   time-dependent manner, These apoptotic events were blocked by the
   general caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, The ability of TMS1 to trigger
   apoptosis was also suppressed by a dominant negative form of caspase-9
   but not by a dominant negative form of caspase-8, indicating that TMS1
   functions through activation of caspase-9, Unlike a number of other
   CARD-containing proteins, TMS1 did not activate nuclear factor
   kappaB-dependent transcription, consistent with a proapoptotic role for
   TMS1 in death signaling pathways. Timed localization studies revealed
   that TMS1-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the redistribution of
   TMS1 from the cytoplasm to perinuclear spherical structures. Whereas the
   apoptotic activity of TMS1 was blocked by caspase inhibition, the
   formation of TMS1-containing subcellular structures was not, suggesting
   that the redistribution of TMS1 precedes caspase activation. Both the
   proapoptotic activity of TMS1 and aggregate formation were dependent on
   the CARD. Tn summary, the data indicate that TMS1-induced apoptosis
   proceeds through a CARD-dependent aggregation step followed by
   activation of a caspase-9-mediated pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Arthrofactin (AF) and surfactin (SF) are the most effective cyclic
   lipopeptide biosurfactants ever reported. Linear AF and linear SF were
   prepared by saponification of lactone ring. The oil displacement
   activities decreased to one third of their respective original values.
   When residues of both an aspartic acid and a glutamic acid of SF were
   methylated or amidated, the activity increased by 20\%, although their
   water solubility was lost. When these amino acid residues were modified
   by aminomethane sulfonic acid, the activity was drastically decreased
   probably owing to charge repulsion and structural distortion inhibiting
   micelle formation. Both AF and SF expressed higher activity under
   alkaline conditions than acidic conditions. AF was more resistant to
   acidic conditions than SF and it kept high activity even under pH 0.5.
   Although SF drastically reduced its activity under acidic conditions,
   surfactin-Asp/Glu-amido ester and snrfactin-Asp/Glu-methyl ester
   retained similar activities irrespective of the pH change. A couple of
   conformers of SF prepared by reverse-phase HPLC showed the same oil
   displacement activity but different surface tension-reducing activity.
   AF was produced as a series of different fatty acid chain lengths (from
   C8 to C12). Among them, AF with fatty acid chain length of C10, which
   was the main product of the strain, showed the highest activity. (C)

Pages = {{1360-1362}},

Abstract = {{Background. There is no defined lower acceptable level of glomerular
   filtration rate (GFR) in potential living kidney donors. Considerations
   focus on the risk for the donor. We wanted to evaluate the outcome in
   the recipient in relation to the GFR of the living donor.
   Methods. There were 344 living donated kidney transplantations performed
   January 1985 through February 1997 which were evaluated. Two thirds of
   the donors shared one haplotype with the recipient and 15\% shared both.
   Of the donors 18\% were above age 60. The median follow-up time (until
   graft loss) was 63 months. Before nephrectomy, the donors' GFR had been
   measured by isotope clearance.
   Results. Twenty-six donors (7.6\%) had an absolute GFR below 80 mi/min,
   i,e, not adjusted to 1.73 me body surface area (ESA). Cumulative graft
   survival, censored for graft loss because of death of the patient, was
   significantly reduced in recipients of grafts from donors with GFR <80
   ml/min. A significant correlation between GFR and donor age was
   observed, but donor age per se was not identified as a risk factor for
   graft loss. In a Cox stepwise proportional hazards analysis, the
   relative risk for graft loss was 2.28 with a GFR below 80 mi/min
   (confidence interval 1,183-4.383, P = 0.014) and with sharing;one or
   both haplotypes 0.56 (0.313-0.988, P = 0.046) and 0.36 (0.139-0.912, P =
   0.03), respectively.
   Conclusions. An absolute GFR below 80 mi/min in the living donor more
   than doubles the risk of graft loss. This bet should be considered when
   definitions of acceptable limits for donor GFR are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated two genetic polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor
   locus (TNF-alpha -308 G-->A and LT-alpha +252 A-->G) as risk factors for
   coronary atherothrombotic disease (CAD) by determining its prevalence in
   148 survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) with angiographically-proven
   severe CAD, and in 148 age-, gender- and race-matched controls. The odds
   ratio (OR) for MI related to the mutant TNF-alpha and LT-alpha alleles
   was 0.8 (CI95: 0.4-1.3) and 1.3 (CI95: 0.8-2.0), respectively. We also
   sought interaction of smoking and metabolic risk factors for MI with
   each mutant genotype. Smokers not carrying the LT-alpha +252 A-->G
   mutation had a risk of MI of 2.7 (CI95: 1.4-5.4) whereas in smoking
   carriers the risk was 6.9 (CI95: 3.4-14.1). An interactive effect of the
   LT-a mutation may also exist with dyslipidemia (OR for MI in
   non-carriers was 12 {[}CI95: 3.2-41.3] and in carriers the OR was 39,
   {[}CI95: 5.1-301] and with obesity (OR for MI was 2.7, {[}CI95: 1-7.2]
   in non-carriers and in carriers the OR was 6 {[}CI95: 2.1-16.8]).
   Lastly, the OR for MI in obese non-carriers of TNF-alpha -308 G-->A was
   2.8 (CI95: 1.3-6) and in obese carriers the OR was 14.5 (CI95: 1.8-113).
   Although significant interactive effects could not be detected, the
   findings suggest that interaction of polymorphisms in the TNF locus with
   major risk factors for CAD may exist, and should be explored in larger
   studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite intensive research the atomistic reaction path leading to the
   dissociative adsorption of hydrogen molecules on a Si(001) substrate is
   still debated. In this paper density-functional calculations employing a
   generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation
   functional will be presented for the interdimer reaction paths on both
   clean and H-precovered Si(001) surfaces. It turns out that silicon
   surface dimers with one of their two dangling bonds saturated with a
   hydrogen atom result in very reactive H-2-adsorption sites. The high
   reactivity is explained to be due to dangling-bond states close to the
   Fermi level, which can very efficiently hybridize with the antibonding
   1s Sigma (u){*} state of the H-2 molecule. This is analogous to the high
   reactivity of step sites on Si(001) vicinal surfaces discussed by
   Kratzer et nl. On the clean surface the calculations produce an
   adsorption-energy barrier for the interdimer reaction path which is even
   slightly smaller than the respective barrier for the common intradimer
   reaction path. Thus, provided its prefactor is not too small, the
   interdimer reaction path might be relevant for the sticking of H-2 on
   Si(001).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON}},
Year = {{2000}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{189-203}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{1. Cat ventricular myocytes loaded with {[}Ca2+](i)- and pH(i)-sensitive
   probes were used to examine the subcellular mechanism(s) of the Ang
   II-induced positive inotropic effect. Ang II (1 muM) produced parallel
   increases in contraction and Ca2+ transient amplitudes and a slowly
   developing intracellular alkalisation. Maximal increases in contraction
   amplitude and Ca2+ transient amplitude were 163 +/- 22 and 43 +/- 8\%,
   respectively, and occurred between 5 and 7 min after Ang II
   administration, whereas pH(i) increase (0.06 +/- 0.03 pH units) became
   significant only 15 min after the addition of Ang II. Furthermore, the
   inotropic effect of Ang II was preserved in the presence of Na+-H+
   exchanger blockade. These results indicate that the positive inotropic
   effect of Ang II is independent of changes in pHi.
   2. Similar increases in contractility produced by either elevating
   extracellular {[}Ca2+] or by Ang II application produced similar
   increases in peak systolic Ca2+ indicating; that an increase in
   myofilament responsiveness to Ca2+ does not participate in the Ang II
   induced positive inotropic effect.
   3. Ang II significantly increased the L-type Ca2+ current, as assessed
   by using the perforated patch-clamp technique (peak current recorded at
   0 mV: -1.88 +/- 0.16 pA pF(-1) in control vs. -3.03 +/- 0.20 pA pF(-1)
   after 6-8 min of administration of Ang II to the bath solution).
   4. The positive inotropic effect of Ang II was not modified in the
   presence of either KB-R7943, a specific blocker of the Na+-Ca2+
   exchanger, or ryanodine plus thapsigargin, used to block the
   sarcoplasmic reticulum function.
   5. The above results allow us to conclude that in the cat ventricle the
   Ang II-induced positive inotropic effect is due to an increase in the
   intracellular Ca2+ transient, an enhancement of the L-type Ca2+ current
   being the dominant mechanism underlying this increase.}},

Abstract = {{Isothermal crystallization from the glassy state of oriented isotactic
   polystyrene (iPS) was studied using in situ Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) spectroscopy and in situ wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD)
   studies. The oriented amorphous films of iPS were prepared by rolling
   the amorphous iPS film to a draw ratio of 3 or 4. In situ FTIR was used
   to investigate the ordering process of polymer chains prior to
   crystallization by measuring the change in the dichroic ratio with time,
   while in situ WAXD studies were used to investigate the development of
   the crystalline structure. The studies showed that the orientation
   process and the conformation change preceded crystallization. This
   observation suggests that polystyrene chains undergo an ordering process
   during the induction period of crystallization. The degree of
   orientation markedly increases with time in the induction period,
   suggesting that heat treatment of oriented amorphous materials under
   constraint provides a useful method for processing highly oriented
   materials. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA may generate many distinct proteins
   from a single gene: regulation of alternative exon selection constitutes
   control of molecular structure downstream of transcription. Identifying
   natural splice variants among hundreds or thousands of theoretical
   alternatives, and examining the regulation of exon selection at multiple
   sites, may require screening many full-length cDNAs. We describe methods
   for preparing full-length cDNA libraries comprising the splice variants
   from single genes. The methods employ robust long distance reverse
   transcription, gene-specific second strand synthesis, long PCR, and
   cloning: with these methods cDNAs coding full-length open reading frames
   were prepared for 21 ion channels (1.2-15 kb), Exon combinations in
   isolated clones are determined by multiplex PCR. Approximately 85\% of
   the clones contain full-length inserts. Screening can detect even rare
   variants (0.1\%) in linear proportion to their abundance in initial mRNA
   pools, Tissue-specific expression patterns are reproducible, We describe
   methods for quantifying and minimizing artifactual exon recombination by
   template switching, These methods can be used to generate thousands of

Abstract = {{Tissue factor (TF) is the cellular receptor for factor FVIIa (FVIIa),
   and the complex is the principal initiator of blood coagulation. The
   effects of FVIIa binding to TF on cell migration and signal transduction
   of human fibroblasts, which express high amounts of TF, were studied.
   Fibroblasts incubated with FVIIa migrated toward a concentration
   gradient of PDGF-BB at approximately 100 times lower concentration than
   do fibroblasts not ligated with FVIIa. Anti-TF antibodies inhibited the
   crease in chemotaxis induced by FVIIa/TF. Moreover, a pronounced
   suppression of chemotaxis induced by PDGF-BB was observed with active
   site-inhibited FVIIa (FFR-FVIIa). The possibility that hyperchemotaxis
   was induced by a putative generation of FXa and thrombin activity was
   excluded. FVIIa/TF did not induce increased levels of PDGF beta
   -receptors on the cell surface. Thus, the hyperchemotaxis was not a
   result of this mechanism. FVIIa induced the production of
   inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate to the same extent as PDGF-BB; the effects
   of FVIIa and PDGF-BB were additive. FFR-FVIIa did not induce any release
   of inositol-1,4,5,-trisphosphate. Thus, binding of catalytically active
   FVIIa to TF can, independent of coagulation, modulate cellular
   responses, such as chemotaxis. (C) 2000 by The American Society of

Abstract = {{The optical-absorption spectrum of a cationic Ag-0 atom in a KCI crystal
   has been studied theoretically by means of a series of cluster models of
   increasing size. Excitation energies have been determined by means of a
   multiconfigurational self-consistent field procedure followed by a
   second-order perturbation correlation treatment. Moreover results
   obtained within the density-functional framework are also reported. The
   calculations confirm the assignment of bands I and TV to transitions of
   the Ag-Ss electron into delocalized states with mainly K-4s,4p
   character. Bands II and III have been assigned to internal transitions
   on the Ag atom, which correspond to the atomic Ag-4d to Ag-Ss
   transition. We also determine the lowest charge transfer (CT) excitation
   energy and confirm the assignment of band VI to such a transition. The
   study of the variation of the CT excitation energy with the Ap-Cl
   distance R gives additional support to a large displacement of the Cl
   ions due to the presence of the Ag-0 impurity. Moreover, from the
   present results, it is predicted that on passing to NaCl:Ag-0 the CT
   onset would be out of the optical range while the 5s-5p transition would
   undergo a redshift of 0.3 eV. These conclusions, which underline the
   different character of involved orbitals, are consistent with
   experimental findings. The existence of a CT transition in the optical
   range for an atom inside an ionic host is explained by a simple model,
   which also accounts for the differences with the more common 3d systems.
   The present study sheds also some light on the R dependence of the
   s(2)-sp transitions due to s(2) ions like Ti+.}},

Abstract = {{A global three-dimensional primitive equation general circulation model
   is used to estimate the upper ocean heat budget and subduction rates in
   the eastern North Atlantic during the period of the Subduction
   Experiment, June 1991 through July 1993. The seasonal cycle is dominated
   by one-dimensional processes throughout the subtropical gyre, i.e., a
   local balance between the net heat flux into the ocean through the
   surface and a vertical redistribution due to vertical mixing. However,
   closure of the heat budget on long timescales involves redistribution by
   Ekman transports (both horizonal and vertical), geostrophic advection,
   and vertical diffusion. Subgridscale parameterizations of eddy processes
   weakly restratify the upper ocean. The annual rate at which waters are
   subducted from the mixed layer into the permanent thermocline is
   estimated using both kinematic and thermodynamic methods. These
   subduction rates and patterns are generally consistent with each other
   and also with previous estimates of the large scale subduction rate
   based on climatologies and models. Consideration of a finite thickness
   Ekman layer is shown to reduce the thermodynamic estimate of the
   subduction rate at low latitudes by O(50\%), in much better agreement
   with the kinematic method. The effects of convergent eddy fluxes in the
   mixed layer and a diabatic thermocline on the subduction rate are also
   calculated and found to be small but not negligible. The seasonal and
   interannual evolution of the sea surface temperature and mixed layer
   depth in the model compare well with in situ measurements at five
   mooring locations taken as part of the Subduction Experiment. These
   results demonstrate that a global, low-resolution general circulation
   model forced with surface fluxes of heat and freshwater can accurately
   reproduce the evolution of the upper ocean thermal structure and provide
   a useful tool for the analysis of air-sea interaction and climate
   variability on seasonal to interannual timescales.}},

   and found to each have 78\% amino acid sequence identity with tomato
   Pti1, Glutathione S-transferase fusions of sPti1a and b expressed in

Abstract = {{The study of drug metabolism in cultured rat hepatocytes is hampered by
   the rapid loss of the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes.
   Nevertheless, the activity of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), one of the
   most important isoenzymes for drug metabolism, can be elevated by
   chemical inducers. In the present study, we investigated in cultured rat
   hepatocytes the induction of all four currently identified CYP3A
   isoforms by dexamethasone, and compared the results obtained in vitro
   with the induction profile of dexamethasone in vivo. To this end, CYP3A
   mRNA levels were quantified with a never, radioactive reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and CYP3A
   enzymatic activity was measured by a testosterone hydroxylation assay.
   In the RT-PCR assay, CYP3A isoforms were co-amplified with
   glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the presence of
   radioactively labeled nucleotides. This resulted in an extremely
   sensitive and accurate determination of CYP3A expression levels,
   relative to those of GAPDH. Using this RT-PCR assay, it was found that
   the expression of all CYP3A isoforms in rat hepatocytes, cultured on a
   collagen matrix, was decreased by 80-90\% within one day of cultivation.
   After addition of dexamethasone, at one day after isolation, CYP3A1 mRNA
   levels were elevated to levels comparable to those in freshly isolated
   hepatocytes within two days. In contrast, CYP3A2, CYP3A9, and CYP3A18
   mRNA levels were not affected by dexamethasone treatment, and were
   hardly detectable after three days of cultivation. CYP3A enzymatic
   activity was also induced in cultured hepatocytes (approximately 6-fold)
   after addition of dexamethasone. In vivo, CYP3A1 mRNA levels increased
   45-fold after dexamethasone administration. However, in contrast to the
   situation in cultured hepatocytes, CYP3A2 and CYP3A18 were also induced,
   albeit to a lesser extent (4- and I-fold elevated mRNA levels,
   respectively). We conclude that the selective induction of CYP3A1 in
   dexamethasone-treated rat hepatocytes allows the study of
   biotransformation reactions by CYP3A1, without interference by any of
   the other CYP3A isoenzymes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Three great earthquakes with magnitude greater than 8 have struck the
   Himalayan belt within a span of 50 years, and the 1905 Kangra earthquake
   is one of them. The seismotectonics of the meizoseismal region of this
   earthquake in the Kangra-Chamba region are analyzed on the basis of the
   major structures and the present day seismic activity. The
   microseismicity recorded by a network of 12 stations for a period of 16
   months spanning 4 years (1993-1996) shows the activity is mainly
   concentrated over the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) and Panjal Thrust (PT)
   zones and the Chamba Nappe region. A NE-SW Vertical section reveals that
   the majority of events are concentrated within a depth range of 5 to 18
   km, and the majority of the foci lie between 12 and 18 km. The base of
   the microseismicity zone is interpreted as representing a contact or a
   decollement plane between the top of the Indian plate and the Himalayan
   rock formations. This decollement plane is interpreted as the northern
   continuation of the detachment observed in the sub-Himalaya in
   reflection profile. The southward propagation of the Chamba Nappe, as
   well as the PT and MBT zones, over the detachment causes accumulation of
   strain energy in this region. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of four sulfated polyvinyl alcohol-acrylate copolymers and
   heparin on plasminogen activation and on plasmin activity is studied.
   The molecules differing in charge (proportion of negatively charged
   units 40.5\%-73.5\% of the total) and in size (5600 Da-8800 Da)
   accelerate plasminogen activation by 2-up to 4-fold at a 7-fold molar
   excess of the polyvinylacrylates over plasminogen, They, however, exert
   a concentration and charge-dependent effect on plasmin: both the
   amidolytic (half-maximal effect at a 1.33-3.66 molar excess of the
   polyvinylacrylates) and fibrinolytic (half-maximal effect at 1.23-1.72
   molar excess of the polyvinylacrylates) activities of plasmin are
   inhibited. In contrast, heparin (a similarly carboxylated and sulfated
   polymer) and polyvinylacrylates with a low number of sulfate groups
   (30\% sulfated monomers) at concentrations up to 2.2 muM do not affect
   plasminogen activation and plasmin activity in a milieu of physiological
   ionic strength. Experiments with plasmin derivatives lacking N-terminal
   peptides of different length (des-kringle(1-4) and des-kringlel(1-5)
   plasmin) show identical changes in the protease activities, precluding
   involvement of the kringle-domain in the interaction with the
   polyvinylacrylates. Fluorescence studies evidence the charge-dependent
   binding of the polyvinylacrylates to plasmin, but not to plasminogen.
   Thus, through non-covalent interaction with the protease-domain of
   plasmin the polyvinylacrylates inhibit fibrinolysis. Since these
   sulfated copolymers inhibit both thrombin {[}4] and plasmin activity,
   they may be a useful therapeutic tool in situations when both the blood
   coagulation and the fibrinolytic system are activated (such as
   intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis, ICF). (C) 2000 Elsevier

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2000}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{We study the real-time nonequilibrium dynamics in hot QED plasmas
   implementing a dynamical renormalization group and using the hard
   thermal loop (HTL) approximation. The focus is on the study of the
   relaxation of gauge and fermionic mean fields and on the quantum
   kinetics of the photon and fermion distribution functions. For semihard
   photons of momentum eT much less thank much less thanT we find to
   leading order in the HTL that the gauge mean field relaxes in time with
   a power law as a result of infrared enhancement of the spectral density
   near the Landau damping threshold. The distribution function of semihard
   photons in linear response also relaxes with a power law, with a power
   that is twice that for the mean field. The dynamical renormalization
   group reveals the emergence of detailed balance for microscopic time
   scales larger than Ilk while the rates are still varying with time. The
   quantum kinetic equation for the photon distribution function allows us
   to study photon production from a thermalized quark-gluon plasma (QGP)
   by off-shell effects. We find that for a QGP of temperature T similar to
   200 MeV and lifetime 10 less than or similar tot less than or similar to
   50 fm/c the hard (k similar toT) photon production from off-shell
   bremsstrahlung (q-->q gamma and (q) over bar-->(q) over bar gamma) at
   O(alpha) grows logarithmically in time and is comparable to that
   produced from on-shell Compton scattering and pair annihilation at
   O(alpha alpha (s)). Hard fermion mean fields relax as e(-alpha Tt
   ln(omega pt)) with omegap=eT/3 the plasma frequency, as a consequence of
   the emission and absorption of soft magnetic photons. A quantum kinetic
   equation for hard fermions is obtained directly in real time from a
   field theoretical approach improved by the dynamical renormalization
   group, The collision kernel is time-dependent and infrared finite. In
   linear response the fermion distribution function relaxes with an
   anomalous exponential law with an exponent twice as large as that for
   the mean field.}},

Abstract = {{Styrene is an industrial solvent which is mainly oxidized by cytochrome
   P450 to an electrophilic, chiral epoxide metabolite: styrene-7,8-oxide
   (SO). SO has cytotoxic and genotoxic properties; the (R)-enantiomer is
   more mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 in the Ames test than
   the (S)-enantiomer. Detoxication proceeds via microsomal epoxide
   hydrolase (mEH). Interindividual differences in mEH activity as well as
   differences in mEH enantioselectivity are important factors for toxic
   effects of SO. To study the extent of the interindividual variation,
   microsomal preparations of 20 human livers were incubated with (R)- and
   (S)-SO separately (1-2000 muM) and Michaelis-Menten kinetics were
   determined. In addition, samples were genotyped for two genetic
   polymorphisms of the mEH gene. V-max, K-m and V-max/K-m values of both
   enantiomers differed three- to fivefold between the livers. No
   association of the enzyme constants with the genetic polymorphisms of
   the epoxide hydrolase gene was found. Hydrolysis of the styrene oxide
   enantiomers proceeded in an enantioselective manner, with the
   (S)-enantiomer having an approximately six times higher K-m and five
   times higher V-max than the (R)-enantiamer. In vivo, both SO enantiomers
   are formed; therefore, time course incubations with racemic SO were
   carried out in vitro to investigate possible interactions between the
   enantiomers. When racemic SO was used as a substrate, the (R)-enantiomer
   acted as an inhibitor on the hydrolysis of the (S)-enantiomer. These
   results indicate that mEH-mediated hydrolysis of SO is subject to
   appreciable interindividual variation and that hydrolysis of the more
   toxic enantiomer is favored. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. The electromyogram of the L1-L7 multifidus muscles of the
   in vivo cat were recorded while applying a prolonged steady displacement
   to the lumbar spine through the L4-L5 supraspinous ligament, simulating
   a moderate anterior flexion.
   Objective. To demonstrate that tension-relaxation and laxity of the
   viscoelastic structures (ligaments, discs, and capsules) induced by
   prolonged static flexion of the spine, results in loss of reflexive
   muscular stabilizing activity and in muscular disorders that may lead to
   or are associated with low back pain.
   Summary of Background. Epidemiologic data show that prolonged loading of
   the spine, such as in some occupational activities, can cause low back
   pain and muscle spasms. Direct experimental evidence linking prolonged
   loading to decrease in spinal stability, low back pain, and muscle
   spasms was not found. It was hypothesized, however, that
   mechanoreceptors in the viscoelastic structures,when strained,
   reflexively activate the multifidus muscles to maintain intervertebral
   stability; that the reflexive muscular activity decreases with
   stress-relaxation and laxity in the viscoelastic structures; and that
   when severe strain and possible damage of the viscoelastic structures
   occurs with time, nociceptive receptors elicit spasms in the musculature
   and possible pain.
   Methods. The lumbar spine of seven in vivo cat preparations was
   displaced through the L4-L5 supraspinous ligament into moderate flexion
   that was steadily maintained for so minutes while intramuscular
   electromyograms were recorded from each of the multifidus muscles of
   L1-L2 through L6-L7. Load and electromyogram were continuously monitored
   and recorded. Five additional preparations were used as controls, in
   which dissection and recordings were identical, but the lumbar flexion
   was excluded.
   Results. Prolonged flexion of the lumbar spine resulted muscles that
   decreased to approximately 5\% of its initial reflexive electromyogram
   from the multi:initially as tension-relaxation began in the viscoelastic
   structures within the first 3 minutes, after which, random and
   unpredictable electromyogram discharges (i.e., spasms) of high amplitude
   were recorded from different levels. In some preparations the spasms
   were present in L1-L4, and in others in all the levels. In other
   preparations the spasms were recorded only at L5 and L6. The onset of
   the spasms was also unpredictable, because they were initiated in some
   cases within 2-3 minutes after the spine was loaded. In other cases, the
   spasms were observed anytime during the test period and up to 20 minutes
   after the. the load was removed. Spasms were also observed in the
   spinalis and longissimus muscles.
   Conclusions. Prolonged flexion of the lumbar spine results in
   tension-relaxation and laxity of its viscoelastic structures, loss of
   reflexive muscular activity within 3 minutes and electromyogram spasms
   in the multifidus and other posterior muscles.}},

Abstract = {{Using a database of 440 molecules, we develop a set of effective solvent
   descriptors that characterize the organic carbon component of soil and
   thereby allow quantum mechanical SM5 universal solvation models to be
   applied to partitioning of solutes between soil and air. Combining this
   set of effective solvent descriptors with solute atomic surface tension
   parameters already developed for water/air and organic solvent/air
   partitioning allows one to predict the partitioning of any solutes
   composed of H, C, N, O, F, P, S, Ci, Br, and I between soil and water.
   We also present linear correlations of soil/water partitioning with
   1-octanol/water partition coefficients using the same database. The
   quantum mechanical calculations have the advantages that they require no
   experimental input and should be robust for a wide range of solute
   functionality. The quantitative effective solvent descriptors can be
   used for a better understanding (than with previously available models)
   of the sources of different partitioning phenomena in cases where the
   results exhibit significant fragment interactions. We anticipate that
   the model will be useful for understanding the partitioning of organic
   chemicals in the environment between water and soil or, more generally,
   between water and soil or sediments (geosorbents).}},

Abstract = {{Arsenic compounds are potent human carcinogens. Accumulated evidence has
   shown that arsenite-induced cytogenetic alterations are associated with
   the carcinogenicity of arsenic. Because p53 plays a guarding role in
   maintaining genome integrity acid accuracy of chromosome segregation,
   the mechanistic effects of arsenite on p53 activation were analyzed. In
   the present study, arsenite-induced DNA strand breaks were confirmed by
   alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) in human
   fibroblast (HFW) cells. Accompanying the appearance of DNA strand breaks
   was a significant accumulation of p53 in arsenite-treated HFW cells, as
   demonstrated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence techniques, p53
   downstream proteins, such as p21 and the human homologue of murine
   double minute-2, were also significantly induced by arsenite treatment.
   Cell cycle retardation and G(2)-M arrest were observed in
   5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine pulse-labeled HFW cells by flow cytometry,
   Wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, inhibited
   arsenite- or X-ray irradiation-induced p53 accumulation but did not
   alter UV irradiation- or N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal-induced p53
   accumulation. p53 phosphorylation on serine 15 was also confirmed by
   immunoblotting technique in arsenite- and X-ray-treated HFW cells but
   was not observed in UV- or N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal-treated HFW
   cells, These results suggest the involvement of a phosphatidylinositol
   3-kinase-related protein kinase in arsenite-induced p53 accumulation.
   For confirmation, we demonstrated that arsenite treatment, similar to
   X-ray irradiation, did not induce p53 accumulation in GM3395 fibroblasts
   derived from a patient with ataxia telangiectasia. In contrast, UV
   irradiation did cause p53 accumulation in these cells. Together, these
   findings infer that arsenite-induced DNA strand breaks may lead to p53
   phosphorylation and accumulation through an ataxia telangiectasia
   mutated-dependent pathway in HFW cells.}},

Abstract = {{The peptide hormone angiotensin II regulates a variety of physiological
   responses which are mediated by its interaction with high affinity G
   protein-coupled receptors localized on the surface of target cells. To
   gain insights into the transcriptional regulation of the human
   angiotensin II type 1 receptor (hAT(1)R) gene, we have isolated 1 kb of
   the 5'-flanking sequence of this gene. Expression constructs containing
   various 5'-deletions of the hAT(1)R promoter region, fused upstream to
   the luciferase reporter gene, were transiently transfected into H295-R,
   HEC-1B and A549 cells. It was demonstrated that a 145 bp sequence within
   the promoter region was required for basal level expression of the
   hAT(1)R gene in all of the three cell lines investigated. Computer
   analysis indicated the existence of numerous putative transcription
   factor binding sites in this region. Further detailed deletion data
   suggested essential transcription factor binding sites between -98 and
   -79 bp. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that four
   protein-DNA complexes were formed within the -98 to -79 bp region of the
   hAT1R gene when incubated with H295-R cell nuclear extract.
   Site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that a putative Spl binding
   site was critical for the basal level expression of the hAT(1)R gene.

Abstract = {{We compared the spike activity of individual neurons in the Aplysia
   abdominal ganglion with the movement of the gill during the
   gill-withdrawal reflex. We discriminated four populations that
   collectively encompass approximately half of the active neurons in the
   ganglion: (1) second-order sensory neurons that respond to the onset and
   offset of stimulation of the gill and are active before the movement
   starts; (2) neurons whose activity is correlated with the position of
   the gill and typically have a tonic output during gill withdrawal; (3)
   neurons whose activity is correlated with the velocity of the movement
   and typically fire in a phasic manner; and (4) neurons whose activity is
   correlated with both position and velocity. A reliable prediction of the
   position of the gill is achieved only with the combined output of 15-20
   neurons, whereas a reliable prediction of the velocity depends on the
   combined output of 40 or more cells.}},

Abstract = {{Tetrahydropterins are obligatory cofactors for tyrosine hydroxylase
   (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis. A series
   of synthetic analogues of 6(R)-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin
   (BH4) with different substituents in positions C2, N3, C4, N5, C6, C7,
   and N8 on the ring were used as active site probes for recombinant human
   TH. The enzyme tolerates rather bulky substituents at C6, as seen by the
   catalytic efficiency (V-max/K-m) and the couplings efficiency (mol of
   L-DOPA produced/mol of tetrahydropterin oxidized) of the cofactors.
   Substitutions at C2, C4, N5, and Ns abolish the cofactor activity of the
   pterin analogues. Molecular docking of BH4 into the crystal structure of
   the catalytic domain of ligand-free rat TH results in complexes in which
   the pteridine ring pi -stacks with Phe300 and the N3 and the amino group
   at C2 hydrogen bonds with Glu332. The pteridine ring also establishes
   interactions with Leu294 and Gln310. The distance between C4a in the
   pteridines and the active site iron was 4.2 +/- 0.5 Angstrom for the
   ensemble of docked conformers. Docking of BH4 analogues into TH also
   shows that the most bulky substituents at C6 can be well-accommodated
   within the large hydrophobic pocket surrounded by Ala297, Ser368,
   Tyr371, and Trp372, without altering the positioning of the ring. The
   pterin ring of 7-BH4 shows proper stacking with Phe300, but the distance
   between the C4a and the active site iron is 0.6 Angstrom longer than for
   bound BH4, a finding that may be related to the high degree of
   uncoupling observed for 7-BH4.}},

Abstract = {{Micellar rate effects on hydrolyses of substituted benzoyl chlorides, 1,
   depend on headgroup charge and electron donation or withdrawal by
   substituents. Micellized sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS, inhibits
   hydrolyses, and first-order rate constants in the micellar pseudophase,
   k'(M), decrease, relative to those in water, k'(W), over a range of ca.
   10, but in cetyl trimethylammonium chloride, CTACl, k'(M)/k'(W) > 1 for
   hydrolyses of 1,3,5-(NO2)(2) and 1, 4-NO2, and decreases steeply with
   electron-donating substituents in the following sequence: 1,4-Cl
   approximate to 4-Br > 4-H > 4-Me > 4-OMe, over a range of > 10(3). Cetyl
   trimethylammonium bromide and mesylate behave like CTACl. Fits to the
   Hammett equation give rho approximate to 1 in SDS and rho approximate to
   4 in CTACl. Anionic micelles have higher interfacial polarities than
   cationic micelles, but micellar and solvent effects do not correspond
   because over a range of solvents, H2O to H2O-MeCN, 1:1 w/w plots of log
   k'(W) against sigma go through minima with positive rho for 1,
   3,5-(NO2)(2), and 4-NO2 and negative for the other substrates. The
   micellar effects correspond to differing extents of bond-making and
   -breaking in the transition state. Values of k(+)/k(-) (rate constants
   in CTACl and SDS) decrease strongly with increasing electron donation by
   substituents. Micellar rate effects in hydrolyses of benzyl bromide and
   4-methoxybenzyl chloride are similar to those with the benzoyl
   chlorides. Although data were analyzed by a pseudophase treatment,
   application of transition state theory and reported micellar surface
   potentials allows estimation of local charge at the reaction center for
   hydrolyses of the benzoyl chlorides.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the kinetics of the solubilization of oil through a
   temperature jump into a droplet microemulsion phase in the system
   water-pentaethylene oxide dodecyl ether-decane at 25 degreesC. The
   initial state is formed by subjecting the equilibrium system at 25
   degreesC to a temperature quench to 22, 20, and 14 degreesC,
   respectively. At this lower temperature, which at equilibrium
   corresponds to a two-phase system, oil droplets form and grow in size
   with increasing time. By varying the time between the quench and the
   T-jump, the size of the initial oil drops is varied in a systematic and
   known way in the relaxation study. The relaxation process is monitored
   by following the turbidity of the system. We find that for all the
   systems the relaxation back to equlibrium is much faster than the drop
   growth process observed after the temperature quench. This general
   observation is explained by realizing that the redissolution of the oil
   drops is analogous to the oil transfer phase, which in the quench
   experiment occurs prior to the Ostwald ripening phase. More significant
   is that we observed a qualitative transition in the relaxation behavior
   when the initial aggregate distribution is varied. In all cases we have
   the same initial temperature and overall composition and one population
   of many small droplets and fewer larger drops. The size of the larger
   drops only affects the relaxation in a quantitative way. if the small
   droplets are only slightly smaller than the equilibrium size,
   equilibration occurs through the diffusion of oil molecules in the bulk
   phase. When the initial droplets are sufficiently small, a new kinetic
   route is available where there is an efficient direct oil transfer
   between the small droplets and large drops. This allows for a fast
   relaxation of the oil distribution between the two populations of drops.}},

Abstract = {{The dissolution of poly(alpha -methylstyrene) (PAMS) by a binary solvent

   From each sequential image in a timed sequence, spatially resolved
   spectral data were gathered and absorbance profiles for the field of
   view were obtained. This allowed the study of solvent penetration and
   quantitative analysis of the dissolution process from concentration
   profiles. The dissolution of the polymer was found to vary linearly with
   time for similar to 150 mum dissolved layer. The dissolution rate was
   found to increase linearly with MIBK concentration. In each solvent
   mixture, diffusion profiles were characteristic of case LI diffusion. No
   solvent component segregation was seen. It is demonstrated that PT-IR

Title = {{Protonation state of methyltetrahydrofolate in a binary complex with
   cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase}},

Pages = {{13880-13890}},

Abstract = {{N5 -Methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3 -H(4)folate) donates a methyl group to
   the cob(I)alamin cofactor in the reaction catalyzed by
   cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MetH, EC 2.1.1.3). Nucleophilic
   displacement of a methyl group attached to a tertiary amine is a
   reaction without an obvious precedent in bioorganic chemistry.
   Activation of CH3-H(4)folate by protonation prior to transfer of the
   methyl group has been the favored mechanism. Protonation at N5 would
   lead to formation of an aminium cation, and quaternary amines such as
   5,5-dimethyltetrahydropterin have been shown to transfer methyl groups
   to cob(I)alamin. Because CH3-H(4)folate is an enamine, protonation could
   occur either at N5 to form an aminium cation or on a conjugated carbon
   with formation of an iminium cation. We used C-13 distortionless
   enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) NMR spectroscopy to infer
   that CH3-H4folate in aqueous solution protonates at N5, not on carbon.
   CH3-H(4)folate must eventually protonate at N5 to form the product
   H(4)folate; however, this protonation could occur either upon formation
   of the binary enzyme-CH3-H-4-folate complex or later in the reaction
   mechanism. Protonation at N5 is accompanied by substantial changes in
   the visible absorbance spectrum of CH3-H(4)folate. We have measured the
   spectral changes associated with binding of CH3-H4folate to a
   catalytically competent fragment of MetH over the pH range from 5.5 to
   8.5. These studies indicate that CH3-H4folate is bound in the
   unprotonated form throughout this pH range and that protonated
   CH3-H(4)folate does not bind to the enzyme. Our observations are
   rationalized by sequence homologies between the folate-binding region of
   MetH and dihydropteroate synthase, which suggest that the pterin ring is
   bound in the hydrophobic core of an alpha (8)beta (8) barrel in both
   enzymes. The results from these studies are difficult to reconcile with
   an S(N)2 mechanism for methyl transfer and suggest that the presence of
   the cobalamin cofactor is important for CH3-H(4)folate activation. We
   propose that protonation of N5 occurs after carbon-nitrogen bond
   cleavage, and we invoke a mechanism involving oxidative addition of Co1+
   to the N5-methyl bond to rationalize our results.}},

   and the properties of the grafted films were investigated. Compared with
   the conventional EVA-grafted hydrophilic monomer, the EVA films grafted
   with HEMA and St have superior antithrombogenicity; the
   antithrombogenicity and permeability of EVA-g-(HEMA-co-St) were 30 and

Abstract = {{Background: In the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, in
   contrast to the recommendations of the American College of Chest
   Physicians and the American Heart Association, the US Food and Drug
   Administration recently stated that there was insufficient evidence to
   judge whether aspirin therapy decreases the risk of a first myocardial
   infarction.
   Objective: To perform an overview of the 4 primary prevention trials of
   aspirin therapy to obtain the most reliable estimates of the effects of
   aspirin therapy on various vascular disease end points.
   Methods and Results: These 4 trials included more than 51 000 subjects
   and 2284 important vascular events. Those assigned to aspirin therapy
   experienced significant reductions of 32\% (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 21\%-41\%) for nonfatal myocardial infarction and 13\% (95\% CI,
   5\%-19\%) for any important vascular event. There were possible small
   but nonsignificant increases in risks of vascular disease-related death
   (1\%; 95\% CI, -12\% to 16\%) and nonfatal stroke (8\%; 95\% CI, -12\%
   to 33\%). When strokes were subdivided by type, there was no significant
   effect of aspirin therapy on the risk of ischemic stroke, but, while
   based on small numbers, there was a 1.7-fold apparent increase (95\% CI,
   6\%-269\%) in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, which did achieve
   statistical significance.
   Conclusions: For the primary prevention of vascular disease, aspirin
   therapy confers significant beneficial effects on first myocardial
   infarction and, as a result, on any important vascular event; these
   effects are clinically important. Whether there is any reduction in
   vascular disease-related death or stroke associated with treatment
   remains unclear because of inadequate numbers of events in the primary
   prevention trials completed to date. More data on hemorrhagic stroke are
   also needed. In addition, randomized trial data, especially in women but
   also in men, are needed to help to formulate a rational public health
   policy for individuals at usual risk. Meanwhile, these data provide
   evidence for a significant benefit of aspirin therapy in the primary
   prevention of myocardial infarction.}},

Abstract = {{Gd2O3 has been deposited epitaxially on GaN using elemental Gd and an
   electron cyclotron resonance oxygen plasma in a gas-source molecular
   beam epitaxy system. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy
   shows a high concentration of dislocations which arise from the large
   lattice mismatch between the two materials. GaN
   metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) fabricated
   using a dielectric stack of single crystal Gd2O3 and amorphous SiO2 show
   modulation at gate voltages up to 7 V and are operational at source
   drain voltages up to 80 V. This work represents demonstrations of single
   crystal growth of Gd2O3 on GaN and of a GaN MOSFET using Gd2O3 in the
   gate dielectric. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Data are presented on photopumped AlGaAs-GaAs quantum-well (QW)
   heterostructure lasers with oxide-semiconductor distributed Bragg
   reflector (DBR) vertical confinement (and Fabry-Perot cleaved edges)

   spectra. For narrow samples (less than or similar to 20 mum), with the
   vertical DBRs ``tuned{''} below the QW recombination transitions (E-1
   lowest, E-2 higher), single mode EE operation occurs on E-2 at a
   wavelength similar to 77 meV above the lowest QW energy. For wide
   samples with an oxide-semiconductor vertical DBR located in a narrow
   band at the sample cleave edges, the DBR region acts as a spacial and
   spectral filter, thus increasing the possibility of single-mode EE
   operation. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. {[}S0003-

Abstract = {{The surface of poly (9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO) film was modified by 1.0
   keV Ar+ irradiation with a dose of 6.5x10(14) ions/cm(2) prior to Ca
   deposition. Ultraviolet and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies
   indicated that the modified surface could effectively block Ca diffusion
   into the PFO film and prevent the formation of doping-induced bipolaron
   states in the former forbidden energy gap. As a result, a sharper metal
   contact on the surface of the PFO film could be formed, compared to that
   on the surface without Ar+ irradiation. The results suggest that the
   judicial surface modification of polymer surfaces may be useful for the
   improvement of metal/polymer contacts and thus device performance. (C)

Abstract = {{The increase in the use of photographs on individual identification
   credentials such as driving licences, credit cards, security passes and
   passports has led, for the purpose of criminal activities, to the
   falsification of genuine documents bearing photographs of the
   perpetrating criminal. These photographs may be used as valuable
   physical evidence when compared with known photographs of a suspect as
   they form somewhat of a signature of the suspect that is left behind on
   the evidence. The comparison of ID photographs requires the cooperation
   of two predominantly visual disciplines; forensic photography and
   morphological anatomy. This paper describes a photographic technique
   which allows accurate anatomical measurement and tracing of Facial
   features, which allows direct physical comparison of ID document images.

   with a gasdynamic code with good agreement. It was possible to
   simultaneously model the whole evolution of the plasma, the shock wave,
   and the hot core air. The shock wave velocity was determined to be
   greater than or equal to 60 km s(-1) at 20 ns. The plasma temperature
   was found to reach about 1.7x10(4) K at 1 mus and the hot core air

Abstract = {{Adaptation to hypoxic stress provokes activation of the

   e.g., erythropoietin or vascular endothelial growth factor. Detailed
   information on signaling pathways that stabilize HIF-1 is missing, but
   reactive oxygen species degrade the HIF-1 alpha subunit, whereas
   phosphorylation causes its stabilization. It was believed that hypoxia
   resembles the only HIP-I inducer but recent evidence characterized other
   activators of HIP-I such as nitric oxide (NO). Herein, we concentrated
   on NO-evoked HIP-I induction as a heretofore unappreciated inflammatory
   response in association with massive NO formation. We demonstrated that
   S-nitrosoglutathione induces HIF-1 alpha accumulation and concomitant
   DNA binding. The response was attenuated by the kinase inhibitor
   genistein and blockers of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase such as Ly
   294002 or wortmannin. Whereas mitogen-activated protein kinases were not
   involved, we noticed phosphorylation/activation of Akt in correlation
   with HIF-1 alpha stabilization. NO appears to regulate HIF-1 alpha via
   the PI 3K/Akt pathway under normoxic conditions. (C) 2000 Academic

Abstract = {{The multi-site phosphorylation of the protein kinase C (PKC) superfamily
   plays an important role in the regulation of these enzymes. One of the
   key phosphorylation sites required for the activation of all PKC
   isoforms lies in the T-loop of the kinase domain. Recent in vitro and
   transfection experiments indicate that phosphorylation of this residue
   can be mediated by the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1
   (PDK1), In this study, we demonstrate that in embryonic stem (ES) cells
   lacking PDK1 (PDK1 -/- cells), the intracellular levels of endogenously
   expressed PKC alpha, PKC betaI, PKC gamma, PKC delta, PKC epsilon, and
   PKC-related kinase-1 (PRK1) are vastly reduced compared to control ES
   cells (PDK1 +/+ cells). The levels of PKC zeta and PRK2 protein are only
   moderately reduced in the PDK1 -/- ES cells. We demonstrate that in
   contrast to PKC zeta expressed PDK1 +/+ ES cells, PKC zeta in ES cells
   lacking PDK1 is not phosphorylated at its T-loop residue. This provides
   the first genetic evidence that PKC zeta is a physiological substrate
   for PDK1, In contrast, PRK2 is still partially phosphorylated at its
   T-loop in PDK1 -/- cells, indicating the existence of a PDK1-independent
   mechanism for the phosphorylation of PRK2 at this residue. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Over 100 sites in granitic country rock, mafic inclusions within
   granitic rock, and mafic dikes were sampled in the northernmost 550 km
   of the Patagonian batholith. After magnetic cleaning, some sites were
   rejected as magnetically unstable, and others were combined because they
   were contiguous and carried similar directions, hence probably
   representing duplicate samplings of the same direction of the
   geomagnetic field. A total of 42 well-determined directions - 29 from
   granitic country rock and inclusions and 13 from dikes - survived to be
   included in the interpretation. Most of these had a normal magnetic
   polarity, probably indicating that a disproportionate fraction of the
   North Patagonan batholith formed during the mid-Cretaceous long normal
   interval.
   Tectonic interpretation of paleomagnetic directions from intrusive rocks
   often is difficult because paleohorizontal indicators in such rocks are
   usually lacking. Rather than struggle against this limitation, we
   yielded to it and elected to concentrate on the shapes of our various
   data sets. The method used is simple and straightforward, involving
   Bingham statistics and small-circle fitting. From this analysis, it
   appears that the main structural feature within the North Patagonian
   batholith (NPB) - the Liquine-Ofqui fault zone - is a site of crustal
   detachment; a sliver of South America west of the fault is detached from
   the rest of the continent and has moved relatively northward. Because
   the main strands of the Liquine-Ofqui fault are curved and concave to
   the west, northward movement was accompanied by counterclockwise
   rotation. East of the fault, the NPB appears to have been the locus of
   distributed shear, mainly dextral, The principal period of deformation
   of the batholith appears to have been mid- or late Cenozoic, and may
   have been initiated by the arrival of the South America-Nazca
   (Farallon)-Phoenix (Aluk) triple junction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Human serum albumin (HSA) is an abundant plasma protein that is

   crystallographic study of five HSA-fatty acid complexes formed using
   saturated medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids (C10:0, C12:0,C14:0,
   C16:0 and C18:0). A total of seven binding sites that are occupied by
   all medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids have been identified,
   although medium-chain fatty acids are found to bind at additional sites
   on the protein, yielding a total of 11 distinct binding locations.
   Comparison of the different complexes reveals key similarities and
   significant differences in the modes of binding, and serves to
   rationalise much of the biochemical data on fatty acid interactions with
   albumin. The two principal drug-binding sites, in sub-domains IIA and
   IIIA, are observed to be occupied by fatty acids and one of them (in
   IIIA) appears to coincide with a high-affinity long-chain fatty acid
   binding site. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   receptor-binding region comprising amino acid residues that evolve
   sequentially from the central portion of the B chain alpha -helix. Two
   arginine residues in positions B13 and B17 that project like forefinger
   and middle finger from the helix provide the electrostatic
   element-opposed by the hydrophobic (thumb) element isoleucine (B20),
   offset from the arginines by about 40 degrees. The binding:intensity of
   relaxin to its receptor decreases by 3 orders of magnitude if alanine is
   substituted for the newly discovered binding component isoleucine in
   position B20. The arginine residues cannot be replaced by other positive
   charges, nor can the guanidinium group be presented on a longer or
   shorter hydrocarbon chain. In contrast, the hydrophobic interaction is
   incremental in nature, and the contribution to the total binding energy
   is roughly proportional to the number of hydrocarbon units in the side
   chain. It appears that a hydrophobic surface exists on the receptor
   that-offers optimal van der Waals' interaction with beta -branched
   hydrophobic amino acids. The binding energy increases roughly 10-fold
   with each methylene group whereby beta -branching is more effective per

Abstract = {{FlaA1 is a small soluble protein of unknown function in Helicobacter
   pylori, It has homologues that are essential for the virulence of
   numerous medically relevant bacteria. FlaA1 was overexpressed as a
   histidine-tagged protein and purified to homogeneity by nickel chelation
   and cation exchange chromatography, Spectrophotometric assays, capillary
   electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry analyses showed that FlaA1 is a
   novel bifunctional C-6 dehydratase/C-4 reductase specific for
   UDP-GlcNAc. It converts UDP-GlcNAc into a UDP-4-keto-6-methyl-GlcNAc
   intermediate, which is stereospecifically reduced into UDP-QuiNAc.
   Substrate conversions as high as 80\% were obtained at equilibrium. The
   K-m and V-max for UDP-GlcNAc were 159 muM and 65 pmol/min, respectively.
   No exogenous cofactor was required to obtain full activity of FlaA1,
   Additional NADH was only used with poor efficiency for the reduction
   step. The biochemical characterization of FlaA1 is important for the

Abstract = {{To improve the efficiency of liposome-mediated DNA transfer as a tool
   for gene therapy or vaccinology, we have further developed a new
   delivery system based on the modified immunopotentiating reconstituted
   influenza virus (IRIV). In this study, we engineered a plasmid DNA
   vector expressing the mumps virus hemagglutinin or the fusion protein.
   The administration of this DNA vaccine delivered by influenza virosomes,
   in combination with the mucosal adjuvant Escheriagen via the intranasal
   route, was efficient for inducing an immune response, both mucosally and
   systemically, in mice. The production of IgG2a mumps virus-specific
   antibodies and the secretion of interleukin 10 (IL-10) by
   antigen-specific T cells indicated that not only Th1 but also Th2
   responses were induced by this DNA vaccine formulation. These results
   suggest that cationic virosomes in combination with Escheriagen may have
   great potential as an efficient delivery system for intranasal DNA
   immunization and provide an immune barrier at the mucosal sites. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{422}},
Pages = {{91-123}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{A methodology for deriving a pressure-strain correlation model with
   variable coefficients is developed. The methodology is based on two
   important premises: (i) the extreme states of turbulence - the rapid
   distortion and equilibrium limits - are more amenable to mathematically
   rigorous modelling because of significant simplifications not possible
   at other states; and (ii) the models of the extreme states collectively
   contain all of the relevant physics so that models for any intermediate
   state can be obtained by suitable interpolation. A pressure-strain model
   of the standard form is considered and the coefficients are determined
   from linear analysis in the rapid distortion limit and from a fixed
   point analysis in the equilibrium limit. The model coefficients, which
   depend on the mean deformation and turbulence: state, vary from flow to
   flow in a manner consistent with Navier-Stokes physics.
   The exact causal relationship between the model coefficients and the
   model's equilibrium behaviour is established by fixed point analysis
   performed using representation theory. Then, the equilibrium values of
   the model coefficients are chosen to yield the observed equilibrium
   behaviour. The values of the model coefficients in the rapid distortion
   limit are determined by enforcing consistency with the Crow constraint.
   The new variable-coefficient model reduces to the traditional
   constant-coefficient model in strain-dominated turbulent flows near
   equilibrium. The model performance in benchmark turbulent flows, in
   which the traditional models have been calibrated extensively, is
   preserved intact. The new model is significantly different from the
   traditional one in mean vorticity-dominated and non-equilibrium
   turbulence. These two important classes of flows, in which traditional
   models fail, are successfully captured by the new model.}},

Abstract = {{We constrain the mass-to-light ratios, gas mass fractions, baryon mass
   fractions, and the ratios of total to luminous mass for a sample of
   eight nearby relaxed galaxy groups and clusters: A262, A426, A478,
   A1795, A2052, A2063, A2199, and MKW 4s. We use ASCA spatially resolved
   spectroscopic X-ray observations and ROSAT PSPC images to constrain the
   total and gas masses of these clusters. To measure cluster luminosities,
   we use galaxy catalogs resulting from the digitization and automated
   processing of the second generation Palomar Sky Survey plates calibrated
   with CCD images in the Gunn-Thuan g, r, and i bands.
   Under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry,
   we can measure the total masses of clusters from their intracluster gas
   temperature and density profiles. Spatially resolved ASCA spectra show
   that the gas temperature decreases with increasing distance from the
   center. By comparison, the assumption that the gas is isothermal results
   in an underestimate of the total mass at small radii and an overestimate
   at large cluster radii.
   We have obtained luminosity functions for all clusters in our sample.
   After correcting for background and foreground galaxies, we estimate the
   total cluster luminosity using Schechter function fits to the galaxy
   catalogs. In the three lowest redshift clusters where we can sample to
   fainter absolute magnitudes, we have detected a flattening of the
   luminosity function at intermediate magnitudes and a rise at the faint
   end. These clusters were fitted with a sum of two Schechter functions.
   The remaining clusters were well fitted with a single Schechter
   function.
   Assuming H-0 = 50 h(50) km s(-1) Mpc(-1), the measured mass-to-light
   ratios are similar to 100 h(50) M./L.. This, along with a high baryonic
   fraction, is indicative of a low-density universe with Omega0 similar to
   0.15-0.2.}},

Abstract = {{A fully automated HPLC method for analysing the non-ionic X-ray contrast

   The maximum load of iodixanol on the trace enrichment column was 3.75

   sensitive down to 84 pmol/ml and had a high precision over a linear
   range up to 320 nmol/ml. Although developed for iodixanol, the method
   can easily be modified and applied to other substances with similar

   spherical copper particles were prepared from aqueous copper sulphate
   solution by borohydride reduction. In the second stage, these small
   particles were mixed with appropriate amount of copper sulphate and
   sodium ascorbate, which resulted in the production of larger size cubic
   copper particles. In the latter step, the new grown larger particles
   acted as seed and grew larger due to the reduction of copper ions by
   ascorbate ion on their surfaces, Thus cubic copper nanoparticles of
   varied size regime were produced by ascorbate ion by varying the ratio

Abstract = {{We recently reported that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) enhances
   Ca2+](i) through an increase in L-type Ca2+ current (I-Ca,I-L) in adult
   cardiomyocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether LIF
   activates Ca2+-dependent signaling molecules, such as calcineurin and
   calmodulin kinases II and IV (CaMKII and CaMKIV), and, if so, whether
   these Ca2+-mediated signaling events contribute to LIF-mediated cardiac
   hypertrophy. We first confirmed that LIF increased I-Ca,I-L and
   {[}Ca2+](i) in primary cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes.
   Calcineurin, CaMKII, and CaMKIV activities increased at 2 minutes and
   peaked by 1.6-, 2.2-, and 2.2-fold, respectively, at 15 minutes.
   Nicardipine or verapamil fully inhibited these activities.
   Autophosphorylation of CaMKII was also observed to parallel the timing
   of CaMKII activity, and this phosphorylation was blocked by nicardipine,
   verapamil, or EGTA. LIF treatment led to a 3-fold increase in nuclear
   factor of activated T cell-luciferase activity. To confirm that inositol
   triphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum was
   not involved in this process, IP3 content and phosphorylation of
   phospholipase C gamma were investigated. LIF did not increase IP3
   content or phosphorylate phospholipase C gamma. KN62 (an inhibitor of
   CaMKII and CaMKIV) attenuated c-fos, brain natriuretic peptide, alpha
   -skeletal actin, and atrial natriuretic peptide expression. KN62
   suppressed the LIF-induced increase in {[}H-3]phenylalanine uptake and
   cell size. Cyclosporin A and FK506 slightly attenuated brain natriuretic
   peptide but did not affect c-fos or atrial natriuretic peptide
   expression. Cyclosporin A significantly reduced the LIF-induced increase
   in {[}H-3]phenylalanine uptake. These findings indicated that LIF

Abstract = {{Part type selection (PTS) and machine loading are two major problems in
   the production planning of flexible manufacturing systems. In this
   paper, we solve these problems by the use of genetic algorithms (GAs).
   We exploit the problem's MIP (mixed integer programming) model to make
   our GA more meaningful and less computation-intensive. The GA strategy
   is developed in three parts: solution coding, solution generation and
   solution recombination. In solution coding, we replace the original
   binary routing variables with integer variables and thus reduce the
   chromosome length significantly. Tn solution generation, the level of
   Feasibility is the main concern. We divide the constraints into two
   categories: direct and indirect. The direct constraints involve only two
   variables each and are easily satisfied by context-dependent genes.
   Since the direct constraints form the major chunk of constraints, their
   satisfaction controls infeasibility to a large extent. The remaining
   indirect constraints are handled by the penalty function approach. The
   solution recombination involves crossover and mutation. The crossover is
   performed in two steps, the PTS swap, followed by the routing swap, so
   that the feasibility level is not disturbed. With a similar intent, the
   mutation is allowed to operate only on selective genes. All the steps
   are illustrated with examples. Our GA is able to achieve optimum or
   near-optimum performance on a variety of objectives. A parametric study
   of GA factors is also carried out, indicating population size and
   mutation probability as influential parameters.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical method was developed for the determination of bosentan and
   its three main metabolites in various matrices and species with focus on
   robustness. The drug assay involved protein precipitation, followed by
   liquid-liquid extraction and column switching in combination with narrow
   bore HPLC-MS-MS. Deuterated analogues of the analytes were used as
   internal standards. The sample preparation procedure was optimised with
   respect to minimise the suppression effects from different matrices. The
   drug and its metabolites could be analysed in plasma, serum, bile, and
   liver samples from man, dog, and rat with a run cycle time of 10 min.
   The method used always calibration samples made up in human plasma,
   whereas quality control samples were prepared in human plasma as well as
   in the identical matrix as the unknown samples. Calibration graphs for
   the drug and for the metabolites were linear in the range from 1 or 2 to
   2000 or 10 000 ng/ml using a sample volume of 0.25 ml. Mean inter-assay
   precision and accuracy were 3.0\% and 98.4\%, respectively. Two
   additional methods were derived from the main method for the analysis of
   plasma samples only with focus on reduced manual effort and instrumental
   run cycle time. The modified methods showed a mean inter-assay precision
   and accuracy of 5.0\% and 99.9\% for the method using column-switching,
   and 3.5\% and 98.8\% for the method using off-line SPE, respectively.
   All methods proved to be robust, sensitive, and selective during the
   analysis of several thousand samples. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All

Abstract = {{This study presents a tree-structured regression (TSR) method to relate
   daily precipitation with a variety of free-atmosphere variables.
   Historical data were used to identify distinct weather patterns
   associated with differing types of precipitation events. Models were
   developed using 67 \% of the data for training and the remaining data
   for model validation. Seasonal models were built for each of 2 US sites:
   San Francisco, California, and San Antonio, Texas. The average
   correlation between observed and simulated daily precipitation data
   series is 0.75 for the training set and 0.68 for the validation set.
   Relative humidity was found to be the dominant variable in these TSR
   models. Output from an NCAR CSM (climate system model) transient
   simulation of climate change were then used to drive the TSR models in
   the prediction of precipitation characteristics under climate change. A
   preliminary screening of the GCM output variables for current climate,
   however, revealed significant problems for the San Antonio site.
   Specifically, the CSM missed the annual trends in humidity for the grid
   cell containing this site. CSM output for the San Francisco site was
   found to be much more reliable. Therefore, we present future
   precipitation estimates only for the San Francisco site.}},

Abstract = {{We present dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a lattice-gas model for
   bromine electrodeposition on single-crystal silver (100). This system
   undergoes a continuous phase transition between a disordered phase at
   low electrode potentials and a commensurate c(2 x 2) phase at high
   potentials. The lattice-gas parameters are determined by fitting
   simulated equilibrium adsorption icsotherms to chronocoulometric data,
   and free-energy barriers for adsorption/desorption and lateral diffusion
   are estimated from ab-initio data in the literature. Cyclic
   voltammograms in the quasi-static limit are obtained by equilibrium
   Monte Carlo simulations, while for nonzero potential scan rates we use
   dynamic Monte Carlo simulation. The butterfly shapes of the simulated
   voltammograms are in good agreement with experiments. Simulated
   potential-step experiments give results for the time evolution of the Br
   coverage, as well as the c(2 x 2) order parameter and its correlation
   length. During phase ordering following a positive potential step, the
   system obeys dynamic scaling. The disordering following a negative
   potential step is well described by random desorption with diffusion.
   Both ordering and disordering processes are strongly influenced by the
   ratio of the time scales for desorption and diffusion. Our results
   should be testable by experiments, in particular cyclic voltammetry and
   surface X-ray scattering. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{G protein-coupled receptors regulate gene expression by cellular
   signaling cascades that target transcription factors and their
   recognition by specific DNA sequences, In the central nervous system,
   heteromeric metabotropic gamma -aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B))
   receptors through adenylyl cyclase regulate cAMP levels, which may
   control transcription factor binding to the cAMP response element. Using
   yeast-two hybrid screens of rat brain libraries, we now demonstrate that
   GABA(B) receptors are engaged in a direct and specific interaction with
   the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4), a member of the cAMP
   response element-binding protein/ATF family. As confirmed by pull-down
   assays, ATF-4 associates via its conserved basic leucine zipper domain
   with the C termini of both GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R) 1 and GABA(B)R2
   at a site which serves to assemble these receptor subunits in
   heterodimeric complexes. Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows that
   GABA(B)R and ATF-4 are strongly coclustered in the soma and at the
   dendritic membrane surface of both cultured hippocampal neurons as well
   as retinal amacrine cells in vivo. In oocyte coexpression assays short
   term signaling of GABA(B)Rs via G proteins was only marginally affected
   by the presence of the transcription factor, but ATF-4 was moderately
   stimulated in response to receptor activation in in vivo reporter
   assays. Thus, inhibitory metabotropic GABA(B)Rs may regulate
   activity-dependent gene expression via a direct interaction with ATF-4.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary (human) intake of fluoride (F) largely through consumption of
   agricultural produce grown in F contaminated environment, has recently
   been viewed as an important cause for several F related health problems
   in many parts of the world. Being a non-essential element, F is usually
   taken up by plants through passive uptake - a process which is
   dominantly diffusion controlled. Still very little is known regarding F
   diffusion in soil, Tn present study, diffusion of F in the alluvial soil
   (Entisol) of Dayalbagh (Agra) has been investigated as a function of
   soil water content (theta) and F concentration gradient. The data on F
   diffusion coefficients were recorded bg determining the F concentration
   profile in horizontally incubated and homogenized soil columns, under
   varied experimental conditions (theta = 0.12-0.25 cm cm(-3), pH = 7.3
   +/- 0.2, incubation time (t) = 96-384 h, temperature = 303 +/- 1.2 K,
   The effects of aluminium and calcium, which are known to be strong
   binders for F in soil, on the F diffusion have also been investigated.
   The study, particularly, throws light on the possible dual role of
   aluminium in affecting the diffusion of F in soil which might prove
   critical in the ultimate uptake of F by plants in specific environmental
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Here,ve report the molecular cloning of the chicken (Gallus gallus)
   neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor Y2, the first nonmammalian Y2 receptor. It
   displays 75-80\% identity to mammalian Y2 and has a surprisingly
   divergent cytoplasmic tail. Expression of the receptor protein in a cell
   line showed that the receptor did not bind the mammalian Y2 selective
   antagonist BIIE0246, Furthermore, porcine {[}Leu(31), Pro(34)]NPY, which
   binds poorly to mammalian Y2, exhibited an unexpectedly high affinity
   for chicken Y2. In situ hybridisation revealed expression in the
   hippocampus. Thus, the chicken Y2 receptor exhibits substantial
   differences with regard to sequence and pharmacological profile in
   comparison to mammalian Y2 receptors, while the expression pattern in
   the central nervous system resembles that observed in mammals. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Voltammetric studies-of c-type cytochromes at clay-modified pyrolytic
   graphite electrodes have been undertaken as providing a good model for
   investigating interactions of proteins with soils. Different clays have
   been investigated according to their global charge, composition and
   hydrophobicity. The electrochemical behavior of either mitochondrial or
   bacterial cytochromes at these modified electrodes has been used to
   define a general rule for the nature of interactions between cytochromes
   and clays. The influence of various parameters such as pi values of
   proteins, pH, ionic strength, composition of the clay coating, on the
   electrochemical response is reported. It is demonstrated that while
   electrostatic interactions are responsible for the electrochemical
   promotion of cytochrome c, hydrophobic factors play a key role in the
   electron transfer process on multiheme cytochromes at clay-modified
   electrodes. Finally, the consequences of these interactions on the metal
   reductase activity developed by bacterial polyheme c-type cytochromes
   have been discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6)
   inhibitor p16INK4A may be caused by gene deletion, mutation or promoter
   hypermethylation. We have previously reported that p16INK4A in
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines is inactivated
   predominantly by promoter hypermethylation rather than genomic
   aberrations. In the present experiments, we have studied the effects of
   the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA/decitabine), on
   the expression of aberrant p16INK4A RNA transcripts and the
   CDK-retinoblastoma gene pathway in HCC cell lines with p16INK4A promoter
   hypermethylation. The expression of aberrant p16INK4A RNA transcripts
   was down-regulated and p16INK4A protein was strongly re-expressed in the
   HCC cell lines, SNU 354, 398, 423 and 475 after 5-AZA/decitabine
   treatment for 5 days. The re-expressed p16INK4A was functional, because
   it bound to and inhibited CDK4 kinase activity, and increased the
   concentrations of the hypophosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein
   (pRB) in cells with a wild type RE gene. Moreover, treatment with the
   demethylating agent led not only to G1 cell cycle arrest, but also to
   the increased expression of the senescence-associated marker beta
   -galactosidase. This up-regulation of p16INK4A mRNA and protein
   correlated with demethylation of the p16INK4A promoter. and with the
   down-regulation or disappearance of aberrant p161NK4A transcripts. The;e
   results suggest that the aberrant p16INK4A RNA transcript can be
   transcribed from the methylated p16INK4A gene, and endogenous
   reactivation of functional p16INK4A mRNA by a demethylating agent can
   restore the pRB pathway in HCC, and foster the terminal differentiation
   of the malignant cells. Therefore, demethylating agents, such as
   5-AZA/decitabine, may have potential in the treatment of HCC. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We labeled interneurons in the L1-L2 and L6-S1 spinal cord segments of
   the rat that are involved in bladder innervation using transneuronal
   retrograde transport of pseudorabies virus (PRV) in normal animals and
   in animals with selected nerve transections. Preganglionic neurons were
   identified using antisera against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). In
   some experiments we labelled parasympathetic preganglionic neurons
   (PPNs) in the L6-S1 spinal cord by retrograde transport of Fluorogold
   from the major pelvic ganglion. We identified bladder afferent terminals
   using the transganglionic transport of the anterograde tracer cholera
   toxin subunit b. We present anatomical evidence for two spinal pathways
   involved in innervation of the bladder. First, in the intact rat,
   afferent information from the bladder connects, via interneurons in
   L6-S1, to the PPNs that provide the efferent innervation of the bladder.
   The afferent terminals were located mainly in close apposition to
   interneurons located dorsal to the retrogradely labeled PPNs. Second,
   using L6-S1 ganglionectomies or L6-S1 ventral root rhizotomies we
   limited viral transport to the sympathetic pathways innervating the
   bladder. This procedure also labelled interneurons (but not PPNs) with
   PRV in the L6-S1 spinal cord in a location very similar to those
   described in the intact rat. These interneurons also receive bladder
   afferent terminals but we propose that they project to sympathetic
   preganglionic neurons, most of which are in the L1-L2 spinal segments.
   Based on this anatomical evidence, we propose the existence of two
   spinal reflex pathways involved in micturition: a pathway limited to a
   reflex are in the pelvic nerve (presumably excitatory to the detrusor
   muscle); and a pathway involving the pelvic nerve and sympathetic nerve
   fibers, some of which may travel in the hypogastric (presumably
   inhibitory to the detrusor muscle). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Switching between the active (ATP and DNA bound) and inactive
   conformations of the homologous recombination RecA protein is regulated
   by Am hydrolysis. First, we use the homologous pairing domain of RecA
   derived from its mobile loop L2 to show that the interaction of this
   random coil peptide with the gamma -phosphate of ATP results in a
   peptide beta -conformation similar to that previously shown to be
   induced by DNA binding. Next, we show that in the whole RecA protein two
   residues in this L2 domain, Gln194 and Arg196, are catalytic amino acid
   residues for ATP hydrolysis and functionally resemble the corresponding
   residues engaged in GTP hydrolysis by two distinct classes of G
   proteins. Finally, we show that the role of DNA and high salt in the
   stimulation of the ATPase of RecA is to stabilize this highly mobile
   region involved in hydrolysis. This is a role similar to that described
   for RGSs in the activation of the GTPase of heterotrimeric G proteins.
   Therefore, (i) a prototypical DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-stimulated
   DNA-binding protein, RecA, and eukaryotic signaling proteins share
   common stereochemical regulatory mechanisms; and (ii) in a remarkable
   example of parsimony, loop L2 is a molecular switch that controls both
   ATP promoted DNA binding and pairing reactions and DNA stimulated ATP
   hydrolysis. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   However, the E286Q mutant of VMA1, which assembles inactive V-ATPase

   markers for cell recruitment, activation, and mucosal synthesis of
   immunoregulatory molecules. Self-organizing maps were applied to cluster

   histopathological scores to identify genes associated with increased
   disease activity. Clustering was achieved on the basis of differences in
   expression levels across individual specimens. Several inflammatory
   mediators were identified as likely determinants of characteristic
   histological features of active UC. These results provide proof of
   principle for application of functional genomics to larger inflammatory

Abstract = {{Second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory has been used to
   calculate the interaction energy between a water molecule and acenes as
   large as C96H24. The results of these calculations lead to an estimated
   value of -5.8 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol for the electronic binding energy of a
   water molecule with single-layer graphite. This value is comparable to
   the -5.0 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol binding energy of the hydrogen bonded water
   dimer, suggesting that the water/graphite interactions will play an
   important role in determining the structure of water on graphite, as
   well as of water inside carbon nanotubes. The present estimate of the
   binding energy of a water molecule to a graphite sheet is appreciably
   larger than those previously reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{O(3P) is a highly reactive species which may cause damage to materials
   on contact. In low Earth orbit (LEO), high-energy collisions (similar
   to4.5 eV) of O(3P) with spacecraft materials can lead to extensive
   degradation. In this study, we use ab initio molecular orbital
   calculations to investigate the possibility of chain breaking in
   polyethylene caused by a single O(3P) attack under LEO conditions,
   because the occurrence of such reactions could greatly accelerate the
   erosion. The smallest alkanes (n = 2, 3, 5, or 7) serve as models of
   polyethylene. For the case of ethane (n = 2), we explore the triplet
   potential energy surface of the following reaction: O(3P) + CH3-CH3 -->
   O-CH3 + CH3. Analogous reactions, in which O(3P) attacks a central
   carbon atom, are studied for the higher alkanes. Results obtained using
   the Hartree-Fock method, density functional theory, and, in the simplest
   case (i.e,, ethane), second-order Moller Plesset perturbation theory,
   Gaussian theoretical models (G1, G2, and G2MP2), and complete basis set
   (CBS-QB3) approaches are reported. We conclude that conditions in LEO
   are conducive to chain breaking in polyethylene caused by a single O(3P)
   attack.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied a new cationic and anionic surfactant system which
   consists of tetradecyldimethylamine oxide (C(14)DMAO) and
   dodecylethoxysulfonic acid {[}CH3(CH2)(11)(CH2CH2O)(2.5)SO3H, Texapon
   N-70-H] where no salt in the mixed solutions is formed from the
   combination of the two surfactants. First, we mixed C(14)DMAO and
   Texapon N-70-H where the total concentration was 100 mM and the mole
   fraction varied from 0 to 1 for each component. With increasing mole
   fractions of Texapon N-70-H We observe a L-1-phase, a viscous L-1-phase,
   a two-phase L-1/L-alpha-region where the low birefringent L-alpha-phase
   is on the top of the L-alpha-phase, and after the two-phase
   L-1/L-alpha-region a single low birefringent but viscoelastic
   L-alpha-phase, and finally at almost equal mole fraction a precipitate.
   On further increasing Texapon N70-H mole fractions, the sequence of the
   phases is reversed again. In the L-alpha-phase, the rheological
   measurements show that the complex viscosities (\textbackslash{}
   eta{*}\textbackslash{}, v = 0.01 Hz) are much higher than those in
   viscous L-1-phase, and furthermore show that the L-alpha-phase has a
   more or less frequency-independent storage modulus. Freeze-fracture
   electron micrograph results show that small unilamellar and
   multilamellar vesicles coexist in the L-alpha-phase. The size range of
   the small unilamellar vesicles is from 20 nm to the big ones with
   diameters larger 1.0 mum, and the multilamellar vesicles are relatively
   small in quantity (the largest multilamellar vesicles are 3.5 mum or
   so). It is also demonstrated that a classic L-alpha-phase as opposed to
   a vesicle phase is produced in the new cationic and anionic surfactant
   mixed solutions by a different preparation route in which the
   L-alpha-phase is prepared without shear by mixing a small amount of
   methyl formate to a L-1-phase from C(14)DMAO and sodium
   dodecylethoxysulfate {[}CH3(CH2)(11)(CH2CH2-CH2O)(2.5)SO3Na, Texapon
   N-70] BY this route, one obtains the stacked L-alpha-phaseBnd no
   vesicles. In the second pathway, methyl formate hydrolyses to formic
   acid that protonates the amine oxide headgroups of C(14)DMAO to the
   cationic surfactant (C(14)DMAOH(+)) and thus triggers the transformation
   of the L-1-phase to the L-alpha-phase. The L-alpha-phase formed by the
   simple hydrolysis has stacked bilayers and can be transformed into
   vesicle by the shearing forces that occur when the samples with the
   classic L-alpha-phase are turned upside down a few times, The
   L-alpha-phase and vesicle phase have different macroproperties. This has
   been demonstrated by rheological measurements, SANS and FF-TEM. Our
   experimental results show that spontaneously formed vesicles that are
   often formed in cationic and anionic surfactant mixtures may be the
   result of shearing forces that occur during the mixing process of the
   two components. It is furthermore shown that the L-alpha-phase and the
   vesicle phases that are formed by the chemical reaction have different
   macroscopic properties from the systems that were prepared from the
   zwiterionic surfactant (C(14)DMAO) and Texapon N70-H acid.
   In the latter situation, the vesicle phases do not contain excess salt
   and the ionic charges on the vesicles are not shielded. As a
   consequence, the vesicle phases are strongly viscoelastic and have a
   yield stress that is large enough to suspend small dispersed air bubbles
   in the solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been reported in
   tangle-bearing neurons of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and
   can be induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha). High CNS
   levels of TNF alpha are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such
   as AD, where neurons dependent on neurotrophins such as nerve growth
   factor (NGF) are particularly affected. In this study we determined the
   effect of TNF alpha on iNOS in NGF-responsive pheochromocytoma (PC12)
   cells. We found that while TNF alpha and NGF alone were unable to induce
   iNOS, their simultaneous addition resulted in iNOS induction and the
   release of nitric oxide. Our results suggest that synergistic iNOS
   induction by TNF alpha and NGF may occur in selective population of
   NGF-responsive neurons in the presence of elevated CNS levels of TNF
   alpha. NeuroReport 11:3453-3456 (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}},

Abstract = {{The use of approximate projection methods for modeling low Mach number
   flows avoids many of the numerical complications associated with exact
   projection methods, but introduces additional design choices in
   developing a robust algorithm. In this paper we first explore these
   design choices in the setting of inviscid incompressible ow using
   several computational examples. We then develop a framework for
   analyzing the behavior of the different design variations and use that
   analysis to explain the features observed in the computations. As part
   of this work we introduce a new variation of the approximate projection
   algorithm that combines the advantages of several of the previous
   versions.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of bioinformatics to characterize genomic sequences from
   pathogenic bacteria for prediction of genes that may encode vaccine
   candidates, e.g. surface localized proteins, has been evaluated. By
   applying appropriate tools for genomic mining to the published sequence
   of Haemophilus influenzae Rd genome, it was possible to identify a
   putative vaccine candidate, the outer membrane lipoprotein, P6.
   Proteomics complements genomics by offering abilities to rapidly
   identify the products of predicted genes, e.g. proteins in outer
   membrane preparations. The ability to identify the P6 protein uniquely
   from entries in a sequence database from the expected peptide-mass
   fingerprint of P6 demonstrates the power of proteomics. The application
   of proteomics for identification of vaccine candidates for another
   pathogenic bacterium, Helicobacter pylori using two different approaches
   is described. The first involves rapid identification of a series of
   monoclonal antibody reactive proteins from N-terminal sequence tags. The
   other approach involves identification of proteins in outer membrane
   preparations by 2-D electrophoresis followed by trypsin digestion and
   peptide mass map analysis. Our combined studies demonstrate that
   utilization of genome sequences by application of bioinformatics through
   genomics and proteomics can expedite the vaccine discovery process by
   rapidly providing a set of potential candidates for further testing. (C)

Abstract = {{Non-shearable precipitates and second-phase particles are efficient
   obstacles to dislocation motion that have an important effect on the
   strength and creep resistance of many materials, in particular
   oxide-dispersion-strengthened alloys. When the obstacles are clustered,
   the material cannot be considered as a homogeneous medium. Modelling its
   mechanical behaviour by means of constitutive laws requires an
   additional step of homogenisation. We propose here a new method based on
   the Delaunay triangulation of the obstacle distribution and compare it
   with a previously developed technique based on the Voronoi tessellation.
   The Delaunay triangulation is considered to be a better representation
   of local particle arrangement. It is shown that the softening effect of
   particle clustering is accentuated in the Delaunay triangulation

Abstract = {{Recombinant proteins have potential as both human and veterinary vaccine
   antigens, but they are often weakly immunogenic and immunization with
   recombinant proteins may not elicit a significant immune response that
   recognizes the native protein. This report describes the immune
   stimulating activity of two new adjuvant formulations, a zinc-chitosan
   particle formulation designed to bind to histidine tagged recombinant
   proteins; and an emulsion formulation containing chitosan. BALB/c mice
   vaccinated with formulations comprising recombinant beta-human chorionic
   gonadotropin (beta hCG) and each adjuvant had prolonged high titer
   antibodies that recognized both the recombinant beta hCG and native hCG.
   beta hCG is an established target for immunocontraceptive vaccines and a
   potential target for tumor immunotherapy. Isotype analysis of these
   antibodies revealed an IgG1 response in mice immunized with
   zinc-chitosan particles and a mixed IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b response with
   the emulsion. These chitosan based adjuvant formulations were effective
   in sensitizing mice and guinea pigs for antigen specific DTH responses,
   indicating that these adjuvants stimulate both B and T lymphocytes. The
   ability of these adjuvants to stimulate significant responses with a
   poorly immunogenic recombinant protein suggests that they may have
   potential in developing vaccines based on synthetic peptides and subunit
   antigens. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Adenylosuccinate lyase of Bacillus subtilis is a tetrameric enzyme which
   catalyzes the cleavage of adenylosuccinate to AMP and fumarate. We have
   mutated His(89), one of three conserved histidines, to Gin, Ala, Glu,
   and Arg. The enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to
   homogeneity. As compared to a specific activity of 1.56 mu mol of
   adenylosuccinate converted/min/mg protein fur wildtype enzyme, the
   mutant enzymes exhibit specific activities of 0.0225, 0.0036, 0.0036,
   and 0.0009 for H89Q, H89A, H89E, and H89R, respectively. Circular
   dichroism and FPLC gel filtration reveal that mutant enzymes have a
   similar conformation and oligomeric state to that of wild-type enzyme.
   In H89Q, the K-M for adenylosuccinate increases slightly to 2.5-fold
   that of wild-type, the kid for fumarate is elevated 3.3-fold, and the
   K-M fur AMP is 13 times higher than that observed in wild-type enzyme.
   The catalytic efficiency of the H89Q enzyme is compromised, with
   k(cat)/K-M reduced 174-fold in the direction of AMP formation. These
   data suggest that His(89) plays a role in both the binding of the AMP
   portion of the substrate and in correctly orienting the substrate for
   catalysis. Incubation of H89Q with inactive H141Q enzyme {[}Lee, T. T.,
   Worby, C., Bao, Z.-Q., Dixon, J. E., and Colman, R. F. (1999)
   Biochemistry 38, 22-32] leads to a 30-fold increase in activity. This
   intersubunit complementation indicates that His(89) and His(141) from
   different subunits participate in the active site and that both are
   required for catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Postsegregational killing (PSK) systems consist of a tightly linked
   toxin-antitoxin pair. Antitoxin must be continually produced to prevent
   the longer lived toxin from killing the cell. PSK systems on plasmids
   are widely believed to benefit the plasmid by ensuring its stable
   vertical inheritance. However, experimental tests of this
   ``stability{''} hypothesis were not consistent with its predictions. We
   suggest an alternative hypothesis to explain the evolution of PSK: that
   PSK systems have been selected through benefiting host plasmids in
   environments where plasmids must compete during horizontal reproduction.
   In this ``competition{''} hypothesis, success of PSK systems is a
   consequence of plasmid-plasmid competition, rather than from an adaptive
   plasmid-host relationship. In support of this hypothesis, a
   plasmid-encoded parDE PSK system mediated the exclusion of an isogenic
   Delta parDE plasmid. An understanding of how PSK systems influence
   plasmid success may provide insight into the evolution of other
   determinants (e.g., antibiotic resistance and virulence) also rendering
   a cell potentially dependent on an otherwise dispensable plasmid.}},

   Like most Turdus thrushes, Rufous-bellied thrushes are remarkable for

   covering its full geographical range. We measured the repertoire size,
   note duration and rhythm (frequency of note utterance), and combined
   these parameters with the Shannon entropy values calculated for each
   individual. Although individuals maintain species-specific recognition
   capacity, we find a large variation between their song parameters and
   show that the information theory can be useful to analyse large and
   varied animal vocal repertoires. We are introducing two new parameters,

Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Background-In the Fontan circulation, pulmonary and systemic vascular
   resistances are in series. The implications of this unique arrangement
   on infradiaphragmatic venous physiology are poorly understood.
   Methods and Results-We studied the effects of respiration and gravity on
   infradiaphragmatic venous flows in 20 normal healthy volunteers
   (control) and 48 Fontan patients (atriopulmonary connection {[}APC]
   n=15, total cavopulmonary connection {[}TCPC] n=30). Hepatic venous
   (HV), subhepatic inferior vena caval (IVC), and portal venous (FV) flow
   rates were measured with Doppler ultrasonography during inspiration and
   expiration in both the supine and upright positions. The
   inspiratory-to-expiratory flow rate ratio was calculated to reflect the
   effect of respiration, and the supine-to-upright flow rate ratio was
   calculated to assess the effect of gravity. HV flow depended heavily on
   inspiration in TCPC compared with both control and APC subjects
   (inspiratory-to-expiratory flow rate ratio 3.3, 1.7, and 1.6,
   respectively; P<0.0001). Normal PV flow was higher in expiration, but
   this effect was lost in TCPC and APC patients (inspiratory-to-expiratory
   flow rate ratio 0.8, 1.0, and 1.1, respectively; P=0.01). The
   respiratory influence on IVC flow was the same in all groups. Gravity
   decreased HV flow more in APC than in TCPC patients (supine-to-upright
   flow rate ratio 3.2 versus 2.1, respectively; P<0.04) but reduced PV
   flow equally in all groups.
   Conclusions-Gravity and respiration have important influences on
   infradiaphragmatic venous return in Fontan patients. Although gravity
   exerts a significant detrimental effect on lower body venous return,
   which is more marked in APC than in TCPC patients, the beneficial
   effects of respiration in TCPC patients are mediated primarily by an
   increase in HV flow. These effects may have important short- and
   long-term implications for the hemodynamics of the Fontan circulation.}},

Abstract = {{The dimeric two-component system transmitter protein NRII (NtrB) of
   Escherichia coli, product of glnL (ntrB), controls transcription of
   nitrogen-regulated genes by catalyzing the phosphorylation and
   dephosphorylation of the transcription factor NRI (NtrC). Previous
   studies showed that the PII signal transduction protein inhibits the
   kinase activity of NRII and activates its phosphatase activity. We
   observed that PII greatly stimulated the NRII phosphatase activity under
   conditions where the cleavage of ATP was prevented, indicating that the
   phosphatase activity did not result simply from prevention of the
   antagonistic NRII kinase activity by PII. Rather, PII was an activator
   of the phosphatase activity. To study this regulation, we examined the
   dimerization and enzymatic activities of NRII and various polypeptides
   derived from NRII, and their regulation by PII. Our results were
   consistent with the hypothesis that NRII consists of three domains: an
   N-terminal domain found only in NRII proteins and two domains formed by
   the conserved transmitter module of NRII, the
   phosphotransferase/phosphatase/dimerization (central) domain and the
   kinase domain. All three domains were involved in regulating the kinase
   and phosphatase activities of NRII. The N-terminal domain was involved
   in intramolecular signal transduction, and controlled access to the NRII
   active site for the isolated dimeric central domain added in trans. The
   central domain was responsible for dimerization and the
   phosphotransferase and phosphatase activities of NRII, but the latter
   activity was weak in the isolated domain and was not regulated by PII.
   The C-terminal kinase domain was responsible for the kinase activity.
   The PII protein appeared to interact with the isolated transmitter
   module of NRII, and not with the N-terminal domain as previously
   thought, since PII dramatically increased the stoichiometry of
   autophosphorylation of the isolated transmitter module. However, the
   phosphatase activity of the transmitter module of NRII was low even in
   the presence of PII, suggesting that the N-terminal domain was necessary
   for the central domain to assume the conformation necessary for potent
   phosphatase activity. Also, PII significantly reduced the rate of
   transphosphorylation of the isolated central domain by the isolated
   kinase domain, suggesting that PII interacts directly with the kinase
   domain. We hypothesize that the binding of PII to the kinase domain of
   NRII results in an altered conformation that is transmitted to the
   central and N-terminal domains; this causes the central domain to assume
   the conformation with potent phosphatase activity.}},

Abstract = {{In order to clarify the physiological roles of the cytosolic forms of
   glutamine synthetase (GS) in Medicago truncatula, we have performed a
   detailed analysis of the expression of the two functional cytosolic GS
   genes, MtGSa and MtGSb in several organs of the plant. Transcriptional
   fusions were made between the 2.6 or 3.1 kbp 5' upstream regions of
   MtGSa or MtGSb, respectively, and the reporter gene gusA encoding beta
   -glucuronidase and introduced into the homologous transgenic system.
   MtGSa and MtGSb were found to be differentially expressed in most of the
   organs, both temporally and spatially. The presence of GS proteins at
   the sites where the promoters were active was confirmed by
   immunocytochemistry, providing the means to correlate gene expression
   with the protein products. These studies have shown that the putative
   MtGSa and MtGSb promoter fragments were sufficient to drive GUS
   expression in all the tissues and cell types where cytosolic GS proteins
   were located. This result indicates that the cis acting regulatory
   elements responsible for conferring the contrasting expression patterns
   are located within the region upstream of the coding sequences. MtGSa
   was preferentially expressed in the vascular tissues of almost all the
   organs examined, whereas MtGSb was preferentially expressed in the root

Abstract = {{Thin optical protective coatings of boron nitride, similar to1 mum
   thick, were deposited at low substrate temperature on polycarbonate (PC)
   and fused silica substrates by r.f. magnetron sputtering using a mixture
   of Ar + N-2 as the sputtering gas. The structure and composition of the
   deposited layers were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FTIR) and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The optical
   characterization of the coated sample was carried out by measuring the
   ultraviolet-visible transmittance at different wavelengths and the
   strength of adhesion of the deposited layers to the plastic substrate
   was analysed by a scratch test. The deposited layers grow with hexagonal
   structure, the resulting layers being nearly stoichiometric, and are
   highly transparent in the visible range on both substrates examined; the
   measured optical band-gap of the coating was 4.6 +/- 0.1 eV. The
   strength of adhesion to the polycarbonate was found to be dependent on
   the substrate pre-deposition treatment: ion etching of the PC surface
   before coating deposition gives rise to films with good adherence as a
   consequence of the formation of a mixed interface layer where C=N
   chemical bonds were observed by FTIR.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-seven unrelated Jewish Ashkenazi patients with nonsyndromic
   prelingual deafness (NSD) were analyzed for mutations in the coding
   sequence of the connexin 26 (Cx26) gene. Biallelic mutations were
   identified in 19 of the 27 patients (70.4\%); 12 were homozygous for the
   mutation 167delT, 12 were homozygous for the mutation 35delG, and 5 were
   compound 167delT/35delG; heterozygotes, In addition three patients were
   heterozygous with no second identified mutation in the Cx26 gene.
   Biallelic mutations in the Cx26 gene account for 83\% of familial cases
   and 44\% of the sporadic cases. Among 268 unselected Ashkenazi
   individuals, 20 were 167delT/N heterozygotes, giving an estimate of
   7.5\% carrier frequency. Based on the 167delT carrier frequency in three
   studies (including the present one), it is expected that 167delT/167delT
   homozygotes account for 70\% of all patients with NSD (1 in 1300), The
   hearing capacity of 30 patients (probands and their sibs) with biallelic
   Cx26 mutations and at least one allele with 167delT demonstrated inter-
   and intrafamilial variability from profound to mild hearing impairment.

Abstract = {{Role for microtubules in the induction of multiple microtubule
   organizing centers (MTOCs) and multipolar spindles by dimethylarsinic
   acid (DMAA), a methylated derivative of inorganic arsenics, was
   investigated with respect to the effects of microtubule disruption and
   reorganization. DMAA induced multiple signals of gamma -tubulin, a
   well-characterized component of MTOCs in the centrosome, in a manner
   specific to mitotic cells. The multiple signals of gamma -tubulin were
   co-localized with multipolar spindles caused by DMAA. Disruption of
   microtubules by nocodazole (NOZ) suppressed the appearance of centrosome
   injury caused by DMAA while disorganization of actin microfilaments by
   cytochalasin D did not. Post-treatment incubation of cells in which
   multiple signals of gamma -tubulin caused by DMAA had been coalesced to
   one or two dots by NOZ caused the reappearance of mitotic cells with
   multiple signals of gamma -tubulin, in conjunction with reorganization
   of the microtubules. These results suggest a role for microtubules in
   the dynamic behavior of the mitotic centrosome. DMAA induced aberrant
   cytokinesis, such as tripolar and quadripolar division, in a
   concentration-dependent manner. These results, together with the
   findings of earlier studies, suggest that the centrosome is the primary
   target for the induction of multipolar spindles by DMAA and the
   resultant induction of multinucleation and multipolar division. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Wastewaters containing organic compounds have been treated using
   extractive membrane bioreactors (EMBs). During treatment, a biofilm
   normally develops on the surface of the membrane, on the biological
   side. This study investigates the dynamics of biofilm growth in an EMB
   exposed to an alternating sequence of organic compounds. Microbial
   dynamics of both suspended and attached cultures were investigated
   experimentally in a single-tube extractive membrane bioreactor (STEMB),
   which comprised a continuous stirred-tank bioreactor (CSTB) coupled to
   eight single-tube extractive membrane modules (STEMMs) via a
   recirculating biomedium. A model microbial culture consisting of a
   Burk-holderia sp, strain JS150 (ATCC No. 51283), able to degrade
   monochlorobenzene, and a Xanthobacter autotrophicus sp. strain GJ10
   (ATCC No. 43050), able to degrade 1,2-dichloroethane, was used. Both
   microbial strains exhibited exclusive degradative capabilities. The CSTB
   was monitored by quantification of individual strains and by product and
   organic compound evolution. To investigate the biofilm growth dynamics,
   eight STEMMs were run in parallel with the same operating conditions.
   Every week, STEMMs were stopped for biofilm analysis and the organic
   compound in the wastewater was changed. Biofilm growth was investigated
   by quantification of individual strains, by evaluation of the;overall
   biofilm growth, and by microscopic analysis. A biofilm composed of both
   strains was developed and maintained during the whole experiment in the
   STEMMs. The biofilm that developed on the membrane improved the response
   of the system to changes in the wastewater. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{By decoding: the information inherent in chemical structures in terms of
   corresponding mathematical objects, clear chemical features are
   elicited. Group stabilizers and orbits have been used to reach this
   goal. The concept of chemical forms is shown to yield a class of
   involutions corresponding to each compound. From this, the cardinality
   of the class can be determined. Each compound is thereby provided with
   an invariant numerical characteristic Algebraic criteria describing the
   degree of saturation or unsaturation have also been found. Applications
   of these mathematical criteria are given to the study of specific
   feature of chemistry, which has decisive influence on the properties and
   reactivity of chemical compounds. No geometries or restriction to a
   specific quantum mechanical description are assumed in the approach. (C)

Abstract = {{A recognized cause of buccal aphthosis: Nicorandil is the leading drug
   in a new pharmacology class of well tolerated anti-angina products with
   vasodilating action. The first cases of buccal aphthosis or ulcerations
   induced by nicorandil were reported in 1996, Among drugs inducing buccal
   aphthosis or ulcerations, the largest body of information available on
   reported cases concern nicorandil.
   Characteristic lesions: Forty cases of painful buccal lesions induced by
   nicorandil have been recorded. Among the 8 publications in the
   literature, 7 were reported by French groups. The prevalence of this
   adverse effect is an estimated 5\%. Patient age varies from 60 to 90
   years with an even gender distribution. A history of aphthosis is noted
   in 23\% of the cases. The lesions vary in size from 0.5 cm to 3 cm and
   in number from 1 to 10, generally localized on the inner aspect of the
   cheeks or on the tongue. The lesions develop for about 3 to 36 before
   diagnosis and the delay to onset of signs after initiating nicorandil
   treatment is 15 days to 24 months (generally 2 months). Lesions
   basically develop after high-dose treatments and, for a few cases, after
   increasing the dosage, Cure is obtained in ail cases after 1 to 12
   weeks.
   Open questions: The probability that nicorandil is the cause of these
   ulcerations or aphthae is very high. Certain terms do however need to be
   defined with precision. Are we talking about aphthae or ulcerations ?
   The term painful ulceration would appear to be preferable because it
   includes both ulcerations and aphthae in cases lacking further
   information. The wide variability in the geographical distribution could
   likely be linked to underreporting, The notion of a dose effect suggests
   a toxic mechanism that could develop in predisposed populations (ethnic
   origin...) and would be directed against buccal targets (salivary
   glands...) via the active drug or its metabolites or via drug
   interactions. This new adverse effect of nicorandil is quite spectacular
   and very painful. However, no life-threatening event has been observed.}},

Journal = {{BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{321}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Objectives To determine the effectiveness of ranitidine and sucralfate
   in the prevention of stress ulcer in critical patients and to assess if
   these treatments affect the risk of nosocomial pneumonia.
   Design Published studies retrieved through Medline and other databases.
   Five meta-analyses evaluated effectiveness in terms of bleeding rates
   (A: ranitidine v placebo; B: sucralfate v placebo) and infectious
   complications in terms of incidence of nosocomial pneumonia (C:
   ranitidine v placebo; D: sucralfate v placebo; E: ranitidine v
   sucralfate). Trial quality was determined with an empirical ad hoc
   procedure.
   Main outcome measures Rates of clinically important gastrointestinal
   bleeding and nosocomial pneumonia (compared between the two study arms
   and expressed with odds ratios specific for individual studies and
   meta-analytic summary odds ratios);
   Results Meta-analysis A (five studies) comprised 398 patients;
   meta-analysis C (three studies) comprised 311 patients; meta-analysis D
   (two studies) comprised 226 patients: and meta-analysis E (eight
   studies) comprised 1825 patients. Meta-analysis B was not carried out as
   the literature search selected only one clinical trial. In meta-analysis
   A ranitidine was found to have the same effectiveness as placebo (odds
   ratio of bleeding 0.72, 95\% confidence interval 0.30 to 1.70, P =
   0.46). In placebo controlled studies (meta-analyses C and D) ranitidine
   and sucralfate had no influence on the incidence of nosocomial
   pneumonia. In comparison with sucralfate, ranitidine significantly
   increased the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia (meta-analysis E: 1.35,
   1.07 to 1.70, P = 0.012). The mean quality score in the four analyses
   (on a 0 to 10 scale) ranged from 5.6 in meta-analysis E to 6.6 in
   meta-analysis A.
   Conclusions Ranitidine is ineffective in the prevention of
   gastrointestinal bleeding in patients in intensive care and might
   increase the risk of pneumonia. Studies on sucralfate do not provide
   conclusive results. These findings are based on small numbers of
   patients, and firm conclusions cannot presently be proposed.}},

Abstract = {{To identify the molecular mechanisms involved in phagocytosis, we
   generated random insertion mutants of Dictyostelium discoideum and

   membrane protein with an N-terminal lumenal domain and nine potential
   transmembrane segments. Homologous genes can be identified in many
   species; however, their function is yet to be elucidated. Disruption of
   PHG1 caused a selective defect in phagocytosis of latex beads and
   Escherichia coli, but not Klebsiella aerogenes bacteria. This defect in
   phagocytosis was caused by a decrease in the adhesion of mutant cells to
   phagocytosed particles. These results indicate that the Phg1 protein is
   involved in the adhesion of Dictyostelium to various substrates, a
   crucial event of phagocytosis and demonstrate the usefulness of a
   genetic approach to dissect the molecular events involved in the

Abstract = {{The protein uptake equilibrium and particle morphology are determined
   for novel polymeric ion-exchange media based on acrylamido monomers with
   a high density of functional groups and a variety of morphological
   characteristics. The study considers two anion-exchangers and a
   cation-exchanger. Physical properties determined experimentally include
   particle density, ion-exchange capacity, particle size distribution, and
   equilibrium isotherms for model proteins. The pore structure was
   evaluated using size exclusion chromatography with neutral probe
   molecules and transmission electron microscopy. For the
   anion-exchangers, two types of structures were inferred. The first is
   comprised of particles that contain a low-density gel supported by
   denser polymer aggregates. This material had a very low size-exclusion
   limit for neutral probes, but exhibited an extremely high and reversible
   protein adsorption capacity (280-290 mg BSA/ml). The second structure is
   comprised of particles with large, open macropores. While the
   size-exclusion limit was very high, the protein adsorption capacity was
   low (60 mg BSA/ml). Moreover, the adsorption was nearly irreversible.
   The physical structure of the cation-exchanger appeared to be
   intermediate between those of the anion-exchangers, containing both
   large pores and smaller pores yielding an intermediate, but reversible,
   protein uptake capacity (120-130 mg alpha CHY/ml). The different
   behavior of these materials with regards to protein adsorption
   correlates well with their physical structure. For these ion-exchangers,
   high protein adsorption capacities are attained when a low-density
   polymer gel with a high concentration of functional groups is present.

Abstract = {{In present study, we investigated the immunohistochemical distribution
   of somatostatin (SRIF) in the hippocampal complex of the Mongolian
   gerbil and its association with different sequelae of spontaneous
   seizures, in an effort to identify the roles of SRIF in the
   self-recovery mechanisms in these animals. In the dentate gyrus and
   subiculum, SRIF immunoreactive (SRIF+) cells were similar in both the
   seizure resistant and the pre-seizure group of seizure sensitive
   gerbils. Interestingly, SRIF immunoreactivity was markedly decreased
   until 12 h postictal. Twenty-four hours after the on-set of seizure, the
   distribution of SRIF immunoreactivity in these regions had slightly
   increased. In contrast, in the entorhinal cortex the population of SRIF+
   cells and their density were significantly elevated compared to
   pre-seizure group 30 min postictal. Twelve hours after the on-set of
   seizure, however, the population of SRIF+ cells and their density
   declined, approximately 70-80\% compared to the situation at 30 min
   postictal. These findings suggest that the enhancement of SRIF
   expression in gerbil entorhinal cortex may affect tissue excitability
   and have a role in modulating recurrent excitation following seizures.

Abstract = {{Among a selected group of mouse strains susceptible to dietary obesity,
   those with an enhanced capacity for Ucp1 and brown adipocyte induction
   in white fat preferentially lost body weight following adrenergic
   stimulation. Eased on the generality of this mechanism for reducing
   obesity, a genetic analysis was initiated to identify genes that control
   brown adipocyte induction in white fat depots in mice, Quantitative
   trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed using the variations of
   retroperitoneal fat Ucp1 mRNA expression in progeny of genetic crosses
   between the A/J and C57BL/6J parental strains and selected AXE
   recombinant inbred strains. Three A/J-derived loci on chromosomes 2, 3,
   and 8 and one C57BL/6J locus on chromosome 19 were linked to Ucp1
   induction in retroperitoneal fat. Although A/J-derived alleles seemed to
   contribute to elevated Ucp1 expression, the C57BL/6J allele on
   chromosome 19 increased Ucp1 mRNA to levels higher than parental values.
   Thus, novel patterns of C57BL/6J and A/J recombinant genotypes among the
   four mapped loci resulted in a transgressive variation of Ucp1
   phenotypes, Although the extent, of the interchromosomal interactions
   have not been fully explored, strong synergistic interactions occur
   between a C57BL/6J allele on chromosome 19 and an A/J allele on
   chromosome a In addition to selective synergistic interactions between
   loci, variations in recessive and dominant effects also contribute to
   the final levels of Ucp1 expression.}},

Abstract = {{Cell surface gangliosides have been proposed as modulators of
   transmembrane signaling. In this study, we used two complementary
   approaches to investigate the function of cellular gangliosides in the
   response of mammalian fibroblasts to growth factors. First, inhibition
   of glucosyl ceramide synthase by a new specific inhibitor of
   D-1-threo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol-HCl
   (glucosylceramide synthase), which depletes cellular gangliosides at a
   concentration of 1 muM without causing an increase in ceramide levels,
   blocked epidermal growth factor-stimulated proliferation of fibroblasts.
   Similarly, responses to several other growth factors that activate
   receptor tyrosine kinases, including fibroblast growth factor,
   insulin-like growth factor-I, and platelet-derived growth factor, were
   inhibited by 50-100\%. Conversely, enrichment of cellular gangliosides
   by preincubation of the mouse and human fibroblasts with exogenously
   added gangliosides enhanced growth factor-elicited cell proliferation.
   Novel findings of this study, distinguishing it from previous similar
   studies, include differential effects of preincubation versus continuous
   incubation of cells with gangliosides on growth factor-dependent cell
   proliferation and the growth factor-like action of NeuNAc alpha2-3Gal
   beta1-3GalNAc beta1-4(NeuNAc alpha2-3)Gal beta1-4Glc beta1-1Cer when

Abstract = {{In greenhouse tomato crops, several manual operations are performed each
   week to keep the plants in optimal growth conditions. But growers are
   trying to reduce labour costs by spacing out the manual operations. An
   experimental study was conducted on one particular operation, axillary
   bud deshooting. The aim is to determine the effect of the deshooting
   frequency on vegetative growth and fruit yield, in order to help growers
   to determine the optimal frequency. The trials were conducted in an
   experimental station in Alenya (south France). Four deshooting
   frequencies were compared on two cultivars: every 7 (control), 10, 14
   and 21 days. Deshooting frequency affected both vegetative growth and
   yield: when deshooting was performed seldom (every 21 days), the stem
   diameter and the vigour scored by experts were decreased; the number of
   fruits per m(2) was also reduced, leading to a significantly lower
   yield. Moreover, the harvest started later than on the control. When the
   axillary buds were eliminated frequently (7 days), even those located
   near the apex, it reduced vegetative growth, but not yield. Therefore,
   from a biological point of view, the optimal deshooting frequency lies
   between 7 and 14 days, probably depending on climate, season and
   cultivar vigour. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC) is a most promising
   separation technique providing good selectivity and high separation
   efficiency of anionic, cationic as well as neutral solutes. In MEEKC
   lipophilic organic solvents dispersed as tiny droplets in an aqueous
   buffer by the use of surfactants provide a pseudo-stationary phase to
   which the solutes may have an affinity either to the surface or they may
   even partition into the droplets. When the droplets are charged,
   typically negatively, they will migrate opposite to the electroosmotic
   flow and hence separation of neutral solutes may take place. In the
   present paper focus has been set on how to change selectivity in MEEKC.
   Changes in the nature of surfactant as well as in pH have been shown to
   be powerful tools in changing the selectivity. The type of lipophilic
   organic phase is of less importance for the separation of fairly
   lipophilic solutes. Also changes in the temperature surrounding the
   capillary may alter the selectivity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},

Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{19-25}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous experimental work using in situ zymography has
   shown very early increased plasminogen activation in ischemic regions
   after 3 h of ischemia with and without reperfusion. The objective of the
   present study was to evaluate the time course and extent of plasminogen
   activation in long-term permanent focal cerebral ischemia. Material and
   methods: The middle cerebral artery in male Fisher rats was irreversibly
   occluded by electrocoagulation. Duration of ischemia was 48, 72, and 168
   h. Occlusion was controlled in vivo by MRI at day 2. Plasminogen
   activation was detected by in situ zymography of 10 mum cryosections
   with an overlay containing plasminogen and the plasmin substrate
   caseine. Areas of plasminogen activation were compared to structural
   lesions (immunohistochemical loss of microtubule-associated protein 2;
   MAP 2). Results: Compared to controls, increased plasminogen activation
   was observed in the basal ganglia and the cortex of the ischemic
   hemisphere after 48, 72, and 168 h (affected area of basal ganglia:
   44.5+/-21.9, 70.1+/-2.3 and 66.6+/-2.8\%, respectively; affected area of
   cortex: 63.4+/-9.8, 67.7+/-0.7 and 64.0+/-3.7\%, respectively). The
   duration of ischemia had no significant influence on the extent of
   plasminogen activation. Areas of increased plasminogen activation
   significantly overlapped with and exceeded areas of MAP 2 loss
   (P<0.005). Discussion: Permanent focal cerebral ischemia leads to
   increased plasminogen activation in ischemic regions. This plasminogen
   activation remains elevated at persistent levels over days. It may
   contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) disruption, secondary
   hemorrhage, and brain edema in subacute stages of ischemic stroke. (C)

Abstract = {{In the present paper we investigated the role of the noradrenergic
   projection from the locus coeruleus on the expression of the immediate
   early gene zif268 in the visual cortex of rats exposed to ambient light
   stimulation. Local administrations of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a
   specific toxin directed against the catecholaminergic system, were
   performed in the locus coerulens prior to visual stimulation. Animals
   were stimulated for 2 h by ambient light, after a 2-week dark adaptation
   period. Sham-operated controls displayed a massive increase in the
   number of zif268 positive cells after light stimulation. To the
   contrary, lesioned animals demonstrated a dramatic reduction in the
   number of zif268 positive nuclei across all cortical layers. A few
   scattered immunopositive nuclei were identified in cortical layer IV,
   however, this region also underwent a significant reduction in the
   number of zif268 immunopositive nuclei. Our results indicate that the
   noradrenergic system plays an important role in the expression of zif268
   in the visual cortex of rats exposed to ambient light after dark

Abstract = {{Presenilins are integral membrane protein involved in the production of
   amyloid beta -protein, Mutations of the presenilin-1 and -2 gene are
   associated with familial Alzheimer's disease and are thought to alter
   gamma -secretase cleavage of the beta -amyloid precursor protein,
   leading to increased production of longer and more amyloidogenic forms
   of A beta, the 4-kDa beta -peptide, Here, we show that radiolabeled
   gamma -secretase inhibitors bind to mammalian cell membranes, and a
   benzophenone analog specifically photocross-links three major membrane
   polypeptides. A positive correlation is observed among these compounds
   for inhibition of cellular A beta formation, inhibition of membrane
   binding and cross-linking. Immunological techniques establish N- and
   C-terminal fragments of presenilin-1 as specifically cross-linked
   polypeptides, Furthermore, binding of gamma -secretase inhibitors to
   embryonic membranes derived fi om presenilin-1 knockout embryos is
   reduced in a gene dose-dependent manner. In addition, C-terminal
   fragments of presenilin-2 are specifically cross-linked. Taken together,
   these results indicate that potent and selective gamma -secretase

Abstract = {{A comparative study has been undertaken on various strong
   anion-exchangers to investigate the pH dependence, titration curves,
   efficiency, binding strength, and dynamic capacity of the
   chromatographic resins. The resins tested included: Macro-Prep 25Q,
   TSK-Gel Q-5PW-HR, Poros QE/M, Q Sepharose FF, Q HyperD 20, Q Zirconia,
   Source 30Q, Fractogel EMD TMAE 650s, and Express-Ion Q. Testing was
   performed with five different proteins: Anti-FVII Mab (IgG), aprotinin,
   BSA, lipolase, and myoglobin. The dependence of pH on retention varies
   from generally low to very high for proteins with low pi. No direct link
   between pH dependence on retention and titration curves of the different
   resins Was observed. Efficiency results show the expected trend of lower
   dependence of the plate height with increasing flow-rate of resins for
   medium and high pressure operation compared to the soft resins. Binding
   to the anion-exchange resins as a function of ionic strength may vary
   depending on the specific protein. Generally, binding and elution at a
   high salt concentration may be performed with Poros QE/M or Macro-Prep
   254, while binding and elution at low salt concentration may be done
   with TSK-Gel Q-5PW. Dynamic capacities are strongly dependent on the
   specific protein employed and for some resins dependent on the
   flow-rate. A general good agreement was obtained between this study and
   data obtained by suppliers for the dynamic capacity. The results of this
   study may be used for selection of resins for testing in process
   development, however, the data does not tell anything about specific
   selectivity differences or resolution between a target protein and a
   given impurity. None of the resins studied here should be regarded as
   good or bad, but more or less suitable for a specific purpose, and only
   testing for the specific application will determine which one is the
   optimal resin. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   activity in the nigrostriatal pathway during
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced
   neurotoxicity. MPTP injected (30 mg/kg, i.p., twice, 16 h apart) mice
   were sacrificed on i, 2 and 7 days. DNA extracted from nucleus caudatus
   putamen (NCP) and substantia nigra (SN) was subjected to agarose gel
   electrophoresis. Typical apoptotic-like DNA cleavage was absent in SN or
   NCP after this dose of MPTP. A trypsin-like protease activity was
   significantly decreased in SN and not in NCP. While caspase-3 activity
   in the whole brain was increased significantly, caspase-1 activity was
   unaffected. Striatal dopamine content was decreased to 75\% by 7 days.
   The absence of typical DNA `ladder' when there was severe striatal
   dopamine depletion suggests that in vivo MPTP-mediated dopaminergic
   neurotoxicity may not involve apoptotic cell death, and explains why in
   mice MPTP-induced dopamine depletion is transient. The region-specific
   decrease in trypsin-like protease activity and absence of caspase-3
   activation in SN signify the importance of trypsin-like protease in the
   regulation of apoptosis in MPTP-neurotoxicity in mice. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Conformationally restricted phenalene and acenaphthene derivatives 5
   were synthesized from phenalen-1-one and acenaphthen-1-one derivatives
   using the Horner-Emmons reaction. The amines were prepared through the
   corresponding isocyanates by the Curtius reaction on the acids or by the
   reduction of the nitriles. Amido derivatives (R-3 = Me, Et, n-Pr, c-Pr)
   were prepared by acylation of the amines with the appropriate anhydrides
   or acid chlorides or by the reductive acylation of the nitriles. The
   affinities of the compounds for melatonin binding sites were evaluated
   in vitro in binding assays using chicken brain melatonin and the human
   mt(1) and MT2 receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells. The functionality of
   the compounds was determined by the potency to lighten the skin of
   Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Highly potent compounds were obtained. The data
   highlighted the role of the methoxy group located in the ortho position
   to the ethylamido chain as compounds with picomolar affinities such as
   14c were obtained (chicken brain, hmt(1), hMT(2) K-i values = 0.02,
   0.008, 0.069 nM, respectively). Compound 14c was equipotent to the
   corresponding dimethoxy derivative 15c (chicken brain, hmt(1), hMT(2)
   K-i values = 0.07, 0.016, 0.1 nM, respectively). On the other hand, the
   restricted conformation of the amido chain did not influence selectivity
   for the cloned hmt(1) and hMT(2) receptors. These compounds were also
   potent agonists of melanophore aggregation in X. laevis. 15a,c were
   several hundred fold more potent than melatonin (EC50 = 0.025, 0.004 nM,
   respectively). Conformational studies indicated that the minimum energy
   folded conformation of the ethylamido chain could constitute the
   putative active form in the receptor site in agreement; with previous
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Two small RNAs regulate the timing of Caenorhabditis elegans

   fates requires the 22-nucleotide lin-4 RNA(1,3,4), and transition from
   late larval to adult cell fates requires the 21-nucleotide let-7 RNA 2.
   The lin-4 and let-7 RNA genes are not homologous to each other, but are
   each complementary to sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of a set
   of protein-coding target genes that are normally negatively regulated by
   the RNAs1,2,5,6. Here we have detected let-7 RNAs of similar to 21
   nucleotides in samples from a wide range of animal species, including
   vertebrate, ascidian, hemichordate, mollusc, annelid and arthropod, but
   not in RNAs from several cnidarian and poriferan species, Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, Escherichia coli or Arabidopsis. We did not detect lin-4 RNA
   in these species. We found that let-7 temporal regulation is also
   conserved: let-7 RNA expression is first detected at late larval stages
   in C. elegans and Drosophila, at 48 hours after fertilization in
   zebrafish, and in adult stages of annelids and molluscs. The let-7
   regulatory RNA may control late temporal transitions during development

   stability}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between divalent metal ions and biomolecules are common
   both in solution and in the gas phase. Here, the intrinsic effect of
   divalent alkaline earth metal ions (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) on the structure
   of glycine in the absence of solvent is examined. Results from both
   density functional and Moller-Plesset theories indicate that for all
   metal ions except beryllium, the salt-bridge form of the ion, in which
   glycine is a zwitterion, is between 5 and 12 kcal/mol more stable than
   the charge-solvated structure in which glycine is in its neutral form.
   For beryllium, the charge-solvated structure is 5-8 kcal/mol more stable
   than the salt-bridge structure. Thus, there is a dramatic change in the
   structure of glycine with increased metal cation size. Using a
   Hartree-Fock-based partitioning method, the interaction between the
   metal ion and glycine is separated into electrostatic, charge transfer
   and deformation components. The charge transfer interactions are more
   important for stabilizing the charge-solvated structure of glycine with
   beryllium relative to magnesium. In contrast, the difference in
   stability between the charge-solvated and salt-bridge structure for
   magnesium is mostly due to electrostatic interactions that favor
   formation of the salt-bridge structure. These results indicate that
   divalent metal ions dramatically influence the structure of this
   simplest amino acid in the gas phase.}},

Title = {{Cut8, essential for anaphase, controls localization of 26S proteasome,
   facilitating destruction of cyclin and Cut2}},
Journal = {{CURRENT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{1329-1338}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anaphase-promoting complex (APC)/cyclosome and 26S
   proteasome are respectively required for polyubiquitination and
   degradation of mitotic cyclin and anaphase inhibitor Cut2
   (Pds1/securin). In fission yeast, mutant cells defective in cyclosome
   and proteasome fail to complete mitosis and have hypercondensed
   chromosomes and a short spindle. A similar phenotype is seen in a
   temperature-sensitive strain cut8-563 at 36 degreesC, but the molecular
   basis for Cut8 function is little understood.
   Results: At high temperature, the level of Cut8 greatly increases and it
   becomes essential to the progression of anaphase. In cut8 mutants,
   chromosome mis-segregation and aberrant spindle dynamics occur, but
   cytokinesis takes place with normal timing, leading to the cut
   phenotype. This is due to the fact that destruction of mitotic cyclin
   and Cut? in the nucleus is dramatically delayed, though
   polyubiquitination of Cdc13 occurs in cut8 mutant. Cut8 is localized
   chiefly to the nucleus and nuclear periphery, a distribution highly
   similar to that of 26S proteasome. In cut8 mutant, however, 26S
   proteasome becomes mostly cytoplasmic, showing that Cut8 is needed for
   its proper localization.
   Conclusion: Cut8 is a novel evolutionarily conserved heat-inducible
   regulator. It facilitates anaphase-promoting proteolysis by recruiting
   26S proteasome to a functionally efficient nuclear location.}},

   were observed at starch concentrations below the minimum critical
   concentration for gelation of oxidised starch alone under the same
   conditions (similar to 32 wt\%). This behaviour is tentatively ascribed
   to thermodynamic incompatibility between the two polymers causing
   incipient precipitation of calcium pectinate within the gel network. (C)

Abstract = {{Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is a well-recognized complication of
   cyclosporine (CyA) therapy. Transplant recipients with this complication
   are frequently switched to tacrolimus, although this drug has also been
   implicated. We report a case of a renal transplant recipient who
   developed severe graft dysfunction due to biopsy-proven HUS after
   receiving CyA. Renal function and hemolytic parameters improved with
   discontinuation of the drug, but they deteriorated again after
   commencement of tacrolimus 15 days later. A second transplant biopsy
   demonstrated fresh lesions diagnostic of HUS. Hemolytic parameters
   resolved with discontinuation of tacrolimus. This is the first report of
   metachronous HUS being caused in a renal transplant by both CyA and
   tacrolimus. We therefore believe that caution should be exercised when
   using tacrolimus as rescue therapy in patients with CyA-induced HUS.}},

Abstract = {{Leukocytosis, a common laboratory finding, is most often due to
   relatively benign conditions (infections or inflammatory processes).
   Much less common but more serious causes include primary bone marrow
   disorders. The normal reaction of bone marrow to infection or
   inflammation leads to an increase in the number of white blood cells,
   predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes and less mature cell forms
   (the ``left shift{''}). Physical stress (e.g., from seizures, anesthesia
   or overexertion) and emotional stress can also elevate white blood cell
   counts. Medications commonly associated with leukocytosis include
   corticosteroids, lithium and beta agonists. Increased eosinophil or
   basophil counts, resulting from a variety of infections, allergic
   reactions and other causes, can lead to leukocytosis in some patients.
   Primary bone marrow disorders should be suspected in patients who
   present with extremely elevated white blood cell counts or concurrent
   abnormalities in red blood cell or platelet counts. Weight loss,
   bleeding or bruising, liver, spleen or lymph node enlargement, and
   immunosuppression also increase suspicion for a marrow disorder. The
   most common bone marrow disorders can be grouped into acute leukemias,
   chronic leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders. Patients with an
   acute leukemia are more likely to be ill al: presentation, whereas those
   with a chronic leukemia are often diagnosed incidentally because of
   abnormal blood cell counts. White blood cell counts above 100,000 per
   mm(3) (100 x 10(9) per L) represent a medical emergency because of the
   risk of brain infarction and hemorrhage.}},

Abstract = {{We have analyzed the molecular dynamics of emergence of drug-resistant
   strains in patients receiving lamivudine therapy for chronic hepatitis
   B. Twenty consecutive patients with lamivudine resistance were studied
   (13 hepatitis 8 e antigen {[}HBeAg]-positive patients and 7 HBe antibody
   {[}anti-HBe]-positive patients). Determination of viral genotype,
   precore mutants, and polymerase gene mutants (L528M, M552V, M552I) was
   performed using the research version of Lipa-HBV. Quantitative analysis
   of HBV DNA was performed using both branched DNA (bDNA) and polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) assays. Polymerase mutants (genotypic resistance)
   were found in 16 of 20 patients. Genotypic resistance was detected
   earlier than the phenotypic resistance (P = .004). Quantitative PCR
   allowed detection of viral DNA throughout the entire study period in 16
   of 20 patients. Analysis of pretreatment variables showed that high
   alanine transaminase (ALT) levels (>3 x the upper limit of normal
   {[}ULN]) was associated with a more rapid selection of drug-resistant
   mutants (P = .027) and a high hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level (>1,497
   Meq/mL, bDNA) with a more rapid occurrence of phenotypic resistance (P =
   .04), At the time of viral breakthrough, the mean serum HBV-DNA values
   were not different from the pretreatment values (P = .37). ALT levels
   were higher in anti-HBe-positive patients compared with pretreatment
   values and to HBeAg-positive patients (P = .01). In 8 patients,
   antiviral therapy was modified after viral breakthrough, with the
   introduction of famciclovir and/or interferon alfa. Viral DNA became
   undetectable by bDNA in 3 patients who received interferon. Our results
   suggest that genotypic assays for polymerase mutant detection and
   quantitative determination of viremia with highly sensitive assay are
   warranted for an optimal monitoring of antiviral therapy of chronic
   hepatitis B.}},

Abstract = {{Transfection of Rat1 fibroblasts with an activated form of rad (V12rac1)
   stimulated cell migration IN vitro compared to transfection of Rat1
   fibroblasts with vector only or with dominant negative rad (N17rac1). To
   investigate the involvement of proteases in this migration, we used a
   novel confocal assay to evaluate the ability of the Rat1 transfectants
   to degrade a quenched fluorescent protein substrate (DQ-green bovine
   serum albumin) embedded in a three-dimensional gelatin matrix. Cleavage
   of the substrate results in fluorescence, thus enabling one to image
   extracellular and intracellular proteolysis by living cells. The Rat1
   transfectants accumulated degraded substrate intracellularly. V1Srac1
   increased accumulation of the fluorescent product in vesicles that also
   labeled with the lysosomal marker LysoTracker. Treatment of the
   V12rac1-transfected cells with membrane-permeable inhibitors of
   lysosomal cysteine proteases and a membrane-permeable selective
   inhibitor of the cysteine protease cathepsin B significantly reduced
   intracellular accumulation of degraded substrate, indicating that
   degradation occurred intracellularly. V12rac1 stimulated uptake of
   dextran 70 (a marker of macropinocytosis) and polystyrene beads (markers
   of phagocytosis) into vesicles that also labeled for cathepsin B. Thus,
   stimulation of the endocytic pathways of macropinocytosis and
   phagocytosis by activated Rad may be responsible for the increased
   internalization and subsequent degradation of extracellular proteins.

Abstract = {{The mechanism causing the increasing number of peripheral T cells after
   highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is still unclear. The bcl-2
   oncogene prevents spontaneous apoptosis (SA) in lymphocytes. Spontaneous
   apoptosis could be a determinant of HIV immunodeficiency and can be
   reversed by HAART including protease inhibitors (PI-HAART). The aims of
   our study were to measure Bcl-2 protein expression in memory (CD45RO(+))
   and naive (CD45RO(-)) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes of HIV+ patients
   and to correlate it with efficacy of PI-HAART. Forty-nine HIV+ patients
   (cases) and 26 HIV- individuals (controls) were evaluated. Patients
   receiving PI-HAART, and who had undetectable HIV plasma viral load (VL-,
   n = 21), had higher levels of Bcl-2 than did VL+ patients (n = 28), both
   in CD4(+) cells (p<0.0001) and in CD8(+) cells (p < 0.001). VL+ patients
   had lower Bcl-2 levels than did controls in CD8(+) cells (p = 0.02), but
   not in CD4(+) cells (p>0.05). Interestingly, VL- patients had higher
   Bcl-2 expression than did controls both in CD4(+) cells (p<0.0001) and
   in CD8(+) cells (p = 0.03). In a subcohort of the same patients, Bcl-2
   was significantly higher in VL- patients (n = 10) than in controls (n =
   12), both in naive CD4(+) cells (p<0.0001) and in naive CD8(+) cells (p
   = 0.01). Naive CD4(+) cells had higher Bcl-2 expression in VL- than in
   VL+ patients (p = 0.01). In a subsequent longitudinal study of nine HIV
   patients, naive CD4(+) cells increased after effective PI-HAART (p =
   0.03), which paralleled an increase in Bcl-2 expression in the same
   cells (p = 0.02). In conclusion, upregulation of bcl-2 could be a
   mechanism of immune reconstitution of naive CD4(+) T cells induced by
   PI-HAART.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. The passing of the Prevention of Industrial Risks Act, in
   force from 9 February 1996 has altered previous ideas on the subject,
   which is currently considered to be of utmost importance for national
   and community legislation. Development. In this article we describe the
   preventive functions of the Mutual Aid Societies for Industrial
   Accidents and professional diseases of the National Health Service. We
   have analysed the current legislation so as to clarify the activities of
   the Mutual Aid Societies in the field of the prevention of industrial
   accidents, and hale defined the actions which may be taken in this field
   according to the present laws. Two different types of preventive
   activities are considered: (1) Those which depend on contributions,
   included in the professional risks cover, and which are obliged to
   prepare an annual plan of the measures taken to prevent industrial
   accidents and professional illness, following the guidelines established
   by the Ministry of labor and Social Services and according to certain
   priorities. (2) The functions corresponding to the services for
   third-party prevention exclusively for their associated companies when
   the Mutual Aid Society is approved as a service for third party cover.
   This requires a voluntary or professional contract and the financial
   cost is borne by the company which requests it. Conclusion. The
   objective of the current legislation is, amongst other things, to
   introduce the new preventive approach established by the Prevention of
   Industrial Risks Act in the workplace and through the Mutual Aid
   Societies as well as to foment a new culture of prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers at anthesis from the apricot cvs Palstein and Goldrich were
   examined to determine their ovule maturity stage. Further, flowers from
   both cultivars were pollinated and collected after 2000 and 3000 growing
   degree hours (GDH) in two consecutive years. Numbers of fertilized
   ovules were recorded in those flowers. Ovules of `Palstein' from flowers
   at anthesis showed predominantly an embryo sac at the eight nuclei stage
   of development while embryo sacs in `Goldrich' were mainly in a four
   nuclei stage. After 2000 GDH from pollination 90\% of viable ovules were
   fertilized in `Palstein' whereas only 37.5\% of them were fertilized in
   `Goldrich'. After 3000 GDH, Goldrich presented the same percentage of
   fertilized ovules that was recorded after 2000 GDH. Non-fertilized
   ovules did not degenerate and developed normally in pollinated and
   non-pollinated flowers from both cultivars. Further, non-fertilized
   pollinated flowers were not different from non-pollinated flowers in the
   development of the embryo sac, indicating that the chances for
   fertilization would not be increased by pollination in apricot. We
   suggest that the lack of fertilization in `Goldrich' is due to
   degeneration of the male gametophyte, which would have a limited life,
   not long enough for the embryo sacs to develop to maturity.}},

Abstract = {{Isolates of Phytophthora from pepper, produced in Tunisia, were
   characterised according to molecular and pathogenicity criteria.
   Polymerase chain reaction amplification of the ITS1 region in the
   ribosomal DNA resulted in different sized fragments. The pepper isolated
   and P nicotianae yielded a fragment of 310 bp that distinguished it from
   P. capsici with a fragment of 270 bp. The ribosomal RNA gene amplicons
   of both internal transcribed spacers and the 5.8 S of the pepper
   Phytophthora and nicotianae were digested with 8 endonucleases. The
   patterns generated, with the 2 enzymes that cut, were identical for both
   taxa. This molecular analysis corroborated the morphological and
   biological characteristics and suggests strongly that the isolates of
   Phytophthora from pepper belong to the species P. nicotianae.
   Inoculation of pepper, tomato, eggplant and tobacco plants with the
   isolates of Fl nicotianae from pepper showed they were highly pathogenic
   on pepper but not on tobacco, while their pathogenicity was weak on
   tomato and eggplant and was associated with atypical symptoms not
   observed in the field. These pathogenicity tests suggest that pepper
   isolates of P. nicotianae are particularly adapted to their host and may
   thus constitute a forma specialis of P. nicotianae.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Prophylactic antibiotics are routinely administered to
   patients with external ventricular drains (EVDs); however, no conclusive
   evidence supports this practice. This study compared the efficacy and
   cost of prophylactic and periprocedural antibiotics in patients with
   EVDs.
   METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 308 patients who had an EVD in place
   for 3 or move days between January 1996 and lune 1997. Patients with
   EVDs placed for shunt infections or meningitis were excluded. A standard
   protocol was used to insert and monitor EVDs. Catheters were left in
   place as long as clinically indicated and changed only if they
   malfunctioned, Cerebrospinal fluid cultures were obtained twice weekly.
   Prophylactic antibiotics were used at the discretion of the attending
   neurosurgeon. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A comprised
   209 patients who received prophylactic antibiotics for the duration of
   the EVD (intravenously administered cefuroxime, 1.5 g every 8 h); Group
   B comprised 99 patients who received only periprocedural antibiotics
   (intravenously administered cefuroxime, 1.5 g every 8 h, three or less
   doses).
   RESULTS: Although there were significantly more males in Group A than in
   Group B, the two groups were otherwise well matched, with no significant
   differences in age, indications, or duration of EVD placement. The
   overall rate of ventriculitis was 3.9\%. The infection rates for Group A
   (3.8\%) and Group 8 (4.0\%) were almost identical.
   CONCLUSION: Prophylactic antibiotics did not significantly reduce the
   rate of ventriculitis in patients with EVDs, and they may select for
   resistant organisms. Discontinuing the use of prophylactic antibiotics
   for EVDs at the authors' institution would save approximately \$80,000
   per year in direct drug costs.}},

   Intervention. Surveys were distributed to members of the American
   Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists during 1999.
   Participants. Of 6200 members to whom surveys mailed, 1504 (24.3\%)
   responded.
   Measurements and Main Results. Of these respondents, 114 (7.6\%) perform
   office laparoscopy and 187 (12.4\%) microlaparoscopy.
   Conclusion. Clinicians who perform office laparoscopy are more likely to
   perform microlaparoscopy than macro-laparoscopy. The 2-mm
   microlaparoscope is preferred by most physicians.}},

Abstract = {{The granitoids of Marajoara in the Rio Maria terrain (Carajas Mineral
   Province, Brazil) consist of: (i) a broad unit of 2.96 Ga syntectonic
   tonalites (Arco Verde Tonalites) displaying a trondhjemitic
   differentiation trend; (ii) 2.93 Ga syntectonic monzogranites
   (Guaranta); and (iii) 2.87 Ga post-tectonic monzogranites (Mata Surrao)
   and granodiorites (Rio Maria), displaying a calc-alkaline
   differentiation trend. Deformation of the Arco Verde tonalites is
   heterogeneous with low strain domains (well preserved magmatic banding
   and textures) and orthogneissic domains displaying an E-W trending
   mainly subvertical foliation, associated with horizontal lineations,
   upright folds and subvertical shear zones. Microstructures and phase
   assemblages suggest that deformation occurred within a large temperature
   range (i.e. during magma emplacement and cooling), from high-T
   conditions (synmagmatic shear zones and subsolidus ductile deformation
   with intense quartz and feldspar recrystallization; Pl + Qtz + Hbl + Bt
   assemblages) to medium- and low-T conditions (ductile to brittle
   deformation with weakly recrystallized quartz and undulose extinction in
   feldspars; Qtz + Pl + Bt + Mu or Chi + Ep + Ab i Qtz assemblages). These
   data, finite strain analysis and structures reported from the
   surrounding greenstone belts suggest that deformation did not result
   from a post-emplacement prograde tectono-metamorphic event as considered
   previously, but that the Marajoara granitoids are synkinernatic
   intrusions which were deformed together with the supracrustal rocks
   during a regional NS horizontal shortening. Although the Rio Maria
   terrain presents similarities with Archaean domains controlled by
   diapiric processes (lithologies dominated by thick greenstone sequences
   and TTG plutons, and forming a dome-and-keel structure), its structural
   evolution is controlled dominantly by a transpressional event which
   shaped the granite-greenstone terrains. The Rio Maria area, probably as
   many Archaean `grey gneisses' domains, represents an intermediate case
   between terrains controlled by Raleigh-Taylor instabilities in a
   thermally softened crust with insignificant external forces related to
   plate convergence (e.g. east Pilbara craton) and those controlled by
   thrust tectonics related to convergence of rigid plates (e.g. Superior
   Province). The closest analog to the Rio Maria terrain seems to be the
   Chilimanzi area in the Zimbabwe craton. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the role of the cytokine-induced neutrophil
   chemoattractant (CINC) in chronic bronchopulmonary infection, we
   developed a rat model of bronchopulmonary infection with Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa by using the agar bead method, and determined the kinetics of
   bacterial and cell number, as well as the concentrations of CINC-1,
   CINC-2, and CINC-3 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids in this model.
   The bacterial number in the lung rapidly increased from days 1 to 4, and
   declined 14 days after challenge. Neutrophil number in BAL fluid
   increased up to one day after challenge, and then slowly decreased
   during 14 days post-challenge, Among the CINCs, the local production of
   CINC3 alpha sharply increased at day 1 and then decreased until day 4
   post-challenge, while the local production of CINC-1 slightly increased
   at day 1 post-challenge. Neither CINC-2 beta nor CINC-3 were detected
   during the entire course of the infection. Increased CINC-2 mRNA
   expression in the lung tissue after challenge was associated with CLNC-2
   alpha production in BAL fluid, Moreover, an immunohistochemical study
   demonstrated the localization of CINC-1 and CINC-2 alpha primarily in
   alveolar macrophages and, to a much lesser extent, in bronchial
   epithelium of infected lung tissues, whereas CINC-2 beta and CINC-3 were
   not detected. When anti-CINC-1 or anti-CINC-2 alpha polyclonal
   antibodies were used for neutralizing neutrophil chemotactic activities
   in BAL fluids, the anti-CINC-2 alpha antibody inhibited 70\% of the
   chemotactic activity in BAL fluids from infected rats at day 1 after
   challenge. No inhibition was observed by anti-CINC-1 antibody. These
   data indicate that CINC-2 alpha, which is produced by alveolar
   macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, plays a pivotal role in
   neutrophil accumulation in the airway of a rat model of chronic
   bronchopulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To collect statistically significant information on patterns
   of antihypertensive therapy in medical practice, with particular
   attention to the drugs used in the pharmacological management of
   hypertensive patients and the reasons for the limited achievement of
   therapeutic goals during treatment.
   Design A survey conducted among general practitioners, specialists, and
   hypertensive patients.
   Methods A total of 28 000 physicians were contacted by letter and 3394
   declared their willingness to participate and received a questionnaire.
   Subsequently, 1255 questionnaires suitable for analysis (corresponding
   to 37.0\% of adhering physicians) were received. In addition, 4612
   questionnaires completed by patients were pooled and evaluated. The
   prevalence of hypertension was calculated from a base of 254192
   patients, seen by general practitioners.
   Results The prevalence of hypertension, defined as systolic blood
   pressure greater than or equal to 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure
   greater than or equal to 95 mmHg, or current treatment, was 19.7\%. The
   average number of hypertensive patients in each general practitioner's
   file, covering the previous 12 months, was approximately 230. Physicians
   reported a 66\% rate of discontinuation of treatment or switching to
   another drug. Physicians and patients both considered inadequate blood
   pressure control and side effects to be the two main reasons for
   switching antihypertensive therapy, but in opposite order. Furthermore,
   physicians indicated a prevalence of drug side effects between 10 and
   20\%, according to class of drug used, whereas 69\% of patients reported
   to have experienced side effects. In the doctors' opinions, there were
   many reasons for poor patient adherence: complexity of the drug regimen,
   appearance of side effects, forgetfulness, reduced patient understanding
   of the need for long-term continuation of treatment, and refusal to
   accept a chronic pathological condition.
   Conclusions The survey showed awareness of the disease among physicians
   and provides a representation of the experiences of both general
   practitioners and specialists, in addition to that of their patients.
   During antihypertensive therapy, a disconcerting degree of
   discontinuation and switching of drugs occurred. Insufficient blood
   pressure control and side effects accounted for most of the observed
   treatment changes. This survey revealed the existence of a gap between
   the physicians' perception of tolerability and the real experience of
   patients, a clear need for greater tolerability of treatments, and a
   need for an enhancement of patient-physician communication. J Hypertens

Abstract = {{The finding of new individuals of a clonal plant, Juncus gerardi, raised
   the question of modalities for the colonization of new sites by this
   species. Indeed, the existence of seedlings has not been observed in the
   field, nor reported in the literature for European marshes. Among the
   parameters limiting recruitment, we examined the soil seed bank, which
   appeared extremely small. Many seeds could be found in bovine feces but
   few were found in equine feces. Futhermore, bovines are not only
   important for seed dispersion, but also for the improvement of the
   germinative capacities: the seed germination rate of Juncus gerardi was
   doubled after digestive transit. Germination testing showed that this
   species is largely tolerant to salinity (from 0 to 26,4 mS.cm(-1)). The
   germination rate was maximal with a thermoperiod of 10-20 degreesC but
   null for a 0-10 degreesC thermoperiod. Germination was improved by
   immersion and was light dependent. The critical phase for colonization
   success in new habitats could be primarily seedling survival.
   Recruitment success in Juncus gerardi seems to be a rare event,
   requiring the combination of favorable conditions related to climate and
   gap openings in swards.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium-based bulk amorphous alloys with a diameter of 7 mm for
   Mg65Y10Cu15Ag5Pd5 were produced by a metallic mold casting method. The
   glass transition temperature (T-g), crystallization temperature (T-x),
   the temperature interval of the supercooled liquid region (DeltaT(x) =
   T-x - T-g) and the melting temperature (T-m) are measured to be 437,
   472, 35 and 707 K, respectively, for the Mg65Y10Cu15Ag5Pd5 alloy. The
   simultaneous addition of Ag and Pd to Mg-Y-Cu system causes a steep
   decrease in T-m and an increase in the reduced glass transition
   temperature (T-g/T-m), leading to an increase in the glass-forming
   ability. The Mg-Y-Cu-(Ag, Pd) hulk amorphous alloys have a high
   compressive fracture strength of 770 MPa. The simultaneous addition of
   Ag and Pd is useful for the improvements or glass-forming ability and

Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{69-98}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Crop growth models can be useful tools in evaluating the impacts of
   different tillage systems on the growth and final yield of crops. A
   tillage model was incorporated into CROP-GRO-Soybean and tested for
   conditions in Ames, IA, USA. Predictions of changes in surface residue,
   bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, runoff curve number, and surface
   albedo were consistent with expected behaviors of these parameters as
   described in the literature. For conditions at Ames, IA, the model gave
   good predictions of soil temperature at 6 cm depth under moldboard (R-2
   = 0.81), chisel plow (R-2 = 0.72), and no-till (R-2 = 0.81) for 1997 and
   was able to simulate cooler soil temperatures and delayed emergence
   under no-till in early spring. However, measured differences in soil
   temperature under the three tillage treatments were not statistically
   significant. Excellent predictions of soybean phenology and biomass
   accumulation (e.g. R-2=0.98, 0.97, and 0.95 for pod weight predictions
   under moldboard, chisel plow, and no-till, respectively) were obtained
   in 1997. More importantly, the model satisfactorily predicted relative
   differences in soybean growth components (canopy height, leaf weight,
   stem weight, canopy weight, pod weight, and number of nodes) among
   tillage treatments for critical vegetative and reproductive stages in
   one season. The tillage model was further tested using weather and
   soybean yield data from 1995 to 1997 at Nashua, IA. Tillage systems
   considered were no-till, disk-chisel+field cultivator, and moldboard
   plow + field cultivator. Predicted yields for the 1996 calibration year
   were within 1.3\% of the measured yields for all three tillage
   treatments. The model gave adequate yield predictions for the no-till
   (-0.2 3.9\% errors), disk-chisel (5.8-6.9\% errors), and moldboard
   (5.5-6.1\% errors) tillage treatments for the two years of validation. A
   sensitivity analysis showed that predicted soybean yield and canopy
   weight were only slightly sensitive to the tillage parameters (less than
   3\% change with 30\% change in tillage parameters). The model predicted
   lower yields under no-till for nine out of 10 years of weather at Ames,
   IA, primarily due to delayed emergence. Yield under no-till was higher
   for one of the years (a drought year) when no-till had better water
   conservation and negligible delays in emergence. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   showed a complex reactivity behavior for the material, dependent

   agreement with previous measurements for fully-dense CPM-Be. Rates for
   the Be pebbles, based on measured BET surface areas, were systematically

Abstract = {{Educators have long considered assigning a grade in the assessment of
   student clinical practice performance as too variable, too subjective,
   or educationally inappropriate. Consequently, most undergraduate nurse
   education programs have maintained non-graded pass/fail criteria
   assessment for evaluating and reporting student clinical performance.
   This paper argues that, while the varied clinical environments do make
   assessing students' clinical performance difficult, the reliability and
   validity of assessment practices should be maintained no matter what the
   grading system. Furthermore, many assumptions about criterion-referenced
   assessment, and the associated preclusion of graded assessment, are seen
   to be baseless when dealing with competencies rather than with
   traditional behavioural objectives. By combining both
   criterion-referenced and norm-referenced assessment, graded assessment
   can clarify and impress on students the minimal competency requirements,
   while at the same time describing and rewarding meritorious practice. It
   is argued that to do so would provide a more appropriate way of
   communicating the assessment of theory application in praxis, a highly
   relevant issue in a practice-based discipline such as nursing. It is now
   appropriate to reconsider the debate of graded student clinical
   performance assessments, and to investigate both the practicalities and
   benefits of this approach. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.}},

Title = {{Acute primary angle closure in an Asian population - Long-term outcome
   of the fellow eye after prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomy}},
Journal = {{OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To study the long-term outcome of fellow eyes of Asian patients
   with acute primary angle closure (APAC) who underwent prophylactic laser
   peripheral iridotomy (LPI).
   Design: Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.
   Participants: Ninety-six consecutive patients with APAC at presentation
   to one Singapore hospital from January 1990 through December 1994.
   Methods: The presenting features of the fellow eye were recorded, and
   the subsequent long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) outcome after LPI
   was analyzed. All fellow eyes were initially treated with pilocarpine
   2\% eyedrops four times daily before LPI, which was performed within 1
   week of presentation. For any eye, a rise in IOP during follow-up was
   defined as a rise in IOP requiring treatment by medication or surgery.
   Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of acute angle closure and IOP.
   Results: The mean follow-up period was 50.8 months (range, 9-99 months).
   Of the 96 patients, 15 patients had bilateral APAC, and APAC developed
   in one fellow eye before LPI could be performed. The remaining 80 fellow
   eyes were studied. No cases of APAC developed after prophylactic LPI.
   Seventy-one fellow eyes (88.8\%) were successfully treated with LPI
   alone without the need for additional glaucoma treatment in the long
   term. Seven eyes (8.8\%) had IOPs of 21 mmHg or less on presentation,
   but a rise in IOP developed on follow-up despite the presence of a
   patent LPI. Two fellow eyes (2.5\%) had signs of preexisting chronic
   angle closure glaucoma at presentation and required further glaucoma
   treatment even after LPI. There were no significant complications from
   the procedure in any of the fellow eyes studied.
   Conclusions: In this Asian population with APAC, prophylactic LPI is
   safe and effective in preventing acute angle closure in fellow eyes. In
   addition, prophylactic LPI prevents long-term rise in IOP in 88.8\% of
   fellow eyes (with approximately 4 years of follow-up). However, because
   a small proportion of fellow eyes did experience a rise in IOP within
   the first year, despite the presence of a patent LPI, close monitoring
   is still advised in the follow-up of fellow eyes of patients with APAC.

Abstract = {{The taxonomic composition of the present-day benthic foraminifers in
   Pos'et Bay (Sea of Japan) was studied using 60 samples of the surface
   deposits. Fifty-one species of benthic foraminifers belonging to 32
   genera were identified, and the patterns of benthic foraminiferal
   distribution were analyzed depending on such abiotic factors as the
   roughness of the coastline, the degree of closure of the bay water
   areas, the type of the bottom sediments, as well as the depth,
   near-bottom water temperature, and the influence of the riverine runoff.
   The zones with high bioproductivity were recognized, and the species
   diversity was assessed. Four types and five subtypes of benthic
   foraminiferal assemblages corresponding to certain depths, bottom
   temperatures, deposit structures, and types of bay water area were
   recognized with respect to the prevailing abundance of the dominant
   species and the ratio between the subdominant and accessory species. The
   benthic foraminiferal assemblages from the upper littoral zone differ
   from those living in the bay water area.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 6 wk of
   essential amino acid (EAA) supplementation on body composition and
   exercise performance in untrained women (n = 21). Subjects were randomly
   assigned to a placebo (cellulose) or an EAA (average daily dose of 18.3
   g of EAAs in pill form) group. Each subject participated in aerobic and
   heavy-resistance training three times per week. Body composition was
   assessed via dual x-ray absorptiometry analysis. Muscular endurance was
   determined via treadmill time to exhaustion, and strength was assessed
   by the total amount of weight lifted for one set to exhaustion at an
   estimated 12 repetitions maximum. No changes occurred in either group
   for bodyweight, lean body mass, fat mass, or bone mineral content.
   Treadmill time to exhaustion (TTE) improved significantly (P < 0.05) in
   the EAA group (meant +/- SD; pre-TTE = 13.15 +/- 3.67 min, post-TTE =
   14.73 +/- 4.26 min), whereas the placebo group did not change
   significantly. The total weight lifted at the subject's maximum 12
   repetitions did not significantly change in either group. In previously
   untrained individuals, the ingestion of EAAs combined with aerobic and
   heavy-resistance training for 6 wk did not have a significant effect on
   body composition or muscular strength; however, aerobic muscular
   endurance increased significantly. (C)Elsevier Science Inc. 2000.}},

Abstract = {{The reactions between silylene, H2Si, and the three-membered ring
   compounds, oxirane (9), thiirane (10), and selenirane (11), which
   provide possible routes to Si=X (X = O, S, Se) double bonds were studied
   by ab initio calculations at the MP2 and QCISD correlated levels of
   theory employing the polarized 6-31G{*}{*} basis set. The calculations
   show that the three reactions are all highly exothermic, (-61.8, -45.2,
   -52.9 kcal/mol at MP2/6-31G{*}{*}//MP2/6-31G{*}{*} for X = O, S, Se,
   respectively). In the gas phase, at 0 K, these reactions are predicted
   to be also spontaneous (i.e., the calculated transition states are lower
   in energy than the reactants). At 298 K, entropy contributions result in
   small barriers on the DeltaG surface for X = O, S (7.4 kcal/mol for both
   reactions at QCISD (full)/6-31G{*}{*}), but for X = Se the reaction
   remains spontaneous. Thus, the calculations suggest that these reactions
   are viable routes for the preparation of compounds with Si=X (X = O, S,
   Se) double bonds. The first step in all the reactions is the
   barrier-less formation of an encounter-complex between the silylene and
   the X atom of the precursor. For X = O, S, these complexes are predicted
   to be sufficiently stable to be observed in a matrix. The reaction steps
   which follow depend on X; for X = O fragmentation of the silylene-XC2H4
   complex proceeds in two steps via a biradical intermediate, while for X
   = S and X = Se the fragmentation occurs in a single step. The first ab
   initio calculations for H2Si=Se are reported.}},

Abstract = {{The anthropological study of kirikirimasien (epilepsy) in Mali
   constitutes an integral part of a research programme devoted to the
   epidemiology of epilepsy and onchocerciasis in Mali. This programme is
   run jointly by scientists of the Ecole Nationale de Medecine et de
   Pharmacie (National School of Medicine and Pharmacy) of Bamako, Mali,
   and the Faculte de Medecine (Faculty of Medicine) of Marseilles, France.
   Preliminary results of the anthropological study are presented, based on
   the qualitative analysis of 132 interviews, conducted over 6 months.
   Those interviewed were mainly persons affected by kirikirimasien, but
   included members of the family circle, traditional healers and outsiders
   as well. Participatory interview techniques used the national language
   bambara. The interviews were unstructured and semi-structured so as to
   identify themes in the bambara language concerning kirikirimasien. Two
   dominant trends were identified, concerning the aetiology and nosography
   of the disease, and the social dimension of kirikirimasien,
   respectively.
   In terms of aetiology and nosography diagnosis, contamination and
   appelation are - in order of priority - the most important aspects of
   the disease.
   Yet the social dimension of kirikirimasien appears largely to surpass
   its aetiological and nosographic aspects. The social dimension is
   crucial to the anthropological understanding of kirikirimasien. This was
   amply illustrated by various references which arose during the
   interviews. First how is the notion of contamination represented and
   which practices are associated with it? Second invalidity and handicap
   appear to play an essential role in the way people deal with the
   disease, The notion of tolerance in the bambara environment is also
   addressed mainly through a spatial study of the adherence of the person
   affected by the disease (family village and outsiders). The third part
   of the study deals with the social understanding of k rikirimasien and
   looks at how those affected are cared for both within their social
   setting and in terms of seeking treatment.}},

Abstract = {{In the past years several successful experimental studies have proven
   the suitability of synchrotron light in the field of medical radiology
   and in diagnostic medical imaging. To be mentioned and reviewed in the
   following are transvenous coronary angiography with synchrotron
   radiation, bronchography, single- or multi-energy tomography and
   synchrotron radiation-based mammography. Amongst those the most
   demanding application is X-ray mammography. Here, a dedicated system has
   to fulfil the demanding requirements on the source and the X-ray
   detector. Synchrotron radiation-based mammography, which enables
   improved image quality maintaining a low dose level, takes advantage of
   the tunable monochromatic energy and of the peculiar laminar geometry of
   the beam. In addition, further improvements can be achieved with the
   development of novel detectors for full-field digital mammography in
   order to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the conventional
   screen-film systems. Encouraging results in digital mammography have
   been obtained at the medical beamline of the synchrotron radiation
   facility ELETTRA, Trieste. Besides, the high degree of the spatial
   coherence of the synchrotron source allows new imaging modalities based
   on phase contrast effects that produce superior radiographs featuring
   highly enhanced contrast with a low delivered dose. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{N-Nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) is carcinogenic in rodents and undergoes
   alpha -hydroxylation upon microsomal CYP450 metabolism, giving rise to
   mutations. Previously, we reported the direct mutagenicity of NPYR,
   under ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation, towards Salmonella typhimurium
   and phage M13mp2. In the present study, we measured the formation of
   8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) in a replicative form of
   M13mp2 DNA exposed to NPYR plus WA. Formation of
   5-hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidine in calf thymus DNA treated with NPYR plus UVA
   was also observed. Singlet oxygen is likely to account for the formation
   of 8-oxodGuo, We analyzed the spectrum of mutations in lacZ alpha of
   M13mp2 phages produced on transfecting Escherichia coli with the
   replicative form of phage DNA that had been treated with NPYR plus UVA.
   The role of oxidative DNA damage in mutagenesis was explored using
   mutM-proficient and -deficient E.coli strains as the hosts. A higher
   level of mutation was observed with the mutM-deficient host than with
   the -proficient host. Base substitutions at GC pairs predominated in
   both mutM-proficient and -deficient hosts. With the mutM-deficient host,
   we observed an overall increase in the percentage of GC-->TA
   transversions. In addition we noted that there were fewer GC-->AT
   transitions than in the mutM-proficient host. With these hosts,
   different hot spots were observed and a new GC-->TA hot spot was
   produced. The formation of 8-oxodGuo in DNA, which is known to induce
   GC-->TA transversion, may contribute to mutagenesis by NPYR plus UVA.}},

Abstract = {{High medical utilization in adults has been linked to both reported
   history of childhood abuse and mental health problems. However, few
   studies have explored relationships between abuse severity and
   psychological distress to identify subgroups with unique utilization
   patterns and medical complaints. This study compared two groups of
   psychologically distressed, high utilizers. One group (DS) was comprised
   of those with psychological distress, who reported a history of child
   sexual abuse (CSA); the other group (DSP) consisted of those with
   psychological distress, who reported CSA plus a history of childhood
   physical abuse. The groups were compared on severity of sexual and
   nonsexual child maltreatment. medical complaints and medical
   utilization. From a convenience sample of 206 females age 20-63,
   recruited while waiting for a physician appointment in a primary care
   clinic, we compared 25 DSPs to 33 DSs. Compared with DSs, DSPs reported
   significantly more severe: (1) sexual abuse including completed
   intercourse; (7) emotional abuse; (3) emotional neglect; and (4)
   psychological distress. DSPs also showed a nonsignificant trend towards
   more severe physical neglect. In addition to bring significantly higher
   on emergency room visits, DSPs were marginally higher than DSs on
   nonpsychiatric outpatient visits. DSPs had significantly more frequent
   chronic and acute pain complaints at emergency room (ER) visits.
   Headaches were the most frequently coded diagnosis at ER visits in this
   sample. DSPs accounted for 89\% of these ER visits attributable to
   headaches. The interaction of psychological distress and reported
   severity of child maltreatment reveals subgroups with unique utilization
   patterns and medical complaints. Physicians should screen patients for
   child maltreatment severity and psychological distress and should be
   involved in mental health referral where necessary, (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As part of an investigation of a 1995 outbreak of leptospirosis in
   Nicaragua, a cross-sectional serologic survey was conducted in the town
   of El Sauce. Of 566 persons, 85 (15\%) were positive for IgM
   anti-Leptospira antibodies, indicating recent leptospirosis infection.
   Asymptomatic leptospirosis infection was common, with only 25 (29.4\%)
   of the 85 seropositive inhabitants reporting a febrile illness in the 2
   months before the survey. Multivariable analysis revealed that having an
   indoor water source remained independently protective against
   leptospirosis. Gathering wood was independently associated with
   infection. These findings suggest that asymptomatic infection with
   Leptospira is common in endemic areas of Leptospira transmission.
   Improvement in water sanitation and behavioral modifications to reduce
   environmental exposure may reduce the risk of leptospirosis in endemic
   regions.}},

   of analytical techniques and a programme of mechanical testing, It is
   shown that the microstructure and properties of the diffusion bond are
   strongly influenced by the prebonding processing route used in its
   manufacture. Using conventional encapsulation techniques the interface
   is contaminated by oxide particles, whose composition and morphology
   depends upon the precise chemistry of the steel. These particles prevent
   grain growth across the interface and frequently result in tensile
   fracture at the interface, Refinements to the prebonding processing
   route result in lower particle densities and grain growth across the
   interface. However, these measures result in the interface becoming
   weakened by the precipitation of copper at the interface. MST/4607.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   Design To compare elevation and movement of the bladder neck after
   tension-free vaginal tape and open Burch colposuspension, using
   transperineal ultrasound. Prospective, non-randomised study using pre-
   and post-operative transperineal ultrasound of the bladder neck.
   Setting Tertiary referral urogynaecology unit at a London teaching
   hospital.
   Sample Thirty consecutive women who underwent tension-free vaginal tape
   or colposuspension for primary genuine stress incontinence between March
   1998 and June 1999.
   Methods Women underwent transperineal ultrasound of the bladder neck
   prior to and three to four weeks after surgery.
   Main outcome measures Bladder neck elevation, angle and movement in
   relation to the pubic symphysis,
   Results For both tension-free vaginal tape and colposuspension the
   post-operative bladder neck angles at rest and valsalva were more acute
   than pre-operatively. The post-operative linear movement on valsalva was
   less than pre-operatively. For colposuspension the rotational movement
   on valsalva was significantly less post-operatively, but for
   tension-free vaginal tape there was only a trend towards less
   post-operative rotational movement. Post-operative angles and movement
   were significantly less for colposuspension. The resting bladder neck
   position was elevated significantly tnore by colposuspension.
   Conclusion Both tension-free vaginal tape and colposuspension decrease
   bladder neck angles at rest and valsalva, linear movement on valsalva
   and elevate the bladder neck. The colposuspension causes significantly
   more change than the tension-free vaginal tape. This suggests the
   mechanism of continence for the tension-free vaginal tape is less
   dependent on bladder neck change than the colposuspension.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{296-308}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The mammalian zona pellucida is an extracellular matrix surrounding the
   oocyte, and is com posed of three major glycoproteins, ZP1, ZP2, and
   ZP3. Previous studies have suggested that the sperm receptor activity of
   the zona pellucida resides in specific oligosaccharide chains on the ZP3
   glycoprotein. However, the nature of the terminal monosaccharide(s) on
   these glycosidic chains to which sperm bind is a matter of active
   debate. Evidence has been presented to support a role for at least three
   distinct monosaccharides in sperm binding, alpha-galactose, L-fucose on
   Lewis X structures, and beta-N-acetylglucosamine. Previous studies have
   shown that beta-N-acetylglucosamine is uniformly distributed throughout
   the zona matrix. In this study, we have investigated the expression and
   distribution of alpha-galactose and fucose moieties during the
   maturation of the zona pellucida in mouse, rat, and hamster.
   Interestingly, alpha-galactose residues are expressed only during later
   stages of zona secretion and, consequently, are confined to the inner
   portions of the mature zona pellucida in mouse and rat. In hamster,
   alpha-galactose residues are only detectable in the zona pellucida of
   ovulated eggs, and are not found in ovarian oocytes. Fucosyl residues
   linked to Lewis X glycosides are not detectable at any stage of zona
   maturation in these three species, whereas fucose linked to N-linked
   core oligosaccharides are present throughout the zona. These studies
   indicate a previously unappreciated heterogeneity in the composition of
   zona glycosides. The specific localization of alpha-galactose residues
   to the inner portions of the zona matrix suggest a role in the later
   stages of sperm penetration through the zona. Finally, due to their
   absence from the zona surface, alpha-galactose and Lewis X fucosyl
   residues are not likely to be mediators of primary sperm binding. Mel.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors present a livelock- and deadlock-free
   fault-tolerant wormhole routing strategy known as NAFTA that
   successfully routes messages in the presence of up to N- 1 faults in an
   N x N two-dimensional mesh, while requiring only four virtual channels
   per physical link. NAFTA does not require any global network information
   but uses nine status definitions that describe the status of only the
   neighboring nodes. NAFTA can dynamically route messages around faulty
   nodes without incurring significant performance degradation. Through
   extensive simulation studies, it is shown that for a 256 x 256 mesh, the
   first fault has the most significant impact on the throughput and
   message passing latency of the mesh. However, successive faults cause
   only a slight reduction in message passing performance.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{842-846}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the reliability of the orthodromic facial nerve
   action potential (FNAP), recorded from the intratemporal portion of the
   facial nerve on stimulation within the cerebellopontine angle.
   Study Design: Prospective study.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: Ten consecutive patients undergoing translabyrinthine
   resection of vestibular schwannoma.
   Intervention: Diagnostic.
   Main Outcome Measures: Ten consecutive FNAPs were recorded on
   stimulation of the facial nerve within the cerebellopontine angle. The
   FNAP recording probe was placed directly on the nerve surface after the
   fallopian canal was opened at the second genu. Ten consecutive compound
   muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were recorded simultaneously from
   surface electrodes overlying the facial musculature, by use of a
   standardized electrode placement technique. The stimulating and
   recording equipment were removed (excluding CMAP surface electrodes) and
   reapplied, and FNAP and CMAP data were recorded for a second time
   (test/retest). Peak-to-peak amplitudes of all waveforms were calculated.
   Results: The average FNAP peak-to-peak amplitude for all patients was
   larger than the CMAP peak-to-peak amplitude (2.60 mV and 1.07 mV,
   respectively). Random effects analysis of variance was performed to
   assess the individual components of variation. This showed that CMAP was
   less variable than FNAP for replicate error (10 consecutive FNAPs and
   CMAPs) and test/retest error. However, subject variance was less for
   FNAP, where subject variance was by far the largest contributor to
   overall variation. The reliability coefficient for FNAP was 0.995 and
   for the CMAP was 0.982, when absolute reliability is 1.0.
   Conclusion: These data confirm that the FNAP, recorded by the technique
   described here, is a reliable waveform when compared with the CMAP and
   is a valid method for assessing facial nerve function.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{604-612}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The use of functional brain imaging techniques has led to considerable
   advances in our understanding of brain processing of human visceral
   sensation. The use of complementary techniques such as functional MRI,
   positron emission tomography, magnetoencephalography, and EEG has led to
   the identification of a network of brain areas that process visceral
   sensation. These studies suggest that unlike somatic sensation, which
   has an intense homuncular representation in the primary somatosensory
   cortex (SI), visceral sensation is primarily represented in the
   secondary somatosensory cortex, whereas representation in SI is vague.
   This difference could account for the poor localization of visceral
   sensation in comparison with somatic sensation. However, in a manner
   similar to that of somatic sensation, visceral sensation is represented
   in the paralimbic and limbic structures such as the insular, anterior
   cingulate, and prefrontal cortices. These areas are likely to mediate
   the affective and cognitive components of visceral sensation. Recent
   studies suggest that negative emotional factors such as fear, and
   cognitive factors such as attention can modulate the brain processing of
   visceral sensation in the insular and anterior cingulate cortices. In
   addition, alterations in the pattern of cortical processing of visceral
   sensation have been described in patients with functional
   gastrointestinal pain. It is likely that future research into the
   factors that modulate the brain processing of visceral sensation in
   health and disease are likely to improve further our understanding of
   the pathophysiology of functional visceral pain disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To assess the influence of preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE)
   on the long-term outcome of liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC) in injured liver.
   Summary Background Data
   On an healthy liver, PVE of the liver to be resected induces hypertrophy
   of the remnant liver and increases the safety of hepatectomy. On injured
   liver, this effect is still debated.
   Methods
   During the study period, 10 patients underwent preoperative PVE and 19
   patients did not before resection of three or more liver segments for
   HCC in injured liver (cirrhosis or fibrosis). PVE was performed when the
   estimated rate of remnant functional liver parenchyma (ERRFLP) assessed
   by computed tomographic scan volumetry was less than 40\%.
   Results
   In all patients, PVE was feasible. There were no deaths or
   complications. The ERRFLP after PVE was significantly increased compared
   with the pre-PVE value. Liver resection was performed after PVE in 9 of
   10 patients, with surgical death and complication rates of 0\% and 45\%,
   respectively. PVE increased the number of resections of three or more
   segments by 47\% (9/19). Overall actuarial survival rates with or
   without previous PVE (89\%, 87\%, and 44\% vs. 80\%, 53\%, and 53\% at
   1, 3 and 5 years, respectively) and disease-free actuarial survival
   rates (86\%, 64\%, and 21\% vs. 55\%, 17\%, and 17\% at 1, 3, and 5
   years respectively) after hepatectomy were comparable.
   Conclusion
   With the use of PVE, more patients with previously unresectable HCC in
   injured liver can benefit from resection. Longterm survival rates are
   comparable to those after resection without PVE.}},

   plasticity: An in vitro whole brain study}},

Abstract = {{The isolated whole brain (IWB) preparation of the guinea pig was used to
   investigate the floccular modulation of vestibular-evoked responses in
   abducens and oculomotor nerves and abducens nucleus; for identification
   of flocculus target neurons (FTNs) in the vestibular nuclei and
   intracellular study of some of their physiological properties; to search
   for possible flocculus-dependent plasticity at the FTN level by pairing
   of vestibular nerve and floccular stimulations; and to study the
   possibility of induction of longterm depression (LTD) in Purkinje cells
   by paired stimulation of the inferior olive and vestibular nerve.
   Stimulation of the flocculus had only effects on responses evoked from
   the ipsilateral (with respect to the stimulated flocculus) vestibular
   nerve. Floccular stimulation significantly inhibited the
   vestibular-evoked discharges in oculomotor nerves on both sides and the
   inhibitory field potential in the ipsilateral abducens nucleus while the
   excitatory responses in the contralateral abducens nerve and nucleus
   were free from such inhibition. Eleven second-order vestibular neurons
   were found to receive a short-latency monosynaptic inhibitory input from
   the flocculus and were thus characterized as FTNs. Monosynaptic
   inhibitory postsynaptic potentials from the flocculus were bicuculline
   sensitive, suggesting a GABA(A)-ergic transmission from Purkinje cells
   to FTNs. Two of recorded FTNs could be identified as vestibulospinal
   neurons by their antidromic activation from the cervical segments of the
   spinal cord. Several pairing paradigms were investigated in which
   stimulation of the flocculus could precede, coincide with, or follow the
   vestibular nerve stimulation. None of them led to long-term modification
   of responses in the abducens nucleus or oculomotor nerve evoked by
   activation of vestibular afferents. On the other hand, pairing of the
   inferior olive and vestibular nerve stimulation resulted in
   approximately a 30\% reduction of excitatory postsynaptic potentials
   evoked in Purkinje cells by the vestibular nerve stimulation. This
   reduction was pairing-specific and lasted throughout the entire
   recording time of the neurons. Thus in the IWB preparation, we were able
   to induce a LTD in Purkinje cells, but we failed to detect traces of
   flocculus-dependent plasticity at the level of FTNs in vestibular
   nuclei. Although these data cannot rule out the possibility of synaptic
   modifications in FTNs and/or at other brain stem sites under different
   experimental conditions, they are in favor of the hypothesis that the
   LTD in the flocculus could be the essential mechanism of cellular
   plasticity in the vestibuloocular pathways.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an all point transmit and receive focusing method based on
   transmit synthetic focusing combined with receive dynamic focusing in a
   linear array transducer, In the method, on transmit, a virtual source
   element is assumed to be located at the transmit focal depth of
   conventional B-mode imaging systems, and transmit synthetic focusing is
   used in two half planes, one before and the other after the transmit
   focal depth, using the rf data of each scanline, together with all other
   relevant rf scanline data previously stored. The proposed new method
   uses the same data acquisition scheme as the conventional focusing
   method while maintaining the same frame rate via high-speed signal
   processing, but it is not suitable for imaging moving objects. It
   improves upon the lateral resolution and sidelobe level at all imaging
   depths. Also, it increases the transmit power and image signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR), due to transmit field synthesis, and extends the image
   penetration depth as well. Evaluations with simulation and experimental
   data show much improvement in resolution and SNR at all imaging depths.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to evaluate the relative toxicity of (+) and
   (-)-gossypol enantiomers in 0-3-week-old broilers. Treatments consisted
   of broiler starter diets formulated with either a glandless, which did
   not contain gossypol, a commercial glanded {[}62.2\% (+)-gossypol], or a
   glanded moco {[}83.2\% (+)-gossypol] crushed cottonseed (CCS) (six
   replicates/treatment) plus a soybean meal negative control. Glandless
   cottonseed was mixed with the moco cottonseed (2.4\% free gossypol) so
   that both the commercial glanded and moco glanded cottonseeds contained
   equivalent concentrations of free gossypol (2.0\%). The cottonseed
   treatments were added at 5 and 10\% of the diet. Body weights and feed
   conversions were determined weekly. Body weights and feed-to-gain ratios
   of broilers fed 5 and 10\% glandless CCS and 5\% moco CCS were not
   significantly different. Broilers receiving 10\% commercial glanded CCS
   weighed significantly less than those subjected to all other treatments.
   Feed-to-gain ratios were significantly higher for broilers receiving
   10\% commercial glanded and 10\% moco CCS as compared to 5\% moco and
   glandless CCS, 10\% glandless CCS, and control. Relative liver weights
   of birds receiving 10\% moco CCS were significantly less than those of
   birds receiving 10\% commercial CCS. The data clearly showed that
   broilers fed moco CCS containing a relatively high (+)- to (-)-gossypol
   enantiomer ratio performed better than broilers receiving commercial CCS
   with a lower (+)- to (-)-gossypol enantiomer ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim was to compare the follicular response to 37.5 and 50
   IU of recombinant follicle-simulating hormone (FSH) as starting doses
   for ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome
   (PCOS).
   Methods: Prospective, randomized crossover study including 15 women with
   clomiphene citrate-resistant chronic anovulatory infertility. Patients
   were treated with subcutaneous recombinant FSH at starting doses of 37.5
   IU and 50 IU, respectively according to a low-dose step-up protocol.
   Each woman received both treatments, in a randomized or der, with an
   interval of greater than or equal to1 month between treatments.
   Results: All treatment cycles were ovulatory after an appropriate
   follicular response and hormone levels were similar with both
   treatments, althorlgh the total quantity of FSH required and the mean
   daily dose required to induce identical follicular development were
   significantly lower with a starting dose of 37.5 IU FSH. The mean
   duration of treatment to achieve ovulation was approximately 13 days
   with both treatments but treatment periods greater than or equal to 20
   days were required in some patients.
   Conclusions: In women with PCOS, a starting dose of 37.5 IU recombinant
   FSH may be adequate to induce follicular growth. However; the rise of
   low stal ring doses mcay result in some cases in increased treatment
   periods and need for monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic optimization (open-loop optimal control) of bioprocesses is

   gradients and Hessians for the objective function of the underlying
   dynamic process model. A further extension of this scheme,which makes
   use of restricted second-order information, is also presented. This
   extension results in an efficient way to solve general dynamic
   optimization problems, even for high levels of control discretization.
   This new approach allows the efficient and robust solution of two

Abstract = {{In order to identify biochemical markers of kidney damage prior to
   transplantation. we determined the levels of activity of a range of
   proteolytic enzymes in kidney perfusate samples from non-heart-beating
   donor (NHBD) cases. Urinary protease activities have been described as
   indices of kidney damage in renal disease; their potential as markers of
   tissue damage in kidneys before transplantation has not been assessed.
   In an attempt to identify additional/improved biochemical markers, the
   present study compared the levels of total glutathione S-transferase
   (GST) with corresponding levels of several proteolytic enzymes in
   perfusate fluid from machine perfused NHBD kidneys. Proteases were
   selected to represent factors that may influence enzyme efflux, such as
   intracellular localization or molecular size.
   Methods: Perfusate samples were obtained over an 8-hour period from
   machine-preserved NHBD kidneys. Protease activities in these samples
   were determined by fluorometric assays and comparison made with total
   GST activity. Individual proteases were analysed in the transplanted and
   non-transplanted kidney groups (discarded on the basis of other
   viability parameters).
   Results: A correlation between protease activity and total GST was
   obtained for only leucyl- and pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase. Furthermore,
   in the transplanted group, it was possible to set nominal upper limits
   of activity for alanyl-arginyl- and dipeptidyl IV-aminopeptidase (AP).
   In the non-transplanted kidney group protease levels were increased
   above ``normal{''} upper limits for the same enzyme types. By the use of
   alanyl AP it was possible to discriminate 75\% of unsuitable kidneys
   discarded by the use of other criteria.
   Conclusion: The lack of correlation between total GST and protease
   activity for most of the enzymes investigated and alanyl AP levels in
   perfusate samples could be related to differences in cellular
   localisation, suggesting that assays of alanyl AP may give complimentary
   biochemical information relating to kidney tissue damage. Quantification
   of alanyl AP in machine perfusate samples may be a valuable additional
   independent biomarker of tissue damage.}},

Abstract = {{Mammalian INT6 protein has been considered to be a subunit of the
   eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF3. The Int6 locus is also
   known as a common integration site of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV).
   However, the function of Int6 in translation initiation and the
   mechanism of Int6-mediated tumor induction are yet to be explored. In
   this study, the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, int6(+), which
   is 43\% identical to the mammalian counterpart, was deleted. Despite the
   evidence that the majority of Int6 protein was associated with 40S
   particles in this organism, strains lacking int6(+) (Delta int6) were
   viable and showed only moderate inhibition in the rate of in vivo global
   protein synthesis. Polysome profile analysis showed no apparent defects
   in translation initiation. Delta int6 exhibited a hypersensitivity to
   caffeine, which could be suppressed by the addition of sorbitol to the
   growth medium. This and other phenotypes would imply that int6(+) is
   required for the integrity of cell membrane. In meiosis, Delta int6
   produced incomplete tetrads frequently. High dosage expression of a
   truncated mutant of int6(+) conferred a hypersensitivity to caffeine,
   but did not cause the defect in meiosis. A possible link between the
   function of int6(+) and the Delta int6-phenotypes is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The maximum strain in a glass reinforced plastic (GRP) vessel, used for
   unpressurised liquid storage and supported on rigid saddle supports,
   occurs in the immediate region of the saddle horn on the outside
   surface. An existing Fourier series solution of this problem has been
   used to conduct a parametric study and extend the previous work given by
   Tooth et al. (Proc Inst Mech Engr, Part E: Process Mech Engng 208 (1994)
   59). To provide the results for the maximum strain in a `closed form',
   an equation fitting technique has been used. This work, presented
   originally at the ICPVT-9, Sydney, gives a simplified design approach
   for the symmetric laminate. Following the preparation of the work for
   the ICPVT-9, a more comprehensive treatment, covering a wider range of
   vessel support locations, was carried out, and presented by Nash et al.
   (Proc Inst Mech Engr, Part L, J Mater: Design Applications, in press).
   Recognising the value of the simplified approach presented in the
   ICPVT-9 paper, use was made of the work of Tooth et al. and Nash et al.
   to extend its range of applicability to provide confidence in using this
   simplified approach for other saddle locations. The resulting paper
   presented here, should provide useful background and illustrates the use
   of the method with the aid of an example. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Outcrops of Upper Miocene to Upper Pliocene deposits in the Atlantic
   side of the Rifian Corridor, northwest Morocco, provide data that allow
   an assessment of the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the main seaway
   that connected the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean, until its final
   closure at the end of the Miocene. A reconstruction of the sedimentary
   regimes and palaeobathymetries in the Gharb and Saiss Basins has been
   carried out from the physical and microfaunal (benthic foraminifera)
   characteristics of sediments and three sedimentary sequences are
   distinguished, fi om the oldest rocks deposited at the opening of the
   corridor (more than 8 Ma) to the Upper Pliocene sediments (younger than
   4 Ma) that ended the marine sedimentation. The maximum palaeodepth
   recognised (about 500 m) occurs in marry sediments of the coastal area
   (Bou Regreg composite section) between 8 and 5.9 Ma. This is followed by
   a tectonically controlled, shallowing phase leading to the establishment
   of neritic conditions and corresponding to a relative sea-level lowering
   of about 300 m, that we suggest relates to closure of the passageway and
   consequent onset of the Meditcrranenn evaporite deposition. The
   persistence in the Saiss Basin of middle neritic palaeodepths since the
   upper. Tortonian (about 7.8 Ma) suggests, for this internal basin, a
   sill physiography. Evidence from the present and previously documented
   palaeobathymetric reconstructions indicates that the tectonic activity
   in the Atlantic corridor started from the eastern side and moved to the
   west. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new type of radio frequency (rf) large area non equilibrium ('cold')
   plasma source operating at atmospheric gas pressures in an open reactor
   was presented. The source was based on a specially designed rf electrode
   with the gas flowing through an inner microstructure integrated in the
   electrode. A cylindrical source of 35 mm in diameter with approximately
   900 hollow cathodes forming an integrated open structure and a
   rectangular 120 X 20 mm(2) source of this type were tested. A typical rf
   power for the source operation is only several tens of watts.
   Experiments show that the performance of both sources at atmospheric
   pressure was substantially better in comparison with single cylindrical
   rf hollow cathodes of 400 mum in diameter. The argon and neon plasmas
   generated in the space between the main electrode and the substrate
   holder were uniform and very stable. The optical emission spectroscopy
   study, the rf current, voltage and impedance measurements, as well as
   the substrate temperature tests reveal three different power dependent
   regimes of these plasma sources. Effects of plasma treatment of surfaces
   were studied on both temperature sensitive samples (plastic webs) and
   metals (aluminum, steel). An effective cleaning of Al samples was
   observed after 5 min treatment in the neon plasma in an open reactor.
   After 1 s treatment of the Polyethylene web the surface tension
   increases from values < 34 mN/m to values <greater than or equal to> 56
   mN/m. Design of sources allows their direct scaling up and may bring a
   number of interesting applications in large area cold atmospheric plasma

Abstract = {{We have studied the transduction of TAT-HA-beta -galactosidase fusion
   protein into two cell lines of rat salivary gland origin, A5 and C6-21,
   into cells of fetal mouse submandibular glands in organ culture, and
   into rat submandibular gland after retrograde duct injection, using a
   histochemical method to demonstrate beta -galactosidase activity.
   Transduction of the fusion protein into A5 and C6-21 cells was
   concentration- and time-dependent. Therefore, the intensity of the beta
   -galactosidase staining, which was cytoplasmic. was less after 1 hr of
   exposure compared to exposures up to 24 hr. However, the fusion protein
   was transduced into 100\% of both types of cultured cells. When explants
   of mouse fetuses at 13 days of gestation were exposed to the fusion
   proteins, both epithelial and mesenchymal cells were stained for the
   enzyme, with a conspicuous accumulation of the reaction product at
   perinuclear cytoplasmic regions. The histochemical staining of the
   mesenchymal cells was more intense compared to that seen in epithelial
   cells. TAT-HA-beta -galactosidase fusion protein was also delivered to
   rat submandibular glands by retrograde duct injection. Histochemical
   staining for beta -galactosidase activity of cryostat sections prepared
   from the injected glands revealed that the transduction of the fusion
   protein was also time- and dose-dependent. In the glands of rats
   sacrificed from 10 min to 1 hr after the retrograde injection,
   essentially all acinar and duct cells showed cytoplasmic staining. The
   intensity of the staining then declined, and was not seen in the glands
   of rats killed 24 hr after the injection of the fusion proteins. These
   results indicate that a full-length, active TAT fusion protein can be
   targeted to salivary gland cells both in vitro and in vivo to analyze
   physiological, developmental, and pathophysiological processes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this laboratory study was to determine the
   bond strength of a base metal alloy to a high-noble alloy and amalgam
   when a new chemical adhesion promoter was used in conjunction with a
   resin cement. Method and materials: Specimens of high-noble alloy and
   amalgam were prepared in epoxy-filled rings. Base metal cylinders were
   cast. The ends of the cylinders and the metal bonding substrates were
   wet ground and air abraded with aluminum oxide. The base metal cylinders
   were cemented with Panavia 21 resin cement after application of 1 of the
   following to the high-noble and amalgam metal surfaces: (1) Alloy
   Primer, (2) ED Primer, (3) Alloy Primer and ED Primer, or (4) tin
   plating. Bond values were determined after 24 hours' storage and after 3
   months' storage and thermocycling. Results: At both 24 hours and 3
   months, tin plating yielded the highest bond strengths to a high-noble
   alloy, but the value for the Alloy Primer groups was not significantly
   lower. There was no statistically significant difference between the
   24-hour and 3-month values within the 4 treatment regimens. Conclusion:
   Treatment of amalgam or high-noble alloy with either tin plating or
   Alloy Primer before bonding with Panavia 21 resin cement yielded
   equivalent bond strengths to a base metal alloy. ED Primer was not an
   effective metal primer. There was no advantage to combining Alloy Primer
   and ED Primer.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To use technetium Tc 99m diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid
   (Tc-99m-DTPA) renal scintigraphy to monitor ureteral obstruction after
   ureteroneocystostomy in a canine model of partial ureteral obstruction.
   Study Design-Experimental study.
   Animals-Eight normal adult dogs.
   Methods-Partial ureteral obstruction was created in 8 dogs by incomplete
   ligation of the terminal right ureter. Two weeks later,
   ureteroneocystostomy was performed in 7 dogs with unilateral partial
   ureteral obstruction and in 1 dog that had developed bilateral partial
   ureteral obstruction. Tc-99m-DTPA scintigraphy was performed
   intermittently for 2 weeks after ureteroneocystostomy. Renal transit
   time of each kidney, as assessed by the time to maximal uptake (time of
   peak), and glomerular filtration rate, as assessed by percentage of
   kidney uptake of the radiopharmaceutical between 1 and 3 minutes, were
   estimated. Comparison between affected and nonaffected kidneys was
   performed with the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
   Results-Unilateral partial ureteral obstruction was induced successfully
   in 7 dogs. In 1 dog, bilateral partial obstruction was induced
   inadvertently. After ureteroneocystostomy, percentage of kidney uptake
   of Tc-99m-DTPA was low in 4 affected kidneys. The uptake returned to
   within normal limits in 2 of the kidneys during the observation period.
   The time activity curve had a more rounded appearance or was increasing
   continuously for all affected kidneys. A significant increase in renal
   transit time was observed 2 and 4 days after ureteroneocystostomy.
   Transit time progressively returned to normal by 4 to 11 days for all
   affected kidneys except 1.
   Conclusion-Ureteroneocystostomy resulted in persistent partial ureteral
   obstruction for 4 to 1 1 days as determined by Tc-99m-DTPA scintigraphy.
   Clinical Relevance-Tc-99m-DTPA scintigraphy may be a useful procedure
   for monitoring renal function and ureteral obstruction after
   ureteroneocystostomy. Persistent partial ureteral obstruction may be
   seen 1 to 2 weeks after ureteral reimplantation in dogs with previously
   existing dilated ureters. (C) Copyright 2000 by The American College of

Abstract = {{Isolated newborn, but not adult, rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN) cells
   exhibit spontaneous activity that (unlike adult) are highly sensitive to
   the Na+ current (I-Na) blocker TTX. To investigate this TTX action on
   automaticity, cells were voltage clamped with ramp depolarizations
   mimicking the pacemaker phase of spontaneous cells (-60 to -20 mV, 35
   mV/s). Ramps elicited a TTX-sensitive current in newborn (peak density
   0.89 +/- 0.14 pA/pF, n = 24) but not adult (n = 5) cells. When
   depolarizing ramps were preceded by steplike depolarizations to mimic
   action potentials, ramp current decreased 54.6 +/- 8.0\% (n = 3) but was
   not abolished. Additional experiments demonstrated that ramp current
   amplitude depended on the slope of the ramp and that TTX did not alter
   steady-state holding current at pacemaker potentials. This excluded a
   steady-state Na+ window component and suggested a kinetic basis, which
   was investigated by measuring TTX-sensitive I-Na during long step
   depolarizations. I-Na exhibited a slow but complete inactivation time
   course at pacemaker voltages (tau = 33.9 +/- 3.9 ms at -50 mV),
   consistent with the rate-dependent ramp data. The data indicate that
   owing to slow inactivation of I-Na at diastolic potentials, a small
   TTX-sensitive current flows during the diastolic depolarization in
   neonatal pacemaker myocytes.}},

Abstract = {{In an endemic area where malaria transmission is intense and continuous,
   reappearance of asexual parasites may be ascribed to either
   recrudescence or reinfection. To distinguish between recrudescence and
   reinfection after oral treatment with chloroquine, amodiaquine,
   pyronaridine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, halofantrine, or artesunate,
   three polymorphic markers (circumsporozoite protein, merozoite surface
   antigens 1 and 2) from pre-treatment and post-treatment samples were
   amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and the in vitro response to
   chloroquine was determined for comparison. Of 52 paired samples, 22
   (42\%) were reinfections. Recrudescence occurred more frequently on or
   before Day 14 (22 of 30 cases, 73\%). Except for one case, all
   reinfections were observed beyond Day 14. The phenotype determination
   was not sufficiently precise to distinguish between recrudescence and
   reinfection. Our results suggest that beyond Day 14 land until Day 42),
   recrudescence and reinfection cannot be distinguished at our study site
   unless molecular techniques are used and that some results derived from
   the polymerase chain reaction need to be compared with the microscopic
   examination of thick blood smear to exclude gametocyte carriers without
   asexual parasites after treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Spo11, a protein first identified in yeast, is thought to generate the
   chromosome breaks that initiate meiotic recombination. We now report
   that disruption of mouse Spoil leads to severe gonadal abnormalities
   from defective meiosis. Spermatocytes suffer apoptotic death during
   early prophase; oocytes reach the diplotene/dictyate stage in nearly
   normal numbers, but most die soon after birth. Consistent with a
   conserved function in initiating meiotic recombination, Dmc1/Rad51 focus
   formation is abolished. Spo11 (-/-) meiocytes also display homologous
   chromosome synapsis defects, similar to fungi but distinct from flies
   and nematodes. We propose that recombination initiation precedes and is
   required for normal synapsis in mammals. Our results also support the
   view that mammalian checkpoint responses to meiotic recombination and/or
   synapsis defects are sexually dimorphic.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Immunoglobulin T-cell receptor (IgTCR) molecules are potentially potent
   immune response modifiers because they allow T cells to bypass
   tolerance. Tolerance to self antigens has been one of the major barriers
   to the development of effective adoptive immunotherapies for treating
   cancer. In vitro studies in several laboratories have shown that
   cross-linking IgTCR molecules with the target antigen leads to cytolytic
   activity, cytokine release, and T-cell proliferation in model systems,
   However, many of these studies have used established T-cell lines rather
   than normal T cells or indirect assays of cytotoxicity, proliferation,
   and cytokine release. We have sought to establish the validity of these
   model systems while developing more effective adoptive immunotherapies
   using normal human T cells. In the present study the activation of
   T-cell proliferation after IgTCR cross-linking was evaluated. The
   results show that, in addition to IgTCR signals, CD28 costimulation is
   required to induce expansions of normal peripheral blood mononuclear
   cell-derived T cells. Signals from IgTCR alone can induce transient cell
   division, but they do not induce the prolonged polyclonal expansions
   that are characteristic of native immune responses. Very strong IgTCR
   signals could circumvent the CD28 requirement, but only at levels that
   are unlikely to be physiologically relevant. CD28 costimulation also
   suppressed the deletion of tumor-reactive subclones by
   activation-induced cell death. These studies confirm the importance of
   CD28 costimulation to thr proliferation of IgTCR-modified human T cells,
   a key feature of an effective, reconstructed antitumor response.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1298-1302}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background - Heredo-oto-ophthalmoencephalopathy (HOOE) is a dominantly
   inherited disease characterised by gradual loss of vision fi om the age
   of 20, progressive hearing loss from the late 20s, cerebellar ataxia in
   the 30s, and death in dementia in the fourth or fifth decade. Currently,
   no detailed description has been given of the ocular changes seen in
   HOOE. Therefore, the ocular changes of HOOE were described on the basis
   of clinical and histological data from six affected family members.
   Methods - Three members of the family affected by HOOE were subjected to
   a full ophthalmological re-examination, and postmortem examination was
   done on three eyes from two affected family members.
   Results - Visual loss in HOOE was caused by posterior subcapsular
   cataract and retinal neovascularisations leading to vitreous
   haemorrhages and neovascular glaucoma. In the retina there was extensive
   accumulation of an amyloid material, both diffusely and in the walls of
   the retinal vessels. The retinal glial cells showed extensive
   pathological changes and retinal Muller cells were seen to occlude the
   lumen of retinal vessels.
   Conclusion - Heredo-oto-ophthalmoencephalopathy is a familial
   amyloidosis of the central nervous system which is different from
   previously reported cases of amyloidosis by including cataract and
   retinal neovascularisations. The disease is accompanied by extensive
   changes in retinal glial cells that may play a part in the
   pathophysiology of the ocular complications of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of oral creatine supplementation (20 g d(-1)
   for 7 days) on metabolism during a 1-h cycling performance trial. Twenty
   endurance-trained cyclists participated in this double-blind placebo
   controlled study. Five days after familiarization with the exercise
   test, the subjects underwent a baseline muscle biopsy. Thereafter, a
   cannula was inserted into a forearm vein before performing the baseline
   maximal 1-h cycle (test 1 (T1)). Blood samples were drawn at regular
   intervals during exercise and recovery. After creatine (Cr) loading, the
   muscle biopsy, 1-h cycling test (test 2 (T2)) and blood sampling were
   repeated. Resting muscle total creatine (TCr), measured by high
   performance liquid chromatography, was increased (P < 0.001) in the
   creatine group from 123.0 +/- 3.8 - 159.8 +/- 7.9 mmol kg(-1) dry wt,
   but was unchanged in the placebo group (126.7 +/- 4.7 - 127.5 +/- 3.6
   mmol kg(-1) dry wt). The extent of Cr loading was unrelated to baseline
   Cr levels (r=0.33, not significant). Supplementation did not
   significantly improve exercise performance (Cr group: 39.1 +/- 0.9 vs.
   39.8 +/- 0.8 km and placebo group: 39.3 +/- 0.8 vs. 39.2 +/- 1.1 km) or
   change plasma lactate concentrations. Plasma concentrations of ammonia
   (NH3) (P < 0.05) and hypoxanthine (Hx) (P < 0.01) were lower in the Cr
   group from T1 to T2. Our results indicate that Cr supplementation alters
   the metabolic response during sustained high-intensity submaximal
   exercise. Plasma data suggest that nett intramuscular adenine nucleotide
   degradation may be decreased in the presence of enhanced intramuscular
   TCr concentration even during submaximal exercise.}},

Abstract = {{The external specification is currently approached by specification
   Languages for describing and analyzing system requirements. The external
   specification can be defined during the early stages of the system
   development and can be very useful for: checking the
   class/system/subsystem requirements; checking the system composition;
   evaluating costs of reuse; defining validated reference requirements,
   histories, and traces for the final validation. This paper presents a
   collection of criteria in order to formally verify the external
   specification of reactive systems/subsystems. The verification criteria
   are grounded on the Tempo Reale Object-oriented Language (TROL)
   specification model for real-time systems. In TROL, the external
   specification is expressed in terms of ports and clauses with temporal
   constraints. The goal of the verification criteria presented is to check
   the completeness and consistency of the external specification with
   special attention to temporal constraints. These criteria can be applied
   to other real-time specification models and have been enforced in the
   Tool Object Oriented Machine State (TOOMS) tool. A practical example
   illustrates the verification process that embodies these criteria.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of different carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on the short-term
   storage of semen samples from hatchery-produced steelhead (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) were evaluated. Sperm motility and fertilizing ability were
   significantly reduced following 4 h incubation under a relatively modest
   (greater than or equal to0.9 kPa = 1\%) amount of CO2. The
   dose-dependent reductions, however, were not the result of cell death as
   sperm viability was unaltered even at the highest (5.2 kPa = 5.6\%) CO2
   exposures. Reductions in sperm motility and fertilizing ability were
   reversible. Although previous work has indicated a direct relationship
   between salmonid sperm motility and sperm ATP content, the inhibitory
   effects of CO2 on sperm motility were not the result of reduced sperm
   ATP levels. Decreasing the pH of the seminal fluid (to below similar
   to7.5) significantly reduced sperm motility. However, this effect was
   only observed after prolonged (4 h) exposure; short-term (1 min)
   exposure to this lowered pH did not alter sperm motility. Moreover,
   acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, attenuated the inhibitory
   effects of CO2 on sperm motility. These results suggest that CO2
   inhibits steelhead sperm motility and therefore fertility in a
   dose-dependent manner, by reversibly lowering intracellular pH.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of standing crop on grasslands using a visual obstruction
   technique provides valuable information to help plan livestock grazing
   management and indicate the status of wildlife habitat. The objectives
   of this study were to: (1) develop a simple regression model using
   easily measured visual obstruction to estimate standing crop on sandy
   lowland range sites in the Nebraska Sandhills, (2) provide sampling and
   monitoring suggestions in the use of visual obstruction on this
   grassland type, and (3) compare the visual obstruction technique to the
   standard clip and weigh procedure. Visual obstruction precisely
   predicted average standing crop dry weights for the sandy lowland range
   sites (r(2) = 0.88). A prediction accuracy of +/- 295 kg ha(-1) was
   found using a test data set. Two sampling options (A and B) were
   evaluated using a 2-stage sampling protocol. Option A (1
   transect/quarter section) provided more precise estimates applicable to
   extensive grasslands than option B. However, option A was not applicable
   to a section (259 ha) or a Few sections. Option B (3 transects/section)
   provided estimates applicable to each section and to the entire area,
   but it required more intensive sampling than option A to attain the same
   precision. The visual obstruction technique provided more precise
   estimates of standing crop than the standard clip and weigh technique
   when clipping and weighing up to 6 plots per transect. When 7 or more
   clipped and weighed plots per transect were sampled, standing crop
   estimates were more precise than using visual obstruction readings.
   However, since 20 visual obstruction readings/transect (25 minutes) can
   be sampled in about half the time spent clipping and weighing 6
   plots/transect (45 minutes), visual obstruction in combination with a
   previously estimated regression model provides a simple, reliable, and
   cost effective alternative to the clip and weigh technique. Regression
   models should be developed for other grassland types following the
   methodology described in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Sox genes encode proteins related to each other, and to the sex
   determining gene Sry, by the presence of a DNA binding motif known as
   the HMG domain. Although HMG domains can bind to related DNA sequences,
   Sox gene products may achieve target gene specificity by binding to
   preferred target sequences or by interacting with specific partner
   proteins. To assess their functional similarities, we replaced the HMG
   box of Sry with the HMG box of Sox3 or Sox9 and tested whether these
   constructs caused sex reversal in XX mice. Our results indicate that
   such chimeric transgenes can functionally replace Sry and elicit
   development of testis cords, male patterns of gene expression, and
   elaboration of male secondary sexual characteristics. This implies that
   chimeric SRY proteins with SOX HMG domains can bind to and regulate SRY
   target genes and that potential SRY partner factor interactions are not
   disrupted by HMG domain substitutions. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Volume = {{45}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cells in the intra-articular disc of the temporomanadibular joint were
   studied ultrastructurally at three different ages to investigate any age
   changes. Rats aged 2, 15.5 months, and 2.5 years, and marmosets aged 21
   months, 7 years, and between 10.5 and 14 years were studied. In the
   first two age groups of the rat and the first of the marmoset, the cells
   were generally rounded and had moderate amounts of rough endoplasmic
   reticulum and other organelles associated with protein synthesis and
   secretion. Many cells had conspicuous amounts of microfilamentous
   material and cell membranes were closely applied to the collagen fibrils
   of the extracellular matrix. Occasionally, a narrow, irregular space
   containing microfilamentous material lay adjacent to the cell membrane.
   In the 2.5-year-old rats and the two older age groups of marmosets,
   cells with chondrocyte-like morphology were present. These cells were
   surrounded by a conspicuous pericellular matrix devoid of collagen
   fibrils and composed of microfilamentous material embedded in an
   amorphous ground substance. They resembled cells described in
   fibrocartilage from other sites, but differed from chondrocytes in
   hyaline cartilage by lacking a pericellular capsule. Thus, rats and
   marmosets both show cellular age changes in the intra-articular disc of
   the mandibular joint, which can be considered as changing from fibrous
   to fibrocartilaginous with age, a condition similar to that reported in
   humans. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{HpTX2 is a toxin from the venom of Heteropoda venatoria spider that has
   been demonstrated to bind on Kv4.2 potassium channel. We have determined
   the solution structure of recombinant HpTX2 by use of conventional
   two-dimensional NMR techniques followed by distance-geometry and
   molecular dynamics. The calculated structure belongs to the Inhibitory
   Cystin Knot structural family that consists in a compact
   disulfide-bonded core, from which four loops emerge. A poorly defined
   two-stranded antiparallel beta -sheet (residues 20-23 and 25-28) is
   detected. Analysis of the electrostatic charge anisotropy allows us to
   propose a functional map of HpTX2 different from the one described for
   kappa -conotoxin PVIIA, but strongly related to the one of
   charybdotoxin. The orientation of the dipole moment of HpTX2 emerges
   through K27 which could therefore be the critical lysine residue. Close
   to this lysine are a second basic residue, R23, an aromatic cluster (F7,
   W25, W30) and an hydrophobic side chain (L24). The high density in
   aromatic side chains of the putative functional surface as well as the
   lack of an asparagine is proposed to be the structural basis of the
   specificity of HpTX2 toward Kv4.2 channel.}},

   high clinical importance requiring rite implementation of effective
   quality control procedures in the diagnostic laboratory. An external
   quality control program including an inter-laboratory comparison could
   be of help in improving the quality of test results. Materials and
   Methods: Laboratories using BIOREF reference material sent their routine
   internal quality control results of each monthly control period to the
   evaluation center for statistical analysis and inter-laboratory
   comparison. Results: The inter-laboratory comparison showed that the
   mean values of test results obtained by different laboratories can vary
   considerably especially when different rest kits are used. A comparison
   of test results of laboratories using the same test kit showed much
   better correlation bur discepancies of coefficients of variation between
   these laboratories were still observed. Conclusion: An external quality
   control program revealed problems in the accuracy and precision of tumor
   marker test results in the individual laboratory, which could serve as a
   basis for the improvement of test performance.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that human serum paraoxonase (PON1) catalyzes the
   hydrolysis of organophosphate insecticides and nerve agents, as well as
   that of a number of aromatic carboxylic acid esters. Our laboratory has
   recently found a new class of PON1 substrates that includes at least 30
   lactones and cyclic carbonate esters. The lactone substrates vary in
   their ring size from 4 to 7 atoms. Substituents on the ring carbons may
   enhance or reduce the rate of lactone hydrolysis. An appreciable degree
   of stereospecificity exists with some activities differing up to 9-fold
   between enantiomers (i.e., S-alpha-hydroxy-gamma-butyrolactone is
   hydrolyzed 5 to 9 times faster than the R form). Thiolactones are
   hydrolyzed less efficiently, and some lactams are potent inhibitors.
   Four lactone-containing drugs-spironolactone, mevastatin, simvastatin,
   and lovastatin-have been identified as substrates for PON1. All lactone
   substrates are hydrolyzed by both the Q and R isozymes of human serum
   PON1. However, some lactone substrates are hydrolyzed faster by the Q
   than R isozyme, whereas others show a reverse preference. Moreover,
   these new substrates include homogentisic acid lactone, mevalonic acid
   lactone, homocysteine thiolactone, and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid
   lactone-all lactone forms of endogenous compounds. It is reasonable to
   expect that further investigations may uncover PON1 lactone substrates
   that are, themselves, endogenous compounds. In this article we
   characterize the basic enzymatic properties of PON1's newly identified
   hydrolytic activities with lactone and cyclic carbonate ester substrates
   and compare these properties with those of representative arylesters and
   organophosphates.}},

Abstract = {{Microvascular endothelial cells play a key role in inflammation by
   undergoing activation and recruiting circulating immune cells into
   tissues and foci of inflammation, an early and rate-limiting step in the
   inflammatory process. We have previously {[}Binion er al.,
   Gastroenterology 112:1898-1907, 1997] shown that human intestinal
   microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC) isolated from surgically
   resected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient tissue demonstrate
   significantly increased leukocyte binding in vitro compared to normal
   HIMEC. Our studies {[}Binion et al., Am. J. Physiol. 275 (Gastrointest.
   Liver Physiol. 38):G592-G603, 1998] have also demonstrated that nitric
   oxide (NO) production by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) normally
   plays a key role in downregulating HIMEC activation and leukocyte
   adhesion. Using primary cultures of HIMEC derived from normal and IBD
   patient tissues, we sought to determine whether alterations in
   iNOS-derived NO production underlies leukocyte hyperadhesion in IBD.
   Both nonselective (N-G-monomethyl-L-arginine) and specific
   (N-Iminoethyl-L-lysine) inhibitors of iNOS significantly increased
   leukocyte binding by normal HIMEC activated with cytokines and
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but had no effect on leukocyte adhesion by
   similarly activated IBD HIMEC. When compared to normal HIMEC, IBD
   endothelial cells had significantly decreased levels of iNOS mRNA,
   protein, and NO production following activation. Addition of exogenous
   NO by co-culture with normal HIMEC or by pharmacologic delivery with the
   long-acting NO donor detaNONOate restored a normal leukocyte binding
   pattern in the LED HIMEC. These data suggest that loss of iNOS
   expression is a feature of chronically inflamed microvascular
   endothelial cells, which leads to enhanced leukocyte binding,
   potentially contributing to chronic, destructive inflammation in LED.

   pelitic graphite schist, iron formation and metabasics (av. <4.2-4.7 ppm
   U, 18.5-60.2 ppm Th, 3.3-4.9 \%K). All rock types, except feldspar
   porphyry, exhibit noticeable difference in mean U and Ra (eU) values.
   Variation in U content has been conspicuous in carbonaceous rocks, with
   phyllitic units more enriched than graphitic schists. U and Th contents
   appear to be independent of K concentration in all rock types. Such
   features of variable radioelement concentration indicate differences in
   the composition of precursor sedimentary rocks and also differential

Abstract = {{The use of hot-water and evaporative cooling enables the residual energy
   potential of iron and steel works to be utilized. In particular,
   water-traversed wall elements are used at present in the top zone of an
   electric-are furnace. Indeed, the remarkable increase in the electrical
   power has made the cooling of the wall of the furnace compulsory. Thus,
   it seems suitable to use the energy recovered in the cooling elements,
   instead of transferring it to the atmosphere via closed cooling towers.
   Nucleate boiling leads to a substantially more intensive cooling, but
   even a limited increase in the input heat flow can be dangerous. If the
   slag accretions, temperature and thermal power are examined in cases of
   steady state furnace operation and completely slag-covered arcs, it is
   found that the thermal losses decrease remarkably as the melting
   temperature of the slag adhering to the furnace shell increases. The aim
   of this paper is, first of all, an analysis of heat transfer phenomena
   in UHP (ultra high power) electric-are furnaces. Then, energy and exergy
   analyses are dealt with after some remarks about exergy efficiency and
   chemical exergy of elements. In addition, means to reduce noise, air and
   water pollution are examined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A quantitative study of dry etch behavior in deep silicon trenches in
   high density plasmas (electron cyclotron resonance, inductively coupled
   plasma) at low temperatures (160-210 K) is presented. The quantitative
   approach implies etch behavior being studied in relation to the relevant
   particle fluxes (atomic F and O and ions) as measured by in situ
   diagnostics, Two etch modes are observed. In one mode faceting shows up
   as due to crystallographic orientation preference, i.e., Si{[}111] being
   etched slower than Si{[}100]. In the other mode the normal anisotropic
   ion-induced behavior is observed. Controlled switch from one mode to the
   other is studied under influence of process parameters like pressure,
   ion energy, and substrate temperature. The second part of this study
   deals with aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE). Both vertical and
   horizontal trenches have been taken into account as to distinguish
   between radical and ion-induced effects. The flux of radical species
   into the deep trench is governed by Knudsen transport, with a reaction
   probability of atomic fluorine of about 0.5. As a consequence depletion
   of the fluorine content at the bottom is the main reason for ARDE. With
   the bottleneck identified, the plasma process has been readily tuned to
   the aspect ratio independent etch regime. This regime coincides with the
   crystallographic preference mode where surface reaction kinetics form
   the rate limiting step. Detailed surface analysis studies by x-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ ellipsometry, and transmission
   electron microscopy have been used Co characterize the surface reaction
   process. (C) 2000 American Vacuum Society. {[}S0734-211X(00)00906-9].}},

Abstract = {{Lizards and birds are both popular ``model organisms{''} in behavioural
   ecology, but the interactions between them have attracted little study.
   Given the putative importance of birds as predators of diurnal Lizards,
   it is of considerable interest to know which traits (of lizards as well
   as birds) influence the outcome of a predatory attempt. We studied
   predation by giant terrestrial kingfishers (kookaburras, Dacelo
   novaeguineae: Alcedinidae) on heliothermic diurnal lizards (highland
   water skinks, Eulamprus tympanum: Scincidae), with particular reference
   to the role of prey (lizard) size. Our approach was twofold: to gather
   direct evidence (sizes of lizards consumed in the field, compared to
   those available) and indirect evidence rite-related shifts in lizard
   behaviour). We quantified the size structure of a natural population of
   skinks (determined by an extensive mark-recapture program), and compared
   it to the sizes of wild lizards taken by kookaburras (determined by
   analysis of prey remains left at the birds' nests,. Kookaburras showed
   size-based predation: they preyed mainly on small and medium-sized
   rather than large lizards in the field. However, the mechanism producing
   this bias remains elusive. It is not due to any distinctive behavioural
   attributes (locomotor ability, activity level, habitat usage) of the
   lizards of the size class disproportionately taken by the kookaburras.
   The greater vulnerability of subadult lizards may reflect subtle
   ontogenetic shifts in ecological and behavioural traits, but our data
   suggest that great caution is needed in inferring patterns of
   vulnerability to predation from indirect measures based on either the
   prey or the predator alone. Instead, we need direct observations on the
   interaction between the two.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative process for the analysis of mixture library components
   for their potential as selectors for chiral chromatography is described.
   The procedure involves the immobilization of each enantiomer of the
   target racemic analyte to silica gel, followed by incubation of each
   resulting stationary phase with a mixture library. The adsorbed library
   components on the two stationary phases are then analyzed by
   reversed-phase liquid chromatography. A comparison of the resulting two
   chromatograms is made. Any peak of identical retention time but with a
   significant difference in intensity in the two chromatograms indicates
   that this component is most likely a chiral selector. Its chemical
   structure is then determined by LC-MS or LC-MS-MS. This new screening
   method significantly increases the efficiency of chiral selector
   determination by eliminating the need for multilibrary syntheses, as
   opposed to our previous method. This technique should also allow for the
   screening of much larger libraries as compared to our previous work.}},

Title = {{Assessing the past thermal and chemical history of fluids in crystalline
   rock by combining fluid inclusion and isotopic investigations of
   fracture calcite}},
Journal = {{APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{1417-1437}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fluid inclusion studies combined with the isotope geochemistry of
   several generations of fracture calcite from the Olkiluoto research
   site, Finland, has been used to better understand the past thermal and
   fluid history in the crystalline rock environment. Typically, fracture
   mineral investigations use O and C isotopes from calcite and an estimate
   of the isotopic composition of the water that precipitated the calcite
   to perform delta(18)O geothermometry calculations to estimate past
   temperature conditions. By combining fluid inclusion information with
   calcite isotopes, one can directly measure the temperature at which the
   calcite formed and can better determine past fluid compositions.
   Isotopic, petrologic and fluid inclusion studies at the Olkiluoto
   research site in Finland were undertaken as part of an investigation
   within the Finnish nuclear waste disposal program. The study revealed
   that four fluids were recorded by fracture calcites. From petrologic
   evidence, the first fluid precipitated crystalline calcite at 151-225
   degrees C with a delta(13)C signature of -21 to -13.9 parts per thousand
   PDB and a delta(18)O signature of 12.3-13.0 parts per thousand SMOW.
   These closed fracture fillings were found at depths greater than 500 m
   and were formed from a high temperature, low salinity, Na-Cl fluid of
   possible meteoric water altered by exchange with wallrock or dilute
   basinal origin. The next fluid precipitated crystalline calcite with
   clay at 92-210 degrees C with a delta(13)C signature of -2.6 to +3.8
   parts per thousand PDB and a delta(18)O signature of 19.4-20.7 parts per
   thousand SMOW. These closed fracture fillings were found at depths less
   than 500 m and were formed from a moderate to high temperature, low to
   moderate salinity, Na-Cl fluid, likely of magmatic origin. The last
   group of calcites to form, record the presence of two distinct fluid
   types. The platy (a) calcite formed at 95-238 degrees C with a
   delta(13)C signature of -12.2 to -3.8 parts per thousand PDB and a
   delta(18)O signature of 14.9-19.6 parts per thousand SMOW, from a high
   temperature, low salinity, Na-Cl fluid of possible magmatic origin. The
   platy (b) calcite formed at 67-98 degrees C with a delta(13)C signature
   of -13.0 to -6.2 parts per thousand PDB and a delta(18)O signature of
   15.1-20.1 parts per thousand SMOW, from a low temperature, high
   salinity, Ca-Na-Cl fluid of possible basinal brine origin. The two
   calcites are related through a mixing between the two end members. The
   source of the fluids for the platy grey (a) calcites could be the
   olivine diabase dykes and sills that cut through the site. The source of
   fluids for the platy (b) calcites could be the Jotnian arkosic sandstone
   formations in the northern part of the site. At the Olkiluoto site,
   delta(18)O geothermometry does not agree with fluid inclusion data. The
   original source of the water that forms the calcite has the largest
   effect on the isotopic signature of the calcites formed. Large isotopic
   shifts are seen in any water by mineral precipitation during cooling
   under rock-water equilibrium fractionation conditions. Different calcite
   isotopic signatures are produced depending on whether cooling occurred
   in an open or closed system. Water-rock interaction, at varying W/R
   ratios, between a water and a host rock can explain the isotopic shifts
   in many of the calcites observed.
   In some cases it is possible to shift the delta(18)O of the water by
   +11.5 parts per thousand (SMOW) using a realistic water-rock ratio. This
   process still does not explain some of the very positive delta(18)O
   values calculated using fluid inclusion data. Several other processes,
   such as low temperature recrystallization, boiling, kinetic effects and
   dissolution of calcite front fluid inclusion walls can affect isotopic
   signatures to varying degrees. The discrepancy between fluid inclusion
   data and delta(18)O geothermometry at the Olkiluoto site was most likely
   due to poor constraint on the original source of the water. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Study aim: To evaluate the effect of intraoperative lymph node mapping
   and sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) on the axillary staging of
   patients with NO breast carcinoma. Two techniques were used: blue dye
   alone (Evans Blue and Patent Blue) and combined technique (blue dye and
   isotope).
   Methods: The incidence of axillary node metastasis in axillary lymph
   node dissection (ALND) and SLND was compared prospectively. Multiple
   sections of each SLN were examined by HPS staining and
   immunohistochemical techniques. Two sections of each non sentinel node
   in ALND specimens were examined by routine HPS staining.
   Results: 243 patients underwent ALND after SLN biopsy. The SLN detection
   rate was 225/243 cases (92.59\%): 89.94\% with blue dye alone and 100\%
   with the combined technique. The false-negative rate was less than 2\%.
   Conclusion: SN biopsy is an accurate staging technique for N0 breast
   cancer. SLN biopsy with multiple sections and immunohistochemical
   staining of the SLN can identify significantly more patients with lymph
   node metastases than ALND with routine HPS staining. (C) 2000 Editions

Abstract = {{The Helium Cooled Pebble Bed blanket concept developed in the frame of
   the EPB-programme is based on the use of low activation
   ferritic/martensitic steel (EUROFER-97) as structural material. As the
   maximum allowable temperature of this steel is 550 degreesC, the coolant
   helium temperature can not exceed 450-500 degreesC, resulting in a
   relatively low thermal efficiency of the power generation system. The
   use of a ceramic material like SiCf/SiC with a maximum allowable
   temperature of 1300 degreesC allows to increase the maximum helium
   temperatures in the blanket, with the possibility to adopt more
   efficient power conversion systems. SiCf/SiC provides some other
   attractive features from the neutronic point of view (low neutron
   absorber in comparison to EUROFER) and safety (low activation). To take
   full advantage of the potential of this structural material, a new
   blanket design has been proposed. The pebble beds have been arranged in
   parallel to the first wall - by this configuration it was possible to
   reduce the required amount of beryllium, to improve the tritium breeding
   ratio and increasing the allowable neutron fluence. Finally, the adopted
   flow scheme results in a decisive reduction of the coolant pressure
   drop. On the basis of this design thermo-mechanic, thermo-hydraulic and
   neutronic calculations have been performed to optimise the design
   parameters (number and thickness of the beds, Li-6 enrichment, helium
   temperatures and pressure, etc.). An assessment of the limitation of
   this concept in term of maximum neutron wall, surface heating,
   achievable tritium breeding ratio, thermal efficiency in the power
   conversion system, pumping power for the blanket cooling loops has been
   performed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many managers attempt to develop collaborative alliances with other
   organizations. Such strategies are difficult to implement: they are as
   likely to fail as to succeeed. Implementing and managing an alliance is
   harder than deciding to collaborate. This paper explores the topic

   partnering. It presents an interaction model of partnering which shows
   seven contextual factors that shape, and are shaped by, human action.
   This context. can both help and hinder the emergence of co-operative
   behaviour. The model is illustrated through a case study of two
   organizations (customer and supplier) attempting to co-operate more
   closely. The case shows how the cultural and other differences between
   the parties at first caused difficulty. Actions were taken to change
   aspects of the context to facilitate more cooperative behaviour.
   Improving interpersonal relations led to further actions to create more
   formal mechanisms which would support future co-operation. These appear
   to have contributed to the relationship exceeding the initial

Abstract = {{Techniques commonly used for wheat (Triticum aestivum L,) yield
   estimation employ weather data over the growing season. However, yield
   estimates are also required before,wheat is sown-particularly by the
   grain-exporting agencies to help them determine, in advance,
   wheat-export targets. In that case, time series techniques relying on
   past yield data can he used for yield forecasting. In this paper, a
   procedure for applying time series analysis to forecast yield is
   described. A few techniques (linear trend, quadratic trend, simple
   exponential smoothing, double exponential smoothing, simple moving
   averaging, and double moving averaging) were tested to model the average
   spring wheat yield series for Saskatchewan, Canada. Using 1975-1993,
   1975-1994, and 1975-1995 spring wheat yield data, yields were forecasted
   for 1994, 1995, and 1996, respectively. Based on a deterministic measure
   (i.e., mean squared error, RISE), it was found that the quadratic model
   produced the most accurate forecast during the model development periods
   (1975-1993, 1975-1993, and 1975-1995) and model testing periods (1994,
   1995, and 1996), Further, a discussion is provided on improving the
   forecast by forecasting the yield for the homogeneous subareas (within
   Saskatchewan) instead for the entire Saskatchewan as a unit. The
   subareas could be constructed on the basis of soil-climatic conditions
   or yield fluctuation, using a geographic information system.}},

Abstract = {{SYNOPSIS. The concept of modularity is fundamental to research in both
   evolutionary and developmental biology, though workers in each field use
   the idea in different ways. Although readily and intuitively recognized,
   modularity is difficult to define precisely. Most definitions of
   modularity are operational and implicit, particularly in developmental
   biology. Examination of several proposed definitions points to some
   general characteristics of developmental modules, for example their
   internal integration, and suggests the importance of devising a
   definition applicable at different levels of the biological hierarchy.
   Modules,like homologs, must be defined with respect to a specified level
   of the hierarchy, and a general definition should support both analyses
   of the evolving causal relationships between levels, and studies of the
   interconnections between modules of the same type. The designation of a
   developmental structure, process, or function as a ``module{''} is a
   testable hypothesis; this hypothesis is confirmed in the case of the
   dorsal marginal zone of the amphibian gastrula, which acts as a
   morphogenetic module. Discussions of developmental modularity can
   provide a meeting place for developmental and evolutionary biologists by
   helping us articulate key questions at the intersection;of the two
   fields, and design experiments to begin answering them.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the accuracy of photometric redshifts computed
   through a standard SED fitting procedure, where SEDs are obtained from
   broad-band photometry. We present our public code hyperz, which is
   presently available on the web. We introduce the method and we discuss
   the expected influence of the different observational conditions and
   theoretical assumptions. In particular, the set of templates used in the
   minimization procedure (age, metallicity, reddening, absorption in the
   Lyman forest,...) is studied in detail, through both real and simulated
   data. The expected accuracy of photometric redshifts, as well as the
   fraction of catastrophic identifications and wrong detections, is given
   as a function of the redshift range, the set of filters considered, and
   the photometric accuracy. Special attention is paid to the results
   expected from real data.}},

Abstract = {{The fungicide chlorothalonil is used extensively under several
   tradenames for the protection of various horticultural and fruit crops
   and bananas against fungal infections. It is also used as fungicide in
   wood preservation and as a preservative in paints. Clinical experience
   has shown chlorothalonil to be a contact allergen and several cases of
   allergic contact dermatitis attributed to chlorothalonil have been
   described. 2 previous guinea pig maximization test studies have shown
   the sensitizing potential of chlorothalonil to be high. The sensitizing
   property of chlorothalonil was studied by us with the predictive test
   methods the local lymph node assay and the cumulative contact
   enhancement test. In the local lymph node assay, chlorothalonil induced
   a dose-dependent increase in proliferation with a maximal stimulation
   index of 19.2 and 27.2. In the cumulative contact enhancement test, a
   statistically significant dose-dependent high sensitization rate was
   seen with a maximal sensitization rate of 100\%. In conclusion, it is
   evident that chlorothalonil is an extremely potent contact allergen,
   inducing sensitization using only topical exposure on intact skin. (C)

   after 1 wk (+191\%) and then was decreased after 3 wk. In the red

   < 0.05) and 3 wk (+15\%; P < 0.05). MCT4 protein was not altered in
   either the red or white muscles after 1 or 3 wk. MCT4 mRNA was
   transiently lowered (similar to 15\%) in both muscles in the 1st wk, but
   MCT4 mRNA levels were back to control levels after 3 wk. In conclusion,

Abstract = {{Lysosomal neuraminidase is the key enzyme for the intralysosomal
   catabolism of sialylated glycoconjugates and is deficient in two
   neurodegenerative lysosomal disorders, sialidosis and galactosialidosis.
   Here we report the identification of eight novel mutations in the
   neuraminidase gene of 11 sialidosis patients with various degrees of
   disease penetrance. Comparison of the primary structure of human
   neuraminidase with the primary and tertiary structures of bacterial
   sialidases indicated that most of the single amino acid substitutions
   occurred in functional motifs or conserved residues. On the basis of the
   subcellular distribution and residual catalytic activity of the mutant
   neuraminidases we assigned the mutant proteins to three groups: (i)
   catalytically inactive and not lysosomal; (ii) catalytically inactive,
   but localized in lysosome; and (iii) catalytically active and lysosomal.
   In general, there was a close correlation between the residual activity
   of the mutant enzymes and the clinical severity of disease. Patients
   with the severe infantile type II disease had mutations from group I,
   whereas patients with a mild form of type I disease had at least one
   mutation from group III. Mutations from the second group were mainly
   found in juvenile type II patients with intermediate clinical severity.
   Overall, our findings explain the clinical heterogeneity observed in
   sialidosis and may help in the assignment of existing or new allelic
   combinations to specific phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Steroid hormones play an important role in placental development.
   However, the exact cellular site of hormone action has not been
   evaluated in bovine placentomes. Thus, the present immunohistochemical
   study was designed to assess the distribution of progesterone receptors,
   oestrogen receptors and glucocorticoid receptors in bovine placentomes.
   Tissue specimens were obtained from cows at slaughter and from cattle
   during pre-term Caesarean section 27 h after prostaglandin
   administration, immediately after spontaneous parturition and from
   cattle that had retained the fetal membranes. Specific antibodies were
   used for receptor demonstration in tissue sections. Progesterone
   receptors were only detected in maternal connective tissue cells,
   whereas oestrogen receptors were also present in maternal crypt
   epithelium. At specific sites, both receptor immunoreactivities remained
   constant or changed significantly during pregnancy, were generally
   higher during Caesarean section and decreased post partum, but were less
   pronounced in cattle that released the fetal membranes than in those
   that retained the fetal membranes. Glucocorticoid receptors were evident
   in fetal connective tissue cells as well as in fetal and maternal blood
   vessels. Maternal crypt epithelial cells showed increasing
   immunoreactivities for glucocorticoid receptors during pregnancy.
   Receptor immunoreactivities tended to be lower after spontaneous
   parturition than during Caesarean section; these results were
   significant for progesterone and oestrogen receptors in animals that
   released the fetal membranes but not for those that retained the fetal
   membranes. The results indicate that in bovine placentome steroid
   hormone receptors are distributed in patterns that are specific to the
   type of cell, the stage of pregnancy and the tissue location, implying
   highly specific modulation of placental metabolism. Retention of the
   fetal membranes is reflected by altered placental receptor states at
   parturition.}},

Abstract = {{This article considers a simple model of reinforcement learning. All
   behavior change derives from the reinforcing or deterring effect of
   instantaneous payoff experiences. Payoff experiences are reinforcing or

   the actually experienced payoffs. This article shows that aspiration
   level adjustments may improve the decision maker's long-run performance
   by preventing him or her from feeling dissatisfied with even the best

   deviations from expected payoff maximization by creating ``probability

Abstract = {{Recent studies have reported new mechanisms that mediate the
   transcriptional synergy of strong tissue-specific enhancers, involving
   the cooperative assembly of higher-order nucleoprotein complexes called
   enhanceosomes. Here we show that the HPV18 enhancer, which controls the
   epithelial-specific transcription of the E6 and E7 transforming genes,
   exhibits characteristic features of these structures. We used deletion
   experiments to show that a core enhancer element cooperates, in a
   specific helical phasing, with distant essential factors binding to the
   ends of the enhancer. This core sequence, binding a Jun B/Fra-2
   heterodimer, cooperatively recruits the architectural protein HMG-I(Y)
   in a nucleoprotein complex, where they interact with each other.
   Therefore, in HeLa cells, HPV78 transcription seems to depend upon the
   assembly of an enhanceosome containing multiple cellular factors
   recruited by a core sequence interacting with AP1 and HMG-I(Y).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess whether hormonal agents used in the medical
   treatment of endometriosis, such as danazol and GnRH agonist, exert
   direct regulatory action on monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-I)
   expression by endometrial epithelial cells.
   Design: Primary cultures of epithelial cells isolated from human
   endometrium were exposed to different concentrations of cytokines and
   steroid hormone analogs. Expression of MCP-1 was analyzed at the levels
   of protein and messenger RNA. Setting: Gynecology clinic and laboratory
   of endocrinology of reproduction.
   Patient(s): Women presenting for infertility or pelvic pain in whom
   endometriosis was diagnosed by using laparoscopy.
   Intervention(s): Endometrial tissue biopsy performed at laparoscopy.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Secretion of MCP-1 protein was measured by
   using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA steady-state levels
   were measured by performing Northern blot analysis.
   Results: Buserelin acetate, a GnRH agonist (0.1-10 ng/mL), had no
   significant effect on MCP-1 expression, whereas danazol (10(-7)-10(-5)
   M), a testosterone analog, and dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory
   glucocorticoid hormone (10(-12)-10(-6) M), showed a direct and a
   dose-dependent inhibitory effect on MCP-1 expression. This effect
   occurred at the level of protein and mRNA.
   Conclusion(s): The findings of the study may affect understanding of the
   mechanisms by which hormonal treatments act on endometriosis and
   influence its clinical manifestations. (C) 894 by American Society for

   with ``dual{''} levels land an auxiliary level-1 (sl) over cap (2)

Abstract = {{In order to assess the influence of strenuous exercise on collagen
   characteristics of articular cartilage, the response of the collagen
   network was studied in seven 2-year-old Thoroughbreds subjected to
   strenuous exercise compared to 7 nontrained individuals. After 13 weeks,
   the animals were subjected to euthanasia, fetlock joints of the
   forelimbs were scored macroscopically after Indian Ink staining, and
   articular cartilage from different locations of the articular surface of
   the proximal first phalanx was sampled and analysed for water content,
   collagen content, hydroxylysine content and amount of
   hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) crosslinks. Gross lesions were
   significantly more severe in the exercised than in the nonexercised
   group. In the control animals, the characteristic site-specific
   differences in collagen parameters were found as described earlier, but
   in the strenuously exercised animals this physiological biochemical
   heterogeneity had disappeared. In the exercised animals, an increase in
   water content and a sharp decrease in HP crosslinking was found that was
   correlated with the presence of wear lines. It is concluded that the
   strenuous exercise provoked significant alterations in the
   characteristics of the collagen network of the articular cartilage of
   the fetlock joint which were suggestive of microdamage and loosening of
   the collagen network. The collagen component of cartilage, in contrast
   to the proteoglycan component, is known to have a very limited capacity
   for repair and remodelling due to an extremely low turnover rate.
   Therefore, alterations within the articular collagen network might be
   expected to play an important role in the pathophysiology of
   degenerative joint disorders.}},

   large population of ``free{''} numerically simulated aggregates (i.e.,
   where no restrictions to aggregate formation were imposed) the fractal
   properties obtained were estimated both using morphological concepts as
   well as light scattering theories, Furthermore, studies for aggregates
   having predefined morphological k(g) values (namely, k(g) >2 and ca. 1)
   were also performed in order to check the viability of these values. The
   results obtained for the three different populations of aggregates
   considered were used to infer, through a best-fit analysis, the fractal
   properties. Our best estimates are k(g) approximate to 1.27 and D-f
   approximate to 1.82, which are approximately independent of aggregate
   size and composition. These results are in very good agreement with
   numerical predictions reported by previous authors. However,
   experimental results systematically indicate k(g) > 2 This motivated the
   present authors to identify possible reasons for these large
   discrepancies. Present calculations indicate that partial sintering in
   conjunction with the polydispersity of aggregates (resulting in a
   cut-off function coefficient, k(p), > 1) contributes to a systematic
   increase in k(g), possibly justifying the differences between numerical
   and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{The serine protease inhibitor antithrombin-III (AT-III) is the principal
   in vivo inhibitor of blood coagulation, inactivating mainly thrombin,
   but also other serine proteases. Binding of AT-III to heparin
   dramatically increases its inhibitory effect. AT-III deficiency during
   cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can lead to insufficient anticoagulation
   which cannot be treated by higher doses of heparin.
   A 60-year-old male with familial AT-III deficiency was admitted to our
   hospital for coronary artery bypass surgery and aortic valve
   replacement. Four days before the operation, acenocoumarol was stopped
   and anti-X-a nadroparincalcium (Fraxiparine) was started. AT-III
   activity at that time was 56\%. Two hours before the operation, a single
   dose of 4500 IU AT-III concentrate was administered. Heparinization was
   performed with 400 IU/kg of porcine mucosal heparin, increasing the
   activated coagulation time (ACT) from a baseline of 115 to 549 s. AT-III
   activity ai that time was above 100\% and the plasma D-dimer
   concentration was 230 ng/l. ACTs during CPB remained above 999 s,
   whereas the AT-III activity dropped ro 54\% and the D-dimer increased up
   to 500 ng/l at the end of CPB. CPB was terminated uneventfully. Heparin
   was reversed with 3 mg/kg protamine chloride, decreasing the ACT to 155
   s. In the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient received
   prophylac,(dagger)ic Fraxiparine and 1500 IU AT-III, increasing the
   AT-III activity to 84\%. Postoperatively. there was continued blood
   loss, which necessitated the administration of whole blood and
   eventually re-exploration.
   The case presented illustrates an uneventful treatment of a patient with
   a hereditary AT-III deficiency undergoing CPB. In spite of an uneventful
   treatment with AT-III pre-CPB, administration of prophylactic AT-III
   concentrate after surgery should be considered with caution, as this
   might increase the postoperative morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{When deformed together in nature, calcite rocks invariably appear weaker
   and more ductile than quartz rocks. This can be reconciled with
   experimental flow data only by taking into account grain-size-sensitive
   (GSS) flow in calcite rocks, which is predicted to dominate even at
   grain sizes on the order of 1 mm at middle metamorphic grades. Using new
   experimental data that demonstrate the transition between
   intracrystalline plastic and GSS how of quartz rocks, we predict that
   unnaturally small grain sizes at temperatures of 700 degreesC or higher
   are required for GSS flow of quartz in nature. Thus natural flow of
   quartzite is expected to occur by intracrystalline plastic processes,
   even after recrystallization to a fine grain size.}},

Abstract = {{Axons in the CNS of higher vertebrates generally fail to regenerate
   after injury. This lack of regeneration is crucially influenced by
   neurite growth inhibitory protein constituents of CNS myelin. We have
   shown previously that a monoclonal antibody (mAb IN-1) capable of
   binding and neutralizing Nogo-A, a myelin-associated inhibitor of
   neurite growth, can induce long-distance axonal regeneration and
   increased structural plasticity with improved functional recovery in rat
   models of CNS injury. In this paper we demonstrate that a partially
   humanized, recombinant Fab fragment (rIN-1 Fab) derived from the
   original mAb IN-1, was able to promote long-distance regeneration of
   injured axons in the spinal cord of adult rats. When infused into a
   spinal cord injury site, regrowth of corticospinal fibers in 11 of 18
   animals was observed after a survival time of 2 weeks. Regenerating
   fibers grew for >9 mm beyond the lesion site and arborized profusely in
   the distal cord. Regenerated fibers formed terminal arbors with
   varicosities in the spinal cord gray matter, strongly resembling
   synaptic points of contact to neurons in the spinal cord distal to the
   lesion. In animals that had received a bovine serum albumin solution or
   a recombinant IN-1 fragment that had been mutated in the antigen binding
   site (mutIN-1 Fab), no significant growth beyond normal lesion-induced
   sprouting was observed. Neutralization of endogenous nerve growth
   inhibitors represents a novel use of recombinant antibody technology
   with potential therapeutic applications after traumatic CNS lesions.}},

Abstract = {{The striking emergence of an epidemic of HIV-related renal disease in
   patients with end-stage renal disease provided the rationale for the
   exploration of whether HIV-1 directly infects renal parenchymal cells.
   Renal glomerular and tubular epithelial cells contain HIV-1 mRNA and
   DNA, indicating infection by HIV-1. In addition, circularized viral DNA,
   a marker of recent nuclear import of full-length, reverse-transcribed
   RNA, was detected in the biopsies, suggesting active replication in
   renal tissue. Infiltrating infected leukocytes harbored more viral mRNA
   than renal epithelium. Identification of this novel reservoir suggests
   that effectively targeting the kidney with antiretrovirals may be
   critical for patients who are seropositive with renal disease. Thus,
   renal epithelium constitutes a unique and previously unrecognized cell
   target for HIV-1 infection.}},

Abstract = {{Stratigraphic patterns indicate that the Hercynian orogenic belt of
   northwestern Spain underwent an important reorganization in the latest
   Carboniferous Period. The passive margin of the Cantabrian foreland
   basin, initially far removed from southwestern mountains, was the early
   site of a major carbonate platform. This distant margin, however,
   experienced a late phase of deformation directed from the north.
   Limestones of the passive platform then became the thrust-faulted source
   area for three successive fan deltas, which prograded across the
   remaining carbonate shelf. The fan deltas are comprised of conglomerates
   and coarse sandstones of several areally restricted Upper Carboniferous
   formations. Their distribution identifies a local subbasin in the Picos
   de Europa Province, and paleocurrent data confirm a new northern source
   of sediment.
   These coarse-grained deposits are interpreted to have formed in direct
   response to tectonic uplift along a nearby thrust fault system. The
   stratigraphic succession spans a 7 Ma interval from latest Moscovian to
   Late Kasimovian time and defines three separate tectonic episodes: late
   Myachkovskian (304 Ma), early Chamovnicheskian (300 Ma), and early
   Dorogomilovskian (298 Ma). Rather than advancing basinward, though, the
   fan deltas shifted laterally during this period. They become younger in
   an eastward direction, that is, parallel to the structural grain, The
   underlying subregional unconformity, likewise related to thrust
   faulting, also becomes younger to the east. The thrust-fault system
   apparently propagated laterally by means of three consecutive tectonic
   episodes, which led in turn to the sideward displacement of sediment
   source area and fan-delta depocenter.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metal-sensitive `Express Orchid' petunias (Petunia xhybrida Hort
   Vilm.-Andr. `Express Orchid') were grown in substrates of 2 green yard
   waste compost : 3 peat (v/v) with target Cu contents of 100 and 200
   mg.kg(-1) at varying pH. Iron supply was also varied. Copper contents of
   the substrate were determined by H2O, NH4NO3 NH4OAc, CaCl2, CaCl2-DTPA,
   and aqua regia extraction. Plant Cu concentration increased with
   increasing Cn supply and decreasing pH, indicating that Cu
   phytoavailability depended on substrate pH. Extraction of fresh
   substrates with CaCl2-DTPA provided a good prediction of plant Cu
   concentration and reflected well the influence of pH on Cu
   phytoavailability. The percentage of CaCl2-DTPA extractable Cn increased
   with decreasing pH. Extractions of Cu with NH4NO3, H2O, NH4OAc, and
   CaCl2 resulted in very low extractable amounts and hence were not
   suitable. Plants showed Cu toxcity induced iron-like deficiency
   chlorosis, which was alleviated by additional Fe supply, This Fe supply
   did not seem to affect total Fe concentration of petunias, but reduced
   Cu concentration of the shoots. Since yield reduction was not observed,
   the occurrence of chlorosis during the culture period was chosen as the
   toxicity parameter, resulting in a Cu threshold toxcity level of 12.3
   mg(.)kg(-1) plant dry weight. From this, a threshold toxicity level for
   CaCl2-DTPA extractable Cu in compost-peat substrates of 3 mg(.)L(-1)
   substrate was determined. Chemical name used:
   diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have
   been associated with mitochondrial toxicity in individuals receiving
   treatment. A report of two deaths in Europe attributed to mitochondrial
   dysfunction in HIV-uninfected infants with perinatal NRTI exposure
   prompted a review of five U.S. cohorts.
   Methods: Deaths in HIV-exposed children <60 months of age and
   HIV-uninfected or indeterminate were reviewed. Review included birth
   history; perinatal antiretroviral drug exposure; hospital, laboratory,
   and clinic records; death reports; autopsy results; and local physician
   queries. Deaths were classified as unrelated (Class 1), unlikely related
   (Class 2), possibly related (Class 3), or highly suggestive or proven
   relationship (Class 4), to mitochondrial dysfunction; sudden infant
   death syndrome (SIDS) was categorized separately.
   Results and Conclusions: Among over 20,000 children of HIV-infected
   women, over half of whom had been exposed to NRTIs, 223 died. In
   HIV-uninfected children, 26 deaths were attributed to Class 1, and 4
   were attributed to SIDS. In HIV-indeterminate children, 141, 10, 3, and
   0 were Classes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively; 33 were due to SIDS and 6
   could not be classified. There was no indication that antiretroviral
   exposure was associated with Class 2 or 3 deaths, or deaths from SIDS.
   A. search for mitochondrial dysfunction among living children in these
   cohorts is ongoing.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient isolation of individual lipid classes is a critical step in
   the analysis of plasma and lipoprotein fatty acid compositions. Whilst
   good separations of total lipid extracts are possible by TLC, this
   method is time consuming and a major rate-limiting step when processing
   large numbers of specimens. A method for rapid separation of
   phosphatidylcholine (PC), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), cholesterol
   ester (CE) and triacylglycerol (TAG) from total plasma lipid extracts by
   solid-phase extraction (SPE) using aminopropyl silica columns has been
   developed and validated. Following initial separation of polar and
   neutral lipids, individual classes were isolated by application of
   solvents with increasing polarity. Recoveries for combined plasma
   extraction with chloroform-methanol and SPE were (\%): PC 74.2 (sd 7.5),
   NEFA 73.6 (sd 8.3), CE 84.9 (sd 4.9), and TAG 86.8 (sd 4.9), which were
   significantly greater for TAG and NEFA than by TLC (P<0.001). Both
   GC-flame ionisation detector and GC-MS analysis of fatty acid methyl
   esters demonstrated that there was no cross-contamination between lipid
   classes. Measurements of repeatability of fatty acid composition for
   TAG, PC, CE and NEFA fractions showed similar CV for each fatty acid.
   The magnitude of the CV appeared to be related inversely to the
   fractional fatty acid concentration, and was greatest at concentrations
   of less than 1 g/100 g total fatty acids. There was no evidence of
   selective elution of individual fatty acid or CE species. In conclusion,
   this method represents an efficient, rapid alternative to TLC for
   isolation of these lipid classes from plasma.}},

Title = {{Oxygen isotope systematics of the Precambrian basement of Alberta:
   implications for Paleoproterozoic and Phanerozoic tectonics in

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{We have conducted a regional survey of the oxygen isotope compositions
   of drill core samples from the Precambrian basement of the Alberta
   sedimentary basin. The majority of samples have whole-rock delta O-18
   (SMOW) values between +7 and +11 parts per thousand, as is typical of
   crustal rocks. However, there are also a significant number of samples
   with delta O-18 values less than +5 parts per thousand. In these
   samples, high-grade minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite
   commonly show retrograde alteration to chlorite and (or) epidote. The
   majority of low-delta O-18 samples are rom a 250 x 50 km zone in
   northwestern Alberta, which we refer to as the Kimiwan isotope anomaly.
   The anomaly is significant in that the most reasonable explanation for
   generating such a laterally extensive zone of rocks, with delta O-18
   values below +5 parts per thousand, is through high-temperature
   interaction with surface-derived fluids in an extensional tectonic
   setting. We propose, therefore, that the low-delta O-18 samples define a
   hitherto unrecognized extensional zone in the Alberta basement.
   Available geochronological data indicate that fluid-rock interaction and
   associated O-18 depletion occurred at ca. 1800 Ma. Oxygen and hydrogen
   isotope data on mineral separates from this zone indicate that the
   surface fluids responsible for O-18 depletion were of meteoric origin.
   Seismic reflection profiles acquired during the Lithoprobe Alberta
   Basement Transect reveal the presence of basement faults spatially
   associated with the zone of O-18 depletion. We propose that these faults
   were extensional in nature at ca. 1800 Ma. Periodic reactivation of
   these basement structures during the Phanerozoic played an important
   role in the development of faults in the overlying sedimentary basin.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of dopants (Cr, Co, Fe, Ni, Y, Er, Tb, Gd, Pr and La) on
   the crystal structure of barium titanate was studied at room temperature
   and at 250 degrees C using X-ray diffraction. Fine BaTiO3 powders (Ba/Ti
   = 1.02, size approximate to 30 nm) have been doped with 1 at\% of the
   foreign element and annealed for 14 and 62 h at two different
   temperatures: 950 and 1350 degrees C. The room temperature structure of
   doped BaTiO3 was in any case tetragonal with c/a ratio lower than in the
   undoped perovskite, but dependent on dopant nature and particle size.
   For powders calcined at 1350 degrees C, the particle size was in the
   range 1-5 mu m and the decrease in tetragonality was mainly determined
   by dopant incorporation. Powders treated at 950 degrees C had particles
   more than one order of magnitude finer (0.1-0.2 mu m) and a systematic
   lowering of the c/a ratio in comparison to the samples annealed at
   higher temperature was observed. Comparison of the experimental
   variations of the unit cell edge of cubic BaTiO3 (250 degrees C) with
   the results of atomistic computer simulations gives indication on the
   preferential incorporation site of the dopant. In particular, La3+ and
   Pr3+ prefer to substitute at the Ba site, whereas Tb3+ and Gd3+ give
   partial substitution at the Ti site. For Er3+ and Y3+ preferential
   substitution at the Ti site is predicted. For transition metal ions,
   substitution at the Ti site with oxygen vacancy compensation is
   confirmed, although their behaviour is less accurately reproduced. (C)

Abstract = {{High-resolution neutron diffraction experiments at scattering vectors up
   to 40 Angstrom (-1) have been carried out for the Ag2S-As2S3 glassy
   system in order to find differences in the network structural
   organisation within the percolation and modifier-controlled domains. No
   significant changes in the short- and intermediate-range order are found
   in the critical percolation region (x less than or equal to 1.2 at.\%
   Ag): the intensity and position of the first sharp diffraction peak
   (FSDP) exhibit relatively small changes as a function of the silver
   content, and the trigonal arsenic local coordination and two-fold
   coordinated sulphur species remain essentially intact. These
   observations agree very well with a model of host network-dependent
   percolative ion transport. In the modifier-controlled domain (x > 10-15
   at.\% Ag), one observes nearly complete disappearance of the FSDP at
   1.25-1.35 Angstrom (-1) and remarkable changes in the short-range order,
   in particular, characteristic Ag-Ag correlations at approximate to 3
   Angstrom, indicating a predominant role of Ag-containing structural
   units in the modified network organisation. These structural units and
   their interconnections seem to be similar for many silver-rich
   chalcogenide glasses, in which the Ag+ ion transport depends on the Ag
   content but not on the host matrix. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Lectin histochemistry was used to perform in situ characterization of
   the glycoconjugates present in boar testis and epididymis. Thirteen
   horseradish peroxidase- or digoxigenin-labelled lectins were used in
   samples obtained from healthy fertile boars. The acrosomes of the
   spermatids were stained intensely by lectins with affinity for galactose
   and N-acetyl-galactosamine residues, these being soybean, peanut and
   Ricinus communis agglutinins. Sertoli cells were stained selectively by
   Maackia ammurensis agglutinin. The lamina propria of seminiferous
   tubules showed the most intense staining with fucose-binding lectins.
   The Golgi area and the apical part of the principal cells of the
   epididymis were stained intensely with many lectins and their
   distribution was similar in the three zones of the epididymis. On the
   basis of lectin affinity, both testis and epididymis appear to have N-
   and O-linked glycoconjugates. Spermatozoa from different epididymal
   regions showed different expression of terminal galactose and
   N-acetyl-galactosamine. Sialic acid (specifically alpha2,3 neuraminic-5
   acid) was probably incorporated into spermatozoa along the
   extratesticular ducts. These findings indicate that the development and
   maturation of boar spermatozoa are accompanied by changes in
   glycoconjugates. As some lectins stain cellular or extracellular
   compartments specifically, these lectins could be useful markers in
   histopathological evaluation of diseases of boar testis and epididymis.}},

Abstract = {{Natural prey of Toxorhynchites rutilus (Coquillett) were identified from
   gut contents of 941 larvae collected from treeholes and tires located in
   an oak-palm woodland in south Florida. Twenty taxa of aquatic prey were
   recognized in midgut remains, in addition to eggs of Diptera from three
   families. Ostracods and chironomids were the most abundant aquatic prey
   in predators from tires, and rotifers and copepods from treeholes.
   Mosquito larvae accounted for only 6\% of prey items from treeholes and
   5\% from tires. Remains of terrestrial arthropods of nine insect orders
   plus mites and spiders were also identified, these prey having been
   captured from the water surface by T. rutilus larvae. An electivity
   coefficient, R, was calculated for dipterous prey of each predator
   instar. Significant heterogeneities among R values in tires were
   attributable, in part, to high electivity for certain mosquito species,
   especially Aedes albopictus (Skuse), and for psychodid larvae, and low
   electivity for larvae of T. rutilus and Orthopodomyia signifera
   (Coquillett), a predator-resistant mosquito larva. Diets were more
   similar between predator instars in tires than in treeholes, where
   invertebrate diversity was higher. An associated laboratory study was
   conducted to determine how long common prey could be detected in guts
   after ingestion. When alternative prey were provided immediately after
   consumption, oligochaetes, copepods, and psychodid larvae and adults
   were detected in >50\% of dissected T. rutilus for 8-18 h after
   ingestion. By contrast, if T. rutilus fourth instars were starved after
   ingesting test prey, identifiable remains of psychodid larvae were
   delectable for >30 d in most predator larvae. Thus, the assessment of T.
   rutilus diet by identification of midgut remains is highly dependent on
   the consumption of subsequent prey.}},

Abstract = {{Let X be a non-compact complete manifold (or a graph) which admits a
   quasi-pole and has bounded local geometry. Suppose that X is
   Gromov-hyperbolic and the diameters (for a fixed Gromov metric) of the
   connected components of X(infinity) have a positive lower bound. Under
   these assumptions we show that X has positive Cheeger isoperimetric
   constant. Examples are also constructed to show that the Cheeger
   constant h(X) may be zero if any of the above assumption on X is
   removed.
   Applications of this isoperimetric estimate include the solvability of
   the Dirichlet problem at infinity for non-compact Gromov-hyperbolic
   manifolds X above. In addition, we show that the Martin boundary partial
   derivative X-Delta of such a space X is homeomorphic to the geometric
   boundary X(infinity) of X at infinity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the presentation and clinical course of patients
   with tracheobronchial amyloidosis.
   Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all
   patients with biopsy-proven tracheobronchial amyloidosis who were
   evaluated at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, between 1973 and 1999,
   All relevant information, such as clinical, historical, demographic,
   laboratory, and histological data, was examined.
   Results: Tracheobronchial amyloidosis was diagnosed in 17 patients (9
   women and 8 men), with a mean age of 56.6 years. The most common
   symptoms at presentation were dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and
   hoarseness, None of the 14 patients who underwent investigation for
   systemic amyloidosis had any evidence of disease outside the
   tracheobronchial system except for a man in whom multiple myeloma had
   been diagnosed 3 years before the development of respiratory disease.
   Treatment of tracheobronchial amyloidosis consisted of laser or forceps
   resection, external radiation, systemic therapy, or observation. Two
   patients died of complications directly related to their disease.
   Conclusions: Patients presenting with tracheobronchial amyloidosis have
   symptoms similar to those caused by various airway disorders.
   Tracheobronchial amyloidosis is not typically associated with systemic
   amyloidosis or pulmonary parenchymal involvement. It often recurs and
   despite repeated attempts with bronchoscopic techniques, airway
   compromise remains a major problem.}},

Abstract = {{Accidents in developing countries are frequent and have high mortality
   and morbidity rates. In Brazil, in 1995-1996, the year of this study,
   life supporting first aid (LSFA), which includes cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation (CPR) basic life support (BLS) was not taught in schools.
   With the population of 165 million, the only way to teach the adult
   population on a large scale would be by television (TV), that is widely
   viewed. This study compares two groups of factory employees - 86
   controls without TV exposure to LSFA and 116 exposed to brief LSFA skill
   demonstrations on TV. Their ability to acquire eight LSFA skills was
   evaluated: external hemorrhage control; immobilization of a suspected
   forearm fracture: treatment of a skin burn by cold flush; body alignment
   after a fall; positioning for shock and coma: airway control by backward
   tilt of the head; and CPR (steps A-B-C). Simulated skill performance on
   the evaluating nurse or manikin was tested at 1 week, 1 month, and 13
   months. In the control group, 1-31\% performed individual skills
   correctly; as compared to 9-96\% of the television group (P < 0.001).
   There was excellent retention over 13 months. Over 50\% of the
   television group performed correctly five of the eight skills, including
   positioning and hemorrhage control. Television viewing increased correct
   airway control performance from 5 to 25\% of trainees, while it remained
   at 3\% in the control group. CPR-ABC performance, however, was very poor
   in both groups. We conclude that a significant proportion of factory
   workers can acquire simple LSFA skills through television viewing alone,
   except for the skill acquisition of CPR steps B (mouth-to-mouth
   ventilation) and C (external chest compressions) which need coached
   manikin practice. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Ten patients, who had been treated according to the Malmo model for
   immune tolerance induction (ITI), were analysed regarding treatment with
   clotting factors and chemotherapy during the time period between
   inhibitor detection and ITI. Of the patients who were successfully
   rendered tolerant (n = 6) all but one had received treatment with FVIII,
   either alone (n = 1), or combined with cyclophosphamide (n = 4). Of the
   patients who did not become tolerant, three of four had received
   treatment with FVIII during the inhibitor period but only one with FVIII
   and chemotherapy. The total amount of treatment received was in general
   much lower in the group that did not become tolerant. In individual
   cases, it appeared very clear that the inhibitor level and anamnestic
   response was substantially reduced prior to the ITI using the Malmo
   treatment model. We conclude that treatment of acute bleeds during the
   inhibitor period may be of importance for ITI and that the different
   response rates published for different immune tolerance regimens most
   likely do not reflect the true response rate for the respective regimen.}},

Abstract = {{The underlying causes for different apoptotic responses in neoplastic
   cells are still not fully understood. We demonstrate here that a human
   breast cancer cell line, MDA-ME-468, which lacks the retinoblastoma
   protein (RB), is particularly sensitive to low doses of ultraviolet (UV)
   radiation. These cells are 15-20-fold more sensitive to UV radiation
   than RE-positive cell lines, as measured by both apoptosis and
   clonogenic assays. In addition, a prostate cancer cell line that lacks
   functional RE, DU-145, was found to have a similar apoptotic response to
   low doses of UV radiation. Based on these data, we hypothesized that the
   lack of RE is responsible for the extreme sensitivity of these cells to
   UV-radiation-induced apoptosis, To further examine the role of RE in
   apoptosis, cells of RE-positive human breast cancer and normal cell
   lines were infected with the human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) E7
   and assessed for UV-radiation sensitivity, The HPV-16 E7 protein is
   known to decrease levels of free RE in cells. Infection of RE-positive
   human breast cancer or normal cells with E7 resulted in a 4-5-fold
   increase in sensitivity to UV radiation compared to controls. The above
   data suggest a role for the RE protein in protecting cells from
   undergoing apoptosis in response to UV radiation. (C) 2000 by Radiation

Abstract = {{Sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids), with its complex polyploid genome,
   is not well understood at the genetic level. Partial sequencing of
   anonymous cDNA clones is a widely used technique for gene
   identification. These partial cDNA sequences, or Expressed Sequence Tags
   (ESTs) have potential application for the identification of important
   genes for genetic manipulation. This study aimed to initiate the
   preliminary development of an EST database for sugarcane and thereby
   gain some potentially useful information on sugarcane gene sequences. A
   nondirectional cDNA library has been constructed from sugarcane leaf
   roll (meristematic region) tissue. Two hundred fifty clones have been
   randomly selected, subjected to single-pass sequencing from the 5' end
   of the vector, and identified by sequence similarity searches against
   gene sequences in international databases. Of the 250 leaf roll clones,
   26\% exhibit similarity to known plant genes, 50\% to non-plant genes,
   while 24\% represent new gene sequences. Analysis of the identified
   clones indicated sequence similarity to a broad diversity of genes
   encoding proteins such as enzymes, structural proteins, and regulatory
   factors. A significant proportion of genes identified in the leaf roll
   were involved in processes related to protein synthesis and protein
   modification, as would be expected in meristematic tissues. These
   results present a successful application of EST analysis in sugarcane
   and provide a preliminary indication of gene expression in leaf roll
   tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare malignant tumor
   and little is known about its clinical features and management. We
   report on a series of 19 pediatric patients managed over 20 years.
   Patients and methods: Primary conservative surgery was performed in all
   patients and was radical in nine, non-radical in three; seven patients
   underwent biopsy alone (3 unresectable tumors, 4 metastatic disease). In
   two cases radical surgery was performed after primary chemotherapy.
   Radiotherapy was delivered to 8 patients, chemotherapy to 15.
   Results: After a median follow-up of 74 months, the five-year survival
   was 80\% for the whole series, 91\% for patients with localized disease,
   100\% for patients with tumor less than or equal to5 cm, and 31\% for
   those >5 cm; 16 of 19 patients were alive (12 of 12 with
   grossly-resected tumor in first continuous remission). Chemotherapy
   achieved two partial remission among seven evaluable patients.
   Conclusions: Pediatric ASPS has a more favorable prognosis than its
   adult counterpart. In this series, tumor size correlates with metastatic
   disease at onset and is the major factor influencing survival. Surgery
   is the mainstay of therapy. The effectiveness of adjuvant therapy
   remains to be established, though radiotherapy may be advisable in cases
   of inadequate surgery.}},

Abstract = {{A series of commercially available iron-containing pigments (red or
   yellow ochre and green earths) has been primarily investigated by means
   of Mossbauer spectroscopy. The quantitative distribution of iron among
   various sites, and the iron(II) to iron(III) ratio were determined.
   FT-IR, SEM and EDX microscopy and XRD diffractometry have also been used
   for a more appropriate analytical identification and physico-chemical
   classification of the examined pigments. The pigments were divided into
   various groups according to their physico-chemical properties and
   compared with the data obtained on wall painting samples, prepared in
   the laboratory as reference, and on fragments from frescoes by Piero
   della Francesca (S. Francesco Church in Arezzo), G. F. Bembo, G.
   Romanino, R. Boccacino (Cathedral in Cremona) and G. Vasari and F.
   Zuccari (Cathedral in Florence). It was found that the commercially
   available samples, although synthetic, are not pure products and may
   contain additional compounds or additional iron derivatives. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The mixed-lineage leukemia gene (MLL) is associated more than 25
   chromosomal translocations involving 11q23 in diverse subtypes of human
   acute leukemia. Conditional expression of a 50 kDa amino terminal
   fragment spanning the AT hook motifs of MLL (MLL3AT) causes cell cycle
   arrest, upregulation of p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) and partial monocytic
   differentiation of the monoblastic U937 cell line. suggesting a major
   role for MLL3AT in MLL-AF9-induced myelomonocytic differentiation. In
   this study, we analyzed the subcellular localization of conditionally
   expressed MLL3AT in both U937 and HeLa cell lines. Immunofluorescence
   staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunoelectron
   microscopy indicated that MLL3AT, like endogenous MLL, localized in the
   nucleoplasm in a punctate pattern of distribution, including regions
   attached to the nuclear envelope and the periphery of the nucleolus. We
   found that MLL3AT and endogenous MLL were present in interphase nuclear
   matrices and colocalized with topoisomerase II to mitotic chromosomal
   scaffolds. Nucleoplasm and nucleolar localization was observed even for
   MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 conditionally expressed chimeric proteins,
   suggesting a common target conferred by the amino terminus of MLL to
   many if not all the chimeric MLL proteins. The nuclear matrix/scaffold
   association suggests a role for the amino terminus of MLL in the
   modulation of chromatin structure, leading to epigenetic effects on the
   maintenance of gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Home care of tracheostomized children is considered a safe
   and low-cost alternative. Aim: To report the experience with
   tracheostomized children at the Pediatric Respiratory Unit of the
   Catholic University Hospital. Patients and methods: The records of 16
   children (9 male) with tracheostomy (TQ) in home care between 1992 and
   1998 were reviewed. Results: The average age at the moment of TQ was 9
   months (range 1-30 months) and the postoperative hospital management
   period was 5 months (range 1-11 months). The average age at discharge
   was 13 months ( range 3 to 30 months). Surgical indication were upper
   airway obstruction (congenitial or acquired subglotic stenosis in three,
   upper airway malformations in one, vocal palsy in one and
   tracheohomalacia in one) and chronic assisted ventilation (severe
   tracheobronchomalacia in four, pulmonary hypoplasia in two, myopathy in
   one, central nervous injury in one and bronchopulmonary displasia in
   one). Overall rate complications were 2 per 100 tracheostomy months
   during home care and 8 per 100 tracheostomy months during home care and
   8 per 100 tracheostomy months during hospital care. No
   tracheostomy-related deaths were observed. A parenteral education
   program to teach about tracheostomy management and cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation carries out. Conclusions: Tracheostomized children can be
   safely managed at home.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Occupational exposure to various neurotoxic chemicals can impair color
   vision. We evaluated this possibility in toluene-exposed workers.
   Thirty-three rubber workers and 16 referents were studied. We estimated
   toluene exposure by measuring urinary excretion of the unmodified form
   of the solvent (i.e., TolU). Color vision was tested with the Lanthony
   D-15 desaturated panel, and the outcomes were expressed quantitatively
   with the Color Confusion Index and the Total Confusion Index.
   Toluene-exposed workers had a subclinical reduction in color vision,
   compared with referents. We related this effect to solvent cumulative
   exposure-estimated as the product of urinary excretion of unmodified
   toluene by previous toluene exposure duration. This approach supports
   the hypothesis that impairment progresses as exposure continues. In the
   examined group of workers, toluene exposure was within the occupational
   limit proposed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial
   Hygienists. The observed loss in color vision raises doubts on the real
   protection afforded by this limit-at least for effects of the solvent on
   the eyes. Finally, the Total Confusion Index was a more sensitive index
   than the Color Confusion Index in the evaluation of toluene-related
   color-vision impairment, suggesting that this index should be adopted in
   future studies of the effects of chemicals on color perception.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{4593-4599}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Organic ligands containing the thiol (-SH) metal-chelating functionality
   were either grafted to the external surface silanol groups of sepiolite
   or introduced in the interlayers of montmorillonite, and the resulting
   functionalized clays were characterized and assayed as adsorbents for
   Hg(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) ions from solution. Sepiolite was
   functionalized by covalently grafting 3-mercapto-pro-pyltrimethoxysilane
   (MPS) to the surface =SI-OH groups of the clay, whereas montmorillonite
   was functionalized by replacement of the interlayer inorganic cation
   (Na+) by 2-mercaptoethylammonium (MEA) cations. These clay-organic
   ligand systems were selected to minimize the congestion of the internal
   porosity of the clays, which has recently been shown to be the main
   obstacle to heavy metal adsorption by functionalized clays. Infrared
   spectroscopy and elemental analyses demonstrated the presence of the
   organic ligands in the modified clays. X-ray diffraction analysis
   indicated the organic cations (MEA) occupied the interlayers of
   montmorillonite. N-2 specific surface area measurements suggested that
   much of the surface area of montmorillonite and sepiolite remained
   accessible upon functionalization and that the organic ligand kept the
   montmorillonite interlayers open. The functionalized clays adsorbed most
   of the Hg(II) ions present in solution up to saturation and were also
   good adsorbents of Ph(II) at low metal ion concentrations (i.e., <0.02
   mM). They were, however, less effective toward Pb(II) and Zn(II) at high
   metal ion concentrations. The presence of NaNO3 or Ca(NO3)(2)<bullet>(.)
   as background electrolytes at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 0.1 M
   did not alter the great adsorption capacity of functionalized sepiolite
   for Hg(II). The results show that clay functionalization can be
   optimized by matching clay structure with a suitable reactive
   (i.e.,fibrous clay with a graftable ligand or expandable clay with an
   exchangeable cationic ligand) and minimizing the gallery volume taken up
   by the organic ligand, thus improving the performance of the
   functionalized clay as adsorbent of heavy metals from solution.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of aging on
   athletes' cardiorespiratory responses to a brief intense intermittent
   effort, using the force-velocity test as an exercise model, Twelve young
   athletes (23.8 +/- 1.3 years) and twelve master athletes (65.1 +/- 1.2
   years) with similar heights, body masses, and endurance training
   schedules participated in this study. They performed both a maximal
   graded exercise and the force-velocity tests. The force-velocity test
   consisted of the repetition of 6-second sprints against increasing
   braking forces with 5-minute recovery periods. None of the subjects
   presented abnormal electrocardiogram responses to the tests, During the
   force-velocity test, the heart rate magnitudes of response in all
   subjects were correlated to the corresponding sprint power output (p <
   .001), with higher values for the young athletes (p < .001). Both groups
   had similar systolic blood pressure peaks of response during the
   force-velocity test. Both groups had similar preexercise and
   end-of-recovery oxygen consumption ((V)over dotO(2)), but the young
   athletes had higher peaks of response (p < .001). The (V)over dot
   magnitudes of response increased during the test (p < .01) in all
   subjects, with higher values for the young athletes (p < .001). There
   was a positive correlation between the (V)over dotO(2) magnitude of
   response and (1) the corresponding sprint power output (R = .58, p <
   .001) and (2) the corresponding number of sprint repetitions (R = .29, p
   < .02), The young athletes had higher end-of-recovery and peak carbon
   dioxide production ((V)over dotCO(2)) responses than the master athletes
   (p < .001). Pulmonary ventilation (VE) peaks of response to the sprints
   were higher in the young athletes (p < .001), There was a positive
   relation between the V-E and (V)over dotCO(2) peaks of response (R =
   .84,p < .001). In both groups the peak heart rate, (V)over dotO(2),
   (V)over dotCO(2), and V-E values attained during the force-velocity test
   represented similar percentages of the maximal values reached at
   exhaustion of maximal graded exercise. These results showed that aging
   does not alter the percentage of the cardiorespiratory response to a
   brief intense intermittent exercise such as the force-velocity test.
   Moreover, the arterial blood pressure response is not significantly
   altered, whereas the vasodilatatory response is.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional stage controllers (CSC) for interior environment control of
   agricultural facilities are prevalent and well suited for slowly varying
   loads, smaller facilities with few stages of control, and in cases where
   ``discrete proportional control{''} is deemed adequate. Ad hoc
   implementation schemes for using the same CSC over a range in size of
   building heating and ventilating systems, from one hearing and cooling
   stage to many are practiced in the industry. A fuzzy logic controller
   (FLC) was developed to satisfy a broad spectrum of installation sizes
   without any modification. Principles for designing an environment
   controller that can mimic CSC behavior over a broad range of system size
   were applied. By adjusting a single additional input this controller
   provides users with a trade-off between energy use and control
   precision. Simulations were conducted using the same FLC in a greenhouse
   and a broiler house; these two examples were selected for their
   considerable difference in magnitude of energy transfer and loads.
   Disturbances investigated included: variations in outside temperature,
   internal heat load (or solar load), and step changes in set point
   temperature. FLC system responses are compared with a representative CSC
   for stability, overshoot and mean square error from set point
   temperature. The FLC was able to keep the root-mean-square errors to 1.0
   to 4.0 degreesC, depending on different energy use settings. The FLC
   provided useful improvements in performance over a CSC, and is readily
   implemented in modem electronic controllers with floating point
   arithmetic capability.}},

Abstract = {{Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the highly
   vascularised supporting tissues of the teeth. Little is known about the
   vascular changes in untreated advanced periodontitis, Using confocal
   immunofluorescence microscopy and morphometry, we defined and quantified
   vascular remodelling in this lesion. In the connective tissue subjacent
   to the altered epithelium lining of the periodontal pocket, there was a
   significant increase in the numerical density of vascular profiles,
   primarily accounted for by vessels greater than or equal to 25 mu m in
   diameter. In addition, Vascular basement membranes were thickened and
   there was accumulation of non-vascular basement membrane remnants. We
   investigated the distribution of major angiogenic growth factors in
   periodontitis using immunohistochemistry. Basic fibroblast growth
   factor, although consistently associated with blood vessels, showed no
   regional variation in its distribution. In contrast, there was a marked
   regional variation in the intensity of immunostaining for vascular
   endothelial growth factor, with significantly reduced staining of the
   pocket epithelium. The changes in the vascularity of the periodontal
   connective tissues in untreated advanced periodontitis may be, in part,
   a consequence of altered expression of angiogenic activity by the
   epithelium, In turn, this may reflect the epithelial response to
   microbial flora in the microenvironment of the periodontal pocket.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments were conducted in the Prachinburi Rice Research Center
   (Thailand) from 1994 to 1998. The major objective was to study methane
   (CH(4)) emission from deepwater rice as affected by different crop
   management. Irrigated rice was investigated in adjacent plots, mainly
   for comparison purposes. The 4-yr average in CH(4) emission from
   deepwater rice with straw ash (burned straw) treatment was 46 mg
   m(-2)d(-1) and total emission was 98 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). For irrigated
   rice, the average emission rate and total emission for the straw ash
   treatment was 79 mg m(-2) d(-)1 and 74 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively.
   Low emission rates may partially be related to acid sulfate soil of the
   experimental site. Without organic amendment, the seasonal pattern of
   CH(4) emission from deepwater rice was correlated with an increase in
   biomass of rice plants. Emission rates from deepwater rice depend on the
   production of biomass and the straw management as well. Methane emission
   was greatest with straw incorporation, followed by straw compost
   incorporation, zero-tillage with straw mulching, and least with straw
   ash incorporation. The seasonal pattern of CH(4) ebullition in deepwater
   rice was consistent with seasonal emission, and total ebullition
   corresponded to 50\% of total emission. Dissolved CH(4) concentrations
   in the surface soil (0-5 cm) were similar to those in the subsoil (5-15
   cm), and the seasonal fluctuation of dissolved CH(4) was also consistent
   with the seasonal CH(4) emission. Increase in plant density and biomass
   of irrigated rice grown by pregerminated seed broadcasting enhanced
   CH(4) emission as compared with transplanting.}},

Title = {{Radiation effects in spheroids of cells exposed to alpha emitters}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1555-1564}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To simulate spheroids of cells and use the spheroid models to
   establish methods of calculating cell survival following exposure to
   alpha irradiation from decays of At-211 and Bi-213.
   Methods: Using a Monte Carlo technique, two models of spheroids of cells
   were generated in which cells either did not or were allowed to overlap.
   At 40\% packing of the volume it is shown that the two models are
   equivalent for longer-ranged alpha particles. The overlapping model was
   used to examine the effects of spheroid size and cell packing on cell
   survival. Cell survival was also calculated for different distributions
   of alpha decays such as uniform distribution within the spheroid,
   external to the spheroid and as a shell on the periphery of the
   spheroid.
   Results: Three examples of the cell structure of the spheroids are
   shown. Detailed calculations show that cell survival decreases from 57\%
   to 37\% as the spheroid diameter increases from 75 mum to 225 mum for an
   average of one At-211 decay per cell and 50\% packing. Increasing the
   packing of the cells in the spheroid from 40\% to 70\% reduces survival
   from 46\% to 26\% for 200 mum diameter spheroids for one At-211 or
   Bi-213 decay per cell. The presence of small regions of unlabelled cells
   within the spheroids does not significantly change cell survival.
   Conclusions: Monte Carlo programmes generating spheroids of cells and
   their subsequent use to score cell survival for alpha irradiation should
   be useful in the design and interpretation of work on spheroids of cells
   in vitro and the application of such modelling to the study of very
   small tumours in vivo. Copies of the programmes are available from the
   author on request.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We assess clinical and urodynamic results of sacral nerve
   stimulation for patients with neurogenic (spinal cord diseases) urge
   incontinence and detrusor hyperreflexia resistant to parasympatholytic
   drugs.
   Materials and Methods: Since 1992, 9 women with a mean age of 42.6 years
   (range 26 to 53) were treated for refractory neurogenic urge
   incontinence with sacral nerve stimulation. Neurological spinal diseases
   included viral and vascular myelitis in 1 patient each, multiple
   sclerosis in 5 and traumatic spinal cord injury in 2. Mean time since
   neurological diagnosis was 12 years. All patients had incontinence with
   chronic pad use related to detrusor hyperreflexia. Intermittent
   self-catheterization for external detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia was
   used by 5 patients. Social life was impaired and these patients were
   candidates for bladder augmentation. A sacral (S3) lead was surgically
   implanted and connected to a subcutaneous neurostimulator after a
   positive test stimulation trial.
   Results: Mean followup was 43.6 months (range 7 to 72). All patients had
   clinically significant improvement of incontinence, and 5 were
   completely dry. Average number of voids per day decreased from 16.1 to
   8.2. Urodynamic parameters at 6 months after implant improved
   significantly from baseline, including maximum bladder capacity from 244
   to 377 ml. and volume at first uninhibited contraction from 214 to 340
   ml. Maximum detrusor pressure at first uninhibited contraction increased
   in 3, stabilized in 2 and decreased in 4 patients. Urodynamic results
   returned to baseline when stimulation was inactivated. All patients
   subjectively reported improved visual analog scale results by at least
   75\% at last followup.
   Conclusions: Sacral nerve stimulation can be used as a reversible
   treatment option for refractory urge incontinence related to detrusor
   hyperreflexia in select patients with spinal lesions.}},

Abstract = {{A Pichia pastoris expression system for bovine pancreatic RNase A was
   constructed: the RNase A sequence was fused to the PHO1 signal and the
   AOX1 promoter was used for efficient secretion. Approximately 5 mg of
   soluble enzymes were secreted per liter of the culture, but one half of
   them were glycosylated. After a series of purifications by
   cation-exchange chromatography, the glycosylated enzyme was removed and
   the pure recombinant soluble unglycosylated RNase A was obtained in the
   final yield of 1 mg per liter of the culture. N-Terminal sequence,
   molecular weight, secondary structure, thermal stability, and activity
   were completely identical with those of commercial RNase A. Glycosylated
   RNase A had a decreased k(cat), 60-70\% of the activity of wildtype
   RNase A, as in the case of RNase B. Its carbohydrate moiety seemed tb
   destabilize the enzyme differently from RNase B since T-m of the
   glycosylated RNase A was decreased by 6 degreesC. The carbohydrate
   moiety of the glycosylated enzyme contained no GlcNAc, The N34A mutant
   RNase A, in which the only potential N-glycosylation site, Asn34, is
   mutated to alanine, was also glycosylated, implying that glycosylation
   is not N-linked but O-linked.}},

Abstract = {{There are two popular optic designs for x-ray space telescopes: the
   traditional monolithic design, which has demonstrated subarcsecond
   resolution but at enormous weight and cost per collecting area, and the
   foil design, which has achieved far greater collecting area per weight
   and cost, but with resolution limited to the arcminute level, in part
   due to foil assembly inaccuracy. In this article, we present the design
   and the fabrication of a novel micromechanical device, the so-called
   microcomb, which is used to assemble high-accuracy foil x-ray optics. To
   achieve submicron foil alignment accuracy, two types of microcombs have
   been fabricated via microelectromechanical systems technology. Reference
   combs provide highly accurate single-point contacts against which foils
   are registered, and spring combs provide the mechanical actuation needed
   to properly position and shape the foils. Briefly, we introduce some
   basic concepts regarding grazing-incidence x-ray optics. We then present
   a theoretical model that has given rise to the unique shape of the
   spring microcomb. Finally, the fabrication process used to produce the
   microcombs is discussed. (C) 2000 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the mechanical properties of interlevel dielectric films
   and their impact on submicron interconnect reliability is becoming more
   and more important as critical dimensions in ultralarge scale integrated
   circuits are scaled down. For example, lateral aluminum (Al) extrusions
   into spaces between metal lines, which become more of a concern as the
   pitches shrink, appear to depend partially on properties of SiO2
   underlayers. In this article nanoindentation, wafer curvature, and
   infrared absorbance techniques have been used to study the mechanical
   propel-ties of several common interlevel dielectric SiO2 films such as
   undoped silica glass using a silane (SiH4) precursor, undoped silica
   glass using a tetraethylorthosilicate precursor, phosphosilicate glass
   deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and
   borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) deposited by subatmosphere chemical
   vapor deposition. The elastic modulus E and hardness H of the
   as-deposited and densified SiO2 layers are measured by nanoindentation.
   The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the densified layers are
   estimated by temperature-dependent wafer curvature measurements. Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy is used to obtain the chemical
   structures of all SiO2 layers. Among the four common interlevel layers,
   BPSG exhibits the smallest modulus/ hardness and a relatively small
   amount of moisture loss during anneal. The BPSG shows the highest CTE,
   which generates the smallest thermal stress due to a closer match in the
   CTE between Al and SiO2. BPSG again has the lowest as-deposited
   compressive stress and the lowest local Si-O-Si strain before annealing.
   The center frequency of the Si-O bond stretching vibration exhibits a
   linear dependence on total film stress. The shifts of Si-O peaks for all
   the SiO2 layers also correlate well with the stress hysteresis obtained
   from wafer curvature measurements. Stress interactions between the
   various SiO2 underlayers and the Al metal film are also investigated.
   The impact of dielectric elastic properties on interconnect reliability
   during thermal cycles is proposed. (C) 2000 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the kinetic foundation of extended
   irreversible thermodynamics via the moment method. First we consider the
   construct of the 1-particle distribution function f in terms of its
   moments by maximizing the entropy density function. We then project f
   from its L-2 space onto the local thermodynamic variables
   z=(z(1),...,z(N)) in the thermodynamic base space (B) over cap (N). Thus
   instead of the Boltzmann equation we consider a set of evolution
   equations of z in (B) over cap (N). Second, we formulate the laws of
   thermodynamics governing the variable z in (B) over cap (N). These laws
   exhibit an intrinsic geometric structure of thermodynamics in the
   setting of contact geometry. Finally, as an illustration, we discuss the
   evolution equations for the bulk pressure P-b, heat flux Q, and the
   symmetric traceless tensor <(<pi>)over left right arrow> corresponding
   to the viscous and heat conduction irreversible processes. These
   equations can be formulated as an abstract inhomogeneous hyperbolic
   evolution equation. By employing the C-0 semigroup technique, we discuss
   the solution of the evolution equation and its asymptotic behavior. We
   show that thermodynamic stability condition of the system implies
   asymptotic dynamical stability of the solution and vice versa. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{High-performance aerospace composite manufacturing of
   carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components makes use of release
   films during standard cure processes. After removal of a release film,
   unwanted residue from the film has been known to decrease the bond
   strength of adhesive joints in CFRP parts. Electron spectroscopy for
   chemical analysis (ESCA) has been used as a relatively non-destructive
   surface analysis technique to determine the atomic composition and
   chemical species present on the CFRP surfaces. The identification of the
   chemical species present on the surface can lead to a better
   understanding of the overall bond structure and functional composition
   of the elements in a given surface, distinct from the bulk chemistry of
   the substrate. In this study, ESCA analyses were done on CFRP surfaces
   prepared with two different fluoropolymer release films: fluorinated
   ethylene-propylene (FEP) and ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE).
   Differences in the high-resolution spectra were used to determine the
   amount of fluoropolymer transferred to the CFRP surface after removal of
   the release films. The ESCA quantification showed that FEP release films
   transferred less material than ETFE release films to the surface of the
   cured CFRPs. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Isolated heart models separate cardiac characteristics from
   systemic characteristics with subsequent findings used in cardiac
   research, including responses to pharmacologic, mechanical, and
   electrical components. The model objective was to develop the ability to
   represent in situ physiologic cardiac function ex vivo.
   Methods. Swine hearts were chosen over rat or guinea pig models due to
   their notably greater anatomical and physiologic similarities to humans.
   An in vitro apparatus was designed to work all four chambers under
   simulated in situ physiologic conditions. Using standard cardiac
   surgical techniques, 12 porcine hearts (mean weight 331 +/- 18 g) were
   explanted into the apparatus. Preload and afterload resistances
   simulated in situ input and output physiologic conditions. Hemodynamic
   characterizations, including cardiac output, max +/-dP/dt, and heart
   rate, were used to determine in situ function leading to explantation
   (prethoracic operation, postmedial sternotomy, and postperidectomy) and
   during in vitro function (t = 0, 60, 120, and 240 minutes).
   Results. In vitro performance decayed with time, with statistical
   differences from base line (t = 0) function at t = 240 minutes (p >

   Conclusions. An isolation and in vitro explantation protocol has been
   improved to aid in the study of isolated cardiac responses, and to
   determine cardiac hemodynamic function during open chest operation,
   transplantation, and in vitro reanimation with a crystalloid perfusate.
   The resulting model offers similar working physiologic function, with
   real-time imaging capabilities. The resulting model is advantageous in
   representing human cardiac function with regard to anatomic and
   physiologic functions, and can account for atrial and ventricular
   interactions. (Ann Thorac Surg 2000 70:1607-14) (C) 2000 by The Society

Abstract = {{The chemical composition and clotting properties of milk from 45
   Modicana (Mo) and Holstein (Ho) cows were assessed over the winter
   (December and January) and spring periods (March-April). The cows came
   from 4 farms of the Ragusa region (Italy). Considerable differences in
   milk yield, milk composition and clotting properties were noted between
   breeds. During the winter and spring periods, Mo and Ho produced an
   average 15.4 and 35.8 kg.day(-1) of milk, respectively. The Mo milk
   contained significantly more fat (+5.8 g.kg(-1)), nitrogen (+5.9
   g.kg(-1)) and lactose (+1.9 g.kg(-1)). The casein/true protein ratio was
   also higher in Mo milk (+3.5\%) and the plasmin content was 87\% lower.
   The fatty acid composition was the same in both breeds. The pH of the Mo
   milk was lower (-0.07), coagulation time and curd firming rate were
   quicker (32 and 53\% respectively) and the curd was firmer (+50\%). The
   results obtained during the spring period were very close to those of
   the winter period. For a same nitrogen content, the Mo milk produced a
   16\% firmer curd than the Ho milk, probably due to its higher
   casein/protein ratio and its higher content of casein kappa variant B
   (75 and 28\% for Mo and Ho cows respectively).}},

Abstract = {{Infrared absorption bands due to OH- molecular ions have been
   investigated in single crystals of CdWO4. The peak positions of these
   OH- absorptions depend strongly on the nature of the adjacent entity
   (either an impurity or vacancy) responsible for trapping the proton. Six
   OH- spectra were observed in the undoped, and intentionally doped CdWO4
   crystals included in our study. The respective trapping entities are the
   monovalent impurity ions Li+, Na+ and Cu+ substituting for the Cd2+
   ions, the pentavalent impurities Nb5+ and Ta5+ substituting for the W6+
   ions, and the Cd vacancies. Peak positions and widths of the individual
   absorption bands were monitored as a function of temperature, Electron
   paramagnetic resonance (EPR) helped assign specific absorption bands to
   the Cu+-OH- and V-Cd-OH- centers. A 900 degrees C thermal anneal in air
   converted the Cu+-OH- centers to Cu2+ ions (observable with EPR),
   illuminating a crystal with 325 nm light at temperatures near 90 K
   caused a hole to be trapped adjacent to a V-Cd-OH- center, thus forming
   an h(+)-V-Cd-OH- center, which was observable with EPR also. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Background. Considerable evidence exists that neurotoxicity of
   excitatory amino acids is related to the neuronal injury, including
   paraplegia. However, little is known about aspartate neurotoxicity in
   the spinal cord in vivo. We evaluated the detrimental effects of
   exogenous aspartate on spinal cord neurons under metabolic stress.
   Methods. New Zealand white rabbits underwent an infrarenal aortic
   isolation. Group A animals (n = 7) received segmental aspartate 50
   mmol/L) infusion for 10 minutes. Group B animals (n = 7) received saline
   as a negative control. Group C animals (n = 5) received segmental
   aspartate 100 mmol/L) infusion for 5 minutes. Group D animals (n = 7)
   were pretreated with segmental infusion of
   (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo{[}a,d]cycloheptan-5,10-imine
   (MK-801) (6 mg/kg), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
   receptor antagonist for 1 minute, followed by segmental infusion of
   aspartate (50 mmol/L) for 9 minutes. Group E animals (n = 7) received
   vehicle only, followed by aspartate (50 mmol/L) infusion as a control of
   group D. Neurologic status was assessed at 12, 24, and 48 hours after
   operation using the Tarlov score.
   Results. Group A animals exhibited paraplegia or paraparesis with marked
   neuronal necrosis. Group B and C animals recovered fully. Group D
   animals showed significantly better neurologic function (p = 0.0007)
   compared with group E animals that exhibited paraplegia or paraparesis.
   Conclusions. Exogenous aspartate can have detrimental effects on spinal
   cord neurons under metabolic stress. This model may be useful in
   assaying neuronal injury mediated by NMDA receptor in vivo. (Ann Thorac

Abstract = {{The relevance of an elevated base deficit (BD) during the fluid
   resuscitation of a thermally injured patient is not completely
   understood. After nonthermal trauma, early elevation of the BD
   represents insufficient cellular perfusion and is ultimately associated
   with a higher incidence of organ dysfunction and death. However, this
   relationship has not been completely examined after burn injuries. The
   purpose of this study was to determine if elevation of the BD during
   burn resuscitation was associated with potential consequences of
   malperfusion, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute
   respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction. The
   records of 72 patients with burn injuries (mean age, 46 +/- 17 years;
   mean total body surface area burned, 44\% +/- 18\%) who required fluid
   resuscitation on admission to an adult regional burn center were
   analyzed. Patients with a mean BD of less than -6 mmol/L during the
   first 24 hours were compared with patients with a mean BD of more than
   -6 mmol/L. Despite adequate resuscitation with good maintenance of
   urinary output, the patients in the group with a mean BD of less than -6
   mmol/L had more florid systemic inflammatory response syndrome (P =
   .004), had more prevalent acute respiratory distress syndrome (P =
   .012), and experienced more severe multiple organ dysfunction (P < .001)
   compared with patients in the group with a mean BD of more than -6
   mmol/L. The results suggest that abnormal elevation of the BD after burn
   injuries represents a malperfusion state, which may not be recognized if
   only ``traditional{''} parameters, such as UO, are followed.
   Furthermore, this state appears to be related to the onset of more
   severe systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.}},

Volume = {{69}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Sporadically eruptive house mouse populations provide an opportunity
   to test ideas about how intrinsic and extrinsic factors interact to
   limit rodent populations. New Zealand house mouse populations inhabiting
   beech forests and associated mosaics erupt when autumn beech seedfall is
   high. We analysed 25 years of data on mouse density and beech seedfall
   from a beech and podocarp/hardwood forest mosaic in New Zealand to test
   the effects of mouse density, beech seedfall and rat density on rates of
   change in mouse abundance, estimated as the rate of change in a density
   index for sequential seasonal transitions (r).
   2. For autumn to winter and winter to spring transitions, I was related
   to the magnitude of autumn seedfall and mouse density at the start of
   each transition, regardless of whether forest types were considered
   separately or together. For spring to summer and summer to autumn
   transitions, r. was related to mouse density alone. Density dependence
   could reflect the influence of intrinsic social factors, intraspecific
   competition for food, or the effects of parasites, diseases or
   predators.
   3. We modified a conceptual model of variation in rodent reproductive
   effort to derive a general model of how numerical responses to
   density-independent increases in food availability, modified by
   density-dependent mechanisms and extrinsic precursors to population
   increase, drive sporadic eruptions in the density of some rodent
   populations. For house mice in New Zealand, the numerical response to
   seedfall was modified by some unidentified density-dependent
   mechanism(s) to generate sporadic eruptions. Extrinsic precursors to
   population increase appear to be important in other eruptive house mouse
   populations.
   4. House mouse density in beech forest was more volatile than in
   podocarp/hardwood forest, maximum rates of increase and decrease being
   higher in the former. Density tended to be higher in podocarp/hardwood
   forest when overall density was low, and higher in beech forest when
   overall density was high. This suggests that between eruptions, mice
   persist in podocarp/hardwood forest at higher densities than in
   adjoining beech forest.}},

Abstract = {{A novel gene highly expressed in thyroid cancer, designated TC-1
   (thyroid cancer-1), was cloned from suppression subtractive
   hybridization between papillary thyroid carcinoma and its surrounding
   normal thyroid tissue. Overexpression of TC-1 in thyroid cancer was
   confirmed in 15/16 paired samples by RT-PCR and Northern analysis.
   Ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, the TC-1 sequence showed no
   homology to any known gene, but matched a cluster of ESTs, After
   alignment of our sequence with the ESTs, the missing transcription start
   site was obtained by 5'-RACE and verified by primer extension analysis.
   The full-length mRNA sequence of 1327 bp has an open reading frame of
   321 bp, which encodes a highly conserved protein. Three regulatory
   motifs were identified at the expected positions within 1 kb of the 5'
   flanking sequence obtained by genome walking. Using fluorescence in situ
   hybridization, TC-1 was localized to chromosome 8p11.2. The
   overexpression of TC-1 in papillary carcinoma suggests that it may have
   an important role in thyroid carcinogenesis. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{During the outbreak of Nipah virus encephalitis in Malaysia, stored

   associated with poor prognosis. In addition, there was a positive linear
   correlation of CSF virus isolation with age. There was no significant
   association between CSF virus isolation and the character of the CSF,
   presence of Nipah-specific antibody in the serum or CSF, duration of
   illness before collection of samples, or sex or ethnicity of the
   patients. This study suggests that high vital replication in the central

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: A family history of colorectal cancer is an important risk
   factor for the disease. a positive family history means that endoscopic
   screening should be recommended and a strongly positive family history
   raises the possibility of a dominantly inherited syndrome. This study
   was performed to find how often and how accurately a family history of
   colorectal cancer was recorded in the charts of patients on a colorectal
   surgical ward. A second aim was to see whether family history-taking
   could be improved. METHODS: The charts of 100 inpatients on a colorectal
   surgical floor were reviewed for the presence of a family history of
   colorectal cancer. Any chart documentation was compared with a family
   history obtained by a detailed interview. The chart review was repeated
   four years later. RESULTS: In the initial review, we found that a family
   history was recorded in 45 of 100 charts. It was accurate for colorectal
   cancer in 36 charts. Four years later, the rate of family history
   recording increased to 61 of 96, whereas the accuracy rare (45/61) did
   not change. Responses to a simple screening question asking about a
   family history of colorectal cancer were accurate in 77 percent of
   patients. CONCLUSIONS: Not all colorectal surgical patients have their
   family histories recorded, and even when it is recorded, it is not
   always correct. Despite improvement during a four-year period, there is
   still room for further improvement in the recording of a family history
   of colorectal cancer. Physicians should make an effort to ask this
   question and document the response in the hospital chart.}},

Abstract = {{Forty years ago, after the establishment of coronary care units, a
   significant decrease in mortality of acute myocardial infarction was
   noted. Twenty years ago, the breakthrough of thrombolysis realized once
   again a significant decrease in mortality. In this study we compare, in
   a rather small community hospital, the mortality and safety of
   thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction with a more
   conventional, conservative medical therapy.
   We examined all cases of acute myocardial infarction between 1978 up to
   1998 inclusive, concerning treatment and mortality rate after a six
   month period. To be included in the study, acute myocardial infarction
   had to fulfill particular inclusion criteria. A total of 1863 cases of
   acute myocardial infarction were included.
   The mortality rate of patients with acute myocardial infarction treated
   with thrombolytic agents was strikingly lower and statistically very
   significantly different (p < 0.001) in comparison with the mortality
   rate of patients treated with heparin or coumarine derivatives.
   The mortality rate dropped from 10.57\% in the coumarine group and from
   14.95\% in the heparin group to 5.41\% in the alteplase group, to 4.95\%
   in the anistreplase group and 4.00\% in the streptokinase subgroup.
   The complications directly connected to the treatment did not seem to be
   different between the five groups, and they were also not more frequent
   by using thrombolytic agents.
   In the last 20 years, better preventive measures (life habits, diet,
   medication) and trials to better control the risk factors have not
   influenced greatly the average amount of cholesterol in patients with an
   acute myocardial infarction, Also the percentage of patients with high
   blood pressure has hardly decreased over the last 20 years.
   The mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction has decreased
   significantly with the use of thrombolytics. In most cases,
   thrombolytics are administered routinely and safely. In this way, they
   are the first choice therapy for myocardial infarction in smaller
   hospitals.
   To obtain excellent coronary patency, thrombolytic agents with a long
   half-life and with PAI-1 resistance are required in the future.
   The current measures and medical therapies seem to be insufficient to
   control the risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{CCD observations obtained by the OGLE team for 128 RR Lyrae variables in
   omega Centauri have been analyzed. The period-luminosity and
   period-amplitude plots indicate that, in addition to fundamental (RRab)
   and first overtone (RRc) pulsators, the omega Centauri RR Lyrae
   population seems to include second overtone (RRe) and possibly
   third-overtone pulsators. The mean period for the 59 RRab stars is
   0(d).649, for the 48 RRc stars, it is 0(d).383, and for the 21 RRe
   stars, it is 0(d).304. The mean periods derived for the RRab and RRc
   stars are typical values for an Oosterhoff type II (OoII) cluster.
   Nevertheless, the period-amplitude plot also shows that some of the RR
   Lyrae variables have ``Oosterhoff type I{''} (OoI) characteristics. Most
   of the second-overtone variables exhibit nonradial pulsations similar to
   those recently detected in some of the RR Lyrae variables in the
   clusters M55 and M5, in the Galactic bulge, and in the LMC. Relative
   luminosities derived for the RRc variables from Fourier coefficients
   correlate with the observed apparent magnitudes. Masses for the RRe
   stars have been calculated from Fourier coefficients. A comparison of
   the derived masses for RRc stars in the four OoII dusters omega Cen,
   M15, M55, and M68 indicates that the masses of the RRc stars in M15 and
   M68 are almost 0.2 M., greater than those in the other two. Since M15
   and M68 have a high frequency of RRd stars among their first-overtone
   pulsators, while none have been identified in omega Cen or M55, this
   suggests that the double-mode pulsation phenomenon may be associated
   with mass. Among the RRc variables in omega Cen, the OoII variables have
   lower derived masses and higher luminosities than the OoI variables. An
   application of the period-density law to pairs of OoI and OoII RRab
   stars selected according to their position in the period-amplitude plot
   also indicates that the OoII variables in general have lower masses and
   higher luminosities. These findings support the hypothesis that the RR
   Lyrae variables in OoII systems are evolved horizontal-branch stars that
   spend their zero-age horizontal-branch phase on the blue side of the
   instability strip.}},

   is designed to evaluate the agreement between responses of a specific

   composed of items rarely endorsed by patients and normals. Finally, an
   inconsistency scale is derived from pairs of items highly correlated and
   usually answered in a similar or opposite way. Concomitant validity of
   the three scales is established by mean of correlations with similar
   MMPI-2 scales. By excluding yes-sayers with incongruent responses and
   protocols with many infrequent or inconsistent responses, the assessment

Abstract = {{Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with a range of adverse
   physical health outcomes, including chronic and infectious diseases. An
   emerging literature suggests that partner violence and specifically
   sexual violence may be associated with an increased risk of cervical
   neoplasia. To assess the risk of preinvasive and invasive cervical
   cancer in a cross-sectional study of women screened for IPV by type,
   frequency and duration, 1152 women ages 18-65 were recruited from family
   practice clinics in 1997-1998. They were screened for IPV during a brief
   in-clinic interview, and health history and current status were assessed
   in a follow-up interview. Of 1152 women surveyed, 14 (1.2\%) reported
   cervical cancer, and 20.3\% (n = 234) reported treatment for cervical
   neoplasia. Ever experiencing IPV was associated with an increased risk
   of invasive cervical cancer (adjusted relative risk {[}aRR] = 4.28; 95\%
   CI 1.94, 18.39) and with preinvasive cervical neoplasia (aRR = 1.47;
   95\% CI 1.16, 1.82). This association was stronger for women
   experiencing physical or sexual IPV than for women experiencing
   psychological IPV. Women with cervical cancer reported being in violent
   relationships longer and experiencing more frequent physical and sexual
   assaults and more IPV-associated injuries than did controls. This
   exploratory study suggests that IPV may increase a woman's risk of
   cervical neoplasia. The mechanism by which IPV effects cervical
   neoplasia may be indirect through psychosocial stress or negative coping
   behaviors or direct through sexual assaults and transmission of human
   papillomavirus (HPV).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the role of hepatic arterial phase (HAP) spiral
   computed tomography (CT), as compared with iodized oil (Lipiodol
   ultrafluid {[}LUF]) CT for revealing nodular hepatocellular carcinomas
   (HCC).
   Methods: Twenty-four cirrhotic patients underwent two-phase HCT
   examination: HAP 25 seconds and portal phase 70 seconds after injection
   of 1.5 mL/Kg contrast medium. All patients also underwent hepatic
   angiography and intraarterial infusion of iodized oil; LUF CT was
   performed 3-4 weeks after infusion. HCT images were compared with LUF CT
   images for detection of hepatic nodules.
   Results: We found no significant difference between the sensitivity of
   HAP CT and LUF CT for nodules >10 mm, while HAP CT was more sensitive
   than LUF CT in revealing nodules <10 mm (47 vs. 27, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: HCT should be considered as the first method for the
   detection of HCC, whereas LUF CT should be used only for therapy.}},

Title = {{The retrosigmoid approach for auditory brainstem implantation}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{826+}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To describe our experience with the retrosigmoid-transmeatal
   (RS-TM) approach in auditory brainstem implantation (ABI) as well as the
   anatomosurgical guidelines for this route.
   Study Design: Retrospective case review.
   Setting: Ear, Nose, and Throat Department of the University of Verona.
   Patients: Five patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) were
   operated on for vestibular schwannoma removal with ABI implantation from
   April 1997 to June 1999. The patients were four men and one woman, whose
   ages ranged from 22 to 37 years. The tumor sizes ranged from 12 to 30
   mm. The records of a total of 179 patients operated on for vestibular
   schwannoma (VS) removal via the RS-TM approach from January 1990 to June
   1999 were also evaluated. Their ages ranged from 18 to 88 years (average
   54 years). The tumor sizes ranged from 4 to 50 mm. Five patients had a
   solitary VS in the only hearing ear.
   Intervention: The classic RS-TM approach was used in all patients. After
   tumor excision, for ABI implantation, the landmarks (seventh, eighth,
   and ninth cranial nerves, choroid plexus) for the foramen of Luschka
   were carefully identified. The choroid plexus was then partially
   removed, and the tela choroidea was divided and bent back. The floor of
   the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle and the convolution of the
   dorsal cochlear nucleus became visible. The electrode array was then
   inserted into the lateral recess and correctly positioned with the aid
   of electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs).
   Main Outcome Measures: Intraoperative EABR and postoperative speech
   perception evaluation.
   Results: Auditory sensations were induced in all patients with various
   numbers of electrodes. Different pitch sensations could be identified
   with different electrode stimulation.
   Conclusions: In the authors' experience, the RS-TM approach is the route
   of choice for patients who are candidates for ABI when there is a chance
   of hearing preservation during surgery. If auditory function is lost
   during surgery, anatomical preservation of the cochlear nerve may allow
   hearing restoration with a cochlear implant. Direct intraoperative
   recording of cochlear nerve action potentials (CNAPs) and round window
   electrical stimulation are mandatory for these purposes. in addition,
   decompression of the intrameatal portion of the vestibular schwannoma
   and planned partial tumor resection with hearing preservation are also
   possible with the RS-TM approach.}},

   consecutive patients were included in the study. Twenty-seven patients
   were grafted, seven in first complete remission (CR) and 20 in first
   partial remission (PR), Preparative therapy consisted of
   cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) in all the patients.
   With a median follow-up of 6 years, the actuarial overall survival is
   64\% and the actuarial event-free survival is 55\%, Two
   treatment-related early deaths were observed. Eleven patients were
   informative for serial PCR analysis of minimal residual disease after
   ABMT: two relapsed, four remained disease-free with PCR positivity and
   five were disease-free with PCR negativity. These encouraging results
   lay the basis of future prospective randomized trials comparing

Abstract = {{In order to maximize performance and device utilization, the recent
   generation of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) take advantage of
   speed and density benefits resulting from heterogeneous FPGAs, which can
   be classified into heterogeneous FPGAs without bounded resources or
   heterogeneous FPGAs with bounded resources. In this paper, we study the
   technology mapping problem for heterogeneous FPGAs with or without
   bounded resources under the objective of delay optimization. We present
   the first polynomial-time delay optimal technology mapping algorithm,
   named HeteroMap, for heterogeneous FPGAs without bounded resources.
   Taking different delays of heterogeneous lookup tables (LUTs) into
   consideration, the HeteroMap algorithm computes the minimum mapping
   delay of a circuit based on a series of minimum-height K-feasible cut
   computations at each node in the circuit. We then study the technology
   mapping problem for delay minimization for heterogeneous FPGAs with
   bounded resources. We show that this problem is NP-hard for general
   networks, in contrast to the delay minimization mapping problem for
   heterogeneous FPGAs without bounded resources, but can be solved
   optimally in pseudopolynomial time for trees. We then present two
   heuristic algorithms to solve this problem for general networks, We have
   successfully applied these algorithms on MCNC benchmarks on commercial
   FPGAs. Encouraging results on delay and area reduction are reported.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Postimplant dosimetry of permanent prostate implants shows a
   loss of coverage compared to the preplan,One contributing factor is
   needle misplacement. The significance of needle misplacement and the
   clinical utility of dosimetric feedback mere analyzed in the setting of
   interventional magnetic resonance (IMR) guided prostate brachytherapy.
   Methods and Materials: Information provided by an intraoperative
   planning system was analyzed for 10 patients. Needle misplacement was
   measured and the dosimetric consequences calculated. Additional
   catheters and sources were placed following the insertion of all planned
   catheters to compensate for nonideal needle placement.
   Results: Source misplacement ranged from 0.0 to 1.0 cm (median, 0.3 cm).
   The resulting loss of coverage ranged from 1\% to 13\%, and the
   intraoperative dosimetric feedback allowed a recovery of from 0\% to
   12\% coverage. Between 0 and 3 (median, 2) additional needles and from 0
   to 10 (median, 8) additional sources were required to restore coverage
   of the target, Final planned coverage exceeded 94\% for all patients.
   Conclusion: The discrepancy between planned and achieved needle
   placement leads to a loss of dosimetric coverage of the target volume.
   Dosimetric feedback allows compensation for needle divergence. The
   technique of real-time dosimetric feedback does not require an IR-IR
   system, and could be generalized to ultrasound-guided implants, (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We discuss the general structure of the non-abelian Born-Infeld action,
   together with all of the alpha' derivative corrections, in flat
   D-dimensional space-time. More specifically, we show how the connection
   between open strings propagating in background magnetic fields and gauge
   theories on non-commutative spaces can be used to constrain the form of
   the effective action for the massless modes of open strings at weak
   coupling. In particular, we exploit the invariance in form of the
   effective action under a change of non-commutativity scale of space-time
   to derive algebraic equations relating the various terms in the alpha'
   expansion. Moreover, we explicitly solve these equations in the simple
   case D = 2, and we show, in particular, how to construct the minimal
   invariant derivative extension of the NBI action.}},

Abstract = {{We present and discuss long slit echelle spectra taken at various
   position angles in the nebula surrounding the symbiotic Mira RX Pup. The
   spectra were taken in the H alpha spectral region and are spatially
   resolved. The fact that the nebula shows up only in the {[}NII] lines
   has enabled us to subtract the underlying point source spectrum, showing
   clearly the spatio-kinematic structure of the nebula.
   We confirm the presence of the elongated feature found by Paresce (1990)
   at PA=15 degrees, but not its high H alpha/{[}NII] ratio. We also find
   no evidence for a jet, but a velocity decreasing with distance from the
   central object.
   A new nebular structure is found at similar to 90 degrees to the main
   feature. The split lines indicate a nebula expanding with velocities
   greater than or equal to 80 km s(-1), probably with a bipolar shape.
   Both nebulae are some 100s of times larger than the binary separation of
   RX Pup.}},

Abstract = {{The Loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta is a species sensitive to
   environmental changes caused by human activity. Stranded specimens found
   along the Adriatic, Baltic and Northern coasts seem to indicate that
   their diet, reproduction habits and aerials are the most affected
   ecological aspects of these organisms. We sampled liver, muscle and fat
   in C. caretta to detect the presence of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs)
   including congeners with meta and par a chlorine substitutions
   (dioxin;like planar configuration). The specimens analysed in this study
   come from the Adriatic Sea and were provided by the Fondazione Cetacea,
   member of the `Progetto Tartarughe'. Results have revealed average Sigma
   PCB concentrations of 119 ng/g w.w. in liver, 15 ng/g w.w. in muscle and
   334 ng/g w.w. in fat. Differences were found among concentrations of
   single congeners and of each class of isomers, which were detected as
   well. Coplanar PCB distribution was consistent with Sigma PCBs, as
   contamination levels mere higher in fat with respect to Liver and
   muscle. Such finding suggests not only that metabolic activity takes
   place in the liver, but that these contaminants bioaccumulate
   differently in the different tissues. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Few studies of inbreeding depression have focused on species producing
   both showy, chasmogamous (CH) flowers and self-pollinated, cleistogamous
   (CL) flowers. The goals of this investigation were to measure the level
   of inbreeding depression in the North American violet, Viola canadensis
   L., and to determine if any fitness differences were linked to floral
   type (CH versus CL) rather than to cross type (self versus outcross).
   Hand pollinations were carried out to produce self- and
   outcross-pollinated CH progeny, and CL seeds were also collected. In a
   greenhouse, selfed and outcrossed CH flowers produced similar numbers of
   seeds, and both types of progeny had similar survival rates and
   comparable numbers of CH flowers, although outcrossed CH progeny had
   14\% greater vegetative biomass than selfed CH progeny. The level of
   inbreeding depression in V. canadensis was low, indicating that there
   may be few drawbacks to selfing in this species. A comparison of CL and
   self-pollinated CH progeny showed that, although there were differences
   in CH flower number, overall fitness differences were minimal. The
   similar performance of selfed (CL and CH) and outcrossed progeny in
   early life-history stages of V. canadensis suggests a history of
   inbreeding in the population.}},

Abstract = {{Business executives outside of Japan have complained for decades that
   Japan's distribution system is essentially closed and does not permit
   easy access. The Japanese government and Japanese business executives,
   in turn, highlight the continuous introduction of distribution opening
   measures in their efforts to appease foreign critics. Globalization has
   made major inroads in distribution activities of firms, and the burst of
   Japan's bubble economy and the subsequent Asian crisis have brought
   major changes to the business environment. In follow-up to a 1991
   meeting, in 1998 we reconvened the lending distribution thinkers and
   doers in the policy, business, and research communities from 12
   countries. In this meeting, 70 participants with a high level of
   distribution expertise, held, for three days, discussions that focused
   on the complexity of distribution and trade practices, on impending
   changes and on future opportunities. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All

Abstract = {{We analyzed dispersion of intermediate and long period surface waves,
   recorded at permanent observatories in the Antarctic region, in a
   tomographic study based on group velocity. We considered Rayleigh waves
   from available records of all events which occurred during years
   1991-1995, with latitude lower than 40 degreesS and magnitude M greater
   than or equal to 5.0. We performed classic single-station dispersion
   analysis on the surface wave train to measure group velocity of the
   Rayleigh fundamental mode in the period range between 30 and 120 s. We
   iteratively applied two different techniques of filter analysis: a
   multiple-filter {[}Dziewanski et al., 1969] and a phase-matched filter
   algorithm {[}Herrin, and Goforth, 1977]. We used such dispersion
   measurements to compute two-dimensional maps of velocity anomalies in
   the region. We parameterized group velocity with linear splines, and
   inverted the linear system by means of singular value decomposition.
   Results are in significant agreement with earlier studies, but reach a
   considerably higher detail. Our model differentiates well among
   geologically different regions, such as the old East Antarctica craton,
   the accreted terranes of West Antarctica, and the oceanic lithosphere
   surrounded by the ring of mid-ocean ridges. We image slow areas
   corresponding to hot-spot regions, including a broad anomaly
   corresponding to recent volcanism in the Ross Sea, where the existence
   of a mantle plume has been proposed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Improved methods are needed to intensively measure ionic solutes in
   soils. The concentration C-i of ionic solutes in soils is directly
   proportional to soil solution electrical conductivity sigma (w). Time
   domain reflectometry (TDR) measures both soil water content theta and
   bulk soil electrical conductivity a, using the same probes. However,
   physical/conceptual models are required along with TDR measurements in
   order to use TDR for in situ estimates of C-i. We discuss a modeling
   approach {[}Mualem and Friedman, 1991] based on assumed analogy between
   tortuosity of electrical and hydraulic flow paths in variably saturated
   soils. We review the model approach, then derive a general expression
   for a pore geometry factor F-G considering flow of electrical current
   through randomly distributed capillary soil pores. Two F-G are derived
   based on two conceptual considerations of tortuous capillary length.
   Four water retention models (WRM) are used to describe soil hydraulic
   properties in the F-G. When fitted to the same measured water retention
   data, the four WRMs provided substantially different magnitudes for F-G.
   The model was then compared in terms of sigma (w) estimates using the
   two new F-G in combination with field-measured theta and sigma (a). One
   of the new F-G produced smaller estimated sigma (w) than did that
   proposed in the original, model. This is desirable based on our own and
   several other published comparisons that indicated the original model
   may overestimate sigma (w) in comparison with independent measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Our laboratory is investigating the effects of chronic stress on
   physiological, endocrine and behavioral measures, in order to elucidate
   the neuronal substrates for the pathophysiological consequences of
   stress in humans. In these studies, we have employed a rodent model of
   sustained stress in which rats are exposed to around-the-clock
   intermittent footshock that can be avoided or escaped by rats in the
   controllable stress group, but not by rats in the uncontrollable stress
   group. Each rat in the uncontrollable stress group is paired (yoked) to
   a rat in the controllable stress group such that the controllable stress
   group rat avoids or escapes shock for both rats. A third group of rats
   receives no shock (controls). We have previously reported that in male
   rats, plasma prolactin levels were elevated after 3 days of stress in
   both stress groups. In the present experiments we determined whether the
   increases in plasma prolactin were correlated with increases in anterior
   pituitary prolactin mRNA. In addition, we measured hormones and mRNA at
   three time points and we examined these responses in female as well as
   male rats. Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to
   chronic stress for 1, 3 or 14 days. In unstressed control rats, levels
   of anterior pituitary prolactin mRNA were fivefold higher in female as
   compared to male rats. However stress increased levels of anterior
   pituitary prolactin mRNA over baseline in both genders. After 1 day of
   stress, anterior pituitary prolactin mRNA levels increased in male and
   female rats belonging to both stress groups, with no significant
   difference seen between the uncontrollable vs. controllable stress
   groups. After 3 days of stress, anterior pituitary prolactin mRNA levels
   were even more elevated, and rats in the uncontrollable stress group had
   higher anterior pituitary prolactin mRNA levels than those in the
   controllable stress group. After 14 days of stress, there were no
   significant differences in control and stressed groups with respect to
   anterior pituitary prolactin mRNA. These data suggest that chronic
   sustained stress increases the synthesis of anterior pituitary prolactin
   mRNA during the first days of stress, and that levels return to
   prestress values sometime between 3 and 14 days of stress. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted June through August 1996 in an attempt to
   quantify short-term exposure levels to Coast Guard personnel performing
   routine inspection activities aboard commercial tank barges carrying
   gasoline. Transfer and fleeting operations were monitored in the ports
   of Pittsburgh, Pa., Huntington, W.Va., Baton Rouge, La., and Galveston,
   Tex. A total of 43 personal and 68 area samples were analyzed for
   benzene and total hydrocarbons as gasoline ({''}gasoline{''}). Results
   can be summarized as follows: Personal exposure to benzene gave 15-min
   time-weighted-average (TWA) results ranging from <0.10 to 0.50 ppm. Area
   benzene levels ranged from <0.04 to 170 ppm. Personal monitoring for
   gasoline revealed a range of <2.0 to 590 mg/m(3) with a GM of 23
   mg/m(3). Area sample results for gasoline ranged from 1.7 to 90,000
   mg/m(3). Twelve personal samples were collected for methyl-tert butyl
   ether (MTBE). Only two of these were above the limit of detection and
   had 15-min time-weighted averages of 22 ppm and 1.3 ppm. Eighteen MTBE
   area samples ranged in value from <3.0 to 38 ppm. Although none of the
   personal samples met or exceeded proposed or established short-term
   exposure standards, many of the area sampling results indicated that a
   significant risk of acute exposure exists in the vicinity of valves,
   pressure lines, and connections. This includes anticipated sources such
   as pressure vent valves as well as unexpected sources resulting from
   structural deficiencies onboard the vessels. These results further
   emphasize the value of safe work practices and proper vessel maintenance
   in controlling exposure to harmful chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents three studies concerned with the evaluation of moves
   in solutions to Tower of Hanoi problems and the effect that such
   evaluation processes have on solution success. The existing literature
   on problem solving suggests that verbalizing whilst solving a problem
   can have a positive effect upon performance. However, such verbalization
   has to be directed toward an explicit evaluation of particular moves.
   What remains unclear is whether evaluation without verbalization has the
   same effects or whether some characteristic of the process of
   verbalization gives rise to improved performance on such tasks. For
   example, the act of verbalizing per se may simply mean that more
   processing time is directed toward the problem-solving process. The
   studies reported in this paper suggest that the process of evaluation
   may be independent of verbalization processes and that non-verbal
   evaluation of moves (indicated by a key press) produces the same effects
   as a verbal evaluation of such moves. Moreover, the process of
   evaluating moves appears to produce a form of behaviour that is prone to
   disruption via the administration of secondary tasks, whereas
   non-evaluated solutions are not. This may suggest that problem solvers
   who engage in evaluation processes develop an explicit representation of
   the strategies used to solve the problem.}},

Abstract = {{The midge Chironomus tentans Fabricius is a commonly used freshwater
   invertebrate in sediment toxicity tests. Rigorous laboratory culturing
   techniques are needed to provide organisms of uniform quality and known
   age for use in testing and for the continuation of the culture itself.
   This study was conducted to determine the effect of initial culture
   stocking density on: (1) post-hatch (larval) dry weight, body length and
   head-capsule width at 10 and 20 days; (2) time to emergence; (3) number
   and sex of emergent adults; (4) number of larvae and pupae at test
   termination (day 42 post hatch); and (5) adult dry weight. Three egg
   stocking densities were used 690 (1.1 eggs cm(-)2), 1043 (1.7 eggs
   cm(-2)) and 1463 (2.4 eggs cm(-2)). Mean weight of larvae at 10 days in
   high density tanks (0.13 mg/organism) was significantly higher (P=0.003)
   than both the medium and low density tanks (0.10 and 0.09 mg/organism,
   respectively). No significant differences between the three stocking
   densities were observed for the body length or head-capsule width at
   either 10 or 20 days post-hatch. Although not statistically significant,
   larval dry weight decreased with increased stocking density at day 20. A
   significantly ( P=0.02) greater number of females (173 +/- 28) emerged
   from the low stocking density compared to both the medium and high
   stocking densities (123 +/- 45 and 118 +/- 54, respectively). Peak adult
   emergence for the low and medium stocking densities occurred between
   days 22 and 25 post-hatch, whereas peak adult emergence occurred between
   days 30 and 33 for the high stocking density. Survival relative to the
   initial number of eggs stocked was significantly greater (P=0.007) in
   the low density treatment compared to that in either the medium or the
   high density treatments. Mean adult weight exhibited an inverse
   relationship with initial stocking densities. At test end, there was not
   a significant difference in the mean number of organisms surviving and
   emerging in the three density levels. The central tendency for number of
   organisms surviving for all three treatments was 504 organisms per tank
   (0.82 organisms cm(-2)). The results of this experiment suggest that an
   optimal egg stocking density of 1.0 egg cm(-2) (similar to 600
   eggs/tank) be used with the feeding rate identified. This would ensure
   uniform larvae at the appropriate developmental stage (2nd-3rd instar)
   needed for toxicological research/testing (e.g. 10 days post-hatch), as
   well as producing sufficient emergence of males and females for future
   culture establishment.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new and simple method for constructing binary space
   partitions (BSPs) in arbitrary dimensions. We also introduce the concept
   of uncluttered scenes, which are scenes with a certain property that we
   suspect many realistic scenes exhibit, and we show that our method
   constructs a BSP of size O(n) for an uncluttered scene consisting of n
   objects. The construction time is O(n log n). Because any set of
   disjoint fat objects is uncluttered, our result implies an efficient
   method to construct a linear size BSP for fat objects.
   We use our BSP to develop a data structure for point location in
   uncluttered scenes. The query time of our structure is O(log n), and the
   amount of storage is O(n). This result can in turn be used to perform
   range queries with not-too-small ranges in scenes consisting of disjoint
   Eat objects or, more generally, in so-called low-density scenes.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this experiment was to validate an experimental set-up for
   studying locomotor pointing. The specific and also original element of
   this set-up was the interactive nature of virtual reality and movement
   production. This interaction was achieved through the coupling of a
   treadmill and a Silicon Graphics system. This latter system generated on
   a screen (3 x 2.3 m) an environmental array that moved according to the
   action produced by subjects on a treadmill. The task was to place either
   foot on a spatial target that appeared on the floor in front of the
   subject's displacement trajectory. We analyzed the step length patterns
   of subjects approaching these targets, along with the current
   target-subject relationship. The results are in agreement with a
   perception-action coupling type of control mechanism that operates
   continuously as the subject approaches the desired target. Apparently,
   these findings mirror observations of real-life locomotion, indicating
   that the present set-up provides a valid and useful tool for examining
   human locomotion.}},

Title = {{Factors influencing macroinvertebrate colonization of seasonal wetlands:
   responses to emergent plant cover}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{295-308}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. We conducted field experiments to examine factors influencing
   macroinvertebrate colonization of seasonally flooded marshes. Few
   macroinvertebrate species were found aestivating in soils within
   non-flooded wetlands indicating that most taxa colonize these marshes
   from other flooded habitats.
   2. We manipulated amounts of salt grass (Distichlis spicata) to examine
   how emergent plant cover affects aerial colonization by
   macroinvertebrates. Areas mowed 3 weeks before flooding had low plant
   cover, areas mowed 5 and 9 weeks before flooding had medium and high
   plant cover, respectively, and non-mowed control areas had the most
   plant cover. Macroinvertebrate numbers and biomass were generally higher
   in mowed treatment areas than in control areas, but overall diversity
   was generally higher in high plant cover and control areas than in low
   plant cover areas.
   3. Mosquitoes (Culicidae), brine flies (Ephydridae) and hover flies
   (Syrphidae) were positively correlated with amount of plant cover, and
   waterboatmen (Corixidae), midges (Chironomidae) and water scavenger
   beetles (Hydrophilidae) were negatively correlated with plant cover.
   Species assemblages changed seasonally among treatment areas because
   these taxa colonize wetlands at different times in the year.
   4. These results demonstrate that invertebrate communities may be
   different within plant stands with heterogeneous amounts of emergent
   cover, and management practices that alter the structure of wetland
   vegetation can influence macroinvertebrate communities colonizing
   seasonal marshes.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to compare the efficacy and potential protective
   or injurious effects of tidal liquid ventilation (TLV), liquid-assisted
   high-frequency oscillatory Ventilation (LA-HFOV), and high PEEP
   conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) in neonatal respiratory
   distress syndrome. Preterm lambs (124-126 days gestation),
   prophylactically treated with natural surfactant, were allocated to one
   of the treatment modalities or to an untreated fetal control group (F),
   euthanised after tracheal ligation. LA-HFOV animals received an
   intratracheal loading dose of 5 mL.kg(-1) followed by a continuous
   intrapulmonary instillation of 12 mL.kg(-1);h(-1) FC-75 perfluorocarbon
   liquid. The ventilation strategies aimed at keeping clinically
   appropriate arterial blood gases for a study period of 5 hours. A
   histological lung injury score was calculated and semiquantitative
   morphometry was performed on lung tissue fixed by Vascular perfusion.
   The alveolar-arterial pressure difference for O-2, was significantly
   lower throughout the study in TLV compared to CMV lambs; at 1, 2 and 5
   hours, oxygenation was better in TLV when compared to LA-HFOV. Total
   lung injury scores in TLV lambs were significantly lower than in either
   CMV or LA-HFOV animals, but higher when compared to F: CMV and LA-HFOV
   induced an excess of collapsed and overdistended alveoli, whereas in TLV
   alveolar expansion was normally distributed around predominantly normal
   alveoli. CMV and LA-HFOV; but not TLV; were associated with an excess of
   dilated airways.
   Thus, in the ovine neonatal RDS model, TLV compared favourably to either
   gas ventilation strategy by its more uniform ventilation, reduced lung
   injury, and improved gas exchange.}},

Abstract = {{CIMMYT (the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) has
   routinely conducted international wheat yield trials to study the
   adaptation of spring bread wheat. The first of these, the International
   Spring Wheat Yield Nursery (ISWYN). was conducted for 31 years from 1964
   to 1994 inclusive (30 cycles were conducted as no nursery was
   distributed in 1993 because of Karnal Bunt). Recently, pattern analysis
   methods have been developed and a set of computer programs written,
   which enable retrospective analyses of such historical databases to
   appraise the relationships among test environments in a way that
   discriminates among genotypes. Such an analysis was conducted on the 30
   years of yield data from ISWYN and the classification derived from these
   analyses was compared with an agroecological classification of spring
   wheat test environments derived by CIMMYT. The incidence of foliar
   diseases (stem rust, leaf rust, yellow rust, Septoria spa. and Fusarium
   spp.) was important in the distinction between the high-rainfall
   low-latitude (mega-environment 2) and the high-input-irrigated
   low-latitude (mega-environment 1) environment types. The accumulation of
   resistance genes for these diseases has been an objective of the CIMMYT
   wheat breeding program. It was hypothesized that, as the relevant
   resistance genes were successfully pyramided into the germplasm, the
   distinction between these two mega-environment types would disappear.
   The results of the retrospective analyses support this hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{One hundred years of timber harvest and reduced fire frequency have
   resulted in the conversion of once open stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) forests to dense forests dominated by Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Selection harvest and harvest with prescribed
   fire have been identified as possible tools to restore ponderosa pine
   stands to presettlement stand structures. Case studies were performed at
   three separate sites in western Montana to assess the influence of
   selection harvest and prescribed burning on soil N dynamics. These sites
   had been exposed to either selection harvest, selection harvest with
   prescribed burning, or a no-treatment control 0 (Lubrecht Experimental
   Forest), 2 (En Ranch), or 11 (Lick Creek Demonstration Site) years prior
   to initial soil analyses. Replicate soil samples were collected over at
   least two growing seasons at each site and analyzed for total C and N,
   potentially mineralizable N (PMN), short-term soil respiration rates,
   soil microbial biomass N, extractable NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-), and soluble
   sugars (measured as 0.5 M K(2)SO(4) extractable anthrone reactive carbon
   (KARC)). Selection harvest without prescribed burning had little or no
   influence on levels of available N or microbial activity relative to the
   control at all three sites. Selection harvest with prescribed fire,
   however, significantly increased extractable NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-) and KARC
   immediately following treatment. Such differences were not observed 2 or
   11 years following treatment. Potentially mineralizable N was
   significantly increased immediately following fire, but decreased to
   levels lower than the control 1 year following treatment. Levels of PMN
   were also found to be less than the control 2 and 11 years after
   treatment. Similarly, microbial biomass N was elevated immediately
   following prescribed burning, but was significantly lower than the
   control for up to 11 years following prescribed burning. Levels of
   mineralizable N were lowered within a year of treatment as a result of
   (1) N loss during soil heating, (2) N loss to plant uptake, and (3)
   potential leaching losses. The effect of reduced mineralizable N on
   long-term site productivity is not clear, however, these losses of N
   from the ecosystem should be considered along with stand mortality and
   yield when assessing the potential sustainability of forest management
   strategies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of producing bulk specimens by explosive compaction of a
   synthetic diamond powder without binders and catalytic additions is
   considered. The method of long-pulse explosive compaction with the use
   of multilayered explosive charges with a total mass up to 760 kg is used
   in experiments. The physicochemical properties of the resulting compacts
   are studied in detail. It is shown that, for relatively low loading
   pressures, long-pulse explosive compaction makes it possible to produce
   specimens whose hardness is equal to that usually obtained under higher
   (by one order of magnitude) shock pressures with a pulse duration of
   approximate to1 mu sec. In contrast to short-pulse loading, long-pulse
   loading ensures a considerable decrease in the cracking of the compacts.}},

Abstract = {{There is still disagreement about whether crop growth rate or soil
   nitrate concentration control nitrogen absorption by crops under field
   conditions. The influence of these factors on the control of N uptake
   rate was examined in the absence of water stress, using data on dry
   matter production, above-ground nitrogen accumulation and soil nitrate
   concentration from several N-fertilizer experiments on winter wheat,
   winter oilseed rape and maize. The results confirmed that crops can
   accumulate nitrogen far in excess of the `critical dilution curve',
   which defines the minimum amount of nitrogen needed for maximal growth
   rate: the N concentration in plants could exceed the critical N
   concentration by 70 to 80\% for the three species studied. The nitrate
   uptake rate index (NUI) was calculated as the ratio of actual and
   critical N uptake rates, at intervals of 1 week. NUI varied with nitrate
   concentration in the 0-30 cm soil layer according to a Michaelis-Menten
   equation (with one or two components). This response was compared with
   the kinetics of saturation of the nitrate uptake systems: the high
   affinity transport system (HATS) and the low affinity transport system
   (LATS). As a result, it is proposed that there is a critical N dilution
   curve delimiting two domains of N use by plants. This is linked to the
   two nitrate transport systems, with HATS working at low nitrate
   concentrations, below the critical dilution curve, and LATS at high
   nitrate concentrations, above the curve. NUI provides another method for
   calculating the actual nitrate uptake rate, which depends on the maximal
   crop growth rate (without N deficiency) and on the external nitrate
   concentration. (C) 2000 Annals of Botany Company.}},

Abstract = {{Pentaheptites (three-coordinate tilings of the plane by pentagons and
   heptagons only) are classified under the chemically motivated
   restriction that all pentagons occur in isolated pairs and all heptagons
   have three heptagonal neighbors. They span a continuum between the two
   lattices exemplified by the boron nets in ThMoB(4) (cmm) and YCrB(4)
   (pgg), in analogy with the crossover-from cubic-close-packed to
   hexagonal-close-packed; packings, in 3D. Symmetries realizable for these
   pentaheptite layers are three strip groups (periodic in one dimension),
   p1a1, p112; and pill, and five Fedorov groups (periodic in two
   dimensions), cmm, pgg, pg, p2, and p1. All can be constructed by
   simultaneous rotation of the central bonds of pyrene tilings of the
   graphite sheet. The unique lattice of cmm symmetry corresponds to the
   previously proposed pentaheptite carbon metal: Analogous
   pentagon-heptagon tilings on other surfaces including the torus, Klein
   bottle, and cylinder, face-regular tilings of pentagons and b-gons, and
   a full characterization of tilings involving isolated pairs and/or
   triples of pentagons are presented. The Kelvin paradigm of a continuum
   of structures arising-from propagation of two original motifs has many
   potential applications in 2D and 3D.}},

Abstract = {{Research pertaining to the consumption impulse is sparse in the
   literature. To address this lacuna, the author presents and validates a
   detailed theoretical framework explicating the consumption impulse
   formation process, and examining the role played by cognitive and
   volitional processes in its resistance or enactment. The model makes the
   distinction between consonant (harmonious) impulses and dissonant
   (conflicting) impulses and elaborates on the role of the impulsivity
   trait, situational variables, and constraining factors in enactment or
   resistance of the consumption impulse. The results of two studies
   provide support to the general working of this theoretical framework.
   This research has the potential to inform many critical issues
   surrounding consumer behavior, such as regulating consumption impulses
   in retail and on-line shopping environments, and developing
   interventions for prevention of harmful consumer behaviors such as

Abstract = {{Three cases of young women who developed severe vertebral osteoporosis
   after pregnancy and during lactation are described. These patients
   shared several features: a low-calcium diet during most of their lives,
   very-low body weight in two patients, and a positive family history of

   fractures, severely diminished bone mineral density of the spine (Z
   score = -3.3 to -4.1), and a less severely affected bone mineral density
   of the hip (Z score = -1.6 to -2.3). During the prolonged follow-up of
   these patients, treated with oral biphosphonates, vitamin D, and
   calcium, an improved clinical response with a marked recovery of spine
   bone mineral density was observed. Poor general nutrition, low calcium
   intake, and a positive family history of osteoporosis appear to be
   strong risk factors for pregnancy- and lactation-associated
   osteoporosis. Although the mechanism of action is uncertain, calcium,

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1611-1616}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is controversy regarding the precise mechanism by
   which epilepsy results after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Previous
   reports have suggested that mesial temporal lobe epilepsy may result
   from TBI only in young children, while neocortical epilepsy arises from
   TBI in later life. These conclusions were based on surgical series and
   may be biased because of patient selection.
   Objective: To determine the frequency of mesial temporal lobe as opposed
   to neocortical epilepsy in patients with intractable epilepsy resulting
   from TBI after the age of 10 years.
   Patients and Methods: We identified 23 patients with intractable
   epilepsy who had TBI after the age of 10 years, preceding the onset of
   epilepsy. Patients were studied by simultaneous videotape and scalp
   electroencephalographic recording of typical seizures; magnetic
   resonance imaging; neuropsychologic studies; and, when appropriate,
   intracarotid amobarbital testing. Two patients underwent anterior
   temporal lobectomies.
   Results: Of the 23 patients, 8 (35\%) had mesial temporal lobe epilepsy,
   based on the finding of hippocampal sclerosis on a magnetic resonance
   imaging scan, consistent interictal and ictal electroencephalographic
   recordings, evidence of temporal lobe dysfunction on neuropsychologic
   testing, and characteristic seizure semiology. Two of these patients
   underwent anterior temporal lobectomies with clinical benefit, and
   hippocampal sclerosis was confirmed pathologically. In 2 cases, patients
   were not treated surgically because of bilateral temporal lobe
   dysfunction noted on intracarotid amobarbital testing. Eleven patients
   had neocortical epilepsy; 1 had primary generalized epilepsy; and, in 3,
   the site of seizure onset was not localized.
   Conclusions: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy can result from TBI in
   adolescents and adults as well as in children, and can often be
   bilateral and associated with multifocal injury. This information may be
   useful in developing prophylactic therapy for posttraumatic epilepsy.}},

Abstract = {{Hot-carrier effects have been investigated in n-channel thin-film
   transistors fabricated on large grain polysilicon films. The bias-stress
   conditions for maximum device degradation have been determined by photon
   emission measurements. Under these bias-stress conditions, devices with
   identical transfer characteristics before stress, are either stable or
   exhibit strong degradation with reduced field effect mobility. We
   propose that the different degradation behavior is related with the
   quality of the grain boundaries and their position in the channel with
   respect to the drain junction. The results indicate that when a grain
   boundary is located closer to the drain region, it becomes more prone to
   degradation by the hot carriers generated in the high field region of
   the drain junction. Numerical simulations suggest that the device
   degradation is due to an increase of the grain boundary band tail
   states. In addition to this mechanism, the existence of a critical path
   for the current flow from source to drain has been proposed to explain
   the observed different degradation behavior of similar devices. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Morphologic examinations of salivary gland neoplasias arising in male
   BALB/c (H-2(d)) mice carrying the activated HER2/neu (BALB-NeuT)
   indicate that expression of the oncogene product in the ductal-acinar
   structures results in a very human-like acinic cell adenocarcinoma with
   a smoldering course and infrequent metastatization. Typical and then
   atypical hyperplasia of ducts and acini preceded the rise of salivary
   tumors that originated from the confluence of multiple ductal
   hyperplastic foci, while hyperplastic acini behaved as an abortive
   preneoplastic lesion. The vascular network in normal, hyperplastic and
   neoplastic salivary tissue was analysed to see whether activation of the
   angiogenic process is essential in salivary gland carcinogenesis.
   Immunostaining with anti-endothelial cells (anti-CD3 I), anti-beta(3)
   integrin and anti-laminin antibodies revealed that microvessel density
   was significantly higher in normal and hyperplastic than in neoplastic
   tissue, in which no signs of new vessel sprouting were found. Assessment
   of angiogenic factor expression indicates a low presence of VEGF in
   normal, hyperplastic and neoplastic epithelium, while bFGF was
   preferentially produced but not exported by neoplastic cells and
   remained in a cell-associated form. Our data suggest that normal
   salivary gland vascularization is able to support tumor onset and
   development with no need for an angiogenic switch. Int. J. Cancer

Abstract = {{Background: Despite its pivotal role in mucosal inflammation, data on
   TNF alpha levels in inflammatory bowel diseases have been contradictory.
   Aim: To examine TNF alpha production in relation to the type and
   severity of inflammation and therapy, using colonic explant cultures.
   Materials and methods: Rectal mucosal biopsies from 271 paediatric
   patients (178 inflammatory bowel disease, 27 inflammatory controls, 66
   normal) were cultured for 4 or 18 h. Basal TNF alpha tissue content and
   release into the medium were measured by ELISA and compared to
   histological severity and clinical parameters.
   Results: TNF alpha release as well as tissue-associated TNF alpha levels
   were significantly increased in rectal biopsies from involved
   inflammatory bowel disease tissue. The amount of TNF alpha correlated
   with inflammation severity scores. TNF alpha levels were higher at 18
   compared to 4 h in all groups, whether inflamed or not. TNF alpha
   released from rectal biopsies was lower among treated patients at 18 h.
   The presence of proximal colonic involvement was associated with higher
   TNF alpha release by uninvolved Crohn's disease rectal biopsies compared
   to patients with ileitis alone.
   Conclusions: TNF alpha production and release is increased in involved
   rectal explants from inflammatory bowel disease. Anti-inflammatory
   treatment diminishes this response.}},

   into redefinitions of the Standard model electroweak parameters. This
   demonstrates explicitely that the decoupling theorem works for the heavy
   heavy Higgs particles. This is also compared with the paradigmatic and
   different case of the Standard Model heavy Higgs particle. Finally, this
   work together with our two previous works, complete the demonstration
   that all the non-standard particles in the MSSM namely, squarks,

Abstract = {{In addition to its known effect on renal tubular transport, frusemide
   (furosemide) has been shown to affect renal circulation. This study in
   the anaesthetised rat examined the influence of frusemide (bolus 0.25 or
   0.5 mg kg(-1) I.V., then infusion delivering the same dose over 1 h) on
   renal cortical and medullary circulation measured as laser-Doppler blood
   (cell) flux. The responses were compared with simultaneously measured
   changes in renal excretion and in the tissue admittance, an index of
   medullary ionic hypertonicity of the interstitium. Renal vascular
   responses to frusemide were significant but not dose dependent. During
   low-dose frusemide infusion cortical flux decreased 11.5 +/- 0.9\% and
   medullary flux decreased 32.3 +/- 3.5\% (difference significant at P <
   0.001). During high-dose infusion the decreases were by 13.5 +/- 1.4 and
   29.3 +/- 3.8\%, respectively (difference significant at P < 0.001).
   Sodium excretion increased 15-fold (by 3.7 +/- 0.4 mu mol min(-1)) and
   30-fold (by 5.9 +/- 1.1 mu mol min(-1)) during low- and high-rate
   infusion of frusemide, respectively. By contrast, medullary tissue
   admittance decreased similarly with the two doses: maximally by 13.4 +/-
   1.4 and 10.9 +/- 0.9\%, respectively. The observations that an
   exaggerated post-frusemide decrease in blood flow within the medulla
   coincided with decreasing tissue admittance in this zone and that
   neither medullary blood now nor admittance changes were related to the
   dose suggest a causal relationship between interstitial ionic
   hypertonicity and vascular resistance. We propose that the
   post-frusemide decrease in medullary tissue NaCl depressed medullary
   circulation by inhibiting local generation of vasodilator
   prostaglandins.}},

Abstract = {{Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are used by cells for protein synthesis
   or are catabolized into sources for glucose and lipid production. These
   branched-chain amino acids influence proteolysis, hormone release, and
   cell cycle progression along with their other metabolic roles. The
   branched-chain amino acids play a central role in regulating cellular
   protein turnover by reducing autophagy. These essential amino acids are
   committed to their catabolic fate by the activity of the branched-chain
   alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Activity of the branched-chain
   alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex is regulated by
   phosphorylation/inactivation of the alpha-subunit performed by a complex
   specific kinase. Here we show that elimination of the branched-chain
   amino acids from the medium of cultured cells results in a two- to
   threefold increased production of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid
   dehydrogenase kinase with a decrease in the activity state of the
   branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. The mechanism cells
   use to increase kinase production under these conditions involves
   recruitment of the kinase mRNA into polyribosomes. Promoter activity and
   the steady-state concentration of the mRNA are unchanged by these

Abstract = {{Objectives. This study had three objectives: first, to investigate the

   amongst men; secondly, to study the associations of C-reactive protein
   levels with cardiovascular risk factors; and thirdly, to adjust the risk
   of myocardial infarction for such factors.
   Design and subjects. A case-control study including 560 patients with a
   first myocardial infarction who had survived at least 6 months, plus 646
   control subjects.
   Results. Patients had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein
   (mean 2.2 mg L-1) than control subjects (mean 1.7 mg L-1; P < 0.001).
   Persons in the highest quintile of C-reactive protein had an unadjusted
   1.9-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction compared with persons
   in the lowest quintile (odds ratio 1.9, 95\% CI: 1.3-2.7). C-reactive
   protein was, in addition to smoking, associated with several
   cardiovascular risk factors: age, obesity, diabetes, blood pressure,
   triglycerides and inversely associated to HDL cholesterol. Adjustment

   and triglycerides, substantially decreased the risk of myocardial
   infarction for persons in the highest quintile of C-reactive protein,
   compared to those in the fewest quintile, to 1.3 (95\% CI: 0.9-1.9).
   Conclusions. Our findings confirm previous reports that C-reactive
   protein predicts the risk of myocardial infarction. However, this
   association does not appear to be causal, since the increase in risk can
   to a large extent be explained by the presence of other cardiovascular
   risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{DNA ligases are enzymes required for the repair, replication and

   phosphodiester bonds at single-strand breaks in double-stranded DNA.
   Despite their occurrence in all organisms, DNA ligases show a wide
   diversity of amino acid sequences, molecular sizes and properties. The
   enzymes fall into two groups based on their cofactor specificity, those
   requiring NAD(+) for activity and those requiring ATP. The eukaryotic,
   viral and archael bacteria encoded enzymes all require ATP.
   NAD(+)-requiring DNA ligases have only been found in prokaryotic
   organisms. Recently, the crystal structures of a number of DNA ligases
   have been reported. It is the purpose of this review to summarise the

Abstract = {{Apolipoprotein E7 (apoE7) (apoE3 E244K/E245K) is a naturally occurring
   mutant in humans that is associated with increased plasma lipid levels
   and accelerated atherosclerosis, It is reported to display defective
   binding to low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, high affinity
   binding for heparin, and like apoE4, preferential association with very
   low density lipoproteins (VLDL), There are two potential explanations
   for the preference of apoE7 for VLDL: lysine mutations, which occur in
   the major lipid-binding region (residues 244-272) of the
   carboxy-terminal domain of apoE7, could either directly determine the
   lipoprotein-binding preference or could interact with negatively charged
   residues in the amino-terminal domain, resulting in a domain interaction
   similar to that in apoE4 (interaction of Arg-61 with Glu-255), which is
   responsible for the apoE4 VLDL preference. To distinguish between these
   possibilities, we determined the binding preferences of recombinant
   apoE7 and two amino-terminal domain mutants, apoE7 (E49Q/E50Q) and apoE7
   (D65N/E66Q), to VLDL-like emulsion particles, ApoE7 and both mutants
   displayed a higher preference for the emulsion particles than did apoE3,
   indicating that the carboxy-terminal lysine mutations in apoE7 are
   directly responsible for its preference for VLDL, Supporting this
   conclusion, the carboxy-terminal domain 12-kDa fragment of apoE7
   (residues 192-299) displayed a higher preference for VLDL emulsions than
   did the wild-type fragment, In addition, lipid-free apoE7 had a higher
   affinity for heparin than did apoE, However, when apoE7 was complexed
   with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine or VLDL emulsions, the affinity
   difference was eliminated. In contrast to previous studies, we found
   that apoE7 does not bind defectively to the LDL receptor, as determined
   in both cell culture and solid-phase assays. We conclude that the two
   additional lysine residues in the carboxy-terminal domain of apoE7
   directly alter its lipid- and heparin-binding affinities. These
   characteristics of apoE7 could contribute to its association with
   increased plasma lipid levels and atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of cortisol (F) to cortisone (E) is catalyzed by 11 beta
   -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. The present study was designed to
   investigate the changes of F and E plasma concentration as an indirect
   measurement of 11 beta -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in infancy
   and childhood. Plasma samples were obtained from 262 healthy children
   and adolescents aged 1 d to 18 y. Plasma F and E were measured, using
   specific radioimmunoassays after extraction and automated Sephadex LH 20
   chromatography. The F/E ratio was calculated to assess 11 beta
   -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity. During the first year of life,
   plasma F levels rose significantly (r(2) = 0,24; p = 0.01), and
   thereafter no further increase was seen until adulthood (r(2) = 0.01; p
   = 0.86). In contrast, plasma E significantly decreased during the first
   year of life (r(2) = -0.35; p < 0.001) and stayed unchanged thereafter
   (r(2) = 0.02; p = 0.81). As a consequence, the F/E ratio rose
   significantly during the first year (r(2) = 0.67; p < 0.001) but did not
   change afterward (r(2) = 0.001; p = 0.99). During the first year of
   Life, there is a change from the predominance of E, with low
   mineralocorticoid receptor affinity, to F, with high mineralocorticoid
   receptor affinity. This shift corresponds to the declining plasma
   concentrations of aldosterone during infancy. The changes may indicate a
   not yet recognized, significant change of 11 beta -hydroxysteroid
   dehydrogenase isoenzyme activity or alterations in the secretion of F
   and E, which may be of relevance for the development of arterial blood
   pressure in infancy.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the relation between the distribution of capital
   to real estate investors and a market-based measure of information
   asymmetry. Previous research suggests that information asymmetries
   decrease as capital is distributed to outside investors. However, little
   attention has been given to those firms for which the marginal benefit
   of increased distributions may be small. Our analyses are based on a
   sample of real estate investment trusts (REITs), which are popularly
   characterized as high yield investments due to the regulation of a
   minimum distribution policy. The extent to which information asymmetry
   is influenced by these regulations, as well as by the opaque nature of
   the underlying assets, is an interesting empirical question. The results
   based on several years of data indicate that the perception of
   asymmetric information is lower for REITs that distribute more capital
   to their shareholders. A decomposition of yield into income and
   return-of-capital components reveals no differential effect in
   information relevance. The insights drawn from the results may be useful
   in determining the efficacy of real estate capital distribution policies
   and regulations.}},

   that were seen at our center in the period 1989-1999.
   METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients with the
   diagnosis of AIH in our institution during the period 1989-1999, and
   found that five patients had type 2 AIH. All patients were female; four
   of five were young, and four of five presented with overt cirrhosis.
   RESULTS: One patient died, one underwent liver transplantation and two
   are currently awaiting liver transplantation. Response to conventional
   immunosuppressive therapy was poor and two patients required treatment
   with cyclosporine and tacrolimus respectively. Four of five patients had
   at least one associated autoimmune disorder, including IgE-induced IgA
   deficiency, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and arthritis.
   HLA class II DR4 was present in two patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: LKM-positive autoimmune hepatitis seems to be a Subset of
   autoimmune hepatitis with distinct clinical features; although rare, it
   is occasionally encountered in the western United States. Prompt
   diagnosis and appropriate immunosuppressive treatment are recommended,
   as well as early referral to transplantation centers. Clinicians should
   be aware of this condition in the setting of young female patients with
   unexplained severe liver disease. (C) 2000 by Am. Cell. of

Abstract = {{In the setting of ``affine{''} jump-diffusion state processes, this
   paper provides an analytical treatment of a class of transforms,
   including various Laplace and Fourier transforms as special cases, that
   allow an analytical treatment of a range of valuation and econometric
   problems. Example applications include fixed-income pricing models, with
   a role for intensity-based models of default, as well as a wide range of
   option-pricing applications. An illustrative example examines the
   implications of stochastic volatility and jumps for option valuation.
   This example highlights the impact on option `smirks' of the joint
   distribution of jumps in volatility and jumps in the underlying asset
   price, through both jump amplitude as well as jump timing.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of functional gap junctions between haematopoietic
   progenitor cells (HPCs) and stromal cells of the haematopoietic
   microenvironment in the human system is a controversial issue. Primary
   CD34(+) HPCs isolated from leukapheresis products were co-incubated with
   the human fibroblastoid bone marrow stromal cell line L87/4 in
   short-term liquid culture. Using the highly sensitive double whole-cell
   patch-clamp technique, we found that the majority (91\%) of CD34(+) HPCs
   are electrically coupled to L87/4 cells. Importantly, efficient coupling
   was observed within 1 h of the attachment of CD34(+) HPCs to plastic
   adherent L87/4 cells. By comparison, homologous cell pairs formed by
   L87/4 cells exhibited a significantly higher electric coupling. Analysis
   of single-channel conductances revealed an electric profile
   characteristic of connexin 43 (Cx43)-type gap junctions for both
   homologous and heterologous cell pairs. The Cx phenotype was confirmed
   using Cx43-specific monoclonal antibodies in a flow cytometric assay and
   reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the
   detection of Cx43 mRNA. Finally, the electrophysiological studies were
   complemented by dye-transfer experiments using the recently described
   `parachute' technique that allows the monitoring of dye diffusion
   without disruption of the plasma membrane. Taken together, our data
   indicate that functional Cx43-type gap junctions exist between stromal
   cells and immature HPCs and, thus, may provide an important regulatory
   pathway in haematopoiesis.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of non-vanishing masses and mixings among neutrino
   flavors on the detection of neutrinos from stellar collapse by a water
   Cherenkov detector. We consider a framework in which there are four
   neutrino flavors, including a sterile neutrino, whose mass squared
   differences and mixings are constrained by the present understanding of
   solar, atmospheric and laboratory neutrino detection. We also include
   the effects of high density matter within the supernova core. Unlike in
   the three flavor scenario, we find that the number of events due to the
   dominant process involving electron-antineutrinos changes dramatically
   for some allowed mixing parameters. Furthermore, contributions from
   charged-current scattering off oxygen nuclei in the detector can be
   considerably enhanced due to flavor mixing. We also present a comparison
   between the two possible scenarios, namely, when only three active
   neutrino flavors are present and when they are accompanied by a fourth
   sterile neutrino.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To investigate the effects of grapefruit juice on absolute
   bioavailability of scopolamine in healthy subjects and to evaluate
   differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between genders.
   Subjects, material and methods: 14 healthy subjects (7 men and 7 women)
   received scopolamine 0.5 mg as intravenous;infusion, and as oral
   ingestion with and without grapefruit juice on separate occasions. Serum
   and urine samples were analyzed using gaschromatography-ion trap tandem
   mass spectrometry. Changes in subjective state were determined up to 24
   hours after drug administration. Results: After oral administration,
   pretreatment with grapefruit juice led to a 30\% increase in systemic
   bioavailability of scopolamine (p = 0.005) and a significant increase in
   time to reach peak serum concentration (t(max)) of scopolamine (p <
   0.001). The C-max value (6.61 +/- 0.63 ng/ml) of scopolamine after i.v.
   administration in male subjects was significant higher compared with the
   value in female subjects (3.93 +/- 0.04 ng/ml; geometric mean +/- SEM; p
   = 0.007). No differences were found in urinary excretion rate of
   scopolamine and scopolamine glucuronide across genders and between the
   three different routes of scopolamine administration. Scopolamine
   produced time-dependent decrements in subjective alertness while
   contentment and calmness were not influenced. Conclusions: Pretreatment
   with grapefruit juice delayed the absorption and increased the
   bioavailability of scopolamine, whereas elimination was not
   significantly affected. This study identified an influence of gender on
   C-max of scopolamine after i.v. infusion.}},

   the supercooled liquid region. This mainly results from a stronger
   composition dependence of the glass transition than the crystallization
   temperature. The results are discussed with respect to the kinetics and
   thermodynamics of the supercooled liquid suggesting that changes in the
   atomic arrangement and in the free volume are the microscopic origin for
   the differences in the viscosity and the thermal stability of the
   alloys. All investigated alloys are rather strong glasses as expressed
   by a relatively high melt viscosity, a low Vogel-Fulcher Tammann (VFT)
   temperature and a rather high fragility parameter, but in general
   (Zr0.55Al0.10Cu0.30Ni0.05)(100-x)Fe-x alloys are slightly stronger
   glasses than (Zr0.650Al0.075CU0.175Ni0.100)(100-x)Fe-x alloys.}},

Abstract = {{We and others have previously shown that nematodes or nematode products
   can stimulate or inhibit the generation of lymphocyte responses,
   suggesting that nematodes exert diverse effects on the developing immune
   responses of their host. In this study we examined the immunomodulatory
   effect of a soluble extract of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (adult worm
   homogenate {[}AWH]) on B-cell responsiveness. We found that the extract
   inhibited the proliferation of B cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
   stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was specific to B
   cells, since the extract did not inhibit T-cell proliferation to
   concanavalin A or anti-CD3 stimulation. The data presented here confirm
   that the extract is not toxic to B cells. We present evidence that the
   active factor is proteinaceous in nature and that the inhibitory
   activity is restricted to the adult stage of Nb, The extract does not
   appear to interfere with early activation events since it can be added
   up to 48 h after LPS stimulation, and it inhibited responses to phorbol
   myristate acetate and ionomycin. Furthermore, the proliferation of B
   cells to other activators was also inhibited by AWH, This observation
   shows that the inhibitory activity of AWH is not restricted to
   LPS-mediated B-cell proliferation. We present evidence that, in the
   absence of accessory cells, the inhibitory effect of the extract was
   ablated, This observation shows that the activity of AT VH is not
   mediated directly on B cells but is mediated via the production of
   negative signals from accessory cells (macrophages), which affect a
   downstream pathway required by all B-cell activators tested. These
   effects on B-cell and accessory cell function are likely to have a
   significant effect on the outcome of infections experienced
   concurrently.}},

Abstract = {{Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a pleiotropic cytokine that elicits both
   proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune responses. Recent studies
   underscore its role in several diseases, including asthma and cancer.
   Solution studies of IL-13 and its soluble receptors may facilitate the
   design of antagonists/agonists which would require milligram quantities
   of specifically labeled protein. A synthetic gene encoding human IL-13
   (hIL-13) was inserted into the pMAL-c2 vector with a cleavage site for
   the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. Coexpression of the fusion
   protein and TEV protease led to in vivo cleavage, resulting in high
   levels of hIL-13 production. hIL-13, localized to inclusion bodies, was
   purified and refolded to yield approximately 2 mg per liter of bacteria
   grown in minimal media. Subsequent biochemical and biophysical analysis
   of both the unlabeled and N-15-labeled protein revealed a bioactive
   helical monomer. In addition, the two disulfide bonds were unambiguously
   demonstrated to be Cys29-Cys57 and Cys45-Cys71 by a combined proteolytic
   digestion and mass spectrometric analysis. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Because the definitions of reproductive health and reproductive rights
   are so broad, it has been possible in Egypt and elsewhere for one or

   detriment or exclusion of others, and a comprehensive approach avoided.
   Reproductive health and rights language was introduced in Egypt around
   the time of the International Conference on Population and Development
   in Cairo in 1994. From the moment these concepts were translated into
   Arabic, activists, scholars and women themselves discussed and debated
   their meanings and questioned whether Egyptian culture permitted a
   rights approach of this kind and whether reproductive rights were
   actually perceived as such by Egyptian women. This paper discusses the
   language of reproductive rights in relation to cultural specificity in
   the Egyptian context, Egyptian women's perceptions of reproductive
   rights, the role of tradition and religion, and the ways in which
   reproductive rights are taken up under Egyptian law It analyses some of
   the arguments used against reproductive rights on these grounds.}},

Abstract = {{Triangle strips are a widely used hardware-supported data-structure to
   compactly represent and efficiently render polygonal meshes. In this
   paper we survey the efficient generation of triangle strips as well as
   their variants. We present efficient algorithms for partitioning
   polygonal meshes into triangle strips. Triangle strips have
   traditionally used a buffer size of two vertices, In this paper we also
   study the impact of larger buffer sizes and various queuing disciplines
   on the effectiveness of triangle strips. View-dependent simplification
   has emerged as a powerful tool for graphics acceleration in
   visualization of complex environments. However, in a view-dependent
   framework the triangle mesh connectivity changes at every frame making
   it difficult to use triangle strips. In this paper we present a novel
   data-structure, Skip Strip, that efficiently maintains triangle strips
   during such view-dependent changes. A Skip Strip stores the vertex
   hierarchy nodes in a skip-list-like manner with path compression. We
   anticipate that Skip Strips will provide a road-map to combine rendering
   acceleration techniques for static datasets, typical of retained-mode
   graphics applications, with those for dynamic datasets found in
   immediate-mode applications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background, Technetium-99m tetrofosmin single photon emission computed
   tomography (SPECT) imaging is increasingly used in conjunction with
   exercise and vasodilator stress test as a means of evaluating coronary
   artery disease (CAD), Dobutamine stress test is an alternative in
   patients with limited exercise capacity, This study assessed the
   accuracy of dobutamine-atropine stress tetrofosmin SPECT as a means of
   diagnosing and localizing CAD.
   Methods and Results. We studied 124 patients (mean age, 57 +/- 12 years;
   88 men) with limited exercise capacity and suspected CAD with dobutamine
   (as much as 40 mug/kg/min)-atropine (as much as 1 mg) Tc-99m tetrofosmin
   SPECT, Resting images were acquired 24 hours after the stress test.
   Significant CAD was defined as 50\% or greater luminal diameter stenosis
   in 1 or more major coronary arteries. Myocardial perfusion abnormalities
   (fixed and/or reversible defects) were detected in 70 of gs patients
   with CAD and in 10 of the 36 patients without CAD (sensitivity = 80\%,
   CI, 72 to 87; specificity = 72\%, CI, 64 to 80; accuracy = 77\%, CI, 70
   to 85), Sensitivity and accuracy rates were higher by using the
   criterion of any defect than by using the criterion of reversible
   defects only (80\% vs 51 \%, P <.0001; 77\% vs 60 \%, P <.01,
   respectively). The sensitivity rate was higher in patients with
   multivessel CAD than in patients with single-vessel CAD (88\% vs 63\%, P
   <.05). Patients with multivessel CAD had a larger stress perfusion
   defect score (4.5 +/- 3.1 vs 2.7 +/- 2.5, P <.01) than patients with
   single-vessel CAD.
   Conclusion. Dobutamine stress Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT is a useful
   method for the diagnosis and localization of CAD in patients with
   limited exercise capacity. Optimal accuracy of the technique is achieved
   by using both fixed and reversible perfusion abnormalities for the
   diagnosis of CAD in patients without an earlier myocardial infarction.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To explore the perceived life and identity changes described by
   individuals following a single stroke using a life narrative approach.
   Method: Individuals admitted to hospital with a stroke, no previous
   disability, returning home; took part in life narrative interviews in
   hospital, and six months and one year post-discharge. The Gross Motor
   subscale of the Rivermead Motor Assessment and Nottingham 10 point
   Activities of Daily Living Scale were completed.
   Results: Eight stroke respondents (five male, three female; mean age 67
   years (range 56-82). The one year mean motor score was 9 (range 7-11)
   and self-care score was 9 (range 7-10). All respondents described a
   fundamental change in their lives and identity. The main issue was a
   split between themselves and their body. In hospital their body appeared
   to become separate, precarious and perplexing. By one year the majority
   still found their body unreliable, and their physical ability influenced
   by the social setting.
   Conclusion: The new experience of a split between self and body appears
   to be the focus of life for at least a year. This study suggests that
   rehabilitation professionals should consider longer-term (although not
   necessarily intensive) physical activity programmes that address these
   psychological as well as neuromuscular changes.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetics of ring openings of 2-phenyl-substituted cyclobutylcarbinyl
   radicals were studied by laser fash photolysis methods employing
   N-hydroxypyridine-2-thione (PTOC) esters as radical precursors. The
   radicals studied were (trans-2-phenylcyclobutyl)methyl (1a),
   1-(trans-2-phenylcyclobutyl)ethyl (Ib),
   1-methyl-1-(trans-2-phenylcyclobutyl)ethyl (Ic),
   (cis-2-phenylcyclobutyl)methyl (2a), 1-(cis-2-phenylcyclobutyl)ethyl
   (2b) and (ethoxycarbonyl),(trans-2-phenylcyclobutyl)methyl (13).
   Arrhenius parameters for radicals 1 were determined in THF and
   acetonitrile and those for radicals 2 were determined in THF. Rate
   constants fur ring openings at 20 degreesC in units of 10(7) s(-1) are
   1.3 (la), 1.0 (Ib), 0.8 (Ic), 3.2 (2a) and 3.9 (2b). These ring openings
   are more than three orders of magnitude faster than those for the parent
   cyclobutylcarbinyl radicals lacking the phenyl groups. The family can be
   used in direct studies of radical substituent effects and as internal
   reporter groups for other radical reactions, A demonstration of the
   former application is the measurement of the kinetics of ring openings
   of radical 13 which rearranges with rare constants nearly equal to those
   of the analogous methyl-substituted radical lb and, unlike radicals 1
   displays a polar solvent effect in the kinetics of the fragmentation
   reaction. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Unidirectional lateral lattice of a unit which in itself consists of
   small number of lateral-superlattice units has been fabricated from
   two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and its magnetoresistance has been

   ordinary lateral superlattice (LSL), but with much altered amplitude
   distribution; the amplitude vanishes at some index n, then increases and
   decreases with n, in marked contrast to monotonic decrease for ordinary
   LSL. The amplitude distribution is well explained by the relative
   abundance of semi-classical trajectories responsible for the
   corresponding oscillation. The spacing between peaks or dips is
   determined by the lattice period within a unit, as is the case with
   commensurability oscillation of ordinary LSL. The phase, on the other
   hand, is shown to be controlled by the distance between adjacent units,
   allowing independent manipulation of the spacing and the phase of the

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Tiam1 activates the Rho-like GTPase Rac1, and studies indicate that
   Tiam1-Rac1 signaling affects invasion in different ways depending on the
   cell type studied. However, no investigations on Tiam1 in human tumors
   have been reported. Here, we show that for 4 of 5 human renal-cell
   carcinoma (RCC) cell lines the expression levels of Tiam1 tended to be
   inversely correlated with in vitro invasiveness, whereas no obvious
   correlation could be found between the expression levels of Rac1 and
   invasion. Subsequent mutation analysis of these cell lines revealed no
   mutations in Rac1 but up to 5 different point mutations in the Tiam1
   gene. Of these, I mutation (A441G) was located in the NH2-terminal
   pleckstrin homology domain, which is essential for membrane localization
   and functional activity of Tiam1. By analysis of an additional 30
   primary human RCCs, mutation A441G was found in 4 of 35 tumors and tumor
   cell lines (11.5\%) but not in the respective normal kidney tissues. By
   enzymatic digestion, mutation A441G proved to be heterozygous,
   suggesting a dominant active function. This was supported by showing
   that stable over-expression of mutated A441G-Tiam1 induced
   transformation of NIH3T3 cells, as determined in a colony formation
   assay, whereas empty vector and wild-type Tiam1 failed to do so. In
   conclusion, a distinct Tiam1 mutation (A441G) was identified in several
   human RCCs. This mutation induced transformation of NIH3T3 cells and,
   hence, might play a major role in the progression of human RCCs. Further
   analyses on Tiam1 mutations in human tumors might give new clues to
   their role in tumor progression. Int. J. Cancer 88:369-376, 2000. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose: In earlier studies it was shown that patients with vascular
   disturbances (e.g. sudden hearing loss) had white-noise field campimetry
   abnormalities despite normal visual fields. The aim of this study was to
   clarify whether patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) have such
   disturbances in the white-noise field campimetry, too.
   Patients and methods: Twenty-four patients (m:f= 23:1; mean age 58+/-9
   years) with an angiographically documented CHD and 30 healthy controls
   (m:f= 29:1; mean age 54+/-7 years) were examined. In order to evaluate
   the morphological and functional ocular status, we examined the
   following parameters: morphological status, visual acuity, intraocular
   pressure, perimetry (Tubinger Automatic Perimeter 2000ct, Oculus) and
   white-noise field campimetry (Tubinger Electronic Campimeter, Oculus).
   Results: Fifteen patients had had a cardiac infarction. Twenty-one
   patients, but only 6 controls had alterations in perilimbal vessels of
   the conjunctiva and sixteen patients had a tortuousity of retinal
   vessels. The visual acuity, the intraocular pressure, the cup/disc ratio
   and the visual fields were within normal ranges. However, twenty
   patients and 5 controls were abnormal in the white-noise field
   campimetry.
   Discussion: Although patients with CHD appeared unaffected in the
   standard eye examinations, the disturbances in the white-noise field
   campimetry indicated a functional visual impairment. Together with the
   changes in the perilimbal vessels of the conjunctiva and the retinal
   vessels, a disturbed ocular microcirculation as the underlaying cause
   could be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Determination of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD; EC 4.3.1.8) activity
   in erythrocytes can contribute to the identification of patients
   suspected of acute intermittent porphyria. PBGD catalyses the
   polymerization of four molecules of porphobilinogen (PBG) to the highly
   unstable 1-hydroxymethylbilane. The 1-hydroxymethylbilane is transformed
   into uroporphyrinogen III by uroporphyrinogen III synthase. When this
   enzyme is inactivated, 1-hydroxymethylbilane cyclizes non-enzymatically
   to uroporphyrinogen I, which can be oxidized to uroporphyrin I. PBGD
   activity can be measured by quantitation of uroporphyrin I formed from
   PEG under conditions where this is the only end product. The purpose of
   the present study was to define the optimal conditions for quantitating
   PBGD activity in human erythrocytes. The preanalytical factors examined
   were: anticoagulants and methods for disruption of the erythrocytes. The
   analytical factors examined were: duration of preincubation, reaction
   time, reaction temperature, pH, ionic strength and conditions for the
   oxidation of uroporphyrinogen I to uroporphyrin I. Based on the results,
   we propose an optimized method for determination of PBGD activity in
   erythrocytes.}},

Abstract = {{The surface molecule CD4 plays a key role in initiating cellular entry
   by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and it is now
   recognized as acting synergistically with select chemokine receptors
   (coreceptors) in the infection process. The present study was undertaken
   to determine whether the extracellular region of CD4 is sufficient to
   induce fusion of HIV-1 virions with target cells in the absence of its
   anchoring function. Using pseudotype reporter viruses to quantitate
   infection, soluble CD4 (sCD4) was tested for its ability to induce
   fusion by viruses utilizing CCR5 as their coreceptor. We found that sCD4
   was competent to replace membrane-bound CD4 to trigger infection
   mediated by several HIV-1 envelopes. Furthermore, in a comparison of the
   envelopes of HIV-1 NL4-3 and a chimera containing the gp120 V3 loop of
   Ba-L, the V3 region was found to be one factor affecting susceptibility
   to induction by sCD4. In addition, using truncated and mutant
   derivatives of sCD4, the amino-terminal D1 domain of CD4 was found to be
   necessary and sufficient for induction of fusion and to require an
   intact gp120-binding site for this activity. These results delineate
   determinants on CD4 and gp120 required for fusion induction in
   collaboration with a coreceptor, and suggest a mechanism whereby CD4 may
   contribute to viral infection in trans.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To improve the treatment technique for chest wall irradiation,
   using the multileaf collimator (MLC) of the MM50 Racetrack Microtron to
   shape both photon and electron beams, and to check the dose delivery in
   the match-line region of these fields for the routine and improved
   technique.
   Methods and Materials: Using diode and film phantom measurements, the
   optimal number of photon beam segments and their positions relative to
   the electron beam were determined. On phantoms, and during actual
   patient treatment using in vivo dosimetry, the dose homogeneity in the
   match-line region was determined for both the routine and improved
   techniques.
   Results: Three photon beam segments (9-mm gap, perfect match, and 9-mm
   overlap) were used to match the electron beam, resulting in
   minimum-maximum dose values in the match-line region of 88-109\%,
   compared to 80-115\% for the routine technique (2 photon beam segments).
   During patient treatment, the average minimum and maximum dose values
   were 95\% and 115\%, respectively, compared to 78\% and 127\%,
   respectively, for the routine technique. The interfraction variation in
   dose delivery was reduced from 11.0\% (1 SD) to 4.6\% (1 SD). The actual
   treatment time was reduced from 10 to 4.5 min.
   Conclusion: Using the MLC of the MM50 to shape both photon and electron
   beams, an improved treatment technique for chest wall irradiation was
   developed, which is less labor intensive, faster, and yields a more
   homogeneous, and better reproducible dose delivery. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{During the past 20 years, much has been learned about how porcine
   somatotropin (pST) affects growth and nutrient partitioning in growing
   pigs. The development of techniques to produce large quantities of
   recombinantly derived pST enabled numerous long-term studies to be
   conducted in which the effects of daily pST administration could be
   evaluated. Collectively, these studies established that treatment of
   growing pigs with pST markedly stimulated muscle growth and,
   concurrently, reduced fat deposition. In growing pigs, maximally
   effective doses of pST increase average daily gain as much as 10-20\%,
   improve feed efficiency 15- 30\%, decrease adipose tissue mass and lipid
   accretion rates by as much as 50-80\% and concurrently increase protein
   deposition by 50\%. These effects are associated with a decrease in feed
   intake of similar to 10-15\%. These responses occur because pST has a
   wide array of biological effects that modulate nutrient partitioning
   between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The decrease in adipose
   tissue growth is due to a reduction in lipogenesis that is the
   consequence of pST blunting the effects of many insulin-dependent
   events. With respect to fatty acid synthase (FAS), a pace-setting enzyme
   in the lipogenic pathway, enzyme activity is markedly reduced by pST.
   This is the result of a pST-mediated decrease in FAS mRNA levels that
   occurs because FAS gene transcription is decreased. The consequence of
   the decrease in lipid synthesis is that adipocyte hypertrophy is
   impaired and, hence, tissue growth. This review will provide an overview
   of some of the biological effects of pST in adipose tissue and will
   discuss what is known about the underlying mechanisms that account for
   these effects.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: to assess the key symptoms and physical signs in the acutely
   injured knee that are significantly associated with fracture and utilise
   these to develop an algorithm for the use of radiography in acute knee
   trauma. Design: retrospective review of all acute knee injuries
   presenting to the accident and emergency unit at a District General
   Hospital over a 6-month period in 1998 (over 500 cases). After
   exclusions, a study group of 370 eligible adults was obtained. These
   patients were reviewed for the key symptoms and physical signs, and
   radiological evidence of Fracture. Overcome measures: the X-ray films
   were interpreted by a consultant radiologist, Of those patients on whom
   radiographs were not performed, follow up was assessed by a review of
   any re-attendance to the A\&E department. Results: there was a
   statistically significant correlation, using chi-square
   (Mantel-Haentzel) and linear regression analysis, between the presence
   of a fracture and each of the following variables: age,
   non-weightbearing in the department (p <0.05), haemarthrosis, point bony
   tenderness, effusion (p < 0.001). Conclusion: these key symptoms and
   physical signs may form the basis of an algorithm for examining knees
   radiologically, with acceptable positive and negative predictive values.

Abstract = {{The administration of selective a 1 (phenylephrine)-, beta
   (isoproterenol)-, or mixed (epinephrine) adrenergic agonists induces a
   marked Mg2+ extrusion from perfused rat livers. In the absence of
   extracellular Ca2+, phenylephrine does not induce a detectable Mg2+
   extrusion, isoproterenol-induced Mg2+ mobilization is unaffected, and
   epinephrine induces a net Mg2+ extrusion that is lower than in the
   presence of extracellular Ca2+ and quantitatively similar to that
   elicited by isoproterenol. In the absence of extracellular Na+, no Mg2+
   is extruded from the liver irrespective of the agonist used. Similar
   results are observed in perfused livers stimulated by glucagon or
   8-chloroadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. In the absence of
   extracellular Na+ or Ca2+, adrenergic-induced glucose extrusion from the
   liver is also markedly decreased. Together, these results indicate that
   liver cells extrude Mg2+ primarily via a Na+-dependent mechanism. This
   extrusion pathway can be activated by the increase in cellular cAMP that
   follows the stimulation by glucagon or a specific beta -adrenergic
   receptor agonist or, alternatively, by the changes in cellular Ca2+
   induced by the stimulation of the alpha (1)-adrenoceptor. In addition,
   the stimulation of the alpha (1)-adrenoceptor appears to activate an
   auxiliary Ca2+-dependent Mg2+ extrusion pathway. Finally, our data
   suggest that experimental conditions that affect Mg2+ mobilization also
   interfere with glucose extrusion from liver cells.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of soil pH on
   yield and its components and nutrients uptake by three upland rice
   cultivars/lines in a Dark-Red Latosol, clay loam texture of Cerrado
   region. A greenhouse experiment was conducted at the Embrapa-Centro
   Nacional de Pesquisa de Arroz e Feijao, Santo Antonio de Goias, GO,
   Brazil. Soil pH levels created by application of lime were 4.6, 5.7,
   6.2, 6.4, 6.6, and 6.8 and cultivars/lines tested were CNA 7460,
   Araguaia and CNA 7449. Dry matter and grain yield and yield components
   and nutrient absorption were significantly affected with soil pH.
   Adequate soil pH for yield and yield components was in the range of 5 to
   5.4 and for the nutrients 4.6 to 5.5. These results suggest that rice
   cultivars tested were quite tolerant to soil acidity and it is possible
   to produce satisfactory crop in the pH range of 5 to 5.5.}},

Abstract = {{In synchronous CDMA system, the orthogonal spreading sequences are
   employed to reduce the multiple access interference. However, as the
   frequency selectivity of the prop agation channel strengthens, the
   orthogonality among different users tends to diminish because of
   increasing inter-path interference. in this paper, various binary and
   nonbinary orthogonal sequences are discussed. In order to maintain the
   orthogonality among different users, a new concept of generalized
   orthogonality is defined and the corresponding sequences are presented,
   including binary, quadriphase and nonbinary code sequences. Based on a
   simplified synchronous CDMA. system model, the related system
   performance is also analyzed and compared for different orthogonal and
   generalized orthogonal spreading sequences. Our analytical and
   simulation results show that the generalized orthogonal code sequences
   are indeed more robust in the multipath propagation channels, compared
   with the traditional orthogonal code sequences.}},

Volume = {{203}},

Abstract = {{Although early work on the tettigoniid T large fiber suggested that it
   might mediate early-warning and escape behavior in katydids, the
   majority of research thereafter has focused on the ability of the T-cell
   to detect, localize and/or discriminate mate-calling song.
   Interestingly, T-cell responses to conspecific song are rarely examined
   for more than a few seconds, despite the fact that many katydids sing
   for minutes or hours at a time. In this paper, the second of a pair
   examining the physiology of the T-cell in Neoconocephalus ensiger, we
   recorded T-cell responses using longer-duration playbacks (3 min) of
   conspecific song (Katydid signal 30ms syllables, 9-25kHz bandwidth,
   12-15kHz peak frequency) and two types of bat-like ultrasound, a 10ms,
   80-->30kHz frequency-modulated sweep (Bat 10 signal) and a 30ms,
   80-->30kHz frequency-modulated sweep (Bat 30 signal), Spiking responses
   were distinctly biased towards the short-duration ultrasonic signal,
   with more spikes per pulse, at a shorter spike latency and at a higher
   instantaneous firing frequency to the Bat 10 signal than to the Katydid
   signal or, surprisingly, to the Bat 30 signal. The ability of the T-cell
   to encode the temporal pattern of the stimulus was particularly
   striking. Only for the predatory bat signals did T-cell spiking
   faithfully copy the stimulus; playbacks of conspecific song resulted in
   significantly weaker spiking responses, particularly in male katydids,
   The results demonstrate that responses from the T-cell alone may be
   sufficient for katydids to discriminate biologically relevant signals
   pertinent to the phonotactic behavior patterns involved in mate
   attraction and predator avoidance.}},

   measured. Simultaneous operation of the hollow cathode plasma source and
   powering of the substrate holder, however, increases the ion density up
   to 2 x 10(11) cm(-3). As expected, high ion concentrations yield high
   deposition rates with 70-80 and 160-200 nm min(-1) for methane and
   acetylene (stationary deposition mode), respectively. The DLC films were
   characterized by micro-Raman spectroscopy, ellipsometry and
   microhardness measurements. It was found that even in the stationary
   deposition mode, film thickness variations across a 5-inch wafer did not
   exceed +/-3.5\%. The highest deposition rate and best film quality were
   obtained at a substrate holder bias of - 350 to - 420 V. Methane-derived
   films showed refractive indices ranging from 2.1 to 2.3 at 632 nn and a
   Vickers microhardness of up to 30 GPa. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Antibiotic laden spacer blocks frequently are used to treat an infected
   total knee arthroplasty. Static spacer blocks make exposure at
   reimplantation difficult secondary to quadriceps shortening. Unexpected
   bone loss attributable to migration of the spacer block also has been
   reported. To avoid these problems, a temporary articulating molded
   implant made of antibiotic cement was used in a consecutive series. The
   authors sought to determine whether its use would affect the reinfection
   rate, improve functional results, or prevent bone loss compared with
   static spacers. Twenty-five patients were treated with static
   nonarticulating spacers. Since 1996, 30 patients have been treated with
   tobramycin-laden articulating spacers. The knee arthroplasties in three
   patients treated with a static spacer became reinfected (12\%). The knee
   arthroplasty in one patient with an articulating spacer became
   reinfected (7\%). Fifteen of the 25 patients with static spacers had
   unexpected bone loss between stages. No appreciable bone loss could be
   measured in the patients who received articulating spacers. The average
   Hospital for Special Surgery score was 83 points in the patients with
   static spacers and 84 points for the patients with articulating spacers.
   Range of motion at final followup averaged 98 degrees in the patients
   who received static spacers and 105 degrees in the patients who received
   articulating spacers. Articulating spacers seem to facilitate
   reimplantation of infected total knee arthroplasty without additional
   risk of infection. Unexpected bone loss is no longer a concern with this
   two-stage technique. Articulating spacers offered no functional
   advantage over static spacers in this study group.}},

Title = {{Acute cardiac ischemia in patients with cocaine-associated complaints:
   Results of a multicenter trial}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{469-476}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: To describe the characteristics of a large group of
   patients who presented to emergency departments with cocaine-associated
   symptoms consistent with acute cardiac ischemia (ACI) and to determine
   the incidence of confirmed ACI including acute myocardial infarction
   (AMI) in this population.
   Methods: We performed a substudy on all patients in a multicenter
   prospective clinical trial (the Acute Cardiac Ischemia-Time Insensitive
   Predictive Instrument {[}ACI-TIPI] Clinical Trial) that enrolled ED
   patients with chest pain or other symptoms consistent with ACI including
   subjects with identified cocaine use. Demographic and clinical features,
   including initial and follow-up clinical data, ECGs, and tests to
   determine serum creatine kinase isoenzyme MB subunit concentrations,
   were analyzed. Diagnoses of AMI followed the World Health Organization
   criteria for AMI and of angina pectoris, the Canadian Cardiovascular
   Society Classification.
   Results: Of the 10,689 patients enrolled in the trial, 293 (2.7\%) had
   cocaine-associated complaints. Among the 10 participating hospitals, the
   incidence of patients with cocaine-associated symptoms varied from 0.3\%
   to 8.4\%. Only 6 patients (2.0\%, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.76\%
   to 4.4\%) had a diagnosis of ACI; 4 (1.4\%, 95\% CI 0.37\% to 3.5\%) had
   unstable angina, and 2 (0.7\%, 95\% Ci 0.08\% to 2.4\%) had AMI.
   Although patients with cocaine-induced complaints were as likely to be
   admitted to the coronary care unit compared with all study patients
   without cocaine use (14\% versus 18\%, P=.14, difference not
   significant), these patients were much less likely to have confirmed
   unstable angina (1.4\% versus 9.3\%, P<.001) or AMI (0.7\% versus 8.6\%,
   P<.001). Compared with patients younger than 45 years, patients with
   cocaine usage were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (14\% versus
   8.0\%, P=.0018) but less likely to have confirmed AMI (0.7\% versus
   2.8\%, P=.033).
   Conclusion: Patients presenting to EDs with cocaine-associated chest
   pain or related symptoms infrequently had ACI, and even less so, AMI.
   This suggests the need for selectivity in the hospitalization of
   patients with such cocaine-associated symptoms.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We construct the three dimensional mirror theory of SO(2k) and SO(2k +
   1) gauge groups by using O3-planes. An essential ingredient in
   constructing the mirror is the splitting of a physical brane (NS-brane
   or D5-brane) on O3-planes. In particular, matching the dimensions of
   moduli spaces of mirror pair (for example, the SO(2k + 1) and its
   mirror) there is a D3-brane creation or annihilation accompanying the
   splitting. This novel dynamical process gives a nontrivial prediction
   for strongly coupled field theories, which will be very interesting to
   check by Seiberg-Witten curves. Furthermore, applying the same idea, we
   revisit the mirror theory of Sp(k) gauge group and find new mirrors
   which differ from previously known results. Our new result for Sp(k)
   gives another example to a previously observed fact, which shows that
   different theories can be mirror to the same theory. We also discussed
   the phenomena such as ``hidden FI-parameters{''} when the number of
   flavors and the rank of the gauge group satisfy certain relations,
   ``incomplete higgsing{''} for the mirror of SO(2k + 1) and the ``hidden
   global symmetry{''}. After discussing the mirror for a single Sp or SO
   gauge group, we extend the study to a product of two gauge groups in two
   different models, namely the elliptic and the non-elliptic models.}},

Abstract = {{In the first part of this paper we briefly review some basic concepts of
   kinetic theory. The concept of the velocity distribution function is
   first introduced and its meaning is discussed. Then, the Boltzmann
   equation is presented on physical grounds and it is shown that the fluid
   equations are its moments. In the second part, the Boltzmann equation
   for free electrons in a low-temperature plasma is analysed. It is shown
   how this equation can approximately be solved for electrons under a HF
   field of frequency omega (including the particular case of a de field,
   which corresponds to the limit omega = 0) by using a first-order double
   expansion in spherical harmonics in velocity space and a Fourier series

Abstract = {{The soluble form of guanylyl cyclase (sGC) plays a pivotal role in the
   transduction of inter- and intracellular signals conveyed by nitric
   oxide. Here, a feedback inhibitory mechanism triggered by cyclic
   guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKG)
   activation is described. Preincubation of chromaffin cells with C-type
   natriuretic peptide, which increased cGMP levels and activated PKG, or
   with cGMP-permeant analogue (which also activates PKG), in the presence
   of a broad-spectrum phosphodiesterase inhibitor, resulted in a decrease
   in subsequent sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-dependent cGMP elevations. This
   inhibitory effect was mimicked by activating a protein phosphatase and
   counteracted by the selective PKG inhibitor KT-5823 and by different
   protein phosphatase inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation of sGC from cells
   submitted to different treatments followed by immunodetection with
   antiphosphoserine antibodies (clone 4A9) showed changes in
   phosphorylation levels of the beta subunit of sGC, and these changes
   correlated well with differences in SNP-elicited cGMP accumulations.
   Pretreatment of cells with several PKG inhibitors or protein phosphatase
   inhibitors produced an enhancement of SNP-stimulated cGMP rises without
   changing the SNP concentration required to produce half-maximal or
   maximal responses. Taken together, these results indicate that the
   catalytic activity of sGC is closely coupled to the phosphorylation
   state of its beta subunit and that the tonic activity of PKG or its
   stimulation regulates sGC activity through dephosphorylation of the beta
   subunit.}},

Abstract = {{Airborne scanner data collected in the thermal band over the Orbetello
   lagoon on 14 May 1993 were used to draw out a water surface temperature
   map. The geometric correction method was chosen after a quantitative
   comparison between the classic polynomial method and a technique based
   on matching Delaunay triangles. Sensor raw data were calibrated and
   striping noise was removed. Finally, a new atmospheric correction method
   was developed. The method consists of extracting, from the superimposed
   portion of two images, couples of measurements relative to the same
   resolution cell observed under two different angles. From these
   measurements we retrieved the atmospheric transmittance and integrated
   emitted radiance using an iterative algorithm capable of reducing the
   effects of measurement errors and taking into account the nonlinearity
   of the derived equations. The variation of surface emissivity with
   observation angle is also taken into account in the equations. In order
   to apply the method, the unknown covariance matrix of the parameters to
   be retrieved was valued. To this aim, we generated many statistical
   realizations of such atmospheric radiative quantities using the Lowtran
   7 code applied to a large number of radiosoundings. The obtained
   atmospheric parameters were then used to correct the entire set of
   collected images and to produce a temperature map of the lagoon.}},

Abstract = {{Neurological impairment is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality
   in patients with sarcoidosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   clinical manifestations of the disease, the response to corticosteroids
   and alternative treatments. During a 5 year period, diagnosis of
   neurosarcoidosis was performed in 40 patients. We retrospectively
   analyzed clinical, laboratory data and response to treatments. Mean age
   was 41.3 years (range 17-72), Mean time of follow-up was 46 months.
   Neurologic signs were the first symptom in 50p.100 of cases and an
   isolated manifestation in 12.5p.100. Central nervous system impairment
   was seen in 60.7p.100, meningitis in 27p.100. Other clinical
   manifestations were cranial nerve palsies (27p.100), peripheral
   neuropathy (33p.100), myopathy (16p.100). Eighty percent of the patients
   were treated by corticosteroids. Because of a lack of efficacy 40p.100
   of patient required alternative treatment (including methotrexate,
   cyclophosphamide, azathioprin, cyclosporin). Complete recovery was
   observed in only 27.5p.100 of cases confirming the severity of
   neurosarcoidosis. Forty percent of patients were clinically stable and
   10p.100 worsened. No patient died. This study confirms that intensive
   initial treatment is often necessary to prevent irreversible lesions.
   Alternative treatment should be rapidly initiated in resistant forms.}},

Number = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Transcription factors of the CREB family control the expression of a
   large number of genes in response to various signaling pathways.
   Regulation mediated by members of the CREB family has been linked to
   various physiological functions. Classically, activation by CREB is
   known to occur upon phosphorylation at an essential regulatory site
   (Ser133 in CREB) and the subsequent interaction with the ubiquitous
   coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP). However, the mechanism by which
   selectivity is achieved in the identification of target genes, as well
   as the routes adopted to ensure tissue-specific activation, remains
   unrecognized. We have recently described the first tissue-specific
   coactivator of CREB family transcription factors, ACT (activator of CREM
   in testis). ACT is a LIM-only protein which associates with CREM in male
   germ cells and provides an activation function which is independent of
   phosphorylation and CBP. Here we characterize a family of LIM-only
   proteins which share common structural organization with ACT. These are
   referred to as four-and-a-half-LIM-domain (FHL) proteins and display
   tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression. FHL proteins
   display different degrees of intrinsic activation potential. They
   provide powerful activation function to both CREB and CREM when
   coexpressed either in yeast or in mammalian cells, specific combinations
   eliciting selective activation. Deletion analysis of the ACT protein
   shows that the activation function depends on specific arrangements of
   the LIM domains, which are essential for both transactivation and
   interaction properties. This study uncovers the existence of a family of
   tissue-specific coactivators that operate through novel, CBP-independent
   routes to elicit transcriptional activation by CREB and CREM. The future
   identification of additional partners of PHL proteins is likely to
   reveal unappreciated aspects of tissue-specific transcriptional
   regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Nutritional rickets is common in Nigeria where vitamin D deficiency is
   rare and dietary insufficiency of calcium is common. It occurs more
   commonly in siblings of affected children than of unaffected children.
   Postulating that vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms might relate to
   the susceptibility of some Nigerian children to develop rickets in the
   setting of low calcium intake, we compared the VDR genotypes, as
   determined by the presence or absence of Bsm I, Apa I, Tag I, and Fok I
   restriction enzyme cleavage sites, between 105 children with active
   nutritional rickets and 94 subjects representative of the community from
   which the rachitic children came. In the rickets group, the ff genotype
   was less common than in the community group, and the FF genotype was
   relatively increased (f allele frequency, 17\% in rachitic children and
   26\% in the community group, p = 0.03), Neither individual allele
   frequencies for the other polymorphisms nor combinations of genotypes at
   different sites were different between the rachitic and community
   groups. Although it is not clear why a presumed better-functioning VDR
   variant (F allele) is associated with an increased risk of developing
   rickets, this study raises the possibility that VDR alleles might be
   important in determining an individual's susceptibility to developing
   rickets when faced with dietary calcium deficiency.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The investigations show that it is possible to develop hybrid light
   filters which could be switched by solar as well as by electrical
   energy. The light filters are based on thermotropic gels changing their
   transmission depending on the concentration of the cross-linker from
   60\% to 80\% to less than or equal to 1\% in the temperature range 29-36
   degrees C. Detailed investigations of the electrical switching process
   show that the switching times significantly decrease with increasing
   thickness of the tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) used as transparent
   electrodes. The switching times could be varied from 3 to over 50 min.
   Furthermore, the required wattage for the switching process
   significantly decreases with increasing thickness of the ITO-layers. A
   gel layer having a thickness of 2 mm is quite enough to realize changes
   in the transmission from about 62\% to less than or equal to 1\%.
   Comparable results were obtained for light filters having a size of
   either 25 or 180 cm(2), respectively. Therefore, it should be possible
   to transfer these results to light filters having a size of 0.5-1 m(2).

Abstract = {{Different versions for defining Ashtekar's generalized connections are
   investigated depending on the chosen smoothness category for the paths
   and graphs - the label set for the projective limit, Our definition
   covers the analytic case as well as the case of webs.
   Then the action of Ashtekar's generalized gauge group (G) over bar on
   the space (A) over bar of generalized connections is investigated for
   compact structure groups G. Here, first, the orbit types of the
   generalized connections are deter-mined. The stabilizer of a connection
   is homeomorphic to the holonomy centralizer, i.e. the centralizer of its
   holonomy group. It is proven that the gauge ol hit type of a connection
   can be defined by the G-conjugacy class of its holonomy centralizer
   equivalently to the standard definition via (G) over bar -stabilizers.
   The connections of one and the same gauge orbit type form a so-called
   stratum, As the main result of this article it slice theorem is proven
   on (A) over bar. This yields the openness of the strata. Afterwards, a
   denseness theorem is proven for the strata. Hence, (A) over bar is
   topologically regularly stratified by (G) over bar. These results
   coincide with those of Kondracki and Rogulski for Sobolev connections.
   Furthermore, the set of all gauge orbit types equals the set of all
   (conjugacy classes of) Howe subgroups of C, Finally, it is shown that
   the set of all gauge orbits: with maximal type has the full induced Haar
   measure 1.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate serum cardiac troponin I, a sensitive marker of
   cardiac myocyte damage, in normal pregnancy and pregnancies complicated
   by hypertension with and without significant proteinuria.
   Design Prospective cross sectional study.
   Setting University hospital delivery suite.
   Sample Serum samples obtained from women in normal pregnancy and in
   pregnancies complicated by hypertension with and without significant
   proteinuria.
   Method Women with hypertension in pregnancy (at least two readings of
   systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure > 90
   mmHg) (n = 26) and normotensive women (n = 43) were included in the
   study. Serum cardiac troponin I was measured using Beckman Access
   immunoassay.
   Main outcome measure Serum cardiac troponin I level in the pregnancies
   complicated by hypertension (with and without significant proteinuria)
   compared with the levels measured in normotensive women.
   Results The median serum cardiac troponin I level in pregnancies
   complicated by hypertension was 0.118 ng/mL (n = 26) which was
   significantly greater than that measured in samples obtained from
   nor-motensive women in pregnancy (0.03 ng/mL; n = 43) (P < 0.0001).
   There were higher median serum cardiac troponin I levels in hypertensive
   women with significant proteinuria (0.155 ng/mL; n = 6), compared with
   those without proteinuria (0.089 ng/mL; n = 20; P = 0.03).
   Conclusion Serum cardiac troponin I is elevated in women with
   hypertensive disorders of pregnancy indicating some degree of cardiac
   myofibrillary damage in these disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Vegans do not consume meat and fish and have therefore low intakes of
   long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP). They may consequently have
   little negative feedback inhibition from dietary LCP on conversion of
   alpha -linolenic acid (ALA) to the LCP omega3 eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and
   docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. We investigated whether supplementation of
   nine apparently healthy vegans with 2.01 g ALA (4 ml linseed oil),1.17 g
   gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) (6 ml borage oil) or their combination
   increases the LCP omega3 contents of erythrocytes (RBC) and platelets
   (PLT), and of plasma phospholipids (PL), cholesterol esters (CE) and
   triglycerides (TG). The supplements changed the dietary LA/ALA ratio (in
   g/g) from about 13.7 (baseline) to 6.8 (linseed oil), 14.3 (borage oil)
   and 6.4 (linseed + borage oil), respectively. ALA or GLA given as single
   supplements did not increase LCP omega3 status, but their combination
   augmented LCP omega3 (in CE) and EPA (in fasting TG) to a statistically
   significant, but nevertheless negligible, extent. We conclude that
   negative feedback inhibition by dietary LCP, if any, does not play an
   important role in the inability to augment notably DHA status by dietary
   ALA. The reach of a DHA plateau already at low dietary ALA intakes
   suggests that dietary DHA causes a non-functional DHA surplus, or is,
   alternatively, important for maintaining DHA status at a functionally
   relevant level. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{It may be possible to calculate the rate of reconnection in the corona
   by measuring the rate at which the temporary coronal hole formed by a
   coronal mass ejection (CME)) disappears. This calculation is possible if
   the disappearance of the hole is caused by the same reconnection process
   which creates the giant X-ray arches associated with CMEs. These arches
   form just below the vertical current sheet that is created as the CME
   drags magnetic field lines out into interplanetary space, and they are
   similar in form to `post'-flare loops, except that they often have an
   upward motion that is different. Instead of continually slowing with
   time as `post'-flare loops do, they move upwards at a rate which
   increases, or remains nearly constant, with time. This difference has
   raised doubts about the relevance of reconnection to the formation and
   propagation of the arches. Using a two-dimensional flux rope model to
   calculate the size and location of the current sheet as a function of
   time, we find that the difference between the motion of `post'-flare
   loops and giant arches can be explained simply by the variation of the
   coronal Alfven speed with height. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Synthetic Aperture Radar ( SAR) carried aboard ERS-1 and -2 has been
   used to estimate soil moisture in a naturally vegetated area of upland
   moor in Lancashire, north-west England. This holds promise for the
   determination of catchment-scale evapotranspiration rates using direct
   measurements of changes in soil moisture content. Combining such
   measurements as these with observations of net radiation from the NOAA
   AVHRR passive radiometer has led to the development of a method, based
   upon the techniques of Price (IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote
   Sensing, 28, 940-948, 1990) combined with some new methodologies,
   whereby the sensible heat flux can be found by the closure of the energy
   balance equation.
   A review of the methodology developed is presented together with the
   potential for refining the system using further instruments. There are
   limitations of the procedure due to the restricted temporal coverage of
   the sensors concerned, and their inability to penetrate the surface to
   investigate soil-water-vegetation processes within the root zone. It is
   believed, however, that models can be constructed to account for these
   deficiencies to enable retrieval of an entire surface energy and water
   budget. These would have a plethora of applications, both direct and as
   inputs to atmospheric and hydrological models.}},

Abstract = {{In order to obtain mathematical models applicable to prenatal growth of
   the ovine pineal gland, 420 embryos and fetuses at varying stages of
   development were used Tor morphometric analysis. For each of the
   following variables studied, results were expressed as mean +/- standard
   error : body weight, head weight, brain weight, pineal gland weight and
   pineal gland volume. The possible influence of sex on variables was
   determined by analysis of variance. The set of variables analysed was
   fitted to mathematical growth models. The results obtained indicate that
   during prenatal development all the variables examined fit a
   curvilinear-multiplicative growth model; additionally the increase in
   these weights exceeds increases in length, particularly in the case of
   the pineal gland, suggesting considerable prenatal development of the
   gland, especially at the perinatal stage, where there is a marked
   increase in both weight and volume. It's also discussed the possible
   influence of morphologic changes of the pineal gland in its
   physiological maturation during prenatal development and it is
   established a clear correspondence between the different phases of the
   growing curves of the pineal gland whit the ontogenic-proliferative and
   hypertrophic-differentiative phases, previously described by the authors
   in their description of the ovine pineal gland development. Finally, the
   data presented are offered to the scientific community to be used on
   future researches (i.e. in order to obtain the value of the volume or
   weight of pineal gland using the curve and the formulae displayed in a
   specific phase of development).}},

Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Study Objective: To investigate if paravertebral lumbar sympathetic
   ganglion block and lumbar epidural anesthesia result in comparable
   cutaneous temperature changes in the lower extremity.
   Design: Nonrandomized comparison study.
   Setting: Operating rooms and pain clinic procedure rooms in a tertiary
   care hospital.
   Patients and Interventions: 18 patients undergoing lumbar sympathetic
   ganglion blocks for the diagnosis and/or treatment of chronic pain, and
   13 patients undergoing lumbar epidural anesthesia for radical
   prostatectomy.
   Measurements: Cutaneous temperatures were measured over the great toe,
   calf, and thigh in all patients. Mean maximum temperature (Tmax), rate
   of change of skin temperature (from 5\% to 95\% of maximum temperature
   change), and mean time to 1 degreesC increase, and 50\% and 95\% of
   maximum temperature change for each group were compared. Temperature
   changes for the epidural and lumbar sympathetic block patients were
   compared.
   Main Results: Epidural and lumbar sympathetic block resulted in similar
   Tmax (34.1 +/- 0.2 and 33.8 +/- 0.9 degreesC, respectively, mean +/-
   SEM; p = 0.18) and rate of temperature change )0.64 +/- 0.09 and 0.49
   +/- 0.07 degreesC/min; p =0.2) in great toe. The onset of cutaneous
   temperature change after lumbar sympathetic block was slower than after
   epidural anesthesia (1 degreesC increase: 17 and 11 min, respectively,
   50\% of Tmax: 25 and 17 min, respectively, and 95\% of Tmax: 40 and 31
   min, respectively; p < 0.05 for each).
   Conclusions: The similar rate and magnitude of cutaneous temperature
   change in the distal lower extremity suggests the degree of sympathetic
   blockade is similar with lumbar sympathetic blockade and epidural
   anesthesia. Either technique should provide adequate sympathectomy for
   treating sympathetically maintained pain once the diagnosis has been
   confirmed using selective sympathetic blockade. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Due to the role of oxygen free radicals in trophoblast cell
   differentiation, we used the in vitro model of villous cytotrophoblast
   differentiation into the syncytiotrophoblast to investigate the
   modulation of the key antioxidant enzyme copper/zinc superoxide
   dismutase (SOD-1) in the human trophoblast during pregnancy.
   Cytotrophoblast cells were isolated from first-trimester and term
   placentae. SOD-1 mRNA levels were determined using real-time
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction, protein levels were determined
   by immunoblotting with a specific monoclonal antibody, and
   oxidoreductase activity was measured during syncytiotrophoblast
   formation in vitro. Interestingly, SOD-1 protein levels fell
   significantly (P<0.001) during syncytiotrophoblast formation but no
   corresponding change in enzyme activity was observed. This apparent
   discrepancy may be related to different amounts of SOD-1 co-factor in
   the two cell types. Indeed the level of copper was significantly higher
   (P<0.05) in syncytiotrophoblast as compared with cytotrophoblast. SOD-1
   mRNA levels remained stable during cytotrophoblast differentiation.
   SOD-1 expression and activity were similar in cytotrophoblast cells
   isolated from first-trimester and term placentae, and in the
   differentiated syncytiotrophoblast in vitro. These results underline the
   need to determine SOD-1 protein expression and activity simultaneously

Abstract = {{Female mice known to be susceptible (C57BL) and resistant (C3H and
   BALB/c) to diet-induced atherosclerosis were studied. Feeding of a
   cholate-containing atherogenic diet for 1 month resulted in an increase
   in plasma total cholesterol, little or no change in total phospholipids
   and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and a fall in HDL
   phospholipid, which was most pronounced in the C57BL strain. In elicited
   macrophages, cholesterol esterification was lower with acetylated low
   density lipoprotein (acLDL) and higher with beta -very low density
   lipoprotein (beta -VLDL) in C57BL than in C3H or BALB/C strains. In
   resident macrophages, acLDL enhanced cholesterol esterification more
   than did rabbit beta -VLDL. With acLDL, more apolipoprotein E (apoE) was
   recovered in all macrophage cultures. In macrophages from chow-fed mice,
   most apoE was in the medium, whereas in mice fed an atherogenic diet,
   half of the apoE was in the cells. ApoE protein was highest in
   macrophages from BALB/c mice fed an atherogenic diet; an increase in
   apoE mRNA occurred in BALB/c and C3H macrophages. Scavenger receptor
   AI/II mRNA was significantly higher in macrophages from
   atherosclerosis-resistant mice. Thus, higher HDL phospholipid and plasma
   apoE levels (reported by others), together with high macrophage
   scavenger receptor AI/II mRNA, could inhibit accretion of cholesterol in
   the vessel wall in the 2 resistant strains.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) gene polymorphism on the
   prognosis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is still debated. A longitudinal
   study of renal prognosis in patients with IgAN was conducted to search
   retrospectively for a genotype-phenotype association between RAS
   polymorphisms and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). A classification based
   on serum creatinine (S-cr) and 24-h proteinuria (24-P) measured at the
   time of renal biopsy was used to estimate the risk of ESRF in IgAN:
   stage 1 (S-cr less than or equal to 150 mu mol/L and 24-P < 1 g), stage
   2 (S-cr > 150 mu mol/L and 24-P < 1 g or S-cr <less than or equal to>
   150 mu mol/L and 24-P greater than or equal to 1 g), stage 3 (S-cr > 150
   mu mol/L and 24-P greater than or equal to 1 g). Deletion/insertion
   polymorphism (D/I) of the angiotensin I converting enzyme gene, M235T
   polymorphism (T/M) of the angiotensinogen gene and A1166C polymorphism
   (C/A) of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene were determined in 274
   Caucasian men with biopsy-proven IgAN (n = 86, 112, and 76 in stages 1,
   2, and 3, respectively). Mean global follow-up was 6 +/- 5 yr after
   renal biopsy. For stages 1, 2, and 3, ESRF developed in 7 (8.1\%), 39
   (34.8\%), and 39 (64.4\%) cases (P < 0.0001), 11.7 +/- 4, 5.3 +/- 4, and
   2 +/- 2 yr, respectively, after renal biopsy (P < 0.001). The
   distributions of the three genotypes into the three stages were similar.
   Different distributions were observed when patients were grouped by
   stage and genotype: ID + DD: 72\% in stage 1 versus 84.6\% in stages 2 +
   3 (P = 0.02; kappa = 0.14); MT + TT: 66.2\% in stages 1 + 2 versus
   78.9\% in stage 3 (P = 0.04; kappa = 0.09); and AA + AC: 89.9\% in
   stages 1 + 2 versus 97.4\% in stage 3 (P = 0.04; kappa = -0.1). However,
   with the use of the Cox proportional hazard model, none of the three
   genotypes was found to have predictive value fur renal survival.
   Compared with S-cr and 24-P, genotypes DD, TT, and AA are unlikely to
   serve as clinically useful predictors of ESRF in IgAN.}},

Abstract = {{Sixty male BALB/c mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with either a
   sublethal or a lethal dose of Burkholderia mallei China 7 strain, then
   killed at multiple time points postinoculation. Histopathologic changes
   were qualitatively similar in both groups and consisted of
   pyogranulomatous inflammation. In sublethal study mice, changes were
   first seen at 6 hours in mediastinal lymph nodes, then in spleen, liver,
   peripheral lymph nodes, and bone marrow at day 3. These changes
   generally reached maximal incidence and severity by day 4 but decreased
   by comparison in all tissues except the liver. Changes were first seen
   in lethal study mice also at 6 hours in mediastinal lymph nodes and in
   spleens. At day 1, changes were present in liver, peripheral lymph
   nodes, and bone marrow. The incidence and severity of these changes were
   maximal at day 2. In contrast to sublethal study mice, the incidence and
   severity of the changes did not decrease through the remainder of the
   study. The most significant difference between the two groups was the
   rapid involvement of the spleen in the lethal study mice. Changes
   indicative of impaired vascular perfusion were more frequently seen in
   the sublethal study mice. Our findings indicate that mice are
   susceptible to B. mallei infection and may serve as an appropriate model
   for glanders infection in a resistant host such as human beings.

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1 Local pressure-induced vasodilation (PIV) is a neural vasodilator
   response to non-nociceptive externally applied pressure in the skin,
   previously described in humans. We first determined whether PIV exists
   ill rats and depends on capsaicin-sensitive fibres as it does in humans.
   We then examined the mediators involved in the efferent pathway of PTV.
   2 Cutaneous blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry during
   11.1 Pa s(-1) increases in local applied pressure in anaesthetized rats.
   The involvement of capsaicin-sensitive fibres in PTV was tested in rats
   treated neonatally with capsaicin. To antagonize CORP, neurokinin-l, -2,
   or -3 receptors, different groups of rats were treated with CGRP(8-37),
   SR140333, SR48968 or SR142801, respectively. Prostaglandins involvement
   was tested with indomethacin treatment. To inhibit nitric oxide synthase
   (NOS) activity or specific neuronal NOS, rats were treated with
   N-G-nitro-L-arginine or 7-nitroindazole, respectively.
   3 PIV was found in rats, as in humans. PIV was abolished by neonatal
   treatment with capsaicin and by administration of CGRP(8-37) but
   remained unchanged with SR140333, SR48968 and SR142801 treatments.
   Prostaglandin inhibition resulted in a significant decrease in PIV.
   Inhibition of NOS abolished PIV, whereas inhibition of neuronal NOS
   caused a diminution of PN.
   4 These data suggest that PIV depends on capsaicin-sensitive fibres in
   rats, as in humans. II appears that CGRP plays a major role in the PTV,
   whereas neurokinins have no role. Furthermore, PIV involves a
   contribution from prostaglandins and depends on endothelial NO, whereas
   neuronal NO has a smaller role.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally agreed that, for a given handwriting recognition task, a
   user dependent system usually outperforms a user independent system, as
   long as a sufficient amount of training data is available. When the
   amount of user training data is limited, however, such a performance
   gain is not guaranteed. One way to improve the performance is to make
   use of existing knowledge, contained in a rich multiuser data base, so
   that a minimum amount of training data is sufficient to initialize a
   model for the new user, We mainly address the user adaption issues for a
   handwriting recognition system, Based on self-growing probabilistic
   decision-based neural networks (SPDNNs), user adaptation of the
   parameters of SPDNN is formulated as incremental reinforced and
   antireinforced learning procedures, which are easily integrated into the
   batched training procedures of the SPDNN, In this study, me developed 1)
   an SPDNN based handwriting recognition system; 2) a two-stage
   recognition structure; and 3) a three-phase training methodology for a)
   a global coarse classifier (stage 1); b) a user independent hand written
   character recognizer (stage 2); and c) a user adaptation module on a
   personal computer. With training and testing on a 600-word commonly used
   Chinese character set, the recognition results indicate that the user
   adaptation module significantly improved the recognition accuracy The
   average recognition rate increased from 44.2\% to 82.4\% in five
   adapting cycles, and the performance could finally increase up to 90.2\%
   in ten adapting cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Mean sonic transit times from eight stratigraphic units in forty-four
   wells in western and northern offshore Taiwan were plotted against
   depth. Apparent erosion (displacement on the depth axis from the normal
   compaction) was determined for each unit in each well. Cretaceous and
   Eocene units show greater apparent erosion than Miocene and Pliocene
   units in the same well, which in turn show more erosion than Pleistocene
   units. Apparent erosions derived from two different units are plotted
   against each other for correlation analysis. Based on the analysis, the
   main periods of erosion were during the Oligocene and Plio-Pleistocene.
   The timing of erosion inferred from sonic interval transit is consistent
   with recognized unconformities, and its areal distribution is consistent
   with the observed structural evolution of the region. The maximum true
   erosion (connected for post-erosion burial) at the Oligocene
   unconformity was 3500 m on the Penghu Platform. Approximately 2500 m of
   true erosion occurred on the Kuanin Ulift and the Pengchiahsu Platform.
   Due to moderate-to-minor erosion and a great amount of post-erosion
   burial, true magnitude of erosion is masked at the Miocene unconformity
   in most of the area.
   Erosion of up to 500 m on the eastern side of the Penghu Island at the
   Pleistocene unconformity defines the shape of the present-day Penghu
   Waterway. In the northern offshore area up to 1000 m of
   Plio/Pleistocene, true erosion occurred in the Taiwan-Sinzi folded zone
   where Miocene folds are observed. The magnitude of true erosion
   decreased west of the Taiwan-Sinzi folded zone to 500 m in the
   Pengchiahsu Basin. A maximum of 500 m of true erosion is also observed
   in the west offshore area along Hsing-Chu to Miaoli coast. (C) 2000

   which were taken at 1 week and 6 months postoperatively,
   Setting: The research was carried out at the Department of Plastic and
   Reconstructive Surgery of the Nagasaki University School of Medicine.
   Patients: A total of 32 patients who underwent only sagittal split
   osteotomies and mandibular set back in our unit was included in this
   study. Of these patients, 17 patients were osteosynthesized
   monocortically, and 15 patients were osteosynthesized bicortically.
   Main Outcome Measures: Four measurements-genial angle (GA), mandibular
   plane (MP), SNB, and percentage of upper face to total face height
   (percent upper to total face)-were completed to evaluate postoperative
   mandibular movement.
   Result: Statistical analyses of cephalometric measurements (GA, MP, SNB,
   and percent upper face to total face height) showed that monocortical
   fixed mandibles were more changeable postoperatively on the GA and
   percent upper face to total face height, but MP and SNB showed no
   significant differences among the groups.
   Conclusion: These findings suggested that the postoperative excessive
   shear force stress, produced by the compressive action of the masseter
   muscle, transformed the mandibular shape as the distal segment rotated
   clockwise and proximal segment rotated counterclockwise. Consequently,
   the mandible was bent at the miniplate, It was concluded that bicortical
   osteosynthesis was more rigid against this shearing stress than
   monocortical osteosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Relatively few data are available about Haemophilus
   influenzae (Hi) infection among adults
   Materials and Methods: We studied all adult patients with Hi infection
   hospitalized between 1988 and 1997 at the University Hospital of Berne.
   Data were abstracted retrospectively from clinical charts and
   microbiology records using a standardized questionnaire.
   Results: 12 invasive and 19 noninvasive Hi infections were observed
   during the study period. The main clinical manifestations were pneumonia
   (38.7\%), bronchitis (29.0\%) and meningitis (12.9\%). Most patients
   (71.8\%) had an underlying condition. Lethality was high (22.6\%),
   especially in pneumonia patients (50\%). The frequency of meningitis
   caused by Hi serotype b (Hib) seemed to decrease after 1990 when
   conjugated vaccines against Hib were introduced.
   Conclusion: Hi remains an important cause of lower respiratory and
   invasive disease associated with high lethality among polymorbid adult
   patients. The frequency of Hib infections may also decrease in adults
   due to herd immunity induced by universal vaccination of children.}},

Abstract = {{The intensity point spread function (PSF) for geometric imaging such as
   occurs in a projection electron system like SCALPEL is derived
   analytically from the ray aberration coefficients. The results show
   that, as expected, the PSF for ordinary aberrations has a finite radius
   and is not Gaussian. Hence blur estimates, which are often based on
   assuming a Gaussian PSF and computing the root-sum-square or ``rss{''}
   of the separate blur radii will generally overestimate the true
   aberration blur. Global space charge acts like an electrostatic lens and
   hence its effects can be included in the PSF calculation as well. The
   net PSF can be convolved with an object to produce an accurate
   representation of the image. The convolution integral can also be
   performed first which yields the image intensity distribution directly
   in terms of the aberrations. (C) 2000 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{A number of cross-linkers that are commonly used in polyacrylamide gels
   have been incubated with bovine beta -lactoglobulin B and the resulting
   reaction mixtures were examined by matrix assisted laser
   desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry. At concentrations of 0.1, 1,
   and 20 mM of each cross-linker incubated for 1 h with 50 pmol/muL of the
   protein, a reactivity scale can be expressed as polyethylene glycol
   diacrylate > N,N'-bisacrylylcystamine > bisacrylyl piperazine,
   N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide >> N,N'-wdiallyltartardiamide
   (PEGDA>BAC>BAP>Bis>>DATD). Relatively short incubation times indicated
   one of the five Cys residues as the target of reaction, which was
   confirmed by post-source decay measurements. Longer incubation times (24
   h) with bisacrylamide extended the reaction to all five Cys residues and
   a number of Lys residues. A second consequence of longer reaction time
   is the involvement of both terminals of the cross-linker in the observed
   reaction. This experimental evidence is the first to demonstrate a
   different reactivity of both ends of one of the most commonly used
   cross-linkers. Investigation of solutions containing a cross-linker and
   acrylamide monomers provided useful information on the competition
   between the two identities for reaction with the protein. Possible
   implications of these experimental observations for isoelectric focusing
   separations in polyacrylamide gels are discussed.}},

   parameters?}},
Journal = {{INFECTION}},

Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The objectives of this study were to determine to what
   extent the German national nosocomial infection surveillance system
   (Krankenhaus Infektions Surveillance System, KISS) can take into account
   the circumstances prevailing in various intensive care units (ICUs) and
   to establish whether KISS-ICU infection rates can serve as useful
   benchmark parameters.
   Methods: The investigation focused on th ree major factors:
   microbiological monitoring, severity of illness and the duration of
   surveillance, For each of these factors separate infection rates were
   calculated for various ICU groups and the differences compared.
   Results: Significant differences were found for catheter-associated
   urinary tract infections (CAUTI) with routine monitoring, but not for
   ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Significant differences were
   assessed for central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections
   (CVCBSI), considering the average ventilator utilization rate in the ICU
   as a surrogate parameter for the average severity of illness in its
   patient group. Surveillance periods of about 1 year were necessary to
   confirm definite outlier and nonoutlier positions for the majority of
   the ICUs.
   Conclusion: Using KISS data for internal orientation, it is possible to
   note important differences between ICUs when interpreting infection
   rates; some initial examples of successful use of surveillance data for
   the reduction of infection rates are already available. However, the use
   of such data for external assessment is not possible, because external
   observers a re often unable to fully consider important factors in the
   interpretation of infection rates.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas myocardial cell injury can occur during electrical
   defibrillation proportional to the energy level of individual shocks,
   only minimal (or no) injury seems to develop when the energy is limited
   to the levels typically required to terminate ventricular fibrillation,
   During cardiac arrest, however, multiple shocks are often required to
   terminate ventricular fibrillation or to treat episodes that appear
   subsequently during the resuscitation effort or the postresuscitation
   interval. Concern exists because an inverse relationship has been
   reported between the number of electrical shocks delivered during
   cardiac resuscitation and both resuscitability and survival, Repetitive
   electrical shacks can alter diastolic function and prompt leftward
   shifts of the end-diastolic pressure-volume curves, Repetitive shocks
   may, therefore, contribute to the recently recognized phenomenon of
   postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and hamper efforts to
   reestablish competent myocardial function after resuscitation, Thus,
   strategies aimed at limiting the number of electrical shocks during
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation are highly desirable, These may include
   real-time ventricular fibrillation waveform analysis to improve
   targeting of individual shocks and efforts (using mechanical and
   pharmacologic means) to render the myocardium more responsive to
   individual shocks and to promote greater electrical stability after
   successful defibrillation.}},

Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{Fumarate reductase (FRD) is the key enzyme in fumarate respiration
   induced by anaerobic growth of bacteria. In Helicobacter pylori, this
   enzyme appears to be constitutively expressed under microaerobic
   conditions and is not essential for its survival in vitro. In this
   study, the role of FRD in the colonization of H. pylori was investigated
   using a mouse model. The frdA gene coding for subunit A of FRD, and two
   control genes, copA and copP associated with the export of copper out of
   H. pylori, were inactivated by insertion of the chloramphenicol
   acetyltransferase cassette into these individual genes. The isogenic
   mutants of H. pylori strain AH244 were obtained by natural
   transformation. Seventy-five ICR mice (15 mice/group) were
   orogastrically dosed with either the wild type H. pylori strain AH244,
   its isogenic mutants, or Brucella broth (negative control). Five mice
   from each group were killed at 2, 4 and 8 weeks post-inoculation (WPI),
   respectively. H. pylori colonization was not detected in mouse gastric
   mucosa infected with the frdA mutant at any time point in the study by
   both quantitative culture and PCR. In contrast, the mice inoculated with
   either wild type AH244, copA or copP H. pylori mutants became readily
   infected. These data indicate that FRD plays a crucial role in H. pylori
   survival in the gastric mucosa of mice. Given that FRD, present in all
   H. pylori strains, is immunogenic in H. pylori-infected patients and H.
   pylori growth in vitro can be inhibited by three anthelmintics
   (morantel, oxantel and thiabendazole), this enzyme could potentially be
   used both as a novel drug target as well as in the development of
   vaccines for H. pylori prevention and eradication. (C) 2000 Academic

Abstract = {{The design, construction, and use of a furnace from which time-resolved
   x-ray diffraction data may be measured from reacting mixtures of solids
   or of solids and liquids is described. The furnace is a vertical tube
   design, constructed from commercially available components, and can
   operate at temperatures of up to 1000 degreesC. The apparatus is
   designed to heat sample tubes of up to 3 cm diameter. The use of
   high-intensity synchrotron-generated white-beam x rays allows the tube
   and its contents to be penetrated; thus x-ray diffraction data can be
   measured from reactions taking place in laboratory-sized reaction
   vessels. The energy-dispersive diffraction geometry allows rapid data
   collection (of the order of seconds); hence reactions can be followed
   continuously in real time. The use of the furnace is demonstrated by
   results from experiments performed on Station 16.4 of the Daresbury
   Synchrotron Radiation Source, UK. Two distinct reaction types are
   studied, both used to prepare the layered perovskite RbCa2Nb3O10: first,

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Diabetes is a recognized risk factor for the development of
   cardiac disease, but its importance as a prognostic factor among
   patients with known cardiovascular disease is less clear. We evaluated
   survival in patients with and without diabetes who underwent cardiac
   catheterization for presumed coronary artery disease.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective cohort study
   that captures detailed clinical information and longitudinal outcomes
   for all patients who undergo cardiac catheterization in Alberta, Canada.
   We studied 11,468 patients, 1959 (17\%) of whom had diabetes. Logistic
   regression was used to model predictors of 1-year mortality, and
   proportional hazards analysis was used to model predictors of survival
   up to 3 years after cardiac catheterization.
   RESULTS: One-year mortality was 7.6\% for patients with diabetes versus
   4.1\% for those without diabetes (odds ratio = 1.9, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 1.6 to 2.3). After adjusting for other characteristics
   of the patients, including comorbid conditions, previous cardiac
   history, coronary anatomy, and renal function, the odds ratio for 1-year
   mortality was 1.1 (95\% CI: 0.8 to 1.3). Similarly, the adjusted hazard
   ratio for longer term mortality was 1.2 (95\% CI: 1.0 to 1.4, mean
   follow-up of 702 days).
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there is little or no
   independent association between diabetes and mortality for up to 3 years
   after cardiac catheterization. Estimates of short- to intermediate-term
   prognosis for diabetic patients with coronary artery disease should be
   based on the presence of other prognostic factors associated with
   diabetes. Am J Med. 2000; 109:543-548. (C) 2000 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between ocular perfusion pressure
   and color Doppler measurements in patients with glaucoma.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with primary open-angle glaucoma
   with visual field deterioration in spite of an intraocular pressure
   lowered below 21 mm Hg, 20 age-matched patients with glaucoma with
   stable visual fields, and 20 age-matched healthy controls were
   recruited. After a 20-minute rest in a supine position, intraocular
   pressure and color Doppler measurements parameters of the ophthalmic
   artery and the central retinal artery were obtained, Correlations be
   tween mean ocular perfusion pressure and color Doppler measurements
   parameters were determined.
   RESULTS: Patients with glaucoma showed a higher intraocular pressure (P
   < .0008) and a lower mean ocular perfusion pressure (P < .0045) compared
   with healthy subjects. Patients with deteriorating glaucoma showed a
   lower mean blood pressure (P = .033) and a lower end diastolic velocity
   in the central retinal artery (P = .0093) compared with normals, Mean
   ocular perfusion pressure correlated positively with end diastolic
   velocity in the ophthalmic artery (R = 0.66, P = .002) and central
   retinal artery (R = 0.74, P < .0001) and negatively viith resistivity
   index in the ophthalmic artery (R = -0.70, P = .001) and central retinal
   artery (R = -0.62, P = .003) in patients with deteriorating glaucoma.
   Such correlations did not occur in patients with glaucoma with stable
   visual fields or in normal subjects, The correlations were statistically
   significantly different between the study groups (parallelism of
   regression lines in an analysis of covariance model) for end diastolic

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The presence of steatosis is a common histological finding in
   patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The causes of the severity of
   this condition are not yet clear, although both metabolic and viral
   factors supposedly are involved. In this study our aim was to examine
   the possible influence that leptin levels, hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA
   levels, and hepatitis G virus (HGV) infection have on the severity of
   steatosis and on the presence and degree of fibrosis in patients with
   CHC.
   METHODS: One hundred eighty-two CHC patients with histological findings
   of steatosis were chosen from among a cohort of patients referred to our
   center for staging of liver disease. Among them 48 CHC patients were
   accurately selected so as to rule out possible confounding factors for
   the presence of steatosis (diabetes mellitus, hyperlipemia, obesity,
   alcohol). Leptin levels, HCV RNA levels, and HCV genotype, and the
   presence of HGV RNA were assessed in these patients and related to
   histological findings.
   RESULTS: We found that leptin levels in CHC patients were similar to
   those in healthy subjects. No relationship was found between leptin
   levels and severity of steatosis. HCV RNA levels, HCV genotype, and the
   presence of HGV infection were no different among CHC patients with
   various degrees of steatosis. Leptin was not related to different
   degrees of fibrosis, whereas higher viral load was the only parameter
   associated to higher fibrosis scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the degree of steatosis in
   patients with CHC does not seem to depend on serum leptin levels or on
   viral factors, at least as far as HCV viremia and genotype and HGV
   infection are concerned. The severity of fibrosis does not seem to be
   influenced by leptin levels, whereas HCV viral load does seem to play
   some role. (C) 2000 by Am. Cell. of Gastroenterology.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this paper is to describe women's opinions
   and policy preferences concerning domestic violence screening and
   mandatory reporting.
   Methods: This case-control study included 202 abused women and 240
   randomly selected nonabused women recruited from a large metropolitan
   health maintenance organization who were interviewed by telephone. Of
   these women, 46.6\% had a college degree, 53.4\% were white, and 60\%
   had a household income of \$50,000 or more.
   Results: Forty-eight percent of the sample agreed that health care
   providers should routinely screen all women, with abused women 1.5 times
   more likely than non-abused women to support this policy. For mandatory
   reporting, 48\% preferred that it be the woman's decision to report
   abuse to the police. Women thought it would be easier for abused women
   to get help with routine screening (86\%) and mandatory reporting
   (73\%), although concerns were raised about increased risk of abuse with
   both screening (43\%) and reporting (52\%) policies. Two thirds of the
   sample thought women would be less likely to tell their health care
   providers about abuse under a mandatory reporting policy. Interventions
   offered in managed care settings that would be well received, according
   to the women in this study, include counseling services, shelters, and
   confidential hotlines.
   Conclusions: Women expressed fears and concerns about negative
   consequences of routine screening and, even more so, for mandatory
   reporting. Domestic violence policies and protocols need to address the
   safety, autonomy, and confidentiality issues that concern women.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Extended cervical mediastinoscopy (ECM) is a technique in
   the staging of bronchogenic carcinoma described first by Ginsberg in
   1984. To update our experience we have prospectively evaluated our
   results on 106 patients who underwent the technique from 1985 to 1998.
   Methods. The ECM technique is performed once the operability of the
   patient has been evaluated, according to the computed tomography
   findings. The intervention is carried out at the same time as a standard
   cervical mediastinoscopy through the same incision following the same
   technique as previously published.
   The ECM is considered positive when metastatic nodes or tumor
   involvement directly in the paraaortic or subaortic regions is detected
   and confirmed histologically. Negative cases of ECM and positive cases
   of standard cervical mediastinoscopy are excluded from this study. A
   false-negative ECM is defined as the presence of infiltrated
   adenopathies at the paraortic level detected on postoperative histologic
   study.
   Results. We had performed ECM in 106 patients, and a total of 13 were
   subsequently excluded for the reasons stated above. Of the remaining
   cases, 26 were positive, 61 negative and 6 had false-negative results
   with no false-positive results. Sensitivity was 81.2\%, specificity
   100\%, accuracy 93.3\%, positive predictive value 100\%, and negative
   predictive value 91\%. There were no complications with the technique.
   Conclusions. We conclude that ECM is a useful technique for staging
   bronchogenic carcinoma that allows samples to be taken from paraortic
   and subaortic regions with minimally invasive techniques. (Ann Thorac

Abstract = {{A 16-kDa protein was isolated from Helianthus annuus flowers by its
   ability to inhibit the germination of fungal spores. This protein,
   SAP16, displays an associated activity of trypsin inhibitor and was
   further purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography on
   trypsin-agarose. SAP16 causes the complete inhibition of Sclerotinia
   sclerotiorum ascospores germination at a concentration of 5 mug.mL(-1)
   (0.31 muM) and a clear reduction of mycelial growth at lower
   concentrations, indicating a strong antifungal potency against this
   natural pathogen of sunflower. Our data suggest that the antifungal
   ability of SAP16 would not be the result of the inhibition of a fungal
   protease. This study contributes to the characterization of the emerging
   family of antifungal proteins with an associated activity of trypsin
   inhibition and emphasizes their role in plant resistance against fungal
   attack. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose the use of adaptive context-based prediction in
   a sequential mode for lossless audio compression. We show that lossless
   compression algorithms with sequential context-based prediction can
   achieve better compression results than with forward-frame-based linear
   prediction. The proposed coding scheme uses parametric modelling of
   errors in a large number of contexts in conjunction with Golomb-Rice
   encoding. Context quantization and prediction are similar to those
   introduced in an algorithm previously proposed for image compression
   (Tabus et al., Proceedings of ICIP'97 International Conference on Image
   Processing, Santa Barbara, California, October 1997, pp. 401-404) but
   new solutions are provided to cope with the wide dynamical range of the
   prediction error and, optionally, to exploit the long-time dependencies,
   very common in audio or speech signals. The experimental results show
   the good performance of the proposed technique for audio signals sampled
   at 48 kHz with 16 bits/sample while the variant including long-time
   prediction is shown to perform very well for speech signal sampled at 8
   kHz with 16 bits/sample. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{HIT-T15 cells, a clonal beta -cell line, were cultured and passaged
   weekly for 6 mo in RPMI 1640 media containing various concentrations of
   glucose. Insulin content decreased in the intermediate- and late-passage
   cells as a continuous rather than a threshold glucose concentration
   effect. In a second series of experiments, cells were grown in media
   containing either 0.8 or 16.0 mM glucose from passages 76 through 105.
   Subcultures of passages 86, 92, and 99 that had been grown in media
   containing 16.0 mM glucose were switched to media containing 0.8 mM
   glucose and also carried forward to passage 105. Dramatic increases in
   insulin content and secretion and insulin gene expression were observed
   when the switches were made at passages 86 and 92 but not when the
   switch was made at passage 99. These findings suggest that glucose
   toxicity of insulin-secreting cells is a continuous rather than a
   threshold function of glucose concentration and that the shorter the
   period of antecedent glucose toxicity, the more likely that full
   recovery of cell function will occur.}},

Abstract = {{In a search for cosmopolitan phylogenetic clusters of freshwater
   bacteria, we recovered a total of 190 full and partial 16S ribosomal DNA
   (rDNA) sequences from three different lakes (Lake Gossenkollesee,
   Austria; Lake Fuchskuhle, Germany; and Lake Baikal, Russia). The
   phylogenetic comparison with the currently available rDNA data set
   showed that our sequences fall into 16 clusters, which otherwise include
   bacterial rDNA sequences of primarily freshwater and soil, but not
   marine, origin. Six of the clusters were affiliated with the alpha, four
   were affiliated with the beta, and one was affiliated with the gamma
   subclass of the Proteobacteria; four were affiliated with the
   Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group; and one was affiliated with
   the class Actinobacteria (formerly known as the high-G+C gram-positive
   bacteria), The latter cluster (hgcI) is monophyletic and so far includes
   only sequences directly retrieved from aquatic environments.
   Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes specific for the
   hgcI cluster showed abundances of up to 1.7 x 10(5) cells ml(-1) in Lake
   Gossenkollesee, with strong seasonal fluctuations, and high abundances
   in the two other lakes investigated. Cell size measurements revealed
   that Actinobacteria in Lake Gossenkollesee can account for up to 63\% of
   the bacterioplankton biomass, A combination of phylogenetic analysis and
   FISH was used to reveal 16 globally distributed sequence clusters and to
   confirm the broad distribution, abundance, and high biomass of members
   of the class Actinobacteria in freshwater ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), aberrations in DNA copy
   number were studied before and after transformation of follicular
   lymphoma to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in six patients (15 lymph node
   biopsies in total). The most common and also the most discrete and
   intense amplification occurring in four out of 15 biopsies from three
   different patients was of 2p13-16. Using real-time quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR), REL amplification was found to be
   implicated at this locus. This technique also identified amplified REL
   in a further two biopsies, presumably below the detection level of CGH.
   REL amplification was quantified by comparing it, in most cases, with
   three endogenous reference genes, albumin, beta (2)-microglobulin and

Abstract = {{The experimental results of the present study show that the composition
   of the electrodeposited nickel-cobalt alloy in sulfamate electrolytes

   increase in the pH of the solution adjacent to the cathode is inhibited.
   Citrate anions form a wide variety of complexes with nicker and cobalt.
   Protonated citrate complexes of nickel(ll) and cobalt(II) are apt to be
   involved in the electrochemical alloying process. Acetate anions serve
   to buffer the sulfamate solutions. Nickel-cobalt electrochemical
   alloying leads to an increase in the reaction rate of cobalt at the
   expense of the nickel reaction rate. The data confirm that inhibition of
   the more noble metal by the less noble one does not depend on the anion
   composition of the electrolyte. (C) 2000 The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract = {{Two experiments were conducted to investigate the active components of
   soybean lecithin for juvenile Litopenaeus vannamei. The first experiment
   was conducted to determine the dietary phosphatidylcholine (PC)
   requirement of juvenile L. vannamei, and to investigate whether other
   phospholipids (PL), mainly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and
   phosphatidylinositol (PI) were the active fractions of soybean lecithin.
   Seven levels of PC (0\%, 0.35\%, 0.7\%, 1.4\%, 2.1\%, 2.8\%, 4.2\%)
   extracted from soybean lecithin (PC purity 93\%) were used to determine
   the PC requirement; also, PE and PI tin a 25:22 proportion) were tested
   at 0.84\% and 1.68\% levels with PC levels controlled at 0.35\% and
   0.52\% of diet to investigate the combined PE and PI effects. Results
   showed that no dietary PC requirement was evident based on shrimp growth
   and survival. Increasing purified PC in the diet decreased total lipid,
   free fatty acid and other PL levels in shrimp hepatopancreas (mid-gut
   gland) and increased PC level in shrimp muscle. However, other FL,
   mainly PE and PI, showed significant enhancing effects on shrimp growth
   when PC was provided at 0.35\% or 0.52\% of diet.
   Another 4 X 2 factorial experiment was concluded to reevaluate the
   requirement of shrimp for PC by including purified PC at 0\%, 0.7\%, 1.4
   \% and 2.8\% of diet with or without 0.1\% cholesterol in the diet. A
   diet containing 1.4\% PC provided by deoiled lecithin also was tested
   for comparison. Results showed no interaction between PC and cholesterol
   on shrimp growth, survival and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Compared
   with the apparent growth-enhancing effect of dietary cholesterol, the
   effect of purified PC was negligible. With PC at 1.4\% of diet, the
   presence of other PL from lecithin or 0.1\% cholesterol significantly
   enhanced shrimp growth and FCR.
   In summary, purified soybean PC showed different effects from deoiled
   lecithin on shrimp growth, lipid composition, and relationship with
   dietary cholesterol. Beneficial effects of soybean lecithin on growth of
   L. vannamei could be attributed to the presence of PL other than PC in
   the diet under the experimental conditions of this study. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Mice transgenic for the human MUC1 carcinoma-associated antigen
   (MUC1.Tg) are tolerant to immunization with MUC1 antigen. Recent
   studies, however, have demonstrated that immunization of MUC1.Tg mice
   with fusions of MUC1-positive tumour and dendritic cells (FC/MUC1)
   reverses MUC1 unresponsiveness and results in rejection of established
   MUC1-positive pulmonary metastases. Here we demonstrate that lymph node
   cells from MUC1.Tg mice immunized with the FC/MUC1 fusion cells
   proliferate in response to MUC1 antigen by a mechanism dependent on the
   function of CD4, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, B7-1,
   B7-2, CD28, CD40 and CD40 ligand. The findings demonstrate that
   stimulation of lymph node cells with MUC1 results in selection of
   MUC1-specific CD8(+) T cells. We show that the CD8(+) T cells exhibit
   MUC1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity by recognition of
   MUC1 peptides presented in the context of MHC class I molecules K-b and
   D-b. The MUC1-specific CD8(+) T cells also exhibit antitumour activity
   against MUC1-positive metastases, but with no apparent reactivity
   against normal tissues. These results indicate that immunization of
   MUC1.Tg mice with FC/MUC1 reverses immunological unresponsiveness to
   MUC1 by presentation of MUC1 peptides in the presence of costimulatory
   signals and generates MHC-restricted MUC1-specific CD8(+) T cells.}},

Abstract = {{Catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) activity was measured in flesh tissue of six
   apple cultivars (Malus domestica Borkh. cvs. Braeburn, Gala, Jonagold,
   McIntosh, Red Delicious, and Spartan). Activity of CAT was determined
   for fresh and frozen tissue of the same fruit. Freezing resulted in
   reductions of 50 to 90\% in CAT activity compared with the activity
   measured in crude extracts from fresh tissues. The rate of freezing had
   an impact on the level of reduction of CAT activity, with slower
   freezing procedures leading to greater losses in activity. Six additives
   to the extraction buffer were tested to evaluate their potential to
   reduce the inactivation of CAT from frozen tissue, but only EDTA and
   Tween 20 showed any benefit. However, EDTA and Tween 20 provided only
   partial recovery in CAT activity. In contrast, crude extracts prepared
   from fresh tissue showed no appreciable loss in CAT activity after
   frozen storage for two weeks at -80 degreesC. Gel electrophoresis and
   immunological analysis indicated that the loss in CAT activity from
   tissue freezing could be attributed to loss of both the tetrameric CAT
   enzyme structure and total CAT protein. The implications of using
   freezing to preserve apple tissue samples prior to catalase activity
   analysis is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The present study was designed to determine if low pulse
   oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) in post-menopausal women at high altitude was
   related to high serum testosterone/estradiol (T/E-2) ratio. Method:
   Studies were carried out in 191 women living in Cerro de Pasco, Peru
   (4340 m above sea level) and in 56 women living in Lima (150 m asl).
   Body weight, height, SpO(2), hematocrit, serum follicle stimulating
   hormone (FSH), T and E-2 levels were measured in all women. Body mass
   index (BMI), menopausal status and serum T/E-2 ratio were calculated
   from data. Result: At high altitude, the values of SpO(2), serum T, and
   serum E-2 were significantly lower in post-menopausal than in
   pre-menopausal women. Hematocrit, serum FSH levels, and serum T/E-2
   ratios were significantly higher in post-menopausal women. Serum T and
   E-2 levels, T/E-2 ratio, SpO(2), and hematocrit levels were not further
   changed with time after menopause. Women with SpO(2) < 85\% had lower
   serum E-2, a higher serum T/E-2 ratio, and higher hematocrit values than
   women with SpO(2) > 90\%. At high altitude, multiple regression analysis
   showed that low SpO(2) was related to menopausal status (-2.6 +/- 0.83;
   beta +/- S.E.; P < 0.002) and not to chronological age (-0.06 +/- 0.04;
   P: NS). Further analysis showed that low SpO(2) was related to high
   basal serum FSH levels and a high serum T/E-2 ratio in the presence of
   an interaction between FSK and T/E-2. Conclusion: Low values of SpO(2)
   in women at high altitude were related to a high T/E-2 ratio. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Anion-exchange I;PLC has been used to resolve the isoforms of glutamine
   synthetase (GS, EC 6.3.1.2) from Zea mays mesophyll (MC) and bundle
   sheath cells (BSC). Two different isoforms were detected in both types
   of photosynthetic cells. The predominantly active isoform was GSI (61\%)
   in MC and GS2 (67\%) in BSC. The relative contribution of GS1 and GS2 to
   the overall GS activity in BSC in maize here reported resembles the
   proportion described for most C3 plants. Differences among these
   isoforms in terms of their susceptibility to phosphinothricin (PPT), an
   analogue of glutamate and known inhibitor of GS, were found. The GS1
   isoenzyme from MC was the most sensitive form, being inhibited by 50\%
   at approximately 2.0 muM DL-PPT, whereas the GS2 from BSC presented the
   highest tolerance to the inhibitor (I-50 = 30 muM) The
   transferase-to-semibiosynthetic activity ratio for the MC isoforms,
   which was higher than the ratio for the BSC isoforms, and the
   differences shown by the isoforms in susceptibility to PPT predict
   important differences in the biochemical properties and regulation of GS
   isoenzymes. In this regard, the cytoplasmic isoenzymes, and especially
   the one in MC, due to its relatively high contribution to mesophyll cell
   GS activity, could play a vital role in nitrogen metabolism in maize.}},

   mg/kg/day CsA, and hypertension and renal insufficiency developed. In
   rats receiving CsA, the mRNA expression of pre-pro-endothelin-1
   increased, whereas that of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase
   decreased, both in the aorta and in the renal cortex (increases in
   pre-pro-endothelin-l mRNA in aorta and renal cortex, respectively: 275\%
   +/- 18\%, 300\% +/- 27\%; decreases in endothelial NO synthase mRNA in
   aorta and renal cortex respectively: 40\% +/- 8\%, 42\% +/- 6\%).
   Moreover, long-term CsA treatment also induced an up-regulation of the
   endothelin-converting enzyme 1 mRNA expression (156\% vs control rats)
   in the renal cortex, with a significantly increased protein content and
   enzyme activity. In contrast, no changes were detected in
   endothelin-converting enzyme 1 mRNA expression in aortas from rats
   receiving the drug. This imbalance between endothelin-1 and NO systems
   could explain the hypertension and the deranged kidney function observed
   after long-term CsA treatment in rats.}},

Abstract = {{Increased survival of C57BL/6 renal allografts following portal vein
   donor-specific pretransplant immunization of C3H mice is associated with
   increased expression of the molecule OX2 seen on host dendritic cells,
   along with a marked polarization in cytokine production from lymphocytes
   harvested from the transplanted animals, with preferential production of
   IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-beta on donor-specific restimulation in vitro, and
   decreased production of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha compared with
   non-portal vein-immunized control transplanted mice. The increased renal
   allograft survival and the altered cytokine production are abolished by
   infusion of anti-mouse 052 mAb (3B6), Infusion of a soluble OX2:Fc
   immunoadhesin can itself produce significant prolongation of xeno- and
   allografts in mice. We have used FITC-conjugated OX2:Fc to characterize
   cells expressing a ligand (OX2L) for OX2, and provide evidence that
   subpopulations of LPS-stimulated splenic macrophages, Con A-activated
   splenic T cells, and the majority (>80\%) of gamma delta TCR+ T cells
   express this ligand. We show below that F4/80(+), OX2L(+) splenic
   macrophages, admixed with OX2:Fc, represent a potent immunosuppressive
   population capable of causing more profound inhibition of alloreactivity
   in vitro or in vivo than that seen using either OX2:Fc or OX2(+) (or
   OX2L(+)) cells alone. Immunoregulation by this OX2L(+) population occurs
   in an MHC-restricted fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac tissue from autoimmune myocarditis mice was studied to evaluate
   the expression and biological activity of mRNA encoding H-1 receptor and

   sacrificed at 20, 45 and 50 days post immunization. Heart contractility
   studies and RT-PCR assays were performed. Heart from autoimmune
   myocarditis mice show mRNA iNOS-related dysfunction with a decrease in
   heart contractility. This effect was accompanied with an increase
   production of cyclic GMP and was improved by treating autoimmune mice
   with an inhibitor of iNOS activity. In addition, autoimmune myocardium
   expressed an active histamine H-1 receptor mRNA coupled to phospholipase
   C. The activation of H-1 receptor by ThEA stimulated both
   phosphoinositide hydrolysis and heart contractility. Normal myocardium
   did not expressed neither iNOS mRNA nor H-1 receptor mRNA. In
   conclusions: the development of autoimmune cardiac dysfunction was
   associated with the expression of iNOS mRNA, cyclic GMP accumulation and
   the expression of an active histamine H-1 receptor mRNA with increase
   production of inositol phosphates. These protein emergence during the
   course of autoimmune myocarditis may be involved a distinct compensatory
   mechanism operating in this disease. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland

Abstract = {{Abnormalities in glucose metabolism and insulin action are frequently
   detected in patients with essential hypertension. Spontaneously
   hypertensive rats (SHR) have been used as an experimental model to
   understand this pathological condition. The objective of the present
   study was to assess glucose metabolism and insulin action in SHR and
   Wistar rats under fed and fasting conditions. Peripheral glucose
   utilization was estimated by kinetic studies with {[}6-H-3]-glucose and
   gluconeogenetic activity was measured during continuous
   {[}C-14]-bicarbonate infusion. Plasma glucose levels were higher in the
   SHR group. Plasma insulin levels in the fed state were higher in the SHR
   group (99.8 +/- 6.5 muM) than in the control group (70.4 +/- 3.6 muM).
   Muscle glycogen content was reduced in SHR compared to control under the
   various experimental conditions. Peripheral glucose utilization was
   slightly lower in the SHR group in the fed state (8.72 +/- 0.55 vs 9.52
   +/- 0.80 mg kg(-1) min(-1) in controls). Serum free fatty acid levels,
   hepatic glycogen levels, hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
   activity and gluconeogenetic activity were similar in the two groups.
   The presence of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and the slightly
   reduced peripheral glucose utilization suggest the presence of
   resistance to the action of insulin in peripheral tissues of SHR.
   Hepatic gluconeogenesis does not seem to contribute to the metabolic
   alterations detected in these animals.}},

   in vitro and in vivo.
   Methods Pairs of isogenic E1 degrees and E1 degrees E4 degrees vectors
   were generated and compared. Levels of transgene expression were
   determined by Northern blot, ELISA and FAGS analysis. Initiation of
   transcription was studied by nuclear run-on assays.
   Results Similar to the viral CMV and RSV promoters, the activity of the
   ubiquitous cellular PGK promoter required the presence of the E4 genes
   in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, transgene expression from selected
   liver- and tumor-specific promoters did not require E4 functions.
   Conclusion Together with the reported low liver toxicity of E1 degrees
   E4 degrees vectors, the independence of E4 of liver-specific promoters
   renders such vectors interesting alternatives to the use of gutless
   vectors. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of six commercially available immunoassay systems for
   the detection of dengue virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG
   antibodies in serum was evaluated. These included two IgM and IgG enzyme
   immunoassays (EIA) from MRL Laboratories and PanBio, a rapid
   immunochromatographic test (RIT) from PanBio, immunofluorescence assays
   (IFA) from Progen, a dot blot assay from Genelabs, and a dipstick EIA
   from Integrated Diagnostics (INDX). For this study a panel of 132 serum
   samples, including 90 serum samples from patients with suspected dengue
   virus infection and 42 serum samples from patients with other viral
   infections, was used. In addition, serial serum samples from two monkeys
   experimentally immunized and challenged with degree virus type 2 were
   used. Results were considered conclusive when concordant results were
   obtained with four of the six antibody-specific assays. Based on this
   definition, the calculated overall agreement for the human serum samples
   for the respective IgM immunoassays was 97\% (128 of 132), with 34\% (45
   of 132) positive serum samples, 63\% (83 of 132) negative samples, and
   3\% of samples (4 of 132) showing discordant results. The calculated
   overall agreement for the IgG assays was 94\% (124 of 132), with 49\%
   (65 of 132) positive, 45\% (59 of 132) negative, and 6\% (8 of 132)
   discordant results, respectively. The sensitivities of the dengue
   virus-specific assays evaluated varied between 71 and 100\% for IgM and
   between 52 and 100\% for IgG, with specificities of 86 to 96\% and 81 to
   100\%, respectively. The relative sensitivities of the respective IgM
   assays measured with the monkey serum samples were comparable with those
   obtained with 12 serial serum samples from humans. Overall performance,
   based on the sum of the agreement, sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa
   statistics of the IgM and IgG immunoassays, showed that the antibody
   detection systems from INDX and Genelabs and the MRL and PanBio EIA are
   useful and reliable assays for dengue virus serodiagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{The generation schedules obtained in traditional hydrothermal scheduling
   or unit commitment programs are in hourly generation levels. In the new
   deregulated power market, the power transactions are processed in terms

   may result in penalty to power producers. This paper shows that although
   ramp-rate constraints are satisfied in hydrothermal scheduling, taking a
   generation level schedule as an energy delivery schedule may not be
   realizable. Based on the Maximum Principle in optimal control theory,
   the energy delivery capacity across the scheduling horizon is
   established as a set of recursive equations with given ramp-rate
   constraints. A sufficient and necessary condition is obtained to check
   if an energy delivery schedule is realizable. Based on this condition,
   two cases, where ramp-rate constraints are both satisfied, are analyzed
   and an unrealizable energy delivery schedule is observed.}},

   mice, contraction of carotid arteries in response to prostaglandin F-2
   alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) was impaired following TNF-alpha (100 mg/kg ip)( n
   = 10, P < 0.01). In contrast to responses in wild-type mice, contraction
   to low concentrations of PGF(2<alpha>) were normal, but maximum
   contraction to PGF(2 alpha) was impaired in arteries from iNOS -/- mice
   treated with TNF-alpha {[}0.35 +/- .0.02 g (n = 8) following vehicle and
   0.25 +/- 0.02 g (n = 7) following TNF-alpha (P < 0.05)]. Aminoguanidine,
   a relatively selective inhibitor of iNOS, partially restored contraction
   to PGF(2<alpha>) in vessels from iNOS +/+ mice but had no effect in iNOS
   -/- mice injected with TNF-alpha, suggesting that a mechanism(s) other
   than iNOS contributes to impaired responses. In contrast to contractile
   responses, relaxation of the carotid artery in response to acetylcholine
   and nitroprusside was not altered following TNF-alpha in iNOS +/+ or
   iNOS -/- mice. Responses of carotid arteries from iNOS -/- mice and
   effects of aminoguanidine suggest that both iNOS-dependent and
   iNOS-independent mechanisms contribute to impaired contractile responses

Abstract = {{The poverty-stricken mountain areas in South Central China face many
   challenges on the road to sustainable development in the 21st century.
   Great progress has been made in alleviating poverty in the past decade:
   while 15 million people in these areas suffered from extreme poverty in
   1989, this number decreased to about 6 million by 1996. Cereal
   production during the same period increased from 50 to 397 kg per
   capita. But to break away from poverty and raise the standard of living,
   the region must now enter a new stage of development. It needs to
   benefit from the transition taking place from a planned economy to a
   market economy, especially with respect to new domestic market
   conditions. There is also a need to raise awareness of the requirements
   for sustainable development strategies in mountain areas. This will
   involve industrialization of agriculture, increasing the quality of
   products in the primary and secondary sectors, developing the service
   sector, improving infrastructure for transport and trade, and letting
   the market determine resource use rather than vice versa. The following
   introduction to the region and its problems is complemented by
   recommendations for enhancement of economic strategies in the mountain
   areas shared by Chongqing Municipality and the provinces of Hubei,
   Hunan, and Guizhou and linked by the Yangtze and its tributaries.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of a commercial electroless Ni-P (EN) deposit known as
   Nimet's HP autocatalytic nickel(R), on the fatigue properties of a
   quenched and tempered SAE 4340 steel, has been investigated. Such an EN
   deposit had a thickness of approximately 10 mum, a P content of
   approximately 12 wt.\% and it was evaluated in two different conditions:
   (a) as-deposited; and (b) deposited and post-heat treated (PHT) at 723 K
   for 1 h, the condition in which the deposit showed its maximum hardness.
   It has been determined that the application of such a coating to the
   steel substrate gives rise to a significant reduction of the fatigue
   life and fatigue limit, in comparison with the uncoated material, which
   is more marked in the PHT condition. The reductions in fatigue life have
   been quantified in terms of the computed values of the Basquin
   parameters of the materials tested under different conditions. Thus, it
   has been shown that the fatigue life of the steel can be reduced up to
   93\% in the as-deposited condition and up to 97\% in the as-deposited
   and PHT condition. The fatigue limit can also be reduced between 12 and
   23\% depending upon the condition of the coating. From the microscopic
   point of view, it has been observed that the fatigue fracture of the
   substrate-coating composite initiates in the deposit and that it remains
   well adhered to the substrate during fatigue testing since interfacial
   cracks have been very rarely observed. Such adhesion characteristics
   enhance the transference of the early cracks nucleated towards the
   substrate steel, a belief that is supported by the analysis of the
   fracture surfaces of the samples tested at different stress levels. (C)

   the genesis of the individual and on the parallels between collective
   displacement and transformation processes in religious rites and the
   psychoanalytic process. Ritual and psychoanalysis follow the same

Abstract = {{Most coniferous trees are capable of photosynthesis throughout the year,
   but low temperatures and frozen soil limit winter photosynthesis in many
   regions. In eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.) in central
   Massachusetts, U.S.A., midday light saturated photosynthesis (P-max) in
   autumn was Limited by subfreezing temperatures during the previous one
   to two nights. In autumn, minimum air temperature (T-min) during the
   previous 24 h had a strong effect on midday P-max only if T-min was
   below -2 degreesC. P-max averaged about 5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) after T-min
   near -2 degreesC, but fell to about 1 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) after a T-min
   of -8 degreesC. Maximum measured P-max in winter was about 2.5 mu mol
   m(-2) s(-1) after a T-min of 7 degreesC in mid-March, and P-max in
   winter was more strongly related to average T-min during the previous
   week than to the T-min just prior to measurement. However, no major
   mid-winter thaws, with several successive above-freezing minimum
   temperatures, occurred during this study. A model of annual carbon
   exchange for the hemlock forest showed that daily ecosystem carbon
   exchange in December through March was very sensitive to variation
   between -5 and 2 degreesC in average daily T-min during the past 2 d.
   Fewer autumn frosts and prolonged winter thaws could increase annual
   photosynthesis and carbon storage in eastern hemlock forests in the
   northeastern United States.}},

Abstract = {{Historical reviews of the field of non-Mendelian genetics and many other
   publications credit Erwin Baur and Carl Correns equally for the
   development of the theory of plastid inheritance. However, a study of
   the original literature indicates that this conclusion is not correct.
   Analysis of the relevant articles leads to the conclusion that Baur
   alone deserves credit for the theory of plastid inheritance, In his
   classic article on the inheritance properties of white-margined
   Pelargonium plants, Baur (1909) stated: (1) The plastids are carriers of
   hereditary factors which are able to mutate. (2) In variegated plants,
   random sorting-out of plastids is taking place, (3) The genetic results
   indicate a biparental inheritance of plastids by egg cells and sperm
   cells in Pelargonium. By contrast, Correns held the view that in
   variegated plants there is a maternally transmitted labile state of the
   cytoplasm which switches either to a permanently ``healthy{''} state
   (allowing the ``indifferent{''} plastids to become green chloroplasts)
   or to a permanently ``diseased, ill{''} cytoplasmic state (causing white
   plastids and cells). Otto Renner supported Baur's theory and worked out
   important characteristics of plastid inheritance in the genus Oenothera.
   In the 1930s Renner reported many more observations, which established
   plastid inheritance as a widely accepted genetic theory.}},

   samples, which were prepared by thermal dealumination of USY zeolite and
   had equal unit cell parameter, showed that the mechanism of
   dealumination by thermal treatment varies with the presence of H2O in
   the atmosphere. The thermal treatment in an atmosphere containing H2O
   resulted in the formation of hydroxyl nests resulting from the removal
   of framework Al and replacement by Si from amorphous SiO2, and migration
   of the extra-framework Al to outer surface of the zeolite crystallites.
   And smaller crystallites were associated with a greater degree of
   dealumination. On the other hand, thermal treatment in an atmosphere not
   containing H2O resulted in smaller crystallites and more irregular
   arrangement of the supercages due to a greater increase in the hydroxyl
   nests. And it is suggested that cationic extra-framework Al generated by
   dealumination remain in the crystallites.}},

Abstract = {{Soil C sequestration in predicted, future elevated CO2 environments will
   be important to atmospheric CO2 levels, soil tilth, and fertility. An
   elevated CO2 study with ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa Laws) grown in
   chambers produced above ground vegetation with a delta C-13 of -44 parts
   per thousand and roots with -42 parts per thousand. This together with
   carbon dating made it possible to follow soil C dynamics. Fifty percent
   of the California upland soil C, resistant to acid hydrolysis, was
   designated as the resistant fraction. Carbon dating showed the mean
   residence times of this fraction to be 400 to 1500 yr greater than the
   total soil C for the horizons sampled. Young ponderosa pines grown in
   CO2 chambers produced negligible leaf litter. There were 32\% more roots
   in the presence of either added N or double CO2 but 77\% more in the
   presence of both. Root-derived soil C was equivalent to 10\% of the root
   C after the 6-yr growth period. Analysis of laboratory CO2 evolution
   during extended incubation showed the active soil C pool represented 1
   to 2\% of the soil C with a field-equivalent mean residence time (MRT)
   of 24 to 53 d. The slow pool represented 46 to 52\% of the C with MRT of
   24 to 67 yr depending on treatment and soil depth. Analysis of the
   (CO2)-C-13 label during incubation from the elevated CO2 treatments,
   showed the root-derived C-13 of the active fraction to have residence
   times similar to those of the total soil non labeled C at approximate to
   35 d. Root-derived C of the slow pool at 10 yr MRT turned over three to
   four time as fast as the general soil C. The C-13 of the light fraction
   (LF), showed it to be most closely associated with the active pool. The
   particulate organic matter (POM) was part of the slow pool as determined
   with incubation.}},

Abstract = {{Senescence-associated genes are up-regulated during plant senescence and
   many have been implicated in encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism
   of senescing tissues. Using the differential display technique, we
   identified a SAG in bean (Phascolus vulgaris) leaf that was exclusively
   expressed during senescence and was designated senescence-associated
   receptor-like kinase (SARK). The deduced SARK polypeptide consists of a
   signal peptide, a leucine-rich repeat in the extracellular region, a
   single membrane-spanning domain, and the characteristic serine/threonine
   protein kinase domain. The mRNA level for SARK increased prior to the
   loss of chlorophyll and the decrease of chlorophyll a/b-binding protein
   mRNA. Detached mature bean leaves, which senesce at an accelerated rate
   compared with leaves on intact plants, showed a similar temporal pattern
   of SARK message accumulation. Light and cytokinin, which delayed the
   initiation of leaf senescence, also delayed SARI; gene expression; in
   contrast, darkness and ethylene, which accelerated senescence, advanced
   the initial appearance of the SARK transcript. SARK protein accumulation
   exhibited a temporal pattern similar to that of its mRNA. A possible
   role for SARK in the regulation of leaf senescence was considered.}},

Volume = {{122}},

Abstract = {{Between December 1998 and January 1999 a specific, enzootic dermatitis
   was observed in a crossbreed sheep flock in Northern Hungary. The
   affected flock comprised 400 pregnant ewes and 65 (16.2\%) of them
   showed clinical signs during the course of the disease, In the first
   half of November 1998 these animals grazed on a maize stubble-field,
   where the left corn-stalks were 35-40 centimetres high. It was likely
   that these corn-stalks injured the skin of the head. Two weeks later the
   first clinical signs were observed.
   Clinico-pathological lesions were usually restricted to one side of the
   head and particularly affected the skin around the eye, over the nasal
   and maxillary bones. Skin lesions were erythematous, swollen and
   irregularly shaped ranging in diameter from 3-8 centimetres. Affected
   skin surfaces were covered by serofibrinous or serosanguinous exudate
   (Figure 1). In some cases the odour of the head was foul-smelling. The
   circumscribed lesions were covered by reddish-brown or brownish-black
   scabs and were surrounded by a zone of alopecia (Figure 2, 3)
   In treated ewes the skin lesions persisted for about five weeks and
   healed without scar formation. After local or parenteral antibiotic
   treatment the skin lesions healed within two weeks. Histologically the
   following tissue lesions were found: necrosis and desquamation of
   superficial layers of the epidermis, ulceration, serofibrinous exudate
   on the surface of the skin (Figure 4), Subepidermal layers of the skin
   were infiltrated by mononuclear cells and neutrophil granulocytes,
   haemorrhages and cluster of Gram-positive bacteria could also be seen
   (Figure 5).
   Bacteriological culture from the scabs of six affected ewes yielded
   coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus together with coagulase
   negative staphylococci and streptococci in three cases, while in the
   other cases arcanobacteria, streptococci and moraxellae grew in mixed
   culture. The coagulase positive S. aureus strains were identified and
   characterised by conventional tests (Table) and commercial kits (BBL
   Crystal, ApiStaph, Staphaurex). Ectoparasites and dermatopathogenic
   fungi could not be demonstrated. Blood sera of the six affected ewes
   were negative for the presence of virus antibodies, but were positive
   for pestivirus (BVD/BD) antibodies.
   The observed clinical signs and the results of bacteriological culture
   were very similar Co those reported by SCOTT and others in connection
   with the ``Staphylococcal dermatitis of sheep{''} (Vet. Rec., 1980. 107.
   452-454.) This disease has not been reported earlier in Hungary.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the impact of transportation, simulated under laboratory
   conditions, on the corneal endothelium preserved by Optisol-GS,
   Likorol-DX, Likorol, and MK-Medium, Methods. Three hundred twenty
   corneas from freshly slaughtered pigs were stored in Optisol-GS,
   Likorol-DX. Likorol, and MK-Medium for 1. 3, 6, or 10 days. After
   short-term preservation, the transportation was simulated on a
   laboratory shaker at 4 degreesC with an acceleration of 0-100 km/h in 16
   seconds for 5 hours. Mate corneas served as the control. Corneal
   endothelial cell density was determined at the time of dissection,
   directly before the experiment, and after subsequent organ culture.
   Results, A significant cell loss induced by transportation simulation
   was not observed in any experimental group. Preservation in MK-Medium
   starting at 3 days of short term preservation resulted in a significant
   cell loss. Storage for up to 6 days in Optisol-GS, Likorol-DX, and
   Likorol did not result in a significant decrease in cell density.
   Conclusion. Short-term preserved corneas can be routinely distributed
   without a reevaluation, if the tissue is preserved for a shorter time as
   recommended by the manufacturers.}},

Abstract = {{SYNOPSIS. Evolution has been integrated with embryology during two great
   periods: the latter half of the 19th C as evolutionary
   morphology/embryology, and the latter third of the 20th C as
   evolutionary developmental biology. My mandate was to use the
   contributions of three embryologists/morphologists : Francis (Frank)
   Balfour (1851-1882), Walter Garstang (1868-1949) and Gavin de Beer
   (1899-1972) to discuss the foundations of evolutionary embryology in the
   UK from 1870 (when ``every aspiring zoologist was an embryologist, and
   the one topic of professional conversation was evolution,{''} Bateson,
   1922, p. 56), through the 1920s ({''}ontogeny does not recapitulate
   phylogeny, it creates it,{''} Garstang, 1922, p. 81) to the 1970s
   ({''}homology of phenotypes does not imply similarity in genotypes,{''}
   de Beer, 1971, p. 15). Evolutionary embryology was driven by a
   comparative embryological approach that sought homology of adult
   structures in germ layers and ancestry in embryos, and sought to
   differentiate larval adaptations from retained ancestral characters. An
   initial emphasis on a phylogenetic mechanism (recapitulation) slowly
   gave way to more mechanistic approaches that included heterochrony and
   the integration of embryology with physiological genetics. Germ layers,
   homology, larval evolution, larval origins of the vertebrates,
   paedomorphosis and heterochrony underpinned the origins of evolutionary
   embryology, and so I discuss each of these topics.}},

Abstract = {{Avian duetting is a poorly understood phenomenon despite many hypotheses
   as to its function. Contrary to the recent view that duetting functions
   for mate guarding and is a result of conflict between the sexes,
   Australian magpie-larks, Grallina cyanoleuca, do not use duetting as a
   paternity guard. I used a playback experiment to investigate the role of
   antiphonal duetting in territorial defence and pair bond maintenance,
   two traditional hypotheses about the function of duetting. The
   experiment showed that, like many nonduetting species, magpie-larks
   recognize neighbours on the basis of song. It also provided evidence of
   functional differences between duetting and solo singing which indicate
   that temporal coordination of song between partners is used to maintain
   the territory and pair bond. Duets were more threatening territorial
   signals than solo songs: males initiated more vocalizations in response
   to playback of duets than playback of solos. Simulated intrusion also
   caused males and females to approach the speaker together and coordinate
   more of their vocalizations to form duets. Females did not engage in
   sex-specific territorial defence, responding equally strongly to
   playback of male and female song, and maintaining both territory and
   pair bond by attempting to exclude intruders of either sex. Males
   initiated more vocalizations in response to playback of male than female
   song, and their likelihood of duetting appeared to be related more to
   threats to the pair bond, in particular desertion by their partner. (C)

Abstract = {{Improved blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been
   shown to enhance survival from cardiac arrest, Chest compression with a
   circumferential pneumatic vest enhances blood flow, but the size,
   weight, and energy consumption of the inflation system limit its
   portability and, thereby, have made clinical studies difficult. The
   purpose of this investigation was to study an improved circumferential
   chest compression device that uses a constricting band that is
   pneumatically actuated. The constricting band applies its force to a
   hydraulic cushion that contacts the anterior and lateral aspects of the
   chest. The hydraulic cushion transfers the circumferential constriction
   to inward force. CPR was performed on subjects 5 mins after induction of
   ventricular fibrillation, with the hydraulic-pneumatic band system
   (HB-CPR), with a pneumatic vest system (PV-CPR), and with standard
   manual CPR (S-CPR), each done for 2 mins in randomized order. Aortic and
   right atrial pressures were measured with micromanometers. Coronary
   perfusion pressure was calculated as the mean difference between the
   aortic and right atrial pressures during the release phase of chest
   compression. Aortic pressure and coronary perfusion pressure with HB-CPR
   and PV-CPR were improved over S-CPR, and HB-CPR produced comparable
   pressures to those of PV-CPR, The system for performing HB-CPR, however,
   was substantially lighter (10 vs. 50 kg) and consumed less energy (300
   vs. 1000 watts) than that far PV-CPR, Thus, HB-CPR appears to produce a
   similar improvement in hemodynamics over S-CPR as PV-CPR but may be more
   portable than PV-CPR, Therefore, HS-CPR may allow larger scale testing
   of circumferential chest compression approaches.}},

Abstract = {{We previously used a genetic approach to identify a new class of
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe genes (chromosome loss when overexpressed: do
   genes) that, when present in elevated dosage, cause the loss of an
   otherwise stable cen1 linear minichromosome at high rates. Here we
   report the identities of two do genes; one encodes histone H3.3 and the
   other, designated clo2, encodes a novel protein with significant
   homology to fission yeast Swi6p, human and Drosophila HPI
   heterochromatin proteins, and other chrome domain-containing proteins.
   Members of this group have been shown to localize to heterochromatic
   DNA, including centromeres, and to play roles in chromatin formation and
   organization. The S. pombe Clo2 protein localizes to centromere DNA in
   vivo, and overexpression of clo2 leads to a dramatic increase in the
   rate of mitotic loss of an artificial chromosome. Clo2p is not essential
   for mitotic growth, however, even in cells that also lack Swi6p. Thus,
   fission yeast appears to utilize multiple, functionally redundant,
   HP1-related proteins for heterochromatin-associated activities at
   centromeres and perhaps elsewhere in the genome.}},

Abstract = {{This article is an analysis of a new type of leadership vision, the kind
   of vision that is becoming increasingly pervasive among leaders in the
   modern world. This vision appears to offer a new horizon, whereas, in
   fact it delivers to its target audience a finely tuned version of the
   already existing ambitions and aspirations of the target audience. The
   leader, with advisors, has examined the target audience and has used the
   results of extensive research and statistical methods concerning the
   group to form a picture of its members' lifestyles and values. On the
   basis of this information, the reader has built a ``vision.{''} The
   vision is intended to create an impression of a charismatic and
   transformational leader when, in fact, it is merely a response. The
   systemic, arithmetic, and statistical methods employed in this operation
   have led to the coining of the terms mathematical leader and

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate the feasibility and advantages of
   self-injection of a depot dose of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
   (LHRH) analogue in patients with prostate cancer.
   Patients and methods Twenty patients (mean age 70.9 years, range 53-85)
   with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer were recruited from
   urology clinics and, using a defined protocol, were taught to perform
   self-injection of a depot LHRH analogue (Prostap SR(R) or Prostap 3(R),
   leuprorelin acetate, Wyeth Laboratories, Berks, UK). Patients were then
   followed for 1 year.
   Results Of the 20 patients, 11 successfully learned to use
   self-injection and administered injections for the duration of the
   study. Ten of the patients chose self-injection and continued to
   self-inject after the end of this study.
   Conclusions This pilot study of 20 patients showed that it is feasible
   for a selected group of patients to be taught self-injection of an LHRH
   analogue, and that some patients prefer this mode of drug

Abstract = {{Seasonal rural to urban migration of young men is becoming an
   increasingly important part of the rural economy of the West African
   Sahel, yet little is known about how the short-term contact of men with

   sending areas. In northern Burkina Faso, Substantial variation in
   short-term migration rates of young Fulani men to cities provides an
   opportunity to explore interactions between migration and fertility in
   this area. The groups most involved in seasonal labour migration
   experience substantially lower fertility than non-migrating groups.
   Fertility differentials arise largely from higher rates of secondary
   sterility among migrating groups, probably caused by an increased
   incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. Such mechanisms as changes
   in attitudes and knowledge regarding birth control, and the undermining
   of traditional practices of marriage, breastfeeding, and sexual
   abstinence are far less important.}},

   preceded by global than local targets. Global and both-level target
   selections were indexed by two posterior negativities peaking at 130 and
   190 ms poststimulus, whereas local target selection was indexed by a
   broad occipitotemporal negativity. A late selection positivity was
   observed over the left occipitotemporal site for global targets but over

   levels in peripheral blood cells to assess the possibility of using
   hOGG1 mRNA as a biomarker in epidemiological studies. To evaluate the
   intra- and interindividual variation of hOGG1 mRNA levels in peripheral

   1.6-17.6 The intraindividual variation range was 1.8-6.4, Although the
   difference in the mRNA levels between the sampling dates was not
   significant (P = 0.73), a significant difference in mRNA levels was
   found between the subjects (P < 0.01), The subjects seemed to fall into

Abstract = {{Objective: To better understand whether poor social adjustment, a core
   characteristic of schizophrenic illness, may also be an indicator of
   vulnerability in young people who are at genetic risk for schizophrenia,
   but who do not have schizophrenia. Method: Between 1992 and 1996, 27
   Israeli adolescents with a schizophrenic parent, 29 adolescents with no
   mentally ill parent, and 30 adolescents with a parent having a
   nonschizophrenic mental disorder were assessed on multiple domains of
   social adjustment measured using the Social Adjustment Inventory for
   Children and Adolescents and the Youth Self-Report. Results: Young
   people with a schizophrenic parent showed poor peer engagement,
   particularly heterosexual engagement, and social problems characterized
   by immaturity and unpopularity with peers. These social adjustment
   difficulties in youths at risk for schizophrenia could not be attributed
   solely to the presence of early-onset mental disorders, although
   problems were greater in those with disorders in the schizophrenia
   spectrum. Young people whose parents had other disorders showed
   different patterns of social maladjustment characterized by difficult,
   conflictual relationships with peers and family Conclusion: Adolescents
   at risk for schizophrenia have social deficits that extend beyond
   early-onset psychopathology and that may reflect vulnerability to
   schizophrenic disorder.}},

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the inherent competitive nature of the DEA efficiency
   assessment process, some effort has been made to relate DEA models to
   game theory. Game theory is considered not only a more natural source of
   representing competitive situations, but also beneficial in revealing
   additional insights into practical efficiency analysis. Past studies are
   limited to connecting efficiency games to some particular versions of
   DEA models. The generalised DEA model considered in this study unifies
   various important DEA models and presents a basic formulation for the
   DEA family. By introducing a generalised convex cone constrained
   efficiency game model in assembling the generalised DEA model, a
   rigorous connection between game theory and the DEA family is
   established. We prove the existence of optimal strategies in the
   generalised efficiency game. We show the equivalence between game
   efficiency and DEA efficiency. We also provide convex programming models
   for determination of the optimal strategies of the proposed games, and
   show that the game efficiency unit corresponds to the non-dominated
   solution in its corresponding multi-objective programming problem. Our
   study largely extends the latest developments in this area. The
   significance of such an extension is for research and applications of
   both game theory and DEA.}},

Abstract = {{There has been considerable debate regarding the nutritional benefits of
   pollen and the propolis produced by bees, although most contributions
   have lacked scientific soundness. This paper describes the possible
   beneficial effect of their use in pharmacological products in cases of

   the digestive utilization of iron, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium,
   using control rats and rats with nutritional ferropenic anemia. The
   addition of these products to the diet produced a positive effect on
   weight gain; this fact could constitute a scientific basis for the
   application of pollen and propolis as fortifiers. They improve the
   digestive utilization of iron and the regeneration efficiency of
   hemoglobin, especially during recovery from an anemic syndrome. They
   also have a positive effect on phosphocalcic metabolism and maintain an
   appropiate level of magnesium metabolism. Furthermore, in iron-deficient
   rats, these natural products palliate, to a large extent, the adverse
   effects of iron deficiency on calcium and magnesium metabolism as a
   result of the improvement in the digestive utilization of these

Abstract = {{A number of cardiac interventional procedures are available for the
   treatment of angina, including percutaneous transluminal coronary
   angioplasty (PTCA), stent insertion and rotational atherectomy (RA).
   Variable degrees of myocardial cell injury during PTCA and stent
   insertion have been observed, based on rises in creatine kinase MB
   isoenzyme (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) 6 24h post-procedure. As
   there are many variations in technique within each procedure it would be
   helpful to be able to determine objectively the degree of myocardial
   damage in order to optimize technique. We measured CK-MB, cTnT and
   cardiac troponin I (cTnI) to ascertain which is the most sensitive
   marker for minor myocardial damage in this setting. Blood samples were
   taken both before and 6, 14 and 24h after the procedure in 109 patients
   (77 men) with angina, 42 of whom had unstable angina. Of the 109
   patients, 86 had a stent inserted (21 as a primary stent), nine had
   PTCA, eight had RA and six intracoronary brachytherapy. Using the
   manufacturers' recommended cut-offs - CK-MB 4 mug/L, cTnI and cTnT 0.1
   mug/L - five patients were excluded from further analysis as all three
   markers were raised pre-procedure. Post procedure all three markers were
   in agreement for 68 patients (44 all normal, 24 all raised). Overall,
   CK-MB was raised in 28 patients, cTnT in 38 and cTnI in 58. In 19
   patients CK-MB and cTnT were normal, but cTnI was raised (15 between
   0.11 and 0.30 mug/L). cTnI was the most sensitive indicator of minor
   myocardial damage, but at the recommended cut-off of 0.1 mug/L may be
   overly sensitive. We await the results of our follow-up study to
   determine the clinical implications of these small rises in cTnI.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 30 years, ecologists have demonstrated the importance of
   flow and temperature as primary variables in driving running water,
   riparian and floodplain ecosystems. As it is important to assess the
   size and timing of discharge variations in relation to those in
   temperature, a method is proposed that uses multivariate techniques to
   separately classify annual discharge and temperature regimes according
   to their `shape' and `magnitude', and which then combines the
   classifications. This paper: (i) describes a generally applicable
   method, (ii) tests the method by applying it to riparian systems on four
   British rivers using a 20-year record (1977-97) of flow and air
   temperature; (iii) proposes a hydroecological interpretation of the
   classification; (iv) considers the degree to which the methodology might
   provide information to support the design of ecologically acceptable
   flow regimes.
   `Regimes' are defined for discharge and air temperature using monthly
   mean data. The results of applying the classification procedure to four
   British rivers indicates that the `typical' regimes for each of the four
   catchments are composite features produced by a small number of clearly
   defined annual types that reflect interannual variability in
   hydroclimatological conditions. Annual discharge patterns are dominated
   by three `shape' classes (accounting for 94\% of the station years:
   class A, early (November) peak; class B, intermediate (December-January)
   peak; and class C, late (March) peak) and one `magnitude' class (70\% of
   the station years fall into class 3, intermediate), with two subordinate
   `magnitude' classes: low-flow years (18\%) and high flow years (12\%).
   For air temperature, annual patterns are classified evenly into three
   `shape' and four `magnitude' classes. It is argued that this variety of
   flow-temperature patterns is important for sustaining ecosystem
   integrity and for establishing benchmark flow regimes and associated
   frequencies to aid river management. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The use of a ventilation strategy with high positive end-expiratory
   pressure (PEEP) that is intended to recruit collapsed alveoli and to
   prevent recurrent collapse can reduce alveolar protein influx in
   experimental acute lung injury (ALI). This could affect the pulmonary
   response to treatment with surfactant, since plasma proteins inhibit
   surfactant function. We studied the effect of exogenous surfactant on
   lung mechanics after 4 h of mechanical ventilation with high or low
   PEEP. Twenty-two adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized,
   tracheotomized and submitted to pressure-controlled mechanical
   ventilation with 100\% oxygen. One group served as healthy controls
   (n=6). In the remaining animals acute lung injury was induced by
   repeated lung lavages to obtain a Pa-O2 < 13 kPa during ventilation with
   a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 26 cm H2O and a PEEP of 6 cm H2O.
   These animals were allocated randomly to ventilation with high PEEP
   (n=8; 100 breaths min(-1), I:E= 1:1, PIP 35 cm H2O, PEEP 18 cm H2O) Or
   to conventional mechanical ventilation (PIP 28 cm H2O, PEEP 8 cm H2O;
   n=8; ventilated control group). After 4 h of ventilation, all animals
   were given surfactant (120 mg kg(-1)) via the trachea and ventilation
   was continued for 15 min. At the end of the study, pressure-volume
   curves were constructed to measure total lung capacity at 35 cm H2O
   (TLC35) and maximal compliance (C-max) and bronchoalveolar lavage was
   then used to measure alveolar protein influx. After ravage, Pa-O2
   remained around 13 kPa in the ventilated control group and was >66 kPa
   in the high-PEEP group. After surfactant treatment, Pa-O2 increased to
   >53 kPa in both groups. In the ventilated control group alveolar protein
   influx was greater and TLC35 and C-max were lower than in the high-PEEP
   group. We conclude that the pulmonary response to exogenous surfactant
   after mechanical ventilation in experimental ALI is improved when a
   ventilation strategy with high PEEP is used.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate optical coherence tomography in allergy prone
   uveitis patients,
   METHODS: Thirty-four patients (43 eyes) with posterior uveitis (31 eyes)
   and intermediate uveitis (12 eyes) were evaluated by fluorescein
   angiography, indocyanine green angiography, and optical coherence
   tomography. Follow-up examinations used optical coherence tomography in
   allergy-prone patients,
   RESULTS: Optical coherence tomography identified epiretinal membranes,
   which were removed surgically (three eyes); persistent cystoid macular
   edema, which resolved with cytotoxic treatment (12 eyes); and
   juxtafoveolar veolar membranes, which were treated by diode laser (six
   eyes) and excision (two eyes).
   CONCLUSION: Optical coherence tomography may provide useful information
   on complications developing in uveitis patients, (C) 2000 by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: To present our experience performing percutaneous
   cholangioscopy in the management of 25 patients with biliary disease.
   Methods: During the last 3 years, 26 percutaneous cholangioscopies were
   performed in 25 patients with common bile duct disease (n = 16),
   intrahepatic ducts disease (n = 6), and gallbladder disease (n = 4). Our
   patient population group included seven with common bile duct stones,
   three with intrahepatic lithiasis, and eight with benign strictures (six
   iatrogenic and two postinflammatory). In four patients malignancy was to
   be excluded, in two the tumor extent was to be evaluated, whereas in one
   case the correct placement of a metallic stent needed to be controlled.
   A 9.9 Fr flexible endoscope URF-P (Olympus, 1.2 mm working channel,
   70-cm length) was used.
   Results: In total, percutaneous cholangioscopy answered 30 diagnostic
   questions, was technically helpful in 19 cases (performing lithotripsy
   or biopsy or guiding a wire), and of therapeutic help in 12 (performing
   stone retrieval). In 24 of 26 cases the therapeutic decision and the
   patient management changed because of the findings or because of the
   help of the method. In two cases biliary intervention failed to treat
   the cause of the disease. No major complication due to the use of the
   endoscopy was noted.
   Conclusions: Percutaneous cholangioscopy is a very useful tool in the
   management of patients with biliary disease. The method can help in
   diagnosis, in performing complex interventional procedures, and in
   making or changing therapeutic decisions.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to detecting capillary electrophoresis (CE) eluent
   components by interfacing CE with a surface-enhanced Raman scattering
   (SERS) system is described. In this approach, CE-based separation of a
   mixture of trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene and
   N,N-dimethyl-4-nitrosoaniline has been detected by SERS in a postcolumn
   Geometry. The retention time obtained from SERS corresponds well with
   that from conventional UV-visible detection. Meanwhile, CE eluants are
   identified by their characteristic vibrational spectra, demonstrating
   the validity of SERS as a structure-specific detection method for CE. In
   addition, the ability to monitor SERS intensity changes at
   molecule-specific frequencies makes selective detection of individual
   analytes possible, even when separation is incomplete. Finally, CE-SERS
   is evaluated for separation of amino acids (tyrosine and tryptophan) and
   environmental pollutants (chlorophenol mixtures).}},

Abstract = {{Inherited mutations in the gene BRCA2 predispose carriers to early onset
   breast cancer, but such mutations account for fewer than 2\% of all
   cases in East Anglia. It is likely that low penetrance alleles explain
   the greater part of inherited susceptibility to breast cancer;
   polymorphic variants in strongly predisposing genes, such as BRCA2, are
   candidates for this role. BRCA2 is thought to be involved in DNA double
   strand break-repair(1,2) Few mice in which Brca2 is truncated survive to
   birth; of those that do, most are male, smaller than their normal
   littermates and have high cancer incidence(3,4). Here we show that a
   common human polymorphism (N372H) in exon 10 of BRCA2 confers an
   increased risk of breast cancer: the HH homozygotes have a 1.31-fold
   (95\% Cl, 1.07-1.61) greater risk than the NN group. Moreover, in normal
   female controls of all ages there is a significant deficiency of
   homozygotes compared with that expected from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
   whereas in males there is an excess of homozygotes: the HH group has an
   estimated fitness of 0.82 in females and 1.38 in males. Therefore, this
   variant of BRCA2 appears also to affect fetal survival in a
   sex-dependent manner.}},

Abstract = {{Hemiclonal/hybridogenetic hybrids combine demographic superiority of
   asexuals and genetic diversity of sexuals, but their need for
   backcrossing with a parental species tightly couples them with this
   sexual host. Mow can systems like this persist in ecological and
   evolutionary time? Two discrete-time mathematical models describing the
   complex life cycle and mating system of hybridogenetic waterfrogs (Rana
   esculenta) identified four factors and their interactions as important.
   Although female mating preferences, in combination with differences in
   fecundity, determine species coexistence, differences in larval
   competitiveness seem to be more important for the hybrid's actual
   frequency. However, coexistence is possible even when host and hybrid
   are equally fecund and competitive. Dispersal and competition interact
   in their influence on species composition, but ecological and
   reproductive dispersal has opposing effects. In ecological terms our
   results explain the remarkable stability of observed species ratios over
   lime within natural hybridogenetic populations, and indicate why the
   species composition can vary so widely between localities. In
   evolutionary terms they explain the old age of these and other
   hybridogenetic systems. They also suggest interesting consequences for
   other tightly coupled systems.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Current guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education
   Program (NCEP) recommend initial dietary counseling by physicians for
   most patients with hypercholesterolemia; referral to a registered
   dietitian and lipid-lowering drugs are recommended only for patients who
   remain hypercholesterolemic. We evaluated the incremental value of
   detailed nutritional counseling by dietitians when added to general
   nutritional advice provided by physicians.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Hypercholesterolemic patients detected during a
   cholesterol screening project were randomly assigned to receive dietary
   counseling by a physician only (70 patients) or by a physician and a
   registered dietitian (66 patients). Patients were observed for 1 year to
   determine compliance with NCEP guidelines.
   RESULTS: At 3 months, the mean (+/- SD) decrease in the se rum
   low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was 7\% +/- 11\% in the
   physician group and 12\% +/- 10\% in the dietitian group (P <0.004). A
   decrease of 10\% or more in the LDL cholesterol level was seen in 25
   patients (36\%) in the physician group and 43 patients (65\%) in the
   dietitian group (P <0.001). Only 40 (29\%) of the patients in both
   groups achieved their NCEP target goals at 3 months. The majority of
   these were low-risk patients with an LDL cholesterol target goal of 160
   mg/dL. At 12 months, both groups lost about half of the beneficial
   effects on LDL cholesterol levels, and the difference between the two
   groups diminished.
   CONCLUSIONS: The short-term reduction in LDL cholesterol level, achieved
   after counseling by dietitians is superior to that achieved by
   physicians. However, long-term compliance remains inadequate. For
   patients at high risk, consideration should be given to a more
   aggressive dietary approach and possibly earlier introduction of
   lipid-lowering medications. Am J Med. 2000;109:549-555. (C) 2000 by

Abstract = {{This study compared the postprandial triacylglycerol (TACT) response to

   sprint/strength-trained men, 11 untrained men, 11 untrained women)
   consumed a meal (1.2 g fat, 1.1 g carbohydrate, 66 kJ per kg body mass)
   after a 12-h fast. Venous blood samples were obtained in the fasted
   state and at intervals until 6 h. Postprandial responses were the areas
   under the plasma or serum concentration-vs.-time curves. Neither fasting
   TAG concentrations nor the postprandial TAG response differed between
   trained and untrained subjects. The insulinemic response was 29\% lower
   in endurance-trained men than in untrained men {[}mean difference -37.4
   (95\% confidence interval -62.9 to -22.9) mu IU/ml x h, P = 0.01].
   Responses of plasma glucose, serum insulin, and plasma nonesterified
   fatty acids were all lower for endurance-trained men than for untrained
   men. These findings suggest that, in young adults, no effect of training
   on postprandial lipemia can be detected after 60 h without exercise. The
   effect on postprandial insulinemia may persist for longer.}},

Abstract = {{To describe the impact of a history of diabetes mellitus on the
   improvement of symptoms and various aspects of quality of life (QoL)
   during 5 years after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients
   who underwent CABG between 1988 and 1991 in western Sweden were
   approached with an inquiry prior to surgery and 5 years after the
   operation. QoL was estimated with three different instruments: Physical
   Activity Score (PAS), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) and Psychological
   General Well-Being (PGWB) index. 876 patients participated in the
   evaluation, of whom 87 (10\%) had a history of diabetes. Symptoms of
   dyspnea and chest pain improved both in diabetic and non-diabetic
   patients. Diabetic patients scored worse than non-diabetic patients both
   prior to and 5 years after CABG, but without ally major difference in
   improvement;between the two groups with all three measures of QoL. PAS
   tended to improve mole in non-diabetic than in diabetic patients,
   whereas improvement in NHP and PGWB was similar regardless of a history
   of diabetes. Diabetic patients differ from non-diabetic patients having
   an inferior QoL both prior to and 5 years after CABG. Both diabetic and
   non-diabetic patients improve in symptoms and QoL after the operation.
   In some aspects improvement tended to be less marked in the diabetic
   patients but on the whole improvement was similar compared to
   nan-diabetic patients. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the results of the application of conventional
   and photocatalytic methods for the treatment of hazardous laboratory
   wastes. Liquid wastes from the spectrophotometric determination of NH4+
   as indophenol have been chosen as model samples. The waste composition
   is rather heterogeneous, as phenol, ethanol, nitroprusside and citrate
   can be found, among others. High organic carbon contents (thousands of
   ppm) are found, part of which is volatile organic carbon (VOC) up to
   68\%.
   Three different photocatalytic methods have been tested:
   TiO2-photocatalysis, photoFenton reaction and the combination of H2O2-UV
   light. The degradation process was monitored by Total Organic Carbon
   (TOC) reduction. The effect of experimental parameters, such as pH and
   TiO2, H2O2 and Fe2+ concentrations, has been investigated. The strongest
   TOC reduction was achieved employing the photoFenton reaction with 2.5
   mM Fe2+ and 8 mM H2O2 The effect of solar TiO2-photocatalysis and the
   photoFenton reaction was also studied. TOC reductions of 76.6 and 46.8\%
   were achieved by the photoFenton reaction and TiO2-photocatalysis,
   respectively.
   The mineralization of individual components of the samples:
   nitroprusside, phenol and citrate (1000 ppm of C) was also attempted by
   KMnO4 and the three photomethods. Nitroprusside was the most resistant
   component to be mineralized. PhotoFenton and the combination of H2O2-UV
   light gave the best results for nitroprusside degradation.
   Due to the high TOC content of the samples, an oxidative pretreatment
   with KMnO4 before the photocatalytic treatment was also investigated.
   KMnO4 pretreatment gave reductions of initial TOC as high as 90\% and
   VOC reductions From 30 to 77\%. The remaining solution must be treated
   with KMnO4 if the photocatalytic methods are to be applied later. If the
   sample is not previously treated with KMnO4, not one of the photomethods
   tested is able to reduce the remaining non-purgeable (NPOC) organic
   carbon of the sample. This suggests that KMnO4 oxidizes the organic
   pollutants to other organics compounds that can be more readily
   mineralized by photodegradation.
   The recommended method for the treatment of these wastes consists of a
   pretreatment with KMnO4, followed by the photocatalytic treatment by
   means of photoFenton reaction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{After many years with little progress in new treatments for patients
   with inflammatory bowel disease, there is now rapid expansion of a new
   class of immunologic agents. These agents are designed to disrupt
   proinflammatory pathways at specific sites,
   Monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are
   already transforming the lives of some patients with previously
   intractable Crohn disease, and further TNF-alpha directed therapies are
   being developed. Clinical trials are now underway on agents that inhibit
   adhesion molecules and antiinflammatory cytokines, while attempts are

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a nonparametric Granger-causality test for
   covariance stationary linear processes under, possibly, the presence of

   against contiguous alternatives converging to the parametric rate T-1/2.
   Since the test is based on estimates of the parameters of the
   representation of a VAR model as a, possibly, two-sided infinite
   distributed lag model, we first show that a modification of Hannan's
   (1963, 1967) estimator is root-ir consistent and asymptotically normal
   for the coefficients of such a representation. When the data are
   long-range dependent, this method of estimation becomes more attractive
   than least squares, since the latter can be neither root-ir consistent
   nor asymptotically normal as is the case with short-range dependent
   data.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of air-breathing marine predators to forage successfully
   depends on their ability to remain submerged. This is in turn related to
   their total O-2 stores and the rate at which these stores are used up
   while submerged. Body size was positively related to dive duration in a
   sample of 34 adult female southern elephant seals from Macquarie Island.
   However, there was no relationship between body size and dive depth.
   This indicates that smaller seals, with smaller total O-2 stores, make
   shorter dives than larger individuals but operate at similar depths,
   resulting in less time being spent at depth. Nine adult female elephant
   seals were also equipped with velocity time depth recorders. In eight of
   these seals, a plot of swimming speed against dive duration revealed a
   cloud of points with a clear upper boundary. This boundary could be
   described using regression analysis and gave a significant negative
   relationship in most cases. These results indicate that metabolic rate
   varies with activity levels, as indicated by swimming speed, and that
   there are quantifiable limits to the distance that a seal can travel on
   a dive of a given swimming speed. However, the seals rarely dive to
   these physiological limits, and the majority of their dives are well
   within their aerobic capacity. Elephant seals therefore appear to dive
   in a way that ensures that they have a reserve of O-2 available.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature rises in the human eye for plane wave exposures are
   investigated in the frequency range between 600 MHz and 6 GHz, which
   covers the hot spot frequency range. As a first step, the specific
   absorption rates (SARs) are calculated with the use of the
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method and the mechanism of
   hot-spot formation is discussed. Then the temperature rises in the human
   eve are calculated by using Pennes' bioheat equation. In addition, the
   dependence of SARs and temperature rises on the electromagnetic (EM)
   wave polarization and the eye dimension is discussed. Furthermore, the
   temperature rises calculated are compared with the values found in the
   literature pertaining to microwave-induced cataract formation. Numerical
   results show that hot spots appear in a certain frequency range and that
   the location and number of hot spots depend on the frequencies of the
   incident wave. In particular, the averaged SARs and the temperature rise
   are found to depend obviously on the polarization of the EM wave.
   Additionally, the deviations in the SAR and the temperature rise caused
   by the eye size are found to be within 10\%. Furthermore. the maximum
   temperature rise due to the incident EM power density of 5.0 mW/cm(2),
   which is the maximum permissible exposure limit for controlled
   environments, is found to be 0.30 degreesC at 6.0 GHz. This value is
   small but not negligible, as compared with the threshold temperature
   rise 3.0 degreesC for cataract formation.}},

   competence. Cross-sectional analyses indicated that depressive symptoms

Abstract = {{When a bright white disk revolves around a fixation point on a gray

   spokes: The illusion occurs when a disk moves across the retina even
   though it is perceived to be stationary, but the illusion does not occur
   when the disk appears to move while remaining stationary on the retina.
   A second experiment shows that the strength of the illusion decreases
   with decreasing luminance contrast until subjective equiluminance, where
   little or no spoke is perceived. These results suggest that spokes
   originate at an early predominantly luminance-based stage of motion
   processing, before the visual system discounts retinal motion caused by

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging is a robust technique
   for evaluation of a variety of neurologic diseases affecting the brain,
   and might also have applications In the spinal cord. The purpose of this
   study was to determine the feasibility of obtaining in vivo
   diffusion-weighted images of the human spinal cord, to calculate normal
   apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, and to assess cord
   anisotropy.
   METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers were imaged using a multi-shot,
   navigator-corrected, spin-echo, echo-planar pulse sequence. Axial images
   of the cervical spinal cord were obtained with diffusion gradients
   applied along three orthogonal axes (6 b values each), and ADC values
   were calculated for white and gray matter.
   RESULTS: With the diffusion gradients perpendicular to the orientation
   of the white matter tracts, spinal cord white matter was hyperintense to
   central gray matter at all b values. This was also the case at low b
   values with the diffusion gradients parallel to the white matter tracts;
   however, at higher b values, the relative signal intensity of gray and
   white matter reversed. With the diffusion gradients perpendicular to
   spinal cord, mean ADC values ranged from 0.40 to 0.57 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s
   for white and gray matter. With the diffusion gradients parallel to the
   white matter tracts, calculated ADC values were significantly higher.
   There was a statistically significant difference between the ADCs of
   white versus gray matter with all three gradient directions. Strong
   diffusional anisotropy was observed in spinal cord white matter.
   CONCLUSION: Small field-of-view diffusion-weighted images of the human
   spinal cord can be acquired in vivo with reasonable scan times.
   Diffusion within spinal cord white matter is highly anisotropic.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to determine if ethylene influences chilling
   injury, as measured by percentage of slices exhibiting water-soaked
   areas in fresh-cut tomato slices of `Mountain Pride' and `Sunbeam'
   tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Ethylene concentration in
   containers without ventilation significantly increased during storage at
   5 degreesC, whereas little or no accumulation of ethylene occurred in
   containers with one or six perforations, Chilling injury was greatest
   for slices in containers with six perforations, compared to slices in
   containers with one perforation, and was over 13-fold greater than that
   of slices in control containers with no perforations. An experiment was
   also performed to investigate the effectiveness of including an ethylene
   absorbent pad in containers on subsequent ethylene accumulation and
   chilling injury. While ethylene in the no-pad controls increased
   continually during storage of both `Mountain Pride' and `Sunbeam'
   tomatoes at 5 degreesC under modified atmosphere conditions, no increase
   in accumulation of ethylene was observed in containers containing
   ethylene absorbent pads throughout storage. The ethylene absorbent pad
   treatment resulted in a significantly higher percentage of chilling
   injury compared with the no-pad control. In studies aimed at inhibiting
   ethylene production using AVC during storage of slices, the
   concentration of ethylene in control containers (no AVG) remained at
   elevated levels throughout storage, compared to containers with slices
   treated with AVG, Chilling injury in slices treated with AVG was 5-fold
   greater than that of controls, Further, we tested the effect of ethylene
   pretreatment of slices on subsequent slice shelf life and quality. In
   slices treated with ethylene (0, 0.1, 1, or 10 muL(.)L(-1)) immediately
   after slicing, ethylene production in nontreated controls was greater
   than that of all other ethylene pretreatments. However, pretreatment of
   slices 3 days after slicing resulted in a different pattern of ethylene
   production during storage. The rate of ethylene production by slices
   treated with 1 muL(.)L(-1) ethylene 3 days after slicing was greater
   during storage than any of the other ethylene treatments. With slices
   pretreated with ethylene, bath immediately and 3 days after slicing, the
   rate of ethylene production tended to show a negative correlation with
   chilling injury. Chemical name used: 1-aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG).}},

Abstract = {{A 512 x 512 monolithic platinum silicide focal plane array with random
   line selection was proposed. The device was modified from an interline
   transfer charge couple device configuration by adapting a random line
   selected charge accumulation structure on a vertical register and
   four-tap readout structure on a horizontal register to achieve a high
   fill factor, high charge handling capacity, and high frame rate
   operation. An on-chip 9-bit decoder was used to select a particular line
   to transfer charges to their associated vertical charge coupled device
   (CCD) register. Accompanied with the vertical reset drain circuitry,
   1-512 lines can be selected and read out by the vertical CCD registers.
   The dummy charges on the unselected lines are then transferred to the
   vertical CCD channel and dumped to the vertical reset drain. In this
   unique readout structure, a frame rate of upto 240 frames/s can be
   obtained to select 128 x 128 of Schottky barrier detectors for 5 MHz
   clock frequency operation. By changing the selection pattern on a 9-bit
   decoder, the device can be operated in either interlaced or
   non-interlaced format, and the charge integration time can be varied
   which results in variable exposure control. This architecture not only
   maintains the advantages of CCD structure for its low noise and
   excellent signal to noise ratio, but also provides readout capability of
   any portion of the array like MOS structure does. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of malignancies uses light to activate a
   photosensitizer preferentially accumulated in cancer cells. The first
   pegylated photosensitizer, tetrakis-(m-methoxypolyethylene glycol)
   derivative of
   7,8-dihydro-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3-hydroxyphenyl)-21-23-{[}H]-porphyrin
   (PEG-m-THPC), was evaluated in non-tumor-bearing rats. The aim of this
   study was to assess the photodynamic threshold for damage and its
   sequelae in normal rat tissue. Thirty-five Fischer rats were sensitized
   with 3, 9 or 30 mg/kg body weight PEG-m-THPC, Colon, vagina and perineum
   were irradiated with laser light of 652 nm wavelength and an optical
   dose of 50, 150 or 450 J/cm fiber length. Temperature in the pelvis was
   measured during PDT, Three days following PDT the effect on skin,
   vagina, colon, striated muscle, connective tissue, nerves and blood
   vessels was assessed by histology, The healing of the above-mentioned
   tissues was assessed on two rats 3 and 8 weeks after PDT using 9 mg/kg
   PEG-m-THPC activated with 450 J/cm laser light, No dark toxicity was
   observed. PDT using 30 mg/kg PEG-m-THPC induced severe necrosis
   irrespective of the optical dose, Body weight of 9 or 3 mg/kg activated
   with less than 450 J/cm induced moderate or no damage. No substantial
   increase in body temperature was seen during PDT, Tissues with severe
   PDT-induced damage seem to have a good tendency to regenerate. We
   conclude that within the dose required for tumor treatment PEG-m-THPC is
   a safe photosensitizer with promising properties. PDT of the colon
   mucosa below 9 mg/kg PEG-m-THPC and 150 J/cm seems to be safe. All other
   tissues can be exposed to 9 mg/kg PEG-m-THPC activated with less than
   450 J/cm laser light with little side effects.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between drink driving behaviours and rates of traffic
   accidents was analysed in a birth cohort of 907 New Zealand young people
   studied to the age of 21. Drink driving was significantly (P < 0.0001)
   related to active traffic accidents in which the driver's behaviour
   contributed to the accident but was not related to passive accidents in
   which driver behaviours did not contribute to the accident (P > 0.15).
   Those engaging in high rates of drink driving had rates of active
   traffic accidents that were 2.6 times higher than those who did not
   drink and drive. Further analysis suggested that much of this
   association was explained by confounding factors (and notably driver
   behaviour) that were associated with both drink driving and accident
   rates. After adjustment for confounding factors, those engaging in high
   rates of drink driving had rates of active accidents that were 1.5 (P <
   0.01) times higher than those who did not drink and drive. It is
   concluded that although the study findings support the view that the
   regulation of drink driving behaviour amongst young people is likely to
   contribute to a reduction in traffic accidents, to be fully effective
   attempts at regulation of drink driving also need to be accompanied by a
   similar level of investment in regulating other aspects of risky or
   illegal driving behaviour amongst young people. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Intraductal papillary-mucinous carcinoma (IPMC) of the
   pancreas is a newly identified clinicopathologic entity of the exocrine
   pancreas. It has been considered a slowly growing and less-aggressive
   carcinoma with a favorable prognosis. There have been only a few
   documents reporting its distant metastasis and cytologic features, with
   no report of thyroid metastasis until the present.
   CASE: A case of IPMC occurred in a 45-year-old male, who was admitted
   with rapid growth and tenderness of the thyroid. Abdominal computed
   tomography showed the typical cystic dilatation of IPMC with adjacent
   organ metastasis. Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid yielded
   papillary fronds of carcinoma cells with nuclear pleomorphism, abundant
   cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli in a mucinous background.
   Immunohistochemical findings from the skin and thyroid characterized the
   papillary-mucinous carcinoma as having originated in the pancreas.
   CONCLUSION:This case suggests that papillary carcinoma fronds aspirated
   from the thyroid should be further differentiated from the primary site
   and that a pleomorphic nucleus in a mucinous background is a useful
   feature to exclude a thyroid origin. Before this, distant metastasis of
   IPMC to the skin and thyroid has not been reported. The prognosis of
   IPMC with wide, distant metastasis at an advanced stage is poor.}},

Abstract = {{Structural characterization of phosphatidylinositol (PI),
   phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate CPI-LP), and
   phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P-2) by collisionally
   activated dissociation (CAD) tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray
   ionization is described. In negative ion mode, the major fragmentation
   pathways under low energy CAD for PI arise from neutral loss of free
   fatty acid substituents ({[}M - H - RxCO2H](-)) and neutral loss of the
   corresponding ketenes ({[}M - H - R-x'CH=C=O](-)), followed by
   consecutive loss of the inositol head group. The intensities of the ions
   arising from neutral loss of the sn-2 substutient as a free fatty acid
   ({[}M - H - R2CO2H](-)) or as a ketene ({[}M - H - R-2'CH=C=O](-)) are
   greater than those of ions reflecting corresponding losses of the sn-l
   substutient. This is consistent with our recent finding that ions
   reflecting those losses arise from charge-driven processes that occur
   preferentially at the sn-2 position. These features permit assignment of
   the position of the fatty acid substituents on the glycerol backbone.
   Nucleophilic attack of the anionic phosphate onto the C-l or the C-2 of
   the glycerol to which the fatty acids attached expels sn-l (R1CO2-) or
   sn-2 (R2CO2-) carboxylate anion, respectively. This pathway is
   sterically more favorable at sn-2 than at sn-l. However, further
   dissociations of {[}M - H - RxCO2H - inositol](-), {[}M - H - RxCO2H](-)
   and {[}M - H - R-x'CH=C=O](-) precursor ions also yield RxCO2- ions,
   whose abundance are affected by the collision energy applied. Therefore,
   relative intensities of the RxCO2- ions in the spectrum do not reflect
   their positions on the glycerol backbone and determination of their
   regiospecificities based on their ion intensities is not reliable. The
   spectra also contain specific ions at m/z 315, 279, 259, 241, and 223,
   reflecting the Inositol head group. The last three ions are also
   observed in the tandem spectra of the {[}M - H](-) ions of
   phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PI-P) and phosphatidylinositol
   bisphosphate (PI-P-2), in addition to the ions at mit 321 and 303,
   reflecting the doubly phosphorylated inositol ions. The PI-P-2 also
   contains unique ions at m/z 401 and 383 that reflect the triply
   phosphorylated inositol ions. The {[}M - H](-) ions of PI-P and PI-P-2
   undergo fragmentation pathways similar to that of PI upon CAD. However,
   the doubly charged ({[}M - 2H](2-)) molecular ions undergo fragmentation
   pathways that are typical of the {[}M - H] ions of
   glycerophosphoethanolamine, which are basic. These results suggest that
   the further deprotonated gaseous {[}M - 2H](2-) ions of PI-P and PI-P-2
   are basic precursors. (C) 2000 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.}},

Abstract = {{Rice is a staple diet in Asia, where the incidence of breast and colon
   cancer is markedly below that in the Western world. We investigated
   potential colon and breast tumor-suppressive properties of rice, testing
   the hypothesis that rice contains phenols that interfere with the
   proliferation or colony-forming ability of breast or colon cells. Brown
   rice, its white milled counterpart, and bran from brown rice were boiled
   and extracted with ethyl acetate, The extracts were analyzed by high
   pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, Eight phenols,
   protocatechnic acid, g-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid,
   sinapic acid, vanillic acid, methoxycinnamic acid, and tricin, were
   identified in the extracts of bran and intact brown rice. These extracts
   were separated into nine fractions by column chromatography, The effect
   of bran extract and its fractions at 100 mug/ml on cell viability and
   colony-forming ability of human-derived breast and colon cell lines was
   assessed. Bran extract decreased numbers of viable MDA MB 468 and HBL
   100 breast cells and colon-derived SW 480 and human colonic epithelial
   cells as judged by the
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl
   )-2H-tetrazolium assay. It also reduced colony formation of SW 480 colon
   and MDA MB 468 breast cells. Of the eight phenols identified in the
   brown rice bran, when applied at 50 muM, caffeic acid decreased numbers
   of all cell types except HBL 100, Tricin, ferulic acid, and
   methoxycinnamic acid interfered with cell viability in one or more cell
   lines. Tricin (50 muM) and the other phenols (200 muM) inhibited colony
   formation of SW 480 cells. Clonogenicity of MDA MB 468 cells was
   inhibited by caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and tricin (50 muM). Tricin was
   the most potent anticlonogenic of the compounds with IC(50)s of 16 muM
   in the SW 480 colon cells and 0.6 muM in the MDA MB 468 breast cells.
   The results suggest that: (a) brown rice and bran contain compounds with
   putative cancer chemopreventive properties; (b) certain phenols
   contained in brown rice bran, e,g,, tricin, may be associated with this
   activity; and (c) these phenols are present at much lower levels in
   white than in brown rice. Thus, the consumption of rice bran or brown
   rice instead of milled white rice may be advantageous with respect to
   cancer prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Space-time coding and modulation exploit the presence of multiple
   transmit antennas to improve performance on multipath radio channels.
   Thus far, most work on space-time coding has assumed that perfect
   channel estimates are available at the receiver. In certain situations,
   however, it may be difficult or costly to estimate the channel
   accurately, in which case it is natural to consider the design of
   modulation techniques that ao not require channel estimates at the
   transmitter or receiver.
   We propose a general approach to differential modulation for multiple
   transmit antennas based on group codes. This approach can be applied to
   any number of transmit and receive antennas, and any signal
   constellation, We also derive low-complexity differential receivers,
   error bounds, and modulator design criteria, which we use to construct
   optimal differential modulation schemes for two transmit antennas. These
   schemes can be demodulated,vith or without channel estimates. This
   permits the receiver to exploit channel:estimates when they are
   available. Performance degrades by approximately 3 dB when estimates are
   not available.}},

Abstract = {{Today's increasing connectivity between separate entities within an

   departmental computing and propose a: new framework that can expand its
   potentials. When we view departmental computing from a distributed group

   not only corporate data but also decision models should be an integral
   part of managerial decision making. In this paper, we present a
   framework for collaborative model management systems (MMS), which
   coordinates the changes made to shared decision models in the modelbase
   so that the net effect of the changes can be systematically propagated
   across multiple departments by automatically updating the model views.
   Details of the proposed model change propagation mechanism are discussed

   Methods. We studied skeletons of Jomonese of the period 5000-2300 years

Abstract = {{Eradication of Helicobacter pylori from the gastric and duodenal mucosa
   is an important clinical goal in the treatment of infected patients with
   peptic ulcer disease and other H pylori-associated conditions. Although
   several oral drug combination regimens ate associated with eradication
   rates of approximately 85\% in controlled trials, the success rate in
   patients infected with a resistant strain of H pylori is closer to 75\%.
   Resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin, which are common
   components of combination treatment regimens, is of greatest concern.
   Reported rates of H pylori resistance to various antibiotics vary
   considerably. In Canada, the data documenting H pylori susceptibility
   are limited but suggest that resistance to these antibiotics varies
   geographically and within specific treatment groups. Although
   susceptibility testing is not a prerequisite for initial treatment of
   individual patients infected with H pylori, formal efforts to identify
   and monitor both the causes and prevalence of antibiotic resistance
   across Canada are a much needed step in the ongoing management of this
   important infection. Recommended treatment regimens may be useful, even
   for treating apparently resistant H pylori strains. However, it is
   important to understand the mechanisms of the development of resistant
   strains to manage patients with treatment failure better.}},

Abstract = {{We have attributed organ engraftment to clonal exhaustion-deletion of
   host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host reactions that are reciprocally
   induced and governed by migratory donor and recipient leukocytes. The
   so-called donor passenger leukocytes that migrate from the allograft
   into the recipients have been thoroughly studied (chimerism), but not
   the donor leukocytes that remain in, or return to, the transplanted
   organ. Therefore, using flow cytometry we determined the percentage and
   lineages of donor leukocytes in cell suspensions prepared from Lewis
   (LEW) cardiac allografts to 100 days posttransplantation. The LEW hearts
   were transplanted to naive untreated Brown Norway (BN) recipients (group
   2), to naive BN recipients treated with a 28-day or continuous course of
   tacrolimus (TAC) (groups 3 and 4), and to drug-free BN recipients
   petolerized by earlier bone marrow cell (BMC) or orthotopic LEW liver
   transplantation (groups 5 and 6). The findings in the heart cell
   suspensions were correlated with the results from parallel
   histopathologic-immunocytochemical studies and other studies of the
   grafts and of host tissues. Although the LEW heart allografts were
   rejected in 9.6 days by the unmodified recipients of group 2, all beat
   for 100 days in the recipients of groups 3 through 6. Nevertheless, all
   of the long-surviving cardiac allografts (but not the isografts in group
   I) were the targets of an immune reaction at 5 days, reflected by
   dramatic increases in the ratio of leukocytes to nonleukocyte nucleated
   cells from normal values of 1:5-1:6 to 1:1-5:1 and by manifold other
   evidence of a major inflammatory event. The acute changes returned to
   baseline by 100 days in the chronic rejection (CR) free hearts of groups
   4 and 6, but not in the CR-afflicted hearts of short-course TAC group 3
   or the less-severely damaged hearts of the BMC-prime group 5. The
   freedom from CR in groups 4 and 6 was associated with a large donor
   contribution to the intracardiac leukocyte population at 5 days (28.6\%
   and 22\% in the respective groups) and at 100 clays (30.5\% in group 4
   and 8.4\% in group 6) compared with 2\% and 1.2\% at 100 days in the
   CR-blighted allografts of the partially tolerant animals of groups 3 and
   5. Whether large or small, the donor leukocyte fraction always included
   a subset of class II leukocytes that had histopathologic features of
   dendritic cells. These class II+ cells were of mixed myeloid
   (CD11b/c(+)) and lymphoid lineages; their migration was markedly
   inhibited by TAC and accelerated by donor-specific priming and TAC
   discontinuance. Although a large donor leukocyte population and a normal
   leukocyte/nonleukocyte cell ratio were associated with freedom from CR,
   these findings and the lineage profile of the intracardiac leukocytes
   were not associated with tolerance in the animals of groups 3 and 4
   under active TAC treatment. The findings in this study, singly and in
   their entirety, are compatible with our previously proposed leukocyte
   migration-localization paradigm of organ allograft acceptance and
   tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological development of larvae and juveniles of laboratory-reared
   yellow croaker Nibea albiflora are described from a series of specimens
   sampled daily, Details on the early developmental stages are
   illustrated, with special reference to morphological transformations and
   the developments of digestive tract, fins and scales.
   Artificially fertilized eggs were 836.5 +/- 38.2 mum in mean diameter.
   Hatching occurred by 24-26 h after the fertilization at water
   temperatures of 18.2-21.1 degreesC. On the 3 rd day after hatching,
   larvae completed yolk absorption and started feeding rotifers at 2.70
   +/-0.08 mm in body length (BL). Notochord flexion started on the 19 th
   day at 5.30 +/-0.33 nun BL. Transformation from the larval to the
   juvenile stage occurred between 7.6 and 12.0 mm BL. Then all fin rays
   attained the adult complement. Squamation completed at 8.9-11.8 mm BL,
   and rudimentary pyloric caeca appeared when the larvae transformed into
   juveniles. Between 12.6 and 14.9 mm BL, juveniles completed the
   formation of adult-like digestive system. Three marked changes appeared
   in the relative growth at approximately 5-7 mm, 10-14 mm and 40-50 mm
   BL. These morphological changes were closely related to the notochord
   flexion and two important changes, i.e. the beginning and ending of the
   juvenile stage.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a Monte Carlo simulation of the ground state
   and magnetic relaxation of a model of a thin film consisting of a
   two-dimensional square lattice of Heisenberg spins with perpendicular
   anisotropy It, exchange J and long-range dipolar interactions g. We have
   studied the ground state configurations of this system for a wide range
   of the interaction parameters Jig, K/g by means of the simulated
   annealing procedure, showing that the model is able to reproduce the
   different magnetic configurations found in real samples. We have found
   the existence of a certain range of K/g, Jig values for which in-plane
   and out-of-plane configurations are quasi-degenerated in energy. We show
   that when a system in this region of parameters is perturbed by an
   external force that is subsequently removed, different kinds of ordering
   may be induced depending on the followed procedure. In particular,
   simulations of relaxations from saturation under an AC demagnetizing
   field or in zero field are in qualitative agreement with recent
   experiments on epitaxial and granular alloy thin films, which show a
   wide variety of magnetic patterns depending on their magnetic history.

Abstract = {{Pacing algorithms for prevention of atrial tachyarrhythmia (AT) are
   under clinical evaluation. The present study prospectively evaluated the
   efficacy of three simultaneously active algorithms for AT prevention and
   aimed at identifying patients in whom atrial preventive pacing (APP) may
   be particularly successful. Methods: In 31 patients with conventional
   pacing indications and paroxysmal AT, a DDDRP pacing system was
   implanted, which stores 35 AT episodes with atrial electrograms and
   marker annotations. Counters and stored AT episodes were retrieved 30
   days after implant. APP algorithms (atrial preference pacing, atrial
   rate stabilization, postmode switching overdrive) were activated.
   Counters and stored AT episodes were again retrieved 60 days later. The
   number and duration of AT episodes was measured. Several clinical
   variables were examined with respect to their ability to identify
   candidates for APP. Results: During APP, the mean number of AT
   episodes/patient/day decreased from 7.67 to 1.68 (P = 0.04). However,
   time in AT was not significantly reduced (9.45\% versus 10.41\%). APP
   decreased the number of episodes/day in 11 patients and increased it in
   9 patients. No clinical parameters predicting APP success was
   identified. Conclusions: APP using three algorithms significantly
   reduced the mean number of AT episodes/patient/day. However, the time
   during which patients were in AT was not reduced. No clinical variable
   predicted the success or failure of APP.}},

Title = {{Validity of cadmium concentration in rice as the ``dose{''} of the

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that cadmium (Cd) causes renal dysfunction such as
   increase of beta (2)-microglobulin excretion into urine. Although Cd in
   rice seems to be one of the largest sources of total Cd intake in Japan,
   there are very few studies that have epidemiologically clarified the
   relationship between Cd concentration in rice (Cd-R) and renal
   dysfunction, because such studies are basically ecological studies, in
   which confounding factors are difficult to take into consideration. To
   derive safety levels for foodstuff from Cd-R, it is essential to
   evaluate the effect of confounding factors. Thus, we investigated the
   dose-response relationship between renal dysfunction and not only Cd-R
   but also confounding factors, and we tried to determine whether Cd-R is
   an adequate indicator of ``dose{''} in the dose-response relationship
   between Cd intake and renal dysfunction. In 1971, Cd-R data were
   obtained from rice samples collected by the Environment Agency,
   Government of Japan in the Fuchu area of Toyama Prefecture, which is
   known as a place where many itai-itai disease patients were found, and
   medical data were collected during 1979-1984 by Toyama Prefecture.
   First, the dose-response relationship between Cd-R and renal dysfunction
   was analyzed using the data from the Fuchu area. Second, to investigate
   the effect of confounding factors, analysis using the data from both the
   Fuchu area and an unpolluted area with environmental factors different
   from those of the Fuchu area was performed. The results showed that the
   cause of renal dysfunction could not be explained by Cd-R alone, and
   difficult to clarify precisely the confounding factors from the
   available data, it is concluded that deriving a safety level for
   foodstuffs using only the Cd-R level as a reference is not appropriate,

Abstract = {{A method is described for determining petroleum fuel contamination in
   water based on solid-phase microextraction and Raman spectroscopy
   (SPME/Raman). In this method, contaminants are extracted from aqueous
   solutions into a solid phase and then detected directly by using
   spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. The solid phase consists of a small
   volume (similar to 20 muL) of poly(dimethylsiloxane) that has an optical
   window in the 830-1600 cm(-1) Raman shift region. This region is
   suitable for determining both aromatic and aliphatic fuel components.
   Four ``real world{''} fuels-aviation gasoline, unleaded gasoline, jet
   fuel A, and \#1 fuel oil-were used to test this new method. As shown,
   the SPME/Raman determinations performed in the,visible spectral region
   were not adversely affected from the fluorescence of the marker dyes in
   these fuels. The linear dynamic ranges for the determinations exceeded
   the water solubility limits and spanned 1-3 orders of magnitude. The
   limits of detection with the use of the most sensitive Raman bands In
   each fuel were in the 8-12 ppm range with the exception of \#1 fuel oil
   (25 ppm), and relative standard deviations typically were 2-10\%.
   Finally, the SPME/Raman method was applied to the determination of total
   petroleum hydrocarbons in natural water matrices. With the use of hexane
   and undecane as standards, the results of the determinations compared
   favorably to the standard methods of purge-and-trap gas chromatography
   and liquid-liquid extraction followed by infrared detection.}},

Abstract = {{Glucosyltransferases of oral streptococci, dextransucrases and
   alternansucrase of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, collectively referred to
   as glucansucrases, are large extracellular enzymes that synthesise
   glucans with a variety of structures and properties. A characteristic of
   all these glucansucrases is the possession of a C-terminal domain
   consisting of a series of tandem amino acid repeats. These repeat units
   are thought to interact with glucan but closely resemble the cell wall
   binding domain motif found in choline binding proteins in Streptococcus
   pneumoniae and surface-located proteins in a range of other bacteria.
   Analysis of dextransucrase and alternansucrase sequences has now shown
   that they also contain these repeat motifs in the N-terminal region,
   raising questions about their evolutionary origin and functional
   importance. (C) 2000 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

   PS120 fibroblasts. NHE3 is a membrane transport protein that is acutely
   regulated by changes in the number of molecules expressed at the PM. To
   quantitate the PM expression of NHE3 under various experimental
   conditions, we stably expressed a chimera of rabbit NHE3 and green
   fluorescent protein (NHE3-GFP) in PS120 fibroblasts. A three-dimensional
   (3D) map of the intracellular distribution of NHE3-GFP was obtained by
   confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) of cells superfused with a
   styryl dye, FM 4-64. This fluorophore rapidly and reversibly labeled the
   outer lipid layer of the PM, which allowed generation of a digital mask
   of the PM and calculation of the fraction of a total cellular NHE3-GFP
   expressed at the PM. This analysis was successfully used to quantitate
   the relative PM expression of NHE3-GFP in control cells (25\%) and a
   decrease in the expression caused by subsequent exposure of cells to
   wortmannin (5.1\%). Reliability of the method was confirmed by cell
   surface biotinylation, which yielded very similar results. Confocal
   morphometric analysis is fast and reproducible and could potentially be
   used for investigations on regulation of expression of other membrane
   proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Spiral-wound gaskets (SWG) are used extensively as primary seals in
   critical joint applications of plant process piping systems in all
   industries, including petrochemical, paper and electricity generation.
   Despite widespread use and a long performance history, industry
   continues to experience significant operations and maintenance cost
   expenditures, conservatively estimated by some at more than 250 million
   US dollars per year, that are directly attributable to plant piping
   system leakage, of which SWG leaks appear to play a significant role.
   Recent works performed by the authors, in the area of improved plant
   leakage reduction techniques, strongly suggests that clearly definable
   gasket design, manufacturing and assembly factors are responsible. This
   work has also identified very effective preventive actions that have
   been proven experimentally, and in the field, to dramatically reduce
   incidents of piping system leakage caused by assembly failures in SWG
   joints. This paper discusses those generic issues effecting gasket
   performance, identifies those actions proven to mitigate leakage
   incidents, and offers suggestions for plant operators to generally
   improve their existing plant leakage reduction programs. (C) 2001 EPRI.

Abstract = {{The discovery of numerous biochemical effects of cyanide not directly
   related to the inhibition of the respiratory chain, including the
   involvement of apoptosis, has challenged the basis of traditional
   antidote treatment, which primarily depends on nitrite-induced
   conversion of hemoglobin into methemoglobin, releasing the blockade of
   cytochrome c oxidase by high-affinity binding of cyanide as
   cyanmethemoglobin. The fact that amyl nitrite has antidotal effects not
   related to methemoglobin formation has unfolded new mechanism of actions
   of nitrites including release of nitric oxide (NO). In this study, we
   characterized the effect of various NO donor compounds on
   cyanide-induced cell death in cultured chick embryonic neurons.
   Apoptosis was induced by treating the neuronal cultures with 1 mM NaCN
   for 1 h, followed by a cyanide-free incubation period of 23 h. Using
   this treatment protocol, we showed that cyanide-induced apoptosis was
   blocked in the presence of the different NO donors sodium nitroprusside,
   S-nitrosoglutathione, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamin, nitroglycerin,
   3-morpholinosydnonimine, and diethylamine nitric oxide, indicating
   independence of the redox-related species of NO released. The effect was
   confirmed to be mediated by NO, since exhausted NO donors did not afford
   protection, and the mechanism likely involved chemical modification of
   thiol groups, since the effect was completely reversed by
   dithiothreitol. Furthermore, NMDA antagonists protected against
   cyanide-induced cell death, whereas inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase
   increased cyanide-induced apoptotic damage, indicating a protective
   effect of endogenously generated NO, at least in cell cultures.}},

Abstract = {{The primary goal of research in `'quantum chaos'' is to explore the
   extent to which the methods and natural intuition of,classical mechanics
   can be used to elucidate the complex and often surprising behavior of
   large quantum systems. Much recent work is based on the deep connections
   between classical periodic (or closed) orbits and the quantum spectrum
   revealed by semiclassical ``trace formulas.{''} These ideas have;
   important applications in the analysis of the `'recurrence spectrum'' of
   Rydbeg atoms in strong static electric fields in which the measured
   peaks are associated with individual classical periodic orbits. Here we
   present detailed experimental measurements of the recurrence spectrum
   for n = 15-25, singlet and triplet, m = 0, 1, helium Rydberg atoms and
   we provide a purely quantum-mechanical explanation for the structure of
   the recurrence spectrum based on the regularities of the Stark
   photoabsorption spectrum. This analysis Serves to demystify these (still
   complex) representations of the quantum spectrum; provides new insight
   into the functional differences between hydrogen and helium Rydberg
   atoms in strong fields; and reemphasizes the remarkable correpondence
   between the classical and quantum theory for these systems.}},

Abstract = {{An assessment of three offshore platforms in the Valhall field of the
   North Sea is described in this paper. Ultimate strength and reliability
   analyses were performed for the jacket-type platforms for four levels of
   sea floor subsidence. The nonlinear structural models of the platform
   elements, joints, and associated soil-structure interaction are
   summarized in a companion paper by Gebara et al., 2000, ``Assessment of
   Offshore Platforms Under Subsidence-Part I: Approach.'' ASME J. Offshore

   Platforms, `` OMAE98, Lisbon, Portugal, and Stahl et al., 1998,
   Acceptance Criteria for Offshore Platforms, `` OMAE98, Lisbon, Portugal,
   respectively. This paper describes the procedures employed and results
   obtained for ultimate strength and reliability analysis. Ultimate
   platform strength was calculated using a pushover analysis in which
   environmental loads for increasingly rare events were applied
   incrementally until the platform failed. Failure was defined as
   formation of a limiting mechanism in the platform structure or
   foundation. Structural reliability analysis was performed to estimate
   the annual probability of platform failure as a function of subsidence
   level. The platform structural system was modeled in terms of two major
   subsystems that were assessed as likely to fail: (i) the platform deck,
   and (ii) the platform jacket and piles. Uncertainties were included in
   the loads structural components and soil strengths based on industry
   experience and data. First and second-order reliability methods
   (FORM/SORM) were used to estimate the annual failure probabilities.
   Consideration was given to the correlated nature of the failure modes
   due to the common environmental loads. The reliability results were
   compared with predefined acceptance criteria to judge the suitability of
   continued operations.}},

Abstract = {{Background There is a need for solid evidence of the relative advantages
   of universal vs. selective screening for gestational diabetes mellitus.
   Our study of a broad obstetric population determines the positive
   predictive value of the 50-g oral glucose challenge test for screening
   in the presence and absence of classical gestational diabetes risk
   factors.
   Methods. A retrospective cohort study was carried out with a total of
   2,574 pregnant women. Clinical information was obtained from hospital
   records and each patient's medical history, and gestational diabetes
   risk factors were quantified for each pregnant woman. The positive
   predictive value of a screen was determined with respect to the number
   of risk factors.
   Results. Age 30 or over, family history of diabetes, obesity (BMI
   greater than or equal to 27) and previous fetal macrosomia were
   established as the most frequent risk factors. Just over half (54.2\%)
   of our population presented one or more risk factors. Screening covered
   75\% of the population, and was positive in 15\% of the cases. Diagnosis
   was confirmed in 64 cases, 57 of them at risk, and seven with no risk
   Factors. We obtained an overall positive predictive value of 21.8\% (CI
   17.3-27.0). This figure increases with the number of risk factors, from
   12\% for the women with no risk factors, to 40\% for those presenting
   three or more risk factors.
   Conclusions. A selective screening program that takes into account the
   clinical background and characteristics of each pregnant woman allows a
   high yield of true positives while reducing the possible undesirable
   effects associated with false positives.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Chronic alveolar hypoxia is the major cause of pulmonary hypertension.
   The cellular mechanisms involved in hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial
   remodeling are still poorly understood. Mitogen-activated protein kinase
   (MAPK) is a key enzyme in the signaling pathway leading to cellular
   growth and proliferation. The purpose of this investigation was to
   determine the roles that MAPKs, specifically jun-N-terminal kinase
   (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), and p38
   kinase, play in the hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial remodeling. Rats
   were exposed to normobaric hypoxia (10\% O-2) for 1, 3, 7, or 14 d.
   Hypoxia caused significant remodeling in the pulmonary artery
   characterized by thickening of pulmonary arterial wall and increases in
   tissue mass and total RNA. JNK, ERK, and p38 kinase tyrosine
   phosphorylations and their activities were significantly increased by
   hypoxia. JNK activation peaked at Day 1 and ERK/p38 kinase activation
   peaked after 7 d of hypoxia. The results from immunohistochemistry show
   that hypoxia increased phospho-MAPK staining in both large and small
   intrapulmonary arteries. Hypoxia also upregulated vascular endothelial
   growth factor messenger RNA (mRNA) and platelet-derived growth factor
   receptor mRNA levels in pulmonary artery with a time course correlated
   to the activation of ERK and p38 kinase. The gene expressions of c-jun,
   c-fos, and egr-1, known as downstream effecters of MARK, were also
   investigated. Hypoxia upregulated egr-1 mRNA but downregulated c-jun and
   c-fos mRNAs. These data suggest that hypoxia-induced activation of JNK
   is an early response to hypoxic stress and that activation of ERK and
   p38 kinase appears to be associated with hypoxia-induced pulmonary
   arterial remodeling.}},

Number = {{1-2}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a relaxed self-consistent model is developed to calculate
   the evolution of martensite plates in the constituent grains and the
   overall behavior of the polycrystalline shape-memory alloy (SMA) films.
   This relaxed model was developed based on the observation that, for a
   thin film whose thickness direction contains only a few grains, the
   geometrical constraint in this direction is lost and consequently the
   non-vanishing components of the internal stress exist only in the plane
   directions. Such an internal stress distribution is used to calculate
   the martensitic volume concentration of the individual grains at the
   considered temperature, and then by means of an averaging process the
   overall properties of the polycrystal SMA film. Several important
   characteristics are uncovered based on this relaxed constraint; they
   show that the properties of thin films can be distinctly different from
   those of the bulks. Most notable among these under a thermally-induced
   phase transformation is a narrower range of transformation temperatures
   for the films. Under a mechanical loading the stress-strain behavior of
   the films are found to exhibit a lower `work-hardening' characteristic
   than the bulks due to the relaxed geometrical constraint. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Background Skin diseases can greatly affect the quality of life (QoL).
   Little is known, however, of their impact on QoL in the developing
   world. This study was designed to assess the effect of skin diseases in
   such a setting.
   Methods A questionnaire survey of patients using the Dermatology Life
   Quality Index (DLQI), modified to the cultural needs of the population.
   The adapted instrument was translated into Afrikaans and Xhosa. Six
   hundred and seven patients attending general dermatology clinics at
   Groote Schuur Hospital and 53 controls were recruited. Influences on QoL
   of clinical severity, employment, education, age, sex, and home language
   were examined.
   Results Participants included 313 (52\%) English-speaking, 215 (35\%)
   Afrikaans-speaking, and 79 (13\%) Xhosa-speaking dermatology patients.
   Independent risk factors for having a high disability score were
   dermatologists' assessment of severity, younger age, unemployment, and
   language (odds ratio, 0.13; 95\% confidence interval (CI) of 0.03-0.5
   for Xhosa speakers compared to Afrikaans speakers). Gender was not
   associated with a high score, but females were more likely to report
   effects of skin disease on self-esteem, clothing choice, treatment
   problems, and anxiety.
   Conclusions In this multicultural setting, social class and language
   group, but not gender, influenced the impact of skin disease on overall
   QoL. Xhosa speakers were apparently less affected than other patients.
   This could be due to cultural differences in the experience of skin
   disease and in the perception of disability, or to biases in
   questionnaire responses. Anxiety and depression were relevant dimensions
   of QoL in this study and should be considered for inclusion in future
   research. The adapted and translated DLQI was valid and reliable.}},

Abstract = {{Oestrogen and progesterone have been shown to have impact on cystic
   fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene expression,
   tone of smooth muscle in the airways, immune response, exhaled nitric
   oxide and cytology in the tracheobronchial epithelium. The aim of this
   investigation was to study the influence of menstrual cyclicity on
   airway symptoms among cystic fibrosis (CF) females.
   Twelve CF women (mean age 30 years, mean Shwachman score 85) kept daily
   records during three menstrual cycles of lung function, sputum quality
   and need for intravenous antibiotics. Paired t-test was used as a
   statistical method to compare the airway symptoms between the time of
   ovulation (high levels of oestrogen and low levels of progesterone), the
   luteal phase (high levels of oestrogen and progesterone) and
   menstruation (low levels of oestrogens and progesterone).
   Forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) was significantly higher during
   the luteal phase (66\% of predicted) compared to during ovulation (63\%)
   and menstruation (61\%) (P<0.01). Forced vital capacity (FVC) showed the
   same pattern, being significantly higher during the luteal phase
   compared with during menstruation (mean 75\% vs. 70\%. P<0.01).
   In conclusion, lung function changes were found during menstrual cycles
   in women with cystic fibrosis. These changes are probably related to
   changes in progesterone levels during the menstrual cycles. This result
   warrants further studies to understand the complexity of CF lung disease
   in women.}},

Abstract = {{Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) is a membrane-bound
   zinc-metallopeptidase that is related to neprilysin in amino acid
   sequence. A major in vivo function of ECE-1 is the proteolytic
   conversion of big endothelin-1 to endothelin-1, one of the most potent
   vasconstricting peptides known. Although ECE-1 was once thought to be
   specific for the processing of endothelin precursors, it is now known
   that the enzyme hydrolyzes a number of peptide hormones. We have
   incorporated knowledge gained from recent studies of ECE-I substrate
   specificity to aid the design of internally-quenched fluorescent
   substrates derived from bradykinin, The best of these substrates,
   (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)
   acetyl-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Ala-Phe-Lys(2,4-dinitrophenyl), is
   hydrolyzed by ECE-1 with a k(cat)/K-m value of 1.9 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1),
   making it the most sensitive substrate yet described for ECE-1, The
   substrate is suitable for the rapid, continuous assay of the enzyme
   using a microplate format in a fluorescence plate reader, thereby
   simplifying both the purification of ECE-1 and the characterization of
   its inhibitors. It is demonstrated that (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)
   acetyl-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Ala-Phe-Lys(2,4-dinitrophenyl) is also a
   substrate for neprilysin, but is hydrolyzed 10-fold more efficiently by
   ECE-1, making this substrate selective for ECE-1, Furthermore, this
   synthetic peptide is a poor substrate for the matrix metalloproteinases.

Abstract = {{Airborne and surface lead exposures were evaluated for construction
   trade groups at a previously deleaded bridge renovation site in the
   midwestern United States. Although all lead-based paint should have been
   removed, old layers of leaded paint were still present on some sections
   of the bridge. Ironworkers performing metal torch cutting had the
   highest exposures (188 mug/m(3)), followed by workers engaged in
   clean-up operations and paint removal (p < 0.001). Respirators were most
   frequently worn by workers with the greatest lead exposures; however,
   laborers performing clean-up operations had exposures to lead dust of 43
   <mu>g/m(3) and often wore no respiratory protection. Wipe samples
   revealed that almost all contractor vehicles were contaminated with
   lead. Heavy equipment operators with low airborne lead exposure had the
   highest levels of surface contamination in personal vehicles (3600
   mug/m(2)). Laborers cleaning structural steel with compressed air and
   ironworkers exposed to lead fumes from cutting had the highest
   concentrations of lead dust on clothing (mean 4766 mug/m(2)).
   Hand-washing facilities were provided, but were infrequently used. No
   separate clothes changing facility was available at the site. The
   potential for ``take-home{''} contamination was high, even though this
   site was thought to be relatively free of lead. Construction contractors
   and their workers need to be aware that previous deleading of a site may
   not preclude exposure to significant amounts of lead.}},

Abstract = {{Nedd4 is a member of a growing family of ubiquitin-protein ligases which
   consist of a lipid-binding domain, two to four WW domains and a
   C-terminal ubiquitin-protein ligase domain. The Nedd4 mRNA levels are
   developmentally regulated and Nedd4 protein is highly expressed in many
   mouse embryonic tissues. In this study we have used a far-Western screen
   to identify embryonic proteins that interact with the WW domains in
   mouse Nedd4. We report here identification of eight Nedd4
   WW-domain-interacting proteins from mouse embryonic cDNA expression
   libraries. Two of the proteins are novel, while two have been identified
   previously as ligands for a WW domain. All of these proteins contain one
   or more PY motifs. In seven of the eight proteins, these PY motifs are
   necessary for their interaction with the WW domains of Nedd4. Using
   site-directed mutagenesis, and by using individual WW domains of Nedd4
   as probes for far-Western analysis, we show that the three WW domains in
   Nedd4 interact with varying affinities with the PY motifs present in
   various Nedd4-binding proteins. These results provide evidence that
   Nedd4 can potentially interact with multiple proteins, possibly
   simultaneously, through its WW domains.}},

Abstract = {{Several major federal environmental statutes enacted in the 1970s
   designate federal, state, and tribal resource management agencies as
   trustees of natural resources on behalf of the public and enable the
   trustees to recover damages for injuries to public resources. The
   measure of damages in the statutes is the cost of restoring the
   resources to baseline conditions, plus the interim loss in value from
   the time of the incident until full recovery of the resources. The
   statutory restriction limiting use of the monies to enhancing or
   creating natural resources motivated the development of an alternative
   measure for interim losses-the cost of compensatory restoration actions
   providing in-kind compensation. In this paper alternative measures of
   damages are outlined and approaches and methods for scaling compensatory
   restoration are discussed. Two basic scaling approaches are presented: a
   simplified in-kind trading procedure and the more general valuation
   approach, in which a variety of economic methods may be employed to
   assess the trade-offs between gains from proposed actions and interim
   losses from the injuries. Experience indicates that natural resource
   liability actions represent a potent tool for federal and state resource
   managers to address injuries to public resources.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the analysis of clonogenic survival data for human colonic
   adenocarcinoma cells (WiDr) after a single heating, a new model is
   proposed to describe cell survival after hyperthermia quantitatively,
   The effects of heat are explained as heat-induced cell damage assuming a
   first-order (single-hit) and a second-order (cumulative damage) process.
   Thus cell survival at a specified temperature can be described by the
   linear-quadratic (LQ) model. The proposed model is based on an
   alternative definition of the (single) thermal dose, given as the
   (normalized) product of heating time and a specified nonlinear function
   of the increase in temperature (relative to a threshold temperature) to
   be interpreted as the thermal dose rate. In further analogy to the
   modeling of the effects of low-dose-rate radiation, an inherent capacity
   of the cells to repair sublethal damage is assumed, and these effects
   are quantified by the usual g factor measuring incomplete repair
   effects. The model defines thermal dose-response and isoeffect dose
   relationships, enabling a direct (i.e. single-step) analysis of the
   available thermal response data. Additionally, the analysis of our data
   based on heating times in the range from 0 to 360 min and temperatures
   from 41 to 46 degreesC and covering a broad spectrum of different
   densities of cells seeded for colony formation did not yield any
   evidence of the existence of a breaking point usually derived from
   Arrhenius plots based on the single-hit, multitarget model and the
   Arrhenius equation, The model includes no specific assumptions
   describing the development of thermotolerance, which can be assumed to
   be negligible under our experimental conditions. The proposed thermal
   dose-response model correlates satisfactorily with the in vitro survival
   data for WiDr adenocarcinoma cells. (C) 2000 by Radiation Research

Abstract = {{Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to study the high
   temperature phase behaviour of mixed crystal of K1-chi(NH4)(chi) H2PO4
   in the KDP rich region (chi < 0.02). All of the mixed crystals show
   phase-transition like phenomena at a characteristic temperature T-p, few
   degrees above that for pure KDP, i.e. 180 degreesC. Our results show
   that T-p marks the onset of a thermal dehydration of the samples when
   they are heated above this temperature. The rate of the corresponding
   dehydration reaction is faster for samples with ADP impurities
   indicating that the density of reaction sites or their propagation from
   the surface to the interior of the crystal increase with the impurities.

Abstract = {{A plan has been put forth to strategically thin northern California
   forests to reduce fire danger and improve forest health. The resulting
   biomass residue, instead of being open burned, can be converted into
   ethanol that can be used as a fuel oxygenate or an octane enhancer.
   Economic potential for a biomass-to-ethanol facility using this softwood
   biomass was evaluated for two cases: stand-alone and co-located. The
   colocated case refers to a specific site with an existing biomass power
   facility near Martell, California. A two-stage dilute acid hydrolysis
   process is used for the production of ethanol from softwoods, and the
   residual lignin is used to generate steam and electricity. For a plant
   processing 800 dry tonnes per day of feedstock, the co-located case is
   an economically attractive concept. Total estimated capital investment
   is approximately \$70 million for the co-located plant, and the
   resulting internal rate of return (IRR) is about 24\% using 25\% equity
   financing. A sensitivity analysis showed that ethanol selling price and
   fixed capital investment have a substantial effect on the IRR. It can be
   concluded that such a biomass-to-ethanol plant seems to be an appealing
   proposition for California, if ethanol replaces methyl tert-butyl ether,
   which is slated for a phaseout.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To compare storage phosphor (SP) with conventional film
   radiography for accuracy of linear measurements of the marginal alveolar
   bone and visibility of anatomical structures.
   Methods: Linear measurements were made in paired SP and conventional
   images of dried human mandibles with a metal pin fixed 10 mm below the
   alveolar crest. One observer measured the distance from the alveolar
   crest to the reference point on the radiographs, The difference between
   the measured and the true distance was calculated, Two observers rated
   the visibility of bony structures (periodontal ligament space,
   periapical bone tissue, alveolar crest) in 51 paired digital and
   conventional images of 21 patients on a 3-point scale. Overall agreement
   and Kappa index were calculated.
   Results: Accuracy of linear measurements was higher in digital
   radiography (mean difference 0.17 mm) than in conventional radiography
   (mean difference 0.59 mm). Overall, the two observers rated visibility
   higher in conventional radiographs. The Kappa indices for the
   periodontal ligament space and periapical bone indicated fair to almost
   perfect agreement (kappa = 0.38 and 0.5; kappa = 0.39 and 0.54) while
   for the alveolar crest there was only poor or moderate agreement (kappa
   = 0,2 and 0,5),
   Conclusions: The small differences in Linear measurements indicate that
   the Digora(R) system is suitable for clinical assessment of periodontal
   and peri-implant bone loss. The visibility of dental structures depends
   as much on the individual features assessed, as the radiographic system.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To validate the causes of death determined with a single
   verbal autopsy instrument covering all age groups in the Agincourt
   subdistrict of rural South Africa.
   METHODS Verbal autopsies (VAs) were conducted on all deaths recorded
   during annual demographic and health surveillance over a 3-year period
   (1992-95) in a population of about 63 000 people. Trained field-workers
   elicited signs and symptoms of the terminal illness from a dose
   caregiver, using a comprehensive questionnaire written in the local
   language. Questionnaires were assessed blind by three clinicians who
   assigned a probable cause of death using a stepwise consensus process.
   Validation involved comparison of VA diagnoses with hospital reference
   diagnoses obtained for those who died in a district hospital; and
   calculation of sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value
   (PPV) for children under 5 years, and adults 15 years and older.
   RESULTS A total of 127 hospital diagnoses satisfied the criteria for
   inclusion as reference diagnoses. For communicable diseases, sensitivity
   of VA diagnoses among children was 69\%, specificity 96\%, and PPV 90\%;
   among adults the values were 89, 93 and 76\%. Lower values were found
   for non-communicable diseases: 75, 91 and 86\% among children; and 64,
   50 and 80\% among adults. Most misclassification occurred within the
   category itself. For deaths due to accidents or violence, sensitivity
   was 100\%, specificity 97\%, and PPV 80\% among children; and 75, 98 and
   60\% among adults. Since causes of death were largely age-specific, few
   differences in sensitivity, specificity and PPV were found for adults
   and children. The frequency distribution of causes of death based on VAs
   closely approximated that of the hospital records used for validation.
   CONCLUSION VA findings need to be validated before they can be applied
   to district health planning. In Agincourt, a single verbal autopsy
   instrument provided a reasonable estimate of the frequency of causes of
   death among adults and children. Findings can be reliably used to inform
   local health planning and evaluation.}},

   spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP), protons at entry (E), or Co-60 and
   euthanized on days 0.5-17 thereafter. Co-60-irradiated animals had
   decreased erythrocytes, hemiglobin and hematocrit at 12 hours
   post-exposure; depression was not noted in proton (SOBP or E)-irradiated
   groups until day 4. Significantly decreased leukocyte counts were
   observed at this same time in all irradiated groups, with lymphocyte
   loss being greater than that of monocytes, and the depression was
   generally maintained. In contrast, the levels of neutrophils and
   thrombocytes fluctuated, especially during the first week; significant
   differences were noted among irradiated groups in neutrophils levels.
   Plasma TGF-beta1 was elevated on day 7 in the Co-60, but not proton,
   irradiated mice. Collectively, the data show that dramatic and
   persistent changes occurred in all irradiated groups. However, few
   differences in assay results were seen between animals exposed to

   with either of the two regions of the proton Bragg curve.}},

Abstract = {{Hemorrhagic complications have been reported after repeated exposures to

   low factor V level with positive factor V inhibitor. Treatment with
   plasmapheresis and steroid successfully reversed the coagulopathy.
   Detailed case review failed to reveal exposure to any thrombin products

Abstract = {{EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate), one of the catechin compounds abundant
   mainly in green tea, has chemopreventive effects against carcinogenesis.
   The extract at 50 degreesC water from the powder of green tea was
   partitioned with chloroform and ethyl acetate. The resulting solution
   was further purified on three different columns, 4.6x250 mm (40/63 mum),
   4.6x250 mm (15 mum), 3.9x300 mm (10 mum), in order to separate EGCG
   among catechin compounds from green tea. In a given packing size, the
   composition of the binary mobile phase, water and acetonitrile, with
   0.1\% acetic acid was changed to operate in optimized experimental
   conditions. In a packed column of 40/63 mum packing, catechin compounds
   were not well separated. With packing sizes of 15 and 10 mum, the
   resolution of EGCG among catechin compounds was better, and maximum
   injection volume to separate EGCG purely was 100 and 480 mul,
   respectively. The study on the effect of packing size may be utilized
   for preparative chromatographic separation.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have described the use of transesophageal
   echocardiography (TEE) with acoustic quantification (AQ) in assessing
   aortic elastic properties. We hypothesized that patients with a prior
   history of stroke (ST) may have a higher risk of atherosclerotic change
   in great vessels compared to nonstroke subjects (NST) and thus have
   decreased elastic properties. We assessed the elastic properties of the
   descending thoracic aorta (DTA) by TEE in ST patients and compared them
   with data in NST patients. Subjects included 31 with ST without any
   evidence of emboli originating from the heart (age 51 +/- 10 years, M:F
   = 20:11) and 25 age-matched NST (M:F = 8:17). Patients with significant
   valvular heart disease including aortic and mitral regurgitation, left
   ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 55\%), and congenital heart
   disease were excluded. Compliance (C), distensibility (D), and stiffness
   index: (SI) were measured using AQ and M-mode measurement at a level of
   the left atrium. We scored atherosclerotic risk factors (ARF) such as a
   history of diabetes, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and
   the presence of atheroma of DTA. There was no evidence of atheroma of
   DTA in NST There were no significant differences in heart rate and
   systolic and diastolic blood pressure between ST and NST patients.
   Fractional area change (FAC) of DTA was significantly lower in. ST than
   in NST patients (3.2 +/- 1.6 us 5.4 +/- 2.5\%, P = 0.000). ST patients
   had significantly lower C (1.2 +/- 0.4 us 1.5 +/- 0. 7 x 10(-3) cm(2)
   mmHg(-1), P = 0.039), lower D (0.8 +/- 0.3 us 1.5 +/- 0.8 x 10(-3)
   mmHg(-1) P = 0.000), and higher SI (10.3 +/- 8.8 vs 5.3 +/- 2.9, P =
   0.006) than NST patients. STpatients without atheroma of DTA (n = 21)
   also had significantly lower C (1.1 +/- 0.4 vs 1.5 +/- 0. 7 x 10(-3)
   cm(2) mmHg(-1), P = 0. 038) and lower D (3.5 +/- 1.4 vs 4.8 +/- 2.4 x
   10(-3) mmHg(-1) P = 0.021) than NST patients. There was a significant
   positive correlation between SI and the score of ARF (r = 0.51, P =
   0.000). The regional elastic properties of DTA measured by TEE with AQ
   and M-mode method were abnormal in ST. Therefore, TEE with AQ technique
   may have a possible clinical application for the detection of early
   atherosclerotic changes such as alteration of elastic properties in
   morphological normal DTA.}},

   with no associated predisposing risk factors. The rarity of this
   condition and its atypical presentation should be borne in mind while
   treating an adult patient with anterior knee pain. Point tenderness over
   the patella should alert a physician to the possibility of osteomyelitis
   of the patella. The value of bone scan and computed tomography in the
   early stages to help diagnose this condition has been stressed. The

Abstract = {{The data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach has been widely applied to
   measure the relative efficiencies of decision making units (DMUs) for a
   time period. This article measures the performance improvement of a DMU
   at two time points by using the DEA approach. Two ideas are proposed.
   One is to treat one DMU at two time points as two different DMUs, and
   the ratio of the efficiency scores of a DMU at two time points serves as
   a measure of the efficiency improvement. The other is to calculate the
   Malmquist productivity index of a DMU to represent its productivity
   improvement. Both the efficiency ratio and the productivity index can be
   decomposed into the technical part and the scale part. From the data of
   the eight forest districts of Taiwan compiled in 1989 and 1992, the
   efficiency and productivity improvement in these two periods are
   measured. The results of the two methods are consistent in that both
   indicate a slight improvement in performance.}},

Abstract = {{Chromosome 5A of wheat is known to carry a number of genes affecting
   adaptability and productivity. To localize quantitative trait loci
   (QTLs) controlling grain yield and its components, an RFLP map was
   constructed from 118 single-chromosome recombinant lines derived from
   the F-1 between Chinese Spring (Cappelle-Desprez 5A) and Chinese Spring
   (Triticum spelta 5A). The map was combined with the field-trial data
   scored over 3 years. A total of five regions in chromosome 5A
   contributed effects on yield traits. Increases in grain yield, 50-grain
   weight and spikelet number/ear were determined by complementary QTL
   alleles from both parents. The effects associated with the vernalization
   requirement gene Vrn-A1 or a closely linked QTL were significant only in
   the favorable growing season where the later-flowering vrn-A1 allele
   from Cappelle-Desprez 5A produced a higher tiller number/plant and
   spikelet number/ear. The effects of the ear morphology gene q or closely
   linked QTL(s) were detected for grain yield and ear grain weight. Three
   other QTLs with minor effects were dispersed along chromosome 5A. These
   QTLs had large interactions with years due to changes in the magnitude
   of the significant response. The alleles from T. spelta, however,
   conferred a higher yield performance.}},

Abstract = {{The total protein mixture from the 50S subunit (TP-50) of the
   eubacterium Thermus thermophilus was characterized after blotting onto
   PVDF membranes from two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
   (2D-PAGE) and sequencing. The proteins were numbered according to their
   primary structure similarity with their counterparts from other species.
   One of them has been marked with an asterisk, namely L{*}23, because
   unlike the other known ribosomal proteins it shows a very low degree of
   homology.
   A highly acidic 5S rRNA binding protein, TL5, was characterized and
   compared with the available primary structure information.
   Proteins L1 and L4 migrate similarly on 2D-PAGE. Protein L4, essential
   for protein biosynthesis, is N-terminally blocked and shows a strikingly
   low homology to other L4 proteins. In addition to L4, two other
   proteins, namely L10 and L11, were found to be N-terminally blocked.
   In conclusion, 33 proteins from the large subunit were identified,
   including TL5. Homologs to rpL25 and rpL26 were not found.}},

Abstract = {{One hypothesis to explain the southern extension of Japanese
   encephalitis (IE) virus from Papua New Guinea into the Torres Strait
   islands in 1995 and to mainland Australia in 1998 is the dispersal of
   infected mosquitoes, particularly Culex annulirostris Skuse from which
   JE virus has been isolated repeatedly. To investigate whether this
   species disperses in this manner, mosquitoes were identified from 368
   aerial kite trap collections operated at 50-310 m (altitude) at inland
   New South Wales between November 1979 to December 1984. Forty samples (9
   during daylight and 31 at night) contained mosquitoes, of which 221
   could be identified as Culex australicus Dobrotworsky \& Drummond
   (58.8\%), Culex annulirostris (21.3\%), Anopheles annulipes Walker s.l.
   (10.4\%), Aedes theobaldi (Taylor) (7.2\%), Aedes rubrithorax (Macquart)
   (1.4\%), and Aedes sagax (Skuse) (<0.9\%). During the night, mosquitoes
   were found in 22.6\% of the collections at a mean density (+/-SD) of
   91.3 +/- 151.7/10(6) m(3) of air sampled. During the day, only 3.8\%
   were positive at a mean density 125.3 +/- 152.1. When examined in
   relation to possible flying time and wind speed, mean +/- SD dispersal
   distances by day and night were 23.9 +/- 15.3 km and 152.4 +/- 116.3
   km,respectively. These data provide circumstantial evidence that aerial
   carriage southward <approximate to> 200 km from Papua New Guinea to Cape
   York peninsula is feasible, but that southern dispersal of Murray Valley
   encephalitis virus infected mosquitoes from tropical to temperate
   Australia is unlikely.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of ample information about the distribution and the effects of
   basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the central nervous system, few
   data are available concerning the localization of this protein in the
   peripheral nervous system. In view of the role of bFGF in the regulation
   of trophic and non-trophic functions, we focused on the presence and
   precise localization of this growth factor in normal peripheral nerves
   at the electron microscopic level. The study shows that bFGF is mainly
   located in the Schwann cells, especially in the nuclei. There is slight
   labeling in the myelin sheath and in the axon cytoplasm. The study
   provides morphologic evidence for an association between bFGF expression
   and Schwann cells. Such an association argues for a role of this peptide
   in the maintenance or regeneration of peripheral nerves.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To compare endopyelotomy and primary reconstructive procedures
   in patients with pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction and with risk
   factors for endopyelotomy failure.
   Patients and methods Nineteen patients (eight female and 11 male, mean
   age 34.5 years, range 15-82) underwent endoluminal ultrasonography (US)
   before treatment for PUJ obstruction; the US findings were used to
   direct the treatment. Patients with unavoidable crossing vessels,
   massive hydronephrosis and crossing vessels associated with previous
   failed endopyelotomy were selected for reconstructive surgery. The
   clinical results of these patients (group 1) were compared with 12
   consecutive patients who had undergone endopyelotomy before the use of
   endoluminal ultrasonography (group 2).
   Results Imaging detected 17 crossing vessels in 13 of the 19 patients.
   Six patients underwent primary reconstructive surgery and 13 underwent
   endopyelotomy. The endoluminal US findings changed treatment in some way
   in nine patients. Endopyelotomy was successful in 12 of the 13 patients
   and reconstructive surgery successful in five of six patients. The
   success after endopyelotomy improved from eight in 12 patients in group
   2 to 12 of 13 in group 1 (P = 0.16, NS).
   Conclusions Endoluminal US can be used to select patients in whom
   endopyelotomy is likely to fail. Using primary reconstructive procedures
   in these patients might improve the overall outcome, but these
   preliminary findings need to be confirmed in a larger study.}},

Abstract = {{The neuroprotective drug riluzole (Rilutek(R)) is a sodium channel
   blocker and anti-excitotoxic drug which is marketed for the treatment of
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Previous studies have shown that
   riluzole prolongs survival of transgenic mice harboring the mutated form
   of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase found in familial forms of the human
   disease. In this study we have examined the effect of treatment with
   riluzole in mice suffering from progressive motor neuronopathy (pmn), a
   hereditary autosomal recessive wasting disease which shares some
   symptoms of ALS. These mutants display hind limb weakness starting
   during the 3rd week of Life and leading to paralysis and death during
   the 7th week of life. Daily treatment with 8 mg/kg of riluzole by oral
   route significantly retarded the appearance of paralysis, increased life
   span and improved motor performance on grip test and electromyographic
   results in the early stage of the disease. There was no effect of
   riluzole on weight gain. These data demonstrate that riluzole
   significantly prolongs life span, retards the onset of paralysis and
   slows the evolution of functional parameters connected with muscle
   strength in the pmn mouse model of motor neuron disease. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Background Surveys have identified a dramatically rising incidence of
   work-related upper extremity cumulative trauma disorders (UECTDs).
   Outcome studies have addressed time lost from work and cost of
   compensation; omitting other significant consequences. We assess health,
   functional and family outcomes.
   Methods We identified 537 Workers' Compensation UECTD claimants. A
   computer-assisted assisted telephone questionnaire was used to elicit
   symptom prevalence, functional impairment, depressive symptoms (CES-D
   scale), employment status.
   Results One to 4 years post-claim, respondents reported persistent
   symptoms severe enough to interfere with work (53\%), home/recreation
   activities (64\%) and sleep (44\%). Only 64\% of responses to the
   activities of daily Living scale items indicated ``normal{''} function.
   Job loss was reported by 38\% of respondents, and depressive symptoms by
   31\%.
   Conclusions Work-related UECTDs result in persisting symptoms and
   difficulty in performing simple activities of daily living, impacting
   home life even more than work. Job loss, symptoms of depression, and
   family disruption were common. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Senescence has been proposed as an important safeguard against
   neoplasia. One of the hallmarks of cellular senescence in vitro as well
   as human aging in vivo is a reduced intracellular protein catabolism.
   The pathways affected and the mechanisms responsible for the decrease in
   overall protein turnover in aging cells are not well understood. Our aim
   was to determine whether or not expression of one of the major hepatic
   lysosomal cysteine peptidases, cathepsin B, changes during aging of
   Sprague-Dawley rats. Cathepsin B activity was assessed in whole rat
   liver homogenates, and was found to be increased fourfold (P less than
   or equal to0.001) in aged livers compared with younger counterparts.
   This was paralleled by an at least a twofold increase in mature
   cathepsin B protein. Nonetheless, Northern blot analysis of total liver
   RNA revealed no change in steady-state levels of cathepsin B mRNAs.
   These findings seem to contradict the present dogma according to which
   aging tissues have a reduced intracellular capacity to catabolise
   proteins. We propose that our earlier observation of the accumulation of
   T-kininogen, a potent but reversible cysteine peptidase inhibitor, in
   aging rat liver may provide a plausible explanation for this
   discrepancy.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the complications and results of Hartmann's
   procedure and secondary restoration of continuity for left-sided colonic
   disease.
   Design: Retrospective study
   Setting: University hospitals, Northern ireland.
   Subjects: 72 Patients who required a Hartmann's procedure over a 13 year
   period (1985-1998).
   Intervention: Of these 45 (63\%) were done as emergencies and 27 (38\%)
   as elective procedures. The indications for an emergency procedure were
   obstruction and perforation.
   Main outcome measures: Mortality, morbidity, reversal of stoma rate.
   Results: The overall postoperative mortality was 7/72 (10\%), with no
   significant difference between the emergency (4/45, 9\%) and the
   elective (3/27, 11\%) groups. Postoperative complications occurred in 31
   patients (43\%), and 8 developed wound infections (11\%). Of the 43
   surviving patients who where deemed suitable for re-establishment of
   continuity, 30 (70\%) have had it done. There were no postoperative
   deaths or anastomotic dehiscences after the restoration of continuity.
   Conclusion: Hartmann's procedure remains a safe and suitable option in
   patients with left sided colonic emergencies.}},

Abstract = {{In many recent low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, intersatellite
   links (ISLs) are used to enhance the capability of the networks, The
   ISLs are continuously deleted and established since the visibility
   between satellites changes over time. These topological changes require
   rerouting of the traffic on ISLs, which unavoidably involves dropping of
   some ongoing calls, Tn general, such an ongoing call dropping degrades
   the quality-of-service (QoS) more severely than an initiated fall
   blocking In this paper, rye propose a call admission control scheme that
   allows a flexible tradeoff between dropped ongoing calls and blocked
   initiated calls. The call admission control scheme makes use of two
   techniques: traffic recasting and traffic projection. The traffic
   recasting maps the current traffic onto the network after the
   topological change whereas the traffic projection projects the recast
   traffic from the current time to the time of the topological change. The
   projected traffic is used to estimate the increase in ongoing call
   dropping whose QoS penalty is compared against that of increased newly
   initiated call blocking to make the cap admission decision. Simulation
   results show that the proposed call admission control scheme
   significantly reduces the ongoing call dropping probability with only a
   marginal increase in the initiated call blocking and call completion
   probabilities.}},

Abstract = {{To demonstrate the superoxide radical (.O-2(-))-scavenging activity of
   2-mercaptoethylamine (MEA), we investigated the induction of the
   oxidative stress-inducible (soi) gene fused IncZ gene (soi-28::lacZ) by
   the use of paraquat as a source of .O-2(-). When MEA or cysteine was
   added to the cultures before paraquat treatment, soi gene induction by
   paraquat was significantly inhibited. However, a high quantity of
   ascorbic acid (5 mM) inhibited soi gene induction by paraquat far less
   than MEA or cysteine did. The induction of soi gene induction by MEA
   exhibited a dose-dependent manner in the range of over 0.3 mM. The
   antagonistic molecules on the radioprotective action of MEA, ascorbic
   acid and cysteine did not counteract MEA action on the inhibition of
   paraquat-mediated soi gene induction. To clarify that the MEA action on
   the inhibition of paraquat-mediated soi gene induction may be due, in
   part, to .O-2(-)-scavenging activity, we investigated the ability of MEA
   to inhibit the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction mediated by .O-2(-)
   generated in the xanthine oxidase/hypoxanthine system in vitro. At
   concentrations above 1 mM, MEA effectively inhibited the NET reduction
   in a concentration-dependent fashion. Our results demonstrated that MEA
   has an ability to scavenge .O-2(-), and so protects against
   .O-2(-)-mediated damage. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{A thermal-hydraulic analysis methodology is established for a

   (KNU-1) power plant using RETRAN-3D. The effects of the important
   parameters on PTS are evaluated, such as the initial power level, break
   size, isolation of the depressurized steam generator (SG), and charging
   flow runback. As a result, the most dominant factors are revealed as the
   initial power level and break flow rate. Auxiliary feedwater (AFW) to
   the depressurized SG should be isolated by operator action as soon as
   possible to minimize break flow. To mitigate the risk of PTS by reducing
   both steam flow rate and operator response time of depressurized SG
   isolation, the installation of check valves to block the crossflow
   between two steam lines is recommended. An efficient grouping
   methodology is proposed using these results. Groups should be divided

Abstract = {{An extended conservative formalism of the characteristic boundary
   conditions is presented on the basis of the generalized coordinates for
   practical computational aeroacoustics. The formalism is derived for
   solving the entire conservative form of the compressible Euler or
   Navier-Stokes equations on the body-fitted grid mesh system by using the
   high-order and high-resolution numerical schemes. It includes the
   matrices of transformation between the conservative and the
   characteristic variables, which were already derived In the literature
   to analyze the eigenvalue-eigenvector modes in an arbitrary direction.
   The conservation-form governing equations with their full terms are
   solved at the boundaries, and no kind of extrapolation or simplification
   of the equations is included in this formalism. Additional correction
   terms are devised to preserve the conservative form of flux derivative
   terms in the generalized coordinates. Especially, the soft inflow
   conditions are presented to keep the nonreflecting features, as well as
   to maintain the mean value of inflow velocity at the inlet boundary.
   These boundary conditions are applied to the actual computation of
   two-dimensional viscous cylinder flows with Reynolds number of 400 on
   the grid meshes clustered on the cylinder surface and the downstream
   region. The Strouhal number due to von Karman vortex streets,
   root-mean-square lift coefficient, and mean drag coefficient are
   evaluated correctly in comparison,vith experimental data. The far-field
   sound pressure levels are measured directly in this computation, and the
   accuracy is validated by an analytic formula derived in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PE;) is activated by DNA strand breaks
   and participates in DNA repair. Its regulatory subunit, Ku autoantigen,
   binds to DNA and recruits the catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). We show here
   a new role of DNA-PK in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR).
   The Ku-DNA binding activity, the levels of Ku70/Ku80 and DNA-PKcs in MDR
   variants, CEM/VLB10-2, CEM/VLB55-8 and CEM/VLB100 were higher than those
   in their parental drug-sensitive CEM cells in a drug
   resistance-dependent fashion. Also, CEM/VLB100 cells showed about 3-fold
   increase of DNA-PK enzyme activity as compared with CEM cells. Similar
   results were observed in another MDR cell line, FM3A/M mouse mammary
   carcinoma cells. Moreover, we observed that CEM/VLB100 cells were about
   Ii-fold sensitive to wortmannin, which inhibits DNA-PK, compared with
   the CEM cells, and sensitized the MDR cells when combined with either
   bleomycin or vincristine, but have a little effect on CEM cells.
   Wortmannin was shown to inhibit DNA-PK and Ku-DNA binding activity in
   CEM/VLB100 cells dose dependently but had a little or no effect on their
   parental cells. Our results suggested that enhanced expression of DNA-PK
   participates in the development of MDR, and the use of DNA-PK inhibitors
   such as wortmannin is likely to improve the effectiveness of anticancer
   drugs and thus could partially overcome drug resistance in MDR cells,
   through its ability to inhibit Ku/DNA-PK activity. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective. To examine whether symptoms of striatofrontal dysfunction
   contribute to disability in geriatric depression.
   Design. Cross-sectional evaluation of the relationship of specific
   cognitive impairments, psychomotor retardation, severity of depression,
   and medical burden to impairment of instrumental activities of daily
   living.
   Setting. Inpatient and outpatient services of a psychiatric university
   hospital located in a suburban metropolitan area.
   Patients. One hundred and fifty elderly psychiatric inpatients and
   outpatients with major depression and cognitive function ranging from
   normal to moderate dementia.
   Measures. Psychomotor retardation was evaluated with the Hamilton
   retardation item and executive dysfunction was assessed with the
   initiation/perseveration (IP) domain of the Dementia Rating Scale.
   Disability, severity of depression and medical burden were assessed with
   the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Index of the Multilevel
   Assessment Instrument, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the
   Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric, respectively.
   Results. In the entire sample (N = 150) and in the non-demented subjects
   (N = 101), stepwise regression analyses revealed that IP and psychomotor
   retardation were associated with IADL impairment. Additionally, a
   `striatofrontal component', which consisted of IP and psychomotor
   retardation was also significantly associated with IADL impairment in
   the whole sample, as well as in the non-demented patients.
   Conclusion. Clinical symptoms and neuropsychological findings associated

Abstract = {{Background: The primary site of pathology in Moebius syndrome is still
   unknown, although several studies have variably localized the lesion in
   the extraocular muscles, cranial nerves, or central nervous system.
   Case: A 24-year-old man with Poland-Moebius syndrome and acquired
   progressive bilateral paralytic lower eyelid ectropion is described.
   Observations: In this patient, magnetic resonance imaging studies
   revealed a barely detectable pontine hypoplasia and normal recti
   muscles. Nerve conduction studies of the facial nerves showed a severe
   demyelinating or dysmyelinating type of neuropathy. Bilateral lower
   eyelid ectropium of the patient was successfully corrected by canthal
   tightening procedures.
   Conclusion: Contrary to many reported cases, this patient serves as a
   rare example of a progressive type of Poland-Moebius syndrome presumably
   resulting from a combination of a brainstem abnormality and a peripheral
   neural degenerative process. (C) 2000 Japanese Ophthalmological Society.}},

Abstract = {{Heat-stress granules (HSG) are highly ordered, cytoplasmic chaperone
   complexes found in all heat-stressed plant cells. We have developed an
   experimental system involving expression of cytosolic class I and class
   II small heat-stress proteins (Hsps) of pea, Arabidopsis and tomato in
   tobacco protoplasts to study the structural prerequisites for the
   assembly of HSG or MSG-like complexes. Class I and class II small Hsps
   formed class-specific dodecamers of 210-280 kDa, which, upon heat
   stress, were incorporated into HSG complexes. Interestingly, class II
   dodecamers alone could form MSG-like complexes (auto-aggregation),
   whereas class I dodecamers could do so only in the presence of class II
   proteins (recruitment). By analysing C-terminal deletion forms of Hsp17
   class II, we obtained evidence that the intact C-terminus is critical
   for the oligomerization state, for the heat-stress-induced
   autoaggregation and for recruitment of class I proteins. The
   class-specific formation of dimers as a prerequisite for oligomerization
   was analysed by the yeast two-hybrid system. In the presence of the
   endogenous (tobacco) set of heat-stress-induced proteins, all
   heterologous class I and class II proteins were incorporated into HSG
   complexes, whose ultrastructure was different from that of complexes
   formed by class I and class II proteins alone. Although other, more
   distantly related, members of the Hsp20 family, i.e. the plastidic pea
   Hsp21, the Drosophila Hsp23 and the mouse Hsp25, were well expressed in
   tobacco protoplasts and formed homo-oligomers of 260-700 kDa, none of
   them could be recruited to HSG complexes.}},

Abstract = {{While a delayed initiation of visually guided saccades with increasing
   age has been documented in a number of studies, little research has been
   done on the control of antisaccades. The present study investigates
   aging effects on the control of visually guided saccades (prosaccades)
   and antisaccades as well as a selection of neuropsychological functions
   by the cross-sectional comparison of 14, 22, and 16 participants aged
   20-35 years, 59-73 years, and 74-88 years, respectively. The geriatric
   and neurological status of the elder participants (including evidence
   from computed tomography, electroencephalography, and neurological soft
   signs) was assessed. In four task blocks of 200 trials each, pro- and
   antisaccades were elicited under the 200-ms-gap and overlap conditions.
   Left- and right-sided stimuli were presented in random order at 4
   degrees, and the order of the task blocks was varied within each age
   group. In addition, the Wisconsin card-sorting test (WCST) and working
   memory, go-nogo discrimination, alertness, and stimulus-response
   incompatibility tests were administered. Participants aged 59-73 years
   exhibited widespread reductions of optomotor and neuropsychological
   performance, with greatest effect sizes of age differences in the
   optomotor parameters and the WCST measures. A further decay after the
   age of 73 years was discernible in those optomotor functions reflecting
   saccade disinhibition (in particular, directional errors during the
   antisaccade task and premature responses) and the performance in some
   neuropsychological tests. In line with previously published reports,
   variance in optomotor performance could be explained by two factors,
   accounting for a total of 76\% of the age variance. Our results suggest
   that the investigation of saccade control may be a highly sensitive tool
   for neurodevelopmental aging research.}},

Abstract = {{Underdoped high temperature superconductors (HTS) exhibit a `normal'
   state for energies E > E-g and/or temperatures T > T-0, and a pseudogap
   in their electronic spectrum for E < E-g and/or T-0 > T > T-c.
   Strikingly similar behavior occurs in the transition metal
   dichalcogenides (TMD) 2H-MX2, where M = Ta, Nb, and X = S, Se, both in
   the `normal' (T > T-0) and in the incommensurate charge-density wave
   (T-10DW > T > T-c) states. Such strikingly similar behavior has also
   been seen in the organic layered superconductors (OLS) kappa-(ET)(2)X,
   where ET is bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene, and X =
   Cu{[}N(CN)(2)]Cl, Cu{[}N(CN)(2)]Br, and Cu(SCN)(2), both in the `normal'
   region T > T-SDW > T-c and in the spin-density wave region T-SDW > T >
   T-c. In all three materials classes, the anomalous transport and
   thermodynamic properties associated with the pseudogap or density-wave
   regime are completely independent of the applied magnetic field
   strength, whereas the same properties below T-c are all strongly
   field-dependent. Hence, we propose that the pseudogap in the HTS arises
   from charge- and/or spin-density waves, and not from either
   superconducting fluctuations or ``preformed{''} charged quasiparticle
   pairs.}},

   studies, GFP expression was observed in all coronary arteries (normal,
   nondiseased) in the DNA-treated group, but not in control arteries, GFP
   plasmid DNA in the arterial wall was confirmed by PCR, and GFP presence
   in the pig coronaries was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Thus,
   DNA-eluting stents are capable of arterial transfection, and could be

Abstract = {{Diverse polycationic polymers have been used as nonviral transfection
   agents. Here we report the ability of colloidal silica particles with
   covalently attached cationic surface modifications to transfect plasmid
   DNA in vitro and make an attempt to describe the structure of the
   resulting transfection complexes. In analogy to the terms lipoplex and
   polyplex, we propose to describe the nanoparticle-DNA complexes by the
   term ``nanoplex{''}. Three batches, Si10E, Si100E, and Si26H, sized
   between 10 and 100 nm and with zeta potentials ranging from +7 to +31 mV
   at pH 7.4 were evaluated. The galactosidase expression plasmid DNA pCMV
   beta was immobilized on the particle surface and efficiently transfected
   Cos-1 cells. The transfection activity was accompanied by very low
   cytotoxicity, with LD50 values in the milligrams per milliliter range.
   The most active batch, Si26H, was produced by modification of
   commercially available silica particles with
   N-(6-aminohexyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, yielding spherical
   nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 26 nm and a zeta potential of +31
   mV at pH 7.4. Complexes of Si26H and pCMV beta plasmid DNA formed at w/w
   ratios of 10 were most effective in promoting transfection of Cos-l
   cells in the absence of serum. At this ratio, >90\% of the DNA was
   associated with the particles, yielding nanoplexes with a net negative
   surface charge. When the transfection medium was supplemented with 10\%
   serum, maximum gene expression was observed at a w/w ratio of 30, at
   which the resulting particle-DNA complexes possessed a positive surface
   charge. Transfection was strongly increased in the presence of 100 muM
   chloroquine in the incubation medium and reached approximately 30\% of
   the efficiency of a 60 kDa polyethylenimine. In contrast to
   polyethylenimine, no toxicity was observed at the concentrations
   required. Atomic force microscopy of Si26H-DNA complexes revealed a
   spaghetti-meatball-like structure. The surface of complexes prepared at
   a w/w ratio of 30 was dominated by particles half-spheres. Complex sizes
   correlated well with those determined previously by dynamic light
   scattering.}},

Abstract = {{A new transducer, using the effect of frustrated total internal
   reflection of electromagnetic waves, was developed for displacement and
   force measurements in muscle research. The physical theory for this
   effect predicts the formation of an evanescent electromagnetic field in
   the gap between two separated optical surfaces. This evanescent
   electromagnetic field enables the transmission of light across the gap
   between the two media, an effect not contained in ray optics formalism.
   In the apparatus described here, the optical surfaces were obtained by
   bevelling 2 optical fibres to angles higher than the specific critical
   angle of the media used. Since the amount of transmitted light depends
   strongly on the distance between the surfaces, very small forces are
   detectable if one fibre is used as a cantilever. To test the transducer
   a small myofibrillar bundle (20 mum diameter) was mounted isometrically
   on it and contraction activated by release of ``caged{''} Ca2+. Force
   and displacement steps of 180-220 nN and 9-11 nm respectively were

Abstract = {{We have investigated the structure of the EDA gene in a patient with the
   clinical symptoms of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia ( EDA).
   Electrophoretic analysis of the amplified fragment of exon 5 of the EDA
   gene in the affected boy revealed a PCR product that was shorter by
   similar to 20 bp than the same fragment obtained from a healthy
   individual. A similar shortened fragment, in addition to a normal one,
   also was found in his mother, suggesting that she was the carrier of
   this mutation. Sequence analysis of the mutated fragment displayed an
   18bp deletion, extending either from nucleotide 891 to 908 or from
   nucleotide 901 to 918. The deleted fragment encodes two (Gly-X-Y)
   repeats in the collagen-like domain of ectodysplasin-A, thus reducing
   the number of repeats from 19 to 17. These two mutations increase to 9
   the number of deletions in exon 5 described so far. The recurrent
   character of these mutations indicates that the collagen-like domain of
   ectodysplasin-A plays a critical role in the structure of this receptor
   and that the deletion may be responsible for the clinical symptoms of
   EDA.}},

   suppressed grasses as much as grasses suppressed shrubs, even though
   shrubs had six times more standing crop. In adjacent brush clumps,
   however, where shrub standing crop was 37 times grass standing crop,
   shrubs suppressed grasses strongly, whereas grasses did not suppress
   shrubs. Shrubs reduced available soil nitrogen more strongly than
   grasses did; but shrubs and grasses did not differ in their effects on
   light or soil water. On a per-gram basis, however, shrubs had smaller
   effects on light, nitrogen, and water consumption than grasses did. In
   spite of their smaller per-gram effects on resources, the secondary
   growth of shrubs allowed them to accumulate more mass and height, and to
   eventually displace grasses. During this process, competition between
   the woody and the herbaceous growth form changed from symmetric to

Abstract = {{Background: Computed tomography during arterial portography (CTAP) under
   temporary balloon occlusion of the hepatic artery (BOHA-CTAP) was
   introduced to evaluate pseudolesions caused by portal venous impairments
   such as arterioportal shunt and tumor thrombus.
   Methods: BOHA-CTAP was performed in seven patients with hepatocellular
   carcinoma and correlated with clinical outcomes, For patients with
   wedge-shaped defects suggestive of pseudolesions, BOHA-CTAP was obtained
   by a 5-F balloon occlusion catheter into the proper hepatic artery
   through the second 5-F introducer inserted into the common femoral
   artery a few centimeters below the first 5-F sheath for CTAP.
   Results: Eight pseudolesions were determined clinically on follow-up CT,
   ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imagings. On BOHA-CTAP, five of
   the eight pseudolesions were eliminated, and two were diminished in
   comparision with conventional CTAP. One wedge-shaped defect due to tumor
   thrombus in the portal vein did not show any change.
   Conclusion: BOHA-CTAP can reduce pseudolesions caused by portal venous
   impairments and enable the demarcation of the true tumors.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{79-111}},

Abstract = {{Based on the authors' previous work which established theoretical
   foundations of two, conceptual, successive convex relaxation methods,
   i.e., the SSDP (Successive Semidefinite Programming) Relaxation Method
   and the SSILP (Successive Semi-Infinite Linear Programming) Relaxation
   Method, this paper proposes their implementable Variants for general
   quadratic optimization problems. These problems have a linear objective
   function c(T) x to be maximized over a nonconvex compact feasible region
   F described by a finite number of quadratic inequalities. We introduce
   two new techniques, ``discretization{''} and ``localization,{''} into
   the SSDP and SSILP Relaxation Methods. The discretization technique
   makes it possible to approximate an infinite number of semi-infinite
   SDPs (or semi-infinite LPs) which appeared at each iteration of the
   original methods by a finite number of standard SDPs (or standard LPs)
   with a finite number of linear inequality constraints. We establish:
   Given any opera convex set U containing F, there is an implementable
   discretization of rile SSDP (or SSILP) Relaxation Method which generates
   a compact convex set C such that F subset of or equal to C subset of or
   equal to U in a finite number of iterations.
   The localization technique is for the cases where we are only interested
   in upper bounds on the optimal objective value (for a Bred objective
   function vector c) but not in a global approximation of the convex hull
   of F. This technique allows us to generate a convex relaxation of F that
   is accurate only in certain directions in a neighborhood of the
   objective direction c. This cuts ob redundant work to make the convex
   relaxation accurate in unnecessary directions. We establish:
   Given any positive number epsilon, there is an implementable
   localization-discretization of the SSDP (or SSILP) Relaxation Method
   which generates art tipper bound of the objective value within epsilon
   of its maximum in a finite number of iterations.}},

   rate, with momentum transfer of approximately muon mass magnitude, and a
   mixture of multipoles (dominated by 1(-)), does not require any

Abstract = {{During the first cycle of the National Water Quality Assessment
   (1992-1996), ground water in 20 of the nation's major hydrologic basins
   was analyzed for 90 pesticide compounds (pesticides and degradates). One
   or more of the pesticide compounds examined were detected at 48.4\% of
   the 2485 ground water sites sampled. However, approximately 70\% of the
   sites where pesticides were detected, two or more pesticide compounds
   analyzed were present-documenting the prevalence of pesticide mixtures
   in ground water. The pesticide concentrations encountered were generally
   low, with the median total concentration (summation of concentrations
   for the 90 pesticide compounds) being 0.046 mug/L. Pesticides were
   commonly detected in shallow ground water beneath both agricultural
   (60.4\%) and urban (48.5\%) areas. This is an important finding because,
   although agricultural activities have long been associated with
   pesticide contamination, urban areas have only recently been recognized
   as a potential source of these types of compounds. Pesticides with
   higher frequencies of detection were generally those with more extensive
   use greater environmental persistence, and greater mobility in ground
   water (lower soil-water partition coefficients).}},

Abstract = {{Mass matrices arise in the numerical solution of time-dependent partial
   differential equations by the Galerkin method. Since these systems must
   be inverted at each time step, rapid inversion algorithms for these
   systems are important. When nodal finite elements are used as basis
   functions, it is known that the mass matrices can be consistently
   approximated by a diagonal matrix or solved by a scalable conjugate
   gradient method. This may not be the case for other basis functions. In
   this paper, we show that the preconditioned conjugate gradient method is
   scalable when used to invert mass matrices that arise from vector finite
   element basis functions. These basis functions are particularly
   important for solving Maxwell's equations on unstructured grids by the

Abstract = {{Increasing demand for donor organs has led to new pharmacological
   concepts for reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R) of the graft
   after liver transplantation to prevent primary non-functioning of the
   organ. Prostaglandins have proved to be cytoprotective in several
   experimental models of ischemia and transplantation. The prophylactic
   administration after orthotopic liver transplantation is still a subject
   of controversial discussion. The aim of our study was the evaluation of
   the post-transplant hepatic artery resistive index (RI) measured by
   color Doppler imaging, in combination with postoperative elevation of
   transaminases, as parameters indicating the need for a differentiated
   systemic therapy with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) (alprostadil). In
   addition, the value of serum procalcitonin (PCT) as a postoperative
   parameter for the extent of I/R is investigated. In the case of
   post-transplant elevated hepatic artery RI (RI > 0.75). the
   administration of PGE1 led to a significant reduction of transaminases
   (p < 0.05) and a decline of the RI. In addition, postoperative PCT
   levels could be reduced significantly by PGE1 application. These results
   suggest that determination of RI is feasible for indicating a need for
   therapy with PGE1. Its targeted application reduces hepatocellular
   damage due to I/R after liver transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{The high incidence of inappropriate therapies due to supraventricular
   tachycardia remains a major unsolved problem of the implantable

   systematically analyze sensitivity and specificity of the MD criterion
   in combination with the enhanced detection criteria sudden onset and
   rate stability in the detection of ventricular and supraventricular
   tachycardia.
   After ICD implantation in 259 patients, 787 detected episodes in 74
   patients with available stored electrograms were documented during a
   follow-up period of 359+/-214 days. With a nominal programming of the MD
   algorithm at >60\%, sensitivity and specificity for all episodes were
   82.6\%/77.2\%. For sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and atrial
   flutter the specificities were 80.6\%, 69.6\% and 75\%, respectively. In
   patients with primarily appropriate MD detection, sensitivity and
   specificity significantly improved to 95.8\%/91.7\%. Programming the
   sudden onset criterion with <100 ms and the stability criterion with <50
   ms, sensitivity and stability of the combined application of the MD
   algorithm and sudden onset and MD algorithm and stability were
   96.2\%/52.2\% and 94.4\%/ 63.8\%, respectively.
   The MD criterion in combination with other enhanced detection criteria
   might significantly improve specificity of tachyarryhthmia detection of

Abstract = {{The mechanochemical method was used for the synthesis of highly
   dispersed stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric LixMn2O4 spinel starting
   from different manganese (MnO2, Mn2O3, MnO) and lithium (LiOH, LiOH .
   H2O, Li2CO3) compounds. It is shown that the oxidation state of
   manganese greatly influences on the kinetics of mechanochemical
   reactions. On the other hand, different crystal structure and mechanical
   properties of initial lithium compounds result in different mechanisms
   of mechanochemical action on the activated mixtures. A strong effect of
   temperature and lithium content on the composition and lattice constant
   of the final products was found. Conductivity of LixMn2O4 spinels,
   measured by complex impedance spectroscopy, is likely caused by
   intergrain resistance. The activation energy of conductivity does not
   depend on x, the phase transition at 290+/-10 K, observed for
   stoichiometric spinel, is accompanied by a conductivity decrease. Test
   experiments in the electrochemical cell Li/LiPF6, EC/LiMn2O4,C
   demonstrate that lithium-manganese oxide obtained by the mechanochemical
   method is a promising cathode material for 4 V lithium batteries. (C)

Abstract = {{The blood-brain barrier is a major obstacle for the chemotherapeutic
   drugs to effectively reach primary or secondary brain tumours.
   Stealth(R) liposomal drugs are highly accumulated in tumoural tissues.
   In the present study we investigated the relative accumulation of
   Tc-99m-DTPA radiolabelled stealth(R) liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx(R))
   in 10 patients with metastatic brain tumours and five patients with
   brain glioblastoma undergoing radiotherapy. Patients with metastatic
   brain lesions were treated with 10 consecutive fractions of radiotherapy
   (whole brain, 3 Gy/fraction, day 1 -12) followed by a booster dose of 9
   Gy (3 Gy/fraction; day 21-23). Caelyx(R), at a dose of 25 mg mg(-2) was
   given on day 1 and on day 21. Radiolabelled Caelyx(R) accumulation was
   13-19 times higher in the glioblastomas and 7-13 times higher in the
   metastatic lesions, as compared to the normal brain. The drug
   accumulation in the tumoural areas was 40-60\% of the accumulation in
   the bone marrow of the skull bones. The normal brain radioactivity was
   <4\% of the bone marrow, confirming an important shielding effect of the
   blood-brain barrier in the normal but not in the tumoural tissue. Four
   of 10 patients with metastatic lesions showed a complete response in
   CT-scan performed 2 months following therapy. There was no severe
   toxicity related to radiotherapy or to chemotherapy noted. It is
   concluded that stealth(R) liposomal drugs selectively overcome the
   blood-brain barrier in the tumoural areas. The clinical importance of
   this observation is now under investigation. (C) 2000 Cancer Research

Abstract = {{A finite state automaton (FA) is a typical and basic machine for
   computer sciences and how to make the transition tables fast and compact
   is very important for the whole performance of modules by using the
   machine. Although a two-dimensional array and a list form are well known
   as for their representation, which have contrasted features for
   retrieval time and space efficiency. A.V. Aho and J.D. Ullman
   {[}Principles of Compiler Design, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1986, pp,
   74-118] proposed a triple-array method for combining the compactness of
   the list with the fast retrieval of the array, but there is no
   discussion to make the structure compact with;out degrading the fast
   retrieval. This paper proposes a method of compressing the triple-array
   structures. Although the approach is not optimal, it does realize a
   reasonable reduction in size. From the simulation results, it is
   verified that the presented method can produce fast and compact
   structures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear response of ferroelectric BaxSr1-xTiO3 films to microwave
   electric field intensity up to similar to 3x10(6) V/m was studied. Two
   techniques were used for this investigation: (i) 10 GHz pulsed power

   measurements. The nonlinear distortion of the resonant curve under
   microwave pulsed power and generation of the third-order IMD products in
   microwave resonators using ferroelectric film planar capacitors were
   measured. The use of microwave pulses and continuous signals enabled the
   separation of the nonlinear dielectric response from the heating
   response of the ferroelectric films and the microwave nonlinear
   parameters of the ferroelectric films to be determined. It is shown that
   up to a specified value of microwave voltage amplitude the nonlinear
   response of BaxSr1-xTiO3 film capacitors can be predicted from the small
   signal capacitance-voltage characteristics. Formulas to estimate power
   handling capability connected with the field dielectric nonlinearity and
   the film overheating are derived for the tunable microwave devices based

   contrasted with a natural soil and gravel for factors potentially
   limiting to growth Twelve individuals of five native species (big-leaf
   maple, western yarrow, Sitka alder, pearly everlasting, and fireweed)
   were grown in fire different field plots. Plots consisted of (i) copper
   mine failings, (ii) natural soil, (iii) 15 cm of gravel over tailings,
   (iv) biosolids plus wood chips with 15 cm gravel over tailings, and (v)
   gravel. Survival was highly variable by species and plot type, with
   highest survival among all species with pearly everlasting, and highest
   survival br treatment with the natura soil and biosolids pins wood chips
   with gravel over tailings. Treatments resulted in a significant
   difference (p = 0.05) in species biomass production, with the biosolids
   resulting in highest biomass in all species except big-leaf maple. Plant
   nutrient content was also higher with the biosolids, The tailings were
   extremely acidic and had high exchangeable Al. Sitka alder was most
   tolerant bf the tailings, despite high Al uptake, and,vas productive
   across all plot types, possibly due to its tolerance of metals and high

Abstract = {{Zeolitic materials are often used for the separation of hydrocarbon
   mixtures. In this paper we suggest a procedure for modelling the
   separation performance using a combination of two techniques:
   1. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations for estimating
   the required pure component and mixture isotherms, and
   2. Maxwell-Stefan formulation of mixture diffusion in zeolites.
   The applicability of the suggested approach is demonstrated by comparing
   the theoretical predictions with experimental data published on zeolite
   membrane permeation. The theory provides clues to the development of new
   separation techniques and also for optimisation of the operating
   conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Various linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE; density similar to
   (0.920 g/cm(3)) resins that encompass those polymerized using
   Ziegler-Natta, metallocene, and chromium oxide based catalysts were
   blown into film at similar process conditions, and the tensile
   properties of the resulting films were investigated in relation to their
   orientation characteristics. The tensile properties of the subject blown
   films were observed to be significantly different from those of
   isotropic/un-oriented polyethylene specimens of similar density
   (crystallinity). Further, the tensile properties were different in the
   machine and transverse directions. These were explained in terms of the
   orientation and lamellar organization characteristics of the LLDPE blown
   films. Investigation of the temperature dependence (between -50 degreesC
   and +50 degreesC) of these tensile properties indicated an increase in
   modulus, yield stress and break stress with decreasing temperature
   pointing to the possible role played by the decreased mobility of the
   non-crystalline phase at lower temperatures. Excellent correlation
   between the Elmendorf tear properties of the LLDPE blown films and their
   tensile yield characteristics was observed. This added substantial
   credibility to previous hypotheses that specimen stretching plays a
   significant role in Elmendorf tear tests and further supported the
   previously identified structural features and microstructural
   deformation mechanisms that are deemed responsible for the discernment
   of LLDPE blown film tear resistance.}},

Abstract = {{We report on high-resolution measurements of the coefficient of thermal
   expansion a of the heavy-fermion superconductor U1-xThxBe13 for
   temperatures 0.05 K less than or equal toT less than or equal to6 K and
   magnetic fields B less than or equal to8 T. Particular attention is paid
   to the properties of the low-temperature normal state and their
   evolution as a function of thorium concentration. By exploring a wide
   concentration range, 0 less than or equal tox less than or equal
   to0.052, that encompasses the region x(c1) =0.019<x<x(c2)=0.045 where
   temperature-dependent specific-heat measurements reveal two subsequent
   phase transitions at T-c1 > T-c2, our study discloses features in the
   T-x plane that have been overseen by all other techniques applied to
   this system so far: ii) The substitution of uranium by thorium in UBe13
   induces an anomaly that manifests itself in a negative at T)
   contribution to the low-temperature normal-state expansivity. Its
   distinct field dependence signals a magnetic origin. Analyzing the
   relative lengths changes associated with this anomaly and that of the
   phase transition at T-c2 suggests a common (presumably magnetic) nature
   of both features, iii) The linear concentration dependence of the second
   low-energy scale T-c2, which gives rise to a pronounced maximum in alpha
   (T) of UBe13 at 2 K (at B = 0) could be followed up-by applying a
   magnetic field-to concentrations x>0.03. Most remarkably, T-max(x)
   vanishes at x approximate to0.043, i.e., almost exactly at x(c2). (iii)
   Upon increasing x to above 0.03 the normal- to superconducting-state
   transition at T-c2 progressively loses its signatures in alpha Our
   measurements, together with recent specific-heat results by Schreiner et
   al. {[}Schreiner ct al., Europhys. Lett. 48, 568 (1999)] indicate that
   superconductivity becomes gapless for x-->x(c2). Hence, the phase
   transition seen in specific heat as well as thermal-expansion
   measurements for samples with x>x(c2) has to be attributed to the T-c2
   transition. Concomitant investigations of the ac susceptibility indicate
   that the normal- to superconducting-state transition for x>x(c2) now
   coincides with T-c2. As for the implications of our observations for the
   interpretation of the various low-temperature anomalies, we discuss two
   possible scenarios both of which imply an intimate interrelation of
   superconductivity with the symmetry broken state that forms below T-c2.}},
