Abstract = {{This paper describes theoretical modeling of electrostatic lenses based
   on three, four and five closely spaced cylindrical electrodes. In each
   case, modeling is carried out numerically using commercial packages
   SIMION and LENSYS, and a variety of performance parameters are obtained.
   Special cases such as a zoom lens (i.e., lenses whose magnification may
   be changed without losing focus) are considered. Results are obtained as
   a function of the ratios of the electrode lengths and gaps, and as a
   function of ratios of the controlling voltages. As a result, how a
   multi-element lens system can be operated with the whole focal
   properties in a useful mode for experimental studies is shown. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{This prospective study examined the yearly incidence of traumatic
   injuries to primary teeth. The aim of the study was to find out more
   about dental injuries to primary teeth in Norwegian children. The study
   was performed in one county of Norway involving approximately 20 000
   children in the age group 1-8 years. Twenty-seven public dental clinics
   and 42 dentists participated. The dentists attended information and
   calibration meetings and received illustrations of the classification of
   dental trauma as well as examples of how to fill in the forms correctly.
   Two hundred and sixty-six children were involved, including 447 primary
   teeth, recorded during a 1-year registration period (2003). The dental
   trauma incidence was 1.3\% with 3.5-year old being the most
   accident-prone. Boys were significantly more often injured than girls,
   164 versus 102 (P < 0.001). The upper central incisors were most
   involved (92\%), with a non-significant difference between the right and
   left side. The minor periodontal injuries dominated (59\%). Hard tissue
   injuries were far less frequent (13\%). Avulsions were observed in 6.5\%
   and intrusions in 7.5\% of the injured children, being 5.5\% and 5\% of
   the injured teeth. Most of the injuries occurred either at home (38\%)
   or at kindergarten (32\%). Sixty-two percentage were falling accidents
   often sustained during children's play, and 25\% were pure playing
   accidents.
   Conclusion: In Norwegian children aged 1-8 years, with a predominance of
   boys, the most common primary tooth injuries were minor luxations of the
   maxillary central incisors, sustained at an age of 3.5 years. As the
   traumas often occurred during children's play and/or were the
   consequence of falls, these are difficult to prevent. However, follow
   ups should be carried out to disclose pulpal or periodontal
   complications and/or developmental disturbances of the permanent
   successors.}},

Abstract = {{Major depression is a common illness, with a lifetime prevalence rate of
   10-13\% for men and 21-24\% for women. The experience of having a
   serious illness such as major depression affects the individual's
   quality of life and requires significant adaptation in order to cope.
   The aim of this study was to explore sense of coherence and social
   support in patients treated for a first episode of major depression in a
   1-year follow up. The study design was prospective and longitudinal. A
   total of 24 patients, aged 18 years or over, with a first episode of
   major depression were included. Semi-structured interviews and
   self-assessment questionnaires were used at baseline as well as in a
   1-year follow up in order to measure the level of severity of the
   depression, social support, and sense of coherence. The result showed
   that 71\% of the patients had recovered at follow up. The sense of
   coherence scores were low at baseline, although the patients who
   recovered increased their sense of coherence scores significantly.
   Another factor of importance for recovery was a significant increase in
   social support. Social support is an important cornerstone in the
   restoration of a person's sense of coherence. It can be used in
   interventions that include the patient's family or close social network
   in combination with support to assist the patient to view his/her
   situation as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful, thereby
   promoting or improving health. Mental health nurses are in a key
   position to identify patients' strengths and weaknesses so that the
   support and interventions provided can be tailored to meet the needs of
   each patient.}},

   transformation, achieving compression ratios higher by 2-6\% than the
   state-of-the-art StarNT (2003) text preprocessor, working at a greater

Abstract = {{The mechanisms that underlie sexual selection rely upon within- and
   among-individual variability in the targeted traits. In this study, we
   examined variation in the advertisement call of the booroolong frog
   (Litoria booroolongensis) at several different levels: between
   populations, between breeding seasons in the same population, among
   males within a population, within males between nights and within males
   in a single calling bout. The call of L. booroolongensis has multiple
   notes with a pulsed structure. We detected considerable variation in
   advertisement call structure between breeding seasons and between
   populations. The measured call properties ranged from static to dynamic;
   however, most properties were intermediate between the criteria that
   have been traditionally used to define call traits as static or dynamic
   (<= 5 and >= 12\% respectively). We compared actual and relative
   repeatabilities and found that the temporal call properties associated
   with the structure of the note had the highest values, suggesting that
   these characters in particular may respond to selection. We argue that
   relative repeatabilities are a particularly useful measure of the
   potential for evolutionary response to selection as they account for an
   individual's relative performance during the period of assessment in an
   ever-changing breeding arena.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Electrode-imbedded endotracheal tubes allow continuous
   intraoperative assessment of vocal cord function when connected to an
   electromyographic (EMG) response monitor. Whether this device enhances
   or hinders the identification and preservation of the recurrent
   laryngeal nerve (RLN) is unclear.
   Methods. The utility of continuous intraoperative neurophysiology
   testing (INT) of RLNs was evaluated prospectively in 100 patients
   undergoing 103 thyroid or parathyroid operations, involving 185 RLNs.
   The initial experience with 93 RLNs was compared with the subsequent 92
   RLNs.
   Results. Overall, 97.8\% of RLNs were identified intraoperatively: 1.6\%
   visually only, 2.2\%nerve stimulator only, and 94 \% both. There was 1
   transected RLN (1.1\%) in each study group. The EMG monitor could not
   alert the surgeon to prevent these injuries. Overall, there were 14
   instances Of nonfunction of visually intact RLNs (7.6\%), at some point
   during the operation and 4 resulting in temporary paralysis (2.2\%).
   There were 8 instances of altered RLN function (4.3\%) with no altered
   vocal cord function postoperatively. The nerve stimulator aided
   dissection of the RLN in 17 instances (9.2\%). There were 7 episodes
   (3.8\%) of equipment dysfunction that hampered surgical dissection.
   Between study groups there was significantly increased use of the nerve
   stimulator to first identify the location of the RLN before visual
   confirmation: 4 of 93, initial group versus 25 of 92, latter group (P <.
   001).
   Conclusions. INT aids the anatomic identification of the RLN only when a
   positive EMG response occurs. A negative EMG response can indicate a
   non-nerve structure, altered function of the RLN, or equipment setup
   malfunction. INT cannot necessarily prevent RLN transection.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Physicians are encouraged to provide counseling regarding
   parental discipline. Quality counseling requires knowledge of
   disciplinary practices and factors that affect these practices.
   Methods: One hundred and eighty two parents of 12- to 19-month-old
   children from general pediatric clinics in North Carolina and Alabama
   were inter-viewed regarding discipline using the Discipline Survey.
   Measures of contextual factors were analyzed to see which predicted
   disciplinary practices.
   Results: Ninety-two percent of the participants were mothers; 6\% were
   fathers; participation rate: 78\%. Monitoring was the most common type
   of discipline used and time out was the least common. Parent, child, and
   family characteristics were all importantly associated with a broad
   array of disciplinary practices and modes of administration. However,
   the situation in which discipline occurred was found to be significant
   for most disciplinary practices even after controlling for other
   factors. Our study found that the specific misbehavior was most likely,
   and the presence of the other parent was least likely, to affect the
   type of discipline which was utilize.
   Conclusions: When counseling families about discipline, practitioners
   should incorporate the fact that misbehavior happens in various
   contexts.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Human ABO-secretor locus (FUT2) is highly polymorphic in
   many human populations.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The applicability of denaturing
   high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis was evaluated
   for genotyping the FUT2 in two Sri Lankan populations (Tamil and
   Sinhalese).
   RESULTS: Although DHPLC failed to detect one allele, 302C > T, of eight
   alleles, this method reduces the number of samples to be sequenced and
   can detect novel polymorphisms by comparing the elution profiles.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that DHPLC analysis is a useful
   high-throughput method for genotyping FUT2 and, further, that the
   genetic backgrounds of two Sri Lankan populations are quite similar,
   with little genetic flow from neighboring East and Southeast Asian
   populations to Sri Lanka.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To document the presence and functioning of different
   practice systems in a small sample of medical groups in Minnesota and to
   examine the relationship between the presence of practice systems and
   prior adoption of an electronic medical record (EMR).
   Study Design: Descriptive study of the frequency of practice systems in
   11 medical groups.
   Methods: We recruited 11 medical groups for the study. Four groups had
   an EMR; the other groups used paper medical records, often supplemented
   by electronic ordering or data systems. Using an on-site audit team, we
   validated the presence of practice systems organized under 8 categories.
   Results: All of the medical groups had implemented a substantial number
   of practice systems for care management of patients with chronic
   conditions. Although the medical groups with an EMR tended to have more
   comprehensive practice systems in place, the medical groups without an
   EMR also had most of the practice svstems.
   Conclusions: Although required in some functions, an EMR may not be
   necessary in facilitating practice systems that support consistent
   management of patients with chronic illness. Approaches are needed that
   will encourage the implementation of practice systems in medical groups
   with and without an EMR.}},

   Fifteen variables were examined for their significance on PGA
   production. Among those variables, K2HPO4, KH2PO4, (NH4)(2)SO4 and
   casein hydrolysate were found to be the most significant variables that
   encourage PGA production. A correlation between cellular growth, PGA and
   the produced traces of polysaccharides was illustrated. An inverse
   relationship practice between cell dry weights and the produced PGA was
   demonstrated. On the other hand, a direct proportional relation was
   shown between polysaccharides on one side and cell dry weight and
   produced PGA on the other. The preoptimized medium, based on statistical
   analysis, showed a production of 33.5 g/l PGA, which is more than three

   proposes an effective and simple polling scheme to reduce the number of

Title = {{Gender identity and modern Slovenian novel}},
Journal = {{PRIMERJALNA KNJIZEVNOST}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{93-113}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Currently gender identity is more and more at the centre of issue of
   identity. In the scientific discourse it is embodied in the modem thesis
   of the gender theory thesis, in which gender is perceived as a
   construct, a continuously changing category and performance. Judith
   Butler, an important researcher of gender identity, suggests that all of
   us emulate ``our true sex{''}, convinced that we model ourselves on an
   original ideal, although the original itself is already a parody of the
   idea of the natural and original.
   Gender identity in the modem Slovenian novel of recent years (1990-2005)
   is x-rayed through the progress of a personal or intimate story, which
   is a shared characteristic of most recent Slovenian novels. Stories
   portray changes in gender identity through the binarism of the
   heterosexual matrix (issues of sexual minorities are very rare -
   homosexual themes appear in the novels Zgubljena zgodba ('The Lost
   Story), Angeli (Angels') and Ime mi je Damjan ('My Name Is Damjan) -
   while homosexual motifs are somewhat more common), which is questioned
   by stereotypes of femininity and masculinity: woman, the dark continent;
   woman, the angel in the house; woman, the femme fatale; and man, the Don
   Juan. The most prevalent is the first stereotype, which is also linked
   to the image of the femme fatale (e. g. in the novels Ki jo je megla
   prinesla (Brought by the Fog), Volcje noci ('The Nights of the Wolves),
   Kraljeva hci ('The King Daughter), Igra angelov in netopirjev ('The Game
   of Angels and Bats), Galilejev lestenec ('The Chandelier of Galileo),
   Carmen ('Carmen'), Tek za rdeco hudicevko (Running After the Red
   She-Devil), Kalipso ('Calypso')), where one can recognise the phantasm
   of the male erotic imagination, and, above all, the male literary
   character's fear of an individualist woman. In times of transformed
   gender roles, woman is no longer the angel in the house (e.g. Vladarka
   ('The Empress), Crni angel, varuh moj (My Black Guardian Angel), Tao
   ljubezni ('The Tao of Love), Noc v Evropi (A Night in Europe), Kalipso),
   but since she is dominated by the enigma of her own and the opposite
   sex, she becomes, in a world of ``empty existence{''}, a prisoner of her
   own freedom and her (still traditional) image of men.
   Two important innovations in the most recent Slovenian novels have to do
   with gender identity, which becomes (through a love story) the core of
   identity issues. The first innovation regards narrative: a higher
   percentage of leading female characters, also as a result of the greater
   number of female novelists, bring to the worlds of novels a diversity of
   gender perspective and motifs. If men experience female characters as a
   conjunction of too low (a woman as an instinctive and unequal being) and
   too high expectations (a woman as an ethereal, ideal being), female
   characters are more preoccupied with images of their own gender,
   although they are also interested in men, particularly as friends and
   lovers. The verbalisation of the inter-sexual communication barrier
   denotes a new type of honesty, in which becoming familiar with your own
   gender means being open to the other. When such an honesty exposes the
   repression of the heterosexual matrix with a humorous, ironic, or
   parodic distance, it tends towards a new emotionality, a particular
   emotional mood in texts characterised by the auto-reflexivity of its own
   (novelistic) sentiment and subtle intellectuality.}},

   Dynamics is used to examine differences in the patterns and determinants
   of residential mobility between high-poverty and lower-poverty
   neighborhoods among Latinos, blacks and Anglos. Householders of Mexican,
   Puerto Rican and Cuban origin are significantly less likely than Anglos
   to move from a high-poverty to a lower-poverty neighborhood, and these
   differences are only partially explained by ethnic differences in
   standard mobility determinants. Although African Americans are thought
   to face unique barriers to geographic mobility, Puerto Ricans and
   Mexicans are significantly less likely than non-Hispanic blacks to
   escape high-poverty neighborhoods. Mexicans and Puerto Ricans are
   significantly more likely than Anglos to move from a lower-poverty to a
   high-poverty neighborhood, but blacks exhibit by far the highest rates
   of moving into high-poverty neighborhoods.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of a common mycorrhizal network implies that the arrangement
   of plants and mycorrhizal fungi in a community shares properties with
   other networks. A network is a system of nodes connected by links. Here
   we apply network theory to mycorrhizas to determine whether the
   architecture of a potential common mycorrhizal network is random or
   scale-free. We analyzed mycorrhizal data from an oak woodland from two
   perspectives: the phytocentric view using trees as nodes and fungi as
   links and the mycocentric view using fungi as nodes and trees as links.
   From the phytocentric perspective, the distribution of potential
   mycorrhizal links, as measured by the number of ectomycorrhizal
   morphotypes on trees of Quercus garryana, was random with a short tail,
   implying that all the individuals of this species are more or less equal
   in linking to fungi in a potential network. From the mycocentric
   perspective, however, the distribution of plant links to fungi was
   scale-free, suggesting that certain fungus species may act as hubs with
   frequent connections to the network. Parallels exist between social
   networks and mycorrhizas that suggest future lines of study on
   mycorrhizal networks.}},

   length at sexual maturity (118 mm for the combined sexes, 112 mm for
   males and 118 mm for females), frequency distributions for total length,
   length-weight relationship (Wt = 0,0000003 x Lt(3,6708)), sex ratio,
   seasonal variation of the gonad maturation stages, gonadosomatic index,
   condition factor, somatic condition factor, reproductive cycle and
   timing of spawning. Ichthyoplankton samples were also examined in order
   to verify the sharing of this species in such samples. It was determined
   correlations between biological and environmental parameters, such as,
   surface and bottom temperature, and salinity in the water column. The

Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{876-884}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cover provides shelter, food, nesting opportunities and protection from
   predators. The behavioural response of small mammals to reduced cover
   has been well documented. However, very little is known about the effect
   of cover on community and population dynamics. Australian small mammals
   generally inhabit extremely dynamic ecosystems, where cover and food
   supplies are greatly affected by fire. Species are described as early or
   late seral specialists, generally returning to a disturbed area once
   their habitat requirements are met. Habitat requirements have loosely
   been interpreted as cover and food supply, however, these factors are
   not mutually exclusive and few studies have attempted to determine the
   driving factors behind small mammal succession. In this study, we
   manipulated specific aspects of cover in the eucalypt forests of Fraser
   Island and show that the behaviour and population dynamics of small
   mammals were greatly affected. A reduction of cover from grass-trees
   (Xanthorrhoea johnsonii) did not affect small mammal species
   composition, however, the abundance and size structure distribution of
   the dominant species (Rattus fuscipes) decreased. Patch use by rodents
   also decreased after cover was reduced. Rattus fuscipes must trade-off
   remaining in an environment with increased risk of predation, or
   disperse to an area with greater cover but increased competition.
   Juveniles dominated (> 60\%) populations of R. fuscipes after cover was
   reduced, however, size distributions of control sites were relatively
   more even (< 25\% juvenile). While adult R. fuscipes are either killed
   by predators or disperse to other areas, juveniles that remained or
   immigrated to an area of reduced cover gained a selective advantage over
   those in control sites, because reduced competition with adults
   increased body condition of juvenile R. fuscipes.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the complement system's involvement in many human diseases
   and potential complications associated with its systemic blockade,
   site-specific regulation of this effector system is an attractive
   concept. We report on further developments of such an approach using a
   single-chain Ab fragment as a vehicle to deliver complement regulatory
   proteins to a defined cell type. In a model system in which RBCs
   deficient in complement receptor 1-related gene/protein y (Crry) are
   rapidly cleared after injection into wild-type animals by a
   complement-dependent mechanism, we selectively reconstituted these cells
   with N- and C-terminally targeted recombinant forms of Crry. Transfusion
   of Crry-coated knockout RBCs into C57BL/6 mice extended their in vivo
   half-life from < 5 min to -2 days. Maintenance of protective levels of
   Crry (by a combined treatment of donor and recipient RBCs) led to nearly
   normal RBC survival. Uniform in vitro and in vivo coating of the RBCs
   and the more efficient complement inhibitory capacity of C-terminally
   tagged Crry were other interesting features of this experimental system.
   These results suggest the possibility of using the single-chain Ab
   fragment-mediated targeting concept of complement regulatory proteins to
   restrict complement inhibition to the site of its excessive activation.}},

Abstract = {{Background GW320659, a highly selective neuronal norepinephrine and
   dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, has been evaluated for the treatment of
   obesity. Scrutiny of the weight loss data from a phase 11 study
   (GlaxoSmithKline study OBS20001) showed a wide variation in weight loss
   response following GW320659 treatment and the possibility that the study
   population might include subgroups with enhanced weight loss response.
   Methods Pharmacogenetic analysis was performed in 191 subjects
   prospectively ascertained from a Phase 11 dose ranging study to evaluate
   the influence of genotype on weight loss efficacy and safety of GW320659
   in obese subjects.
   Results Common genetic polymorphisms in the drug target (norepinephrine
   transporter protein 1, SLC6A2) and mechanism pathway (NMDA receptor
   channel NR1 subunit, GRIN1) were associated with increased weight loss
   following GW320659 treatment in a proportion (36\%) of the study
   population. In the patient subgroup selected for these genotypes,
   GW320659 (15 mg/day) produced a significant difference in mean weight
   loss of 7.84 kg (SD 5.23, n=14), compared to 2.53kg (SD 5.17, n=24) in
   the subgroup that did not possess the genotypes (P=0.006). This subgroup
   also showed a highly significant weight loss Introduction Patient
   response to pharmacotherapy is variable with even the most widely used
   drugs achieving adequate response in only a proportion of the patient
   population {[}I]. There is increasing evidence that a large proportion
   of the variation in drug response is the consequence of genetic
   variation in the Population {[}2-4]{[} and an individual's genetic
   composition may impact medicine response or clinical Outcome {[}5-7].
   Pharmacogenetics L, (PGx) is the study of variability in medicine
   response in,groups of individuals due to hereditary factors. Defining
   the variation in genes that correlate to subject's response or adverse
   reaction to a particular medication will allow for more accurate
   targeting of treatments to appropriate subject Populations. In addition,
   PGx analysis of clinical trial data may allow stratification or
   selection of the population into groups most likely to respond to and/or
   response for GW320659 compared to placebo (+0.31 kg, SD 3.32, n=16) with
   the same genotypes (P<0.0001). In addition, there was no difference in
   placebo response between either subgroup.
   Conclusions Polymorphisms in SLC6A2 and GRIN1 could be used to maximize
   effective obesity pharmacotherapy by norepinephrine/dopamine transporter
   inhibitors by identifying patients that may be predisposed to
   particularly good treatment weight loss response.}},

   self-adaptation of evolution parameters and with some other improvements
   it can monitor and adjust its own behavior. The algorithm's capability
   to self-adapt to a given problem is used as a measure to predict if some

   Recordings were made from 74 STN cells which fired action potentials at

   increased STN neurone firing rate (10 mu M, 180 +/- 16.8\%, n = 35) with

   with the specific 5-HT2C receptor antagonist RS102221 (500 nM, 9 cells)
   and the 5HT(4) antagonist GR113808 (500 nM, 7 cells). In 6 cells (8\%)
   5-HT induced biphasic responses where excitation was followed by
   inhibition, while in 7 cells (9\%) inhibition of firing rate was
   observed alone. Inhibitory responses were reduced by the 5-HT1A
   antagonist WAY100135 (1 mu M, 4 cells). No inhibitory responses were
   observed following alpha-methyl 5-HT applications. Both the excitations
   and inhibitions were unaffected by picrotoxin (50 mu M, n = 5) and CNQX
   (10 mu M, n = 5) indicative of direct postsynaptic effects. Thus, in STN
   neurones, 5-HT elicits two distinct effects, at times on the same
   neurone, the first being an excitation which is mediated by 5-HT2C and
   5-HT4 receptors and the second an inhibition which is mediated by 5-HT1A
   receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is a general lack of genomic information available for chlorophyte
   seaweed genera such as Ulva, and in particular there is no information
   concerning the genes that contribute to adhesion and cell wall
   biosynthesis for this organism. Partial sequencing of cDNA libraries to
   generate expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is an effective means of gene
   discovery and characterization of expression patterns. In this study, a
   cDNA library was created from sporulating tissue of Ulva linza L.
   Initially, 650 ESTs were randomly selected from a cDNA library and
   sequenced from their 5' ends to obtain an indication of the level of
   redundancy of the library (21\%). The library was normalized to enrich
   for rarer sequences, and a further 1920 ESTs were sequenced. These
   sequences were subjected to contig assembly that resulted in a unigene
   set of approximately 1104 ESTs. Forty-eight percent of these sequences
   exhibited significant similarity to sequences in the databases.
   Phylogenetic comparisons are made between selected sequences with
   similarity in the databases to proteins involved in aspects of
   extracellular matrix/cell wall assembly and adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{Juveniles within the youth justice system have high rates of psychiatric
   morbidity, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This case
   series describes 6 young people aged 15 to 17 years within a youth
   detention center who met the criteria for PTSD and reported an
   improvement in symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment with low-dose
   quetiapine. The primary outcome measure used was the Traumatic Symptom
   Checklist in Children. The dose of quetiapine ranged from 50 to 200
   mg/d; T scores for PTSD symptoms decreased from 75 (SD, +/- 5.2; range,
   68-82) to 54 (SD: +/- 7.4; range, 43-62) (P <= 0.01). Significant
   improvements in symptoms of dissociation (P <= 0.01), anxiety (P <
   0.01), depression (P < 0.01).. and anger (P < 0.05) were also noted over
   the 6-week evaluation period. Low-dose quetiapine was tolerated well,
   with no persisting side effects or adverse events. Nighttime sedation
   was reported, although this was viewed as beneficial. All young people
   opted to continue with treatment after the assessment period. This
   preliminary case series suggests that juveniles in detention who have
   PTSD may benefit from treatment with quetiapine. Caution is needed in
   interpreting these findings. Both larger open-label and blinded trials
   are war-ranted to define the use of quetiapine in the treatment of PTSD
   in the adolescent forensic population.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of two formulations of microencapsulated pheromone
   (CheckMate CM-F), containing 14.3\% (E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol
   (codlemone), on the behaviour of the male codling moth, Cydia pomonella
   (L.), were evaluated in a flight tunnel after several periods of
   formulation ageing. The two treatments of CheckMate CM-F evaluated
   consisted of the label-recommended field rate of 50 g active ingredient
   (a.i.)/ha diluted in: (1) a standard 1000 l of water (low concentration
   0.05 g/l), and (2) a low volume of 100 l of water (high concentration
   0.5 g/l). The low-concentration treatment was formulated by diluting
   0.071 ml of CheckMate CM-F in 500 ml of water and the high-concentration
   treatment contained 0.71 ml of CheckMate CM-F in 500 ml of water.
   Wax-paper strips (2.1 x 20 cm) were treated at 0.06 ml of
   solution/cm(2). The mean (+/- SE) number of CheckMate CM-F microcapsules
   adhering to treated wax-paper strips in the high-concentration treatment
   (398 +/- 38) was sevenfold greater than that (57 +/- 5) counted on
   wax-paper strips treated with the low concentration. Both low- and
   high-concentration treatments prevented anemotactic orientation of male
   codling to an adjacent 0.1 mg codlemone lure for up to 24 h after
   application. These moths flew out of the release cages, but exhibited
   erratic and short flights not restricted to any plume and ending at the
   tunnel walls or the floor. This occurred with approximately 60 and 400
   microcapsules per wax-paper strip in the low- and high-concentration
   treatments, releasing codlemone at approximately 0.15 and 1.5 mu g/h
   respectively. After 2 days of ageing, the low-concentration treatment no
   longer interfered with the ability of males to find the codlemone lure.
   However, the number of males contacting the lure was significantly
   reduced for up to 6 days with the high-concentration treatment relative
   to the control and low-concentration treatments. The high-concentration
   treatment no longer impeded normal orientational flight after 2-6 days
   of ageing; but, it diverted males from the codlemone lure by causing
   them to land on the adjacent treated wax-paper strips. This occurred at
   a release rate of approximately 0.7 mu g codlemone/h from approximately
   400 microcapsules per wax-paper strip distributed as clumps of
   approximately 30 microcapsules per 14 mm(2). We suggest that an initial
   but short-lived disruption mechanism like camouflage is followed by a
   longer period of false-plume following to clumps of microcapsules. The
   low-volume, concentrated application method for disseminating pheromone
   microcapsules warrants further investigation for moth codling, as well
   as other pests because this approach may improve the efficacy without
   the need for increasing the field application rate.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Some experimental whiplash investigations using human
   volunteers and full-body cadavers reported thoracic ramping,
   characterized by superior translation and extension rotation of the
   cervico-thoracic junction. The effect of this phenomenon on cervical
   spinal kinematics has not been quantitatively determined.
   Methods. A comprehensively validated computational model exercised in
   2.7 m/s rear impact was used to determine effects of superior
   translation and extension rotation of T1 on cervical segmental
   kinematics during the retraction phase.
   Findings. In general, thoracic ramping had a minimal effect on cervical
   intervertebral kinematics during retraction.
   Interpretation. Results of the present study demonstrated that magnitude
   of thoracic ramping plays a minimal role in the whiplash injury
   mechanism due to decreased effect on cervical segmental kinematics. (c)

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to report on the serum prolactin levels in 70
   male youths at a residential treatment center who were treated with
   either risperidone or quetiapine. This is a cross-sectional
   retrospective medical chart review of 50 males (mean age, 13.5 +/- 2.8
   years) treated with risperidone (mean dose, 2.4 +/- 1.6 mg/day) and 20
   males (mean age, 13.5 2.4 years) treated with quetiapine (mean dose,
   317.5 +/- 238 mg/day). Serum prolactin levels were drawn according to a
   protocol, after at least 6 weeks of treatment. Prolactin was above the
   upper limit of normal for 68\% of the patients on risperidone and 20\%
   of the patients on quetiapine (chi(2) analysis: R > Q; p < 0.001). Both
   risperidone and quetiapine produced dose-related increases in serum
   prolactin levels (R, r = 0.34, p = 0.017; Q, r = 0.45, p = 0.05). No
   correlation was found between duration of treatment and prolactin
   levels. Given that hyperprolactinemia secondary to antipsychotic
   treatment may result in reproductive and growth irregularities, periodic
   long-term monitoring during treatment with these two atypical
   antipsychotics (and perhaps others as well) may be warranted.}},

Title = {{Proposed mechanism for learning and memory erasure in a
   white-noise-driven sleeping cortex}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the structure and purpose of sleep remains one of the
   grand challenges of neurobiology. Here we use a mean-field linearized
   theory of the sleeping cortex to derive statistics for synaptic learning
   and memory erasure. The growth in correlated low-frequency
   high-amplitude voltage fluctuations during slow-wave sleep (SWS) is
   characterized by a probability density function that becomes broader and
   shallower as the transition into rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep is
   approached. At transition, the Shannon information entropy of the
   fluctuations is maximized. If we assume Hebbian-learning rules apply to
   the cortex, then its correlated response to white-noise stimulation
   during SWS provides a natural mechanism for a synaptic weight change
   that will tend to shut down reverberant neural activity. In contrast,
   during REM sleep the weights will evolve in a direction that encourages
   excitatory activity. These entropy and weight-change predictions lead us
   to identify the final portion of deep SWS that occurs immediately prior
   to transition into REM sleep as a time of enhanced erasure of labile
   memory. We draw a link between the sleeping cortex and Landauer's
   dissipation theorem for irreversible computing {[}R. Landauer, IBM J.
   Res. Devel. 5, 183 (1961)], arguing that because information erasure is
   an irreversible computation, there is an inherent entropy cost as the
   cortex transits from SWS into REM sleep.}},

Title = {{The mitotic exit network Mob1p-Dbf2p kinase complex localizes to the

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitotic exit network (MEN) is a conserved
   signaling network that coordinates CDK inactivation, cytokinesis and G1
   gene transcription. The MEN Cdc14p phosphatase is sequestered in the
   nucleolus and transiently released in early anaphase and telophase.
   Cdc14p mediates mitotic exit by dephosphorylating Cd14p substrates and
   promoting Cdk1p inactivation. Cdc14p also regulates the localization of
   chromosomal passenger proteins, which redistribute from kinetochores to
   the mitotic spindle during anaphase. Here we present evidence that the
   MEN protein kinase complex Mob1p-Dbf2p localizes to mitotic nuclei and
   partially colocalizes with Cdc14p and kinetochore proteins. Chromatin
   immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments reveal that Mob1p, Dbf2p, and
   Cdc14p associate with centromere DNA and require the centromere binding
   protein Ndc10p for this association. We establish that Mob1p is
   essential for maintaining the localization of Aurora, INCENP, and
   Survivin chromosomal passenger proteins on anaphase spindles, whereas
   Cdc14p and the Mob1p-Dbf2p-activating kinase Cdc15p are required for
   establishing passenger protein localization on the spindle. Moreover,
   Mob1p, but not Cdc15p, is required for dissociating Aurora from the
   kinetochore region. These findings reveal kinetochores as sites for MEN
   signaling and implicate MEN in coordinating chromosome segregation
   and/or spindle integrity with mitotic exit and cytokinesis via
   regulation of chromosome passenger proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Applications that require real-time processing of high-volume data
   steams are pushing the limits of traditional data processing
   infrastructures. These stream-based applications include market feed
   processing and electronic trading on Wall Street, network and
   infrastructure monitoring fraud detection, and command and control in

   its state or location in real time. This sensorization of the real world
   will lead to a ``green field{''} of novel monitoring and control
   applications with high-volume and low-latency processing requirements.
   Recently, several technologies have emerged - including-off-the-shelf
   stream processing engines specifically to address the challenges of
   processing high-volume, real-time data without requiring the use of
   custom code. At the same time, some existing software technologies; such

   In this paper, we outline eight requirements that a system software
   should meet to excel at a variety of real-time stream processing
   applications. Our goal is to provide high-level guidance to information
   technologists so that they will know what to look for when evaluation
   alternative stream processing solutions. As such, this paper serves a
   purpose comparable to the requirements papers in relational DBMSs and
   on-line analytical processing. We also briefly review alternative system
   software technologies in the context of our requirements.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The fluid recommendation for adults aged 70+ years has been
   criticised on the basis of a low prevalence of dehydration in
   community-dwelling older adults. This study explores whether the low
   prevalence might reflect limitations of individual dehydration indices.
   Design: Cross-sectional data on plasma sodium, blood urea nitrogen
   (BUN), creatinine, glucose and potassium were used to classify 1737
   participants of the 1992 Established Populations for Epidemiologic
   Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) (70+ years) according to multiple
   dehydration indices. Associations between dehydration indices, health
   and functional status were evaluated.
   Results: Depending on the indicator used, the prevalence of dehydration
   ranged from 0.5\% for hypotonic hypovolaemia only (plasma tonicity < 285
   mOsm l(-1) with orthostatic hypotension) to 60\% with dehydration
   defined as either plasma sodium g145 mEq l(-1), BUN/creatinine ratio
   g20, tonicity g295 mOsm l(-1), or hypotonic hypovolaemia. Elevated
   tonicity and BUN/creatinine ratio were respectively associated with
   chronic disease and functional impairment.
   Conclusions: The true prevalence of dehydration among community-dwelling
   adults may be low or high, depending on the indicator(s) used to define
   dehydration. Before we can pinpoint a generalisable prevalence of
   dehydration for community-dwelling seniors and draw conclusions about
   fluid recommendations, validation studies of dehydration indices and
   longitudinal studies of dehydration, health and functional status are
   needed.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{40}},
Pages = {{7789-7806}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An inventory of mercury emissions from anthropogenic activities in China
   is compiled for the year 1999 from official statistical data. We
   estimate that China's emissions were 536 (+/- 236) t of total mercury.
   This value includes open biomass burning, but does not include natural
   sources or re-emission of previously deposited mercury. Approximately
   45\% of the Hg comes from non-ferrous metals smelting, 38\% from coal
   combustion, and 17\% from miscellaneous activities, of which battery and
   fluorescent lamp production and cement production are the largest.
   Emissions are heaviest in Liaoning and Guangdong Provinces, where
   extensive smelting occurs, and in Guizhou Province, where there is much
   small-scale combustion of high-Hg coal without emission control devices.
   Emissions are gridded at 30 x 30 min spatial resolution. We estimate
   that 56\% of the Hg in China is released as Hg-0, 32\% as Hg2+, and 12\%
   as Hg-P. Particulate mercury emissions are high in China due to heavy
   burning of coal in residential and small industrial settings without PM
   controls. Emissions of Hg2+ from coal-fired power plants are high due to
   the absence of flue-gas desulfurization units, which tend to dissolve
   the soluble divalent mercury. Metals smelting operations favor the
   production of elemental mercury. Much of the Hg is released from
   small-scale activities in rather remote areas, and therefore the
   activity levels are quite uncertain. Also, emissions test data for
   Chinese sources are lacking, causing uncertainties in Hg emission
   factors and removal efficiencies. Overall, we calculate an uncertainty
   level of +/- 44\% (95\% confidence interval) in the estimate of total
   emissions. We recommend field testing of coal combustors and smelters in
   China to improve the accuracy of these estimates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Objective To identify important food sources of energy, fiber, and major
   macro- and micronutrients among rural Native American and white
   children.
   Design In a 1997 cross-sectional study, food frequency questionnaire
   data were collected during in-person interviews with caregivers of young
   children.
   Subjects/setting Participants included a representative sample of 329
   rural Native American and non-Hispanic white children aged 1 through 6
   years living in northeastern Oklahoma.
   Statistical analyses The percentage that each of 85 food items
   contributed to the population intake of 10 dietary constituents was
   calculated for the total sample and by age and race/ethnicity.
   Percentages are presented in descending rank order for foods providing
   at least 2\% of the total sample intake. Z scores were used to assess
   age and racial/ethnic differences in food sources.
   Results Primary energy sources among study children were milk, cheese,
   white breads, salty snacks, nondiet soft drinks, hot dogs, candy, and
   sweetened fruit drinks. Diets showed poor food variety. With few
   exceptions (eg, milk, cheese, 100\% orange juice, ready-to-eat cereals,
   peanuts/peanut butter, and dried beans), top sources of most dietary
   constituents were low-nutrient-dense high-fat foods and refined
   carbohydrates. Solid fruits and vegetables contributed minimally to
   nutrient and fiber intake. There were few differences in food sources by
   age or race/ethnicity.
   Conclusions Among rural Native American and white children in
   northeastern Oklahoma, food sources of nutrients appear less healthful
   than found in national samples. Sugar-sweetened beverages, high-fat
   foods, and refined carbohydrates are displacing more nutrient-dense
   alternatives, increasing children's risk for childhood obesity, type 2
   diabetes, and adult chronic disease.}},

   polytraumatized patients recorded between May 2003 and June 2004 for
   bicycle-related injuries. Of 153 polytraumatized patients treated in our
   emergency room 32 were cyclists (21 \%). The average age of our
   polytraumatized cyclist was 42 years, and the male-to-female ratio was
   1:1.
   Results. The median score on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) after the
   accident was 8 (min. 3, max. 15), the median Injury Severity Score (ISS)
   was 24 (min. 18, max. 41), and the median Polytrauma Score (PTS) was 23
   (min. 14, max. 51). A total of 30 patients (94\%) suffered a head
   injury; in 28 patients (88\%) the head injury was the leading diagnosis.
   The median score on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) Head was 4 (min.
   1, max. 5), the AIS Thorax 3 (min. 2, max. 4), and the AIS Extremities 3
   (min, 2, max. 5). Our data were also compared with the official injury
   statistics of the region and the current literature.
   Conclusion. The most frequent and most severe injury was the head injury
   (94\%). Of the 32 polytraumatized cyclists 30 did not wear a helmet.
   Successful prevention could possibly be practiced if all cyclists wear
   helmets.}},

Abstract = {{In real world applications, the databases are constantly added with a

   commonly seen in real world applications. In addition, several methods

   this paper, a fuzzy data mining algorithm for incremental mining of
   sequential patterns from quantitative databases is proposed. Proposed
   algorithm called IQSP algorithm uses the fuzzy grid notion to generate
   fuzzy sequential patterns validated on the updated database containing
   the transactions in the original database and in the incremental
   database. It uses the information about sequential patterns that are
   already mined from original database and avoids start-from-scratch

Abstract = {{As a topic in international relations (IR), morality seems to have all
   but gone the way of Wilsonian idealism. The rise to the fore of realist
   ontologies in IR, along with the secure epistemological position that
   positivism and scientific realism hold across the social sciences, have
   meant that ethical issues have been associated more with evaluation than
   explanation. With some notable exceptions, the result has been that the
   topic of ethics-explicit consideration by international actors or
   scholars of what constitutes right and wrong-has been neglected by
   mainstream IR. Where scholars do engage in normative theory, the
   directives are usually intended to fulfill strategic imperatives rather
   than philosophical ideals. Yet ignoring the constitutive role of
   morality and ethics in structuring policy choices leaves us without a
   complete understanding of the origins and consequences of international
   behavior. Whether state and non-state actors consciously make decisions
   to satisfy moral imperatives, and whether ethics cause action, ethics
   are-at minimum-an important permissive condition for security outcomes.
   While recent scholarship has indeed begun to reengage the relationship
   between morality and national interests, more work remains to be done in
   identifying different types of morality and the various ways in which
   ethics shape policymaking.(1) Accordingly, this article seeks to
   transplant the role of ethics from the realm of evaluative theory to
   empirical theory while attempting a more systematic investigation of
   ethics in security policy. To do so, the article introduces the idea of
   a security ethic. This notion refers to the state's-and by extension the
   military's-normative attitudes toward the use of organized violence,
   including under what circumstances militaries deem it ethically
   permissible to use force at all, and the manner in which force can be
   justly employed in a given military operation.(2) These ideas parallel
   the just war tenets of jus ad bellum (just cause) and jus in bello (just
   conduct), but refer to the military's own ethical conception of cause
   and conduct, rather than to a universally codified set of moral or legal
   criteria.(3) I will argue that understanding the sources and nature of
   security ethics in general, and uncovering these tendencies in
   particular cases, can help us explain and predict the emergence of
   particular strategic cultures and, to a lesser extent, military
   doctrines, as well as collective reactions to state policies.
   To uncover the nature of a given state's security ethic, the article
   brings to light two issues. The first explains variation in types of
   security ethics, and the second encapsulates the intensity with which a
   security ethic circulates within the consciousness of elites and masses.
   The type of security ethic hinges on what we might call the ``politics
   of choice{''} in defining that military's missions; that is, the degree
   of agency that the military perceives itself to possess vis-a-vis its
   adversaries, particularly regarding war's cause and its conduct.(4)
   Whether elites see wars as foisted upon the state by its enemies-as well
   as the nature of combat required by these missions-suggests a particular
   type of security ethic, including when and how battles may be
   legitimately fought. Examining the discourse within a given state
   surrounding issues of war and peace helps us understand whether a
   state's leaders and citizens see themselves as initiating wars or
   responding to the aggression of others. Yet polities are not monolithic,
   and a ``no-choice{''} view of war and peace may also furnish leaders
   with implicit ideological backing for their decisions, since, as Efraim
   Inbar has shown, the label is ultimately a disingenuous one.(5) As with
   many discursive labels, the no-choice category is therefore more
   political than analytically neutral.
   Moreover, while all militaries can be understood to entertain some
   ethical notions regarding the use of force, not all militaries prize
   ethics to the same extent. We can therefore understand security ethics
   as varying not only in type but in degree. To illustrate this, the
   article draws on a dichotomy that constructivists in IR have introduced
   to represent the range of decision styles that obtain in the
   international system: a logic of anticipated consequences versus a logic
   of appropriateness. A logic of consequences, as James G. March and Johan
   P. Olsen argue, refers to a tendency by actors to choose among
   alternatives ``by evaluating their likely consequences for personal or
   collective objectives, conscious that other actors are doing
   likewise.{''}(6) Conversely, a logic-of-appropriateness decision style
   stresses the role of actors' own identities, and the rules and norms
   that permeate the given system, in shaping decision outcomes. In this
   mode of decision-making, ``{[}h]uman actors are imagined to follow rules
   that associate particular identities to particular situations,
   approaching individual opportunities for action by assessing
   similarities between current identities and choice dilemmas.{''}(7)
   While constructivists have introduced these two decision styles
   primarily as a way to determine which ontology-an instrumentalist or
   social one-prevails in the international system, we can think of states
   as varying along this continuum, just as some strains of personality
   theory recognize that individuals differ from one another in their mode
   of decision-making.(8) We might therefore expect that a state which
   makes security decisions primarily according to a logic of consequences
   can be seen to give rise to a less ``ethically informed{''} military,
   while a logic-of-appropriateness style corresponds with a military that
   is more ethically informed. However, it is possible that states might
   vary along this continuum at different times and with respect to
   different sorts of policy issues, a claim that suggests the need to
   continue this investigation across cases and across time. It is also
   important to note that ``ethically informed{''} does not prejudge the
   nature of the values that are being professed, and hence a ``highly{''}
   ethically informed military does not necessarily imply restraint or
   adherence to any particular system-wide norms, such as those associated
   with just war theory or international law. Instead, to determine the
   content of the espoused ethic we must refer back to the
   politics-of-choice aspect, since ultimately actors possess different
   versions of morality.(9) Therefore, even norms-which by definition are
   collectively held ideas about what is normal-can be internalized
   differently by different actors, and identity can serve as a powerful
   lens for interpreting the meaning of a norm by a given actor. This
   dichotomy is explored further below.
   By way of illuminating the theory presented here, the second half of
   this article examines the security ethic of the Israel Defense Forces
   (IDF), and is presented more as a plausibility probe than as a
   definitive test of the theory per se.(10) As we will see, the IDF's
   security ethic hinges on two narrative tropes: the idea of fighting only
   wars of no choice (ayn breirah) while employing purity of arms (tohar
   haneshek). Wars of no choice, those that are fought to stave off
   national extinction, correspond to the philosophical idea of just cause.
   Purity of arms refers to using force only in the service of defense, and
   without the targeting of civilians; this law of discrimination is a
   central tenet of just conduct. This narrative combination in the Israeli
   case has given rise to a high security ethic premised on the politics of
   no choice with regard to cause, and choice with regard to the way that
   combat is carried out, signifying that the polity is poised to critique
   both the nature of military missions from their outset and the conduct
   of military actions once a given mission is in place. Moreover, the case
   of the IDF represents a striking puzzle, in that while Israel's doctrine
   is offensive, it understands its own grand strategic goals to be
   defensive.}},

   We demonstrate that the antimicrobial action of the thiamine analog

   bacteria and fungi. For example, pyrithiamine pyrophosphate (PTPP) binds
   the TPP riboswitch controlling the tenA operon in Bacillus subtilis.
   Expression of a TPP riboswitch-regulated reporter gene is reduced in
   transgenic B. subtilis or Escherichia coli when grown in the presence of

   unresponsive to these ligands. Bacteria selected for PT resistance bear
   specific mutations that disrupt ligand binding to TPP riboswitches and

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. Reactive oxygen species are involved in many of the
   angiotensin II signalling pathways. We have thus investigated whether
   the angiotensin II type 1 ( AT1) receptor antagonist, telmisartan, can
   inhibit the accelerated renal fibrosis and excess oxidative stress,
   which occurs after unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO) in
   acatalasemic mice.
   Methods. The effect of daily intraperitoneal injection of telmisartan (
   0.1 - 0.3 mg/kg body weight) on the renal tubulointerstitial injury
   induced by UUO has been studied in homozygous acatalasemic mutant mice (
   C3H/AnLCs(b)Cs(b)) and wild-type mice ( C3H/ AnLCs(a)Cs(a)). We
   evaluated the systemic blood pressure of the mice on the seventh day. In
   addition, the tubulointerstitial expression of collagens type I and type
   IV, the p22-, p47- and p67-phox subunits of NADPH oxidase,
   4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal lipid peroxidation products
   were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The level of apoptosis was
   determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end-labelling
   analysis, while the mRNA level of the p22-, p47- and p67-phox subunits
   was quantified by real-time PCR. The renal content of each of the
   antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide
   dismutase was determined by specific assay.
   Results. Obstructed kidneys from acatalasemic mice exhibited increased
   tubulointerstitial deposition in dilated tubules of collagens type I and
   IV, lipid peroxidation products, and the p22/p47/p67-phox subunits of
   NADPH oxidase. The level of the p22/p47/p67-phox subunit mRNA, and of
   apoptosis in tubular epithelial cells, was also increased compared with
   those from wild-type kidneys. Treatment with telmisartan attenuated all
   of the changes and prevented renal fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner;
   despite the low dose (0.1 mg/kg). The treatment did not lower the
   systemic blood pressure. The catalase activity remained low in
   acatalasemic obstructed kidneys without compensatory upregulation of
   glutathione peroxidase or superoxide dismutase activity; the level of
   neither anti-oxidant enzymes in obstructed kidneys was affected by
   telmisartan.
   Conclusions. The AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan ameliorated renal
   fibrosis after UUO by inhibition of oxidative stress, even under
   acatalasemic conditions.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{As competition in business-to-consumer e-commerce becomes fiercer,
   Web-based stores are attempting to attract consumers' attention by
   exploiting state-of-the-art technologies. Vitrual-reality (VR) on the
   Internet has been gaining prominence recently because it enables
   consumers to experience products realistically over the Internet, there-
   by mitigating the problems associated with consumers' lack of physical
   contact with products. However, while the employment of VR has increased
   in B2C e-commerce, its impact has not been explored extensively by
   research in the IS field.
   This study investigates whether and under what circumstances VR enhances
   consumer learning about products. In general, VR enables consumers to
   learn about products thoroughly by providing high-quality
   three-dimensional images of products, interactivity with the products,
   and increased telepresence. In addition, congruent with the theory of
   cognitive fit, the effects of VR are more pronounced when it exhibits
   products whose salient attributes are completely apparent through visual
   and auditory cues (because most VR on desktop computers uses only those
   two sensory modalities to deliver information). Based on these
   attributes, we distinguish between two types of products-namely,
   virtually high experiential (VHE) and virtually low experiential (VLE)
   products-in terms of the sensory modalities that are used and required
   for product inspection. Hypotheses arising from the distinctions

Abstract = {{Managing premenstrual symptoms at the most fundamental level
   necessitates careful consideration of female reproductive biology.
   Inhibiting ovulation using hormonal agents is a reasonable approach for
   reducing premenstrual symptoms, but the benefits of agents such as
   gonaclotropin-releasing hormone agonists and the synthetic androgen
   danazol are largely offset by their adverse effects and costs.
   Combination oral contraceptives provide an alternative that is widely
   accepted by women experiencing premenstrual symptoms and by their
   physicians; and newer formulations with lower levels of estrogen and
   progestin, administered using a monthly regimen with a shortened
   pill-free interval, appear promising for alleviating patient distress
   from severe premenstrual symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Chronic lead (Pb) exposure during development is known to
   produce learning deficits. Nitric oxide participates in the synaptic
   mechanisms involved in certain forms of learning and memory. This study
   was designed to clarify whether Pb-induced impairment in learning and
   memory was associated with the changes of nitric oxide levels in mice
   brains. Methods Sixty Balb/c mice aged 10 days were chosen. A model of
   lead exposure was established by drinking 0.025\%, 0.05\%, 0.075\% lead
   acetate, respectively for 8 weeks. The controls were orally given
   distilled water. The ability to learn and memorize was examined by open
   field test, T-water maze test. In parallel with the behavioral data, NO
   level of hippocampus tissue was detected by biochemical assay. Results
   Compared with control groups, (1) the weight of 0.075\% group was
   significantly reduced (P < 0.05); (2) The number of times in mice
   attaining the required standards in T-water maze test was lower in
   0.075\% group (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found between
   experimental and control groups in open field test (P > 0.05); (3) NO
   level of mouse hippocampus tissue was decreased in 0.075\% group (P <
   0.01). Conclusions The findings suggest that decreased hippocampus NO
   level may contribute to the Pb-induced deficits in learning and memory

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and
   matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in gastric carcinomas, and to correlate
   this expression with clinicopathological parameters and angiogenesis.
   Methods: Ninety-six resected tumor specimens from patients with gastric
   carcinoma were obtained, and 30 corresponding paracancerous normal
   tissues were randomly selected as a control. Immunohistochemical
   staining was used for detecting the expression of COX-2 and MMP-9.
   Monoclonal antibody against CD34 was used for displaying vascular
   endothelial cells, and microvascular density (MVD) was calculated by
   counting of CD34-positive vascular endothelial cells.
   Results: The positive expression rates of COX-2, MMP-9 and MVD in the
   cancerous tissue were 80.2\%, 74.0\%, and 32.5 +/- 8.3, respectively,
   which were significantly higher than those in the normal tissue (P <
   0.01). COX-2, MMP-9 expression rates and MVD in the patients with stages
   III and IV were 91.4\%, 84.5\% and 34.9 +/- 8.7, respectively, which
   were significantly higher than those in the patients with stages I and
   II (P < 0.01). In addition, the Spearman rank correlation test showed
   that tumor MVD was closely associated with COX-2 (r=0.311, P < 0.01) and
   MMP-9 (r=0.349, P < 0.01) expressions.
   Conclusions: Overexpression of COX-2 and MMP-9 is related to tumor
   invasion and lymph node metastasis in the gastric carcinoma. These
   results provide evidence that COX-2 contribute to gastric cancer
   development by promoting MMP-9 expression and angiogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Striatal degeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) is associated with
   increases in perikaryal calbindin immunolabeling in yet-surviving
   striatal projection neurons. Since similar increases have also been
   observed in surviving striatal projection neurons after intrastriatal
   injection of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid, the increased calbindin in
   HD striatum has been interpreted to suggest an excitotoxic process in
   HD. We used immunolabeling to assess if calbindin is elevated in
   striatal projection neurons of R6/2 HD transgenic mice. These mice bear
   exon 1 of the human huntingtin gene with 144 CAG repeats and show some
   of the neuropathological signs (e.g., neuronal intranuclear inclusions)
   and clinical traits (e.g., wasting prior to early death) of HD. We found
   an increased frequency of calbindin-immunoreactive neuronal perikarya in
   the striatum of 6- and 12-week-old R6/2 mice compared to wild-type
   controls. This increase was most notable in the normally calbindin-poor
   dorsolateral striatum. We found no significant changes in the total area
   of striatum occupied by the calbindin-negative striosomes and no
   consistent changes in striatal calbindin mRNA. The increase in calbindin
   in R6/2 striatal neurons was thus limited to the matrix compartment, and
   it may be triggered by increased Ca2+ entry due to the demonstrated
   heightened NMDA sensitivity of these neurons. The data further support
   the similarity of R6/2 mice to HD, and are consistent with the
   occurrence of an excitotoxic process in striatum in both. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to determine the feasibility of conducting
   a family level intervention study in a clinical setting: (a) by
   evaluating nurses' and families' attitude towards the intervention and
   (b) assess the impact of the intervention on parents' wellbeing, coping
   behaviour, hardiness and adaptation. The research is
   descriptive-longitudinal and took place at the Children's Hospital of
   the Landspitali University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland. Eight nurses
   working at the Children's Hospital and 10 families of children and
   adolescents newly diagnosed with cancer participated in the study.
   Eligible families, nurse administrator and clinical nurses were invited
   to participate. The nurses and the families who agreed to participate
   were asked to answer questionnaires. The main research variables were
   willingness to participate in the study, number of families accepting
   the intervention, demographical information, number of nurses believing
   in the intervention and the effectiveness of the intervention. Majority
   of the families (83\%) were willing to participate in this study and all
   the nurses (n = 8) indicated positive responses regarding the
   implementation of the intervention within a clinical setting. Both
   mothers and fathers scored significantly higher on wellbeing after the
   intervention than before, but no significant difference was found in
   coping, hardiness or adaptation. Offering an educational and support
   intervention in a clinical setting for families of children and
   adolescents newly diagnosed with cancer can be feasible. Researchers and
   clinicians may want to enhance the intervention, test it on a bigger
   sample and with a control group.}},

   providing compatible pollen with the nutrients and signals required to
   proceed in pollination, and in many species, recognizing and inhibiting
   foreign pollen adhesion, hydration, germination and invasion. Much of
   the stigma machinery involved in these processes remains unknown. It is
   likely that the expression of a stigma-specific gene program confers
   specialized structural and functional properties. Here we used
   microarray technology and cDNA subtraction to build a profile of
   candidate stigma genes that facilitate early pollination events. Of over
   24,000 Arabidopsis genes probed, we identified 11,403 genes expressed in
   stigma tissue; 317 of these were not expressed in control tissues.
   Analysis of the stigma transcriptome demonstrated a unique
   transcriptional profile. Functional specialization of the stigma for
   extracellular interactions is reflected by an increased number of
   stigma-specific and stigma-expressed genes involved in sculpturing the
   cuticle and cell wall, lipid metabolism, as well as genes potentially
   involved in pollen-stigma interactions.}},

Abstract = {{SenC, a Sco1 homolog found in the purple photosynthetic bacteria, has
   been implicated in affecting photosynthesis and respiratory gene
   expression, as well as assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. In this study,
   we show that SenC from Rhodobacter capsulatus is involved in the
   assembly of a fully functional cbb(3)-type cytochrome c oxidase, as
   revealed by decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity in a senC mutant. We
   also show that a putative copper-binding site in SenC is required for
   activity and that a SenC deletion phenotype can be rescued by the
   addition of exogenous copper to the growth medium. In addition, we
   demonstrate that a SenC mutation has an indirect effect on gene
   expression caused by a reduction in cytochrome c oxidase activity. A
   model is proposed whereby a reduction in cytochrome c oxidase activity
   impedes the flow of electrons through the respiratory pathway, thereby
   affecting the oxidation/reduction state of the ubiquinone pool, leading
   to alterations of photosystem and respiratory gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{Iatrogenic injury to the spinal accessory nerve has been widely
   documented and can have medico-legal implications. The resulting
   syndrome of pain, paralysis and winging of the scapula are often the
   source of considerable morbidity. This paper researches the degree of
   accuracy achievable in mapping the surface anatomy of the spinal
   accessory nerve in the region of the posterior triangle with a view to
   creating a cartographical aid to surgical procedures. The necks of 25
   adult cadavers were dissected bilaterally to expose the spinal accessory
   nerve. Variations in the course and distribution of the spinal accessory
   nerve in the posterior triangle were recorded along with its
   relationship to the borders of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius.
   Considerable variation was seen in the surface and regional anatomy of
   the nerve and in the contribution of the cervical plexus to the spinal
   accessory nerve in the posterior triangle. Measurements of the running
   course and exit point of the nerve into and from the posterior triangle
   differed significantly from those previously recorded. Delineation of an
   accurate surface anatomy was not possible. Creating a map to define the
   surface anatomy of the spinal accessory nerve in the posterior triangle
   is an unrealistic goal given its wide variations in man. Avoidance of
   damage to the spinal accessory nerve cannot be achieved by slavishly
   adhering to surface markings given in textbooks, but only by cautious
   dissection during operations on the posterior triangle.}},

Journal = {{PLANT PHYSIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{139}},

Abstract = {{Using protein sequence data obtained from a calcium- and
   phospholipid-regulated protein kinase purified from maize (Zea mays), we
   isolated a cDNA encoding a calcium- dependent protein kinase (CDPK),
   which we designated ZmCPK11. The deduced amino acid sequence of ZmCPK11
   includes the sequences of all the peptides obtained from the native
   protein. The ZmCPK11 sequence contains the kinase, autoregulatory, and
   calmodulin-like domains typical of CDPKs. Transcripts for ZmCPK11 were
   present in every tested organ of the plant, relatively high in seeds and
   seedlings and lower in stems, roots, and leaves. In leaves, kinase
   activity and ZmCPK11 mRNA accumulation were stimulated by wounding. The
   level of ZmCPK11 is also increased in noninjured neighboring leaves. The
   results suggest that the maize protein kinase is involved in a systemic
   response to wounding. Bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase
   (GST)-ZmCPK11 was catalytically active in a calcium- dependent manner.
   Like the native enzyme, GST-ZmCPK11 was able to phosphorylate histone
   III-S and Syntide 2. Phosphorylation of histone was stimulated by
   phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid, whereas
   phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine,
   diolein, and cardiolipin did not increase the enzymatic activity.
   Autophosphorylation of GST-ZmCPK11 was stimulated by calcium and by
   phosphatidic acid and, to a lesser extent, by phosphatidylserine.
   Phosphatidylcholine did not affect autophosphorylation. These data
   unequivocally identify the maize phospholipid- and calcium- regulated
   protein kinase, which has protein kinase C-like activity, as a CDPK, and
   emphasize the potential that other CDPKs are regulated by phospholipids
   in addition to calcium.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Anesthesia inhibits normal thermoregulatory control, leading to
   perioperative hypothermia or allowing therapeutic hypothermia. During
   the last decade many studies have shown the effects of anesthesia on
   thermoregulation. As a consequence many active warming and cooling
   devices are available to manipulate patients' core temperature. This
   review focuses on new findings in the field of temperature management.
   Recent findings
   Thermal management of patients has improved tremendously in recent
   years. Many outcome studies have shown adverse effects of perioperative
   hypothermia, as well as beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia
   after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and brain trauma. However, inducing
   hypothermia is limited by physiologic thermoregulatory responses. Small
   reductions in core temperature lead to vasoconstriction and shivering,
   effectively hindering hypothermia. Thus prevention of vasoconstriction
   and shivering have become major goals during induction of therapeutic
   hypothermia. All anesthetics, opioids and sedatives lower the
   vasoconstriction and shivering threshold, thus allowing hypothermia.
   However, these drugs have side effects, such as respiratory depression,
   sedation and nausea. Several drugs, alone or in combination, lower the
   shivering threshold while causing minimal or no side effects.
   Summary
   Anesthesia affects thermoregulatory control and leads to perioperative
   hypothermia. The prevention of perioperative hypothermia improves
   patient's outcome. Therapeutic hypothermia can be induced and also
   improves outcome in certain conditions.}},

   and that the mixed enzyme was most effective. Feed intake remained the
   same for all of the treatment groups. Carcass weight was increased by
   mixed enzyme significantly, but not by cellulase and hemicellulase. The
   enzymes, but not mixed enzyme, decreased abdominal fat and were
   significant in the case of cellulase. Enzymes did not affect muscle
   weight and nitrogen-retention, but metabolizable energy content of the

Title = {{Understanding primary care physicians' propensity to assess elderly

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to examine primary care
   physicians' propensity to assess their elderly patients for depression
   using data from videotapes and patient and physician surveys.
   Study Design: An observational study was informed by surveys of 389
   patients and 33 physicians, and 389 videotapes of their clinical
   interactions. Secondary quantitative analyses used video data scored by
   the Assessment of Doctor-Elderly Patient Transactions system regarding
   depression assessment. A random-effects logit model was used to analyze
   the effects of patient health, competing demands, and racial and gender
   concordance on physicians' propensity to assess elderly patients for
   depression.
   Results: Physicians assessed depression in only 14\% of the visits. The
   use of formal depression assessment tools occurred only 3 times. White
   patients were almost 7 times more likely than nonwhite patients to be
   assessed for depression (odds ratio {[}OR], 6.9; P < 0.01). Depression
   assessment was less likely if the patient functioned better emotionally
   (OR, 0.95; P < 0.01). The propensity of depression assessment was higher
   in visits that covered multiple topics (OR, 1.3; P < 0.01) contrary to
   the notion of competing demands crowding out mental health services.
   Unexpectedly, depression assessment was less likely to occur in gender
   and racially concordant patient-physician dyads.
   Conclusions: Primary care physicians assessed their elderly patients for
   depression infrequently. Reducing the number of topics covered in visits
   and matching patients and physicians based on race and gender may be
   counterproductive to depression detection. Informed by videotapes and
   surveys, our findings offer new insights on the actual care process and
   present conclusions that are different from studies based on
   administrative or survey data alone.}},

Abstract = {{Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH-array) has a powerful
   potential for high-throughput identification of genetic aberrations in
   cell genomes. We identified a homozygous loss of ADAM23 (2q33.3) in the
   course of a program to screen a panel of gastric cancer ( GC) cell lines
   (1/32, 3.1\%) for genomic copy-number aberrations using our custom-made
   CGH-array. Infrequent homozygous deletion of ADAM23 was also seen in
   primary gastric tumors (1/39, 2.6\%). ADAM23 mRNA was expressed in
   normal stomach tissue, but not in the majority of GC cell lines without
   homozygous deletion of this gene. Expression of ADAM23 mRNA was restored
   to gene-silenced GC cells after treatment with 5-aza 2'-deoxycytidine.
   The methylation status of the ADAM23 CpG island, which showed promoter
   activity, correlated inversely with its expression. Methylation of this
   CpG island was observed both in GC cell lines and in primary GC tissues;
   in primary tumors with a hypermethylated CpG island, expression of
   ADAM23 was lower than in adjacent noncancerous tissues. Moreover,
   restoration of ADAM23 in GC cells reduced their numbers in
   colony-formation assays. These results suggest that genetic or
   epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation of the ADAM23 CpG-rich promoter
   region leads to loss of ADAM23 function, which may be a factor in
   gastric carcinogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Uniparental disomy (UPD) is the inheritance of a chromosome pair from
   one parent and is increasingly recognized as a cause of abnormal
   phenotypes either due to imprinted genes or, in the case of isodisomy,
   to homozygosity of recessive alleles. Maternal uniparental disomy for
   chromosome 14 (matUPD{[}14]) may cause a characteristic phenotype
   including precocious puberty. Central precocious puberty (CPP) was
   diagnosed in a 6-year-old girl with some dysmorphic features, truncal
   obesity, small hands, and small feet. Cytogenetic analysis of her
   peripheral blood demonstrated chromosomal
   rearrangement:Robertsonian-translocation 45, XX, der(13;14)(q10;q10).
   MatUPD(14) was demonstrated in the patient by haplotype analysis of
   chromosome 14, showing that the CPP is one of the features caused by
   matUPD(14). The CPP was Successfully treated with higher dosage of
   long-acting gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue, Leuprolide
   (R), 90 mu g/kg/month. This is the first report that describes GnRH
   analogue treatment for CPP associated with matUPD(14), suggesting that
   the GnRH analogue treatment is appropriate even for such a specific type
   of CPP.}},

Abstract = {{In November 2004 a Chinese nuclear submarine cruised into Japan's
   territorial waters near the Okinawa Islands. In response, the Japanese
   government dispatched several Japanese naval ships and planes to chase
   the Chinese submarine until it navigated into international waters. This
   event, which potentially could have become the first exchange of fire
   between Japan and China since the Second World War, illuminated
   increasingly problematic security relations between the two neighbouring
   countries in the twenty-first century. In fact, deterioration of
   Sino-Japanese security relations is not a recent phenomenon but has
   already been evident since the mid-1990s, when Japan imposed a series of
   economic sanctions on China. Between 1995 and 2000 Japan had suspended
   its foreign aid to China in protest against: China's nuclear weapons
   tests; China's large scale war game including the launch of missiles
   across the Taiwan Strait; and Chinese naval activities in disputed areas
   in the East China Sea. This article looks at Sino-Japanese security
   relations since the mid-1990s through three case studies of the aid
   sanctions imposed by Japan on China. It clarifies the domestic political
   and bureaucratic interests that motivated aid sanctions and determined
   the decision-making process leading to these sanctions. The article
   argues, that with certain politico-security interests, Japanese
   governments actively used foreign aid as a strategic instrument to
   counter provocative military actions by China in the East Asian region
   since the mid-1990s. Despite the limited influence that Japanese aid
   sanctions have actually had on Chinese military behaviour, Japan's
   strategic use of foreign aid has undeniably created a new dynamism in
   security relations between the two neighbouring great powers in Asia.}},

Abstract = {{The methodology recently developed by the Nuclear Metrology Laboratory
   (LMN) from IPEN, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, for simulating all detection
   processes in a 4 pi(beta X)gamma coincidence system by means of the
   Monte Carlo technique is described. This procedure makes possible to
   predict the behavior of the observed activity as a function of the 4 pi
   beta detector efficiency. The present paper describes its application to
   the standardization of a typical beta-gamma radionuclide, namely Cs-134.
   In this approach, information contained in the decay scheme is used for
   determining the contribution of all radiations emitted by the selected
   radionuclide to the measured spectra of each detector. This simulation
   yields the shape of the coincidence spectrum, allowing the choice of
   suitable gamma-ray energies for which the activity can be obtained with
   maximum accuracy. The theoretical work applies the MCNP Monte Carlo code
   to a gas-flow proportional counter with 4 pi detection geometry, coupled
   to a pair of NaI(Tl) crystals. The calculated extrapolation curve showed
   good agreement when compared to experimental values obtained at the LMN
   of IPEN.}},

Abstract = {{The arachidonic acid-producing fungus Mortierella alpina 1S-4, an
   industrial strain, was endowed with Zeocin resistance by integration of
   the Zeocin-resistance gene at the rDNA locus of genomic DNA. Plasmid DNA
   was introduced into spores by microprojectile bombardment. Twenty mg/ml
   Zeocin completely inhibited the germination of M. alpina 1S-4 spores,
   and decreased the growth rate of fungal filaments to some extent. It was
   suggested that preincubation period and temperature had a great
   influence on transformation efficiency. Four out of 26 isolated
   transformants were selected. Molecular analysis of these stable
   transformants showed that the plasmid DNA was integrated into the rDNA
   locus of the genomic DNA. We expect that this system will be applied for
   useful oil production by gene manipulation of M. alpina 1S-4 and its
   derivative mutants. On the basis of the fundamental transformation
   system, we also tried to overexpress a homologous polyunsaturated fatty
   acid elongase gene, which has been reported to be included in the
   rate-limiting step for arachidonic acid production, thereby leading to
   increased arachidonic acid production.}},

Abstract = {{Suppression of resistance in a dense Pseudomonas aeruginosa population
   has previously been shown with optimized quinolone exposures. However,
   the relevance to beta-lactams is unknown. We investigated the
   bactericidal activity of meropenem and its propensity to suppress P.
   aeruginosa resistance in an in vitro hollow-fiber infection model
   (HFIM). Two isogenic strains of P. aeruginosa (wild type and an AmpC
   stably derepressed mutant {[}MIC = 1 mg/liter]) were used. An HFIM
   inoculated with approximately 1 X 10(8) CFU/ml of bacteria was subjected
   to various meropenem exposures. Maintenance doses were given every 8 h
   to simulate the maximum concentration achieved after a 1-g dose in all
   regimens, but escalating unbound minimum concentrations (C(min)s) were
   simulated with different clearances. Serial samples were obtained over 5
   days to quantify the meropenem concentrations, the total bacterial
   population, and subpopulations with reduced susceptibilities to
   meropenem (> 3 x the MIC). For both strains, a significant bacterial
   burden reduction was seen with all regimens at 24 h. Regrowth was
   apparent after 3 days, with the C-min/MIC ratio being <= 1.7 (time above
   the MIC, 100\%). Selective amplification of subpopulations with reduced
   susceptibilities to meropenem was suppressed with a C-min/MIC of >= 6.2
   or by adding tobramycin to meropenem (C-min/MIC = 1.7). Investigations
   that were longer than 24 h and that used high inocula may be necessary
   to fully evaluate the relationship between drug exposures and the
   likelihood of resistance suppression. These results suggest that the
   Cmi./MIC of meropenem can be optimized to suppress the emergence of
   non-plasmid-mediated P. aeruginosa resistance. Our in vitro data support
   the use of an extended duration of meropenem infusion for the treatment
   of severe nosocomial infections in combination with an aminoglycoside.}},

Abstract = {{Despite contemporary Confucianism's aspirations to be a world
   philosophy, there is an ethnocentric strand within the Confucian
   tradition, most glaringly exemplified in Han Yu's attacks on Buddhism.
   This paper re-assesses Confucian ethnocentrism in the context of
   contrary practices that indicate a more pragmatic attitude among
   Confucians toward cross-cultural interactions. It argues that while the
   ethnocentric tendency serves as constant reminder of the need for
   vigilance, and recognition of the difficulties of crossing cultural
   boundaries, there are nevertheless resources within Confucianism for
   constructing an ethics of communication that is urgently needed to deal
   with the moral problems of cultural pluralism. The paper analyses the
   role of various common Confucian virtues such as ren (benevolence,
   co-humanity), yi (appropriateness), li (ritual), zhi (wisdom) in
   communication, and argues that a virtue of flexibility is implicit in
   Confucius's insistence of bugu and could contribute significantly to a
   Confucian ethics of communicative virtues.}},

Abstract = {{Current agricultural systems are the result of decoupling crop/livestock
   enterprises for short-term economic gain at the expense of long-term
   sustainability. Objectives of our research were to determine the
   influences of winter grazing dry gestating beef cows on no-till forage
   and grain production, water-use efficiency, and protein and phosphorus
   (P) production for an oat/pea-triticale/sweet clover-corn 3-year
   cropping system. Oat/pea and triticale crops were harvested for grain,
   with the straw and chaff left in swaths after harvest for winter
   grazing. Drilled corn for forage was swathed in late September. Cropping
   system treatments were: (1) straw and corn chopped and left in place
   (IP); (2) straw and corn baled and removed without livestock (R); and
   (3) straw and corn swath grazed by livestock (L). The first winter for
   grazing dry, bred cows was in 1999-2000; therefore, no treatment
   differences occurred for the 1999 crop. In 2000, oat/pea and triticale
   grain and straw production for the IP treatment was about half of the
   production for the R treatment, because of low oat/pea and triticale
   plant stands on the IP treatment. Averaged over all years, corn was
   about 1.5 times more efficient in using water for dry matter production
   when compared to oat/pea or triticale. Generally, protein and P
   production, on a unit area basis, were highest for corn and lowest for
   triticale. Averaged over 4 years, about half of the nitrogen used for
   protein production was derived from sources other than applied
   commercial fertilizer. Data suggest that more than 4 years of research
   are needed to understand cropping system and animal interactions on
   forage and grain production in integrated crop/livestock systems, with
   trends in year four suggesting that livestock may enhance forage and
   grain production.}},

Abstract = {{Removal of the intraforaminal portion of a jugular foramen schwannoma
   under direct vision requires resection of the adjacent bone. Extensive
   resection of the bone around the jugular foramen, however, involves a
   potential danger for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and for damage to
   the adjacent cranial nerves as well as venous outflow. To avoid such
   bone resection, we applied the endoscope during the removal of a jugular
   foramen schwannoma through the lateral suboccipital approach. Three
   patients with schwannomas in the jugular foramen were treated using the
   lateral suboccipital approach with endoscopic assistance. After the
   intracranial portion was first removed under the microscope, the
   residual tumor in the jugular foramen was subsequently removed under the
   side-viewing endoscope. In all cases the tumor was removed successfully
   without major complications. The authors conclude that if the cases are
   selected properly, removal of the schwannoma extending into the jugular
   foramen is feasible through the conventional lateral suboccipital window
   under endoscopic assistance.}},

Abstract = {{The increased utilization of European 32-min cabinet construction in the
   Turkish furniture industry has highlighted the need for practical
   strength performance evaluation of case construction. A basic
   understanding of the influence of dowel spacing on corner joint strength
   performance in case construction is necessary to assist furniture
   manufacturers as they engineer their products. To date, limited research
   had been done. This paper presents results of evaluating the effect of
   dowel spacing on bending moment capacity of corner joints in 32-mm case
   construction. Laminated particleboard and laminated medium density
   fiberboard (MDF) corner joints were tested under compression and tension
   loads. Experiments have shown that maximum moment is obtained in joints
   when the spacing between dowels is at least 96 mm. Also, statistical
   analysis of the test data indicated that joints loaded in tension and
   compression had significant differences at the 5 percent significance
   level in moment resistance since joint strength was strongly related to
   the internal bond strength of the board loaded in compression. In both
   tension and compression tests, MDF corner joints were stronger than
   particleboard corner joints.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic differential electric servo cylinders are strongly nonlinear,
   coupled multivariable electromechanical tools applicable for driving,
   e.g., manipulators. Since they have considerable advantages in
   comparison with electric drives, it would be desirable to extend their
   application to dynamic continuous path (CP) control, too. From this
   point of view these systems have the following specialties: a) the most
   important phenomena influencing their behavior as, e.g., warming up of
   the sliding surfaces, are determined by local effects, and cannot be
   controlled globally; b) the friction forces show discontinuous variation
   at the zero transition of the piston's velocity that is a locally
   nonlinearizable nonlinearity. A common proportional, integral, and
   derivative (PID) controller may generate a noise-like acceleration
   signal due to feeding back the effects of such fluctuations. Warming up
   of the working fluid during operation influences these friction
   properties, too. Dynamic interaction between the system and its
   environment neither measured nor modeled by the controller is another
   agent influencing the system's observable behavior. For this purpose a
   special controller was elaborated. It implements certain adaptivity to
   compensate the effects of the inaccurate model and the unknown external
   disturbances, and also contains a nonconventional noise filtering
   technique to reduce the effect of the fluctuating friction forces. In
   the paper the control method is described, and then its capabilities are
   illustrated via simulation results.}},

   X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic investigations have been carried out
   in order to gain different perspectives on how the solid solution adapts
   at different length scales to cation mixing. X-ray powder diffraction
   and powder absorption IR spectroscopy data are presented. The powder
   diffraction data show that there is no significant excess volume of
   mixing on the Fe-Mn columbite join. All the unit-cell parameters
   decrease linearly as a function of increasing Fe content. Substitution
   of Fe2+ for the larger Mn2+ cation causes a decrease in the volume of
   the A polyhedron, which also becomes more regular with respect to both
   bond-length and edge-length distortion parameters. No significant
   variation of the B site has been observed. Wavenumber shifts of the IR
   peaks nearly all vary linearly with composition, consistent with linear
   variations of the lattice parameters. Line broadening has been
   quantified by autocorrelation analysis of the IR spectra. This is
   interpreted as suggesting that there is some element of local strain or
   positional disorder at the length scale of second or third nearest
   neighbours around sites occupied by Fe.}},

   Radioactive Ion Beams (RIBs) using the Isotope Separator On-Line (ISOL)
   technique. HRIBF also maintains a vibrant development program for ISOL
   targets, ion sources and diagnostics. As a bridge to RIA, HRIBF
   continues to expand its technology. Presently, a \$4.75M High Power
   Target Laboratory (HPTL) is being constructed to provide a facility for
   testing new targets, target geometries, ion sources and beam preparation
   techniques. HPTL will ultimately be co-located with a second RIB
   production system (IRIS2). An external axial injection system for the
   driver cyclotron, ORIC, is planned to provide higher beam intensities,
   reduce machine activation and eliminate cathode lifetime limitations. A
   multi-channel residual gas BPM is under development for measuring
   intensity and position of the driver beam. RIB production via
   electron-induced photofission is also being explored to attain higher

Abstract = {{Wetland restoration requires good science, good engineering, and
   political will. The process has evolved in fits and starts over the past
   30+ years as scholars have enumerated the functions lost as a result of
   wetland destruction. Measuring effects of wetland restoration,

   on restoration goals. The goals should express a balance among
   ecological, social, political, and economic functions, and recognize
   that the functions are multi-dimensional and intertwined. A thorough
   ecological assessment of wetland restoration and monitoring should have
   a parallel component focusing on societal values as well as ecological
   values.
   Four U.S. watershed examples-The Mississippi River watershed, the
   Delaware Bay watershed, the Lower Fox River, Wisconsin, and South Cape
   Beach Marsh on Cape Cod, Massachusetts-illustrate the importance of the

Abstract = {{Si-n clusters in the size range n = 4-30 have been investigated using a
   combination of global structure optimization methods with DFT and ab
   initio calculations. One of the central aims is to provide explanations
   for the structural transition from prolate to spherical outer shapes at
   about n = 25, as observed in ion mobility measurements. Firstly, several
   existing empirical potentials for silicon and a newly generated variant
   of one of them were better adapted to small silicon clusters, by global
   optimization of their parameters. The best resulting empirical
   potentials were then employed in global cluster structure optimizations.
   The most promising structures from this stage were relaxed further at
   the DFT level with the hybrid B3LYP functional. For the resulting
   structures, single point energies have been calculated at the LMP2 level
   with a reasonable medium-sized basis set, cc-pVTZ. These DFT and LMP2
   calculations were also carried out for the best structures proposed in
   the literature, including the most recent ones, to obtain the currently
   best and most complete overall picture of the structural preferences of
   silicon clusters. In agreement with recent findings, results obtained at
   the DFT level do support the shape transition from prolate to spherical
   structures, beginning with Si-26 (albeit not completely without
   problems). In stark contrast, at the LMP2 level, the dominance of
   spherical structures after the transition region could not be confirmed.
   Instead, just as below the transition region, prolate isomers are
   obtained as the lowest-energy structures for n <= 29. We conclude that
   higher (probably multireference) levels of theoretical treatments are
   needed before the puzzle of the silicon cluster shape transition at n =
   25 can safely be considered as explained.}},

Abstract = {{Objective - Inhibition of 2,3-oxidosqualene: lanosterol cyclase (OSC),
   an enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, has the unique ability
   to inhibit cholesterol synthesis while simultaneously enhancing
   oxysterol synthesis. Our objectives were to determine, in vivo, if a
   novel OSC inhibitor reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
   and to define the mechanism(s) involved.
   Methods and Results - Miniature pigs received the OSC inhibitor
   RO0717625 or placebo and a diet containing fat (34\% of energy) and 400
   mg per day of cholesterol. Treatment decreased plasma total cholesterol
   (-20\%)and LDL cholesterol (-29\%). Apolipoprotein B (apoB) kinetic
   parameters were determined. Very low - density lipoprotein (VLDL) apoB
   pool size decreased 22\% because of inhibition of VLDL production
   (-43\%). LDL apoB pool size decreased 22\% because of a 1.5-fold
   increase in fractional catabolic rate (FCR). The increased FCR was
   associated with a 2-fold increase in hepatic LDL receptor mRNA. Hepatic
   total and microsomal cholesterol were reduced by 16\% and 27\%,
   respectively. Plasma lathosterol concentrations decreased 57\%,
   reflecting inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Treatment
   reduced plasma plant sterols and decreased postprandial cholesterol
   transport in chylomicrons.
   Conclusions - A novel OSC inhibitor, RO0717625, decreased VLDL and LDL
   apoB100 through decreased VLDL production and enhanced LDL clearance.
   Thus, OSC represents a potential therapeutic target for dyslipidemia.}},

Abstract = {{Intradural spinal arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), a subtype of spinal
   arteriovenous malformation in which there is a direct communication
   between a spinal artery and a vein on the cord surface or in the
   subarachnoid space, are generally considered to be congenital lesions
   caused by maldevelopment of the embryonic vascular system. The authors
   present the cases of two patients with acquired AVFs of the terminal
   filum. In each patient an AVF between the distal segment of the anterior
   spinal artery and its accompanying vein on the terminal filum developed
   within I year of repeated lumbar myelography that had demonstrated no
   evidence of abnormal vascularity. In both patients spinal arteriography
   demonstrated the absence of medullary venous drainage in the
   thoracolumbar region, which, combined with the arterialized venous input
   from the AVF, permitted the development of venous congestion and
   myelopathy. The involved segment of the terminal filum was excised in
   vitro microarteriography and the histopathological examination
   demonstrated a single, simple arteriovenous connection in both patients.
   The findings in these cases indicate that intradural AVF can
   spontaneously arise in later life. The development of these lesions
   and/or their clinical manifestation may require not only the presence of
   the AVF, but also deficiency of medullary spinal venous drainage. The

   iron in its +2 and +3 oxidation states to be assigned to the M1 to M4
   sites of the Constituent minerals, tremolite-actinolite in the case of
   nephrite jades. EPR at two frequencies, 9.4 GHz (X-band) and 94.1 GHz
   (W-band), allowed the determination of the distribution of Mn2+ in these
   sites. The results are apparently contrary to the usual assignments made
   for the parent minerals tremolite and actinolite. In two cases, one a
   nephrite jade and the other a serpentine, significant quantities of
   magnetically ordered minerals chalcopyrite and magnetite were identified
   by Mossbauer spectroscopy. These minerals Could not be found in the
   X-ray diffraction patterns of the same minerals leading to the
   conclusion that they are very finely divided in the samples Studied.}},

Abstract = {{In this introduction to the Journal of Personality special issue devoted
   to ``Advances in Personality and Daily Experience{''} we attempt to
   trace recent progress in the study of personality and daily life. We
   begin by comparing and contrasting the methods of daily experience
   research adopted by investigators who authored empirical articles in the
   1991 and current special issues according to the mode, schedule, and
   sampling frame for data collection. We then compare data analytic
   strategies across the 14 years between the two special issues and
   conclude that although the nature of the questions addressed has not
   changed dramatically, newer analytic methods and associated software
   have enhanced our ability to answer these questions more precisely.
   Finally, we provide an overview of the special issue contributions
   organized around three broad themes: personal vulnerabilities and
   resources that predict reactions to everyday events, interpersonal
   manifestations of personality in daily experience, and how personality
   in daily life affects physical and mental health and relates to disease
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{Cryopreservation of human hepatocytes is important for the treatment of
   liver disease by hepatocyte transplantation and also for the use of
   hepatocytes as an in vitro model of the liver. One factor in the success
   of cryopreservation is the quality of cells before freezing.
   Preincubation of hepatocytes with cytoprotective compounds to allow
   recovery from the isolation process prior to cryopreservation, such as
   those that will boost cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content or
   antioxidants, may improve the viability and function of cells upon
   thawing. Rat hepatocytes were used to investigate the effects of
   preincubation with 10 compounds: precursors (glucose, fructose,
   glutathione, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine), antioxidants (ascorbic acid
   and a-lipoic acid), and compounds with multiple effects
   (N-acetylcysteine, pentoxifylline, prostaglandin E-1, and
   tauroursodeoxycholic acid). Human hepatocytes were then used to
   investigate 5 of the original 10 compounds (glucose, fructose,
   alpha-lipoic acid, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, and pentoxifylline). Glucose
   preincubation (100 - 300 mM) improved the viability and attachment
   efficiency of rat hepatocytes and improved the viability and reduced
   lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage of human hepatocytes. Fructose
   preincubation (100 300 mM) improved the viability and attachment
   efficiency of rat hepatocytes and improved the attachment efficiency of
   human hepatocytes. alpha-lipoic acid preincubation (0.5 - 5 mM) improved
   the viability and attachment efficiency of both rat and human
   hepatocytes. At a concentration of 2.5 mM alpha-lipoic acid also
   improved the albumin production of human hepatocytes. In conclusion,
   preincubation of hepatocytes prior to cryopreservation can improve the
   viability and function of thawed cells and may provide a method of
   obtaining better-quality cryopreserved hepatocytes for transplantation.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. The purpose of this study was to document findings of ankle
   arthroscopy in patients with residual complaints after an appropriately
   treated ankle fracture. Methods: Patients who had ankle arthroscopy at
   the Alpine Orthosports Clinic between 1998 and 2000 were identified by a
   retrospective review of the ankle arthroscopy database. Fifty patients
   were identified who had arthroscopy for complaints after ankle fracture.
   The mean duration from injury to arthroscopy was 20.5 +/- 33.5 months,
   with a range of 2 to 184.6 months. Results: There were 37 isolated
   fractures and 13 combination fractures. The Danis-Weber classification
   was used for lateral malleolar fractures. There were five type A, 14
   type B, and 11 type C lateral malleolar fractures. Results: Synovitis
   was present in 46 ankles and was located anterolaterally in 36.
   Synovitis was noted in 26 of the 30 ankles that had a lateral malleolar
   fracture. Arthrofibrosis was found in 20 ankles, with anterolateral
   joint involvement in 16. There was chondral damage noted in 45 ankles,
   30 located on the talus and 15 on the tibia. Spurs were found in 15
   ankles, and nine had loose bodies or debris. There were two
   postoperative complications: one patient had bleeding from a portal and
   the other had an area of paresthesia at the anterolateral portal site.
   Conclusion: Synovitis and chondral damage were more frequent than
   arthrofibrosis and spurs. Synovitis and arthrofibrosis were found most
   frequently in the anterolateral aspect of the joint. Also, the higher
   the lateral malleolar fracture was in relation to the syndesmosis, the
   higher was the occurrence of talar chondral damage.}},

Journal = {{HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},

Abstract = {{Context. A1c levels are widely used to assess quality of diabetes care
   provided by health care systems. Currently, cross-sectional measures are
   commonly used for such assessments.
   Objective. To study within-patient longitudinal changes in A1c levels at
   Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities as an alternative to
   cross-sectional measures of quality of diabetes care.
   Design. Longitudinal study using institutional data on individual
   patient A1c level over time (October 1, 1998-September 30, 2000) with
   time variant and invariant covariates.
   Setting. One hundred and twenty-five VHA facilities nationwide, October
   1, 1998-September 30, 2000.
   Patients. Diabetic veteran users with A1c measurement performed using
   National Glycosylated Hemoglobin Standardization Project certified A1c
   lab assay methods.
   Exposures. Characteristics unlikely to reflect quality of care, but
   known to influence A1c levels, demographics, and baseline illness
   severity.
   Main Outcome Measure. Monthly change in A1c for average patient cared
   for at each facility.
   Results. The preponderance of facilities showed monthly declines in
   within-patient A1c over the study period (mean change of -0.0148 A1c
   units per month, range -0.074 to 0.042). Individual facilities varied in
   their monthly change, with 105 facilities showing monthly declines (70
   significant at .05 level) and 20 showing monthly increases (5
   significant at .05 level). Case-mix adjustment resulted in modest
   changes (mean change of -0.0131 case-mix adjusted A1c units per month,
   range -0.079 to 0.043). Facilities were ranked from worst to best, with
   attached 90 percent confidence intervals. Among the bottom 10 ranked
   facilities, four remained within the bottom decile with 90 percent
   confidence.
   Conclusions. There is substantial variation in facility-level
   longitudinal changes in A1c levels. We propose that evaluation of change
   in A1c levels over time can be used as a new measure to reflect quality
   of care provided to populations of individuals with chronic disease.}},

Title = {{Kinetic analysis of dynamic F-18-fluoromisonidazole PET correlates with
   radiation treatment outcome in head-and-neck cancer}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hypoxia compromises local control in patients with
   head-and-neck cancer (HNC). In order to determine the value of
   {[}F-18]-fluoromisonidazole (Fmiso) with regard to tumor hypoxia, a
   patient study with dynamic Fmiso PET was performed. For a better
   understanding of tracer uptake and distribution, a kinetic model was
   developed to analyze dynamic Fmiso PET data.
   Methods: For 15 HNC patients, dynamic Fmiso PET examinations were
   performed prior to radiotherapy (RT) treatment. The data was analyzed
   using a two compartment model, which allows the determination of
   characteristic hypoxia and perfusion values. For different parameters,
   such as patient age, tumor size and standardized uptake value, the
   correlation to treatment outcome was tested using the
   Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U-test. Statistical tests were also performed for
   hypoxia and perfusion parameters determined by the kinetic model and for
   two different metrics based on these parameters.
   Results: The kinetic Fmiso analysis extracts local hypoxia and perfusion
   characteristics of a tumor tissue. These parameters are independent
   quantities. In this study, different types of characteristic
   hypoxia-perfusion patterns in tumors could be identified. The clinical
   verification of the results, obtained on the basis of the kinetic
   analysis, showed a high correlation of hypoxia-perfusion patterns and RT
   treatment outcome (p = 0.001) for this initial patient group.
   Conclusion: The presented study established, that Fmiso PET scans may
   benefit from dynamic acquisition and analysis by a kinetic model. The
   pattern of distribution of perfusion and hypoxia in the tissue is
   correlated to local control in HNC.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study of cellulose crystallinity based on the sample
   crystallinity and the cellulose content in plant fibres was performed
   for samples of different origin. Strong acid hydrolysis was found
   superior to agricultural fibre analysis and comprehensive plant fibre
   analysis for a consistent determination of the cellulose content.
   Crystallinity determinations were based on X-ray powder diffraction
   methods using side-loaded samples in reflection (Bragg-Brentano) mode.
   Rietveld refinements based on the recently published crystal structure
   of cellulose I beta followed by integration of the crystalline and
   amorphous (background) parts were performed. This was shown to be
   straightforward to use and in many ways advantageous to traditional
   crystallinity determinations using the Segal or the Ruland-Vonk methods.
   The determined cellulose crystallinities were 90 - 100 g/ 100 g
   cellulose in plant-based fibres and 60 - 70 g/ 100 g cellulose in wood
   based fibres. These findings are significant in relation to strong fibre
   composites and bio-ethanol production.}},

Abstract = {{The progress of modernization is accompanied by an emphasis on urban
   mobility and economic growth together with increasing environmental
   awareness. This article aims at analysing the transformation of
   transport systems (car-road system and public transport) together with
   related urban changes and their societal effects in three very different
   cities: Santiago, Tehran and Copenhagen. In these cities vehicle
   ownership is increasing and motorized mobility is further facilitated.
   Mass motorization is an essential part of modernization. However its
   impact on societal development is an area of research that has received
   little attention. Moreover, mass motorization is handled in different
   ways in different socio-political settings. In Tehran the emphasis is on
   technological upgrading and enlargement. In Santiago, an important
   re-regulation and modernisation of the systems is taking place. In
   Copenhagen all kinds of improvements are made partly inspired by the
   Agenda 21. Furthermore, as this article points out, the local political
   order and chosen strategies to handle motorization problems are diverse.
   My analysis emphasizes mass motorization, political interventions, civil
   society urban governance, sustainable development and the management of
   urban mobility. I conclude that political strength at the city level
   seems to be weaker than what is observed at the national level.}},

Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1305-1320}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes an adaptive neuro-fuzzy control system for
   controlling a flexible manipulator with variable payload. The controller
   proposed in this paper is comprised of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) in
   the feedback configuration and two dynamic recurrent neural networks in
   the forward path. A dynamic recurrent identification network (RIN) is
   used to identify the output of the manipulator system, and a dynamic
   recurrent learning network (RLN) is employed to learn the weighting
   factor of the fuzzy logic. It is envisaged that the integration of fuzzy
   logic and neural network based-controller will encompass the merits of
   both technologies, and thus provide a robust controller for the flexible
   manipulator system. The fuzzy logic controller, based on fuzzy set
   theory, provides a means for converting a linguistic control strategy
   into control action and offering a high level of computation. On the
   other hand, the ability of a dynamic recurrent network structure to
   model an arbitrary dynamic nonlinear system is incorporated to
   approximate the unknown nonlinear input-output relationship using a
   dynamic back propagation learning algorithm. Simulations for determining
   the number of modes to describe the dynamics of the system and
   investigating the robustness of the control system are carried out.
   Results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed control system.

Abstract = {{Microalbuminuria (MA) is a strong risk factor for subsequent chronic
   disease, both renal and coronary heart disease (CHD), in European origin
   populations, but CHD risks differ by ethnicity, and it was hypothesized
   that prevalence of MA and relations with CHD may also differ. Combined
   analyses of two population-based cohorts started in 1988 and consisted
   of 1460 Europeans (70\% male), 946 South Asians (78\% male), and 559
   African Caribbeans (51\% male) who resided in London and were aged 40 to
   69. Baseline fasting blood, overnight urine collection, and clinical
   measurements were performed. Prevalent CHD was defined by clinical
   history or major electrocardiogram changes. Age-adjusted albumin
   excretion rates (AER; geometric means, mu g/min) were significantly
   higher in African Caribbeans (men: 6.1, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   5.5 to 6.7; women: 5.7, 95\% CI 5.2 to 6.2) than in South Asians (men:
   4.3,95\% CI 4.0 to 4.5; women 3.4,95\% CI 3.0 to 3.8) and Europeans
   (men: 4.5,95\% CI 4.3 to 4.8; women: 3.3, 95\% CI 3.1 to 3.6). MA was
   associated with both prevalent CHD and CHD mortality in South Asian men
   (hazard ratio 2.5; 95\% CI 1.3 to 4.8) and in European women (hazard
   ratio 13.0; 95\% CI 2.6 to 64.2) but not in any other group. Greater AER
   in African Caribbeans and the absence of association with CHD contrast
   with lower AER in South Asian men and European women, both strongly
   associated with CHD prevalence and mortality. These differences suggest
   that the pathogenesis of kidney disease and its link with CHD differ by
   ethnicity and gender.}},

Abstract = {{Calorie restriction (CR) extends the life span of various species
   through mechanisms that are as yet unclear. Recently, we have reported
   that mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis was enhanced in alpha MUPA
   transgenic mice that spontaneously eat less and live longer compared
   with their wild-type (WT) control mice. To understand the molecular
   mechanisms underlying the increased apoptosis, we compared aMUPA and WT
   mice for parameters associated with SOD2 (MnSOD), a mitochondrial
   antioxidant enzyme that converts superoxide radicals into H2O2 and is
   also known to inhibit apoptosis. The SOD2-related parameters included
   the levels of SOD2 mRNA, immunoreactivity and enzymatic activity in the
   liver, lipid oxidation and aconitase activity in isolated liver
   mitochondria, and the sensitivity of the mice to paraquat, an agent that
   elicits oxidative stress. In addition, we compared the mice for the
   levels of SOD2 mRNA after treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharides
   (LPS), and for the DNA binding activity of NF kappa B as a marker for
   the inflammatory state. We extended SOD2 determination to the colon,
   where we also examined the formation of pre-neoplastic aberrant crypt
   foci (ACF) following treatment with dimethylhydrazine (DMH), a colonic
   organotypic carcinogen. Overall, alpha MUPA mice showed reduced basal
   levels of SOD2 gene expression and activity concomitantly with reduced
   lipid oxidation, increased aconitase activity and enhanced paraquat
   sensitivity, while maintaining the capacity to produce high levels of
   SOD2 in response to the inflammatory stimulus. alpha MUPA mice also
   showed increased resistance to DMH-induced pre-neoplasia. Collectively,
   these data are consistent with a model, in which an optimal fine-tuning
   of SOD2 throughout a long-term regimen of reduced eating could
   contribute to longevity, at least in the alpha MUPA mice. (c) 2005

   xylitol. Supplementation with glucose at the beginning of the
   fermentation increased the specific growth rate, biomass yield and
   volumetric productivity of xylitol compared with fermentation that used
   xylose as the sole carbon source. A mathematical model is developed for
   eventual use in predicting the product formation rate and yield. The
   model parameters were estimated from experimental observations, using a
   genetic algorithm. Batch fermentations, which were carried out with
   xylose alone and a mixture of xylose and glucose, were used to validate
   the model. The model fitted well with the experimental data of cell
   growth, substrate consumption and xylitol production.}},

   frequency of tumours and the prevalence of antibodies against

   domestic fowl (Gallus gallusf domestica), both in parents and production
   flocks from the Czech Republic. A total of 91 flocks of laying hens from
   three different slaughterhouses were examined for the presence of
   tumours. The occurrence of neoplastic lesions was found to be low.
   Although tumours occurred in 82 flocks (90.1\%), their incidence in 62
   (68.1\%) flocks was below 0.5\%, and it only exceeded one percent in 3
   flocks (3.3\%). 9 flocks (9.9\%) had no tumours. In order to determine
   the spectrum of the tumours, 14 randomly collected samples were
   histologically examined. The tumours found in hens at the end of the
   laying period showed varied histogenesis (five cases of pancreatic
   adenocarcinoma, three cases of adenocarcinoma of the oviduct, two cases
   of leiomyoma of the mesosalpinx, one case of ovarian adenocarcinoma, and
   one case of intestinal lymphoma). Two pseudommours, probably
   encapsulated egg yolks, were also found. Serologic examinations of hen

Abstract = {{A technique that can expand the number of wavelengths while keeping the
   spacing of the wavelengths constant is in great demand for
   wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) optical communications. We have
   developed such a technique by employing a fibre loop that contains a
   pulsed serrodyne modulator (i.e., a serrodyne phase modulator for pulsed
   light). The modulator shifts the envelope of the discrete spectrum while
   maintaining the mode positions of the spectrum, and the loop combines
   the shifted spectra into a broad spectrum. Using that technique, we have
   experimentally generated similar to 100 wavelengths with an equal
   spacing of 0.1 nm (or 12.5 GHz) from similar to 3 input wavelengths. In
   this article, we numerically simulate the broadening of the spectrum and
   confirm that it agrees well in shape and size with that in the
   experiment, which indicates that our theoretical model is suitable for
   understanding the experimental results. Employing the same model, we
   find that the number of wavelengths is increased markedly when the
   compensation of the fibre dispersion is achieved appropriately.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers examples from research that has interpreted
   literary works including representations of topographical landscapes, in
   order to examine the geographical and social perspectives of the author,
   and of the society in which the author was living and working. We focus
   especially on the use of representations of therapeutic landscapes in
   literature to convey the author's perceptions of the aspects of social
   and physical environments that contribute to human well-being. The novel
   entitled The country Doctor (Le Medecin de campagne) by Honore de
   Balzac, first published in 1833, is the particular focus of this paper
   and we consider this book in the context of the historical period when
   it was written and other novels of the period which also portray doctors
   and medicine in varying ways. We present an interpretation of Balzac's
   novel which focuses on four themes arising from the discussion in the
   introduction of this paper: the symbolic use of ideas of `therapeutic
   landscapes' to represent the `heroic' role of the doctor; the link
   between landscapes and ideas of medicine and health, corresponding to
   the Hippocratic heritage; the representation, through images of
   salubrious landscapes, of planning and economic development and the role
   of the leader; the significance of the contrast between the
   `therapeutic' rural world and the unhealthy urban settings found ill
   Paris. We conclude that The country Doctor is interesting because of the
   ways that it reflects the three aspects of landscape (physical, social
   and symbolic) that Gesler (1998. In: Kearns, R., Gesler W. (Eds.),
   Putting Health into Place: Landscape, Identity and Well-Being. Syracuse
   University Press, Syracuse, NY, pp. 17-35 (Chapter 2)) has identified as
   central `therapeutic' qualities. Not only does the book reflect a
   conceptual model of what a therapeutic landscape might be, but it also
   uses this landscape symbolically as an allegory for spiritual progress
   and redemption, and for medical and social advance. The novel represents
   a period of transition from traditional social values and prescientific
   medical theory towards modernization of society associated with the
   growing domination of medical science, which continued into the 20th
   century. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose Hemosiderin degenerated from intracerebral
   hematoma (ICH) can be visualized as low intensity on gradient-echo
   T2{*}-weighted (T2{*}-w) MRI, which is sensitive for hemosiderin. We
   studied the factors associated with the hemosiderin deposition on
   T2{*}-w MRI after ICH.
   Methods We analyzed T2{*}-w MRIs in 72 outpatients with past ICH (46
   males, 26 females, 28 - 89 (60.0 +/- 9.8) years old) consecutively came
   to our hospital. The odds ratio (OR) for the apparent thickness; >= 2.5
   nun of low intensity surrounding ICH cavity was estimated, using the
   time after the onset of IGH (17 weeks - 26 years), and other factors.
   Results AD of old ICHs were visible as low intensities on T2{*}-w MRI.
   Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an elevated
   ratio of the apparent thickness >= 2.5 nun of hemosiderin was found for
   the patients with time a 5 years between T2{*}-w MRI and the onset (odds
   ratio (OR): 0.24, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.06-0.99),
   intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage related to ICH (OR: 0.16,
   95\% Cl: 0.03 - 0,77), and the diameter of ICH >= 2cm (OR: 33.7, 95\%
   Cl: 4.6 - 245).
   Conclusion Though small sample size limited the power of analyses, our
   findings suggest that the amount of hemosiderin deposition after IGH may
   be associated with the time after the onset, intraventricular or
   subarachnoid hemorrhage related to ICH, and the diameter of ICH.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was carried out in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) with the
   aim of determining if the duration of the habituation period (1, 5 or 10
   days) to low and high energy density gruels affected the amounts
   consumed or the energy intakes from gruels consumed by 6-9-month-old
   infants. Thirty infants were chosen randomly among the eligible children
   in the study area and randomly assigned to two groups (S1 and S2). Each
   infant was given successively for 10 consecutive days two experimental
   gruels, each type of gruel being fed twice a day. The 15 infants in
   group S I received low energy density gruel (G 1) in the first period
   and high energy density gruel (G2) in the second, and the 15 infants in
   group S2 received G2 in the first period and G I in the second. The two
   periods of 10 days were separated by 4 days during which the infant
   received his or her usual foods. The intakes of experimental gruels and
   other complementary foods were measured on days 1, 5 and 10 of each
   period. Whatever the type of gruel, the 10-day period of habituation did
   not result in an increase in the amounts consumed or in the energy
   intakes from these gruels. The amounts of G1 consumed on day 5 were
   significantly higher than those of G2 (9.0 vs 6.8 g/kg/meal; p=0.044).
   Energy intakes from G2 were significantly higher than those from G1 on
   days 1 (28.8 vs 18.0 kJ/kg/meal; p =0.0002), 5 (28.8 vs 19.2 kJ/kg/meal;
   p = 0.002) and 10 (25.9 vs 15.5 kJ/kg/meal; p = 0.0004). Daily
   frequencies of breastfeeding (approximate to 5.6), water drinking
   (approximate to 3.7) and meals with foods other than experimental gruels
   were relatively high and did not vary with the duration of the
   habituation period or the type of gruels. Whatever the type of gruel,
   the increase in the duration of the habituation period did not increase
   the amount consumed or energy intakes. The study confirmed that
   consumption of high energy density gruels led to a 60\% increase in
   energy intakes in comparison with the consumption of low energy density
   gruels. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We investigated the role of infant bedding items, as part of
   a composite bedding environment, in the development of childhood
   wheezing.
   Methods: This prospective cohort investigation involved 863 children who
   participated in an infant survey in 1988 and an asthma study in
   Tasmania, Australia, in 1995. The derived 3 composite infant bedding
   categories corresponded to increasing numbers of house dust mite
   (HDM)-rich bedding items used. Outcomes measured included recent and
   frequent wheezing.
   Results: Composite infant bedding used was associated with recent
   wheezing. Effects increased at increasing levels of HDM-rich bedding
   items used. Effects were further enhanced by home environmental factors
   of bedroom heating, recent bedroom painting, and absence of bedroom
   carpeting. When any 2 or more of these environmental factors were
   present, a strong dose-response relationship was evident.
   Conclusions: Our results show that bedding exposures in infancy are
   prospectively associated with childhood wheezing and that home
   environmental conditions may modify this association.}},

Abstract = {{Allozyme electrophoresis was used to investigate the taxonomic status of
   northern calamary Sepioteuthis lessoniana (Lesson 1830) from two sites
   in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Of the 40 squid examined at 38

   differentiated from the rest by fixed allefic differences at four loci
   (Acp, Got2, Idh2, and PepD) and near-fixed differences at another three
   (Est, Ocdh, and 6Pgd). The genetic distances between these two groups of
   individuals (13\% Fixed Differences and Nei, D (1978) = 0.178) were
   roughly twofold greater than those between the two cryptic taxa in the
   southern calamary S. australis, but are considerably smaller than those
   between the northum and southern calamary. The most likely explanation
   for these data is that S. lessoniana comprises two ``cryptic{''}

Abstract = {{The human ERCC1/XPF complex is a structure-specific endonuclease with
   defined polarity that participates in multiple DNA repair pathways. We
   report the heterodimeric structure of the C-terminal domains of both
   proteins responsible for ERCC1/XPF complex formation. Both domains
   exhibit the double helix-hairpin-helix motif (HhH)(2), and they are
   related by a pseudo-2-fold symmetry axis. In the XPF domain, the hairpin
   of the second motif is replaced by a short turn. The ERCC1 domain folds
   properly only in the presence of the XPF domain, which implies a role
   for XPF as a scaffold for the folding of ERCC1. The intersubunit
   interactions are largely hydrophobic in nature. NMR titration data show
   that only the ERCC1 domain of the ERCC1/XPF complex is involved in DNA
   binding. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model for the
   targeting of XPF nuclease via ERCC1-mediated interactions in the context
   of nucleotide excision repair.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Chronic allograft nephropathy is the main cause of graft
   loss. Although many factors are involved in its development,
   ischemia-reperfusion injury has received increasing attention as a risk
   determinant. In a previous study of syngeneic renal transplantation and
   ischemia, we demonstrated a protective effect of acute damage by FTY 720
   and antisense oligonucleotides of ICAM-1 (Oligos). The purpose of the
   current study was to evaluate the impact of these agents on the
   development of chronic graft damage in the same model.
   Methods. Lewis rat were used as donors and recipients. The harvested
   left kidney was kept in Collins solution for 2 hours. Recipient animals
   received treatment with FTY 720 or Oligos or saline. At 12 and 36 weeks
   after transplantation, creatinine clearance, GFR, proteinuria, and
   arterial blood pressure were recorded. Tissue from some animals were
   submitted for histological studies and quantification of mRNA TGF-beta
   1.
   Results. All groups showed decreased levels of GFR and creatinine
   clearence, but only the untreated animals showed significant
   deterioration compared to the pretransplant values (0.53 +/- 0.24 versus
   0.21 +/- 0.24 at 36 weeks respectively; P < .05). Proteinuria was also
   significant in control animals at 36 weeks. Blood pressure showed a
   moderate increase in all groups. Histological analysis showed that
   treated animals had fewer signs of chronic damage according to the Banff
   score. All groups displayed slight increases in TGF-beta 1 without
   differences among them.
   Conclusions. In this model the use of FTY or antisense oligonucleotides
   of ICAM-1 were associated with less functional and morphological
   evidence of chronic graft damage secondary to an ischemia-reperfusion
   injury.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Antiretroviral tolerability is a critical factor
   contributing to treatment outcome. The T-20 Versus Optimized Background
   Regimen Only (TORO) studies assessed the safety and efficacy of
   enfuvirtide in treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients.
   Methods: A total of 997 patients were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to an
   optimized background antiretroviral regimen plus enfuvirtide (n = 663)
   or an optimized background regimen alone (control group; n = 334).
   Control patients could switch to enfuvirtide on virologic failure.
   Results: In total, 26.5\% of patients randomized to enfuvirtide and
   36.6\% to the control group discontinued study treatment before week 48;
   the percentage of patients withdrawn for safety reasons (including
   adverse events {[}AEs], deaths, and laboratory abnormalities) was 14.0\%
   in the enfuvirtide group and 11.6\% in the control group. Injection site
   reactions (ISRs) occurred in 98\% of enfuvirtide patients and led to
   treatment discontinuation in 4.4\%. Treatment-related (defined as
   possibly, probably, or remotely) AE rates per 100 patient-years were
   lower with enfuvirtide (96.2) than in the control group (149.9);
   diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue, the most frequently reported AEs, were
   significantly less frequent with enfuvirtide than in the control group.
   Pneumonia was significantly more frequent in patients treated with
   enfuvirtide (6.7 vs. 0.6 events per 100 patient-years), although the
   incidence was within expected ranges for this population.
   Lymphadenopathy was also higher in enfuvirtide-treated patients (7.1 vs.
   1.2 events per 100 patient-years) for control patients.
   Conclusion: The addition of enfuvirtide to an optimized background
   regimen does not exacerbate AEs commonly associated with
   antiretrovirals. ISRs limited treatment in <5\% of patients.}},

Abstract = {{We used the aquatic communities living in the purple pitcher plant
   (Sarracenia purpurea L., Sarraceniaceae) to determine if patterns
   produced by trophic interactions at the local scale can be detected at
   larger spatial scales. Mosquitoes (Wyeomyia smithii Coq., Diptera:
   Culicidae) are known to have a negative effect on the aquatic microfauna
   within leaves. We compared the abundance of two microfaunal taxa, Bodo
   (Kinetoplastea: Bodonidae) and Habrotrocha rosa Donner (Rotifera:
   Bdelloidea), in bogs with and without pitcher plant mosquitoes. Bogs
   containing pitcher plant mosquitoes had lower densities of bacteria
   through the study period. However, within these bogs, leaves with
   mosquitoes did not have lower bacteria] densities. We found that the
   pattern for Bodo was similar at the leaf and bog spatial scales.
   Abundance of Bodo was closely linked to bacterial densities and the
   presence of mosquitoes strengthened that relationship, because of
   greater predator impacts when bacteria were scarce. In contrast,
   different patterns emerged at the two scales for H. rosa, At the leaf
   scale, a predator effect was seen only for low bacterial densities (as
   for Bodo), but at the bog scale, H. rosa was less abundant in mosquito
   bogs, and abundance was not associated with bacterial levels. We suggest
   that differences in life history characteristics (population growth rate
   and average abundance) may influence the relative influence of local
   interactions and regional processes such as colonization.}},

Abstract = {{Population stratification may confound the results of genetic
   association studies among unrelated individuals from admixed
   populations. Several methods have been proposed to estimate the
   ancestral information in admixed populations and used to adjust the
   population stratification in genetic association tests. We evaluate the
   performances of three different methods: maximum likelihood estimation,
   ADMIXMAP and Structure through various simulated data sets and real data
   from Latino subjects participating in a genetic study of asthma. All
   three methods provide similar information on the accuracy of ancestral
   estimates and control type I error rate at an approximately similar
   rate. The most important factor in determining accuracy of the ancestry
   estimate and in minimizing type I error rate is the number of markers
   used to estimate ancestry. We demonstrate that approximately 100
   ancestry informative markers (AIMs) are required to obtain estimates of
   ancestry that correlate with correlation coefficients more than 0.9 with
   the true individual ancestral proportions. In addition, after accounting
   for the ancestry information in association tests, the excess of type 1
   error rate is controlled at the 5\% level when 100 markers are used to
   estimate ancestry. However, since the effect of admixture on the type I
   error rate worsens with sample size, the accuracy of ancestry estimates
   also needs to increase to make the appropriate correction. Using data
   from the Latino subjects, we also apply these methods to an association
   study between body mass index and 44 AlMs. These simulations are meant
   to provide some practical guidelines for investigators conducting
   association studies in admixed populations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effects of cardiac rehabilitation on the
   recovery of heart rate over 1 min after peak exercise of patients who
   received coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
   Design: Thirty subjects who received CABG surgery were randomly assigned
   to enter or not enter a cardiac rehabilitation exercise programme
   (cardiac rehabilitation n = 15; control group n = 15).
   Setting: Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation centre in a national medical
   hospital.
   Interventions: Patients assigned to the cardiac rehabilitation group
   received 36 sessions of the exercise programme, three times a week, with
   the intensity designed to achieve an individual 60-85\% peak heart rate
   in cardiopulmonary exercise test. Patients assigned to the control group
   did not get further advice about a specific exercise programme.
   Main outcome measures: Resting heart rate and recovery of heart rate
   over 1 min after a peak exercise test at discharge and three months
   later were collected. The heart rates were analysed with
   computer-recorded electrocardiogram.
   Results: At follow-up, the 15 patients in the cardiac rehabilitation
   group had a significantly lower resting heart rate (77.46 +/- 9.49
   versus 92.31 +/- 10.18 bpm; p<0.001) and a significantly higher recovery
   of heart rate over 1 min (16.38 +/- 6.32 versus 11.38 +/- 4.81 bpm; p =
   0.03) compared with the control group. There were also significant
   reductions in resting heart rates (cardiac rehabilitation p < 0.001;
   control p = 0.05) and improvements in recovery on heart rate over I min
   (cardiac rehabilitation p < 0.001; control p = 0.001) compared with

Abstract = {{Advanced process technologies have been introducing many unseen problems
   on process yield and device reliability. Microcontamination, which
   enables defects causing electric faults, has also been hard to
   understand, detect, and control. In this paper, the requirements and
   methodologies for contamination control in advanced technologies such as
   at the 90-nm processing technology node and immersion lithography using
   300-mm wafer processing were addressed. Combining techniques of vapor
   phase decomposition (VPD) and, wafer outgassing system (WOS) for
   characterizing the very low levels of surface metallic and organic
   contaminants on 300-mm wafers makes a front-end process capable of
   realizing and deploying the necessary controls. Applying liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in the identification of
   contaminants of immersion fluids is a new experience for 193-nm
   lithography technology. Furthermore, the wafer-environment contamination
   controls, such as airborne molecular contaminants (AMCs), process
   critical material assurance and point-of-use quality are reviewed in the
   paper. This paper concludes by discussing the challenges for
   characterization and control of microcontamination in future
   manufacturing technologies.}},

   The telescope has an effective area of 49 cm(2) at 30 keV, an angular
   resolution of 2.4 arcmin (HPD), and a field of view of 11 arcmin (FWHM)
   depending on energies. The CdZnTe detector is configured with a 12 x 12
   segmented array of detector pixels. The pixels are 2 mm square, and are
   placed on 2.1 mm centers. An averaged energy resolution is 4.4 keV at 60
   keV and its standard deviation is 0.36 keV over 128 pixels. The detector
   is surrounded by a 3-cm thick CsI anti coincidence shield to reduce
   background from particles and photons not incident along the mirror

Abstract = {{Internet video streaming is a widely popular application however, in
   many cases, congestion control facilities are not well integrated into
   such applications. In order to be fair to other users that do not stream
   video, rate adaptation should be performed to respond to congestion. On
   the other hand, the effect of rate adaptation on the viewer should be
   minimized and this extra mechanism should not overload the client and
   the server. In this paper, we develop a heuristic approach for unicast
   congestion control. The primary feature of our approach is the two level
   adaptation algorithm that utilizes packet loss rate as well as receiver
   buffer data to maintain satisfactory buffer levels at the receiver. This
   is particularly important if receiver has limited buffer such as in
   mobile devices. When there is no congestion, to maintain best buffer
   levels, fine grain adjustments are carried out at the packet level.
   Depending on the level of congestion and receiver buffer level, rate
   shaping that involves frame discard and finally rate adaptation by
   switching to a different pre-encoded video stream are carried out.
   Additive increase multiplicative decrease policy is maintained to
   respond to congestion in a TCP-friendly manner. The algorithm is
   implemented and performance results show that it has adaptation ability
   that is suitable for both local area and wide area networks.}},

Journal = {{ASTRONOMY REPORTS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{993-1000}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We consider the evolution of close binaries in which the initial
   secondary component is a nondegenerate helium star with mass M-He =
   0.4-60 M-., while the initially more massive primary has evolved into a
   black hole, neutron star, or degenerate dwarf. The neutron star is
   assumed to originate as a result of the evolution of a helium star with
   a mass of 2.5 M-. <= M-He <= 10 M-. after the explosion of a type lb,c
   supernova. If the axial rotation of the helium star before the explosion
   is rigid-body and synchronized with the orbital rotation, for P-orb <=
   0.16 day, the rotational energy of the young neutron star will exceed
   the energy of an ordinary supernova. If the magnetic field of the
   neutron star is sufficiently strong, the necessary conditions for a
   magnetic-rotation a supernova are provided. The initial rotational
   period of a young neutron star originating in a system with an orbital
   period shorter than similar to 50 days is shorter than similar to 4 s,
   which, according to observations, is required for the appearance of a
   radio pulsar. A helium star whose mass exceeds similar to 10 M-. in a
   close binary with an orbital period shorter than one day and with the
   axial rotation of the helium presupernova synchronous with the orbital
   rotation evolves into a Kerr black hole, whose formation is likely to be
   accompanied by a gamma-ray burst with a duration longer than two
   seconds. In particular, we consider close binaries in which the second
   supernova results in the formation of a neutron star that remains in the
   binary. The theoretical distribution of orbital periods and
   eccentricities for such systems is consistent with that observed for
   radio pulsars in the Galactic disk in binaries with compact components
   and orbital eccentricities exceeding similar to 0.09, providing an
   explanation for the observed correlation between the orbital
   eccentricities and orbital periods for these systems. (C) 2005 Pleiades

Abstract = {{Through an extensive simulation study, it is shown for the first time
   that the presence of optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs), and in
   particular the optical filtering associated with them, improves the
   overall performance of systems suffering by nonlinear effects. This is
   due to that periodic optical filtering assists in suppressing the
   spectral broadening imposed by the Kerr nonlinearity and, therefore,
   suppresses the associated penalty. Our results identified optimum
   operating regimes, in terms of launch power and OADM filter bandwidths,
   for OADM-chain wavelength-division-multiplexing systems.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer results from the interaction of genetic susceptibility and
   environmental exposures. The diagnosis of cancer is age related; there
   is a marked increase in cancer incidence after the reproductive years.
   Nutrient and toxicant exposures are important contributors to the risk
   of some cancers. Nutrition, as a determinant of growth and body
   composition, also influences cancer risk, directly due to carcinogens in
   foods or indirectly by the hormonal and metabolic response to growth and
   obesity. There is strong evidence that obesity and rapid growth enhance
   the risk of cancer. The prevention of cancer should start before
   conception; mothers should start pregnancy with a healthy weight and
   avoid excessive or low weight gain during pregnancy. Key micronutrients
   are important for normal embryonic development and fetal growth. Infant
   growth should be assessed based on optimal health across all stages of
   the life course, rather than following the present approach of ``bigger
   is better.{''} This model may increase cancer risk in later life,
   because bigger is closely linked to fatter. Recent studies of energy
   expenditure in children indicate that excess energy intakes may have
   been recommended over the past decades, contributing to the surge in
   global obesity. Food preferences and habits regarding physical activity
   and play become set relatively early in life; parents and teachers
   provide key guidance leading to the adoption of a healthy or an
   unhealthy lifestyle. Thus, cancer prevention efforts should begin with
   childhood and continue through all stages of the life course.}},

Abstract = {{Two different types of scrap tires, passenger car tire (PCT) and truck
   tire (TT) with waste lubricant oil (WLO) were copyrolyzed in a fixed bed
   reactor at the temperatures of 550, 650 and 800 degrees C under nitrogen
   atmosphere. Copyrolysis products were investigated comparatively. The
   gaseous products were analyzed by GC-TCD. The psychical and chemical
   properties of copyrolysis oils were characterized by means of ASTM
   methods, GC-FID, GC-MS, and H-1 NMR. In addition, boiling point
   distributions of hydrocarbons in copyrolysis oils were determined by
   using simulated distillation curves in comparison with commercial
   diesel. An increase in the temperature had no effect on the product
   distributions of copyrolysis and the composition of copyrolysis oils.
   However, the types of scrap tires strongly effected the product
   distributions and compositions of copyrolysis oils. Copyrolysis of
   PCT/WLO produced less amount of liquid and more amount of solid residue
   than that of copyrolysis of TT/WLO. However, the naphtha and aromatic
   content in oils from copyrolysis of PCT/WLO was found more than that of
   TT/WLO. The amount of aromatic content in copyrolysis oils found to be
   less than that of scrap tire derived oils. By comparing the copyrolysis
   oils with commercial diesel, copyrolysis oils contained lighter fraction
   than that of commercial diesel whereas the specific gravities and
   viscosities of copyrolysis oils were higher than that of commercial
   diesel. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents some recent advances in the dynamics and control of
   constrained multibody systems. The constraints considered need not
   satisfy the D'Alembert principle and therefore the results are of
   general applicability. They show that, in the presence of constraints,
   the constraint force acting on the multibody system can always be viewed
   as made up of the sum of two components whose explicit form is provided.
   The first of these components consists of the constraint force that
   would have existed were all the constraints ideal; the second is caused
   by the nonideal nature of the constraints, and though it needs
   specification by the mechanician who is modeling the specific system at
   hand, it has a specific form. The general equations of motion obtained
   herein provide new insights into the simplicity with which Nature seems
   to operate. They point toward the development of new and novel
   approaches for the exact control of complex multibody nonlinear systems.}},

Abstract = {{During the stationary phase of Escherichia coli growth, ribosomal
   structure changes drastically. Proteins RMF, YhbH, YfiA and SRA are
   expressed and bind to ribosome particles. In a process named `ribosomal
   hibernation,' RMF binding induces the dimerization and subsequent
   inactivation of 70S ribosomes. Here, we examined the functions of YhbH
   and YfiA in the formation of 70S dimers using deletion mutants of YhbH
   and YfiA. The yfiA deletion mutant expressed YhbH and RMF in the
   stationary phase and formed a greater number of 100S particles than the
   wild-type, showing that YhbH promotes and stabilizes 100S formation. In
   contrast, the yhbH deletion mutant expressed YfiA and RMF and produced
   no 70S dimers, suggesting that YfiA prevents 70S dimer formation. Thus,
   YhbH and YfiA have opposite functions in 70S dimer formation. YhbH and
   YfiA share 40\% sequence homology, suggesting that their binding sites
   overlap and they compete for a region proximal to the P- and A-sites on
   30S subunits. In the yhbH and yfiA double deletion mutant, which
   expresses only RMF, 70S dimers were observed as 90S particles. Since
   100S particles were seen in the yfiA deletion mutant containing RMF and
   YhbH, YhbH probably converts immature 90S ribosomes into mature 100S
   particles.}},

   the vast majority of non-specific contaminating RNA, which can bind to

Abstract = {{The effect of a short loop connecting two transmembrane alpha-helices
   was studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Helices F and G from
   bacteriorhodopsin and two corresponding polyalanine helices were
   embedded in octane and POPC membranes in a transmembrane configuration
   both with and without the inter-helical loop. The results indicate that
   the membrane environment and the sequence of the loop are more
   influential on the dynamics and structure of the motif than the presence
   of a loop as such, at least for the time-scales investigated. The four
   residues in the FG loop are stabilized by four hydrogen bonds. These
   hydrogen bonds are not present in the polyalanine loop, causing it to be
   more flexible than the FG loop. This effect was observed independently
   of the protein environment, stressing the importance of the sequence.
   The structural analysis indicates that the loop has weak stabilizing
   properties in all environments. The stabilization due to the presence of
   the loop was strongest in a simulation of the FG fragment in a
   membrane-mimetic octane slab. In the simulations of the helix-loop-helix
   motif embedded in an explicit lipid bilayer model, the lipid bilayer
   interface compensates to a large extent for the absence of the loop.}},

Abstract = {{Arteriovenous (AV) grafts and fistulas used for hemodialysis frequently
   develop intimal hyperplasia (IH) at the venous anastomosis of the graft,
   leading to flow-limiting stenosis, and ultimately to graft failure due
   to thrombosis. Although the high AV access blood flow has been
   implicated in the pathogenesis of graft stenosis, the potential role of
   needle turbulence during hemodialysis is relatively unexplored. High
   turbulent stresses from the needle jet that reach the venous anastomosis
   may contribute to endothelial denudation and vessel wall injury. This
   may trigger the molecular and cellular cascade involving platelet
   activation and 1H, leading to eventual graft failure. In an in-vitro
   graft/needle model dye injection flow visualization was used for
   qualitative study of flow patterns, whereas laser Doppler velocimetry
   was used to compare the levels of turbulence at the venous anastomosis
   in the presence and absence of a venous needle jet. Considerably higher
   turbulence was observed downstream of the venous needle, in comparison
   to graft flow alone without the needle. While turbulent RMS remained
   around 0.1 m/s for the graft flow alone, turbulent RMS fluctuations
   downstream of the needle soared to 0.4-0.7 m/s at 2 cm from the tip of
   the needle and maintained values higher than 0.1 m/s up to 7-8 cm
   downstream. Turbulent intensities were 5-6 times greater in the presence
   of the needle, in comparison with graft flow alone. Since hemodialysis
   patients are exposed to needle turbulence for four hours three times a
   week, the role of postvenous needle turbulence may be important in the
   pathogenesis of AV graft complications. A better understanding of the
   role of needle turbulence in the mechanisms of AV graft failure may lead
   to improved design of AV grafts and venous needles associated with
   reduced turbulence, and to pharmacological interventions that attenuate
   1H and graft failure resulting from turbulence.}},

Abstract = {{The TRAP220 subunit of the thyroid hormone receptor-associated
   polypeptide transcription coactivator complex (TRAP/Mediator complex),
   mammalian counterpart of the yeast Mediator complex, is proposed to act
   on a variety of major and specific biological events through physical
   interactions with nuclear receptors. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) and
   retinoic acid receptor (RAR), coupled with retinoid X receptor (RXR),
   are nuclear receptors which have important roles for monopoiesis and
   granulopoiesis, respectively. In this study, we present the functional
   role of TRAP220 in nuclear receptor-mediated monopoiesis and
   granulopoiesis. The mouse Trap220(-/-) yolk sac hematopoietic progenitor
   cells were resistant to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3-stimulated
   differentiation into monocytes/macrophages. Furthermore, flow cytometric
   analyses showed that HL-60 cells, human promyelocytic leukemia cell
   line, wherein TRAP220 was down-regulated, did not differentiate
   efficiently into monocytes and granulocytes by stimulation with
   1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 and all-trans retinoic acid, correspondingly.
   The expression of direct target genes of VDR or RAR, as well as the
   differentiation marker genes, was low in the knockdown cells. These
   results indicated a crucial role of TRAP220 in the optimal VDR- and
   RAR-mediated myelomonocytic differentiation processes in mammalian
   hematopoiesis.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Paracetamol-containing combination analgesics are widely prescribed
   but the use of paracetamol/dextropropoxyphene (co-proxamol) is
   particularly controversial. We aim to examine the prescribing patterns
   of the paracetamol-containing analgesics in Ireland.
   Methods A national primary care prescribing database was used to
   investigate patterns of usage. Twenty-six thousand three hundred and
   eighteen patients who were new to therapy with paracetamol and
   paracetamol-containing analgesics between January and June 2002 were
   identified as follows: no previous analgesic medication in the 6 months
   prior to enrolment into the study, and followed up for at least 12
   months from the time of enrolment. Duration of therapy and the number of
   prescriptions received post enrolment were analyzed according to age.
   Odds ratios for receiving long-term (> 1 month) compared with short-term
   (1 month) prescriptions for co-proxamol, paracetamol only or a
   paracetamol combination-type analgesic were calculated for women vs.
   men, and in those aged over 65 vs. those aged under 65 years.
   Results Co-proxamol was the most commonly prescribed analgesic,
   accounting for 42\% of all prescriptions dispensed during 2003.
   Long-term use of paracetamol-containing analgesic preparations was
   uncommon, with 56.7\% receiving only 1 month's prescription during the
   study period. However, women (OR = 1.18, 95\% CI 1.07, 1.28, P < 0.0001)
   and those over 65 years (OR = 1.71, 95\% CI 1.57, 1.86, P < 0.0001) were
   more likely to receive a follow-up prescription for co-proxamol, but
   also for paracetamol (women, OR = 1.28, 95\% CI 1.16, 1.39; over 65 year
   olds, OR = 2.67, 95\%CI 2.44, 2.93) and the paracetamol combinations
   (women, OR = 1.33, 95\% CI 1.20, 1.47; over 65 year olds, OR = 1.69,
   95\% CI 1.53, 1.87).
   Conclusions Co-proxamol was the most commonly prescribed
   paracetamol-containing analgesic preparation in Ireland. The results may
   indicate inappropriate use in primary care.}},

Abstract = {{U6+-phases are common alteration products, under oxidizing conditions,

   subjected to a radiation field caused by the alpha-decay of U, or in the
   case of spent nuclear fuel, incorporated actinides, such as Pu-239 and
   Np-237. In order to evaluate the effects of alpha-decay events on the
   stability of the U6+-phases, we report, for the first time, the results
   of ion beam irradiations (1.0 McV Kr2+) of U6+-phases. The
   heavy-particle irradiations are used to simulate the ballistic
   interactions of the recoil-nucleus of an a-decay event with the
   surrounding structure. The Kr2+-irradiation decomposed the U6+-phases to
   UO2 nanocrystals at doses as low as 0.006 displacements per atom (dpa).
   U6+-phases accumulate substantial radiation doses (similar to 1.0
   displacement per atom) within 100,000 yr if the concentration of
   incorporated Pu-239 is as high as 1 wt.\%. Similar nanocrystals of UO2
   were observed in samples from the natural fission reactors at Oklo,
   Gabon. Multiple cycles of radiation-induced decomposition to UO2
   followed by alteration to U-64-phases provide a mechanism for the
   remobilization of incorporated radionuclides. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: The objective of this randomized, double-blind, controlled
   crossover trial was to compare 0.1\% timolol hydrogel formulation
   eyedrops with 0.5\% timolol aqueous solution in terms of systemic
   effects, hypotensive efficacy and pharmacodynamics.
   Methods: Twenty-four healthy subjects underwent careful ocular,
   cardiovascular and pulmonary function evaluation before and after 2
   weeks of topical treatment with 0.1\% timolol hydrogel or 0.5\% aqueous
   timolol maleate. Intraocular pressure (IOP), heart rate, blood pressure,
   forced expiratory volume and plasma levels of timolol were measured.
   Results: There was a statistically significant difference in the
   systemic absorption of timolol between these two ophthalmic timolol
   solutions. The peak concentration and mean area under the plasma drug
   concentration-time curve (AUC) were about 10-fold higher after 0.5\%
   timolol aqueous solution. The mean peak heart rate during exercise was
   reduced by 19 bpm (SD 6.4 bpm) after 0.5\% timolol aqueous solution and
   by only 4.6 bpm (SD 3.8 bpm) after 0.1\% timolol hydrogel (p < 0.0001).
   There was no difference between the two formulations in efficacy in
   reducing IOP. No differences between treatments were found in respect of
   pulmonary function.
   Conclusion: The lower timolol concentration in the hydrogel vehicle and
   its better bioavailability resulted in reduced systemic absorption and
   side-effects without loss of efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were (1) to establish cephalometric norms from
   submentovertex (SMV) radiographs for young Anatolian Turkish adults and
   (2) to identify possible sex differences between men and women. Methods:
   SMV cephalograms were taken of 50 nongrowing Turkish adults (25 men,
   mean age, 23.06 +/- 2.30 years; 25 women, mean age, 22.10 +/- 2.04
   years). All had normal occlusions and well-balanced faces. Five angular
   and 10 linear measurements were made on each radiograph. For each
   variable, arithmetic mean and standard deviation minimum and maximum
   values were calculated. Independent-sample t tests were performed for
   the sex comparisons. Cephalometric angular and linear norms for Turkish
   adults were determined by using the Lew-Tay SMV cephalometric analysis.
   SMV cephalometric standards for Turkish adults were also developed.
   Results: Generally, our measurements were similar to the Lew-Tay SMV
   norms. Most Turkish SMV cephalometric measurements showed statistically
   significant sex differences. Comparison between Turkish men and women
   indicated larger measurements for men in all investigated linear
   measurements. Conclusions: SMV cephalometric norms are useful in the
   diagnosis of mandibular asymmetries and the treatment of dentofacial
   orthopedics in Turkish patients.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies on decomposition dynamics indicate that the decomposition
   pattern can be divided in a first rapid phase following a negative
   exponential model, controlled by nutrient concentration; and a second
   slow phase controlled by lignified carbohydrates, in which the curve
   acquires an asymptotic form as decomposition slows down. This pattern
   has been observed across different floras, but there are still
   contradictory evidences about which are the most accurate predictors of
   each decomposition phase. The objectives of this study were: (1) to
   determine decomposition during the two main phases throughout one year
   of incubation, of 20 abundant plant species from 7 contrasting plant
   functional types of a mountain woodland in central Argentina, and (2) to
   analyse the relationship of decomposition with foliar traits (both of
   green leaves and litter), in order to identify the more accurate
   predictors of the first and the second decomposition phases, as well as
   for annual decomposition. Decomposition was measured as the percentage
   of remaining dry weight (\% RDW) at the end of each phase. As expected,
   decomposition was much slower (\% RDW higher) during the second phase
   (70-365 days) than during the first one (0-70 days). The \% RDW of the
   first phase was significantly and strongly associated with the \% RDW of
   the whole incubation period. Through a stepwise multiple regression
   procedure we detected that the best predictors of \% RDW for the first
   phase were the sum of recalcitrant components (lignin, cellulose and
   hemicellulose) of the litter with a negative relation, and specific leaf
   area of green leaves with a positive relation (R-2 = 0.89). For the
   whole year incubation results were quite similar to those recorded for
   the first phase (R-2 = 0.78). The second phase was not predicted by any
   of the traits measured. In general, our results agree with previous
   studies in which decomposition was tightly related to the
   physico-chemical characteristics of green leaves and litter. However,
   our results diverge from the idea that rapid and slow phases are
   controlled by labile and recalcitrant components, respectively, and
   suggest that more comparative studies are necessary to find a
   decomposition model suitable to different floras.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was undertaken to model the sequence of events
   that occurs after amnioreduction, laser therapy, and digoxin
   administration in twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) with and without
   a hydropic recipient twin.
   Study design: We added amnioreduction, laser therapy.. and digoxin
   administration to our mathematical TTTS model and simulated combinations
   of these therapies.
   Results: With a nonhydropic recipient, simulated amnioreduction delays
   the onset of hydrops. Conversely, with a hydropic recipient,
   amnioreduction aggravates the degree of hydrops. Furthermore,
   amnioreduction increases the transplacental fluid flow and may
   temporarily cause a hydropic donor. Laser therapy terminates the cause
   of recipient hydrops. Digoxin reduces the degree of recipient hydrops,
   but increases arteriovenous fetofetal transfusion.
   Conclusion: Laser therapy is superior in TTTS with a hydropic recipient,
   because simulated amnioreduction aggravates the recipient's
   cardiovascular status. Digoxin benefits a hydropic recipient but
   slightly worsens the donor's condition. Therefore, TTTS presenting with
   a hydropic recipient prior to fetal viability (similar to 26 weeks) may
   be best treated with laser therapy, whereas more advanced gestations may
   be offered digoxin administration plus amnioreduction, to delay the
   progression of TTTS. (c) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In sub-Saharan Africa, amphibians are represented by a large number of
   endemic frog genera and species of incompletely clarified phylogenetic
   relationships. This applies especially to African frogs of the family
   Ranidae. We provide a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for ranids,
   including 11 of the 12 African endemic genera. Analysis of nuclear
   (rag-1, rag-2, and rhodopsin genes) and mitochondrial markers (12S and
   16S ribosomal RNA genes) provide evidence for an endemic clade of
   African genera of high morphological and ecological diversity thus far
   assigned to up to five different subfamilies: Afrana, Cacosternum,
   Natalobatrachus, Pyxi-cephalus, Strongylopus, and Tomopterna. This clade
   has its highest species diversity in southern Africa, suggesting a
   possible biogeographic connection with the Cape Floral Region. Bayesian
   estimates of divergence times place the initial diversification of the
   southern African ranid clade at similar to 62-85 million years ago,
   concurrent with the onset of the radiation of Afrotherian mammals. These
   and other African ranids (Conraua, Petropedetes, Phrynobatrachus, and
   Pytchadena) are placed basally within the Ranoidae with respect to the
   Eurasian groups, which suggests an African origin for this whole
   epifamily. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is written in honour to A. Hordijk. It establishes product
   form results for a generic and instructive multi-class tandem queue with
   blocking, to which A. Hordijk has directly and indirectly contributed.
   First, a sufficient and necessary product form characterization is
   provided. Next, three special cases are briefly presented. These
   illustrate the possibility of product forms despite finite capacity
   constraints (blocking), unproportional processor sharing mechanisms and
   resource contentions (such as for access control).
   The results are partially new and of interest for present-day
   applications. In essence these rely upon the pioneering work by A.
   Hordijk.}},

Abstract = {{Belgian forests covered 693 181 ha in 2000, representing 22.7\% of the
   total land area. As no biomass or carbon stock data are included in the
   Flemish and Walloon regional forest inventories, species-specific wood
   densities, biomass expansion factors s. s. and carbon content values
   were critically selected from the literature. Based on these conversion
   and expansion factors, and on data from the forest inventories, the
   total C-stock in the living biomass of productive Belgian forests was
   assessed at 60.9 Mt C in the year 2000. The overall mean C-stock
   amounted to 101.0 t C ha(-1). This value was in the higher range of
   values reported for the neighbouring countries, mainly due to a high
   mean growing stock in the Belgian forests (261.9 m(3) ha(-1)). The
   conversion from wood volume to wood biomass based on wood density values
   reported in the literature appeared to introduce the largest variability
   in the assessment of the carbon stocks. Additional measurements of wood
   densities in Belgian forests could help to reduce the uncertainty
   related to this factor. Because of the time-consuming and destructive
   character of the determination of biomass expansion factors s. s.
   (BEFs), the establishment of new BEFs does not have the highest priority
   in the framework of improving the assessment of the biomass carbon stock
   in the Belgian forests. As the median C-content value for all species
   except beech was equal to the default IPCC-value of 50\% carbon in dry
   matter, it seems appropriate to use this value for future calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Because adenosine is commonly used for inducing maximal coronary
   hyperemia in the clinic, it is imperative that adenosine- induced
   hyperemia ( AH) resembles coronary hyperemia that can be attained by
   endogenous stimuli. In the present study we hypothesized that coronary
   reactive hyperemia ( RH) is limited compared with AH due to the presence
   of the glycocalyx and that the AH response is therefore unable to detect
   glycocalyx modifications. In anesthetized open- chest dogs, blood flow
   and pressure were measured in the left circumflex artery. RH after 15- s
   occlusion was compared with an intracoronary infusion of adenosine ( 650
   mu g; AH) during control conditions and after intracoronary treatment of
   the glycocalyx with hyaluronidase ( 20.000 U, 2 x 20 min; n = 6) or
   heat- inactivated hyaluronidase ( n = 5). During control, coronary
   conductance during RH was 1.49 +/- 0.15 ml center dot mmHg(-1). min(-1)
   and 76 +/- 7\% of coronary conductance during AH ( P < 0.05). After
   hyaluronidase, RH conductance increased ( P < 0.01) by 43 +/- 13\% and
   became 93 +/- 4\% of AH conductance ( P = NS). Heat-inactivated
   hyaluronidase had no effect on RH and AH conductance. Our results
   demonstrate that adenosine- induced coronary hyperemia profoundly
   exceeds RH and that the difference is virtually abolished on selective
   removal of the glycocalyx. It is concluded that, compared with RH,
   adenosine- induced coronary hyperemia is not affected by modification of
   the glycocalyx. This glycocalyx insensitivity should be taken into
   account when using adenosine- induced coronary hyperemia as a marker for
   vasodilating capacity to an ischemic stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) in acute liver failure (ALF)
   is controversial as a result of the reported complication risk (similar
   to 20\%) and limited therapeutic options for intracranial hypertension.
   Using prospectively collected information from 332 patients with ALF and
   severe encephalopathy, we evaluated a recent experience with ICP
   monitoring in the 24 centers constituting the U.S. ALF Study Group.
   Special attention was given to the rate of complications, changes in
   management, and outcome after liver transplantation (LT). ICP monitoring
   was used in 92 patients (28\% of the cohort), but the frequency of
   monitoring differed between centers (P < 0.001). ICP monitoring was
   strongly associated with the indication of LT (P < 0.001). A survey
   performed in a subset of 58 patients with ICP monitoring revealed
   intracranial hemorrhage in 10.3\% of the cohort, half of the
   complications being incidental radiological findings. However,
   intracranial bleeding could have contributed to the demise of 2
   patients. In subjects listed for LT, ICP monitoring was associated with
   a higher proportion of subjects receiving vasopressors and ICP-related
   medications. The 30-day survival post-LT was similar in both monitored
   and non-monitored groups (85\% vs. 85\%). In conclusion, the risk of
   intracranial hemorrhage following ICP monitoring may have decreased in
   the last decade, but major complications are still present. In the
   absence of ICP monitoring, however, patients listed for LT appear to be
   treated less aggressively for intracranial hypertension. In view of the
   high 30-day survival rate after LT, future studies of the impact of
   intracranial hypertension should also focus on long-term neurological
   recovery from ALF.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of a food-grade long-chain polyphosphate mixture on the
   growth and survival of spoilage micro-organisms during storage in an
   experimental processed cheese spread formulation was evaluated. The
   emulsifying salt was added to tire cheese blend at a concentration of
   0.5\% or 1.0\%. A control product was also manufactured, which contained
   monophosphate instead of polyphosphate as emulsifying salt, with all
   other ingredients being identical to those in the experimental processed
   cheese spread. Half of the finished products were subjected to
   accelerated shelf-life testing at 37 degrees C for 10 days, whereas the
   other half of them was stored refrigerated at 4 degrees C for 120 days.
   Microbiological analyses (enumeration of viable cell counts, mesophilic
   sulphite-reducing clostridia, coliforms, yeasts and moulds) and sensory
   tests were performed at regular intervals. The results showed that
   polyphosphates had a beneficial effect on the shelf-life of the
   processed cheese spread tested in that they significantly reduced (P <
   0.05) the growth or survival rates of spoilage bacteria, especially of
   mesophilic sulphite-reducing clostridia. Polyphosphates also
   beneficially influenced the sensory, including textural properties of
   the experimental processed cheese spread. All the samples containing
   less than 1\% polyphosphate showed signs of butyric blowing
   significantly earlier (P < 0.05), during both accelerated shelf-life
   tests and regular refrigerated storage, than did the products fortified
   with 1\% polyphosphate. In conclusion, the suitability of the long-chain
   polyphosphate formulation tested for shelf life extension of processed
   cheese spreads was demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the lifetime prevalence of dental pain among
   Maryland's school age children.
   Methods: Data come from the Survey of Oral Health Status of Maryland
   School Children conducted in 2000-01. History of dental pain, as
   reported by an adult respondent, was analyzed for 2,411 kindergarten and
   third grade students. Percentages with their 95\% confidence interval
   were calculated to obtain state representation of the distribution of
   dental pain by sociodemographic characteristics and caries status.
   Results: Overall, 11.8 percent of Maryland school age children in
   kindergarten and third grade have had some dental pain. Among children
   who have had caries, the report of dental pain increases to 28.2
   percent. Children from families with low educational attainment or
   eligible for free or reduced meals or covered by Medicaid were more
   likely to have experienced dental pain.
   Conclusion: Almost a third of Maryland kindergartens and third graders
   who have caries have experienced dental pain.}},

Abstract = {{Given a large number (the ``flock{''}) of moving physical objects, we
   investigate physically reasonable mechanisms of influencing their orbits
   in such a way that they move along a prescribed course and in a
   prescribed and fixed configuration (or ``in formation{''}). Each agent
   is programmed to see the position and velocity of a certain number of
   others. This flow of information from one agent to another defines a
   fixed directed (loopless) graph in which the agents are represented by
   the vertices. This graph is called the communication graph. To be able
   to fly in formation, an agent tries to match the mean position and
   velocity of his neighbors (his direct antecedents on the communication
   graph) to his own. This operation defines a (directed) Laplacian on the
   communication graph. A linear feedback is used to ensure stability of
   the coherent flight patterns. We analyze in detail how the connectedness
   of the communication graph affects the coherence of the stable flight
   patterns and give a characterization of these stable flight patterns. We
   do the same if in addition the flight of the flock is guided by one or
   more leaders. Finally we use this theory to develop some applications.
   Examples of these are: flight guided by external controls, flocks of
   flocks, and some results about flocks whose formation is always oriented
   along the line of flight (such as geese).}},

Abstract = {{Subunit heterogeneity within a particular subunit in hemoglobin A have
   been explored with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy using
   the nitrosyl hemes in Ni-Fe hybrid Hb under various solution conditions.
   Our previous studies on the crystal structure of NiHb demonstrated the
   presence of subunit heterogeneity within (alpha-subunit. To further
   cross check this hypothesis, we made a hybrid Hb in which either the
   alpha- or beta-subunit contains iron, which alone can bind to NO. By
   this way dynamic exchange between penta- and hexa-coordinated forms
   within a subunit was confirmed. Upon the addition of inositol hexa
   phosphate (IHP) to these hybrids, R to T state transition is observed
   for {[}alpha(2)(Fe-NO)beta(2)(Ni)] but such a direct transformation is
   less marked in {[}beta(2)(Ni)beta(2)(Fe-NO)]. Hence the bond between
   N-epsilon and Fe is fundamental to the structure-function relation in
   Hb, as the motion of this nitrogen triggers the vast transformation,
   which occurs in the whole molecule on attachment of NO. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Mutations in nucleophosmin NPM1 are the most frequent acquired molecular
   abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We determined the NPM1
   mutation status in a clinically and molecularly well-characterized
   patient cohort of 275 patients with newly diagnosed AML by denaturing
   high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC). We show that NPM1
   mutations are significantly underrepresented in patients younger than 35
   years. NPM1 mutations positively correlate with AML with high white
   blood cell counts, normal karyotypes, and fms-like tyrosine kinase-3
   gene (FLT3) internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations. NPM1 mutations
   associate inversely with the occurrence of CCAAT/enhancer-binding
   protein-alpha (CEBPA) and NRAS mutations. With respect to gene
   expression profiling, we show that AML cases with an NPM1 mutation
   cluster in specific subtypes of AML with previously established gene
   expression signatures, are highly associated with a homeobox
   gene-specific expression signature, and can be predicted with high
   accuracy. We demonstrate that patients with intermediate cytogenetic
   risk AML without FLT3 ITD mutations but with NPM1 mutations have a
   significantly better overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS)
   than those without NPM1 mutations. Finally, in multivariable analysis
   NPM1 mutations express independent favorable prognostic value with
   regard to OS, EFS, and disease-free survival (DFS).}},

   in his description of hysteria. Nevertheless, all the patients that
   showed these symptoms were diagnosed as hysteric. Nowadays, the clinical
   scenery is substituting the term of hysteria in favour of its components
   and giving it different names Such as dissociative disorder, conversive
   disorder, and disorder caused by somatic symptoms of somatoform. Other
   terms Such as ``functional somatic syndrome{''} or ``medically
   unexplainable symptoms{''} have been added to the list. In spite of
   these denominations no explanation has been given to the etiology of
   hysteria.
   Each medical specialty has to contend with some functional somatic
   syndrome: gastroenterology Presents irritable colon; cardiology,
   precordial pain; neurology, tensional cephatalgia; stomatology presents
   tempomandibular dysfunction, and ginecology, chronic pelvic pain. Lumbar
   pain is present in orthopedia, chronic fatigue in cases of
   infectiousness, and finally, in rheumatology, there is Fibromyalgia. In
   spite of their differences, these symptoms have some likenesses: the),
   are associated to depression and anxiety, and have a high co-morbidity
   with personality disorders; patients show major emotional distress,
   the), share stories of either psychological, physical Or Sexual abuse
   during childhool, and suffer from some type of chronic pain. Although
   having visited several specialists in their search for explanations and
   treatment, results have been poor and patients have been labelled, in a
   pejorative way, as hysteric or hxpochondriac. When diagnosed with any of
   these syndromes, patients' stress is reduced while having to face the
   invisible, uncontrollable and unpredictable fact implied by Suffering
   from the symptoms that are typical. In particular, fibromyalgia
   assemble's all the characteristics mentioned above. Turk and Cathebras
   proposed that establishment and exacerbation of the main symptoms of
   fibromyalgia (pain and fatigue) still constitute and model of respondent
   conditioning and that repeated exposure to certain stimulus generalizes
   learning. Also, the), affirm that the same symptoms create later a cycle
   that perpetuates fibromyalgia. Once that symptom have been installed and
   strengthened, patients avoid all kind of activities, they get involved
   in legal procedures to obtain leave or else, the), look for labour
   prerogatives. Besides, patients with fibromyalgia show the classic
   behaviour described for hysteria: ``belle indifference{''}, secondary
   advantages, dramatizing, Warning for their sufferings events which are
   out of their daily routine, and scarce tolerance. The purpose of this
   study is to present quantitatively, in patients diagnosed with
   fibromyalgia, the following agents: symptoms severity, prevalent
   personality, co-morbidity with personality disorders, and degree of
   severity of depression and anxiety Qualitatively, we wish to demonstrate
   the presence of the cycle that sustains the given symptoms.
   Participants: Ten patients with fibromyalgia participated in Our study,
   9 women and 1 man, diagnosed according to the criteria of the American
   College of Rheumatology, aged 37.9 +/- 8.8 and with a medium time of
   evolution of 3 (2-23) years. Quantitative variables: Physical status,
   and syndrome's severity were assessed using the Fibromyalgia Impact
   Questionnaire (FIQ); for personality,, disorders were evaluated with the
   Revised Personality Diagnose Questionnaire (PIDQ-R); depression, with
   Beck's Inventory, and anxiety with Spielberger's Trait State Inventory.
   Qualitative theoretical focus: Life experiences narrated by patients in
   their daily record of events, emotions and thoughts associated with
   pain, are presented.
   Procedure: All patients were evaluated individually at the beginning of
   a cognitive behavioural intervention. Qualitative data was obtained from
   daily records kept during at least three weeks or a maximum of 12. Texts
   were transcribed and the words most mentioned were identified, as well
   as those scarcely reported, thus propitiating descriptive categories.
   Results: The American College of Rheumatology established as one of the
   diagnose criteria for Fibromyalgia, the presence of al least 11 of a
   total of IS hypersensitive sites. Patients presented in average 16.3 +/-
   2.5 painful sites. Incapability was measured bN patients in 2.3 +/- 2.2
   in a scale oFO to 3 points; they reported to have felt well 1.1 +/- 1.2
   days per \%veck; they didn't work 1.0 +/- 1.1 days per week. The
   following measures are reported in scale from I to 10 points. Laboural
   interference was calculated in 7.3 +/- 2.3; intensity of pain was 8.1
   +/- 1.4, day long fatigue, 8.4 +/- 1.9, morning fatigue was 8.5 +/- 2.3.
   Rigidity was 7.5 +/- 3.0; anxiety perceived, 7.5 +/- 2.6 (FIQ), and
   anxiety ``rate along 12 weeks was 38.5 +/- 10.3. Anxiety trait during
   the same period was 50.9 +/- 9.7; perceived depression, 6.9 +/- 3.4
   (FIQ), and cognitive depression 14.7 +/- 5. In the scale of personality
   it was found that six patients reached punctuations higher than T60 in
   neuroticism, and two other punctuated below T40 in extroversion.
   Regarding personality disorders it was found in average for 1.8 +/- 1.1
   disorders per. patient; those more frequent were the following:
   histrionic (4), borderline (3), passive aggressive (2) and schizoid (2).
   Qualitative data Support the existence of the typical symptoms described
   for hysteria.
   Conclusions: According to the results obtained from the quantitative
   analysis of this group of patients with fibromyalgia, we can conclude
   that they suffer from a disorder that generates major incapability
   accompanied of pain and fatigue. Nevertheless, their personality
   characteristics show that they have high levels of neuroticism with
   presence of personality disorders and at the same time important levels
   of depression and anxiety, predominating in the Former, anxiety as a
   trait. Manifestations described by patients in their daily record of
   events, emotions and thoughts associated with pain and fatigue, confirm
   the presence of the classic symptoms that typified the construct of
   hysteria. These patients are vulnerable to their Surroundings, have a
   story, of childhood sufferings, and assumed an adult role from a very
   early age. Symptoms appear to be the only mechanism which at a given
   moment in life allowed them to get rid of the responsibilities that
   burdened them from childhood. Unfortunately, this symptom was associated
   to their environmenr, according to the laws of learning. It is concluded
   that fibromyalgia, as nosologic entity accomplishes the characteristics
   of hysteria, although as ctiology it is established by learning.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) onboard satellites is the only source of
   directional wave spectra with continuous and global coverage. Millions
   of SAR Wave Mode (SWM) imagettes have been acquired since the launch in
   the early 1990's of the first European Remote Sensing Satellite ERS-1
   and its successors ERS-2 and ENVISAT, which has opened up many
   possibilities specially for wave data assimilation purposes. The main
   aim of data assimilation is to improve the forecasting introducing
   available observations into the modeling procedures in order to minimize
   the differences between model estimates and measurements. However there
   are limitations in the retrieval of the directional spectrum from SAR
   images due to nonlinearities in the mapping mechanism. The Max-Planck
   Institut (MPI) scheme, the first proposed and most widely used algorithm
   to retrieve directional wave spectra from SAR images, is employed to
   compare significant wave heights retrieved from ERS-1 SAR against buoy
   measurements and against the WAM wave model. It is shown that for
   periods shorter than 12 seconds the WAM model performs better than the
   MPI, despite the fact that the model is used as first guess to the MPI
   method, that is the retrieval is deteriorating the first guess. For
   periods longer than 12 seconds, the part of the spectrum that is
   directly measured by SAR, the performance of the MPI scheme is at least
   as good as the WAM model.}},

Title = {{Heuristic approach to the Schwarzschild geometry}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2051-2067}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this article I present a simple Newtonian heuristic for motivating a
   weak-field approximation for the spacetime geometry of a point particle.
   The heuristic is based on Newtonian gravity, the notion of local
   inertial frames (the Einstein equivalence principle), plus the use of
   Galilean coordinate transformations to connect the freely falling local
   inertial frames back to the ``fixed stars.{''} Because of the heuristic
   and quasi-Newtonian manner in which the specific choice of spacetime
   geometry is motivated, we are at best justified in expecting it to be a
   weak-field approximation to the true spacetime geometry. However, in the
   case of a spherically symmetric point mass the result is coincidentally
   an exact solution of the full vacuum Einstein field equations - it is
   the Schwarzschild geometry in Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates.
   This result is much stronger than the well-known result of Michell and
   Laplace whereby a Newtonian argument correctly estimates the value of
   the Schwarzschild radius - using the heuristic presented in this article
   one obtains the entire Schwarzschild geometry. The heuristic also gives
   sensible results - a Riemann flat geometry - when applied to a constant
   gravitational field. Furthermore, a subtle extension of the heuristic
   correctly reproduces the Reissner-Nordstrom geometry and even the de
   Sitter geometry. Unfortunately the heuristic construction is not truly
   generic. For instance, it is incapable of generating the Kerr geometry
   or anti-de Sitter space.
   Despite this limitation, the heuristic does have useful pedagogical
   value in that it provides a simple and direct plausibility argument (not
   a derivation) for the Schwarzschild geometry - suitable for classroom
   use in situations where the full power and technical machinery of
   general relativity might be inappropriate. The extended heuristic
   provides more challenging problems - suitable for use at the graduate
   level.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic delivery systems based on biodegradable coatings have found
   considerable interest for the prophylaxis and local therapy of
   biomaterial-related infections. In this study sparingly water-soluble
   gentamicin salts have been prepared and tested as biodegradable

   homogeneous, well adhering films can be produced on various implant
   materials, like ceramics, glasses or metals surfaces, with different
   surface morphologies. The in vitro release profiles of the antibiotic
   coating systems were characterized by an initial burst release followed
   by a sustained release of small antibiotic amounts up to several weeks.
   It was found that the in vitro release, especially in the initial phase,
   can be modulated by the ratio between highly water-soluble gentamicin
   salts and sparingly soluble ones in the coating. Coating systems of the
   same type as described for gentamicin are available from a wide range of
   antibiotics differing in structure and mechanism of antibacterial

   as the compression of the electronic wave function and show a similar
   size distribution of Si-nc as the porous Si-nc layer underneath, which

   performance. Students (N = 211) learned how a dynamic system works and
   how to reach given goal states for the system. One group received
   feedback (i.e., knowledge of performance) the other one did not. We
   expected learners to improve after they received the first feedback.
   However, we found that learners expecting feedback used better
   strategies right from the start. Thus, they acquired more knowledge over
   fewer trials. Although we had also expected effects of feedback on
   motivation during learning, we could not support this hypothesis. (c)

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous gene expression in tumours and the degradation of RNA when
   sampling under non-RNAsefree conditions may limit the potential benefit
   of cDNA array studies. This study examines changes in the integrity of
   RNA by means of RNA gel electrophoresis at various postoperative
   intervals on canine mammary tumours (n=10) and malignant lymphoma (n=1).
   The tumours were cut into pieces (3-5 mm diameter, approximately 50 mg)
   and kept in tubes without RNAse-free buffer at room temperature. No
   special precautions were taken to avoid the influences of RNAse; rather,
   normal surgical procedures were used. We found that total RNA of the
   mammary tumours started to degrade within 30 min of the operation, and
   the rate of degradation increased up to 4 h, which was the last time
   point included in this study. RNA in the lymphoma tumours degraded more
   rapidly, and was completely degraded at 30 min post-operation. The
   degradation of mRNA in the mammary tumours, as studied by human cDNA
   arrays, was heterogeneous, i.e. some mRNA degraded completely, some only
   partially. This indicates that the mRNA degradation rate varied
   depending on the type of mRNA. However, since we found that gene
   expression differs depending on the part of the mammary tumour examined,
   one cannot exclude that the variation in the mRNA degradation rate may
   simply reflect heterogeneous gene expression within the turnout. We
   conclude that RNA integrity is unaffected immediately after sampling
   under non-RNAse-free conditions; however, the tumour sample should be
   preserved under RNAse-free conditions within 15 min to avoid RNA
   degradation. This is a much shorter time interval than previously
   reported in other similar studies; however, these studies generally
   treated normal tissue, under which 3-5 h non-RNAse-free conditions have
   been found not to affect RNA quality.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the I
   Promise Program (IPP), a driving program developed for families with
   young new drivers (YNDs).
   Design, setting, and subjects: The IPP consists of a contract between
   parents and YNDs and a rear window decal (sticker). Program
   acceptability was assessed through four focus groups with 40 young new
   drivers (YND), two with 19 parents of YNDs, and two with 15 community
   members. To determine whether the program's design, materials, and
   procedures were working as planned, 51 families participated in a six
   month pilot project. Telephone and in-person interviews were conducted
   at months 1 and 6, respectively.
   Results: Participants had problems with the acceptability of the
   program's underlying message; content, format, and language of the
   materials; program cost; and proposed participant incentives. Thirty
   eight (75\%) families completed the six month pilot. Most YNDs (75\%)
   and parents (85\%) identified the contract as a useful communication
   tool. Despite positive initial reactions, 50\% of YNDs did not recall
   the content of the contract after six months. Sixty eight percent of
   families had problems with the decal (for example, did not stay affixed,
   colors faded) and only 17\% of YNDs reported a lasting impact on their
   driving. Only 20\% of families chose to continue in the program after
   the pilot.
   Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of formative and
   process evaluation in the development of a new prevention strategy to
   assess a strategy's acceptability and feasibility. In response to
   participants' feedback, revisions made to the program's materials and
   delivery model included making its two key components-the contract and
   decal-available online, independent of each other, and free of charge.}},

   stimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD) on stance and gait
   ({''}axial{''} motor control), and related this to effects on finger
   movements ({''}appendicular{''} motor control). Fourteen PD patients and
   20 matched controls participated. Subjects completed several balance and
   gait tasks (standing with eyes open or closed, on a normal or foam
   surface; retropulsion test; walking with eyes closed; walking up and
   down stairs; Get Up and Go test). Postural control was quantified using
   trunk sway measurements (angle and angular velocity) in the roll and
   pitch directions. Subjects further performed a pinch grip reaction time
   task, where we measured isometric grip forces, as well as movement and
   reaction times. Patients were examined with STN stimulators switched on
   or off (order randomised across patients), always after a supramaximal
   levodopa dosage. STN stimulation improved postural control, as reflected
   by a reduced trunk sway tremor during stance, a reduced duration for all
   gait tasks, an increased trunk pitch velocity while rising from a chair,
   and improved roll stability. STN stimulation also improved finger
   control, as reflected by a reduced time to reach maximum grip force,
   without altering reaction times and maximum force levels. Improvements
   in finger control timing did not correlate with reduced task durations
   during gait. We conclude that STN stimulation affords improvement of
   postural control in PD, over and above optimal drug treatment. STN
   stimulation also provides a simultaneous effect on distal and axial
   motor control. Because improvements in distal and axial motor control
   were not correlated, we assume that these effects are mediated by
   stimulation of different structures within the STN.}},

   begins before birth but then continues into adulthood. Consequently,
   many newborn granule cells must integrate into a preexisting hippocampal
   network. Little is known about the timing of this process or the
   characteristics of the first established synapses. We used mice that
   transiently express enhanced green fluorescent protein in newborn
   granule cells to examine their synaptic input. Although newborn granule
   cells had functional glutamate receptors, evoked and spontaneous
   synaptic currents were exclusively GABAergic with immature
   characteristics including slow rise and decay phases and depolarized
   reversal potentials. Synaptic currents in newborn granule cells were
   relatively insensitive to the GABA A receptor modulator zolpidem
   compared with neighboring mature granule cells. Consistent with the
   kinetics and pharmacology, newborn granule cells isolated by fluorescent
   cell sorting lacked the alpha(1) GABA A receptor subunit. Our results
   indicate that newborn granule cells initially receive only GABAergic
   synapses even in the adult.}},

Abstract = {{We report new geologic and geomorphic observations that bear on the
   interpretation of connectivity and strain transfer among the Panamint
   Valley, Searles Valley, and Ash Hill fault zones, southern Walker Lane
   belt of California. Although these faults partition strain regionally
   onto dominantly normal and strike-slip structures, strain transfer
   occurs in a complex way not typical of linked strike-slip and
   extensional faults. The Searles Valley fault (W-directed normal fault)
   transfers slip onto the Panamint Valley zone, which changes from
   dominantly NNW-trending dextral strike-slip to more normal motion where
   they join. The Ash Hill fault (mostly right-lateral strike slip)
   transfers strain into the northern continuation of the Searles Valley
   zone, via a complex array of hanging-wall normal and strike-slip faults.
   These complex interactions, based on the age of structurally offset
   markers, appear to be stable over; 105 years.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of chemomechanical
   preparation of the root canals with sodium hypochlorite and
   interappointment medication with calcium hydroxide in the control of
   root canal infection and healing of periapical lesions. Fifty teeth
   diagnosed with chronic apical periodontitis were randomly allocated to
   one of three treatments: Single visit (SV group, n = 20), calcium
   hydroxide for one week (CH group n = 18), or leaving the canal empty but
   sealed for one week (EC group, n = 12). Microbiological samples were
   taken to monitor the infection during treatment. Periapical healing was
   controlled radiographically following the change in the periapical index
   at 52 wk and analyzed using one-way ANOVA. All cases showed
   microbiological growth in the beginning of the treatment. After
   mechanical preparation and irrigation with sodium hypochlorite in the
   first appointment, 20 to 33\% of the cases showed growth. At the second
   appointment 33\% of the cases in the CH group revealed bacteria, whereas
   the EC group showed remarkably more culture positive cases (67\%).
   Sodium hypochlorite was effective also at the second appointment and
   only two teeth remained culture positive. Only minor differences in
   periapical healing were observed between the treatment groups. However,
   bacterial growth at the second appointment had a significant negative
   impact on healing of the periapical lesion (p < 0.01). The present study
   indicates good clinical efficacy of sodium hypochlorite irrigation in
   the control of root canal infection. Calcium hydroxide dressing between
   the appointments did not show the expected effect in disinfection the
   root canal system and treatment outcome, indicating the need to develop
   more efficient interappointment dressings.}},

Title = {{Using mobile technologies to give health students access to learning
   resources in the UK community setting}},
Journal = {{HEALTH INFORMATION AND LIBRARIES JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{51-65}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: This article describes a project which explored the
   potential for mobile technologies to give health students in the
   community access to learning resources. The purpose included the need to
   identify possible barriers students could face in using mobile
   technologies. Another focus was to assess the students perceptions of
   the importance of being able to access learning resources in the
   community.
   Methods: This 1-year project used two main approaches for data
   collection. A review of the literature on mobile technologies in the
   health context was conducted. This was used in a systematic way to
   identify key issues and trends. The literature review was used to inform
   the design and production of a questionnaire. This was distributed to
   and completed by a group of community health students at Northumbria
   University, UK. The questionnaire was piloted and there was a 100\%
   completion rate with 49 returned forms.
   Results: The literature review indicated that most mobile technology
   applications were occurring in the US. At the time of the review the
   most prevalent mobile technologies were PDAs, laptops, WAP phones and
   portable radios with use being concentrated around doctors in the acute
   sector. A range of advantages and disadvantages to the technology were
   discovered. Mobile technologies were mainly being used for clinical
   rather than learning applications. The students showed a low level of
   awareness of the technology but placed great importance to accessing
   learning resources from the community.
   Conclusions: Significant development and changes are taking place in
   mobile technologies. Since the data collection for this work was
   completed in 2004 podcasting and videocasting have become significant in
   mobile learning for health professionals. Librarians will need to
   address the relevance and implications of m-learning for their practice.
   Care and consideration needs to be given on the time and resources
   librarians allocate for the necessary development work around mobile
   technologies. Collaboration and partnership working will be most
   effective approach for librarians wishing to integrate their services
   with m-learning technologies.}},

Abstract = {{We make a systematic study of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in a

   the laser intensity can be divided into three regimes in which HHG
   spectra exhibit different characteristics. The pulse-duration dependence
   of the HHG spectra in these regimes is studied. We also demonstrate
   evident advantages of using coherent superposition state to obtain high
   conversion efficiency. The conversion efficiency can be increased
   further if ultrashort laser pulses are employed.}},

Abstract = {{Liver transplantation, a definitive treatment for end-stage liver
   disease, has achieved excellent results. However, potential recipients
   on the waiting list outnumber donors. To expand the donor pool, marginal
   grafts from older donors, steatotic livers, and non-heart-beating liver
   donors (NHBD) have been used for transplantation. Reducing the warm
   ischemia time of NHBD is the critical factor in organs preservation.
   Liver transplantation using grafts from NHBD have been reported to
   display a high incidence of primary graft nonfunction and biliary
   complications. The authors report a liver graft donor who was maintained
   on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after successful
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Core body temperature was 5 degrees C.
   Procurement of the liver using a rapid flush technique was performed 4
   hours after instituting ECMO. Graft function recovered fully after
   transplantation. In conclusion, ECMO may be used to reduce warm ischemia
   time in liver grafts obtained from uncontrolled NHBD, thereby increasing
   graft salvage rates.}},

   (S)-valine methyl ester to form a chiral imine, which was reacted with

   the corresponding chiral homoallylic amine with high optical activity.
   After removing Boc group, the newly formed chiral homoallylic amine was
   condensed with 2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde to provide a novel chiral imine
   with high optical purity. The following asymmetric addition of allyl

   determination of the equivalent refractive index n, equivalent

Abstract = {{A low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) Patterson function (PF) with
   multiple incident angles is used to determine the structure of the
   indium-induced Si(111)-4x1-In reconstructed surface. The experimental PF
   maps were compared with ones calculated by both single scattering and
   the tensor-LEED method according to various theoretical models so that
   one can pick out the right one. It was found that the model proposed by
   Bunk is the best appropriate one, from which the induced PF maps are
   similar to the experimental ones. Further analysis of the PF spots
   obtained from the experimental PF maps directly generates the same model
   without any presupposition. It indicates that the multiple-incidence
   Patterson function is an effective method to determine the surface
   structure. Moreover, detailed atomic positions on surface were deduced
   from first-principles calculations and tensor-LEED I-V curve
   simulations. We also compared the results with those of previous
   investigations. Good agreement was found between them.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and electrochemical properties of the
   La0.7Mg0.3Ni3.4-xMn0.1 Co-x (x=0 - 1.05) hydrogen storage alloys were
   investigated. The crystal structure and the lattice parameters of the

   Electrochemical properties of the alloys including p-c-t curves,
   discharge capacity, discharge capacity retention were studied. The
   results show that (La, Mg) Ni-3 and LaNi5 are the main phases of all the
   alloys. The plateau pressure for hydrogen absorption/desorption
   decreases and the hydrogen storage capacity firstly increases and
   subsequently decreases with increasing Cc content. The values of the
   maximum discharge capacity of the alloy electrodes remain in range of
   395.3 - 403.1 mA(.)h/g in spite of the change of Cc content. The cycling
   stability of the alloy electrodes is greatly improved with increasing Co
   content, which is attributed to the suppression of the cell volume
   expansion during hydriding, leading the pulverization of the alloy
   particles lowered and the oxidation/corrosion of the active elements
   reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon nanocone arrays are formed on porous silicon substrates by
   plasma etching in a hot filament chemical vapour deposition system. The
   as-formed Si nanocones were characterized by means of scanning electron

   that the nanocone is composed of a silicon core coated with a thin
   amorphous carbon (a-C) layer produced by carbon-bearing plasma etching.
   Plasma etching is a key factor in the formation of the nanocone arrays,
   while re-condensation of evaporated silicon atoms on the tip of the
   as-etched cone also occurs. Field emission measurements show that the
   a-C coating can effectively enhance the field emission ability of the
   nanocone arrays due to the decrease of the surface work function from

   were considered as the candidate genes that have the effect on porcine
   production and immune traits in this study. Genetic variations of these
   three genes were investigated and the single nucleotide
   polymorphism-based (SNPs-based) association analyses were studied
   initially. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) revealed that there is a MvaI polymorphic site
   in intron3 of PSMC3 gene and a Mbol polymorphic site within intron 5 of
   PSMC6 gene, as well as a RsaI polymorphic site within exon 10 of the
   PSMD3 gene. chi(2) analysis presented that allele frequencies differed
   among four breeds (Meishan, Erhualian, Qingping pig and Duroc) at PSMC3
   and PSMD3 loci (P < 0.01). Association analysis showed that the PSMC3
   gene has an effect on average backfat thickness (P < 0.01), total
   erythrocytes (P < 0.01) and hematocrit (P < 0.01), and there is a
   significant association between the PSMD3 genotypes and the mean

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To study the heritability of preterm delivery.
   METHODS: Women who delivered a singleton infant at less than 36 weeks of
   gestation were asked about their family history. Twenty-eight families
   were identified in which the proband had at least five first- or
   second-degree relatives with preterm delivery. An extensive genealogy
   database (GenDB) was constructed using more than 9,000 genealogy sources
   in the public domain (records before 1929). GenDB documents the
   relationships between more than 17.5 million ancestors and 3.5 million
   descendants of approximately 10,000 individuals who moved to Utah in the
   mid 1800s. This database was searched for the names, birth dates, and
   birthplaces of the four grandparents for each of the 28 probands.
   Pairwise coefficients of kinship were determined for the 93 preterm
   delivery grandparents identified, and for sets of 100 individuals born
   in the 1920s who were randomly selected from the population database.
   RESULTS: Probands had a mean of 3.3 grandparents included in this
   database. The average coefficient of kinship for controls was 1.5 x
   10(6) (standard deviation = 0.6 x 10(6)). This measure agrees with
   previous calculations for the Utah population. The coefficient of
   kinship for familial preterm delivery grandparents was more than 50
   standard deviations higher (3.4 x 10(5) {[}P < .001]).
   CONCLUSION: This study confirms the familial nature of preterm delivery.
   On average, gravidae randomly selected from our population are 23rd
   degree relatives, while these preterm delivery probands are
   eighth-degree relatives. A genome-wide scan using these affected
   families is underway.}},

   were EUS trained during GI fellowship, and 19\% learned via other means.
   EUS performers were subgrouped into those who had and had not completed
   advanced encloscopy fellowship, and those within and outside of an
   academic practice. There were significant associations between the
   number of upper EUS, pancreaticobiliary, and EUS-guided FNAs performed
   during training (p < 0.001 for all 3 groups) and completion of advanced
   endoscopy fellowship. Physicians in academic practice performed more EUS
   and FNAs per month than physicians in other types of practice (p values
   < 0.001 and 0.001, respectively); 93.3\% of respondents felt they
   received adequate instruction in diagnostic EUS, regardless of type of
   training; 88.9\% of EUS performers felt they received adequate
   instruction in performing FNA.
   Conclusions: Most EUS performers are in academic practice. Those with
   advanced training obtained higher training volumes and perform higher
   volumes of EUS. The majority of respondents felt well trained regardless
   of training type and the number of procedures performed during training.
   This is the first analysis to assess these aspects of EUS training and
   practice.}},

   this case suggests that the pathways from the frontal eye field descend
   at least to the level of the mid-pontine region ipsilaterally, and that
   the pathways then contralaterally decussate and terminate in the
   paramedian pontine reticular formation. Cerebral microbleeds can be

Title = {{Relationship between changes in BMD and nonvertebral fracture incidence
   associated with risedronate: Reduction in risk of nonvertebral fracture
   is not related to change in BMD}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: In untreated patients, low BMD correlates with increased
   fracture risk. Whether greater increases in BMD induced by
   anti-osteoporosis drugs are related to greater decreases in vertebral
   fracture risk is controversial, and little has been written about the
   relationship between change in BMD and nonvertebral fracture risk. We
   analyzed the relationship between BMD change and nonvertebral fracture
   incidence using individual patient data from postmenopausal osteoporotic
   women receiving antiresorptive treatment with risedronate.
   Materials and Methods: This posthoc analysis combined data from three
   pivotal risedronate fracture endpoint trials. Women received risedronate
   2.5 or 5 mg (n = 2561) or placebo (n = 1418) daily for up to 3 years.
   BMD and nonvertebral fractures confirmed by radiograph (hip, wrist,
   pelvis, humerus, clavicle, and leg) were assessed periodically over 3
   years.
   Results: The incidence of nonvertebral fractures in risedronate-treated
   patients was not different between patients whose spine BMD decreased
   (7.8\%) and those whose spine BMD increased (6.4\%; hazard ratio to
   subgroup of patients who lost BMD {[}HR], 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.50, 1.25) or
   between those whose femoral neck BMD decreased (7.6\%) and those whose
   femoral neck BMD increased (7.5\%; HR, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.68, 1.28). The
   changes in lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD explained only 12\% (95\%
   CI, 2\%, 21 \%; p = 0.014) and 7\% (95\% CI, 2\%, 13\%; p = 0.005),
   respectively, of risedronate's nonvertebral fracture efficacy.
   Conclusions: For patients treated with risedronate, changes in BMD as
   measured by DXA do not predict the degree of reduction in nonvertebral
   fractures.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines healthcare utilization over time in Bronx, New York
   schoolchildren with asthma who were previously identified via parent
   surveys in six elementary schools. Four of the schools have on-site
   school-based health centers (SBHCs), and two do not have on-site health
   services (control schools). At baseline, we reported an asthma
   prevalence of 20\%, and high rates of emergency department (ED) use
   (46\%) in the previous year To determine if asthma morbidity
   (specifically, ED use, community provider use, and hospitalizations for
   asthma) could be reduced by incorporating an aggressive intervention at
   two schools with SBHCs, we prospectively followed children for up to 3
   years. Parents were scheduled for interviews every 6 months, and were
   queried about their children's use of health services for asthma in the
   prior 6 months. In multivariate models, children in the two intervention
   SBHC schools were less likely to have visited a community provider for
   asthma (relative rate ratio, 0.52; 95\% confidence interval (CI),
   0.30-0.88) or an emergency department for asthma (odds ratio, 0.44; 95\%
   CI, 0.14-1.38; P = 0.059) in the prior 6 months compared to children
   attending control schools. There was no difference in community provider
   use or emergency department use for asthma between children attending
   nonintervention SBHCs and control schools. However, school type did not
   affect asthma hospitalization rates, which declined in all groups. Our
   findings support the effectiveness of aggressive school-based asthma
   services provided by SBHCs to reduce asthma morbidity and complement
   community health services.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine submaximal isometric force
   production guided by perceptual feelings of exertion. Thirty young
   adults performed isometric knee extensions on an isokinetic dynamometer.
   Subjects performed five different tests; the first test was the same for
   all subjects (standard naive test). During the standard naive test,
   subjects were asked to randomly produce force at perceived contraction
   intensities (25\%, 50\% and 75\% of their maximum voluntary contraction
   (MVC)), with 100\% MVC performed as the final intensity. All
   intensities, including the 100\% MVC, were randomly performed in the
   other four tests (control tests 1 and 2, post 20\% MVC and post 100\%
   MVC tests). Post 20\% MVC and post 100\% MVC tests included fatiguing
   isometric exercise at 20\% and 100\% MVC respectively, which were
   performed prior to the test protocol. Results show that absolute peak
   force increased with increasing intensity (P < 0.001) during all tests.
   During the standard naive test, absolute peak force at 25\% and 50\% MVC
   was significantly lower (P=0.009) compared to control test 2, post 20\%
   MVC and 100\% MVC tests, and relative peak force was lower at all
   intensities compared to all other tests (P < 0.001). Absolute and
   relative peak force was most accurate at 50\% MVC (-12.06 N and -2.42\%,
   respectively). Prior fatiguing isometric exercise did not affect the
   subsequent perceptual response range. In conclusion, isometric force was
   most accurate at 25\% MVC but under-produced (perceptually
   overestimated) during higher contraction intensities preceding a maximal
   voluntary contraction (100\% MVC). The ability to match absolute force
   with target contraction intensities was most accurate at 50\% MVC during
   all five experimental conditions and poor at opposite ends of the force
   domain. Furthermore, prior fatiguing isometric exercise did not have an
   effect on the subsequent perceptual response range.}},

Abstract = {{The paper provides empirical results on potential impacts from customer
   perceived quality and customer satisfaction on various financial
   indicators for the Swedish real estate market. Quality data are taken
   from the Swedish Real Estate Barometer, and financial data from the SFI/
   IPD Swedish Property Index. Results provide some support for the
   hypothesis that investments to improve customer satisfaction are first
   cost driving, but will, towards the latter part of the time period
   examined ( 1997 - 2002), significantly and positively impact
   profitability. The main driver for this seems to be reputation and
   positive word- of- mouth due to improved customer satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{The coupling of photons and baryons by Thomson scattering in the early
   universe imprints features in both the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
   and matter power spectra. The former have been used to constrain a host
   of cosmological parameters, the latter have the potential to strongly
   constrain the expansion history of the universe and dark energy. Key to
   this program is the means to localize the primordial features in
   observations of galaxy spectra which necessarily involve galaxy bias,
   non-linear evolution and redshift space distortions. We present
   calculations, based oil mock catalogues produced from particle-mesh
   simulations, which show the range of behaviors we might expect of
   galaxies in the real universe. We find that non-linearity, galaxy bias
   and redshift space distortions all introduce important modifications to
   the basic picture. Both the galaxy bias and the (isotropic) redshift
   space distortions lead to relatively smooth modulations in power on the
   scales of interest to baryon oscillations. The halo and galaxy power
   spectra exhibit low order structure beyond the acoustic oscillations
   over the range of scales of relevance. Fitting a cubic polynomial to the
   ratio of galaxy to dark matter power reduces any remaining structure in
   the range 0.03 <= k <= 0.3 h Mpc(-1) below the 2\% level, which is close
   to the error in our calculations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   scarce. Here the concept of `social support' is used to analyse
   interviews with 34 first-year students, investigating the processes
   through which social integration (or lack of it) influenced their
   decision as to whether or not to leave university. Our data support the
   claim that making compatible friends is essential to retention, and that
   students' living arrangements are central to this process. Such friends
   provide direct emotional support, equivalent to family relationships, as
   well as buffering support in stressful situations. Course friendships
   and relationships with personal tutors are important but less

Abstract = {{The safety of biological control is a contentious issue. We suggest that
   constructing and analyzing food webs may be a valuable addition to
   standard biological control research techniques, as they offer a means
   of assessing the post-release safety of control agents. Using
   preliminary data to demonstrate the value of food webs in biocontrol
   programs, we quantified the extent to which a key agent has infiltrated
   natural communities in Australia and, potentially, impacted on
   non-target species. Using these data, we also demonstrate how food webs
   can be used to generate testable hypotheses regarding indirect
   interactions between introduced agents and non-target species. We
   developed food webs in communities invaded to varying degrees by an
   exotic weed, bitou bush, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata, and
   a key biocontrol agent for this weed in Australia, the tephritid fly,
   Mesoclanis polana. Three food webs were constructed during springtime
   showing the interactions between plants, seed-feeding insects and their
   parasitoids. One food web was constructed in a plot of native Australian
   vegetation that was free of bitou bush ('bitou-free'), another in a plot
   of Australian vegetation surrounded by an invasion of bitou bush
   ('bitou-threatened') and a third from a plot infested with a monoculture
   of bitou bush ('bitou-infested'). The bitou-free web contained 36
   species, the bitou-threatened plot 9 species and the bitou-infested web
   contained 6 species. One native Australian herbivore attacked the seeds
   of bitou bush. M. polana, a seed-feeding fly, was heavily attacked by
   native parasitoids, these being more abundant than the parasitoids
   feeding on the native seed feeders. A surprising result is that none of
   the three species of native parasitoids reared from M. polana were
   reared from any of the native herbivores. The food webs revealed how a
   highly host-specific biocontrol agent, such as M. polana has the
   potential to change community structure by increasing the abundance of
   native parasitoids. The webs also suggest that indirect interactions
   between M. polana and native non-target species are possible, these been
   mediated by shared parasitoids. The experiments necessary to determine
   the presence of these interactions are outlined. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Species-area relationships and island biogeography theory are commonly
   used to predict how species richness will decline with fragmentation.
   There arc, a variety of largely untested assumptions in these
   approaches, including the assumptions that populations are distributed
   uniformly before fragmentation, and that local extinctions are due to
   effects of small population sizes. If populations arc, not distributed
   uniformly, then populations can be abundant locally but rare globally
   This would cause extinction rates to be smaller than predicted. We
   tested extinction theory by developing estimates of the number of plant
   species that should be present in small tallgrass prairie fragments and
   then testing the uniformity assumption by partitioning species richness
   into alpha (within site) and beta (among site) components in Iowa
   prairies. Many more native prairie plant species were present in surveys
   of prairie fragments (491) than was predicted based on theory (27-207).
   A large proportion (75\%) of the total species richness was beta
   richness. We suggest that the high proportion of richness wets
   responsible for the shallow species-area slopes and The lower than
   expected number of species losses and that a better understanding of
   what determines beta diversity will. improve predictions of
   fragmentation effects on richness of plants. We also suggest that plants
   in prairie remnants may be best conserved by protecting different
   prairie types rather than by protecting a few large areas containing a
   single prairie type.}},

   of Latino migration, arguing for more attention to its interactions with
   racial formations and practices in southern communities and the
   geographic and place contingency of its features across the region. To
   achieve more critical understandings of these processes, it suggests,
   future studies must contextualize this migration in relation to studies
   of both immigrant gateway cities across the USA and the historical

Abstract = {{When the temperature of an elastomer exceeds a critical value, there can
   be scission and re-crosslinking of molecular chains and the formation of
   new molecular networks. These events are time and temperature dependent.
   When this happens in a deforming elastomer, there can be permanent set
   and modified mechanical properties. A constitutive theory has recently
   been proposed that accounts for these continuous changes in
   microstructure. Several analytical results are presented in this paper
   for materials that are described by this theory. First, several motions
   and associated temperature distributions are presented that are possible
   in every material described by the constitutive theory, independent of
   material properties. Second, when the temperature of an elastomer
   increases beyond the critical value and then decreases below it,
   scission and re-crosslinking stops and the resulting material exhibits
   modified elastic response. The constitutive equation for the modified
   elastic response is developed from the underlying constitutive theory,
   and the associated material anisotropy is discussed. Lastly, special
   results are obtained when the original and newly formed networks can be
   described as neo-Hookean.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the breeding biology of the Le Conte's Sparrow
   (Ammodranuis leconteh), probably because of its secretive nature. We
   provide new information on several aspects of Le Conte's Sparrow
   breeding biology, including rates of nest parasitism by Brown-headed
   Cowbirds (Molothrusater) and potential factors affecting breeding
   densities and nesting success of the species. Our study was conducted in
   the tallgrass prairie of northwestern Minnesota and southeastern North
   Dakota during 1998-2002. Breeding densities varied among years, but this
   variation was not clearly linked to climatic patterns. Vegetation had
   some influence on densities of Le Conte's Sparrows; densities were
   highest in grasslands with moderate amounts of bare ground. Prairie
   patch size and the percentage of shrubs and trees in the landscape had
   no recognizable influence on density. Nesting Success was highly
   variable among sites and years and increased slightly with distance from
   trees. Rates of nest parasitism were low (1 of 50 nests parasitized),
   and clutch sizes were similar to those of other studies of Le Conte's
   Sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with
   multiple extrahepatic manifestations. It is unclear to what extent
   extrahepatic manifestations occur in HIV/HCV coinfection. Methods: We
   prospectively assessed cross-sectional frequencies of autoimmune
   manifestations in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (n=98), HIV-mono-infected
   (n=45) and HCV-mono-infected patients (n=78). Diagnostic vasculitis
   scores, HCV and HIV loads, CD4 cell counts, thyroid-, cardiolipin-,
   non-organ-specific tissue antibodies (nuclear, smooth muscle,
   anti-liver-kidney-microsome, neutrophil-cytoplasmic) and cryoglobulins
   were determined. Results: Synergistic effects of HCV and HIV infection
   were observed with respect to the prevalence of antibodies against
   thyroglobulin (HCV infection 15.4\%, HIV infection 8.8\%, HIV/HCV
   coinfection 30.6\%; P < 0.001) and cardiolipin antibodies (HCV infection
   9.0\%, HIV infection 31\%, HIV/HCV coinfection 46\%; P < 0.001).
   Cryoglobulinemia type III, was significantly associated with HCV
   infection (HCV, 25.6\%; HIV/HCV, 20.4\%) but not with HIV infection
   (4.4\%, P < 0.05). Rheumatoid factor was commonly detected in patients
   with HCV infection (48\%), but occurred considerably less frequently in
   patients with HIV infection (4.4\%) or HIV/HCV coinfection (9.5\%, P <
   0.01). Conclusion: HIV coinfection appears to differentially modulate
   the frequency of HCV-related autoimmunity. However, autoimmunity is
   rarely accompanied by clinical manifestations.}},

Abstract = {{In many fields of science there are multivariate observations that may
   be assumed to be generated by a (physical) linear mixing process of
   contributions from different sources. If the compositions of the sources
   are constant for different observations, then these observations are, up
   to a random error term, nonnegative linear combinations of a fixed set
   of so-called ``source profiles{''} that characterize the sources. The
   goal of linear unmixing is to recover both the source profiles and the
   source activities (also called scores) from a multivariate dataset. We
   present a new parametric mixing model that assumes a multivariate
   lognormal distribution for the scores. This model is proved to be
   identifiable. Moreover, consistency and asymptotic normality of the
   maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) are established in special cases. To
   calculate the MLE, we propose the combination of two variants of the
   Monte Carlo EM algorithm. The proposed model is applied to simulated
   datasets and to a set of air pollution measurements. In addition to the
   basic model, several extensions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Neuropepticle Y (NPY) prominently inhibits epileptic seizures in
   different animal models. The NPY receptors mediating this effect remain
   controversial partially due to lack of highly selective agonists and
   antagonists. To circumvent this problem, we used various NPY receptor
   knockout mice with the same genetic background and explored
   anti-epileptic action of NPY in vitro and in vivo. In Y2 (Y2-/-) and Y5
   (Y5-/-) receptor knockouts, NPY partially inhibited 0 Mg2(+)-induced
   epileptiform activity in hippocampal slices. In contrast, in double
   knockouts (Y2Y5-/-), NPY had no effect, suggesting that in the
   hippocampus in vitro both receptors mediate anti-epileptiform action of
   NPY in an additive manner. Systemic kainate induced more severe seizures
   in Y5-/- and Y2Y5-/-, but not in Y2-/- mice, as compared to wild-type
   mice. Moreover, kainate seizures were aggravated by administration of
   the Y5 antagonist L-152,804 in wild-type mice. In Y5-/- mice,
   hippocampal kindling progressed faster, and afterdischarge durations
   were longer in amygdala, but not in hippocampus, as compared to
   wild-type controls. Taken together, these data suggest that, in mice,
   both Y2 and Y5 receptors regulate hippocampa seizures in vitro, while
   activation of Y5 receptors in extra-hippocampa: regions reduces
   generalized seizures in vivo. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   depression in the far-red and near-infrared part of the spectrum,

   object COMBO-17 J114356.08-0144032 has very similar colours to LHS 3250,
   which was the first of its kind to be recognized. However, at R = 21. 5
   it is the faintest and possibly most distant such object discovered to
   date. It is the only such object in COMBO-17 at R < 23; due to the small
   sky coverage of 0.78 square degrees. this chance discovery can not
   provide any constraints on the abundance of faint ultra-cool white

Abstract = {{There are few studies of osteoporosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). We

   measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning. Further data,
   including demography, disease duration, and disease severity, were
   collected. One hundred five subjects participated; median age was 75
   (54-92) years. Fifty-one (49\%) patients were men. Of the men: median T
   score, -1.3 (range, -4.7 to 3.8); median Z score, 0.0 (-3.2 to 4.7);
   diagnostic categories: osteoporosis, 20\%; osteopenia, 41\%; normal,

   osteopenia, 34\%; and normal, 24\%. There were associations between age,
   depression, disease duration, and osteoporosis but not with disease
   severity. Female gender was an independent predictor of osteoporosis.
   The prevalence of osteoporosis/osteopenia is considerable in PD patients
   but does not exceed that of other people of similar age.

Abstract = {{T-helper (Th) 2 cells, which produce the cytokines interleukins (IL)-4,
   IL-5 and IL-13, dominate T cell responses in allergic diseases. The
   Th1-type cytokines IL-12 and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) are important
   in down-regulating Th2 responses to allergens. Patients with defects in
   the IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) or IFN gamma receptor (IFN gamma R) have
   abnormal responses to IL-12 or IFN gamma and a failure to produce normal
   levels of IFN gamma. Current paradigms of T-helper subset balance would
   predict a high prevalence of atopic illness in this group. We have
   studied a cohort of patients (n = 29) with defects in these pathways to
   assess the prevalence of allergic disease. A questionnaire based on
   those developed for the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in
   Childhood (ISAAC) was used in conjunction with analysis of total and
   specific IgE to common aeroallergens. The prevalence of asthma, eczema
   and rhinoconjunctivitis (13.7\%, 17.5\% and 6.8\% respectively) in this
   group was no higher than in comparable populations where prevalences of
   13.9\%, 7.9\% and 13.5\% are reported for asthma, eczema and
   rhinoconjunctivitis respectively. Patients with IFN gamma R defects had
   higher rates of clinical atopic illness than control populations and
   patients with IL-12R defects, with 28.5\% prevalences for asthma and
   eczema, respectively. None of the patients suffered from severe clinical
   atopic disease. Defects in interferon- gamma receptor/interleukin-12
   receptor responses are not sufficient to cause clinical allergic
   disease. Patients with defects in the interferon-gamma receptor pathway
   have a higher prevalence of high IgE and clinical atopic illness
   compared to control populations, supporting the concept that
   interferon-gamma receptor signalling plays a role in down-regulating
   type-2 cytokine responses.}},

Abstract = {{The principal objective of this study was determination of the response
   of a laboratory-scale vapor-phase flow-direction-switching biofilter to
   loading changes associated with normal operations such as lunch breaks,
   overnight shutdowns, and single-shift operation of commercial and
   industrial facilities. Three regular transient loading cases were
   considered: (a) variable flow-reversal interval lenghts, (b) variable
   feed-on/off interval lengths, and (c) variable inlet concentration
   during a repeating feed-on/off cycle. Toluene was used as the model
   contaminant compound. The most significant findings of the study were:
   (1) Relative to unidirectional mode of operation, periodic flow reversal
   produced a more uniform distribution of reaction capacity along the
   length of the packed bed; (2) a 12 h flow reversal interval was
   sufficiently short to maintain the toluene-degrading microbial community
   in a near-fully active state throughout the unit whereas a 2 day flow
   reversal interval resulted in diminished removal rates in the first half
   of the bed and (3) Increasing off-period length resulted in greater
   penetration of contaminant into the bed and more uniform removal rates
   along the length of the bed. Information developed in this study should
   provide a more complete basis for establishing operating protocols and
   monitoring regulations for vapor-phase biofiltration systems.}},

Abstract = {{Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) ORF2
   contains an internal ORF that codes for a small non-glycosylated protein
   known as 2b. Previous work had identified the presence of a 10 kDa 2b
   protein in virus-infected cells and the induction of an anti-2b response
   in PRRSV-infected pigs, as well as a possible association of 2b with the
   virion (Wu et al., 2001, Virology 287:183-191). In this study, we
   utilized two experimental approaches, including the use of a 2b
   peptide-specific monoclonal antibody, to demonstrate that the PRRSV 2b
   protein is an integral component of the PRRSV virion. This Study
   suggests that 2b in PRRSV is similar to the E protein in EAV and forms a
   minor structural component of the virion. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Discriminative training and explicit duration modeling for HMM-based
   automatic segmentation}},

Abstract = {{HMM-based automatic segmentation has been popularly used for corpus
   construction for concatenative speech synthesis. Since the most
   important reasons for the inaccuracy of HMM-based automatic segmentation
   are the HMM training criterion and duration control, we will study these
   particular issues. For the HMM training, we apply the discriminative
   training method. and introduce a new criterion, named Minimum
   SeGmentation Error (MSGE). In this method, a loss function directly
   related to the segmentation error is defined, and parameter optimization
   is performed by the Generalized Probabilistic Descent (GPD) algorithm.
   For the duration control problem, we apply explicit duration models and
   propose a two-step-based segmentation method to solve the problem of
   computational cost, where the duration model is incorporated in a
   postprocessor procedure. From the experimental results, these two
   techniques significantly improve segmentation accuracy with different
   focuses, where the MSGE-based discriminative training focuses on
   improving the accuracy of sensitive boundary, i.e., a boundary where an
   error in segmentation is likely to cause a noticeable degradation in
   speech synthesis quality, and the explicit duration modeling focuses on
   eliminating large errors. After combining these two techniques, the
   error average was reduced from 6.86 ms to 5.79 ms on Japanese data, and
   from 8.67 ms to 6.61 ms on Chinese data. Simultaneously, the number of
   errors larger than 30 ms were reduced 25\% and 51\% on Chinese and
   Japanese data, respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report here the in vitro characterization of
   1-(2chlorophenyl)-6-{[}(2R)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-methylpropyl]-1,5dihydro-4
   H-pyrazolo{[}3,4-d]pyrimidine-4-one (BAY 73-6691), the first potent and
   selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 9 (PDE9), which is currently
   under preclinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
   This compound selectively inhibits human (IC50 = 55 nM) and murine (IC50
   = 100 nM) PDE9 activity in vitro and shows only moderate activity
   against other cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterases. We also
   report the generation and characterization of a stably transfected PDE9
   Chinese hamster ovary cell line, additionally expressing soluble
   guanylate cyclase (sGC), the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated cation
   channel CNGA2 and the photoprotein aequorin. In this cell line,
   intracellular cGMP levels can be monitored in real-time via aequorin
   luminescence induced by Ca2+ influx through CNGA2, acting as the
   intracellular cGMP sensor. This simple and sensitive assay system was
   used for the characterization of the cellular activity of the new PDE9
   inhibitor. BAY 73-6691 alone did not significantly increase basal cGMP
   levels in this experimental setting. However, in combination with
   submaximal stimulating concentrations of the sGC activator
   4-{[}((4-carboxybutyl)\{2-{[}(4-phenethylbenzyl)oxy] phenethyl\} amino)
   methyl] benzoic acid ( BAY 582667), the compound induced
   concentration-dependent luminescence signals and intracellular cGMP
   accumulation. The PDE9 inhibitor significantly potentiated the cGMP
   signals generated by sGC activating compounds such as BAY 58-2667 or
   5-cyclopropyl-2-{[}1-(2-fluorobenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo{[}3,4-b]pyridin3-yl]py
   rimidin-4-ylamine (BAY 41-2272) and induced leftward shifts of the
   corresponding concentration-response curves. Using our newly generated
   PDE9 reporter cell line, we could show that BAY 73-6691 is able to
   efficiently penetrate cells and to inhibit intracellular PDE9 activity.}},

Abstract = {{We present an alternative approach based on a diagrammatic technique to
   the recently proposed variational coupled-cluster method. We apply this
   method to quantum antiferromagnetic bipartite lattices. In our analysis,
   infinite resummations of diagrams can be done in a straightforward
   manner. One such resummation reproduces spin-wave theory (SWT).
   Approximations beyond SWT can also be easily made. Interestingly, one
   such approximation produces a convergent, precise number for the order
   parameter of the one-dimensional isotropic model, in contrast to the
   well-known divergence of SWT; it also produces improved results for the
   two-dimensional square-lattice system. We also discuss relations and a
   possible combination of our approach with other established many-body
   theories.}},

Abstract = {{An electromagnetic anti-fouling (EAF) device was built for treating
   scale containing water. In order to validate the effect and identify the
   mechanisms of EAF technology, a series of experiments were carried out,
   both with and without, an EAF device. The fouling thermal resistance was
   measured as a function of time. Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
   images of the fouling layers were obtained and the particle size
   distribution in solution was analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   technology. The main results were as follows: (1) With EAF treatment,
   the crystal phase of calcium carbonate was changed to calcite from the
   aragonite type which exists without EAF treatment; (2) A rapid particle
   growth was observed under EAF treatment conditions. This rapid growth
   was due to that the EAF treatment results in all induced electric field
   inside the bulk flow, and can effectively increase collision frequency
   of the ions and crystals along with the effectiveness of collision. This
   implies that the particle growth was promoted mainly by a coagulation
   process, and not by nucleation growth; (3) The EAF treatment greatly
   reduced the fouling resistance within the time period tested.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment transferring function (F-s) of rivers is defined and indexed in
   this study, based on the concept of sediment budget at river reach
   scales. Then, study is made on the F-s of the lower reaches of the
   Yellow River in relation to natural and human factors in the drainage
   basin, such as the annual precipitation in different water and sediment
   source areas, proportion of >0.05 mm sediment of the total sediment load
   to the lower reaches of Yellow River, the regulated degree of the
   ``clear{''} baseflow from the drainage area above Lanzhou, frequency of
   hyperconcentrated flows, area of soil and water conservation measures in
   the drainage basin. As a result, a multiple regression equation has been
   established between F-s and 7 influencing factors, with multiple
   correlation coefficient r = 0.90.
   The reduction in annual precipitation in different water and sediment
   source areas has different effects on Fs. The reduction in annual
   precipitation in the area above Hekou Town and the area between Longmen
   and Sanmenxia results in a reduction in F-s, but the reduction in annual
   precipitation in the area between Hekou Town and Longmen results in an
   increase in F-s. The grain size composition of sediment load strongly
   affects the F-s; the larger the proportion of >0.05 mm sediment in the
   suspended sediment load entering the lower reaches of the Yellow River
   is, the lower the F-s will be. Thus, if the Xiaolangdi Reservoir traps
   coarse sediment and releases fine sediment, F-s will be enhanced. This
   study also shows that the lower the proportion of high-flow season river
   flow to the annual total river flow at Lanzhou Station is, the lower the
   F-s will be. Therefore, the interception of large quantities of clear
   water by the reservoirs on the upper reaches of Yellow River is one of
   the major causes for the decrease in F-s in the lower reaches of the
   Yellow River.}},

Abstract = {{The vibrational spectra of meso-tetraphenylporphyrin diacid (H4TPP2+)
   have been studied with the density functional theory. Raman and IR
   spectra of H4TPP2+ and its N-deuterated analogue (D4TPP2+) are measured
   and compared with the computational results. Complete assignments of
   observed IR and Raman bands were proposed on the bases of calculation
   results. The DFT calculations reproduce 140 observed fundamentals with
   the RMS 8.6 cm(-1). The computational as well as the experimental
   results reveal that the saddle-distortion of porphyrin macrocycle for
   the diacid leads to a significant effect on its vibrational spectra.
   Especially, several out-of-plane skeletal modes, which were either
   unobserved or very weak in the Raman spectra of CuTPP and H2TPP, are
   activated in the Raman spectra of the diacids. In addition, enhancement
   for the Raman bands of phenyl CC stretching modes were observed and
   attributed to the conjugation effect of IT-systems of the phenyl and the
   porphyrinato macrocycles. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a class of multi-period dynamic supply contracts in
   which a buyer orders a product from a supplier in each period and the
   supplier allows the buyer to cancel a portion of an outstanding order
   with penalty during a planning horizon. We assume that both the buyer
   and the supplier have common knowledge. We first characterize the
   buyer's ordering and canceling policy that minimizes his expected cost
   during the planning horizon. We also characterize the supplier's optimal
   production policy under a very mild assumption on the costs of
   production and storage. Based on this structure, we then use simulation
   to show how the supplier chooses cancellation costs that minimize her
   expected cost during the planning horizon. Our simulation shows that
   both the buyer and the supplier would benefit from the contract. (c)

Abstract = {{The translocation of pre-anthesis nitrogen to the grain is an important
   source for winter wheat. The relation between the nitrogen translocation
   and irrigation regime was studied in the field under a rain-proof trough
   shelter. Nitrogen (N) translocation amount, N translocation efficiency
   decreased with a decline in irrigation amount or by excessive
   irrigation. Compared with different organs, the leaf and stem had higher
   N translocation amounts, and contributions to grain for both cultivars -
   Jinan 17 and Lumai 21, indicating that stem also is a major N source for
   grain development. The contribution of pre-anthesis total above ground N
   to grain N ranged from 57 to 76 \%, indicating the importance of
   pre-anthesis storage of N for achieving high grain N concentrations.
   Grain nitrogen and yield (kg ha(-1)) were positively and significantly
   correlated with the N translocation amounts and contributions,
   respectively, suggesting that the sink strength may be involved in the
   translocation of N from a vegetative organ to the grain. N harvest index
   (NHI) was significantly correlated with N translocation efficiency,
   suggesting that the latter is a prerequisite for increasing grain N and
   improving grain quality. The experiment showed that N translocation
   status is enhanced by better irrigation practices, but limited by
   severely deficient or excessive irrigation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in high-temperature superconductors have facilitated
   the production of high critical current and large-area films by the PLD
   method or MOD method. Nondestructive measurement techniques for high
   quality films are of great importance to estimate superconducting
   properties, such as the critical current density, J(C). The inductive
   method using the third-harmonic voltage component, V-3, is a promising
   technique for the measurement of the properties of J(C). On inductive
   determination of J(C) for high-J(C) thin films and thicker films
   (thickness d >= 0.1 mm), the drive coil must generate a magnetic field
   sufficiently large to break the complete field shielding of the film.
   Therefore, we investigated a mutual inductance technique using a drive
   coil with a sharp ferromagnetic core for investigation of the J(C) of
   the PLD-YBCO film. As a result, an abrupt nonlinear increase in the
   voltage across the pick-up coil was detected after magnetic full
   penetration of the film, and the threshold of the drive current I-th was
   suppressed to 0.23-0.28 times as compared with that measured by the
   inductive method using the third-harmonic voltage, V-3. FEM analysis
   indicated the diameter of the excitation field region to be 0.6 mm in
   the case of a 0.4 mm phi iron core. The E-J characters measured by the
   mutual inductive method as a function of frequency agreed well with
   those measured by the inductive method using V-3. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Exaggerated plasma concentrations of GLP-1 precede reactive hypoglycemia
   after oral glucose in gastrectomy patients, resulting in late dumping
   syndrome. Recently, we showed that GLP-1 elicits the activation of
   sympathetic outflow. Because sympathetic activation is thought to be a
   cause of early dumping. we hypothesized that exaggerated GLP-1 may
   contribute to the pathophysiology of early dumping syndrome. In 11
   patients after gastrectomy and 14 controls, blood pressure, heart rate,
   and plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, epinephrine, GLP-1,
   glucagon, insulin, and glucose were measured after oral glucose. In
   gastrectomy patients, GLP-1, norepinephrine, and heart rate peaked 15 to
   30 min after oral glucose. Significant positive correlations were found
   among GLP-1, norepinephrine, and heart rate at 30 min, and these
   parameters at 30 min were significantly higher in patients with early
   dumping syndrome. These results suggest that GLP-1 is involved in the

Abstract = {{A compact light-emitting diode-induced fluorescence detector based on

   all-solid-state optical-electronic components and easily coupled with

   Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and FITC-labeled amino acids were used
   as test analytes to evaluate the detector performance by capillary
   electrophoresis and flow injection analysis techniques. The
   concentration limit of detection was 10(-8) mol (circle) L-1 for
   FTC-labeled phenylalanine at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3
   (on-column, 0. 05 mm i.d.). The system exhibited a good linear response
   in the range of 1 X 10(-7) -2 X 10(-5) mol (circle) L-1 (r(2) = 0.999).
   The relative standard deviation (RSD) of 6 repetitive injections on peak

   systems. First, several new concepts of practical stability of
   descriptor systems are given. Then some corresponding results parallel
   to those of Lyapunov stability are derived. Thirdly, based on Lyapunov
   functions and the comparison principle, a comparison system which is a
   scalar quantity differential system is established, thereby the problem
   of the practical stability of descriptor systems can be transformed to
   that of a standard state-space system. Finally, as examples, two class
   of linear descriptor systems are considered, and sufficient conditions
   of practical stability are obtained separately; and two nonlinear
   electrical circuit systems are also analyzed using our approaches, which
   validate the results presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of genes Involved in variation of rice root growth
   would assist breeders in creating new cultivars with improved drought
   avoidance. Out of 121 unique transcript-derived fragments (TDFs), which
   differentially expressed in three root sectors (primary root tips,
   lateral roots and adventitious root primordial zones) from an upland
   tropical variety Azucena under drought condition, 113 were anchored to
   the rice high-density linkage maps using their nucleotide sequences.
   Eighteen were in silico mapped on the interval with the common
   quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for root traits in rice. Furthermore,
   nine of these TDFs were mapped onto the rice molecular linkage map using
   a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between IR1552
   and Azucena. All of them were located in regions where QTLs associated
   with root growth under drought are known to lie. Northern blot analysis
   showed that nine genes exhibited different expression patterns in three
   root sectors between parent cultivars tested with respect to drought
   regulation. These nine were the putative candidate genes for root growth
   under drought condition, while they were highly similar to cDNAs
   encoding known proteins including two expansins (OsEXP1 and OsEXP2), two
   xyloglucan endotransferases (XET), an endo-glucanase (EGase), a SART1
   protein, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, a stomatin-like protein and an
   aci-reductone dioxygenase. Among the nine candidates, five genes
   (OsEXP1, OsEXP2, two XET and EGase) are known to be involved in
   expansive growth of cell walls, indicating that drought could stimulate
   root cell growth.}},

Abstract = {{Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-1/redox factor-1 (APE/Ref-1) is a
   multifunctional protein involved in DNA base excision repair and redox
   regulation of many transcription factors. In different melanoma cell
   lines, we found that both nucleus and cytoplasm exhibited higher levels
   of Ref-1 compared with normal melanocytes. Similar increases of Ref-1
   expression, detected by immunohistofluorescence, were also evident in
   nevi and malignant melanoma biopsies compared with normal skin, which
   were predominantly localized in the nucleus. Using recombinant
   adenovirus Adref-1, encoding full-length Ref-1, we transiently
   overexpressed APE/Ref-1 in human melanocytes, which protected these
   cells from UVB-induced apoptosis and increased foci formation in
   culture. Ref-1 overexpression also protected melanoma cells from
   cisplatin- or H2O2-induced apoptosis, whereas increased apoptosis was
   observed with Ref-1 antisense construct infection. These observations
   suggested that intracellular Ref-1 levels played an important role in
   sensitization of melanoma cells to apoptosis. Electrophoretic mobility
   shift assay results showed that in both cultured primary and metastatic
   melanomas DNA-binding activities of activator protein-1 and nuclear
   factor-kappa B were significantly diminished or shifted when
   anti-APE/Ref-1 antibody was added to deplete APE/Ref-1 from the binding
   complexes. Induced nuclear factor-kappa B transcriptional activities
   were also evident after Ref-1 overexpression. Furthermore, using
   three-dimensional molecular structure modeling and virtual screening, we
   found that resveratrol, a natural compound found in fruits and
   vegetables, docks into a druggable pocket of Ref-1 protein. In vitro
   studies revealed that resveratrol inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner,
   Ref-1-activated activator protein-1 DNA-binding activities as well as
   Ref-1 endonuclease activities and rendered melanoma cells more sensitive
   to dacarbazine treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The wavelet transform has been widely used for defect detection and
   classification in fabric images. The detection and classification
   performance of the wavelet transform approach is closely related to the
   selection of the wavelet. Instead of predetermining a wavelet, a method
   of designing a wavelet adapting to the detection or classification of
   the fabric defects has been developed. For further improvement of the
   performance, this paper extends the adaptive wavelet-based methodology
   from the use of a single adaptive wavelet to multiple adaptive wavelets.
   For each class of fabric defect, a defect-specific adaptive wavelet was
   designed to enhance the defect region at one channel of the wavelet
   transform, where the defect region can be detected by using a simple
   threshold classifier. Corresponding to the multiple defect-specific
   adaptive wavelets, the multiscale edge responses to defect regions have
   been shown to be more efficient in characterising the defects, which
   leads to a new approach to the classification of defects. In comparison
   with the single adaptive wavelet approach, the use of multiple adaptive
   wavelets yields better performance on defect detection and
   classification, especially for defects that are poorly detected by the
   single adaptive wavelet approach. The proposed method using multiple
   adaptive wavelets has been evaluated on the inspection of 56 images
   containing eight classes of fabric defects, and 64 images without
   defects, where 98.2\% detection rate and 1.5\% false alarm rate were
   achieved in defect detection, and 97.5\% classification accuracy was
   achieved in defect classification.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence has indicated that endothelin-1 is related to the pathogenesis
   of hypertension. To characterize the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the
   development of pulmonary hypertension syndrome in broilers, the blockade
   effect of ETA receptor (ETA) antagonist, BQ123, on blood pressure in
   experimental models of pulmonary hypertension was examined. Birds were
   locally anesthetized and instrumented with venous catheters for
   pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and right ventricular pressure (RVP),
   followed by packed cell volume (PCV) and Ascites heart index (AIFII)
   measured, after exposed to low ambient temperature for 7 or 14 d. In
   treated groups, BQ123 (0.4 or 2.0 mu g/kg each time, 2 times a day),
   administered in abdominal cavities for 7 or 14 d during birds kept in
   low ambient temperature, prevented both PAP and RVP increasing,
   especially the high dose BQ123 lowered PAP and RVP to normotensive
   levels as that in control under normal temperature, whereas significant
   increases (p<0.05) were found in the two parameters of broilers in both
   untreated and saline treated group under low ambient temperature
   compared with those of birds in control. Furthermore, there was also a
   reduction in low ambient temperature-induced right ventricular
   hypertrophy in the groups administered BQ123. The preventive effect of
   BQ123 suggests that ET-1 is associated with the development of broilers'
   pulmonary hypertension, which leads to the development of ascites, and
   BQ123 can prevent the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{The reaction of N(S-4) + CH3X (X = CI, Br) was studied by the ab initio
   method. The geometries of the reactants, transition states and products
   were optimized at the MP2/6-311 + G (d, p) level, The corresponding
   vibration frequencies were calculated at the same level. The
   single-point calculations for all the stationary points were carried out
   at the MP2/6-311 ++ G(3df,2p) and the QCISD(T)/6-311 + G(d,p) levels
   using the MP2/6311 + G ( d, p) optimized geometries. The energies of all
   the stationary points were calculated by the G2MP2 method. The results
   of this theoretical study indicate that the reaction has three reaction
   channels: H abstraction reaction channel a, Cl or Br abstraction
   reaction channel b and substitution reaction channel c. For the N (4S) +
   CH3Cl reaction, reaction channel a is the main reaction channel.
   Reaction channels b and c may have a slight contribution in the
   reaction. For the N(S-4) + CH, Br reaction, reaction channel a is the
   main reaction channel. Reaction channels b and c may have some

Abstract = {{Laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal carcinoma has never been
   widely accepted among general surgeons because of the technical
   difficulties encountered during pelvic dissection. We describe our
   technique of hand-assisted laparoscopic low anterior resection (HAL-LAR)
   for rectal carcinoma using the Lapdisc abdominal wall sealing device
   (Hakko Medical, Tokyo, Japan, and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, New Brunswick,
   New Jersey) which results in pelvic dissection almost equivalent to the
   laparotomic operation. Thirteen patients with rectal adenocarcinoma
   (lower edge less than 15 cm from the anal verge) underwent laparoscopic
   low anterior resection, including 8 standard laparoscopic low anterior
   resections (SL-LAR) and 5 HAL-LAR. The mean operative time in the
   HAL-LAR group (211 +/- 48 min) was significantly shorter than in the
   SL-LAR group (311 +/- 78 min) (P = 0.0268). The mean intraoperative
   blood loss in the HAL-LAR group (37 +/- 45 g) was less than that in the
   SL-LAR group (198 +/- 177 g) (P = 0.075). The mean distal margin in the
   HAL-LAR group (23 +/- 4.5 mm) was longer than in the SL-LAR group (15
   +/- 13.1 mm) (P = 0.2199). One patient in the SL-LAR group was found to
   have anastomotic recurrence in the staple suture line 10 months after
   surgery and died from cancer 24 months after surgery. One patient in the
   SL-LAR group was converted to open surgery because the distal margin was
   insufficient. In the HAL-LAR group, there were no intra- or
   postoperative complications, no conversion to open surgery, and no
   recurrence after surgery.}},

Abstract = {{In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exceeding conventional
   (T2) criteria for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), the
   feasibility and outcome following loco-regional therapy intended for
   tumor downstaging to meet T2 criteria for OLT are unknown. In this first
   prospective study on downstaging of HCC prior to OLT, the eligibility
   criteria for enrollment into a downstaging protocol included 1 lesion >5
   cm and <= 8 cm, 2 or 3 lesions at least 1 >3 cm but <= 5 cm with total
   tumor diameter of <= 8 cm, or 4 or 5 nodules all <= 3 cm with total
   tumor diameter <= 8 cm. Patients were eligible for living-donor liver
   transplantation (LDLT) if tumors were downstaged to within proposed
   University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria. (13)A minimum
   follow-up period of 3 months after downstaging was required before
   cadaveric OLT or LDLT, with imaging studies meeting criteria for
   successful downstaging. Among the 30 patients enrolled, 21 (70\%) met
   criteria for successful downstaging, including 16 (53\%) who had
   subsequently received OLT (2 with LDLT), and 9 patients (30\%) were
   classified as treatment failures. In the explant of 16 patients who
   underwent OLT, 7 had complete tumor necrosis, 7 met T2 criteria, but 2
   exceeded T2 criteria. No HCC recurrence was observed after a median
   follow-up of 16 months after OLT. The Kaplan-Meier intention-to-treat
   survival was 89.3 and 81.8\% at I and 2 yr, respectively. In conclusion,
   successful tumor downstaging can be achieved in the majority of
   carefully selected patients, but longer follow-up is needed to further
   access the risk of HCC recurrence after OLT.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Incisional hernias develop in 2 to 20\% of laparotomy
   incisions. Approximately 100,000 ventral hernias are operated on each
   year in the United States. The reported recurrence rates for open repair
   are 25-52\% for primary and 12.5-19\% for mesh repair. Compared to the
   open technique, laparoscopic repair has low rates of complications and
   recurrence, greater patient acceptance, and shorter hospital stay.
   Materials and Methods: Between April 1999 and April 2004, we treated 150
   patients (111 female, 39 male) with ventral and incisional hernias
   laparoscopically. Data concerning the age and sex of patients, the
   location, number, and size of fascial defects, the type of hernias and
   their contents, the size and type of meshes used in repair, operative
   time, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications were
   collected.
   Results: Of the 150 patients, 92 had incisional hernias and 58 had
   umbilical hernias. Polypropylene was used in 85 cases, dual mesh in 40
   cases, and composite mesh in 25 cases. The mean age of the patients was
   56.0 years (range, 33-81 years). Mean operative time was 63 minutes
   (range, 30-125 minutes). Mean postoperative hospital stay was 2.5 days
   (range, 1-15 days). The postoperative complication rate was 8.6\%
   (seroma, paralytic ileus, small bowel injury, and suture-site
   neuralgia). The mean follow-up period was 32 months (range, 4-60
   months). There was a 3\% recurrence rate. Three subileus cases were
   detected during follow-up.
   Conclusion: The laparoscopic approach to ventral and incisional hernias
   is safe, feasible, and a good alternative to the open approach. Our
   results are comparable with those of other reports in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. - To investigate the relationship between the major depression and
   bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women.
   Material and methods. - We compared BMD, plasma cortisol level,
   osteocalcin and C-telopeptide levels of 35 premenopausal women with
   major depression with those of 30 healthy women who were matched for age
   and body mass index. Major depression was diagnosed according to
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition)
   criteria. Nineteen patients had mild and 16 patients had moderate
   severity of major depression as measured by Hamilton rating scale for
   depression.
   Results. - Women with any risk factor for osteoporosis were excluded
   from the study. All women underwent BMD measurement by DEXA at lumbar
   (L2-4) and femoral neck region. After an overnight fasting, plasma
   cortisol levels were measured at 08:00 h by using competitive
   immunoassay method. Osteocalcin and C-telopeptide were used for the
   evaluation of bone turnover. There were no significant differences in
   BMD, plasma cortisol level, osteocalcin and C-telopeptide levels between
   the patients and the control groups. There was also no correlation
   between the plasma cortisol level, the duration and the severity of
   disease, antidepressant drug use and BMD.
   Conclusion. - Major depression had no significant effect on BMD and bone
   turnover markers in our patient group of mild to moderate severity of
   the disorder. (C) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.}},

   tumour cell lines where the induction of differentiation and apoptosis
   are the prime effects. The mechanism of As2O3-induced cell death has yet
   to be clarified, especially in solid cancers.
   2. In the present study, the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was
   examined as a cellular model for As2O3 treatment. The involvement of
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and c-Jun N-terminal
   kinase (JNK) was investigated in As2O3-induced cell death.
   3. It was found that As2O3 activates the prosurvival mitogen-activated
   protein kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells, which,
   conversely, may compromise the efficacy of As2O3. Hence, a combination
   treatment of As2O3 and MEK inhibitors was investigated to determine
   whether this treatment could lead to enhanced growth inhibition and
   apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.
   4. Inhibition of MEK/ERK with the pharmacological inhibitors U0126 (10
   mu mol/L) or PD98059 (20 mu mol/L) together with As2O3 (2 and 5 mu
   mol/L) resulted in a significant enhancement of growth inhibition in
   breast cancer MCF-7 cells as determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2
   thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay and
   {[}Methyl-H-3]-thymidine incorporation. Furthermore, the results
   demonstrated that combined treatment with As2O3 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor
   U0126 could augment breast cancer MCF-7 cell apoptosis approximately
   twofold compared with the effects of the two drugs alone, as determined
   by Hoechst 33258 or annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow
   cytometry.
   5. In addition, As2O3 activated p38 in a dose-dependent manner, but had
   no effect on JNK1/2. Treatment with a p38 inhibitor did not prevent
   As2O3-induced apoptosis.
   6. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that enhanced
   apoptosis is detected in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in the presence of
   As2O3 and an MEK inhibitor, which may be a new promising adjuvant to
   current breast cancer treatments.}},

Abstract = {{A summer camp was followed by an outbreak of illness involving around 90
   children. Investigations included individual questionnaires, inspection
   of the camp facilities, and laboratory analysis of water and clinical
   samples. Contamination of drinking and swimming water was demonstrated.
   An enterovirus was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or
   culture in 4/4 cerebrospinal fluid samples, 9/15 (60 \%) stool samples
   from symptomatic children and 2/9 (22 \%) stool samples from
   asymptomatic children. The virus was identified as an echovirus 3 by
   sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a short 5' non-coding region
   (NCR) PCR product. Viruses from the outbreak clustered closely and an
   echovirus 3 from a temporally associated non-outbreak case could be
   readily distinguished. Despite the lack of a standardized approach,
   direct molecular detection and identification of enteroviruses is an
   efficient epidemiological tool. Here the 5'-NCR was successfully used
   for both detection and `serotyping', and the close genetic relatedness
   of isolates was proven.}},

Abstract = {{To alleviate the need for daily injection of porcine somatotropin (pST),
   a sustained-release implant (pSTSR) was devised that continuously
   delivers a daily dose of 2 mg of pST for 42 d. Ninety-six white
   composite (Large White x Landrace) finishing barrows (83.6 +/- 1.2 kg
   BW) were assigned to receive zero or two pSTSR implants (4 mg pST/d) and
   to consume one of six diets differing in total Lys concentration (0.29,
   0.52, 0.75, 0.98, 1.21, or 1.44\%, as-fed basis). Diets were formulated
   to be isocaloric and based on the ideal protein concept. Pigs were
   housed individually, allowed ad libitum access to feed and water, and
   slaughtered at 112 kg of BW. The pSTSR affected neither ADG (P = 0.88)
   nor 10th rib LM area (LMA; P = 0.51), but it decreased (P < 0.01) ADFI,
   average backfat thickness, 10th rib fat depth, weights of leaf fat and
   ham fat, improved (P < 0.05) G:F, and increased (P < 0.01) weights of
   four trimmed lean cuts (T-cuts), and percentages of ham lean and bone.
   Increasing total Lys increased ADG (quadratic; P < 0.05) and ADFI
   (linear; P < 0.01). The G:F, plasma urea N concentrations (PUN), and
   T-cuts were affected by the interaction pSTSR x dietary Lys (P < 0.01).
   Without pSTSR, the G:F did not differ (P = 0.37) among pigs fed 0.52\%
   and greater total Lys. With pSTSR, the G:F was less (P < 0.05) for pigs
   fed 0.52\% than 0.98 and 1.44\% total Lys. Increases in dietary total
   Lys resulted in increased PUN (P < 0.01), and incremental increases were
   less in pSTSR-implanted pigs. Maximal yield of T-cuts was at 0.98\%
   dietary total Lys in nonimplanted pigs and 1.21\% total Lys in
   pSTSR-implanted pigs. Estimates of total Lys requirements of pigs
   without and with pSTSR, respectively, were 0.52 and 0.86\% for growth
   (ADG and G:F) and 0.73 and 0.88\% for lean production (LMA and T-cuts).
   Equivalent apparent ileal digestible Lys requirements of pigs without
   and with pSTSR, respectively, were 0.44 and 0.68\% for growth, and 0.62
   and 0.75\% for lean production. With ADFI of 3.5 kg daily, an intake of
   approximately 26.1 g of total daily Lys (0.75\%) or 22.4 g of apparent
   ileal digestible Lys is needed to maximize lean production in finishing
   barrows receiving 4 mg pST/d via sustained-release implant.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To test the hypothesis that third grade children (mean
   age=8.7, SD=0.5) who attended an 8-month after-school program would
   exhibit favorable changes in body composition, cardiovascular fitness,
   blood pressure, total cholesterol, and high-density
   lipoprotein-cholesterol compared with children in control condition.
   Research Methods and Procedures: Subjects were 61\% African-American,
   31\% white, and 8\% other racial background from 18 public schools.
   Sixty-eight percent were eligible for free or reduced price lunch.
   Percentage body fat and bone mineral density were assessed by DXA,
   cardiovascular fitness by heart rate response to a step test, resting
   blood pressure with a Dinamap, and non-fasting total cholesterol and
   high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol by finger stick. Data pre- and
   post-intervention were available for 447 children. Children in the nine
   intervention schools who attended at least 40\% of the after-school
   sessions were compared with control Subjects.
   Results: Compared with the control subjects and after controlling for
   race, sex, free/reduced price lunch status, and school-level covariates,
   youths in the intervention group showed a relative reduction of
   percentage body fat {[}-0.76 (95\% confidence interval (CI), -1.42,
   -0.09)],, a greater relative gain in bone mineral density {[}0.008 (95\%
   CI, 0.001, 0.005)], and a greater relative reduction in heart rate
   response to the step test {[}-4.4 (95\% CI, -8.2, 0.6)]. The other
   Outcome variables showed non-significant trends in favor of the
   intervention Subjects.
   Discussion: These results are promising in light of the potential impact
   on the emerging childhood obesity epidemic. The Medical College of
   Georgia FitKid Project has the potential to be institutionalized because
   it is built on the existing infrastructure in most public schools in the
   U.S.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the extent of organic solvent and water retention in
   comonomer blends with different hydropbilicity (Hoy's solubility
   parameter for hydrogen bonding, delta(h)) after solvent evaporation, and
   the extent of tracer penetration in polymerised films prepared from
   these resins. For each comonomer blend, adhesive/solvent mixtures were
   prepared by addition of (1) 50 wt\% acetone, (2) 50 wt\% ethanol, (3) 30
   wt\% acetone and 20 wt\% water and (4) 30 wt\% ethanol and 20 wt\%
   water. The mixtures were placed in glass wells and evaporated for 30-60
   s for acetone-based resins, and 60-120 s for ethanol-based resins. The
   weight of the comonomer mixtures was measured before and after solvent
   evaporation. Resin films were prepared for transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) after immersion in ammonical silver nitrate. The
   percentages of solvent and water retained in the comonomer mixtures, and
   between the acetone and ethanol groups were measured gravimetrically and
   were statistically compared. In comonomer-organic solvent mixtures, the
   percentage of solvent retained in acetone and ethanol-based mixtures
   increased significantly with hydrophilicity of the comonomer blends (P <
   0.05). In resin-organic solvent-water mixtures, significantly more
   solvent and water were retained in the ethanol-based mixtures (P <
   0.0001), when compared to acetone-based mixtures after 60 s of
   air-drying. TEM revealed residual water being trapped as droplets in
   resin films containing acetone and water. Water-filled channels were
   seen along the film periphery of all groups and throughout the entire
   resin films containing ethanol and water. The addition of water to
   comonome methanol mixtures results in increased retention of both
   ethanol and water because both solvents can hydrogen bond to the
   monomers. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We have performed elastic neutron scattering experiments under uniaxial
   stress sigma applied along the tetragonal {[}100], {[}110], and {[}001]
   directions for the heavy-electron compound URu2Si2. We found that
   antiferromagnetic (AF) order with large moment is developed with sigma
   along the {[}100] and {[}110] directions. If the order is assumed to be
   homogeneous, the staggered ordered moment mu(o) continuously increases
   from 0.02 mu(B)/U(sigma=0) to 0.22 mu(B)/U (0.25 GPa). The rate of
   increase partial derivative mu(o)/partial derivative sigma is similar to
   1.0 mu(B)/GPa, which is four times larger than that for the hydrostatic
   pressure (partial derivative mu(o)/partial derivative P similar to 0.25
   mu(B)/GPa). Above 0.25 GPa, mu(o) shows a tendency to saturate, similar
   to the hydrostatic pressure behavior. For sigma parallel to{[}001],
   mu(o) shows only a slight increase to 0.028 mu(B)/U(sigma=0.46 GPa) with
   a rate of similar to 0.02 mu(B)/GPa, indicating that the development of
   the AF state highly depends on the direction of sigma. We have also
   found a clear hysteresis loop in the isothermal mu(o)(sigma) curve
   obtained for sigma parallel to{[}110] under the zero-stress-cooled
   condition at 1.4 K. This strongly suggests that the sigma-induced AF
   phase is metastable, and separated from the ``hidden order{''} phase by
   a first-order phase transition. We discuss these experimental results on
   the basis of crystalline strain effects and elastic energy calculations,
   and show that the c/a ratio plays a key role in the competition between
   these two phases.}},

Abstract = {{Reconstruction of middle hepatic vein (MHV) tributaries is controversial
   in right-lobe living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). This study
   aimed to evaluate the appropriateness of reconstructing MRV tributaries
   by volumetry using 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT). Between
   November 2003 and January 2005, 42 donor livers (right-lobe graft, n =
   25; left-lobe graft, n = 17) were evaluated using this software. The
   total congestion volume (CV) associated with the MHV tributaries and the
   inferior right hepatic vein (IRHV), and graft volume (GV) were
   calculated. In recipients with right-lobe grafts, CV/(right liver volume
   {[}RLV]) and (GV - CV)/(standard liver volume {[}SLV]) were compared
   between 2 groups: with reconstruction (n = 16) and without
   reconstruction (n = 9). To evaluate the influence of CV on the remnant
   right lobe in donors, total bilirubin was compared between 2 groups:
   high CV (CV > 20\%, n = 13) or low CV (CV:5 20\%, n = 4). The mean
   CV/RLV ratio was 32.3 +/- 17.1\% M, 15.2 +/- 9.9\%; V8, 9.2 +/- 4.1\%;
   and IRHV, 8.5 +/- 11.4\%) and the maximum ratio was as high as 80.8\%.
   The mean (GV - CV)/SLV ratio before reconstruction in patients with or
   without reconstruction resulted in 33.5 +/- 12.8\% and 55.4 +/- 12.9\%,
   respectively (P < 0.01). In donors, total bilirubin was significantly
   high in the high CV group on postoperative day I compared with the low
   CV group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, calculation of CV using 3D-CT
   software proved to be very useful. We concluded that this evaluation
   should be an integral part of procedure planning, especially for
   right-lobe LDLT.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Although return to work (RTW) is a phenomenon that has
   been researched for many years, our ability to understand and improve
   outcomes is still limited. As an avenue for advancing the field, this
   paper presents an alternative way of thinking about RTW. Method: The
   conceptualization was constructed based on a review of the literature
   and the comments of RTW and workers' compensation researchers. Results:
   RTW is presented as an evolving process, comprising four key phases:
   i.e., ``off work,{''} ``work re-entry,{''} ``retention,{''} and
   ``advancement.{''} In addition, multiple phase-specific outcomes that
   may be used to evaluate RTW success are advanced. Conclusion: Broadening
   thinking about RTW to take into consideration the complexities of its
   developmental nature holds promise for understanding and improving RTW,
   as it not only clarifies the importance of incremental milestones, but
   also facilitates intervention choice and evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{A Chinese bituminous coal was crushed in a jaw crusher and ground to
   micrometer size in a planetary ball mill. Three laboratory standard
   sieves, with a sieve size of 63, 100, and 200 mu m, respectively, were
   used to obtain three coal fractions with different average diameter. The
   effect of particle size on the proximate composition and combustion
   properties of these samples was studied by proximate analysis,
   thermogravimetry (TG), differential thermogravimetry (DTG), and
   differential scanning calorimetry, (DSC). Petrographic analysis showed
   that the content of vitrinite increased and that of inertinite decreased
   slightly with decreasing particle size, which was thought to contribute
   to increasing volatile yield (ad) for fine coal particles. When particle
   size decreased, the content of fixed carbon decreased and that of ash
   decreased and then increased. Combustion experiments in a thermobalance
   revealed that with increasing particle size, the whole burning profile
   shifted to higher temperatures, resulting in an increase in
   characteristic temperatures. It implied that finer coal particles
   exhibited higher reactivity. This was explained from the point of view
   of maceral enrichment effects, mass transfer effects, and different
   physical properties of coal particles and the resulting chars due to
   different particle size. The results also indicated that simultaneous
   reactions of volatiles and char might happen at low temperatures for
   small particles. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Skew estimation for textual document images is a well-researched topic
   and numerals of methods have been reported in the literature. One of the
   major challenges is the presence of interfering non-textual objects of
   various types and quantities in the document images. Many existing
   methods require proper separation of the textual objects which are well
   aligned from the non-textual objects which are mostly nonaligned. Some
   comparative evaluation work on the existing methods chooses only the
   text zones of the test image database. Therefore, the object filtering
   or zoning stage is crucial to the skew detection stage. However, it is
   difficult if not impossible to design general-purpose filters that are
   able to discriminate noises from textual components. This paper presents
   a robust, general-purpose skew estimation method that does not need any
   filtering or zoning preprocessing. In fact, this method does apply
   filtering, but not on the input components at the beginning of the
   detection process, rather on the output spectrum at the end of the
   detection process. Therefore, the problem of finding a textual component
   filter has been transformed into finding a convolution filter on the
   output accumulator array. This method consists of three steps: (1) the

Abstract = {{The plasma diagnostic method using the transmission attenuation of
   microwaves at double frequencies (PDMUTAMDF) indicates that the
   frequency and the electron-neutral collision frequency of the plasma can
   be deduced by utilizing the transmission attenuation of microwaves at
   two neighboring frequencies in a non-magnetized plasma. Then the
   electron density can be obtained from the plasma frequency. The
   PDMUTAMDF is a simple method to diagnose the plasma indirectly. In this
   paper, the interaction of electromagnetic waves and the plasma is
   analyzed. Then, based on the attenuation and the phase shift of a
   microwave in the plasma, the principle of the PDMUTAMDF is presented.
   With the diagnostic method, the spatially mean electron density and
   electron collision frequency of the plasma can be obtained. This method
   is suitable for the elementary diagnosis of the atmospheric-pressure
   plasma.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of sodium phytate supplementation on fat digestion and
   cholesterol metabolism were investigated in female rats. On the basis of
   an in vitro experiment showing that phytate raised the solubility of
   bile acids, it was predicted that phytate feeding would depress faecal
   bile acid excretion, raise apparent fat digestibility and elevate serum
   cholesterol concentrations. The experimental diets with or without
   sodium phytate were either cholesterol-free or cholesterol-rich and had
   a normal calcium concentration. Rats fed on the cholesterol-rich diet
   with sodium phytate showed enhanced faecal bile acid excretion, but
   there was no effect on fat digestibility. In rats fed the
   cholesterol-free diets, phytate did neither affect fat digestion nor
   bile acid excretion. Sodium phytate inclusion in the cholesterol-rich
   diet raised serum cholesterol concentrations, but reduced liver
   cholesterol concentration. Thus, the in vivo data do not agree with the
   in vitro observations. Both phytate and cholesterol feeding influenced
   mineral and trace element metabolism. Liver zinc concentrations were
   raised by phytate feeding. Cholesterol consumption reduced hepatic
   concentrations of copper, iron and zinc. Both phytate and cholesterol
   feeding reduced the apparent absorption of calcium, magnesium and

Abstract = {{In this study, I have examined how teenagers who become pregnant
   experience school and how their beliefs about school are affected by
   their pregnancy and motherhood. Using a grounded theory approach, the
   perspectives of 9 young mothers in a teen parents' program were analyzed
   to determine how these women reflected on their educational experience
   both before and after their pregnancy and on how having a child may have
   affected their self-understanding, particularly in relation to their
   schooling. The overarching theme that arose from participants' responses
   was that having a child substantially influenced their perspectives of
   both their schooling and their future. Although each stated that her
   pregnancy initially led her to drop out of school, the participants
   argued that having a child increased their interest in their education
   and pushed them to see how education would help them provide a better
   future for their children, increase their employment opportunities, and
   help them get off public assistance. In contrast to previous research,
   which has argued that teen motherhood puts women at a greater risk for
   school difficulties, this study reveals that motherhood may also be a
   factor in helping women reevaluate their perspective of school and
   school's importance for their lives.}},

Abstract = {{We are addressing a possible approach to the decomposition of surface
   electromyograms (SEMGs). It is based on higher-order cumulants
   implemented in a two-step procedure. Firstly, a multivariate version of
   the w-slice method is applied in order to extract coarse approximations
   of motor-unit action potentials (MUAPs) out of the measured SEMGs.
   Secondly, these coarse estimates are refined by modified Newton-Gauss
   iteration to achieve an optimum fit of the model-based and the
   observation-based cumulant estimates. All the necessary conditions are
   derived theoretically and, afterwards, implemented in simulation runs in
   order to prove the decomposition power of the proposed approach on
   synthetic SEMGs. The first-norm difference between the original and the
   decomposed MUAPs, obtained at the signal length of 102400 samples and
   expressed in percentage of the MUAP amplitude span, yields 5.4\% in the
   noise-free case, 6.0\% with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10dB, and

Abstract = {{A series of catalysts with (Ce-Zr-La-Pr)O contents range from 0 to 50\%
   in coating and single-palladium loads on substrates were prepared to
   study effects of (Ce-Zr-La-Pr)O contents on catalytic activities and
   durability by contrasting the characteristics of light-off, A/F and
   catalytic conversions of the fresh catalysts with that of the aged
   catalysts. The results show that (Ce-Zr-La-Pr)O can enhance the
   catalysts light-off characteristics, widen A/F windows and increase
   catalytic conversions at a certain extent through optimizing physical
   structural and chemical property of the mixed coating. However,
   (Ce-Zr-La-Pr)O contents influence greatly on the catalysts activities
   and durability, and the catalysts with contents ranging from 10\% to
   30\% exhibited better integrative properties in ail samples, and 10\%
   was the optical content to make the catalyst performance highest in this
   thesis. It is indicated that an suitable content of (Ce-Zr-La-Pr)O plays
   an important role in assisting catalysis, enhancing durability and
   increasing oxygen storage capability.}},

Abstract = {{More than 100 mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase ( SOD) gene
   have been found, accounting for about 20\% of familial ALS (FALS).
   However, few have been identified in Chinese patients with FALS. We
   present a five-generation Chinese family with FALS with a rare mutation
   in exon 4 of the Cu/Zn SOD gene codon position 105, converting serine to
   leucine. Forty-seven family members including the proband were examined
   clinically; two affected persons had EMG and nerve conduction studies.
   Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of the family
   members after informed consent. All five exons of the Cu/Zn SOD gene
   were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing was
   performed on purified products. Exon 4 of the Cu/Zn SOD gene was
   amplified from genomic DNA isolated from not only the family members but
   also from 50 unrelated healthy Chinese control subjects. A rare S105L
   mutation, which is heterozygous with C by T at position 1125 of the
   coding sequence in exon 4 of the Cu/Zn SOD gene, was found in the
   proband and her affected elder brother. The clinical phenotype within
   the FALS patients in this family is relatively variable. The age at
   onset ranged from 32 to 65 years, with initial symptoms in either the
   upper or lower extremities in different family members. Two subjects
   aged 72 and 60 years remained asymptomatic until their death from other
   causes, although their offspring carrying the same mutation have already
   developed clinical evidence of the disease. The S105L mutation was
   identified in another seven asymptomatic family members, aged 7 to 59
   years. It is concluded that the S105L mutation in exon 4 of the Cu/Zn
   SOD gene is pathogenic. The phenotype is characterized by relatively
   variable clinical symptoms, with incomplete penetrance.}},

Abstract = {{Fibronectin (FN) was found to be up-regulated in human oesophageal
   squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by cDNA microarray analysis in our
   laboratory. In order to elucidate the chronology of FN expression at
   various stages of oesophageal carcinogenesis, RTPCR,
   immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were carried out on ESCC
   tissue samples with different pathological characteristics. FN was
   mainly localized in the interstitial tissues, and its up-regulation in
   ESCC was significantly associated with the depth of invasion by
   carcinoma (R = 0.803, p < 0.01). To investigate its relationship with
   the Erk pathway further, pRaf-1 and pErk-1/2 expression were also
   analysed in ESCC. Activation of Erk1/2 and Raf was identified in 63.3\%
   and 60.3\% of the tumour specimens, respectively, whereas normal mucosal
   epithelial tissues were negative. Moreover, a close association was
   observed between pErk-1/2 expression and the differentiation grade (R =
   -0.421, p = 0.002): pErk-1/2 signal was greater in poorly differentiated
   tissues than in well and moderately differentiated tissues.
   Co-expression of FN and pErk-1/2 was found at the invasive front of
   tumour nests by double immunofluorescence staining and there was a
   statistical correlation between the expression of FN and pErk-1/2 (p <
   0.05). In the cell line EC9706, plasma FN was able to phosphorylate Raf
   and further activate Erk, but it did not alter MMP-2 protein expression
   or activity, indicating that MMP-2 may not be the downstream target gene
   of the Erk pathway. All the above data suggest that the up-regulation of
   FN contributes to the later stage of oesophageal carcinogenesis, and
   that activation of the Erk pathway may be involved in the roles of FN in
   ESCC. Copyright (c) 2005 Pathological Society of Great Britain and

Abstract = {{The molecular modification of the pain pathway represents one of the
   major mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain. Recently, gene array
   studies have been carried out to identify the genes that are regulated
   at the spinal cord level after peripheral nerve injury. These studies
   demonstrate that peripheral nerve injury causes marked changes in gene
   expression in both the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and the dorsal spinal
   cord. The markedly regulated molecules include, for example,
   neuropeptides, receptors, ion channels, signal transduction molecules
   and synaptic vesicle proteins. Upregulation of the Ca2+ channel alpha
   2/delta 1 subunit, gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor alpha 5 subunit,
   Na+ channels and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the DRG and dorsal
   spinal cord indicates their potential roles in neuropathic pain control.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The graft protective effect of ulinastatin (UTI) against
   ischemia-reperfusion injury in small bowel transplantation (SBT) was
   verified with a rat SBT model. This study was carried out to investigate
   the effects of UTI on the accumulation and adhesion of neutrophils.
   Methods. Twenty-four recipients of rat SBTs were randomly divided into a
   control group and a UTI group. UTI was injected intravenously into the
   donor (before harvest of the graft) and into the recipient (50,000
   U/kg/d). Variables included graft pathological score; myeloperoxidase
   content (MPO); expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)
   in the graft and plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in
   the recipient.
   Results. The pathological changes of control group grafts were more
   significant than those of the UTI group. The content of MPO and
   expression of ICAM-1 in transplanted small intestines were lower among
   the UTI group as were plasma concentrations of TNF.
   Conclusions. UTI may ameliorate graft ischemia-reperfusion injury in SBT
   through decreasing accumulation and adhesion of neutrophils.}},

Abstract = {{Using 80 CME-ICME events during 1997.1-2002.9, based on the eruptive
   source locations of CMEs and solar magnetic field observation at the
   photosphere, a current sheet magnetic coordinate (CIVIC) system is
   established in order to study the propagation of CME and its
   geoeffectiveness. In context of this coordinate system, the effect of
   the eruptive source location and the form of heliospheric current sheet
   (HCS) at the eruptive time of CME on the geomagnetic storm intensity
   caused by CME and the CME's transit time at the Earth is investigated in
   detail. Our preliminary conclusions are: 1) The geomagnetic disturbances
   caused by CMEs tend to have the so-called ``same side-opposite side
   effect'', i.e. CMEs erupt from the same side of the HCS as the earth
   would be more likely to arrive at the earth and the geomagnetic
   disturbances associated with them tend to be of larger magnitude, while
   CMEs erupting from the opposite side would arrive at the earth with less
   probability and the corresponding geomagnetic disturbance magnitudes
   would be relatively weaker. 2) The angular separation between the earth
   and the HCS affect the corresponding disturbance intensity. That is,
   when our earth is located near the HCS, adverse space weather events
   occur most probably. 3) The erupting location of the CME and its nearby
   form of HCS will also affect its arrival time at the earth. According to
   these conclusions, in this context of CIVIC coordinate we arrive at new
   prediction method for estimating the geomagnetic storm intensity
   (Dst(min)) caused by CMEs and their transit times. The application of
   the empirical model for 80 CME-ICME events shows that the relative error
   of Dst is within 30\% for 59\% events with Dst(min) <=-50 nT, while the
   averaged absolute error of transit time is lower than 10 h for all
   events.}},

Abstract = {{The enterobacterium Erwinia amylovora is a devastating plant pathogen
   causing necrotrophic fire blight disease of apple, pear, and other
   rosaceous plants. In this study, we used a modified in vivo expression
   technology system to identify E. amylovora genes that are activated
   during infection of immature pear tissue, a process that requires the
   major pathogenicity factors of this organism. We identified 394 unique
   pear fruit-induced (pfi) genes on the basis of sequence similarity to
   known genes and separated them into nine putative function groups
   including host-microbe interactions (3.8\%), stress response (5.3\%),
   regulation (11.9\%), cell surface (8.9\%), transport (13.5\%), mobile
   elements (1.0\%), metabolism (20.3\%), nutrient acquisition and
   synthesis (15.5\%), and unknown or hypothetical proteins (19.8\%). Known
   virulence genes, including hrp/hrc components of the type III secretion
   system, the major effector gene dspE, type II secretion, levansucrase
   (lsc), and regulators of levansucrase and amylovoran biosynthesis, were
   upregulated during pear tissue infection. Known virulence factors
   previously identified in E. (Pectobacterium) carotovora and Pseudomonas
   syringae were identified for the first time in E. amylovora and included
   HecA hemagglutinin family adhesion, Peh polygalacturonase, new effector
   HopPtoC(EA), and membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase MItE(EA).
   An insertional mutation within hopPtoC(EA) did not result in reduced
   virulence; however, an mltE(EA) knockout mutant was reduced in virulence
   and growth in immature pears. This study suggests that E. amylovora
   utilizes a variety of strategies during plant infection and to overcome
   the stressful and poor nutritional environment of its plant hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Although cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in most
   nations, the spectrum of cancer occurrence varies substantially
   worldwide. Most previous epidemiologic studies investigating cancer
   etiology were conducted in North American and western European countries
   that are relatively homogenous in terms of cancer spectrums and many
   lifestyle exposures. These limitations may have hindered these studies
   from evaluating some important etiologic hypotheses. From 1996 to 2000,
   the Shanghai Women's Health Study recruited 74,942 adult Chinese women
   from selected urban communities, with a 92\% response rate. All
   participants completed a detailed baseline survey and anthropometrics.
   Approximately 88\% of cohort members donated a urine sample (n = 65,755)
   and a blood (n = 56,832) or exfoliated buccal cell (n = 8,934) sample.
   Noteworthy characteristics of this cohort include low consumption of
   alcohol (1.9\%) and use of tobacco (2.4\%); high intake of fish (mean,
   50.8 g/day), soy foods (mean, 142.3 g/day), and certain vegetables; low
   prevalence of obesity (5.1\%); and nearly 100\% employment outside the
   home. Currently, this cohort of women is being followed via biennial
   in-person recontact and periodic linkage to cancer and vital statistics
   registries. The resources from the cohort will be valuable in future
   studies of environmental exposures and biomarkers for the risk of cancer
   and other chronic diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The T-cell antigen-activated signaling pathway is a highly regulated
   intracellular biochemical system that is crucial for initiating an
   appropriate adaptive immune response. To improve the understanding of
   the complex regulatory mechanisms controlling the early events in T-cell
   signaling, a detailed mathematical model was developed that utilizes
   ordinary differential equations to describe chemical reactions of the
   signaling pathway. The model parameter values were constrained by
   experimental data on the activation of a specific signaling intermediate
   and indicated an initial rapid cascade of phosphorylation events
   followed by a comparatively slow signal downregulation. Nonlinear
   analysis of the model suggested that thresholding and bistability occur
   as a result of the embedded positive and negative feedback loops within
   the model. These nonlinear system properties may enhance the T-cell
   receptor specificity and provide sub-threshold noise filtering with
   switch-like behavior to ensure proper cell response. Additional analysis
   using a reduced second-order model led to further understanding of the
   observed system behavior. Moreover, the interactions between the
   positive and negative feedback loops enabled the model to exhibit, among
   a variety of other feasible dynamics, a sustained oscillation that
   corresponds to a stable limit cycle in the two-dimensional phase plane.
   Quantitative analysis in this paper has helped identify potential
   regulatory mechanisms in the early T-cell signaling events. This
   integrated approach provides a framework to quantify and discover the
   ensemble of interconnected T-cell antigen-activated signaling pathways
   from limited experimental data. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Despite numerous investigations, all previous efforts on thermodynamic
   modeling of Al-Mg have suffered from inaccurate energetics of solid
   phases. In the present work, the first-principles calculations were
   performed using VASP based on the pseudo-potentials and a plane wave
   basis set. The enthalpies of formation of the epsilon-Al30Mg23 phase,
   end-members of the gamma-Al12Mg17 phase, and three laves phases at the
   Al2Mg composition were calculated at 0 K. Special quasi-random
   structures (SQS's) were used to mimic random fcc and hcp solution
   phases, and their enthalpies of mixing were predicted by
   first-principles calculations. The Al occupancy in the gamma-Al12Mg17
   phase is also studied by first-principles calculations, and the
   sublattice model (Mg)(5)(Al, Mg)(12)(Al, Mg)(12) was verified as the
   proper model to describe the gamma-Al12Mg17 phase. The complete
   thermodynamic description of the Al-Mg binary system was evaluated by
   this combined CALPHAD/first-principles calculations approach and was
   shown to be in a good agreement with experimental data with better
   defined energetics of solid phases than the previous modeling. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{The nature of the droplet size variation and its effect on the process
   behaviour were investigated for short circuit CO2 arc welding using a
   power supply with constant voltage output. To obtain the droplet images
   and record the welding current and voltage transient waveforms in phase,
   an integrated experimental system was established by combining a high
   speed charge coupled device camera based on laser shadowing and a
   related optical system with a dual channel analog/digital converter. The
   droplet size in short circuit transfer mode is defined as the maximum
   diameter of the molten droplet just before short circuiting. The
   experimental results reveal that the distribution of droplet size
   typically has a random nature with a range of between 1 and 2 times the
   electrode diameter. Excessively large or small droplet size is markedly
   unfavourable to the process stability. The droplet shape just before
   short circuiting and the short circuiting experience are also critical
   factors affecting the process behaviour. The main factors influencing
   the droplet size and shape are analysed in detail and approaches to
   control their evolution are then proposed.}},

Title = {{SitaRam: a computational approach for multi perspective visualization of
   higher-order and progressive patterns in highly repetitive regions of
   DNA}},
Journal = {{PERIODICUM BIOLOGORUM}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{107}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Highly repetitive DNA sequences localized in
   centromeric and telomeric regions of chromosomes have essential roles in
   cell division and aging, respectively. (Peri)centromeric and
   (sub)telomeric repetitive DNA sequences are poorly understood because
   they exhibit extreme complexity and polymorphism of sequence and
   organization at all levels and because they are not yet fully assembled.
   The objective of this word was to develop the 1-model for computational
   visualisation of universal features as well as the variability that
   characterize the architecture of these DNA regions directly from their
   primary sequence using a repeat-finding strategy combined with
   color-coding of sequence-relatedness. The main purpose was to provide
   detailed maps that would help in understanding the relationship between
   the primary sequence, organization, evolutionary history and function of
   repetitive DNA sequences in eukaryotic genomes.
   Materials and Methods: The proposed approach, named SitaRam, is based on
   application of BLAST (blastu and bl2seq), MapDraw, multicolor DotPlot,
   Clustal and Sfor methods. It was developed on AC017075 and AC019063 BAC
   clone sequences that encompass the centromere gap at the human
   chromosome 7.
   Results: SitaRain approach was found to be equally suitablcfor the
   visual analysis of ``new{''} and ``old{''} alpha-satellite DNA arrays.
   Provided here are graphic presentations of the discontinuous progressive
   pattern at the border of the centromeric D7Z1 array and presentations of
   the entire multimerically arranged D7Z2 array together with its
   monomerically arranged surrounding. Multicolor, multiscale and
   multiregister visualization of tandem repeat variants within satellite
   arrays in their sequential order revealed diverse hallmarks of unequal
   crossover as the process generating these arrays. By DotPlot merging, a
   difference in the frequency and distribution pattern of CENP-B boxes is
   revealed between alpha-satellite domains characterized by higher-order
   progressive and irregular monomeric organisation.
   Conclusions: The proposed representations are characterized by small
   space requirements and enable simultaneous visualization of diverse
   types of satellite and interspersed DNA sequences, their
   inverstigations.deletions and potential protein-binding sites. According
   to the appearance of repetitive patterns, satellite DNA arrays can be
   visually classified in to their evolutionary age, chromosomal location
   and function. Among the potentials of this model are the comparative
   analysis of repetitive DNA sequences originating from different
   eukaryotes and from diverse parts of their chromosomes, the evaluation
   of individual polymoiphism, the detection of as yet unidentified
   sequences, information compression and simplification of education on
   repetitive DNAs.}},

   means of the effective scattering cross section of the free volume. The
   quantitative relation between the scattering cross section and the
   resistance change is established, and from which the resistance

Abstract = {{Objectives: To investigate the effects of a 24-week program of upper-
   and lower-limb aerobic exercise training on walking performance in
   patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and to study
   the mechanisms that could influence symptomatic improvement.
   Methods: After approval from the North Sheffield Local Research Ethics
   Committee, 104 patients (median age, 69 years; range, 50 to 85 years)
   with stable PAD were randomized into an upper- or lower-limb aerobic
   exercise training group (UL-Ex or LL-Ex), or to a nonexercise training
   control group. Training was performed twice weekly for 24 weeks at
   equivalent relative exercise intensities. An incremental arm- and
   leg-crank test (ACT and LCT) to maximum exercise tolerance was performed
   before and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks of the intervention to determine
   peak oxygen consumption (VO2). Walking performance, defined as the
   claudicating distance (CD) and maximum walking distance (MWD) achieved
   before intolerable claudication pain, was assessed at the same time
   points by using a shuttle-walk protocol. Peak blood lactate
   concentration, Borg ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and pain
   category ratio (CR-10) were recorded during all assessments.
   Results. CD and MWD increased over time (P < .001) in both training
   groups. At 24 weeks, CD had improved by 51\% and 57\%, and MWD had
   improved by 29\% and 31\% (all P < .001) in the UL-Ex and LL-Ex groups,
   respectively. An increase in peak heart rate at MWD in the UL-Ex group
   (109 +/- 4 vs 115 4 beats/min; P +/- .01) and LL-Ex group (107 +/- 3 vs
   118 +/- 3 beats/min; P = .01) was accompanied by an increase in the
   amount of pain experienced in both groups (P < .05), suggesting that
   exercising patients could tolerate a higher level of cardiovascular
   stress and an increased intensity of claudication pain before test
   termination after training. Patients assigned to exercise training also
   showed an increase in LCT peak VO2 at the 24-week time point in relation
   to baseline (P < .01) and control patients (P < .01), whereas ACT peak
   VO2 was only improved in the UL-Ex group (P < .05).
   Conclusions. Our results suggest that a combination of physiologic
   adaptations and improved exercise pain tolerance account for the
   improvement in walking performance achieved through upper-limb aerobic
   exercise training in patients with PAD. Furthermore, that both arm- and
   leg-crank training could be useful exercise training modalities for
   improving cardiovascular function, walking performance, and exercise
   pain tolerance in patients with symptomatic PAD.}},

Abstract = {{A subpopulation of neurons in the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the rat
   retina were labeled 9-13 weeks after application of Fluorogold (FG) to
   the superior colliculus. Neurobiotin injection of FG-labeled cells in
   the INL of flatmounted living retina revealed that these cells consisted
   of both displaced ganglion cells and a subset of amacrine cells.
   Fluorogold-labeled amacrine cells in the INL showed tracer coupling to
   other presumptive amacrine cells in the INL, but there was no evidence
   of coupling to neurons in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). As the labeling
   of amacrine cells by FG may be due to gap junction coupling between
   ganglion and amacrine cells, these data add to the evidence that tracer
   coupling between these cells can be unidirectional. Some of the
   FG-labeled displaced ganglion cells in the INL injected with Neurobiotin
   also showed tracer coupling to neurons in the INL or GCL. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Interconnected by tight junctions, the epithelial cells of the choroid
   plexus form a barrier separating the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from
   blood. Using an in vitro model based on porcine choroid plexus
   epithelial cells (PCPEC), we investigated the influence of PKC
   activating phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on barrier properties
   and analyzed mechanisms involved :in the regulation of barrier
   tightness. Applied in concentrations of 5-25 nM, PMA induced a fast and
   lasting decrease of the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER),
   which could be blocked by rottlerin, indicating the involvement of PKC
   delta in signal transduction. The immediate impairment of barrier
   integrity was accompanied by dephosphorylation of occludin and formation
   of actin bundles. Moreover, in the presence of at least 25 nM PMA,
   changes of cell shape as well as discontinuities of tight junction
   strands were observed, suggesting the disruption of cell-cell contacts.
   Exposure to PMA for 1-2 days additionally induced down-regulation of
   claudin-2 and up-regulation of barrier modulating matrix
   metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, respectively. The results show that different
   interconnected mechanisms directly and indirectly targeting at the tight
   junctions are released by PMA contributing to the short-term and
   long-term decrease of TER and opening of the blood-CSF barrier in vitro.

Abstract = {{In a companion paper {[}P.R.J. Asveld, Fuzzy context-free languages-Part
   1: Generalized fuzzy context-free grammars, Theoret. Comput. Sci.
   (2005)] we used fuzzy context-free grammars in order to model
   grammatical errors resulting in erroneous inputs for robust recognizing
   and parsing algorithms for fuzzy context-free languages. In particular,
   this approach enables us to distinguish between small errors ({''}tiny
   mistakes{''}) and big errors ({''}capital blunders{''}).
   In this paper, we present some algorithms to recognize fuzzy
   context-free languages: particularly, a modification of
   Cocke-Younger-Kasami's algorithm and some recursive descent algorithms.
   Then we extend these recognition algorithms to corresponding parsing
   algorithms for fuzzy context-free languages. These parsing algorithms
   happen to be robust in some very elementary sense. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   Recombinant antibodies can be easily manipulated generating new ligand
   and effector activities that can be used as prototype magic bullets. On
   the other hand, an extensive knowledge of recombinant antibody binding
   and stability features are essential for an efficient substitution. In
   this study, we compared the stability and protein binding properties of
   two recombinant antibody fragments with their parental monoclonal
   antibody. The recombinant fragments were a monomeric scFv and a dimeric
   one, harboring human IgG1 CH2-CH3 domains. We have used fluorescence
   titration quenching to determine the thermodynamics of the interaction
   between an anti-Z-DNA monoclonal antibody and its recombinant antibody
   fragments with Z-DNA. All the antibody fragments seemed to bind DNA
   similarly, in peculiar two-affinity states. Enthalpy-entropy
   compensation was observed for both affinity states, but a marked entropy
   difference was observed for the monomeric scFv antibody fragment, mainly
   for the high affinity binding. In addition, we compared the stability of
   the dimeric antibody fragment and found differences favoring the
   monoclonal antibody. These differences seem to derive from the
   heterologous expression system used. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Large-scale Mesoproterozoic crustal shear zones are partially exposed
   from beneath cover sequences in the Christie Domain of the northwestern
   Gawler Craton, southern Australia. These structures are associated with
   gravity and magnetic anomalies that allow them to be mapped under cover,
   and their three-dimensional geometry and kinematics to be evaluated.
   Gravity and magnetic forward modelling indicate that these shear zones
   form an imbricate oblique thrust stack with combined
   top-to-the-southeast, left lateral transport. The longest shear zones in
   the stack penetrate the crust to at least 15 km depth, and dip to the
   northwest at 70 degrees; their inferred sense of motion are consistent
   with kinematic indicators from sparse outcrops. From northwest to
   southeast, the stack includes crustal slices bound by the Karari Fault
   Zone, Tallacootra and Blowout Shear Zones, Colona and Coorabie Fault
   Zones and the Muckanippie Shear Zone. These structures separate discrete
   tectonometamorphic packages within the previously undifferentiated
   Christie Gneiss of the Archean Mulgathing Complex, and imply several
   generations of transport of material from the lower and middle crust.
   Three-dimensional inversion of gravity data indicates that the
   Muckanippie Shear Zone, a shallowly rooted second-order splay of the
   Coorabie Fault Zone has an antithaic dip (to the southeast), and is part
   of a positive flower structure.
   Cross-cutting relationships, coupled with recent reconnaissance
   geochronology, suggest that the western Gawler Craton, part of the
   Mawson Continent, was under a long-lasting oblique slip deformational
   regime after ca. 1590 Ma. This tectonic reworking is correlated with
   episodic pervasive metamorphism and deformation recorded elsewhere in
   the Gawler Craton between ca. 1550 and 1450 (Coorabie Orogeny), pointing
   to a complex history of stabilization in Proterozoic Rodinia.
   The Tallacootra, Colona and Coorabie structures are all cut at a high
   angle to their strikes by Mesozoic rift faults of the Southern Rift
   System, and may form piercing points in reconstructions of Gondwana, and
   earlier Rodinia configurations. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by

Abstract = {{Poly (N-(hydroxymethyl) methacrylamide-1-allyl-2-thiourea) hydrogels,
   poly(NHMMA-ATU), which have highly open pore size and high swellability,
   were synthesized by gamma irradiation using Co-60-gamma source at
   different radiation dose rates and in different 1-allyl-2-thiourea
   content in the ternary mixture of NHMMA-ATU-H2O. These hydrogels were
   used for specific platinum and palladium selectivity, recovery and
   pre-concentration from single and competitive media. It was observed
   that platinum and palladium adsorption capacities onto the hydrogels
   were also high at low pHs. Adsorption capacity of the hydrogels for
   platinum and palladium ions in acidic media around pH 0.5 were found to
   be about 477 and 407 mg g(-1) dry hydrogels for Pt(II) and Pd(II).
   Adsorption of platinum and palladium ions onto the hydrogels was found
   to be very fast and also these hydrogels were showed extremely high
   selectivity to the platinum and palladium ions at pH 0.5 beside the
   extremely high concentration of the other transition and toxic metal
   ions. All matrix effects were easily eliminated adsorbing platinum and
   palladium ions onto the hydrogels at around pH 0.5 and desorbing into
   3.0 M HCl solution containing 0.8 M thiourea because of the high
   specificity of these hydrogels to precious metal ions although the
   existing of the other metal ions at high concentration and at low pHs.
   Different amount of platinum spiked geological samples were analyzed for
   the method validation after discovered method applied and it was found
   that recovery of platinum was not less than 96.8\%. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   containing a sulfonated poly{[}(hydroxy)propyl, phenyl]ether (SPHPE),
   with empirical formula
   {[}-O-Ar-C(Me)(2)-Ar(SO3H)(0.4)-O-CH2CH(OH)-CH2-(center dot)1.5 H2O](n),
   and poly(dipropyl)phosphazene (PDPrP) to yield a film which was soaked
   in 85\% H3PO4 (PA) and dried. The final SPHPE-PDPrP-PA film (0.15 cm
   thick) contained -SO3H functional groups and H3PO4 at 0.16 SO3H/N and
   1.72 H3P04/N mole ratios. For the phosphazene polymer, at least two
   types of repeating units were present, i.e., -P(CH2CH2CH3)(2)=N- and
   -P(CH2CH2CH3)(2)=NH+(H2PO4-center dot H3PO4)- at 0.18 N/NH+ mole ratio.
   This material exhibited proton conductivity (sigma, Omega(-1) cm(-1)) of
   2.27 10(-4) -7.10 10(-3) at 24 - 127 degrees C in dry environment, and
   of 4.79 10(-4)-1.54 10(-3) at 45-65 degrees C and 11\% relative

Abstract = {{Tetra (p-sulfonato-phenyl) porphyrin rhodium hydride
   ({[}(TSPF)Rh-D(D2O)](-4)) (1) reacts in water (D2O) with carbon
   monoxide, aldehydes, and olefins to produce metallo formyl,
   alpha-hydroxyalkyl, and alkyl complexes, respectively. The hydride
   complex (1) functions as a weak acid in D2O and partially dissociates
   into a rhodium(I) complex ({[}(TSPP)Rh-1(D2O)](-5)) and a proton (D+).
   Fast substrate reactions of 1 in D2O compared to reactions of rhodium
   porphyrin hydricle ((por)Rh-H) in benzene are ascribed to aqueous media
   promoting formation of ions and supporting ionic reaction pathways. The
   regioselectivity for addition of 1 to olefins is predominantly
   anti-Markovnikov in acidic D2O and exclusively anti-Markovnikov in basic
   D2O. The range of accessible equilibrium thermodynamic measurements for
   rhodium hydride substrate reactions is substantially increased in water
   compared to that in organic media through exploiting the hydrogen ion
   dependence for the equilibrium distribution of species in aqueous media.
   Thermodynamic measurements are reported for reactions of a rhodium
   porphyrin hydricle in water with each of the substrates, including CO,
   H2CO, CH3CHO, CH2=CH2, and sets of aldehydes and olefins. Reactions of
   rhodium porphyrin hydrides with CO and aldehydes have nearly equal
   free-energy changes in water and benzene, but alkene reactions that form
   hydrophobic alkyl groups are substantially less favorable in water than
   in benzene. Bond dissociation free energies in water are derived from
   thermodynamic results for (TSPP)Rh-organo complexes in aqueous solution
   for Rh-CDO, Rh-CH(R)OD, and Rh-CH2CH(D)R units and are compared with
   related values determined in benzene.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a new approach to the dynamic motion planning
   problems of mobile robots in uncertain dynamic environments based on the
   behavior dynamics from a control point of view. The fundamental behavior
   of a mobile robot in motion planning is regarded as a dynamic process of
   the interaction between the robot and its local environment, and then it
   is modeled and controlled for the motion-planning purpose. Based on
   behavior dynamics, the dynamic motion-planning problem of mobile robots
   is transformed into a control problem of the integrated
   planning-and-control system. And the dynamic motion-planning problem can
   be transformed into a conventional optimization problem in the robot's
   acceleration space. Realization of the collision-avoidance behavior is
   shown to be just a control problem of the robot's acceleration. The
   proposed method can directly provide the desired acceleration for mobile
   robots. No restrictions are assumed on the shape and trajectories of
   obstacles. No local minima are encountered in most cases. Collision
   avoidance between multiple mobile robots can also be realized. Stability
   of the whole planning-and-control system can be guaranteed. Out method
   provides a new insight to the motion-planning problem of mobile robots
   based on behavior dynamics and from the control point of view.

   prepared as bimodal extrudates, containing 11-20\% of total pore volume

   containing carbon black and macropores, showed good side crushing
   strength (0.67-1.19 kg/mm) after pyrolysis in 6\% O-2/N-2.
   AMAC-catalysts were obtained after impregnating these alumina-carbon
   black supports with Ni and Mo, to obtain 3.5 wt.\% NiO and 15 Wt-\%

   showed much fewer sediments and less Conradson carbon formation. Initial
   HDS in AMAC containing macropores can be as high as 92\%, while that in

Abstract = {{The effect of shear on dewatering behaviour and particle interactions of
   Na-exchanged smectite and kaolinite clay dispersions has been
   investigated at pH 7.5, using hydrolysable Ca(II) and Mn(II) ions as
   coagulants and high molecular weight anionic and non-ionic
   polyacrylamide (PAM A and PAM N, respectively) and polyethylene oxide
   (PEO) flocculants. Metal ion addition enhanced the flocculation
   performance by dramatically reducing the magnitude of the particle zeta
   potential and, in the case of smectite pulp, suppressing osmotic
   swelling. Under optimum orthokinetic flocculation conditions of
   controlled agitation rate and duration, PAM A and PEO-based floes
   settled faster than those of PAM N whilst kaolinite pulps produced
   higher sedimentation rates than smectite pulps. The settling rates are
   nearly an order of magnitude greater than those observed under standard
   flocculant-pulp mixing/flocculation methods of inversion and plunging.
   The difference in the flocculant behaviour is attributed to the more
   expanded conformation of PAM A and PEO polymer chains in contrast to PAM
   N, whilst the lower yield stresses, reflecting inter-particle bridging
   and floe network structure strength that are conducive to faster
   clarification, were displayed by kaolinite pulps. Following shear,
   similar consolidation enhancement of approximate to 5-7 wt.\% solid for
   both pulps was achieved at an optimum agitation range of 100-200 rpm.
   This was accompanied by decreased yield stress in the case of PAM
   A-based pulps, indicating non-reversible disruption of polymer mediated
   particle and floe network structure. In contrast, the yield stresses of
   PAM N and PEO flocculated dispersions indicated similar and stronger
   particle interactions, respectively, upon consolidation following shear.

Abstract = {{In the present study, we investigate the combined effect of polymer
   additives and active blowing and suction at the wall on drag reduction
   using direct numerical simulation. Three different turbulent channel
   flows having the same bulk Reynolds number but different wall shear
   velocities are generated to see the role of the strength of near-wall
   streamwise vortices in polymer drag reduction. From this study, we show
   that the phenomenon of polymer drag reduction is closely related to the
   strength of near-wall streamwise vortices as well as the elasticity of
   polymer solution. On the other hand, the combined drag reduction
   obtained by both the polymer additives and the blowing and suction is
   larger than the individual drag reduction either by polymers or by
   blowing and suction, but is smaller than sum of the two separate drag
   reductions, indicating that the polymer solution is less efficient in
   producing drag reduction in the absence of strong near-wall streamwise
   vortices. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Partially molten regions in the lowermost mantle have been inferred to
   exist by the discovery of the ultralow velocity zone (ULVZ). We consider
   a small-scale stagnant-lid convection in the D{''} layer, following
   {[}Solomatov, V.S., Moresi, L.N., 2002. Small-scale convection in the W
   layer. J. Geophys. Res., 107, doi: 10.1029/2000JB000063.], to
   investigate the relationship between partial melt and seismic
   anisotropies often found in the W layer. Such convection can bring melts
   in the W layer from the ULVZ, deform the melt inclusions, and
   accordingly would profoundly affect seismic structures including
   anisotropies. We therefore calculate the deformation history of
   partially molten regions at the base of the W layer which is heated from
   below, using a 2D model with a strongly temperature dependent viscosity.
   An initially isotropic partial melt is strongly deformed by the viscous
   stress caused by thermal convection, and becomes anisotropic by shape
   preferred orientation (SPO) of melt inclusions, whose aspect ratios are
   of the order of 10(1) to 10(2) at the base of the plume and become as
   large as 103 to 104 in the plume head. We calculate the effective
   elastic constants for such anisotropic media which contain deformed melt
   inclusions, and obtain the seismic velocity for a horizontal ray path.
   We find that the horizontally averaged velocity profile can be
   correlated with convective patterns. If melting occurs not only in the
   ULVZ but extends to the top of hot regions of the W layer, the vertical
   seismic profile consists of three layers corresponding to the base,
   conduit and head of a rising plume. The lowermost layer, which
   corresponds to the ULVZ, becomes strongly anisotropic with V-SH > V-SV.
   The deformation and alignment of the melt, rather than the melting
   itself, is primarily responsible for reducing the seismic velocity. On
   the other hand, in the conduit, the anisotropy is of V-SV > V-SH type
   because of vertical alignment. In the plume head, the anisotropy is of
   V-SH > V-SV type with a magnitude of about 2\%. We discuss how shear
   wave anisotropy may be used to infer the temporal evolution of the W
   layer. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   solved using block preconditioners with GMRES solver. In order to

   total dietary antioxidant intake. In the European Prospective
   Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort of Ragusa (Sicily), a
   high number of subjects were found to frequently eat wild greens,
   including Sinapis incana and Sinapis nigra, Diplotaxis erucoides,
   Cichorium intybus, Asparagus acutifolius, and Borrago officinalis. On
   the basis of these observations, detailed characterization of single
   antioxidant components (i.e., polyphenols, carotenoids, chlorophylls,
   and ascorbic acid) and the TAC of these edible wild traditional plants
   was performed. The wild plants examined were found to be very rich in
   antioxidants, such as flavonoids and carotenoids, with high TAC values,
   suggesting that the importance of these vegetables, not only in the
   traditional but even in the contemporary diet, needs to be emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{Soil water repellency (hydrophobicity) is a naturally occurring
   phenomenon that can be intensified by soil heating during fires.
   Fire-induced water repellency, together with the loss of plant cover, is
   reportedly the principal source of increased surface runoff and
   accelerated erosion in burned soils.
   In this study, the surface water repellency of several soils affected by
   summer forest fires in northwest Spain was studied and compared with
   that of adjacent unburned soils. Soil water repellency was determined
   using the ethanol percentage test (MED).
   Most of the unburned soil samples exhibited water repellency that ranged
   from strong to very strong; only four of the unburned soil samples were
   non-repellent. Water repellency in the unburned soils was significantly
   correlated with the organic carbon content (r = 0.64, p < 0.05).
   Overall, fires increased the surface water repellency in soils with
   previously low degrees of water repellency and caused little change in
   that of originally strongly hydrophobic soils.
   In order to examine in detail the changes in water repellency with
   temperature, three unburned soil samples were subjected to a controlled
   heating program. Water repellency increased between 25 and 220 degrees
   C, water repellency peaked between 220 and 240 degrees C and disappeared
   above 260-280 degrees C. Extrapolation of the results of the heating
   tests to field conditions suggested that the intensity of fire
   (temperature and time of residence) reached by most soils during fires
   is not too high. Based on the results, the determination of water
   repellency could be used as a simple test for the indirect estimation of
   the intensity levels reached on the soil surface during a fire.

Abstract = {{one of the well characterized cell biologic actions of lithium is the
   inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta and the consequent
   activation of canonical Wnt signaling. Because deficient Wnt signaling
   has been implicated in disorders of reduced bone mass, we tested whether
   lithium could improve bone mass in mice. We gavage-fed lithium chloride
   to 8-week-old mice from three different strains (Lrp5(-/-), SAMP6, and
   C57BL/6) and assessed the effect on bone metabolism after 4 weeks of
   therapy. Lrp5(-/-) mice lack the Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein
   receptor-related protein 5 and have markedly reduced bone mass. Lithium,
   which is predicted to act downstream of this receptor, restored bone
   metabolism and bone mass to near wild-type levels in these mice. SAMP6
   mice have accelerated osteoporosis due to inadequate osteoblast renewal.
   Lithium significantly improved bone mass in these mice and in wild-type
   C57BL/6 mice. We found that lithium activated canonical Wnt signaling in
   cultured calvarial osteoblasts from Lrp5(-/-) mice ex vivo and that
   lithium-treated mice had increased expression of Wnt-responsive genes in
   their bone marrow cells in vivo. These data lead us to conclude that
   lithium enhances bone formation and improves bone mass in mice and that
   it may do so via activation of the canonical Writ pathway. Lithium has
   been used safely and effectively for over half a century in the
   treatment of bipolar illness. Prospective studies in patients receiving
   lithium should determine whether it also improves bone mass in humans.}},

   allow to correctly describe both the L-3 and L-2 manifold of Ti 2p core
   excited states. Different XC potential have been used in the
   calculations showing that the results are not very sensitive to the
   exchange correlation potential choice, provided the asymptotic behaviour
   is correct. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to construct a high-performance microreactor for conducting
   heterogeneous catalytic reactions, one must prepare a porous catalytic
   wall with high surface area on the microchannel. In this Study, with the
   purpose of preparing Such a catalyzed wall, microchannels plated with
   copper-based components by electroless plating were prepared on the
   inner walls of aluminum tubes with micron-order diameter. The
   electroless plating consisted of an activation of the inner walls of
   aluminum tubes by hydrogen chloride solution, a displacement plating of
   zinc, an intermediate plating of iron, and chemical reduction plating of
   copper. Each process solution was flowed into the aluminum tube by a
   suction pump system. The physicochemical properties and the steam
   reforming properties of methanol for the plated channel were then
   investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of the
   surface and section of the plated wall showed that the preparation used
   in this study produced catalytic components with a film thickness of
   about 100 mu m that were deposited porously on the inner surfaces of
   microtubes. An elemental analysis indicated that the plated walls
   consisted of copper and zinc, with the latter being detected in a wide
   area from the bulk to the surface of the wall. The microtube-type
   copper-based catalyst oxidized by air was significantly higher in
   activity of methanol reforming than that reduced by 9 hydrogen,
   indicating that the conversion was 100\% and the hydrogen production was
   about 0.07 mol/h at 160 degrees C with the channel length of 450 mm.
   Even after the activity of the oxidized catalyst declined, its initial
   activity could be restored by reoxidation. The activity restoration by
   reoxiclation could be repeated. These results show that the
   microtube-type catalysts prepared in this study have high catalytic
   performance for microreformer. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Ba1-xSrxTiO3 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) nanocrystalline powders
   were prepared by mechanosynthesis in a planetary mill, from
   stoichiometric mixtures of BaO2, SrO, and TiO2 at room temperature.
   Evolution during the mechanical treatment and subsequent annealings was
   investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (HRTEM). Formation of the solid solution between
   BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 was observed in the whole range of compositions. The
   spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique was used to prepare dense
   ceramics. Densification occurred within a very short time (about 10
   min). The combination of mechanosynthesis and spark plasma sintering has
   been used for the first time to process ceramics of the Ba-Sr-Ti-O
   system with very high density and homogeneous microstructure, at a
   temperature 300-400 degrees C lower than the conventional sintering of
   Ba1-xSrTiO3 phases obtained by solid-state reaction. This approach
   allows grain growth to be controlled and opens the possibility of
   processing fully dense nanostructured Ba1-xSrTiO3 ceramics. Dielectric
   permittivity as a function of temperature was characterized for a series
   of samples across the solid solution and confirmed that dense,
   fine-grained ceramics can be processed by this novel approach for all
   compositions. Ferroelecyric hysteresis loops were recorded for BaTiO3
   ceramics with decreasing grain size. The variations of remanent
   polarization and coercitive field are consistent with the transition
   from the lamellar 90 degrees ferroelectric domain to grains with only
   180 degrees domains.}},

Abstract = {{The classical Monod-Wyman-Changeux model for homogeneous allosteric
   protein complex is generalized in this article to model the responses of
   heterogeneous receptor complexes to multiple types of ligand stimulus.
   We show that the recent in vivo experimental data of Escherichia coli
   chemotaxis responses for mutant strains with different expression levels
   of the chemo-receptors to different types of stimulus {[}Sourjik, V. \&
   Berg, H. C. (2004) Nature 428, 437-441] all can be explained
   consistently within this generalized Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. Based
   on the model and the existing data, responses of all of the strains
   (studied in this article) to the presence of any combinations of ligand
   (Ser and MeAsp) concentrations are predicted quantitatively for future
   experimental verification. Through modeling the in vivo response data,
   our study reveals important information about the properties of
   different types of individual receptors, as well as the composition of
   the cluster. The energetic contribution of the nonligand binding,
   cytoplasmic parts of the cluster, such as CheA and CheW, is also
   discussed. The generalized allosteric model provides a consistent
   framework in understanding signal integration and differentiation in
   bacterial chemotaxis. it should also be useful for studying the

Abstract = {{Current methodologies that monitor immune responses rely on invasive
   techniques that sample tissues at a given point in time. New
   technologies are needed to elucidate the temporal patterns of immune
   responses and the spatial distribution of immune cells on a whole-body
   scale. We describe a noninvasive, quantitative, and tomographic approach
   to visualize a primary anti-tumor immune response by using positron
   emission tomography (PET). Bone marrow chimeric mice were generated by
   engraftment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with a
   trifusion reporter gene encoding synthetic Renilla luciferase (hRluc),
   EGFP, and Herpes virus thymidine kinase (sr39TK). Mice were challenged
   with the Moloney murine sarcoma and leukemia virus complex
   (M-MSV/M-MuLV), and the induced immune response was monitored by using
   PET. Hematopoietic cells were visualized by using
   9-{[}4-{[}F-18]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine ({[}F-18]FHBG), a
   radioactive substrate specific for the sr39TK PET reporter protein.
   immune cell localization and expansion were seen at the tumor and
   draining lymph nodes (DLNs). 2-{[}F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
   ({[}F-18]FDG), which is sequestered in metabolically active cells, was
   used to follow tumor growth and regression. Elevated glucose metabolism
   was also seen in activated lymphocytes in the DLNs by using the
   {[}F-18]FDG probe. When M-MSV/M-MuLV-challenged mice were treated with
   the immunosuppressive drug dexamethasone, activation and expansion of
   immune cell populations in the DLNs could no longer be detected with PET
   imaging. The method we describe can be used to kinetically measure the
   induction and therapeutic modulations of cell-mediated immune responses.}},

   derivative of an ion-exchangeable layered perovskite, HLaNb2O7 center
   dot xH(2)O (HLaNb) or HCa2Nb3O10 center dot xH(2)O (HCaNb),
   silanol-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), and tetramethoxysilane
   (TMOS) via a sol-gel process involving the reaction of the n-decoxy
   derivative with a PDMS-TMOS mixture and subsequent intentional
   hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
   of the resultant products after intentional hydrolysis indicate both
   preservation of the perovskite-like slab structure and disappearance of
   stacking order. Partial exfoliation of layered perovskites is
   correspondingly observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The
   formation of a polysiloxane network composed of PDMS chains and Q(n)
   units ((RO)(4-n)Si(OSi)(n): R = H, CH3) via intentional hydrolysis is
   shown by the solid-state Si-29 CP/MAS (cross-polarization and magic
   angle spinning) NMR spectroscopy. These products are expected to possess
   the Nb-O-Si linkage interface since a signal assignable to the
   (SiO)Si(CH3)(2)O-Nb environment is present in the Si-29 CP/MAS NMR
   spectra of products prepared from an n-decoxy derivative of HLaNb (or
   HCaNb), PDMS, and TMOS in a similar manner without intentional
   hydrolysis and the Nb-O-Si bonds are expected to be preserved during
   hydrolysis. The exfoliated structures should be formed during the
   intentional hydrolysis process since the products prepared without
   intentional hydrolysis clearly exhibit a stacking order along the c
   axis.}},

   constraint is enforced by employing the integral form of the mass
   conservation equation in deformed configurations of the body. A
   Mooney-Rivlin incompressible material model is used for material
   description. A collocated variable arrangement is used and the spatial
   domain is discretized using finite volumes of an arbitrary polyhedral
   shape. A segregated approach is employed to solve resulting set of
   coupled non-linear algebraic equations, utilizing a SIMPLE based
   algorithm for displacement-pressure coupling. Comparisons of numerical
   and analytical results show a very good agreement. For the limited range
   of cell topologies tested the developed method appears to be locking

Abstract = {{The present work reports the analyses of the experimental differential
   cross-sections of a elastic scattering on Ni-58,Ni-60,Ni-62,Ni-64, over
   a wide range of incident energies, in terms of four types of optical
   potentials, namely shallow (molecular), deep non-monotonic, squared
   Woods-Saxon and semi - microscopic folding. All the four potentials
   produce a reasonable description of the experimental data. The potential
   parameters, calculated from the energy density functional theory using a
   realistic two-nucleon interaction, resemble closely the molecular
   potential parameters, which produce the best description of the
   experimental data for the four isotopes. The volume integrals and the
   energy variation of the parameters indicate the effect of the
   shell-model structure on the potentials. The folding potentials, without
   any need for renormalization, are found to describe reasonably well the
   elastic scattering cross-section data for the four isotopes within the
   energy range considered. In conformity with the previous observation on
   Ca isotopes, the number of nucleons, 4A(alpha) = 49, existing in a-like
   clusters in the target nucleus, is the same for the four isotopes,
   considered herein. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Many applications of porous carbons demand control of pore size and its
   distribution. One of the most promising ways to mass-produce carbon with
   the desired porosity is by etching of non-carbon species from inorganic
   carbon containing materials, such as metal carbides. In this work,
   carbon was synthesized from zirconium carbide, ZrC0.98, in a chlorine
   environment in the temperature range of 200-1200 degrees C.
   Thermodynamic simulation shows the possibility of carbon formation in a
   broad range of temperature. The structure of the resultant carbon
   analyzed using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), shows that ordering of carbon
   took place with increase in synthesis temperature. Porosity analyzed
   using gas sorption technique shows that carbon produced at low
   temperature (300-600 degrees C) has small pores with narrow pore size
   distribution; whereas carbon produced at high temperature (800-1200
   degrees C) has large pores with wider pore size distribution. In
   comparison with other carbide derived carbons, B4C and Ti3SiC2, whose
   pore size and its distribution do not change appreciably in 200-1000
   degrees C range; carbon produced from ZrC can have both narrowly
   distributed micropores and mesopores depending upon the temperature of
   synthesis. As in carbons produced from other carbides, both the
   structure and porosity were found to depend on the synthesis
   temperature. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To introduce a computer-aided morphometric method for quantifying
   the necro-inflammatory phase in liver biopsy specimens using fractal
   geometry and Delaunay's triangulation.
   METHODS: Two-micrometer thick biopsy sections taken from 78 chronic
   hepatitis C virus-infected patients were immunohistochemically treated
   to identify the inflammatory cells. An automatic computer-aided image
   analysis system was used to define the inflammatory cell network defined
   on the basis of Delaunay's triangulation, and the inflammatory cells
   were geometrically classified as forming a cluster (an aggregation of a
   minimum of three cells) or as being irregularly distributed within the
   tissue. The phase of inflammatory activity was estimated using Hurst's
   exponent.
   RESULTS: The proposed automatic method was rapid and objective. It could
   not only provide rigorous results expressed by scalar numbers, but also
   allow the state of the whole organ to be represented by Hurst's exponent
   with an error of no more than 12\%.
   CONCLUSION: The availability of rigorous metrical measures and the
   reasonable representativeness of the status of the organ as a whole
   raise the question as to whether the indication for hepatic biopsy
   should be revised by establishing clear rules concerning the
   contraindications suggested by its invasiveness and subjective
   interpretation. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Insomnia is common and debilitating to fibromyalgia (FM)
   patients. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for many types
   of patients with insomnia, but has yet to be tested with FM patients.
   This study compared CBT with an alternate behavioral therapy and usual
   care for improving sleep and other FM symptoms.
   Methods: This randomized clinical trial enrolled 47 FM patients with
   chronic insomnia complaints. The study compared CBT, sleep hygiene (SH)
   instructions, and usual FM care alone. Outcome measures were subjective
   (sleep logs) and objective (actigraphy) total sleep time, sleep
   efficiency, total wake time, sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset,
   and questionnaire measures of global insomnia symptoms, pain, mood, and
   quality of life.
   Results: Forty-two patients completed baseline and continued into
   treatment. Sleep logs showed CBT-treated patients achieved nearly a 50\%
   reduction in their nocturnal wake time by study completion, whereas SH
   therapy-and usual care-treated patients achieved only 20\% and 3.5\%
   reductions on this measure, respectively. In addition, 8 (57\%) of 14
   CBT recipients met strict subjective sleep improvement criteria by the
   end of treatment compared with 2 (17\%) of 12 SH therapy recipients and
   0\% of the usual care group. Comparable findings were noted for similar
   actigraphic improvement criteria. The SH therapy patients showed
   favorable outcomes on measures of pain and mental well-being. This
   finding was most notable in an SH therapy subgroup that self-elected to
   implement selected CBT strategies.
   Conclusions: Cognitive-behavioral therapy represents a promising

   impact on atomic hydrogen in the 1-1000 keV impact energy range are

Abstract = {{The formation of molecular network, related to the consumption of
   unsaturated carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) during oxidative drying of
   alkyd coating films incorporating unsaturated fatty acids was Studied.
   The concentration of C=C bonds was measured as a function of drying time
   and distance from the exposed film surface (depth) using confocal Raman
   microspectroscopy (CRM). The change in spatial distribution of the C=C
   double bond concentration across the film cross section provides
   information on the kinetics of the oxidative cross-linking process in
   the alkyd films. It was found that the C=C bond consumption is not
   homogeneous across the depth of the drying film. The results obtained
   allowed us to quantitatively monitor the progress of the drying process
   and the movement of the `drying front' within the coating films. The
   drying profiles suggest that oxygen penetration into the coating film is
   a rate-limiting factor in the drying process. Depth profiles during the
   film forming process develop due to local variations in the oxygen
   solubility, diffusion coefficient of oxygen, and available amount of
   double bonds for cross-linking. The influence of several industrially
   relevant factors, like oil length of the alkyd resin, thickener,
   solvent, and drier on the film formation process is discussed. Depth
   resolution of the analytical approach and spatial accuracy of confocal
   Raman microspectroscopy are also treated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Network microstructures of poly(acrylamide)(PAAm) and
   poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) hydrogels were compared by static
   light scattering and elasticity measurements. The hydrogels were
   prepared by free-radicals crosslinking copolyymerization of the monomers
   acrylamide (AAm) or N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) with
   N,N'-methylemebis(acrylamide) as a crosslinker. During the formation of
   PAAm gels, both a maximum and a minimum were observed, corresponding to
   the chain overlap threshold and the gel point, respectively. This
   difference in the time-course between the two gelling systems is due to
   the late onset of gelation in the DMA system with respect to the
   critical overlap concentrations. Compared to the AAm system, no
   significant scattered light intensity rise was observed during the
   crosslinking polymerization of DMA. It was shown that, regardless of the
   crosslinker ratio and of the initial manomer concentration, PDMA gel is
   much more homogeneous that the corresponding PAAm gel due to the shift
   of the gelation threshold to the semidilute regime of the reaction
   system. The results suggest that the spatial gel inhomogeneity can be
   controlled by varing the gel point with respect to the critical overlap
   concentration during the preparation of gels by free-radical mechanisms.

Abstract = {{The fields of two linearly-polarized, co-propagated laser beams
   differing slightly in frequency are modelled by those of a tightly
   focused Gaussian beam. When a single electron is injected sideways into
   or near the common focus of the two beams, it gets captured and
   violently accelerated, reaching a maximum energy gain in excess of 2 GeV
   from beams of present-day power. Our simulations show that acceleration
   takes place typically over a fraction of a millimeter and that a maximum
   energy gradient of over 12 TeV m(-1) may be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels with good mechanical stability are generally obtained by
   chemical crosslinking. However, the compounds used as crosslinking
   agents are often highly toxic, and thus they are not recommended as
   starting materials in view of an environmentally safe production process
   and a biocompatible product.
   In this work chemically crosslinked superabsorbent hydrogels have been
   synthesized from water solutions of hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC),
   carboxymethylcellulose sodium Salt (CMCNa) and hyaluronic acid (HA),
   using a non-toxic water-soluble carbodiimide (WSC) as crosslinking
   agent. Sorption capacity both in water and in water solutions at
   different ionic strength has been investigated, taking into account the
   effect of different chemical compositions. Moreover, unaxial compression
   tests and dynamic-mechanical measurements on water swollen samples have
   been performed to probe the elastically effective degree of crosslinking
   of the polymeric network.
   In vivo tests on humans for the application of this material as a
   bulking agent in dietary regimes are in process and preliminary results
   are encouraging. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report the reversible change in the nonlinear conductance of a
   multiwall carbon nanotube (MWNT) when it is bent longitudinally. As the
   nanotube is compressed and bent, its resistance decreases dramatically.
   This behavior is fully recoverable. The observed drop in resistance
   during bending must be the result of increasing number of conduction
   channels in the nanotube and parallel transport through them. Using this
   concept of parallel transport, we show that it is indeed possible to
   electrically model the behavior of the MWNT under compression. The
   reversible electrical characteristics of a MWNT under bending opens new
   possibilities for these structures to be applied as nanoscale
   displacement sensors. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

   waters, from the formation of intermolecular O-H..... O hydrogen bonds,
   have been shown to self-assemble into an ``acyclic water trimer{''} in

   studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and fluorescence
   spectroscopy adopting guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) and urea as
   denaturant. The thermodynamic parameters of thermal and chemical
   denaturation were determined for bIgG using both methods. The
   experimental results of DSC and fluorescence spectroscopy showed that
   the thermal denaturation and thermal chemical denaturation of bIgG were
   both a complex irreversible process, and might follow a three-state
   mechanism. Isothermal chemical denaturation studies of bIgG were carried
   out in the presence of GuHCl or urea to observe that denaturant induced
   isothermal chemical denaturation of bIgG also followed a multistate
   process. The thermal denaturation measured in the presence of the
   denaturant displayed that the transition temperature and enthalpy change
   on denaturation of bIgG strongly depended on denaturant concentration,
   and GuHCl and urea interacted with bIgG primarily by hydrogen bonds,
   yielding a randomly coiled conformation in its unfolded state, while
   thermal denaturation produced an incompletely unfolded aggregation of
   bIgG. Therefore, both chemical denaturation methods can yield different
   structurally unfolded states of the bIgG.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological networks are quantitative, graph-based descriptions of
   ecosystems, consisting of compartments (trophospecies and nutrient
   pools) that exchange fluxes of nutrients or energy. Previous research
   pointed out how the model's design is a crucial task that can heavily
   influence analyses results, and how merging compartments for the purpose
   of comparing two or more different ecosystems can significantly alter
   the indices on which the comparison is based. All these works have been
   focused on the aggregation of trophospecies, whereas networks may
   comprise several nutrient compartments that may be lumped as well,
   either for lack of information or for comparison constraints.
   We show how the aggregation of these non-living compartments can have a
   greater influence on network analysis results than trophospecies
   clustering. This problem should on the one hand encourage modelers to
   make an effort to test the possible effects of aggregations, and on the
   other show how the role of non-living compartments could be very
   important in determining network dynamics. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Pterocarpus angolensis is a hardwood species subject to heavy
   exploitation throughout miombo woodlands of south-central Africa. Rates
   of natural recruitment measured in western Tanzania were found to be
   low, with only a third of parent trees generating any seedlings despite
   considerable seed production. Although heavily protected areas supported
   large parent trees, these adults had very few seedlings of > 5 cm DBH
   nearby, possibly suggesting mortality caused by high densities of
   browsing ungulates. Outside these well protected areas, cutting has
   removed most large trees and remaining adults are small producing
   relatively few seeds. Factors affecting recruitment include location and
   elevation perhaps indicative of higher precipitation, whereas short
   grass and reduced parent canopy cover are associated with more seedlings
   suggesting competition for light. Given these recruitment rates, the
   prognosis for sustainable exploitation of P. angolensis looks bleak. (c)

Abstract = {{Glutathione deficiency is an early biochemical feature that occurs
   during apoptotic neuronal death associated with certain neurological
   disorders such as Parkinson disease. However, whether specific targeting
   of glutathione biosynthesis in neurons is sufficient to trigger
   neurodegeneration remains undetermined. To address this issue, we used a
   vector-based small hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy to knock down each
   subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL; gamma-glutamylcysteine
   synthetase), the heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting
   step of glutathione biosynthesis. Independent targeting of the catalytic
   and modulatory subunits by shRNA caused disruption of GCL as assessed by
   Northern and Western blotting, enzyme activity, and glutathione
   concentrations. Silencing each subunit in primary cortical neurons
   spontaneously elicited time-dependent apoptotic death, an effect that
   was synergistic with glutamate or nitric oxide treatment. Moreover,
   neuronal apoptosis by GCL knockdown was rescued by expressing the
   corresponding subunit full-length cDNA carrying silent mutations within
   the shRNA target cDNA sequence and by incubating neurons with
   gamma-glutamylcysteine or glutathione ethyl ester. In contrast,
   supplying glutathione precursors to neurons from co-cultured astrocytes
   did not prevent the apoptotic death triggered by GCL knockdown. Finally,
   overexpressing the catalytic (but not modulatory) GCL subunit
   full-length cDNA increased enzyme activity and glutathione
   concentrations, yielding neurons more resistant to glutamate- or nitric
   oxide-mediated apoptosis. Thus, specific and independent disruption of
   each subunit of GCL in neurons can be said to cause a primary decrease
   in glutathione that is sufficient to promote neurodegeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic DNA analysis is routinely performed using polymorphic short
   tandem repeat (STR) markers. However, for degraded or minute DNA
   samples, analysis of autosomal single nuclectide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
   short fragments might be more successful. Furthermore, sequencing of
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is often performed on highly degraded or
   scarce samples due to the high copy number of mtDNA in each cell. Due to
   the increasing number of complete mtDNA genome sequences available, the
   limited discrimination power of an mtDNA analysis, may be increased by
   analysis of coding region polymorphisms in addition to the non-coding
   variation. Since sequence analysis of the coding region would require
   more material than generally present in forensic samples, an alternative
   SNP analysis approach is required. We have developed a one-colour
   microarray-based SNP detection system for limited forensic materials.
   The method is based on minisequencing in solution prior to hybridisation
   to universal tag-arrays. In a first outline of a forensic chip, a
   combination of 12 nuclear and 21 mitochondrial SNP markers are analysed
   simultaneously. The mitochondrial markers on the chip are polymorphisms
   within the hypervariable region as well as in the coding region. Even
   though the number of markers in the current system is limited, it can
   easily be extended to yield a greater power of discrimination. When
   fully developed, microarray analysis provides a promising system for
   efficient sensitive SNP analysis of forensic samples in the future. (c)

Abstract = {{The prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in free-ranging chickens is a good
   indicator of the prevalence of T. gondii oocysts in the soil because
   chickens feed from the ground. The prevalence of T. gondii in 77
   free-range chickens (Gallus domesticus) from Colombia, South America was
   determined. Antibodies to T gondii were assayed by the modified
   agglutination test (MAT), and found in 32 (44.4\%) of 72 chickens with
   titers of 1:5 in 4, 1: 10 in 3, 1:20 in 1, 1:40 in 1, 1:80 in 8, 1:160
   in 8, 1:320 in 3, and 1:640 or higher in 4. Hearts and brains of 31
   seropositive chickens were pooled and bioassayed in mice. Tissues from
   32 (16 + 16) seronegative chickens were pooled and fed to two, T.
   gondii-free cats, and tissues from nine chickens without matching sera
   were fed to one T. gondii-free cat. Feces of cats were examined for
   oocysts. T. gondii oocysts were excreted by a cat that was fed tissues
   of 16 seronegative chickens. T. gondii was isolated by bioassay in mice
   from 23 chickens with MAT titers of 1:20 or higher. All infected mice
   from 16 of the 23 isolates died of toxoplasmosis. Overall, 82 (81.1\%)
   of 101 mice that became infected after inoculation with chicken tissues
   died of toxoplasmosis. Genotyping of these 24 isolates using
   polymorphisms at the SAG2 locus indicated that seven T. gondii isolates
   were Type I, 17 were Type III, and none was Type II. Phenotypically, T.
   gondii isolates from chickens from Colombia were similar to isolates
   from Brazil but different from the isolates from North America; most
   isolates from chickens from Brazil and Colombia were lethal for mice
   whereas isolates from North America did not kill inoculated mice.
   Genetically, none of the T. gondii isolates from Colombia and Brazil was
   SAG2 Type H, whereas most isolates from chickens from North America were
   Type II. This is the first report of genetic characterization of T.

Abstract = {{Most studies about human locomotion only tend to consider single
   subjects walking alone in a stationary environment. Nevertheless, human
   subjects have often to plan and generate their locomotor trajectories
   according to one another's displacements. Therefore, in the present
   study we address the question of the interpersonal coordination when
   pairs of subjects walk simultaneously. Six pairs of subjects walking
   face to face, backwards and forwards on a 8 m x 2 m track were involved
   in our experiment. Within each pair, the leader (L) was required to
   break the initial interpersonal distance whereas the follower (F) had to
   maintain this distance constant (1, 2 or 3 m). We measured their
   position and analyzed their travelled distance, the time course of their
   linear displacement, and the kinematics parameters of their steps. Our
   results show that F travels smaller distances than L and that even if
   they are highly correlated, some temporal delays exist between
   displacements of L and F with greater values when the interpersonal
   distance increases (from 1 to 3 m). These results are discussed in terms
   of high level imitation, i.e. bidirectional interactions with mutual
   influences of each subject on one another. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an established anticancer modality and
   hypericin is a promising photosensitizer for the treatment of bladder
   tumors. We show that exposure of bladder cancer cells to hypericin PDT
   leads to a rapid rise in the cytosolic calcium concentration which is
   followed by the generation of arachidonic acid by phospholipase A(2)
   (PLA(2)). PLA(2) inhibition significantly protects cells from the
   PDT-induced intrinsic apoptosis and attenuates the activation of p38
   MAPK, a survival signal mediating the up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2
   that converts arachiclonic acid into prostanoids. Importantly,
   inhibition of p38 alpha MAPK blocks the release of vascular endothelial
   growth factor and suppresses tumor-promoted endothelial cell migration,
   a key step in angiogenesis. Hence, targeted inhibition of p38a MAPK
   could be therapeutically beneficial to PDT, since it would prevent COX-2
   expression, the inducible release of growth and angiogenic factors by
   the cancer cells, and cause an increase in the levels of free
   arachidonic acid, which promotes apoptosis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Early apoptotic Jurkat T cells undergo capping of CD43, and its
   polylactosaminyl saccharide chains serve as ligands for phagocytosis by
   macrophages. This suggests the presence of a
   polylactosaminoglycan-binding receptor on macrophages. Here we show that
   this receptor is nucleolin, a multifunctional shuttling protein present
   in nucleus, cytoplasm, and on the surface of some types of cells.
   Nucleolin was detected at the surface of macrophages, and anti-nucleolin
   antibody inhibited the binding of the early apoptotic cells to
   macrophages. Nucleolin-transfected HEK293 cells expressed nucleolin on
   the cell surface and bound the early apoptotic cells but not
   phosphatidylserine-exposing late apoptotic cells. This binding was
   inhibited by anti-nucleolin antibody, by polylactosamine-containing
   oligosaccharides, and by anti-CD43 antibody. Deletion of the antibody
   binding region of nucleolin resulted in loss of the apoptotic
   cell-binding ability. Moreover, truncated recombinant nucleolin in
   solution containing this region blocked the apoptotic cell binding to
   macrophages, and the blocking effect was cancelled by the
   oligosaccharides. These results indicate that nucleolin is a macrophage
   receptor for apoptotic cells.}},

   strength and no significant amount of ductility. The material was
   processed by equal-channel angular extrusion (ECAE) using a variety of
   parameters, e.g., temperature, number of passes through the die, route,
   intermediate anneal, etc. Subsequent microstructural characterization
   revealed a redistribution of the B4C particles. ECAE processing also
   eliminated residual porosity and improved the elastic modulus as well as
   other mechanical properties. The biggest improvement was observed in the
   elongation to fracture which increased to > 10\%. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

   superplastic alloys is the experimental observation that the
   relationship between stress and steady-state creep rate is often

   characterized by the presence of three regions: region I (the low-stress
   region), region II (the intermediate-stress region or the superplastic
   region), and region III (the high-stress region). Experimental results
   and theoretical consideration have suggested that regions II and I are
   controlled by the same deformation process, in which the sliding of
   groups of grains is accommodated by dislocation motion in the blocking
   grains, and that region I arises from the presence of a threshold
   stress. The origin of this threshold stress is discussed in terms of
   impurity segregation either at boundaries or at dispersion particles in
   the interiors of the blocking grains. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Cannabinoids have widespread effects on the cardiovascular system, only
   some of which are mediated via G-protein-coupled cell surface receptors.
   The active ingredient of cannabis, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
   causes acute vasorelaxation in various arteries. Here we show for the
   first time that THC also causes slowly developing vasorelaxation through
   activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPAR
   gamma). In vitro, THC (10 M) caused time-dependent vasorelaxation of rat
   isolated arteries. Time-dependent vasorelaxation to THC was similar to
   that produced by the PPAR gamma agonist rosiglitazone and was inhibited
   by the PPAR gamma antagonist GW9662 (1 mu M), but not the cannabinoid
   CBI receptor antagonist AM251 (1 mu M). Time-dependent vasorelaxation to
   THC requires an intact endothelium, nitric oxide, production of hydrogen
   peroxide, and de novo protein synthesis. In transactivation assays in
   cultured HEK293 cells, THC-activated PPAR gamma, transiently expressed
   in combination with retinoid X receptor alpha and a luciferase reporter
   gene, in a concentration-dependent manner (100 nM-10 mu M). In vitro
   incubation with THC (1 or 10 mu M, 8 days) stimulated adipocyte
   differentiation in cultured 3T3L1 cells, a well-accepted property of
   PPAR gamma ligands. The present results provide strong evidence that THC
   is a PPAR gamma ligand, stimulation of which causes time-dependent
   vasorelaxation, implying some of the pleiotropic effects of cannabis may
   be mediated by nuclear receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Plasmodium vivax is currently the most widespread of the four parasite
   species causing malaria in humans around the world. It causes more than
   75 million clinical episodes per year, mainly on the Asian and American
   continents. Identifying new antigens to be further tested as anti-P.
   vivax vaccine candidates has been greatly hampered by the difficulty of
   maintaining this parasite cultured in vitro. Taking into account that
   one of the most promising vaccine candidates against Plasmodium
   falciparum is the rhoptry-associated protein 2, we have identified the
   P. falciparum rhoptry-associated protein 2 homologue in P. vivax in the
   present study. This protein has 400 residues, having an N-terminal 21
   amino-acid stretch compatible with a signal peptide and, as occurs with
   its falciparum homologue, it lacks repeat sequences. The protein is
   expressed in asexual stage P. vivax parasites and polyclonal sera raised
   against this protein recognised a 46 kDa band in parasite lysate in a
   Western blot assay. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to establish seasonality of bovine fasciolosis in the Southern
   province of Zambia, 288 cattle were examined at slaughter at Turnpike
   slaughter slab for 1 year. The examination involved liver inspection and
   coprological examination. Liver condemnation rates were relatively high
   at the beginning of both the cold dry season and the rainy season
   (May/June and December, respectively). All cattle, regardless of age,
   had higher fluke abundances in the post-rainy season (39.1\% young and
   42.1\% adult) while the lowest rates were in the hot dry season (13.3\%
   young and 14.3\% adult). On coprological examination, the highest
   abundance was in the post-rainy season (45.0\%) and the lowest in the
   cold dry season (24.9\%). From November (end of dry season) to
   February/March (end of rains), more fluke eggs were found than in any
   other period. The distribution of fluke eggs was significantly different
   (p < 0.001) among the four seasons. Identified associations were: egg
   counts were highest in post-rainy (mean abundance = 146) and lowest in
   cold dry season (mean abundance = 118) at 95\% confidence (CI
   0.64-1.25). Differences in abundance observed according to origin, sex
   and age of cattle were not significant on both methods. Based on these
   results, it may be concluded that Fasciola gigantica was present
   throughout the year in cattle in Zambia but the abundance was highest in
   the post-rainy season and lowest in the cold dry season. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{As for all retroviruses, the env mRNA is thought to be a singly spliced
   product of the full-length transcript from the P1 promoter in the MMTV
   provirus. However, we show that envelope proteins can be produced in an
   inducible manner in the absence of the P 1 promoter from an otherwise
   complete provirus. Furthermore, we demonstrate in both reporter assays
   and the proviral context that the R region is necessary for protein
   production in transiently transfected cells and in a number of
   independent, stably transfected cell clones. Using 5' RACE, we show that
   a sequence within the R region functions as a TATA less initiator. The
   most distal part of the 5' LTR (first 804 bases of the U3 region) is
   required for the activity of the R-initiator element only when the
   provirus is integrated. Transfection with a full-length proviral DNA
   carrying a deletion of P1 in the 5' LTR resulted in the establishment of
   stable cell clones able to produce Env in a dexamethasone-dependent
   manner but not infectious virions. We therefore conclude that in the
   absence of P1, R can drive transcription of the spliced env mRNA but not
   genomic viral RNA. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of seed concentration on the mechanism of colloidal silica
   formation via sodium silicate were studied in this article. When the
   seed concentration is less than 0.62 wt\%, the mechanism of particle
   formation is dominated by the homogenous nucleation of the active
   silicate acid. Increasing the seed concentration increases the
   importance of heterogeneous nucleation via surface growth on seeds. In
   the seed concentration range of 0.62-1.36 wt\%, the formation mechanism
   is homogenous nucleation parallel to surface growth. Two kinds of
   particles, one has a small particle size and the other has a large
   particle size, were observed by transmission electron microscope
   pictures. A maximum mean particle size of the final product is observed
   at 0.74 wt\% seed concentration. When the seed concentration is in the
   range of 1.36-2.48 wt\%, the mechanism of particle formation is surface
   growth. The final particles are uniform in diameter. The particles are
   aggregated and gelled when the seed concentration is greater than 2.48
   wt\%. The particle size of the final colloidal silica was estimated by
   the assumption that the additional silica of added as active silicic
   acid grows on the seeds. The results are compared with the particle size
   measurement from dynamic light scattering (DLS). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The growth of two sources of tree regeneration, true seedlings and

   obliqua forest after overstorey removal. Three years after overstorey
   removal, true seedlings (defined as those that became established after
   overstorey removal, being plants in which the age of the shoots is the
   same as that of the lignotuber) were taller, had greater shoot biomass,
   higher concentrations and larger pools of sugars and starch than
   lignotuberous sprouts (those that became established before overstorey
   removal and, thus, having lignotubers that are older than the shoots
   they support). This suggests that true seedlings are a more vigorous
   source of regeneration than lignotuberous sprouts in dry sclerophyll
   forests under certain conditions, and that the importance of both
   sources of regeneration of dry sclerophyll eucalypt forests needs to be
   reassessed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the Rho family of small GTPases have been shown to be
   involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Currently, most of the
   available information on the function of Rho proteins in malignant
   transformation is based on the use of dominant-negative mutants of these
   GTPases. The specificity of these dominant-negative mutants is limited
   however. In this study, we used small interfering RNA directed against
   either Rac1 or Rac3 to reduce their expression specifically. In line
   with observations using dominant-negative Rac1 in other cell types, we
   show that RNA interference-mediated depletion of Rac1 strongly inhibits
   lamellipodia formation, cell migration and invasion in SNB19
   glioblastoma cells. Surprisingly however, Rac1 depletion has a much
   smaller inhibitory effect on SNB19 cell proliferation and survival.
   Interestingly, whereas depletion of Rac3 strongly inhibits SNB19 cell
   invasion, it does not affect lamellipodia formation and has only minor
   effects on cell migration and proliferation. Similar results were
   obtained in BT549 breast carcinoma cells. Thus, functional analysis of
   Rac1 and Rac3 using RNA interference reveals a critical role for these
   GTPases in the invasive behavior of glioma and breast carcinoma cells.}},

Abstract = {{Transforming growth factor-P (TGF-beta) elicits a variety of effects on
   cellular proliferation and differentiation. The major repository for
   TGF-beta is bone, where it possesses separate facilitative and
   suppressive actions on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.
   Without a direct enabling stimulus from TGF-beta monocytes cannot form
   osteoclasts but instead follow macrophage differentiation pathways. This
   facilitative action depends on an ability to promote a state in which
   precursors are resistant to anti-osteoclastic inflammatory signals.
   Following the initiation of resorption TGF-beta is released from bone
   matrix. This acts on osteoblasts to reduce the availability of the
   osteoclast differentiation factor, RANKL (receptor activator of NF kappa
   B ligand) and thereby indirectly limits further osteoclast formation.
   Thus TGF-beta has a fundamental role in the control of bone resorption
   having actions that first allow monocytes to develop into osteoclasts
   then subsequently limiting the extent and duration of resorption after
   its release from the bone matrix. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Malaria is an important cause of global morbidity and mortality. The
   fact that some people are bitten more often than others has a large
   effect on the relationship between risk factors and prevalence of
   vector-borne diseases(1-3). Here we develop a mathematical framework
   that allows us to estimate the heterogeneity of infection rates from the
   relationship between rates of infectious bites and community prevalence.
   We apply this framework to a large, published data set that combines
   malaria measurements from more than 90 communities(4). We find strong
   evidence that heterogeneous biting or heterogeneous susceptibility to
   infection are important and pervasive factors determining the prevalence
   of infection: 20\% of people receive 80\% of all infections. We also
   find that individual infections last about six months on average, per
   infectious bite, and children who clear infections are not immune to new
   infections. The results have important implications for public health
   interventions: the success of malaria control will depend heavily on
   whether efforts are targeted at those who are most at risk of infection.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic density functional calculations have been used to investigate
   the structure and stability of epitaxial vanadium oxide films grown on
   the TiO2(001) anatase surface. The formation energy Of films Of V2O5
   stoichiometry, initially low, is found to rapidly increase with the film
   thickness, at variance to what is obtained for reduced pseudomorphic VO2
   films. This is in tune with results of oxygen-assisted molecular beam
   epitaxy. The oxidation of thick, viz. >2 monolayers (ML), VO2 films
   yields a c(2 x 2) reconstructed surface, in agreement with low energy
   electron diffraction. These films are composed by partially reduced
   inner V atoms in a distorted-octahedral environment, and by isolated
   surface dioxovanadium centers exhibiting a distorted
   trigonal-bipyramidal coordination. Single scattering simulations of
   X-ray photoelectron diffraction patterns have also been performed,
   taking both 2- and 3-ML surface surface-oxidized films as models.
   Results are in fair agreement with experiments referring to films grown
   in oxidizing conditions, which suggests that coherent vanadia ultrathin
   films could be formed in vanadia-titania catalysts. The electronic
   structure of the films has been finally studied, finding that the
   terminal oxygens carried by the surface dioxovanadium species have a
   strong nucleophilic character, which makes them potential active centers
   for selective oxidation catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of granule compaction procedures on defect structure,

   using the same starting granules. For this study, changing the order of
   the cold isostatic pressing (CIP) and dewaxing procedure was performed,
   which changed the compaction behavior of the granule bed. The structural
   examination of green and sintered bodies showed that the change of
   granule strength strongly influenced the size and concentration of the
   granule related defects in sintered bodies. A large difference of the
   fracture strength associated with the change of granule strength was
   noted, and it was ascribed to the difference between the defect
   structures in the sintered bodies. On the other hand, the thermal
   conductivity was kept almost constant (> 150 W/m K) against the process
   alteration. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The reversed compound agent theorem (RCAT) is a compositional result
   that uses Markovian process algebra (MPA) to derive the reversed process
   of certain interactions between two continuous time Markov chains at
   equilibrium. From this reversed process, together with the given,
   forward process, the joint state probabilities can be expressed as a
   product-form, although no general algorithm has previously been given.
   This paper first generalises RCAT to multiple (more than two)
   cooperating agents, which removes the need for multiple applications and
   inductive proofs in cooperations of an arbitrary number of processes. A
   new result shows a simple stochastic equivalence between cooperating,
   synchronised processes and corresponding parallel, asynchronous
   processes. This greatly simplifies the proof of the new, multi-agent
   theorem, which includes a statement of the desired product-form solution
   itself as a product of given state probabilities in the parallel
   components. The reversed process and product-form thus derived rely on a
   solution to certain rate equations and it is shown, for the first time,
   that a unique solution exists under mild conditions-certainly for
   queueing networks and G-networks. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The release of monoamine neurotransmitters from cell bodies and
   dendrites has an important role in behavior, but the mechanism
   (vesicular or nonvesicular) has remained unclear. Because the location
   of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) defines the secretory
   vesicles capable of monoamine release, we have studied its trafficking
   to assess the potential for monoamine release by exocytosis. In
   neuroendocrine PC12 cells, VMAT2 localizes exclusively to large
   dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), and we now show that cytoplasmic signals
   target VMAT2 directly to LDCVs within the biosynthetic pathway. In
   neurons, VMAT2 localizes to a population of vesicles that we now find
   undergo regulated exocytosis in dendrites. Although hippocampal neurons
   do not express typical LDCV proteins, transfected chromogranins A, B,
   and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) colocalize with VMAT2.
   VMAT2 thus defines a population of secretory vesicles that mediate the
   activity-dependent somato-dendritic release of multiple retrograde
   signals involved in synaptic function, growth, and plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Catalytic activation and conversion of light alkanes by sulfated

   (present mostly as alkoxy groups), water, and SO2. Thermal desorption
   and in situ IR spectroscopy have been used to determine all three

   the catalytic activity of sulfated zirconia as well as the deactivation
   via formation of oligomers. The thermodynamics of the oxidative
   dehydrogenation of n-butane by different SZ surface structures has been
   examined by density functional (DFT) calculations. The calculations show

Abstract = {{Spatial attention has long been postulated to act as a spotlight that
   increases the salience of visual stimuli at the attended location. We
   examined the effects of attention on the receptive fields of simple
   cells in primary visual cortex ( V1) by training macaque monkeys to
   perform a task with two modes. In the attended mode, the stimuli
   relevant to the animal's task overlay the receptive field of the neuron
   being recorded. In the unattended mode, the animal was cued to attend to
   stimuli outside the receptive field of that neuron. The relevant
   stimulus, a colored pixel, was briefly presented within a white-noise
   stimulus, a flickering grid of black and white pixels. The receptive
   fields of the neurons were mapped by correlating spikes with the
   white-noise stimulus in both attended and unattended modes. We found
   that attention could cause significant modulation of the visually evoked
   response despite an absence of significant effects on the overall firing
   rates. On further examination of the relationship between the strength
   of the visual stimulation and the firing rate, we found that attention
   appears to cause multiplicative scaling of the visually evoked responses
   of simple cells, demonstrating that attention reaches back to the
   initial stages of visual cortical processing.}},

Abstract = {{Using a combination of simulations and powder diffraction, we report
   here the study of the very large swelling of a three-dimensional
   nanoporous iron(III) carboxylate (MIL-88) which exhibits almost a
   reversible doubling (similar to 85\%) of its cell volume while fully
   retaining its open-framework topology. The crystal structure of the open
   form of MIL-88 has been successfully refined and indicates that atomic
   displacements larger than 4 angstrom are observed when water or various
   alcohols are adsorbed in the porous structure, revealing an unusually
   flexible crystallized framework. X-ray thermodiffractometry shows that
   only a displacive transition occurs during the swelling phenomenon,
   ruling out any bond breaking.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the chain extension reaction of a carboxyl-terminated
   polymer using a bisoxazoline coupling agent was simulated by the Monte
   Carlo method based on the master equation. The effects of temperature
   and stepwise addition of the chain extender was examined. A comparison
   between simulated results and those calculated by an amended kinetic
   model was made. The results show that the highest coupling efficiency
   and the highest M,, can be obtained when the initial concentrations of
   carboxyl and oxazoline groups are equal, which is in good agreement with
   the experiments. It is found that a higher reaction temperature could
   lead to a bigger coupling efficiency, a higher (M) over bar (n) and
   narrower MWDs. The stepwise addition of the chain extender can only 1
   postpone the chain extension reaction, but cannot affect the final
   coupling efficiency and the MWDs when the concentration of the oxazoline
   group is lower than that of the carboxyl group. However, stepwise
   addition of the chain extender favors bigger coupling efficiency and

Abstract = {{In this paper the problem of approximate evaluation of the frequencies
   of orthotropic plates is investigated. Starting from a general
   approximate formula for the frequency, proposed by Hearmon, it is shown
   how to calculate the fundamental mode of an orthotropic rectangular
   plate with different restraint conditions using the proper coefficient
   values already available in the scientific literature. For the higher
   modal frequencies, a particular form of the Rayleigh method is proposed,
   leading to a simple procedure to calculate the fundamental frequency. In
   fact the frequency calculation is reduced to the evaluation of the
   fundamental frequency of a special plate associated to the real one.
   In order to test the accuracy of the proposed method an extensive finite
   element investigation was carried out. The numerical results obtained
   show that the average difference between the values computed with the
   approximate new method and the finite element values is less than
   0.74\%. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During the development of the cerebral cortex, progenitor cells produce
   neurons that migrate to laminar positions appropriate for their birth
   dates, adopt specific neuronal identities, and form appropriate local
   and long-distance axonal connections. Here, we report that forebrain
   embryonic zinc-finger-like protein (Fezl), a putative zinc-finger
   transcriptional repressor, is required for the differentiation of
   projection neurons in cortical layer 5. In Fezl-deficient mice, these
   neurons display molecular, morphological, and axonal targeting defects.
   The corticospinal tract was absent in Fezl(-/-) mice, corticotectal and
   pontine projections were severely reduced, and Fezl-expressing neurons
   formed aberrant axonal projections. The expression of many molecular
   markers for deep-layer neurons was reduced or absent in the Fezl(-/-)
   cerebral cortex. Most strikingly, Ctip2, a transcription factor required
   for the formation of the corticospinal tract, was not expressed in the
   Fezl-deficient cortex. These results suggest that Fezl regulates the

Abstract = {{This study investigated the role of the American oystercatcher
   (Haematopus palliatus) as a resource subsidizer for the scavenger snail
   Buccinanops globulosum in a northern Patagonian bay (40 degrees 45'S, 64
   degrees 56'W, San Antonio Bay, Argentina). The most frequent food item
   for the snails was dead crabs Cyrtograpsus angulatus Dana, and the
   snails preferred this item. In the field, most dead crabs (78\%)
   resulted from oystercatcher predation. Field densities of dead crabs
   were within the 95\% confidence limits of the estimated densities
   produced by oystercatcher foraging activity, suggesting that a large
   proportion of carrion available for snails is a byproduct of
   oystercatcher predation. Dead crabs with injuries were more rapidly
   detected and consumed by snails, probably because injuries produced by
   oystercatchers increase leakage of body fluids and facilitate
   penetration of the proboscis of the snails. Our results suggest that
   oystercatcher predation subsidize this scavenger snail by increasing
   availability of food, decreasing variability in their provision and
   facilitating their consumption. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to determine whether locally abundant crab
   species prefer co-occurring littleneck clams, Protothaca staminea
   (Conrad, 1837) and Tapes philippinarum (A. Adams and Reeve, 1850),
   relative to a recently introduced species, the varnish clam, Nuttallia
   obscurata, (Reeve, 1857). Prey preference, handling time, pick-tip
   success, profitability and consumption rates were investigated for two
   crab species, Dungeness crab, Cancer magister (Dana, 1852) and red rock
   crab, Cancer productus (Randall, 1839) crabs. Both crab species
   preferred varnish clams over the native species, This may be
   attributable to the lower handling time, higher pick-up success and
   increased profitability of consuming varnish clams. Handling time
   appeared to be a factor not only in species preference, but also in the
   degree of preference, with shorter handling times corresponding to
   stronger preference values. Both native and introduced bivalves burrow
   into the substratum, with the varnish clam burrowing deepest. When
   feeding on clams in limited substratum both crab species preferred the
   varnish clam. In the unlimited substratum trials Dungeness crabs
   preferred varnish clams (although to it lesser degree) while red rock
   crabs preferred littleneck clams. This was likely due to the
   significantly deeper burial of the varnish Clam, making it less
   accessible. Although the morphology (i.e. thin shell, compressed shape)
   of the invader increases its vulnerability to predation, burial depth

Abstract = {{The investigation of processing parameters in plasma polymerization is
   of great interest for the optimization of film properties as well as the
   comparison and up-scaling of different plasma reactors. For
   radical-dominated Plasma processes, the plasma chemistry in the active
   plasma zone determines the activation energy E. required to obtain
   stable, functional coatings. Especially, asymmetrical, radio frequency
   discharges enable a high conversion of monomer flow into film
   deposition. However, within one experimental set-up, different
   activation energies depending on the actual gas flow seemed to appear
   for pure CH4 discharges. The differences were found to depend on the
   different expansion of the plasma into the vacuum chamber, i.e., the
   width of the active plasma zone duct, which was examined using optical
   photography. Considering a geometrical scaling factor d(act)/d(gas)
   (d(gas): distance between gas inlet and deposition electrode at a
   vertical gas flow), a normalized activation energy can be derived
   determining the plasma polymerization process. The unconfined
   asymmetrical set-up is compared to a symmetrical reactor with confined
   geometry supporting the described concept for the up-scaling of plasma
   processes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Rapid, Wnt-induced changes in GSK3 beta associations that regulate
   beta-catenin stabilization are mediated by G alpha proteins}},
Journal = {{CURRENT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{1989-1997}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the absence of Writ stimulation, the transcriptional
   cofactor beta-catenin is destabilized via phosphorylation by protein
   kinase GSK3 beta in complex with Axin family members. In the
   ``canonical{''} Wnt signaling pathway, Disheveled (Dvl) is required to
   functionally inhibit the activity of the GSK3 beta/Axin complex and
   thereby stabilize b-catenin. Yet, the mechanisms that underlie Wnt
   regulation of GSK3 and stabilization of b-catenin are still not fully
   appreciated.
   Results: Here, we examine time-dependent changes in protein-protein
   interactions that occur in response to Wnt treatment. We show that
   GSK3b/Axin complexes are rapidly t(1/2) < 3 min) disrupted upon Wnt
   stimulation and that changes in GSK3 beta/Axin association substantially
   precede both P-catenin stabilization and Axin degradation. We further
   demonstrate that depletion of G alpha(o). or G alpha(q) will inhibit,
   respectively, the Wnt-induced disruption of GSK3 beta/Axin2 and GSK3
   beta/Axin complexes and diminish Wnt stabilization of P-catenin. We also
   show that direct activation of G proteins in vivo with GTP gamma S in
   the absence of exogenous Wnt will disrupt GSK3 beta/Axin2 complexes and
   stabilize beta-catenin. Finally, we demonstrate an association of G
   alpha(o), with Fz that is also very rapidly (t(1/2) < 1 min) perturbed
   upon Wnt-3a stimulation and that the Wnt-dependent effects on both GSK3
   beta/AxM2 and Ga-o/Fz are pertussis-toxin sensitive. Collectively, these
   data implicate a role for G proteins in the regulation of Wnt-mediated
   protein-protein interactions and signaling to beta-catenin.
   Conclusions: We conclude that rapid disruption of GSK3 beta/Axin
   interactions in response to Wnt leads to the initial stabilization of
   beta-catenin and that Gao and G alpha(q) signaling contributes to
   Wnt-mediated GSK3 beta/Axin disruption and the ultimate stabilization of
   beta-catenin.}},

   adsorption from an ethanol solution on Au(1 11), the adsorption shows
   nearly ideal nonideality in that the surface ratio of MES to AET in the

   in the bathing ethanol solution used for preparing SAMs, chi(MES)(soln),
   over the wide range of chi(MES)(soln) between 0.01 and 0.95. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy confirms that at least MES 80\% of AET
   molecules adsorbed are protonated in this range of chi(MES)(soln),
   indicating that the electrostatic interaction between positively charged
   AET and negatively charged MES is responsible to the observed
   nonideality. Correspondingly, there appears only one cathodic peak in a
   linear-sweep voltammogram of the reductive desorption of the SAM, having
   a narrow full width at half-maximum of about 20 mV. This suggests the
   presence of strong lateral attractive interaction between the adsorbed

Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis ( PAP) is a rare disease,
   characterized by excessive intra-alveolar accumulation of surfactant
   lipids and proteins. Therapeutic whole lung lavages are currently the
   principle therapeutic option in adults. Not much is known on the
   kinetics of the wash out process, especially in children.
   Methods: In 4 pediatric and 6 adult PAP patients 45 therapeutic half
   lung lavages were investigated retrospectively. Total protein, protein
   concentration and, in one child with a surfactant protein C mutation,
   aberrant pro-SP-C protein, were determined during wash out.
   Results: The removal of protein from the lungs followed an exponential
   decline and averaged for adult patients 2 - 20 g and < 0.5 to 6 g for
   pediatric patients. The average protein concentration of consecutive
   portions was the same in all patient groups, however was elevated in
   pediatric patients when expressed per body weight. The amount of an
   aberrant pro-SP-C protein, which was present in one patient with a SP-C
   mutation, constantly decreased with ongoing lavage. Measuring the
   optical density of the lavage fluid obtained allowed to monitor the wash
   out process during the lavages at the bedside and to determine the
   termination of the lavage procedure at normal protein concentration.
   Conclusion: Following therapeutic half lung lavages by biochemical
   variables may help to estimate the degree of alveolar filling with
   proteinaceous material and to improve the efficiency of the wash out,
   especially in children.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed geochemical analysis has been carried out on fluid inclusion
   oils trapped for over I billion years in the Roper Superbasin (northern
   Australia) in two different geological settings: in healed
   microfractures in a quartz arenite, and within partially altered
   plagioclase laths in a dolerite sill. The oil inclusions and
   co-occurring solid bitumens record multiple oil migration events
   postdating an intrusive episode (ca. 1300 Ma), most likely during
   Neoproterozoic basin inversion. Solid bitumen represents the oldest
   migration event, and occurs in secondary pore space within the Bessie
   Creek Sandstone and in veins cross-cutting the dolerite sill. It is
   interpreted to represent thermally altered oil that may have at least
   partly been generated by contact metamorphism near the igneous
   intrusion. Inclusion oils in both the dolerite feldspar and in the
   transgranular fractures in the Bessie Creek Sandstone are pristine,
   nonbiodegraded fluids with a great similarity to other bitumens, oils
   and sediment extracts from the Roper Superbasin. Biomarkers indicate
   that the oils were mainly sourced from prokaryotic cyanobacterial
   organic matter, with a small contribution from eukaryotes. Based oil
   migration distance, organic richness, geochemistry and similarity of
   source rock maturity, the Velkerri Formation, which directly overlies
   the dolerite sill and the Bessie Creek Sandstone, is the most likely
   source rock for the higher molecular weight hydrocarbons preserved in
   the fluid inclusion oils. Geochemical data indicate that the oil
   inclusions in clusters in albitised zones of labradorite crystals in the
   dolerite matrix represent a different migration event from oil
   inclusions in transcrystalline fractures in vein calcite in the dolerite
   sill and in transgranular fractures in quartz in the Bessie Creek
   Sandstone.
   The Bessie Creek Sandstone fluid inclusion oil was generated in the peak
   to late oil window (similar to 0.9-1.0\% VRE). The higher molecular
   weight (C13+) proportion of the dolerite feldspar fluid inclusion oil is
   of lower maturity (similar to 0.8\% VRE) than the same molecular weigh
   range fluid in the Bessie Creek Sandstone fluid inclusion oil. Both of
   these oils were most likely generated in the overlying Velkerri
   Formation, however, the volumetrically dominant low molecular weight
   hydrocarbons in the dolerite feldspar fluid inclusion oils have a higher
   maturity (similar to 1.3\% VRE), and may have been generated from the
   deeper, ca. 1600 Ma Barney Creek Formation in the underlying McArthur
   Group. This study shows that oil trapped in fluid inclusions has a
   greater potential to preserve pristine organic geochemical information
   than porosity-bound oils and dispersed kerogen. If oil inclusions occur
   in sufficient abundance the analysis of these tiny oil encapsulations is
   technically feasible, and can give valuable information on the
   composition of the Earth's early biosphere and Precambrian petroleum
   systems. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Gigaxonin is mutated in human giant axonal neuropathy (GAN), an
   autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. The presence of
   generalized cytoskeletal abnormalities {[}1, 2], including few
   microtubules and accumulated intermediate filaments (IFs), in GAN
   suggests an essential role of gigaxonin in cytoskeletal organization and
   dynamics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytoskeletal
   pathology remain to be elucidated. Over the years, the
   ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) of intracellular protein degradation
   has been implicated in the control of many fundamental cellular
   processes. Defects in this system seem to be directly linked to the
   development of human diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative
   diseases {[}3, 4]. Here, we show that gigaxonin controls protein
   degradation of tubulin folding cofactor B (TBCB) {[}5], a function
   disrupted by GAN-associated mutations. The substantial TBCB protein
   accumulation caused by impaired UPS may be a causative factor of
   cytoskeletal pathology in GAN. Our study provides important insight into
   pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases associated with cytoskeletal
   abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{The fact that most types of sensory stimuli occur naturally over a large
   range of intensities is a challenge to early sensory processing. Sensory
   mechanisms appear to be optimized to extract perceptually significant
   stimulus fluctuations that can be analysed in a manner largely
   independent of the absolute stimulus intensity. This general principle
   may not, however, extend to olfaction; many studies have suggested that
   olfactory stimuli are not perceptually invariant with respect to odour
   intensity. For many animals, absolute odour intensity may be a feature
   in itself, such that it forms a part of odour identity and thus plays an
   important role in discrimination alongside other odour properties such
   as the molecular identity of the odorant. The experiments with honeybees
   reported here show a departure from odour-concentration invariance and
   are consistent with a lower-concentration regime in which odour
   concentration contributes to overall odour identity and a
   higher-concentration regime in which it may not. We argue that this
   could be a natural consequence of odour coding and suggest how an
   `intensity feature' might be useful to the honeybee in natural odour
   detection and discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{Chemotaxis signal transducer protein DcrA from a sulfate-reducing
   bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough was previously shown to
   contain a c-type heme in its periplasmic domain (DcrA-N) for sensing
   redox and/or oxygen {[}Fu et al. (1994) J. Bacteriol. 176, 344-350],
   which is the first example of a heme-based sensor protein containing a
   c-type heme as a prosthetic group. Optical absorption and resonance
   Raman spectroscopies indicates that heme c in DcrA-N shows a
   redox-dependent ligand exchange. Upon reduction, a water molecule that
   may be the sixth ligand of the ferric heme c is replaced by an
   endogenous amino acid. Although the reduced heme in DcrA-N is
   six-coordinated with two endogenous axial ligands, CO can easily bind to
   the reduced heme to form CO-bound DcrA-N. Reaction of the reduced DcrA-N
   with molecular oxygen results in autoxidation to form a ferric state
   without forming any stable oxygen-bound form probably due to the
   extremely low redox potential of DcrA-N (-250 mV). Our study supports
   the initial idea by Fu et al. that DcrA would act as a redox and/or
   oxygen sensor, in which the ligand exchange between water and an
   endogenous amino acid is a trigger for signal transduction. While the
   affinity of CO to DcrA-N (K-d = 138 mu M) is significantly weak compared
   to those of other heme proteins, we suggest that CO might be another
   physiological effector molecule.}},

Abstract = {{Bars in gas-rich spiral galaxies are short-lived. They drive gas inflows
   through their gravity torques, and at the same time self-regulate their
   strength. Their robustness has been subject of debate, as it was thought
   that only the resulting central mass concentrations (CMCs) were
   weakening bars, and only relatively rare massive CMCs were able to
   completely destroy them. Through numerical simulations including gas
   dynamics, we find that with the gas parameters of normal spiral
   galaxies, the CMC is not sufficient to fully dissolve the bar. But
   another overlooked mechanism, the transfer of angular momentum from the
   infalling gas to the stellar bar, can also strongly weaken the bar. In
   addition, we show that gravity torques are correctly reproduced in
   simulations, and conclude that bars are transient features, with
   lifetime of 1-2 Gyr in typical Sb-Sc galaxies, because of the combined
   effects of CMCs and gravity torques, while most existing works had
   focussed on the CMC effects alone.}},

Abstract = {{RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) has
   become a popular tool of examining the function of various genes.
   However, many studies have failed to identify any inhibitory effect of
   the siRNAs on the expression of the target gene, even though the siRNA
   being tested had been designed sequence-specifically. In order to
   determine if this failure is due to the incorrect choice of observation
   time rather than that of the target site of the gene of interest, this
   study examined the RNAi efficiency of a vector-driven siRNA targeting
   two different reporter proteins, EGFP and d2EGFP, whose targeted
   sequences were identical but the half-lives within the cells differed
   remarkably from each other (> 24 h versus 2 h), during the time course
   after transfection. The EGFP expression levels in both cells were
   reduced in time-dependent manner but the reduction patterns were quite
   different from each other. The RNAi efficiency varied among the
   different observation time points and the time required for the maximum
   RNAi efficiency was proportional to the half-life of the target protein.
   Stable knocked down cell lines for EGFP expression were then established
   and the reduced EGFP expression levels in these cell lines were retained
   for a long period. These results suggest that the choice of an adequate
   observation time or the establishment of stable knocked down cells by
   antibiotic selection might be required for making an accurate evaluation
   of the RNAi effect on the target protein possessing a long half-life.

Abstract = {{AIM: To examine surgical specimens of pancreas with either chronic
   pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer in order to study whether ductal
   hyperplasia and dysplasia in pancreas represent precursor lesions for
   pancreatic cancer.
   METHODS: We examined expression of Ki-67, CEA, p53, and K-ras, in the
   surgical specimens of pancreas with adenocarcinomas (n = 11) and chronic
   pancreatitis (n = 12). Cellular proliferation was assessed by Ki-67
   proliferation index using the proliferation marker Ki-67. In specimens
   with pancreas cancer, we divided pancreas epithelium into normal (n =
   7), ductal hyperplasia (n = 3), dysplasia (n = 4), and cancerous lesion
   (n = 11) after hematoxylin and eosin staining, Ki-67, and CEA
   immunohistochemical staining. In cases with chronic pancreatitis, the
   specimen was pathologically examined as in cases with pancreas cancer,
   and they were also determined as normal (n = 10), ductal hyperplasia (n
   = 4), or dysplasia (n = 5). p53 and K-ras expression were also studied
   by immunohistochemical staining.
   RESULTS: In pancreatic cancer, the Ki-67 index was 3.73 +/- 3.58 in
   normal site, 6.62 +/- 4.39 in ductal hyperplasia, 13.47 +/- 4.02 in
   dysplasia and 37.03 +/- 10.05 in cancer tissue, respectively. Overall,
   p53 was positive in normal ducts, ductal hyperplasia, dysplasia, and
   carcinoma cells in 0 of 14 (0\%), 0 of 7 (0\%), 7 of 9 (78\%), and 10 of
   11 (91\%), respectively, and K-ras was positive in 0 of 8 (0\%), 1 of 3
   (33\%), 4 of 6 (67\%), 4 of 5 (80\%), respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Our results favorably support the hypothesis that ductal
   hyperplasia and dysplasia of the pancreas might be precursor lesions for
   pancreas cancer. Further evaluation of oncogenes by the molecular study
   is needed. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that chemokine-like factor superfamily 8 (CKLFSF8), a member
   of the CKLF superfamily, has four putative transmembrane regions and a
   MARVEL domain. Its structure is similar to TM4SF11 (plasmolipin) and
   widely distributed in normal tissue. However, its function is not yet
   known. We show here that CKLFSF8 is associated with the epidermal growth
   factor receptor (EGFR) and that ectopic expression of CKLFSF8 in several
   cell lines suppresses EGF-induced cell proliferation, whereas knockdown
   of CKLFSF8 by siRNA promotes cell proliferation. In cells overexpressing
   CKLFSF8, the initial activation of EGFR was not affected, but subsequent
   desensitization of EGF-induced signaling occurred rapidly. This
   attenuation was correlated with an increased rate of receptor
   endocytosis. In contrast, knockdown of CKLFSF8 by siCKLFSF8 delayed EGFR
   endocytosis. These results identify CKLFSF8 as a novel regulator of
   EGF-induced signaling and indicate that the association of EGFR with
   four transmembrane proteins is critical for EGFR desensitization. (c)

   investigate properties and cutting performance of new multifunctional
   multicomponent PVD coatings based on Ti(1-x)A1(x)N applied to cutting
   tools. An industrial cathodic arc-evaporation unit was used to deposit
   coatings from powder metallurgically produced multi-component targets.
   Coating structure and chemical composition were characterized using
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive electron probe
   microanalysis (EPMA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Coating hardness and
   cutting performance were evaluated by Vickers microindentation and
   cutting tests.
   The results show a remarkable influence of additional elements on the
   properties of Ti(1-x)A1(x)N based coatings. Alloying with elements like
   V, Ta, and B resulted in a significantly increased lifetime in various

Abstract = {{Transfer of naive antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells into lymphopenic mice

   results in severe autoimmunity resembling graft-versus-host disease. T
   cells that respond to this endogenous antigen develop into effector
   cells that cause the disease. Recovery from this disease is associated

   the periphery. Both pathogenic effector cells and protective regulatory
   cells develop from the same antigen-specific T cell population after

   Interleukin (IL)-2 plays a dual role in this systemic T cell reaction.
   In the absence of IL-2, the acute disease is mild because of reduced T
   cell effector function, but a chronic and progressive disease develops
   late and is associated with a failure to generate FoxP3(+) regulatory T
   (T reg) cells in the periphery. Thus, a peripheral T cell reaction to a
   systemic antigen goes through a phase of effector cell - mediated
   pathology followed by T reg cell - mediated recovery, and both require
   the growth factor IL- 2.}},

Abstract = {{Ti-Al-V-N coatings are potential candidates for dry machining
   applications due to the combination of superior mechanical properties of
   the Ti1-xAlxN phase and the lubricating effects of vanadium oxides
   formed between 500 and 700 degrees C. The aim of this work was to
   prepare Ti-Al-V-N coatings with a high V content (25 at.\% V in the
   Ti-Al-V target) to evaluate the influence of the oxides formed, on the
   friction behaviour during tribological tests up to 700 degrees C. The
   coatings were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering of a
   powder-metallurgically produced Ti-Al-V target in an Ar+N-2 discharge.
   High temperature ball-on-disc tests were used to investigate the
   tribological properties against alumina balls. Up to temperatures of 500
   degrees C only minor changes in tribological properties compared to
   Ti1-xAlxN coatings could be observed. Increasing the testing temperature
   to 600, 650, and 700 degrees C yields a continuous reduction of the
   friction coefficient from around 1 to 0.27, respectively. However,
   during the experiment at 700 degrees C the friction coefficient
   increases to a constant value of 0.45. Thus, main emphasis was laid on
   the examination of the formed oxide phases to elucidate their relation
   to the changing friction coefficients. Scanning electron microscopy
   investigations, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy shows that
   first a V2O5 phase is formed which is responsible for the reduction of
   the friction coefficient. The further oxidation to form TiO2 and AlVO4
   on the surface and especially in the wear track (due to the higher local
   flash temperatures) controls the ongoing oxidation. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the early universe, neutrinos are slightly coupled when
   electron-positron pairs annihilate transferring their entropy to
   photons. This process originates non-thermal distortions on the neutrino
   spectra which depend on neutrino flavour, larger for v(e) than for v(mu)
   or v(tau). We study the effect of three-neutrino flavour oscillations on
   the process of neutrino decoupling by solving the momentum-dependent
   kinetic equations for the neutrino spectra. We find that oscillations do
   not essentially modify the total change in the neutrino energy density,
   giving N-eff = 3.046 in terms of the effective number of neutrinos,
   while the small effect over the production of primordial He-4 is
   increased by O(20\%), up to 2.1 x 10(-4). These results are stable
   within the presently favoured region of neutrino mixing parameters. (c)

   Microscopic observation suggested that Stg1 was a component of actin

   suppressing the formation of a contractile ring and formation of
   abnormal aggregates of F-actin in the ends and mid-region of cells.
   Although distribution of the actin cytoskeleton was not affected by
   disrupting stg1(+), genetic interaction suggested that Stg1 was likely
   involved in controlling the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in
   cell morphogenesis and cytokinesis in fission yeast. (c) 2005 Federation

Abstract = {{Cubozoans differ from other cnidarians by their body architecture and
   nervous system structure. In the medusa stage they possess the most
   advanced visual system within the phylum, located in sophisticated
   sensory structures, rhopalia. The rhopalium is a club-shaped structure
   with paired pit-shaped pigment cup eyes, paired slit-shaped pigment cup
   eyes, and two complex camera-type eyes: one small upper lens eye and one
   large lower lens eye. The medusa carries four rhopalia and visual
   processing and locomotor rhythm generation takes place in the rhopalia.
   We show here a bilaterally symmetric organization of neurons, with
   commissures connecting the two sides, in the rhopalium of the cubozoan
   Tripedalia cystophora. The fortuitous observation that a subset of
   neurons is strongly immunoreactive for a PCNA (proliferating cell
   nuclear antigen)-like epitope allowed us to analyze the organization of
   these neurons in detail. Distinct PCNA-immunoreactive (PCNA-ir) nuclei
   form six bilateral pairs that are associated with the slit eyes, pit
   eyes, upper lens eye, and the posterior wall of the rhopalium. Three
   commissures connect the clusters of the two sides and all clusters in
   the rhopalium have connections to the area around the base of the stalk.
   This neuronal system provides an anatomical substrate for integration of
   visual signals from the different eyes.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous materials - magnesium oxide fluoride with hydroxy groups - of
   high surface area were prepared for the first time by a soft sol-gel
   method involving initial fluorination and subsequent hydrolysis of the

   FTIR, XPS, and F-19 MAS NMR. The magnesium oxide fluorides with hydroxy
   groups were also tested as heterogeneous catalysts in Michael additions.
   The incorporation of F into the MgO network led to diverse fluorine
   coordinations and high surface areas. The introduction of F into the
   framework enables a tuning of the base properties of the materials and
   leads to varied catalytic activities and selectivities. A weaker
   basicity can be obtained by the bridging of isolated OH groups in the
   MgF2 network with increasing fluorine content. The sample prepared with
   an F : Mg molar ratio of 1.6 exhibited a catalytic activity similar to
   that of calcined Mg-Al hydrotalcites and selectively produced Michael

Abstract = {{To reveal peripheral components of opiate analgesia, effects of
   loperamide, opioid agonist which does not penetrate the blood-brain
   barrier, were examined in formalin and acute thermal pain tests in
   comparison with morphine. Formalin administration induces pain behaviour
   such licking/biting of injected paw expressed as two phases. The first
   phase is caused by C-fibre activation due to peripheral stimulation, the
   second phase attributed to ongoing input from peripheral site, leading
   to spinal hyperexcitability, which is dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate
   (NMDA) receptor activation. Loperamide (3-10 mg/kg) and morphine (6
   mg/kg) reduced formalin-induced nociceptive behaviours and these effects
   were reversed by naloxone methiodide (0.03-10 mg/kg), opioid receptor
   antagonist which poorly penetrates the blood-brain barrier. Loperamide
   action was enhanced only by centrally active NMDA receptor antagonists
   memantine (3 mg/kg) and CGP 37849 (3 mg/kg), but not by NMDA/glycine(B)
   receptor antagonists showing weak or no central nervous system (CNS)
   activity. Present results Suggest that central NMDA receptor blockade
   may be necessary to enhance analgesia induced through peripheral opioid
   mechanisms in formalin-evoked nociception. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A comparison between the mononuclear platinum complexes of three
   structurally different monoanionic borato ligands is presented:
   {[}Ph2B(pyrazolyl)(2)](-) ({[}Ph2B(pz)(2)], 1),
   {[}4-Ph3B(2,2'-bipyridine)](-) ({[}(4-BPh3)bpy], 2), and
   {[}Ph2B(CH2PPh2)(2)](-) ({[}Ph2BP2], 3). The new bipyridylborate ligand
   2 is introduced in this study. The relative trans influence of these
   ligands has been assessed by comparison of the structural and
   spectroscopic (NMR) data of the platinum dimethyl complexes
   {[}{[}Ph2B(pz)(2)]Pt(Me)(2)]{[}NBu4] (4),
   {[}{[}(4-BPh3)bpy]Pt(Me)(2)]{[}NBu4] (5), and
   {[}{[}Ph2BP2]Pt(Me)(2)]{[}ASN] (6). The neutral complexes
   {[}Ph2B(pz)(2)]Pt(Me)(NCCH3) (7), {[}Ph2B(PZ)(2)]Pt(Me)(CO) (8),
   {[}Ph2B(pz)(2)]Pt(Me)(P(C6F5)(3)) (9), {[}(4-BPh3)bpy]Pt(Me)(NCCH3)
   (10), {[}(4-BPh3)bpy]Pt(Me)(CO) (11), and {[}(bpy)Pt(Me)(CO)]{[}BPh4]
   (12) were prepared, and the carbonyl complexes 8, 11, and 12 provide
   information pertaining to the relative electron releasing character of
   each ligand type. The CO stretching frequencies suggest that the charged
   borate moiety renders the borato ligands more electron-donating than
   their neutral analogues. Of the neutral platinum methyl solvento
   complexes supported by ligands 1, 2, and 3, only those of I display very
   different C-H activation propensities. Upon protonation or methide
   abstraction in benzene at room temperature, complex 4 rapidly activates
   two molecules of benzene to generate
   {[}{[}Ph2B(pz)(2)]Pt(Ph)(2)]{[}NBu4] (13). Isotopic scrambling of
   deuterium into methane in C6D6 solvent suggests the intermediacy of a
   methane a-adduct in this reaction. The double C-H activation reaction
   can be halted by addition of acetonitrile to trap the intermediate
   {[}Ph2B(PZ)(2)]Pt(Ph)(NCCH3) (14). Complex 3 also displays reactivity
   toward the benzylic C-H bonds of mesitylene at room temperature to form
   {[}Ph2B(PZ)(2)]Pt(pzH)(CH2C6H3(CH3)(2)) (15) in modest yield.}},

   Within the last decade, improved and new deposition techniques were

   spraying. These new treatments are becoming more and more common in
   powertrain and engine applications. Generating optimized surfaces for
   different types of substrate materials (e.g. Al-alloys, case hardened

   costs. Due to the new developments within these competing surface
   treatments, it becomes more and more common to substitute traditional
   treatment-substrate-systems with advanced treatments. Both the
   application potential and selected examples of different surface
   treatments will be shown. Aspects of the internal coating of bores
   inside the engine by plasma spraying, features of the corrosion

   isolation of a set of new trp alleles, including trp 14 with an amino
   acid substitution juxtaposed to the TRP domain. D The trp 14 flies
   stably express TRP and display normal molecular anchoring, but defective
   channel function. Elimination of the anchoring function alone in
   trp(Delta 1272), had minor effects on retinal morphology whereas
   disruption of channel function caused profound light-induced cell death.
   This retinal degeneration was greatly suppressed by elimination of the
   Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, CalX, indicating that the cell death was due
   primarily to deficient Ca2+ entry rather than disruption of the
   TRP-anchoring function.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of annealing on the morphologies and optical properties of
   phenyleneethynylene pentamer films has been investigated by using
   optical microscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, steady-state and time-resolved
   photoluminescence (PL). The optical microscopy study shows that the
   grainy morphology of crystallites with irregular shapes and sizes of the
   spincoated oligomer films reorganize into well-ordered single
   crystal-like laths or bamboo-like structures upon melt-crystallization
   or annealing. The crystalline features of the annealed films were
   simulated and modeled through molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular
   dynamics (MD) and further measured by X-ray diffraction. These studies
   revealed that the molecular backbones form lamellar and interdigitated
   conformations. Investigation of optical properties of the thermally
   treated films indicated that aggregates and excimers dominate
   excitation/emission processes due to molecular closely packing upon
   annealing, which are evidenced by the broadening, structureless
   absorption and luminescence spectra, as well as longer lifetime of PL
   dynamics. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Infection by oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary but not

   of HPV 16 E6 sequence subtype and allelic variation at human leukocyte
   antigen (HLA) class II loci to the risk of developing cervical carcinoma
   in situ. Non-European-like HPV 16 E6 sequence subtypes were not found to
   be associated with an increased risk of cervical carcinoma, as compared
   to European-like variants. However, an association was found between the
   HPV 16 E6 L83V variant and the DR{*}04-DQ{*}03 haplotype. This
   association has been observed in several independent studies and shows
   that both the host HLA class II genotype and viral subtype will affect

Abstract = {{A method for numerical investigation of nonlinear wave dynamics based on
   direct hydrodynamical modeling of 1-D potential periodic surface waves
   is created. The model is a part of an interactive wind-wave model. Using
   a non-stationary conformal mapping, the principal equations are
   rewritten in a surface-following coordinate system and reduced to two
   simple evolutionary equations for the elevation and the velocity
   potential of the surface; Fourier expansion is used to approximate these
   equations. High accuracy was confirmed by validation of the
   non-stationary model against known solutions, and by comparison between
   the results obtained with different resolution in the horizontal. The
   method developed is applied to the simulation of waves evolution with
   different initial conditions. Numerical experiments with initially
   monochromatic waves with different steepness show that the model is able
   to simulate breaking conditions when the surface becomes a multi-valued
   function of the horizontal coordinate. An estimate of the critical
   initial wave height that divides between non-breaking and eventually
   breaking waves is obtained. Simulations of nonlinear evolution of a wave
   field is represented initially by two modes with close wave numbers
   (amplitude modulation) and a wave field with a phase modulation. Both
   runs result in the appearance of large and very steep waves, these also
   break if the initial amplitudes are sufficiently large. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Markovian regime decoherence effects in quantum computers are studied in
   terms of the fidelity for the situation where the number of qubits N

   be applied to study decoherence in other macroscopic systems such as
   Bose condensates and superconductors. A standard circuit model quantum
   computer involving three-state lambda system ionic qubits is considered,
   with qubits localized around well-separated positions via trapping
   potentials. The centre of mass vibrations of the qubits act as a
   reservoir. Coherent one and two qubit gating processes are controlled by
   time-dependent localized classical electromagnetic fields that address
   specific qubits, the two qubit gating processes being facilitated by a
   cavity mode ancilla, which permits state interchange between qubits.
   With a suitable choice of parameters, it is found that the decoherence
   time can be made essentially independent of N.}},

Abstract = {{Background We investigated the possible association of the functional
   polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) genes with
   susceptibility to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric
   cardiac adenocarcinoma (GCA).
   Methods The TNF-alpha - 308G/A and TNF-beta + 252G/A single nucleotide
   polymorphisms ( SNPs) were genotyped using polymerase-chain
   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis,
   in 555 cancer patients (291 ESCC and 264 GCA) and 437 healthy controls
   in a high incidence region of North China.
   Results Among healthy controls, frequencies of the TNF-alpha 1/1, 1/2
   and 2/2 genotypes were 89.4\% 9.2\% and 1.4\% respectively, while
   frequencies of the TNF-beta B1/B1, B1/B2 and B2/B2 genotypes were
   12.6\%, 32.3\% and 55.1\%, respectively. No significant difference was
   found in the overall genotype and allelotype distribution of the
   TNF-alpha - 308G/A and TNF-beta + 252G/A SNPs among cancer patients and
   controls. However, both the B1/B1 genotype and B1/B2 genotype
   significantly increased the risk of developing ESCC {[}the age and
   gender adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.04 and 1.91, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) = 1.04 - 4.43 and 1.14 - 2.60, respectively] and GCA (the
   age and gender adjusted OR = 2.68 and 2.64, 95\% CI = 1.14 - 6. 29 and
   1.47 - 4.72, respectively) in individuals with negative family history
   of UGIC, in comparison with the B2/B2 genotype. When the two TNF
   polymorphisms were combined and analyzed, individuals with the TNF-beta
   B1/B2 and TNF-alpha 1/2 or 2/2 genotypes significantly reduced the risk
   of developing ESCC and GCA, in comparison with those harboring the
   TNF-beta B2/B2 and TNF-alpha 1/1 genotypes ( the age and gender adjusted
   OR = 0.37 and 0.34, 95\% CI = 0.15 - 0.92 and 0.13 - 0.90,
   respectively).
   Conclusions Therefore, the TNF-alpha - 308G/A and TNF-beta + 252G/A
   genotyping may be used as a stratification markers to predicate the risk
   of ESCC and GCA development in North China.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of pH, CO2, and flow pattern on the
   performance of a biotrickling filter (BTF) packed with plastic Pall
   rings and treating a H2S-polluted waste gas were investigated to
   establish the optimum operating conditions and design criteria. The CO2
   concentration had no effect on the biodegradation at H2S concentrations
   below 50 ppm. In the range of 50127 ppm H2S, CO2 concentrations between
   865 and 1,087 ppm enhanced H2S removal, while higher concentrations of
   1,309-4,009 ppm CO2 slightly inhibited H2S removal. The co-current flow
   BTF presented the advantage of a more uniform H2S removal and biomass
   growth in each section than the counter-current flow BTF. Examination of
   the pH-effect in the range of pH 2.00-7.00 revealed optimal activity for
   autotrophs at pH 6.00. Under optimal conditions, the elimination
   capacity reached 31.12 g H2S/m(3)/h with a removal efficiency exceeding
   97\%. In the present research, autotrophic biomass was developed in the
   BTF, performing both a partial oxidization of H2S to elemental sulfur
   and a complete oxidization to sulfate, which is favorable from an
   environmental point of view. Results showed that around 60\% of the
   sulfide concentration fed to the reactor was transformed into sulfate.
   Such autotrophic trickling filters may present other advantages,
   including the fact that they do not release any CO2 to the atmosphere.
   Besides, the limited growth of autotrophs avoids potential clogging
   problems. Experimental performance data were compared with data from a
   mathematical model. Comparisons showed that the theoretical model was
   successful in predicting the performance of the biotrickling filter. (c)

Abstract = {{The origin of cosmic rays (CR) is supposed to be closely connected with
   supernovae (SNe) which create the conditions favorable for various
   mechanisms of the CR acceleration to operate effectively. First, modem
   ideas about the physics of the SN explosion are briefly discussed: the
   explosive thermonuclear burning in degenerate white dwarfs resulting in
   Type la SNe and the gravitational collapse of stellar cores giving rise
   to other types of SNe (Ib, Ic, IIL, IIP). Next, we survey some global
   properties of the SNe of different types: the total explosion energy
   distribution of various components (kinetic energy of the hydrodynamic
   flow, electromagnetic radiation, temporal behavior of the neutrino
   emission and individual energies of different neutrino flavors). Then,
   we discuss in the possibility of direct hydrodynamic acceleration by the
   shock wave breakout and the properties of the SN shocks in the
   circumstellar medium. Then the properties of the neutrino radiation from
   the core-collapse SNe and a possibility to incorporate both the LSD Mont
   Blanc neutrino event and that recorded by the KII and IMB detectors into
   a single scenario are described in detail. Finally, the issues of the
   neutrino nucleosynthesis and of the connection between supernova and
   gamma-ray bursts are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We construct the Numerical Galaxy Catalog ( nu GC), based on a
   semianalytic model of galaxy formation combined with high-resolution
   N-body simulations in a Lambda-dominated flat cold dark matter ( Lambda
   CDM) cosmological model. The model includes several essential
   ingredients for galaxy formation, such as merging histories of dark
   halos taken directly from N-body simulations, radiative gas cooling,
   star formation, heating by supernova explosions ( supernova feedback),
   mergers of galaxies, population synthesis, and extinction by internal
   dust and intervening H I clouds. As the first paper in a series using
   this model, we focus on basic photometric, structural, and kinematical
   properties of galaxies at present and at high redshift. Two sets of
   model parameters are examined, strong and weak supernova feedback
   models, which are in good agreement with observational luminosity
   functions of local galaxies within observational uncertainties. Both
   models agree well with many observations of, e. g., cold gas
   mass-to-stellar luminosity ratios of spiral galaxies, H I mass
   functions, galaxy sizes, faint galaxy number counts and photometric
   redshift distributions in optical passbands, isophotal angular sizes,
   and cosmic star formation rates. In particular, the strong supernova
   feedback model is in much better agreement with near-infrared ( K'-band)
   faint galaxy number counts and redshift distribution than the
   weak-feedback model and our previous semianalytic models based on the
   extended Press-Schechter formalism. Observed Tully-Fisher relations for
   bright galaxies and color-magnitude relations for dwarf elliptical
   galaxies in clusters of galaxies are broadly reproduced, but no
   agreement with observations is obtained over whole ranges. Nevertheless,
   they show improvements over results produced by other semianalytic
   models. A direction to be pursued in overcoming the remaining problems
   is also discussed. We find that the resolution of N-body simulations,
   which is down to 3 x 10(9) M-circle dot for the minimum mass of dark
   halos consisting of 10 dark matter particles in our model, plays a
   significant role in galaxy formation, and that merging histories of dark
   halos directly taken from N-body simulations produce results different
   from models based on the extended Press-Schechtermodel even if the mass
   function of dark halos at present is set to be the same as that obtained
   by the same N-body simulations used here.}},

Abstract = {{We have created new dust temperature and column density maps of Perseus,
   Ophiuchus, and Serpens using 60 and 100 mu m data from the Improved
   Reprocessing of the IRAS Survey ( IRIS) recalibration of Infrared
   Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS) data. We describe an optimized method for
   finding the dust temperature, emissivity spectral index, and optical
   depth using optical and near-infrared extinction maps. The creation of
   these temperature and extinction maps ( covering tens of square degrees
   of molecular clouds) is one of the first results from the ongoing
   Coordinated Molecular Probe Line Extinction Thermal Emission ( COMPLETE)
   Survey of Star-Forming Regions. However, while the extinctions derived
   from the IRIS emission maps are globally accurate, we warn that
   far-infrared emission is not a good proxy for extinction on the scale of
   1 pixel (similar to 5'). In addition to describing the global dust
   properties of these clouds, we have found two particularly interesting
   features in the column density and temperature maps. In the Ophiuchus
   dark cloud complex, the new dust temperature map shows a little-known
   warm ( 25 K) dust ring with a 2 pc diameter. This shell is approximately
   centered on the B star rho Ophiuchus, 1 degrees north of the
   well-studied rho Oph star-forming cluster. In Perseus, the column

   filamentary chain of clouds seen in molecular gas. These rings are
   further discussed in detail in our companion papers.}},

Abstract = {{Three southward turnings of the IMF during the magnetic storm of 29-31
   October 2003 led to ring current intensifications characterized by Dst
   minima. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites
   detected low-energy ions precipitating equatorward of auroral electrons
   in the dawn/morning local time sector. These ion fluxes weakened and/or
   vanished subsequent to Dst recoveries. A survey of the DMSP database
   reveals that near-dawn ion precipitation is a main-phase characteristic
   of all large magnetic storms. DMSP and Combined Release and Radiation
   Effects Satellite (CRRES) satellites also detected similar ion
   precipitation during the main phase of the March 1991 magnetic storm. To
   reconcile these observations with elementary concepts of ion drifts, the
   data suggest two source populations. The lowest-energy ions were
   initially energized earthward of the plasma sheet electron boundary in
   the evening sector then corotated eastward. Higher-energy ions
   originated in the plasma sheet and drifted close to the Earth under the
   combined influences of time-varying convective electric fields and
   azimuthal gradients in the Earth's magnetic field. We developed a
   modified Volland Stern model to study test-particle trajectories in
   asymmetric magnetic fields and variable electric fields compatible with
   CRRES measurements. Ions with magnetic moments mu >= mu(c) approximate
   to 14 eV/nT drift duskward. Ions with mu < mu(c) are injected to low L
   shells during a spike in the convective electric field. As the electric
   field diminishes and shielding increases, these ions drift toward dawn
   much closer to Earth than any test electron trajectories. Precipitation
   in the dawn sector results from a combination of pitch-angle scattering
   by intense ambient waves and the dictates of ion drift paths.}},

Volume = {{78}},

Abstract = {{A single stimulus can induce both the cell death and survival pathway,
   suggesting that these pathways share common upstream signaling
   components. In order to define these components, human U937 cells grown
   in 10\% serum were exposed to serum-free media. This treatment resulted
   in apoptosis, which was found to be mediated by SAPK/JNK. It was
   previously reported that the serum withdrawal (SW)-induced SAPK
   activation is mediated by a positive mutual interaction between the
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). This
   study shows that the ROS/PI3K interaction also induces a NF-kappa
   B-dependent survival pathway. Despite the role of PI3K, Akt was found to
   be irrelevant to the activation of SAPK and NF-kappa B. Comparative
   analyses of SAPK and NF-kappa B for their responses to exogenous H2O2
   revealed that SAPK activation requires much higher H2O2 concentrations
   than those required for NF-kappa B activation. Moreover, high lethal
   concentrations of H2O2 were found to activate NF-kappa B and SAPK in a
   PI3K-independent manner. These results suggest that ROS induce both the
   SAPK-dependent apoptotic and NF-kappa B-mediated survival pathways, and
   these inducer signals are amplified by PI3K in the SW-triggered pathway.
   Cell death appears to be favored as this amplification proceeds. (c)

Abstract = {{We investigate crustal properties beneath the deep crustal ( similar to
   35 km) Jabalpur earthquake of 21 May 1997, Narmada-Son Lineament (NSL),
   central India, in search of a possible cause of stress accumulation in
   the region. Teleseismic receiver functions computed at nine digital
   seismographs along a 250 km long profile suggests Moho downwarp to
   similar to 52 km across the width of the lineament, in contrast with an
   average 40 km depth elsewhere. In addition, the crust beneath the NSL
   has higher V-p/V-s of 1.84 compared to similar to 1.73 in the
   surrounding, suggestive of a high-density mafic mass at depth that
   compensates the crustal root, also supported by small topographic
   variation ( 200 m) across the lineament. Presence of such an anomalous
   mass in the deep crust may lead to gravitationally induced stresses in
   the lower crust that contribute to the failure of rock along the
   pre-existing Narmada-Son fault leading to the earthquake in deep crust.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To assess gestational length and prevalence of preterm birth
   among medically and naturally conceived twins; to establish the role of
   zygosity and chorionicity in assessing gestational length in twins born
   after subfertility treatment.
   Design Population based cohort study.
   Setting Collaborative network of 19 maternity facilities in East
   Flanders, Belgium (East Flanders prospective twin survey).
   Participants 4368 twin pairs born between 1976 and 2002, including 2915
   spontaneous twin pairs, 710 twin pairs born after ovarian stimulation,
   and 743 twin pairs born after in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic
   sperm injection.
   Main outcome measures Gestational length and prevalence of preterm
   birth.
   Results Compared with naturally conceived twins, twins resulting from
   subfertility treatment had on average a slightly decreased gestational
   age at birth (mean difference 4.0 days, 95\% confidence interval 2.7 to
   5.2), corresponding to an odds ratio of 1.6 (1.4 to 1.8) for preterm
   birth, albeit confined to mild preterm birth (34-36 weeks). The adjusted
   odds ratios of preterm birth after subfertility treatment were 13 (1.1
   to 1.5) when controlled for birth year, maternal age, and parity and 1.6
   (1.3 to 1.8) with additional control for fetal sex, caesarean section,
   zygosity, and chorionicity. Although an increased risk of preterm birth
   was therefore seen among twins resulting from subfertility treatment,
   the risk was largely caused by a first birth effect among subfertile
   couples; conversely, the risk of prematurity was substantially levelled
   off by the protective effect of dizygotic twinning.
   Conclusions Twins resulting from subfertility treatment have an
   increased risk of preterm birth, but the risk is limited to mild preterm
   birth, primarily by virtue of dizygotic twinning.}},

Abstract = {{Although, beetles of the genus Tribolium first evolved as saprophylic
   insects, they have adapted to the stored products environment for
   several thousand years. In this study reproductive strategies are
   described for eight species of Tribolium that are known to occur in this
   environment. Experiments were conducted under the same conditions for
   every species, and several life history traits, including egg mass,
   adult mass, developmental time and fecundity were examined and compared
   among these species. Common reproductive strategies were not found among
   the different species and univariate analysis highlighted strong
   differences between the species for most of the traits investigated.
   Some species showed reproductive traits that are likely to give a
   fitness advantage in the environment of stored products. Multivariate
   statistical analysis allowed the detection of different sub-groups with
   respect to their reproductive strategy. Adult mass and egg-to-adult
   developmental time discriminated between groups. Intraspecific
   allometric relationships were further investigated but only a few

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{C11}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{A detailed laboratory experiment reveals the coupling between flow and
   suspended sediment properties (velocity, turbulence, concentration, and
   granulometry) in a low-density, depositional turbidity current. A model
   is proposed that explains spatial variation in the coupling through size
   segregation and mixing controlled by the interplay between upward
   directed turbulence and gravitational settling of suspended particles.
   The head of the flow is strongly turbulent, relatively well mixed,
   dilute, and coarse grained because upward directed turbulence, related
   to frontal shear and mixing with ambient water, generally outbalances
   particle settling. The body is grain size and density stratified, with
   strong turbulence confined to upper and lower flow boundaries. Here
   settling is generally more important than turbulence. Contrasting
   dynamics of different particle sizes modify the general patterns
   recognized in the head and body. Thus preferential settling of the
   coarsest particles produces normal grading in the lower head. In the
   lower body, highly turbulent, relatively low downstream velocity fluid
   packages, interpreted as upward moving, basal shear-induced ejections,
   alternate with less turbulent, higher downstream velocity fluid
   packages. Relatively coarse grains react to these flow changes by
   alternate vertical mixing and preferential accumulation near the flow's
   base, whereas the distribution of finer grains remains unaffected.
   Kelvin-Helmholtz waves generated by upper boundary shear penetrate the
   upper body. The zone of maximum flow velocity is typically weakly
   turbulent and appears to form a barrier to turbulence-induced particle
   exchange between the lower and upper flow regions. The coupling model
   entails periodic changes in grain size measures near the flow's base,
   which may explain the formation of lamination and banding in natural
   turbidites.}},

Abstract = {{beta-Carotene has been identified as an intermediate in a secondary
   electron transfer pathway that oxidizes Chl(Z) and cytochrome b(559) in
   Photosystem II (PS II) when normal tyrosine oxidation is blocked. To
   test the redox function of carotenoids in this pathway, we replaced the
   zeta-carotene desaturase gene (zds) or both the zds and phytoene
   desaturase (pds) genes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with the phytoene
   desaturase gene ( crtI) of Rhodobacter capsulatus, producing carotenoids
   with shorter conjugated pi-electron systems and higher reduction
   potentials than beta-carotene. The PS II core complexes of both mutant
   strains contain approximately the same number of chlorophylls and
   carotenoids as the wild type but have replaced beta-carotene (11 double
   bonds), with neurosporene (9 conjugated double bonds) and
   beta-zeacarotene ( 9 conjugated double bonds and 1 beta-ionylidene
   ring). The presence of the ring appears necessary for PS II assembly.
   Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy were used to examine the
   light-induced formation of chlorophyll and carotenoid radical cations in
   the mutant PS II core complexes at temperatures from 20 to 160 K. At 20
   K, a carotenoid cation radical is formed having an absorption maximum at
   898 nm, an 85 nm blue shift relative to the beta-carotene radical cation
   peak in the WT, and consistent with the formation of the cation radical
   of a carotenoid with 9 conjugated double bonds. The ratio of
   Chl(+)/Car(+) is higher in the mutant core complexes, consistent with
   the higher reduction potential for Car(+). As the temperature increases,
   other carotenoids become accessible to oxidation by P-680(+).}},

Abstract = {{Using a talin2 gene-trapped embryonic stem cell clone, we have developed
   a talin2 mutant mouse line that expresses the N-terminal half (1-1295)
   of talin2 fused with beta-galactosidase. The homozygous mutant mice
   appear to be normal and healthy. In the testis, talin2 expresses as a
   shorter form with a unique 30 residues at N-terminus linking to a common
   C-terminus from 1122 to 2453 of the long form. The resulting talin2 in
   the mutant testis only contains 204 residues of the wild-type testis
   talin2. However, it did not seem to affect the morphology of testis or
   reproduction of male mice. In fact, male and female mutant mice are
   fertile. Utilizing the expression of talin2(11295)/beta-galactosidase
   fusion protein, we have examined the distribution of talin2 in tissues.
   In contrast to talin1, talin2 expression is more restricted in tissues
   and cell types. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Caffeine-containing beverage consumption has been reported to be
   associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis. Since the
   glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a major factor in the induction of
   osteoporosis we analyzed whether caffeine may act via altering GR
   function. Applying a reporter gene assay we provide evidence that
   caffeine drastically amplifies GR transcriptional activity in human
   osteoblastic cells. Substances that increase the intracellular cyclic
   AMP-concentration also strengthen the transactivity of the GR and
   coincubation with caffeine further reinforces this potentiation,
   indicating that caffeine-mediated enhancement of GR transcriptional
   function is due to the inhibitory activity of caffeine on the cyclic AMP
   phosphodiesterase. Our data suggest evidence for a hitherto unrecognized
   crosstalk between caffeine-modulated signalling and GR-initiated gene
   expression in human osteoblastic cells and could provide the molecular
   basis for the role of caffeine in osteoporosis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The MoFe protein of the complex metalloenzyme nitrogenase folds as a
   heterotetramer containing two copies each of the homologous alpha and
   beta subunits, encoded by the nifD and the nifK genes respectively.
   Recently, the functional expression of a fusion NifD-K protein of
   nitrogenase was demonstrated in Azotobacter vinelandii, strongly
   implying that the MoFe protein is flexible as it could accommodate major
   structural changes, yet remain functional {[}M.H. Suh, L. Pulakat, N.
   Gavini, J. Biol. Chem. 278 (2003) 5353-5360]. This finding led us to
   further explore the type of interaction between the fused MoFe protein
   units. We aimed to determine whether an interaction exists between the
   two fusion MoFe proteins to form a homodimer that is equivalent to
   native heterotetrameric MoFe protein. Using the Bacteriomatch Two-Hybrid
   System, translationally fused constructs of NifD-K (fusion) with the
   full-length lambda CI of the pBT bait vector and also NifD-K (fusion)
   with the N-terminal alpha-RNAP of the pTRG target vector were made. To
   compare the extent of interaction between the fused NifD-K proteins to
   that of the beta-beta interactions in the native MoFe protein, we
   proceeded to generate translationally fused constructs of NifK with the
   alpha-RNAP of the pTRG vector and lambda CI protein of the pBT vector.
   The strength of the interaction between the proteins in study was
   determined by measuring the beta-galactosidase activity and extent of
   ampicillin resistance of the colonies expressing these proteins. This
   analysis demonstrated that direct protein-protein interaction exists
   between NifD-K fusion proteins, suggesting that they exist as
   homodimers. As the interaction takes place at the beta-interfaces of the
   NifD-K fusion proteins, we propose that these homodimers of NifD-K
   fusion protein may function in a similar manner as that of the
   heterotetrameric native MoFe protein. The observation that the extent of
   protein-protein interaction between the beta-subunits of the native MoFe
   protein in BacterioMatch Two-Hybrid System is comparable to the extent
   of protein-protein interaction observed between the NifD-K fusion
   proteins in the same system further supports this idea. (c) 2005

   equivalent of bipy (Cp{*} = C5Me5; bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine) in THF gave
   the adducts {[}M-(Cp{*})(2)I(bipy)] (M=Ce (1a), M=U (1b)), which were
   transformed into {[}M-(Cp{*})(2)(bipy)] (M=Ce (2a), M=U (2b)) by Na(Hg)
   reduction. The crystal structures of la and 1b show, by comparing the
   U-N and Ce-N distances and the variations in the C-C and C-N bond
   lengths within the bidentate ligand, that the extent of donation of
   electron density into the LUMO of bipy is more important in the actinide
   than in the lanthanide compound. Reaction Of {[}Ce(Cp{*})211 or
   {[}U(Cp{*}),I(py)] with 1 mol equivalent of terpy (terpy=
   2,2':6',2{''}-terpyridine) in THF afforded the adducts
   {[}M(Cp{*})2(terpy)]l (M=Ce (3a), M=U (3b)), which were reduced to the
   neutral complexes {[}M(Cp{*})(2)-(terpy)] (M=Ce (4a), M=U (4b)) by
   sodium amalgam. The complexes {[}M(Cp{*})(2)(terpy)] {[}M(Cp{*})(2)\}]I
   (M=Ce (5a), M=U (5b)) were prepared from a 2:1 mixture of {[}M(Cp{*}),I]
   and terpy. The rapid and reversible electron-transfer reactions between
   3 and 4 in solution were revealed by (HNMR)-H-1 spectroscopy. The
   spectrum of 5b is identical to that of the 1:1 mixture of
   {[}U(Cp{*})(2)I(py)] and 3b, or {[}U(Cp{*})(2)I-2] and 4b. The magnetic
   data for 3 and 4 are consistent with trivalent cerium and uranium
   species, with the formulation {[}M-III(Cp{*})(2)(terpy(center dot-))]
   for 4a and 4b, in which spins on the individual units are uncoupled at
   300 K and anti-ferromagnetically coupled at low temperature. Comparison
   of the crystal structures of 3b, 4b, and 5b with those of 3a and the
   previously reported ytterbium complex {[}Yb(Cp{*})(2)(terpy)] shows that
   the U-N distances are much shorter, by 0.2 A, than those expected from a
   purely ionic bonding model. This difference should reflect the presence
   of stronger electron transfer between the metal and the terpy ligand in
   the actinide compounds. This feature is also supported by the small but
   systematic structural variations within the terdentate ligands, which
   strongly suggest that the LUMO of terpy is more filled in the actinide
   than in the lanthanide complexes and that the canonical forms
   {[}U-IV(Cp{*})(2)(terpy(-))] land {[}U-IV(Cp{*})(2)(terpy(2-))]
   contribute significantly to the true structures of 3b and 4b,
   respectively. This assumption was confirmed by the reactions of
   complexes 3 and 4 with the H-center dot and H+ donor reagents Ph3SnH and
   NEt3HBPh4, which led to clear differentiation of the cerium and uranium
   complexes. No reaction was observed between 3 a and Ph3SnH, while the
   uranium counterpart 3b was transformed in pyridine into the uranium(iv)
   compound {[}U(Cp{*})(2)\{NC5H4(py)(2)\}]I (6), where NC5H4(py)(2) is the
   2,6-dipyridyl(hydro-4-pyridyl) ligand. Complex 6 was further
   hydrogenated to {[}U(Cp{*})2-\{NC5H8(py)(2)\}]I (7) by an excess of
   Ph3SnH in refluxing pyridine. Treatment of 4a with NEt3HBPh4 led to
   oxidation of the terpy(center dot-) ligand and formation of
   {[}Ce(Cp{*})(2)(terpy)]BPh4, whereas similar reaction with 4b afforded
   {[}U(Cp{*})(2)\{NC5H4(py)(2)\}]BPh4 (6). The crystal structures of 6, 6'
   and 7 were determined.}},

Abstract = {{Polytopic proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by
   ribosomes docked at the Sec61 translocation channel. It is generally
   assumed that, upon termination of translation, polypeptides are
   spontaneously released into the ER membrane where final stages of
   folding and assembly are completed. Here we investigate early
   interactions between the ribosome-translocon complex and cystic fibrosis
   transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a multidomain ABC
   transporter, and demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using in
   vitro and Xenopus oocyte expression systems we show that, during and
   immediately following synthesis, nascent CFTR polypeptides associate
   with large, heterogeneous, and dynamic protein complexes. Partial-length
   precursors were quantitatively isolated in a non-covalent,
   puromycin-sensitive complex (>3,500 kDa) that contained the Sec61 ER
   translocation machinery and the cytosolic chaperone Hsc70. Following the
   completion of synthesis, CFTR was gradually released into a smaller
   (600-800 kDa) ATP-sensitive complex. Surprisingly, release of
   full-length CFTR from the ribosome and translocon was significantly
   delayed after translation was completed. Moreover, this step required
   both nucleotide triphosphates and cytosol. Release of control proteins
   varied depending on their size and domain complexity. These studies thus
   identify a novel energy-dependent step early in the CFTR maturation
   pathway that is required to disengage nascent CFTR from ER biosynthetic
   machinery. We propose that, contrary to current models, the final stage
   of membrane integration is a regulated process that can be influenced by
   the state of nascent chain folding, and we speculate that this step is
   influenced by the complex multidomain structure of CFTR.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the rate of new AIDS events over the first year
   of HAART in patients with different characteristics and to describe the
   decrease in incidence of AIDS between the first and second 6 months of
   the year in these patients.
   Design: Collaboration of cohort studies from Europe and North America.
   Methods: AIDS rates in the first year of HAART were calculated for 22
   217 antiretroviral-naive individuals. Event rates were compared in the
   periods 0-6 and 7-12 months after starting HAART.
   Results: The number of events and person-years of follow-up (PYFU) in
   the two time periods were 1185 (9601) and 336 (8690), respectively
   (event rates: 12.3 and 3.9 per 100 PYFU, relative decline in incidence:
   68\%). Whereas rates decreased in all groups, tests for interaction
   suggested that relative declines in incidence were more rapid in
   homosexual men (P = 0.002), in those starting HAART from 2001 in
   comparison with earlier years (P = 0.03), in those with lower CD4 cell
   counts (P-values of 0.001, 0.002 and 0.11 for those with cell counts <
   50, 50-199 and 200-349 cells/mu l compared to those with cell counts >=
   350 cells/mu l) and HIV RNA levels >= 5 log(10) copies/ml (P = 0.0008).
   Those with AIDS at the time of starting HAART had a less rapid relative
   decline in incidence (P = 0.0007).
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that some groups may experience less
   rapid relative declines in AIDS incidence than others over the first
   year on HAART. (C) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}},

Abstract = {{Epicubenol and 19-hydroxyferruginol (Ferruginol) are sesquiterpenes
   isolated from the black heartwood of Cryptomeria japonica. Dendritic
   cells (DC) are specialized antigen-presenting cells that monitor the
   antigenic environment and activate naive T cells. The role of DC is not
   only to sense danger but also to tolerize the immune system to antigens
   encountered in the absence of maturation/inflammatory stimuli. In this
   study, we attempted to investigate the effects of Epicubenol and
   Ferruginol on the phenotypic and functional maturation of human
   monocytes-derived DC in vitro. Human monocytes were cultured with GM-CSF
   and IL-4 for 6 days under standard conditions, followed by another 2
   days with Epicubenol or Ferruginol. The expression levels of CD1a, CD83,
   and HLA-DR as expressed by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on
   Epicubenol-primed DC or Ferruginol-primed DC were enhanced. Allogeneic
   Epicubenol-primed DC or Ferruginol-primed DC co-cultured with naive T
   cells at 1:5 ratio, secreted IL-10 and TGF-beta, but little IL-4.
   Moreover, T cells that develop in co-culture of Epicubenol-primed DC or
   Ferruginol-primed DC and naive T cells at 1:5 ratio suppressed the
   proliferation of autologous T cells at Treg cells: Ttarget cells and
   this suppression of proliferation was inhibited by anti-IL-10 mAb. The
   expression of FoxP3 rnRNA on T cells that develop in co-culture of
   Epicubenol-primed DC or Ferruginol-primed DC and naive T cells was
   lower. From these results, Epicubenol and Ferruginol may induce
   IL-10-producing Treg 1 cells from naive T cells by modulating DC
   function. It seems that Epicubenol and Ferruginol appear to be a target
   for tolerance after transplantation and in autoimmune diseases. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{We have measured the high-resolution infrared spectrum of the radical NO

   are attributed to the Lambda-doubling splitting and the hyperfine
   structure. The hyperfine interaction is found to be unaffected by the He
   solvation. For the Lambda-doubling splitting, we find a considerable
   increase by 55\% compared to the gas phase. This is explained by a
   confinement of the electronically excited NO states by the surrounding
   He. The rotational level spacing is decreased to 76\% of the gas phase
   value. The IR transition to the J=1.5 state is found to be homogeneously
   broadened. We attribute both observations to the coupling between the

Abstract = {{Taxonomic characters of both male and female horse-hair worms Chordodes
   moutoni Camerano, 1895 ( Nematomorpha) are re-described using scanning
   electron microscopy. The features are compared with the original
   description. C. moutoni cuticle has five different areolar types in male
   while female have six types of areoles. The crowned areoles,
   characteristic of Chordodes, are surrounded by other areoles forming
   pairs or clusters. Sexual dimorphism was found in the cuticular pattern,
   the female showing two different types of crowned areoles with distinct
   distribution pattern while the male has only one type of crowned
   areoles. These data are compared to other Chordodes species that have
   been studied.}},

Abstract = {{The dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation method was applied to
   simulate the aggregation behavior of three block copolymers,

   aqueous solutions. The results showed that the size of the micelle
   increased with increasing concentration. The diblock copolymer
   (EO)(16)(PO)(18) would form an intercluster micelle at a certain
   concentration range, besides the traditional L, aggregates (spherical
   micelle, cylindrical micelle, and lamellar phase); while the triblock
   copolymer (EO)(8)(PO)(18)(EO)(8) would form a spherical micelle,
   cylindrical micelle, and lamellar phase with increasing concentration,
   and (PO)(9)(EO)(16)(PO)(9) would form intercluster aggregates, as well
   as a spherical micelle and oel. New mechanisms were given to explain the
   two kinds of intercluster micelle formed by the different copolymers. It
   is deduced from the end-to-end distance that the morphologies of the

   extendible than the triblock copolymer with hydrophobic ends.}},

Abstract = {{The infrared spectra of CH3Cl + H2O isolated in solid neon at low
   temperatures have been investigated. The CH3Cl + H2O system is
   remarkable because of its propensity to form CH3Cl:H2O and CH3Cl:(H2O),
   (n >= 2) complexes. We focus here on the CH3Cl:H2O species. Low
   concentration studies (0.01-0.5\%) and subsequent annealing lead to
   formation of the 1:1 CH3Cl:H2O complex with O-(HCl)-Cl-...-C or
   (OH)-H-...-C intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Vibrational modes of this
   complex have been detected. In addition, spectra of D2O + CH3Cl and HDO
   + CH3Cl have also been recorded. A detailed vibrational analysis of
   partially deuterated species shows that HDO is exclusively D bonded to
   CH3Cl. This is a consequence of the preference for HDO to form a
   deuterium bonding complex rather than a hydrogen bonding one.}},

Abstract = {{The cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8)-inactivating peptidase is a serine
   peptidase that has been shown to be a membrane-bound isoform of
   tripeptidyl peptidase II (EC 3.4.14.10). It cleaves the neurotransmitter
   CCK-8 sulfate at the Met-Gly bond to give Asp-Tyr(SO(3)H)-Met-OH +
   GlyTrp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH(2). Starting from Val-Pro-NHBu, a dipeptide of
   submicromolar affinity that had previously been generated to serve as a
   lead, successive optimization at P3, P1, and then P2 gave Abu-Pro-NHBu
   (18, K(i) = 80 nM). Further transformation (by making a benzologue) gave
   the indoline analogue, butabindide (33) as a reversible inhibitor having
   nanomolar affinity (Ki = 7 nM). Retrospective analysis suggested the
   possibility of a general approach to designing exopeptidase inhibitors
   starting from the structure of the first hydrolysis product. Application
   of this approach to CCK-8 led to Abu-Phe-NHBu (37), but this only had
   K(i) = 9.4 mu M. Molecular modeling, to determine the minimum energy
   conformations and explain the 1000-fold better affinity of butabindide,
   indicated that 37 cannot access the likely active conformation of
   butabindide.}},

Abstract = {{A great deal of attention has recently been focused on a new class of
   smart materials-so-called left-handed media-that exhibit highly unusual
   electromagnetic properties and promise new device applications(1-6).
   Left-handed materials require negative permeability m, an extreme
   condition that has so far been achieved only for frequencies in the
   microwave to terahertz range(7-11). Extension of the approach described
   in ref. 7 to achieve the necessary high-frequency magnetic response in
   visible optics presents a formidable challenge(12-15), as no
   material-natural or artificial-is known to exhibit any magnetism at
   these frequencies. Here we report a nanofabricated medium consisting of
   electromagnetically coupled pairs of gold dots with geometry carefully
   designed at a 10-nm level. The medium exhibits a strong magnetic
   response at visible-light frequencies, including a band with negative m.
   The magnetism arises owing to the excitation of an antisymmetric plasmon
   resonance. The high-frequency permeability qualitatively reveals itself
   via optical impedance matching. Our results demonstrate the feasibility
   of engineering magnetism at visible frequencies and pave the way towards
   magnetic and left-handed components for visible optics.}},

Abstract = {{c-Src associates with and is activated by the ErbB-2 receptor tyrosine
   kinase, but is unable to bind the EGFR. Although c-Src has been found to
   interact directly and specifically with the ErbB-2 receptor, the
   significance of this interaction is unclear. Using both chimeric
   receptor and site-directed mutagenesis approaches, the region of
   interaction of c-Src on ErbB-2 was identified. Significantly, EGFR could
   be converted into a receptor capable of binding c-Src by replacement of
   a catalytic domain of ErbB-2. We further demonstrated that MDCK cells
   that express mutant EGFR that are competent in c-Src recruitment lose
   epithelial polarity in organoid cultures, whereas cells overexpressing
   the wild-type EGFR retain a polarized phenotype. ErbB-2-dependent
   activation of c-Src results in disruption of epithelial cell-cell
   contacts leading to cell dispersal that correlates with the
   re-localization of phospho-MAPK to focal adhesions. Taken together,
   these observations suggest that recruitment of c-Src to these closely
   related EGFR family members plays a critical role in modulating cell
   polarity.}},

   reduced to a manganese porphyrin dimer. Hybrid UDFT (UB3LYP, UB2LYP) and
   UHF methods are used for the calculation of the model complex and
   effective exchange integrals (J) values are deduced from the calculated
   results. In order to estimate the spin coupling of two electronic states
   such as ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic state, we calculated both
   high and low spin states. The calculated results indicate that the

Abstract = {{The synthesis of novel thiadiazepine derivatives, that could be
   considered as constraint analogues of E-7010, are reported. These
   molecules were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity toward the
   murine L1210 leukemia cell line. Flow cytometric studies performed on
   L1210 cells with the most cytotoxic compounds showed an accumulation of
   the cells in the G2/M phases of the cell cycle with a significant
   percentage of tetraploid cells (8N DNA content). Submicromolar
   cytotoxicities were observed with compounds 2b, 4b, 4e, 4g, and 4i. Two
   of them, compounds 2b and 4b, were found to be potent inhibitors of
   tubulin polymerization with IC50 of respectively 3.8 and 2.4 mu M
   compared to 2.4 mu M for desoxypodophyllotoxin. A 4-methoxyphenylethyl
   substitution on the pyridinyl nitrogen of the benzopyridothiadiazepine
   was found to be essential for the antiproliferative activity. The in
   vitro activities of compounds 2b and 4b make benzopyridothiadiazepine
   dioxides a promising new class of tubulin binders which warrant further
   in vivo evaluation.}},

   center dot 4xH(2)O (2), have been synthesized and structurally
   characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Both compounds have
   extended 2-D sheet structures. In 1 the copper centers are linked in
   chains by double ligand bridges and these chains are cross-linked
   through the manganese coordination spheres and O-C-O bridges to form
   polymeric sheets. In 2 separate O-C-O bridged Cu and n chains are
   connected in an alternating array by additional ligand bridging to
   generate the overall 2-D structure. Analysis of magnetic data of 1
   reveals that ferromagnetic exchange between the O-C-0 bridged copper and
   manganese centers dominates the magnetic properties of this system. The
   magnetic data for 2 fit well to a model incorporating antiferromagnetic
   exchange in independent S = 1/2 and S = 5/2 linear chains with J(Cu) =
   -0.073 cm-1 and J(Mn) = -0.32 cm-1. Unlike the situation in 1, there is

Abstract = {{A detailed theoretical investigation of the catalytic role of
   hydrogen-bond- (HB-) donor molecules (water, methanol, chloroform,
   dichloromethane, and chloromethane) in the hetero-Diels -Alder reaction
   between acetone and N,N-dimethyl-l-amino-3-methoxy- 1,3-butadiene is
   presented. This work extends a previous study (Domingo, L. R.; Andres,
   J. J. Org. Chem. 2003, 68, 8662) in which the importance of weak
   HB-donor solvents to catalyze more effectively than solvents with a
   hi-her dielectric constant but no HB-donor capability as analyzed. Now,
   based on density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level
   calculations, different techniques for analyzing the nature of HB
   interaction, namely, natural bond orbital (NBO) theory, topological
   analysis of the electron density (atoms in molecules, AIM, theory), and
   the electron localization function (ELF) and decomposition of the
   interaction energy between monomers (energy decomposition analysis,
   EDA), have been applied to understand why only some HB-donor solvents
   are able to catalyze the reaction. The catalytic effect of the solvent
   arises from the improved HB-acceptor capability of the oxygen atom at
   the transition structure (TS) due to the strong polarization of the
   carbonyl group. The HB acceptor presents three lone pairs (NBO
   analysis), and the ELF shows an increment of the electronic charge of
   the lone pairs of 0.50e with respect to the reactant. All solvent
   molecules form stronger HB interactions at the TS, but only those
   presenting larger charge-transfer interactions (water, methanol,
   chloroform) benefit more from the polarization of the carbonyl group
   than other solvents (dichloromethane, chloromethane) with less
   ``covalent{''} character.}},

   reductive aggregation of permanganate (MnO4-) ions in MeOH/benzoic acid
   Solution and the first two products that were obtained from this

   {[}Mn12O12(OMe)(2)(O2CPh)(16)(H2O)(2)](2-) which was isolated as a black
   microcrystalline material when the solution was left at room temperature
   overnight. The microcrystalline material was recrystallized from
   CH2Cl2/hexanes and gave the above mentioned anion as a mixture of two
   crystal forms
   ((NBu4)-Bu-n)(2){[}Mn12O12(OMe)(2)(O2CPh)(16)(H2O)(2)]center dot 2H(2)O

   ((NBu4)-Bu-n)(2){[}Mn12O12(OME)(2)(O2CPh)(16)(H2O)(2)]center dot 2H(2)O
   center dot CH2Cl2. The anion contains a central
   {[}Mn-4(IV)(mu(3)-O)(2)(mu(3)-O)(2)(mu-OMe)(2)](6+) unit surrounded by a
   non-planar ring of eight Mn-III atoms that are connected to the central
   Mn-4 unit by eight bridging mu(3)-O2- ions. This anion is remarkably
   similar to the well known {[}Mn12O12(O2CR)(16)(H2O)(4)] complexes
   (hereafter called ``normal {[}Mn-12]{''}), With the main difference
   being the structure of the central cores. The second Compound was the
   polymeric {[}Mn(OMe)(O2CPh)(2)](n) that was obtained when the solution
   was left at room temperature for similar to 2 weeks. The compound
   contains a linear chain of repeating
   {[}Mn-III(mu-O2CPh)(2)(mu-OMe)Mn-III] units. The chains are parallel to
   each other and are interacting weakly through pi-stacking between the
   benzoate rings of different chains. Variable temperature ac magnetic
   Measurements and hysteresis Studies revealed that both anions are SMMs
   and like normal {[}Mn-12] clusters, display both faster- and
   slower-relaxing magnetization dynamics that we assign to the presence of
   JT isomerism. Variable temperature magnetic Susceptibility Studies
   establish that the Mn-III centers of the polymer are
   antiferromagnetically Coupled resulting ill a diamagnetic ground state.

   These compounds may be useful leads to develop new MDR reverting agents.

Abstract = {{We have identified a 50-km-long active fault scarp, called herewith the
   Lourdes Fault, between the city of Lout-des and Arette village in the
   French Pyrenes. This region was affected by large and moderate
   earthquakes in 1660 (lo=VIII-IX, MSK 64,), in 1750 (lo=VIII, MSK 64) and
   in 1967 (M-d=5.3, lo=VIII, MSK 64). Most earthquakes in this area are
   shallow and the few available focal mechanism solutions do not indicate
   a consistent pattern of active deformation. Field investigations in
   active tectonics indicate an East-West trending and Lip to 50-m-high
   fault scarp, in average, made of 3 contiguous linear fault subsegments.
   To the north, the fault controls Quaternary basins and Shows uplifted
   and tilted alluvial terraces. Deviated and abandoned stream channels of
   the southern block are likely due to the successive uplift of the
   northern block of the fault. Paleoseismic investigations Coupled with
   geomorphic Studies, georadar prospecting and trenching along the fault
   scarp illustrate the cumulative fault movements during the late
   Holocene. Trenches exhibit shear contacts with flexural slip faulting
   and thrust ruptures showing deformed alluvial units in buried channels.
   14 C dating of alluvial and colluvial units indicates a consistent age
   bracket from two different trenches and shows that the most recent fault
   movements occurred between 4221 BC and 2918 BC. Fault parameters and
   palcoseismic results imply that the Lourdes Fault and related
   sub-segments may produce a M-W 6.5 to 7.1 earthquake. Fault parameters
   imply that the Lourdes Fault segment corresponds to a major seismic
   source in the western Pyrenees that may generate earthquakes possibly
   larger than the 1660 historical event. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Investigation hydrologic scaling: Observed effects of heterogeneity and

Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] The relationship between soil moisture and outflow is fundamental
   to land surface water and energy balance monitoring and modeling.
   However, characterizing it at levels above a point scale is complicated
   by factors including climate and surface heterogeneity, presence of
   lateral transports, and mismatches between spatial resolutions of
   measurements and models. We investigate the distinct roles of
   heterogeneity and nonlocal interactions in scaling this relationship
   from points to areas. Locations are modeled as independent columns,
   using measured soil moisture and precipitation data in a conditional
   averaging approach to estimate the local moisture outflow relationship.
   These estimates are aggregated using a distributional approach to
   account for the effect of heterogeneity. The locations are then treated
   as one large column; that is, the moisture outflow relationship is
   estimated directly from spatially aggregated data. We demonstrate that
   statistically significant differences between the two estimates indicate
   that the system is not well represented by the independence assumption;
   that is, local outflow is dependent on local moisture and is also
   independently influenced by large-scale moisture. We applied these
   methods to data from a hillslope, a watershed, and the state of Illinois
   and found that heterogeneity and nonlocal processes significantly
   affected scaling in all three. The identified nonlocal effect is to
   decrease ( increase) local outflow during large-scale dry ( wet)
   anomalies. A possible pathway is through decreased wind speed during dry
   anomalies. The combined effect increases the sensitivity of outflow to
   soil moisture as scale increases. These results could have implications
   for specifying parameters in large-scale models, especially those
   calibrated with smaller-scale field data.}},

Abstract = {{Barchans are aeolian sand dunes that form where unidirectional winds
   blow on firm ground with limited sand supply. Although they have been
   analyzed for decades, the difficulty of conducting experiments in the
   field, due to the large lengthscale and timescale involved, is a
   considerable obstacle to understand their dynamics. However, crescentic
   patterns also appear underwater on a much smaller scale, allowing easier
   study. It is shown here that down-scaled solitary barchans can be
   created in the laboratory using the periodic and asymmetric motion of a
   plate underwater to simulate the effect of a unidirectional flow. Those
   subaqueous barchans compare very well to their aeolian relatives. Their
   speeds scale as the cube of the speed of the flow times the inverse of
   their typical dimension. Finally, the exploration of new topics, such as
   the influence of the directionality of the wind or that of binary
   collisions, illustrate that barchans can eventually adapt to any
   external perturbations by emitting one or several small barchans.}},

Abstract = {{We consider solutions that consist of solute and solvent molecules of
   arbitrary sizes, shapes and internal charge distributions. The free
   energy of interaction (the potential of mean force) between the
   molecules is analysed in terms of a screened Coulomb potential and
   renormalized charge distributions of the molecules. The emphasis in this
   work is to bring out a simple physical interpretation of the theory, but
   the treatment is based on exact statistical mechanical theory without
   any approximations. The results thereby are the true properties of the
   system for given pair interaction potentials between the constituent
   particles. In general, the electric potential from any molecule in the
   solution can be exactly obtained for all distances by using a
   (generalized) screened Coulomb potential, provided the source charges
   constitute a renormalized charge distribution of the molecule. When
   charge renormalization is done consistently, macroions, small ions and
   solvent molecules are treated in fundamentally the same manner and all
   particles acquire renormalized charge distributions that generally are
   different from their actual (bare) distributions. The electrostatic free
   energy of interaction is given by the interaction between the
   renormalized charge distributions of the molecules as mediated by the
   screened Coulomb potential. The exact formalism is also used for the
   primitive model of electrolytes. The concepts in the general theory are
   illustrated by expressing the Poisson-Boltzmann and hypernetted chain
   (HNC) approximations in this alternative framework. Conditions are given
   under which the exact theory predicts the existence of attractive
   electrostatic interaction between two identical particles at large
   distances from each other.}},

   turnover of the nitrogenase alpha-195(Gln) MoFe protein with
   (C2H2)-H-1,2 in (H2O)-H-1,2 buffers, taken in context with the recent
   study of the intermediate formed from propargyl alcohol, indicate that
   SEPR1 is a product complex, likely with C2H4 bound as a ferracycle to a
   single Fe of the FeMo-cofactor active site. 35 GHz CW and Mims pulsed
   Fe-57 ENDOR of Fe-57-enriched SEPR1 cofactor indicates that it exhibits
   the same valencies as those of the CO-bound cofactor of the lo-CO
   intermediate formed during turnover with CO, {[}Mo4+, Fe3+, Fe-6(2+),
   S-9(2-)(d(43))](+1), reduced by m = 2 electrons relative to the

   SEPR1 and lo-CO leads to a picture in which CO bridges two Fe of lo-CO,
   while the C2H4 Of SEPR1 binds to one of these. To correlate these and
   other intermediates with Lowe-Thorneley (LT) kinetic schemes for
   substrate reduction, we introduce the concept of an ``electron
   inventory{''}. It partitions the number of electrons a MoFe protein
   intermediate has accepted from the Fe protein (n) into the number
   transmitted to the substrate (s), the number that remain on the
   intermediate cofactor (m), and the additional number delivered to the
   cofactor from the P clusters (p): n = m + s - p (with p = 0 here). The
   cofactors of lo-CO and SEPR1 both are reduced by m = 2 electrons, but
   the intermediates are not at the same LT reduction stage (E): (n = 2; m
   = 2, s = 0) for lo-CO; (n = 4; s = 2, m = 2) for SEPR1. This is the
   first proposed correlation of an LT E kinetic state with a well-defined

   (dry weight), for the control, to 479 mmol/kg (dry weight), for
   treatment C. Broccoli from treatment C contained the highest level of
   Se, had the most total free amino acids, and had an extremely high level
   of glutamine (Gln) when compared to the control and the other two
   treatments. In general, the smallest addition of Se to the soil
   (treatment A) induced increased levels of all detectable amino acids
   when compared to the control, whereas increased additions of Se
   (treatments B and C) produced mixed responses. Florets from treatment A
   contained the highest essential amino acid content.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, stable source parameters are determined for small
   earthquakes in the Lunigiana-Garfagnana region using an empirical
   methodology based on coda envelope measurements that are significantly
   less affected by the source radiation pattern, directivity, and
   heterogeneous path variation, than traditional direct wave measurements.
   We find evidence that the scaled energy (e) over tilde(= E-R/M-0)
   increases with moment and source spectra are not self-similar for 3.0 <=
   M-w <= 4.6. The calibration procedure allows for an independent check of
   three important features: ( 1) that the empirical path corrections
   provide consistent amplitude measurements for the same event at
   different stations, distances, and azimuths; ( 2) that the long-period
   levels of the source spectra are consistent with independent M-0 derived
   from long-period waveform modeling; ( 3) that small event spectra are
   flat below a conservative estimate of the corner frequency and thereby
   effectively accounting for near-site attenuation.}},

   pure liquid for a broad range of cluster sizes and at different

   the water-water hydrogen-bonds in the solution are longer lived than
   those in the pure liquid for all solutions studied and increase almost

Abstract = {{An attenuated recombinant herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2),
   designated as AD472, was constructed by deleting both copies of the
   gamma(1)34.5 gene, UL55-56, UL43.5, and the US10-12 region from HSV-2
   strain G. This virus was engineered to be a safe and effective live
   attenuated HSV-2 vaccine and was tested in the guinea pig model of
   genital herpes to evaluate its ability to protect from disease upon
   challenge with the wild type (wt) virus, HSV-2 (G). AD472 administered
   intramuscularly did not prevent infection or virus replication in the
   vaginal tract, but did reduce both lesion development and severity in a
   dose-dependent manner in guinea pigs challenged with the wt virus.
   Frequency of reactivation from latency was low compared with that of the
   parent virus, HSV-2 (G). Immunization with AD472 at doses of 1 x 10(5)
   PFU generally precluded colonization of the ganglia or establishment of
   latency by the challenge virus. Results presented here support the
   concept of a rationally engineered live attenuated vaccine for the
   prevention of the genital disease associated with infection by HSV-2.

Abstract = {{A central obstacle to the design of a global HIV-1 vaccine is virus
   diversity. Pathogen diversity is not unique to HIV-1, and has been
   successfully conquered in other fields by the creation of vaccine
   cocktails. Here we describe the testing of an HIV-1 envelope cocktail
   vaccine. Six macaques received the vaccine, delivered by successive
   immunizations with recombinant DNA, recombinant vaccinia virus and
   recombinant envelope proteins. Following vaccination, animals developed
   a diversity of anti-envelope antibody binding and neutralizing
   activities toward proteins and viruses that were not represented by
   sequence in the vaccine. T-cells were also elicited, as measured by
   gamma-interferon production assays with envelope-derived peptide pools.
   Vaccinated and control animals were then challenged with the
   heterologous pathogenic SHIV, 89.6P. Vaccinated monkeys experienced
   significantly lower virus titers and better maintenance of CD4+ T-cells
   than unvaccinated controls. The B- and T-cell immune responses were far
   superior post-challenge in the vaccinated group. Four of six vaccinated
   animals and only one of six control animals survived a 44-week
   observation period post-challenge. The present report is the first to
   describe pathogenic SHIV disease control mediated by a heterologous
   HIV-1 vaccine, devoid of 89.6 or SIV derivatives. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The expression of the three Trk receptors (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) in
   otolith-related neurons within the vestibular nuclei of adult
   Sprague-Dawley rats was examined immunohistochemically. Conscious
   animals were subjected to sinusoidal linear acceleration along either
   the anterior-posterior (AP) or interaural (IA) axis on the horizontal
   plane. Neuronal activation was defined by Fos expression in cell nuclei.
   Control animals, viz labyrinthectomized rats subjected to stimulation
   and normal rats that remained stationary, showed only a few sporadically
   scattered Fos-labeled neurons. Among experimental rats, the number of
   Fos-labeled neurons and their distribution pattern in each vestibular
   subnucleus in animals stimulated along the antero-posterior axis were
   similar to those along the interaural axis. No apparent topography was
   observed among neurons activated along these two directions. Only about
   one-third of the Trk-immunoreactive neurons in the vestibular nucleus
   expressed Fos. Double-labeled Fos/TrkA, Fos/TrkB and Fos/TrkC neurons
   constituted 85-98\% of the total number of Fos-labeled neurons in
   vestibular nuclear complex and its subgroups x and y. Our findings
   suggest that Trk receptors and their cognate neurotrophins in central
   otolith neurons may contribute to the modulation of gravity-related
   spatial information during horizontal head movements. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Few studies have dealt so far with the macrophytic communities
   inhabiting the small Mediterranean rivers in South-East France. In order
   to fill this gap, it was proposed to assess the effects of natural and
   anthropic disturbances on the biodiversity in the lowland River Huveaune
   (South-East France). The Mediterranean climate in this region results in
   strong seasonal variations in the hydrological regime: there is a long
   dry period and sudden episodes of flooding occur, which greatly affect
   the plant community dynamics. The River Huveaune is severely polluted by
   organic matter. Two stations were set up, one in an upstream reference
   sector and the other in a downstream polluted sector. The standard
   sampling area of 100 m(2) was divided into plots 4 in 2 in size, some of
   which included part of the river and part of a bank. In addition, plant
   inventories were drawn up over distances of 50 and 100 in. Seventeen
   sampling campaigns were carried out from April 2002 to October 2003,
   resulting in the first systematic list of macrophyte species occurring
   in small Mediterranean rivers in South-Eastern France. The great
   variability of the hydrological factors involved leads to considerable
   spatial and temporal variations in the biodiversity. The upstream
   station was found to be less severely disturbed and to show a wider
   range of macrophytes than the downstream station: bryophytes predominate
   upstream and phanerogams and macroalgae, downstream. The Macrophyte
   Biological Index for River (IBMR) was tested and found to be a valid
   means of water quality assessment in small Mediterranean rivers.}},

Abstract = {{The system Multiple Analysis Reprogrammable TItratioN Analyser (MARTINA)
   based on titrimetric techniques has been used to kinetically
   characterize different types of sludges: nitrifying, enriched ammonia
   oxidizing and autotrophic denitrifying biomass. The titration system
   employed, combines the addition of NaOH solution and 11,02 solution in
   the mixed liquor to keep the pre-established value of pH and the
   dissolved oxygen concentration, respectively. Results obtained from
   repeated experiments performed with nitrifying sludge from municipal and
   industrial origin present slight differences (coefficient of variation
   lower than 30\%) indicating that the method is highly reproducible.
   Besides, the kinetic parameters of the enriched ammonia oxidizing sludge
   obtained using the MARTINA system are comparable to those obtained using
   the respirometry indicating the reliability of this methodology. Changes
   in the procedure may be easily implemented in order to estimate half
   saturation constants with high values. On the other hand, experiments in
   anoxic conditions applied to the estimation of the kinetic parameters of
   the autotrophic denitrifying biomass have been successfully performed,
   even if this process involves a reaction characterized by slight pH
   changes. The titration system MARTINA is a reproducible, reliable,
   versatile and precise alternative to the traditional respirometric and
   substrate monitoring tests for the characterization of kinetics for a
   wide range of sludges in aerobic or anoxic conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background. Combined transplantation of the lungs and liver is indicated
   for patients who would not be expected to survive transplantation of
   either organ alone. No single center has accumulated a significant
   experience, and as a result the expectations for this operation in the
   current era are unknown.
   Methods. Patients that have undergone combined lung-liver
   transplantation in the United States were enrolled through the United
   Network for Organ Sharing Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network
   database. In addition, the English-language literature was searched for
   additional cases of combined lung-liver transplantation.
   Results. Eleven patients have undergone combined lung and liver
   transplantation in the United States at different centers. The 1- and
   5-year patient survival rates are of 79\% and 63\%, respectively, and no
   patient has required retransplantation. These patient survival rates are
   equivalent to similar a combined lung-liver case series from the United
   Kingdom (P=0.37, log-rank test) and isolated orthotopic liver
   transplantation in the United States (P=0.59, log-rank test) and are
   comparable to patient survival rates following isolated lung
   transplantation in the United States.
   Conclusions. Patient survival of combined lung-liver transplantation is
   comparable to that of isolated liver and isolated bilateral lung
   transplantation. This option should be considered for patients with
   end-stage lung disease and liver disease when transplantation of a
   single organ transplantation is precluded by severe disease in the other
   organ system.}},

Abstract = {{Activated astroglial cells are implicated in neuropathogenesis of many
   infectious and inflammatory diseases of the brain. A number of
   inflammatory mediators and cytokines have been proposed to play a key
   role in glial cell-related brain damage. Cytokine production seems to be
   initiated by signaling through TLR4/type I IL-IR (IL-1RI) in response to
   their ligands, LPS and IL-1 beta, playing vital roles in innate host
   defense against infections, inflammation, injury, and stress. We have
   shown that glial cells are stimulated by ethanol, up-regulating
   cytokines and inflammatory mediators associated with TLR4 and IL-1RI
   signaling pathways in brain, suggesting that ethanol may contribute to
   brain damage via inflammation. We explore the possibility that ethanol,
   in the absence of LPS or IL-1 beta, triggers signaling pathways and
   inflammatory mediators through TLR4 and/or IL-1RI activation in
   astrocytes. We show in this study that ethanol, at physiologically
   relevant concentrations, is capable of inducing rapid phosphorylation
   within 10 min of IL-1R-associated kinase, ERK1/2, stress-activated
   protein kinase/JNK, and p38 MAPK in astrocytes. Then an activation of
   NF-kappa B and AP-1 occurs after 30 min of ethanol treatment along with
   an up-regulation of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2
   expression. Finally, we note an increase in cell death after 3 h of
   treatment. Furthermore, by using either anti-TLR4- or
   anti-IL-1RI-neutralizing Abs, before and during ethanol treatment, we
   inhibit ethanol-induced signaling events, including NF-kappa B and AP-1
   activation, inducible NO synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 up-regulation
   and astrocyte death. In summary, these findings indicate that both TLR4
   and IL-1RI activation occur upon ethanol treatment, and suggest that
   signaling through these receptors mediates ethanol-induced inflammatory
   events in astrocytes and brain.}},

Abstract = {{In humans, the primary visual cortex (V1) is essential for conscious
   vision. However, even without V1 and in the absence of awareness, some
   preserved ability to accurately respond to visual inputs has been
   demonstrated, a phenomenon referred to as blindsight. We used
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to deactivate V1, producing
   transient blindness for visual targets presented in a foveal,
   TMS-induced scotoma. Despite unawareness of these targets, performance
   on forced choice discrimination tasks for orientation (experiment 1) and
   color (experiment 2) were both significantly above chance. In addition
   to demonstrating that TMS can be successfully used to induce blindsight
   within a normal population, these results suggest a functioning
   geniculoextrastriate visual pathway that bypasses V1 and can process
   orientation and color in the absence of conscious awareness.}},

   patients had significantly shorter disease-free survival (p < 0.01,
   both) and cause-specific overall survival (p = 0.01, p < 0.01,
   respectively). Patients with iNOS-positive/COX-2-positive tumors had the
   poorest survival rates. Coexpression of iNOS/COX-2, together with bulky
   tumor and advanced stage were independent prognostic factors for
   disease-free survival.
   Conclusions: Overexpression of iNOS or COX-2 or both was associated with
   decreased survival and a greater propensity to metastasize in cervical
   cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. Coexpression of iNOS and
   COX-2 may represent a useful biologic marker in patients receiving
   radical radiotherapy for cervical cancer. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper surveys the phenomenon of plastic instabilities occurring in
   depth sensing indentation measurements, during which a stepwise increase
   has been observed in the indentation depth-load (F-h) curves measured in
   constant loading rate mode. In these measurements, plastic instability -
   serrated indentation - manifests itself as hardness oscillations around
   a nearly constant value of the conventional dynamic microhardness.
   Investigations presented here are focused on both kinematic and dynamic
   characterization of Portevin-Le Chatelier type indentation
   instabilities. The effect of important factors such as solute
   concentration and polycrystalline grain size is described and discussed.
   Taking into account the experimental observations, a macro-mechanical
   dynamic model was also proposed for the characterization of indentation
   instabilities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetic adsorption isotherms were obtained by gravimetric determination
   of water adsorption into fully hydroxylated mesoporous silicas using
   samples exposed to controlled humidity air at 22 +/- 2 degrees C. Twenty
   kinetic isotherms at several relative humidities (11, 33, 43, 51, 75,
   and 85\%) were obtained with 11 different batches of silica using this
   simple procedure to obtain quantitative information on the formation of
   H2O adsorbates. The H2O surface concentrations obtained from the plateau
   data of individual kinetic adsorption isotherms at 43 and 51 \% RH,
   typically precise to about +/- 1\%, show that a complete monolayer is
   formed with negligible second-layer adsorption at these relative
   humidities. This monolayer has a surface concentration of 7.68 +/- 0.30
   mu mol H2O/m(2), which is lower than the quasi-equilibrium concentration
   at these relative humidities obtained by the conventional
   equilibrium-isotherm procedure. Comparison with the Kiselev-Zhuravlev
   concentration of silanol groups on fully hydroxylated silicas (7.6 +/-
   0.8 mu mol SiOH/m(2)) confirms 1:1 H2O:SiOH stoichiometry of this

   5.7 +/- 0.1 mu mol H2O/m(2) is suggested by isotherms at 11 and 33\% RH,

   suggested by kinetic isotherms at 75 and 85\% RH. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Roscovitine modulates DNA repair and senescence: Implications for
   combination chemotherapy}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{8158-8171}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Treatment of tumor cells by chemotherapy activates a series of
   responses ranging from apoptosis to premature senescence and repair.
   Survival responses are characterized by inhibition of cyclin-dependent
   kinases. Because inhibition of cycl in-dependent kinases represents a
   distinctive feature of DNA damage-induced prosurvival responses, we
   investigated the possibility that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
   roscovitine modulates drug-induced responses in human adenocarcinoma
   cells, favoring cell survival.
   Experimental Design: Sublethal concentrations of doxcrubicin were used
   to induce premature senescence in human adenocarcinoma cells. The effect
   of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine on the
   doxorubicin-dependent cell cycle checkpoint activation and DNA repair
   pathways was evaluated.
   Results: Roscovitine reinforces doxorubicin-dependent G, checkpoint in
   A549 and HEC1B cells leading to decreased frequency of double-strand
   breaks and to the preferential induction of senescence and enhanced
   clonogenic survival. However, in other tumor cell lines, such as HCT116
   and H1299, combined treatment with doxorubicin and roscovitine increases
   the frequency of double-strand breaks and dramatically sensitizes to
   doxorubicin. This unexpected effect of roscovitine depends on a novel
   ability to inhibit DNA double-strand break repair processes and requires
   inactivation of the pRb pathway,
   Conclusions: Roscovitine, by hindering DNA repair processes, has the
   potential to inhibit recovery of mildly damaged tumor cells after
   doxorubicin treatment and to increase the susceptibility of tumor cells
   to chemotherapy. However, in some tumor cells, the cell cycle inhibitory
   function of roscovitine prevails over the DNA repair inhibitory
   activity, favoring premature senescence and clonogenic growth. These
   data indicate a novel mechanism underlying combined chemotherapy, which
   may have wide application in treatment of carcinomas.}},

Abstract = {{Blastocrithidia culicis and Crithidia deanei are trypanosomatid protozoa
   of insects that normally contain intracellular symbiotic bacteria. The
   protozoa can be rid of their endosymbionts by antibiotics, producing a
   cured cell line. Here, we analyzed the glycoconjugate profiles of
   endosymbiont-harboring and cured strains of B. culicis and C. deanei by
   Western blotting and flow cytometry analyses using lectins that
   recognize specifically sialic acid and mannose-like residues. The
   absence of the endosymbiont increased the intensity of the lectins
   binding on both trypanosomatids. In addition, wild and cured
   strain-specific glycoconjugate bands were identified. The role of the
   surface saccharide residues on the interaction with explanted guts from
   Aedes aegypti gut was assessed. The aposymbiotic strains of B. culicis
   and C. deanei presented interaction rates 3.3- and 2.3-fold lower with
   the insect gut, respectively, when compared with the
   endosymbiont-bearing strains. The interaction rate of sialidase-treated
   cells of the wild and cured strains of B. culicis and C deanei was
   reduced in at least 90\% in relation to the control. The interaction of
   B. culicis (wild strain) with explanted guts was inhibited in the
   presence of mucin (56\%), fetuin (62\%), sialyllactose (64\%) and
   alpha-methyl-(D)-mannoside (80\%), while in C. deanei (wild strain) the
   inhibition was 53\%, 56\%, 79\% and 34\%, respectively. Collectively,
   our results suggest a possible involvement of sialomolecules and
   mannose-rich glycoconjugates in the interaction between insect
   trypanosomatids and the invertebrate host. (c) 2005 Federation of

Abstract = {{Objective-To identify types of musculoskeletal problems associated with
   lameness or poor performance in horses used for barrel racing.
   Design-Retrospective case series.
   Animals-118 horses.
   Procedure-Medical records were reviewed for information on signalment,
   history, physical and lameness examination findings, diagnostic tests
   performed, diagnosis, and treatment.
   Results-Most horses were examined because of lameness (n = 72 {[}61\%])
   rather than poor performance (46 {[}39\%]), but owner complaint was not
   significantly associated with age or body weight of the horse. The most
   common performance change was refusal or failure to turn properly around
   the first barrel (19/46 {[}41\%]). The right forelimb (n = 57 {[}48\%])
   was most commonly affected, followed by the left forelimb (51 {[}43\%]),
   the left hind limb (31 {[}26\%]), and the right hind limb (25 {[}21\%]).
   In 31 horses (26\%), both forelimbs were affected, and in 6 (5\%), both
   hind limbs were affected. The most common musculoskeletal problems were
   forelimb foot pain only (n = 39 {[}33\%]), osteoarthritis of the distal
   tarsal joints (17 {[}14\%]), suspensory ligament desmitis (15 {[}13\%]),
   forelimb foot pain with distal tarsal joint osteoarthritis (11 {[}9\%]),
   and bruised feet (10 {[}8.5\%]). In 81 (69\%) horses, the affected joint
   was treated with intra-articular medications.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggest that in horses used
   for barrel racing that are examined because of lameness or poor
   performance the forelimbs are more likely to be affected than the hind
   limbs, with forelimb foot pain and osteoarthritis of the distal tarsal
   joints being the most common underlying abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{Using fluid mechanics, we reinterpret the mantle images obtained from
   global and regional tomography together with geochemical, geological and
   paleomagnetic observations, and attempt to unravel the pattern of
   convection in the Indo-Atlantic ``box{''} and its temporal evolution
   over the last 260 Myr. The << box >> presently contains a) a broad slow
   seismic anomaly at the CMB which has a shape similar to Pangea 250 Myr
   ago, and which divides into several branches higher in the lower mantle,
   b) a ``superswell, centered on the western edge of South Africa, c) at
   least 6 ``primary hotspots{''} with long tracks related to traps, and d)
   numerous smaller hotspots. In the last 260 Myr, this mantle box has
   undergone 10 trap events, 7 of them related to continental breakup.
   Several of these past events are spatially correlated with present-day
   seismic anomalies and/or upwellings. Laboratory experiments show that
   superswells, long-lived hotspot tracks and traps may represent three
   evolutionary stages of the same phenomenon, i.e. episodic
   destabilization of a hot, chemically heterogeneous thermal boundary
   layer, close to the bottom of the mantle. When scaled to the Earth's
   mantle, its recurrence time is on the order of 100-200 Myr. At any given
   time, the Indo-Atlantic box should contain 3 to 9 of these instabilities
   at different stages of their development, in agreement with
   observations. The return flow of the downwelling slabs, although
   confined to two main << boxes >> (Indo-Atlantic and Pacific) by
   subduction zone geometry, may therefore not be passive, but rather take
   the form of active thermochemical instabilities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Both biotic and abiotic stress activate the oxylipin pathway in plants.
   As reactive electrophile species (RES), some oxylipins are expected to
   bind cellular nucleophiles in a Michael-type addition reaction. Using
   the HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry techniques, we have established the
   analytical basis for the investigation of oxylipin conjugation to
   glutathione (GSH) in plant extracts. The GSH adducts to the four keto
   fatty acid isomers issued from both linoleic and linolenic acids were
   first produced and their mass spectrometric features analyzed in the
   positive electrospray ionization mode. In all cases, the main
   fragmentation (MS2 mode) of the pseudomolecular ion leads to the neutral
   loss of a glutamyl moiety (- 129 Da), affording an ion that gives
   structural information upon an additional fragmentation (MS3 mode). The
   glutamyl loss was confirmed by the analysis of other GSH adducts to
   oxylipin RES and appeared as being characteristic of GSH adducts. It is
   thus proposed to search GSH adducts in plant extracts by HPLC-MS/MS,
   using initially the neutral loss mode and then the MS2 mode to further
   characterize the identified compounds. This methodology was successfully
   applied to the analysis of GSH adducts upon infiltration into leaves of
   the four previous keto fatty acids at 5 mM, a concentration inducing
   cell death. The production of GSH adducts to oxylipin RES was observed
   for the first time in plant tissues. Furthermore, the levels of adduct
   production explain in part the observed GSH depletion. These results
   support the role of RES in altering protein activities and cellular
   redox balance of plant cells, via addition reactions to cellular
   nucleophiles.}},

Abstract = {{Due to non-polynomial hardness, the facility layout problem (FLP)
   becomes more critical when pickup/drop-off (P/D) locations are
   considered in the design of an open field layout under a manufacturing

   layout problem based on random search techniques and its solution
   methodology using a genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA) and
   a hybrid algorithm (HA). The paper illustrates the performance of
   different random search operating parameters in solving the facility
   layout problem considering P/D locations along the periphery of
   rectangular machine blocks. The preliminary experiments were carried out
   on three facility layout test problems having six, eight and ten
   machines in order to fix the different operating parameters such as
   crossover operator, crossover rate, initial temperature, temperature
   reduction factor, number of generations, population size, etc. The
   results of extensive preliminary experimentation were utilized to solve
   facility layout problems having 12 and IS machines and, finally, were
   compared with the existing procedures in the literature. The
   experimental tables and related analysis performed via the solution
   methods by applying GA, SA and HA revealed that random-search-based

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of patient age on the
   clinical presentation of syncope and to establish the diagnostic value
   of clinical history in older patients. A total of 485 consecutive
   patients with unexplained syncope referred to secondary and tertiary
   hospitals were divided into 2 predefined age groups: 224 patients < 65
   years and 261 patients;>= 65 years. The diagnostic criteria for the
   cause of syncope were developed before the beginning of the study. The
   clinical features of syncope were analyzed using a standard 46-item
   form. A cardiac cause of syncope was established in 27 younger (12\%)
   and 89 older (34\%) patients. A neurally mediated cause was established
   in 154 younger (68\%) and 142 older (54\%) patients. In patients :2:65
   years, the clinical features of cardiac and neurally mediated syncope
   were very similar. The diagnosis of the cause of syncope was possible on
   the basis of the history alone in 26\% younger and 5\% older patients (p
   < 0.0001). Myoclonic movements, effort syncope, and supine position
   during loss of consciousness were the most specific (97\%, 99\%, and
   99\%, respectively) diagnostic criteria for a cardiac cause of syncope
   in older patients, but, all together, they accounted for only 14\% of
   patients. In conclusion, compared with younger patients, the medical
   history has a limited value in the diagnosis of the cause of syncope in
   older patients. The specificity of some features is high but these can
   be observed in only a minority of patients. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: Three-dimensional treatment planning systems and inverse
   planning optimization for brachytherapy are becoming commercially
   available. Guidelines for target delineation and dose constrictions have
   not been established using this new software. In this study we describe
   a method of target delineation for the tandem and ovoids applicator. We
   then compare inverse planning dose distributions with the traditional
   methods of prescribing dose.
   Methods and Materials: Target and organ-at-risk volumes were defined
   using systematic guidelines on 15 patients treated in our department
   with high-dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer using tandem and
   ovoids. High-dose-rate distributions were created according to three
   different dose optimization protocols: inverse planning simulated
   annealing (IPSA), point A, and point A with a normalization of 2 cc of
   the bladder receiving 80\% of the dose (bladder-sparing method). An
   uniform cost function for dose constraints was applied to all IPSA
   generated plans, and no manual optimization was allowed for any planning
   method.
   Results: Guidelines for target and structure-at-risk volumes, as well as
   dose constraint cost functions, were established. Dose-volume histogram
   analysis showed that the IPSA algorithm indicated no difference in tumor
   coverage compared with point A optimization while decreasing dose to the
   bladder and rectum. The IPSA algorithm provided better target volume
   coverage compared with bladder-sparing method with equivalent doses to
   the bladder and rectum.
   Conclusions: This study uses a systematic approach for delineating
   target and organ-at-risk volumes and a uniform cost function for
   generating IPSA plans for cervical cancer using tandem and ovoids.
   Compared with conventional dose prescription methods, IPSA provides a
   consistent method of optimization that maintains or improves target
   coverage while decreasing dose to normal structures. Image-guided
   brachytherapy and inverse planning improve brachytherapy dosimetry. (c)

Abstract = {{Studies on mechanical stratigraphy show that a link exists among facies,
   sedimentary cycles, diagenesis and fracturing. Understanding this link
   is fundamental for characterising fluid flow in natural reservoirs,
   especially carbonate ones. This work investigates the field of evidence
   through a case study in the Umbria-Marche Apennines: the Lower Jurassic
   shallow water carbonates of the Calcare Massiccio unit, a potential
   carbonate reservoir. A multidisciplinary approach is used, involving
   stratigraphy, sedimentology and structural geology.
   The studied succession crops out at the core of an ENE-verging
   anticline, located at Campolarzo, within the Umbria-Marche Apennines.
   The Calcare Massiccio here consists of high-frequency, metre-scale,
   shallowing upward, peritidal cycles. Three different cycles (thickness
   ranging from 0.3 to 3 m) have been recognised: type A (incomplete
   asymmetric cycle), type B (complete asymmetric cycle with sheet cracks)
   and type C (complete asymmetric cycle with tepees). Sedimentary textures
   vary according to the depositional environment. The subtidal facies is
   almost entirely mud-supported, with the exception of type A cycle, which
   locally can be grain-supported. The intertidal facies is from mud- to
   grain-supported and commonly laminated. The supratidal facies may be
   either absent (type A) or represented by vadose pisoid caliches, sheet
   cracks (type B) and tepees (type C). The overprinting of diagenetic
   facies (early diagenesis) is particularly evident in the supratidal
   intervals of type C cycle (tepee structures) and in the inter-supratidal
   intervals of type B cycle (sheet cracks).
   The fracture pattern within the Calcare Massiccio mainly consists of
   systematic joints organized in two prominent mutually perpendicular sets
   (orthogonal joints) and two subordinate non-perpendicular sets (diagonal
   joints). The orthogonal sets are interpreted as tensile joints developed
   sub-parallel (longitudinal joints) and sub-perpendicular (cross joints)
   to the NNW-SSE axial trend of the host anticline. The diagonal joints
   are interpreted as shear joints.
   In the study area, the fracture density is strongly controlled by
   heterogeneities of rock properties between and within facies, which in
   turn are determined by sedimentary textures and, dominantly, by the
   combination of sedimentary and diagenetic facies, e.g., by the
   petrofacies. The control played by the petrofacies distribution across
   the stratigraphic succession may justify strong variations in the
   fracture density (up to ca. 80\% or more) within the same sedimentary
   cycle, as well as fracture terminations, independently from tectonic
   causes. A systematic decrease in fracture density going from subtidal to
   intertidal to inter-supratidal and tepee facies is evident. Minimum
   values are observed on tepee structures; fractures often terminate
   against supratidal intervals with tepee. The lowest fracture density
   characterises petrofacies where early diagenetic processes are more
   pronounced (i.e., the intertidal facies and the inter-supratidal facies
   with tepee, strongly affected by early dissolution cavities filled by
   early cements). No obvious correlation is observed between the fracture
   density and the thickness of the petrofacies layer. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The formation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain is a key
   neurodegenerative event in Alzheimer's disease. Small molecules capable
   of binding to the peripheral anionic site of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
   have been shown to inhibit the AChE-induced aggregation of the
   beta-amyloid peptide. Using the combination of a computational docking
   model and experimental screening, five compounds that completely blocked
   the amyloidogenic effect of AChE were rapidly identified from an similar
   to 200-member library of compounds designed to disrupt protein-protein
   interactions. Critical to this docking model was the inclusion of two
   explicit water molecules that are tightly bound to the enzyme.
   Interestingly, none of the tested compounds inhibited the related enzyme
   butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) up to their aqueous solubility limits.
   These compounds are among the most potent inhibitors of amyloid
   beta-peptide aggregation and are equivalent only to propidium, a
   well-characterized AChE peripheral anionic site binder and aggregation
   inhibitor.}},

Abstract = {{When assessing the potential of a contaminated site for bioremediation,
   it is desirable to know how much of the contaminant(s) is available for
   microbial degradation, thus allowing the likelihood of successful
   bioremediation to be predicted. The aims of this study were to
   investigate the degradation of PAHs in two soils by a catabolic inoculum
   and indigenous soil microflora and link this to the cyclodextrin
   extractable fraction in the presence of transformer oil (0.05, 0.01, or
   0.005\%). This study showed very little difference between indigenous
   and inoculum-derived degradation for phenanthrene in laboratory-aged
   soil, and strong relationships were also observed between both of the
   microbial degradative conditions and the amount of phenanthrene
   extracted by cyclodextrin. Furthermore, the indigenous degradation of
   PAHs in a field-contaminated soil showed significant linear correlations
   with the cyclodextrin extractable fraction, with gradients approximating
   to 1. There are several novel facets to this study. First, in aged,
   contaminated soils, indigenous microflora gave an equally sensitive
   determination of degradative availability as that measured by the
   catabolic inoculum. Second, this is the first time intrinsic
   biodegradation of PAHs has been predicted by the cyclodextrin extraction
   in laboratory-spiked and field-contaminated soils. The cyclodextrin
   extraction technique represents a powerful tool for predicting the
   extent of intrinsic and augmented microbial degradation and will be
   useful in the assessment of contaminated land prior to bioremediation.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. The seminoma class of testicular germ cell tumor ((TGCT) are
   characterized by a morphological resemblance to primordial germ cells
   (PGCs) or gonocytes, and chromosome duplications at 12p. Recently, it
   was determined that human embryonic stern cells (hESCs) express genes in
   common with PGCs, and that three of these genes, CDF3, STELLAR, and
   NANOG, are located on 12p. The current study was designed to identify
   whether expression of these 12p genes were elevated in seminoma relative
   to normal testis, and to determine whether elevated expression was
   unique to seminoma.
   METHODS. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
   immunohistochemistry, were used to assess gene expression in seminoma
   samples relative to normal testis and endpoint PCR was used to identify
   the presence or absence of these genes ill breast carcinoma.
   RESULTS. GDF3 expression was increased in eight of nine seminomas
   compared with normal testis, whereas NANOG, OCT4, or both were expressed
   at the highest levels in seminoma compared with all other markers
   analyzed. In addition, the NANOG protein was expressed in the majority
   of seminoma cells. The adult meiotic germ cell markers BOULE and TEKT1
   were undetectable in seminoma, whereas the embryonic and adult germ cell
   markers DAZL and VASA were significantly reduced. Analysis of these
   markers in breast carcinoma and the MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line
   revealed that a core hESC-transcriptional Profile could be identified
   consisting of OCT4, NANOG, STELLAR, and GDP3 and that NANOG protein
   could be detected in breast carcinoma.
   CONCLUSIONS. These observations suggest that seminoma and breast
   carcinoma express a common stem cell profile and that the expression of
   DAZL and VASA in seminoma mark the germ cell origin of seminoma that is
   absent in breast carcinoma. Our findings suggest that stein cell genes
   may either play a direct role in different types of carcinoma
   progression or serve as valuable markers of tomorigenesis.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the cytotoxicity and the protection against oxidative stress
   for members of the naphthalenediol family and the known antioxidant
   epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Compounds include the
   1,2-naphthalenediol (1,2-ND), 1,4-ND, 2,3-ND, 1,8-ND, and
   1,4dipropyl-2,3-naphthalenediol (DPND). The cell line is an adherent
   clone of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12-AC). Oxidative stress was induced by
   the peroxyl radical generator AAPH. The relative order of cytotoxicity
   was 1,4-ND > 1,2-ND > DPND > 2,3-ND > 1,8-ND > EGCG, with EC50's of 15,
   40, 160, > 250, > 250, >> 250 mu M, respectively. Despite their high
   toxicity, both 1,4-ND and 1,2-ND showed narrow zones of protective
   behavior whereas DPND, 2,3-ND and 1,8-ND and especially EGCG showed an
   extended protective range. The total protection obtained for the
   combination of cells/oxidative stressor/protective compounds
   (PC12-AC/AAPH/naphthalenediols) was defined by an integrated measure,
   the cytoprotective area (CPA). We relate the observed cytotoxicity and
   CPA to the different electronic structures of the naphthalenediols,
   characterized by the first and second bond dissociation enthalpies and
   the pK(a)'s for parent (diol) and semiquinone. Since the 2,3- and
   1,8-naphthalenediols do not form quinones, their cytotoxicity, is much
   lower than for the compounds which do. Thus selected members of the
   naphthalenediol family show promise as antioxidants. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   previous two-dimensional hydraulic model failed to explain many

   constructed using the software application MODFLOW. Isotopic and
   hydrogeochemical investigations were carried out during the period 1998
   to 2002 in order to provide model data. Four water sources have been
   identified, having different isotopic (and chemical) characteristics.
   Danube water is characterized by seasonally varying 00 values: its
   unweighted mean 6180 value is -10.9\% for the years 1998 to 2002. The
   most negative delta(18)O values occur in late spring and summertime.
   Average tritium content is 20 TU. Infiltrated precipitation has
   delta(18)O values between -9.0 and -9.5\%. The average tritium content
   of the precipitation is 10 TU, and that of infiltrated precipitation
   must be close to this value and about half that of the Danube. The
   delta(18)O value of lake water is > - 9.0\%, Its stable isotope
   composition plots on the right side of the local meteoric water line on

Abstract = {{Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a progressive autoimmune disease
   characterized by the production of high levels of affinity-matured IgG
   autoantibodies to dsDNA and, possibly, visceral involvement. Pathogenic
   autoantibodies result from the activation and proliferation of
   autoreactive T and B lymphocytes stimulated by epitopes borne by
   nucleosomal histones. To inhibit the proliferation of autoreactive cells
   and abrogate the development of SLE, a novel tool, cell cycle inhibiting
   peptide therapy, was used. Thus, a peptidyl mimic of p21(WAF1/CIP1) that
   inhibits the interaction between cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and type D
   cyclins abrogated the in vitro proliferative response of T cells to
   histones and T-independent and T-dependent proliferative responses of B
   cells. The (WAF1/CIP1) mimic also abrogated the in vitro production of
   total and anti-dsDNA IgG Abs by B cells. Similarly, the p21(WAF1/CIP1)
   construct inhibited the ex vivo T and B cell proliferative responses to
   histones and decreased the numbers of activated/memory B and T spleen
   cells. The alterations in the balance of spleen cell subsets resulted
   from proapoptotic effects of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) construct on activated
   splenocytes. Finally, in vivo, four i.v. injections of the
   p21(WAF1/C1P1) mimic were sufficient to inhibit the progression of the
   lupus-like syndrome in (NZB X NZW)F-1 mice. The levels of anti-dsDNA IgG
   autoantibodies and the incidence and severity of renal involvement were
   lower in treated mice than in nontreated mice. Those observations open
   new avenues for the treatment of SLE and prompt us to evaluate the
   potential interest of peptidic therapy in human SLE.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES We investigated the relation of high ex vivo platelet
   reactivity, rapid fibrin generation, and high thrombin-induced clot
   strength to postdischarge ischemic events in patients undergoing
   percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
   BACKGROUND High platelet reactivity and rapid fibrin generation may
   affect the incidence of ischemic events after PCI. However, limited data
   is available to link these ex vivo markers to the occurrence of events.
   METHODS We measured platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
   by light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) in patients undergoing PCI (n
   = 192). Clot strength, a measure of thrombin-induced fibrin and platelet
   interactions, and the time to initial fibrin generation, a marker of
   thrombin activity, were measured by thrombelastography. The relation of
   these measurements to ischemic event occurrence was prospectively
   examined over six months.
   RESULTS A total of 100\% and 84\% of patients were on aspirin and
   clopidogrel therapy, respectively, at the time of the initial event.
   Posttreatment ADP-induced aggregation by LTA (63 +/- 12\% vs. 56 +/-
   15\%, p = 0.02) and clot strength (NIA) were higher (74 +/- 5 min vs. 65
   +/- 4 mm, p < 0.001) and time to initial fibrin generation was shorter
   (4.3 +/- 1.3 min vs. 5.9 +/- 1.5 min, p < 0.001) in patients with events
   (n = 38). The event rates in the highest quartiles of LTA and NIA were
   32\% and 58\%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS High platelet reactivity and clot strength, and rapid fibrin
   formation are novel risk factors for ischemic events after PCI. Clot
   strength is more predictive than ADP-induced platelet aggregation and
   may explain the occurrence of events despite treatment with
   cyclooxygenase-1 and P2Y(12), inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{During the involution of mammary glands, epithelial cells undergo
   apoptosis and are cleared for the next cycle of lactation. The clearance
   of apoptotic epithelial cells is mediated by neighboring epithelial
   cells and by macrophages that migrate into the mammary glands. Here, we
   report that milk fat globule EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8), a secreted
   glycoprotein that binds to apoptotic cells by recognizing
   phosphaticlylserine, was expressed by epithelial cells and macrophages
   in mammary glands and was involved in engulfment of apoptotic cells. A
   deficiency of MFG-E8 caused the accumulation of a large number of milk
   fat globules (MFGs) in the mammary ducts during involution, indicating
   that the excess MFGs were cleared by an MFG-E8-dependent mechanism. The
   MFG-E8(-/-) mice developed mammary duct ectasia with periductal
   mastitis, and the redevelopment of the mammary gland for their second
   litter was impaired. These results demonstrate that MFG-E8-mediated
   phagocytosis of apoptotic epithelial cells and IMFGs is important for
   efficient involution of mammary glands.}},

Pages = {{10243-10254}},

Abstract = {{Because each change in the evolution of a cancer is predicated on the
   effects of previous events, a full understanding of selective changes
   and their effect on tumor progression can only be understood in the
   context of appropriate initiating events. Here, we define the effect of
   pRb function inactivation in prostate epithelium on both the initiation
   of prostate cancer and the establishment of selective pressures that
   lead to diminished Pten function and tumor evolution. Using genetically
   engineered mice, we show that inactivation of the pRb family proteins
   (Rb/p107/p130) induces epithelial proliferation and apoptosis and is
   sufficient to produce prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions.
   Over time, adenocarcinomas develop in all mice with no evidence of
   neuroendocrine tumors. Apoptosis is dependent on Pten function and not
   p53, unlike other epithelial cell types tested previously. Consequently,
   Pten hemizygosity reduces apoptosis by 50\%, accelerating progression to
   adenocarcinomas with heterogeneous composition. Heterogeneity is
   associated with concurrent Pten haploinsufficiency and focal selective
   progression to complete Pten loss, which yields distinct tumor
   properties. Given that this analysis models the apparent timing of
   highly penetrant events in human prostate cancer, observed effects may
   recapitulate the natural evolution of prostate cancer development.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the role of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)
   inhibition in vascular permeability, angiogenesis, and vascular
   remodeling in tumor vessels and peritoneal lining in an athymic mouse
   model of i.p. human ovarian carcinoma.
   Experimental Design: Mice were inoculated i.p. with cells from the human
   ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR-3. Fourteen days after inoculation, mice
   were treated with or without the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, 3 days weekly
   for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, some mice were anesthetized
   and injected via the tail vein with FITC-labeled lycopersicon lectin and
   perfused through the aorta before sacrifice. The peritoneal wall and
   tumor from all mice were removed and embedded in 10\% agarose. Tumor
   sections were visualized by fluorescence microscopy.
   Results: Ascites in the LY294002-treated group (0.69 +/- 0.27 m Q was
   reduced by 72.4\% compared with the control group (2.5 +/- 1.2 mL).
   Tumor burden in the LY294002-treated group (0.62 +/- 0.32 g) was reduced
   by 47.3\% compared with the control group (1.18 +/- 0.41 g). LY294002
   inhibited peritoneal and tumor vascularization resulting in numerous
   leaky, irregular, tortuous vessels in scant, straight, relatively
   impermeable vessels.
   Conclusions: The data indicate that LY294002 inhibits ascites formation
   in our mouse model of human ovarian cancer by inhibiting tumor and
   peritoneal neovascularization as well as vascular permeability. The data
   also show that LY294002 directly inhibits vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) protein expression and release from ovarian carcinoma and
   suggest that LY294002 blocks the VEGF signaling pathway involved in
   angiogenesis and vascular permeability.}},

Abstract = {{Emphysema is one of the major pathological abnormalities associated with
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The protease/ antiprotease
   imbalance and inflammation resulting from oxidative stress have been
   attributed to the pathogenesis of emphysema. Nrf2 is believed to protect
   against oxidative tissue damage through the transcriptional activation
   of a battery of antioxidant enzymes. In this study, we investigated the
   protective role of Nrf2 in the development of emphysema using
   elastase-induced emphysema as our model system. We found that
   elastase-provoked emphysema was markedly exacerbated in Nrf2-knockout
   (KO) mice compared with wild-type mice. The severity of emphysema in
   Nrf2-KO mice correlated intimately with the degree of lung inflammation
   in the initial stage of elastase treatment. The highly inducible
   expression of antioxidant and antiprotease genes observed in wild-type
   alveolar macrophages was significantly attenuated in the lungs of
   Nrf2-KO mice. Interestingly, transplantation of wild-type bone marrow
   cells into Nrf2-KO mice retarded the development of initial lung
   inflammation and subsequent emphysema, and this improvement correlated
   well with the appearance of macrophages expressing Nrf2-regulated
   antiprotease and antioxidant genes. Thus, Nrf2 appears to exert its
   protective effects through the transcriptional activation of
   antiprotease and antioxidant genes in alveolar macrophages.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was designed to investigate the effects of two main
   constituents of green tea, (-)-epigallocatechin-3gallate (EGCG) and
   caffeine, on intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(min/+) mice, a recognized
   mouse model for human intestinal cancer, and to elucidate possible
   mechanisms involved in the inhibitory action of the active constituent.
   We found that p.o. administration of EGCG at doses of 0.08\% or 0.16\%
   in drinking fluid significantly decreased small intestinal tumor
   formation by 37\% or 47\%, respectively, whereas caffeine at a dose of
   0.044\% in drinking fluid had no inhibitory activity against intestinal
   tumorigenesis. In another experiment, small intestinal tumorigenesis was
   inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by p.o. administration of EGCG in a
   dose range of 0.02\% to 0.32\%. P.o. administration of EGCG resulted in
   increased levels of E-cadherin and decreased levels of nuclear
   P-catenin, c-Myc, phospho-Akt, and phospho-extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/ 2) in small intestinal tumors.
   Treatment of HT29 human colon cancer cells with EGCG (12.5 or 20 mu
   mol/L at different times) also increased protein levels of E-cadherin by
   27\% to 58\%, induced the translocation of beta-catenin from nucleus to
   cytoplasm and plasma membrane, and decreased c-Myc and cyclin D1 (20 mu
   mol/l, EGCG for 24 hours). These results indicate that EGCG effectively
   inhibited intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(min/+) mice, possibly through
   the attenuation of the carcinogenic events, which include aberrant
   nuclear beta-catenin and activated Akt and ERK signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction by regression plays an important role in intelligent systems.
   To construct a regression model for fuzzy numbers, this paper decomposes
   a fuzzy number into two parts: the position and fuzziness. The former is
   represented by the elements with membership value l and the latter by
   the entropy of the fuzzy number; both have crisp values. The
   conventional regression analysis is applied to find the relationship
   between the position (and entropy) of the fuzzy response variable and
   that of the fuzzy explanatory variables. Given a set of fuzzy
   explanatory variables, the position and entropy of the estimated fuzzy
   responses are calculated from the regression model. Via the one-to-one
   correspondence between a fuzzy number and its entropy, the estimated
   fuzzy response is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process and progresses through
   characteristic morphologic stages. We have shown previously that
   chronically injecting bone-marrow-derived vascular progenitor cells can
   effect arterial repair. This repair capacity depends on the age of the
   injected marrow cells, suggesting a progressive decline in progenitor
   cell function. We hypothesized that the progression of atherosclerosis
   coincides with the deteriorating repair capacity of the bone marrow.
   Here, we ascribe patterns of gene expression that accurately and
   reproducibly identify specific disease states in murine atherosclerosis.
   We then use these expression patterns to determine the point in the
   disease process at which the repair of arteries by competent bone marrow
   cells ceases to be efficient. We show that the loss of the molecular
   signature for competent repair is concurrent with the initiation of
   atherosclerotic lesions. This work provides a previously unreported
   comprehensive molecular data set using broad-based analysis that links
   the loss of successful repair with the progression of a chronic illness.}},

Abstract = {{Late onset cerebellar ataxia can be caused by several genetic mutations
   but a large percentage of patients remain undiagnosed. Thirty-eight
   patients with onset of slowly progressive, pure cerebellar ataxia >= 40
   years-of-age were identified from a large ataxia database. Their
   clinical findings and quantitative oculomotor tests were reviewed; all
   were screened for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA8, SCA14, and the Fragile X
   premutation (FMR1). All 47 exons of CACNA1A were screened for mutations.
   Genetic analysis uncovered a mutation in I I patients. The SCA6 mutation
   was present in 8 patients (repeats 22-23). Three additional genetic
   mutations were found: SCA1 (42 repeats), SCA3 (66 repeats), and SCA8
   (121 repeats). Patients without identified genetic mutations were
   characterized by 1) a later age of onset, 2) truncal without extremity
   ataxia, 3) and down beat nystagmus. Although only a third of these
   idiopathic late onset ataxia patients had a positive family history,
   this homogeneous syndrome probably represents a yet to be identified
   genetic disorder. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The neonatal period is critical for central nervous system (CNS)
   development. Recent studies have shown that this basic neurobiological
   principle also applies to the neural circuits regulating respiratory
   activity as exposure to excessive or insufficient chemosensory stimuli
   during early life can have long-lasting consequences on the performance
   of this vital system. Although the tactile, olfactory, and auditory
   stimuli that the mother provides to her offspring during the neonatal
   period are not directly relevant to respiratory homeostasis, they likely
   contribute to respiratory control development. This review outlines the
   rationale for the link between maternal stimuli and programming of the
   hypoxic ventilatory response during early life, and presents recent
   results obtained in rats indicating that experimental disruption of
   mother-pup interaction during this critical period elicits significant
   phenotypic plasticity of the hypoxic ventilatory response. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Gilbert-type deltas are commonly characterised by steep foreset bedding.
   Changes in the foreset characteristics such as grain size, grading,
   alternating sand and gravel are often interpreted as records of changes
   of base level or sediment input due to diurnal, seasonal or climatic
   forcing. To aid such interpretations, an important question is to what
   extent cyclicity in the foreset characteristics can be explained by
   autogenic processes rather than exogenic forcing. Experimental deltas
   were generated with gravelly sand under constant boundary conditions and
   a varying width-depth ratio of the feeder system. The foresets of the
   narrow feeder system are regular and show gradual upward fining. The
   foresets of the wide feeder system, in contrast, show quasi-cyclic
   patterns of coarsening and fining during the delta progradation. The
   cyclicity is caused by the emergence of a channelised point feeder
   system with migrating gravel side bars, which distributes the sand and
   gravel laterally in a non-uniform manner. This spectacular change of
   foreset architecture is fully explained by the autogenic response of the
   feeder system to the width. These experiments are contrasted with
   experiments and data from literature in the framework of the delta
   classification of Postma.}},

   indicate that similar genetic mechanisms control petal development
   across diverse taxa, there is also considerable evidence for variability
   in petal identity programs, likely due to a number of factors. These
   points are illustrated through a review of our current knowledge on the
   subject, integrating phylogenetic, morphological, and genetic studies.
   Comparative studies of petal identity highlight the complex nature of
   homology in plants and stand as a cautionary tale for the interpretation
   of gene expression data.}},

   Importance of the balance between donor T-cell number and the intensity

Abstract = {{Background. Animal allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models
   with nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens have so far required
   irradiation or antibodies in addition to immunosuppressive drugs for
   engraftment. Moreover, although it is known that the balance between
   donor T-cell number and the dose of immunosuppressive drugs would be
   critical for engraftment, it has not been experimentally clarified in a
   nonmyeloablative regimen.
   Methods. We used C57BL/6 mice as donors and DBA/2 mice as recipients
   with a nonmyeloablative regimen including fludarabine (Flu) and
   cyclophosphamide (CPA) without irradiation or antibodies. To determine
   the adequate doses, we injected recipients with various doses of Flu and
   CPA, and 2 X 107 bone marrow cells (BMC) and 5 X 107 splenocytes (SC).
   Furthermore, using T-cell-depleted BMC and enriched T cells, we
   investigated the balance between donor T-cell number and the dose of
   Flu.
   Results. Doses of Flu at 150 mg/kg/dayx6 and CPA at 150 mg/kg/dayx2 were
   most appropriate for engraftment with low mortality. All mice
   appropriately pretreated and transplanted with both BMC and SC exhibited
   complete donor chimeras. Donor cell engraftment was not enhanced by any
   increase of BMC transplanted, and dose escalation of donor T cells but
   not BMC led to the reduction of Flu dose required for engraftment of
   donor cells.
   Conclusions. We have established a murine nonmyeloablative BMT model in
   a fully MHC-mis matched combination for donor cell engraftment with
   complete donor chimerism. Simultaneously, we have quantitatively
   demonstrated that the balance between donor T-cell number and the dose
   of immunosuppressive drugs is critical or stable engraftment.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a polling system of two queues served by a single server that
   visits the queues in cyclic order. The polling discipline in each queue

   assume that the arrival times in each queue form a Poisson process and
   that the service times form sequences of independent and identically
   distributed random variables, except for the service distribution of the
   first customer who is served at each polling instant (the time in which
   the server moves from one queue to the other one), The sufficient and
   necessary conditions for the ergodicity of such polling system are
   established as well as the stationary distribution for the
   continuous-time process describing the state of the system. The proofs
   rely on the combination of three embedded processes that were previously
   used in the literature. An important result is that rho = 1 can imply
   ergodicity in one specific case, where rho is the typical traffic
   intensity for polling systems, and rho < 1 is the classical

Abstract = {{This study presents an interval-parameter fuzzy two-stage stochastic
   programming (IFTSP) method for the planning of
   water-resources-management systems under uncertainty. The model is
   derived by incorporating the concepts of interval-parameter and fuzzy
   programming techniques within a two-stage stochastic optimization
   framework. The approach has two major advantages in comparison to other
   optimization techniques, Firstly, the IFTSP method can incorporate
   pre-defined water policies directly into its optimization process and,
   secondly, it can readily integrate inherent system uncertainties
   expressed not only as possibility and probability distributions but also
   as discrete intervals directly into its solution procedure. The IFTSP
   process is applied to,in earlier case study of regional water resources
   management and it is demonstrated how the method efficiently produces
   stable solution,, together with different risk levels of violating
   pre-established allocation criteria. In addition, a variety of decision
   alternatives are generated under different combinations of water

Abstract = {{We report on Adaptive Optics observations of the satellite of Asteroid
   121 Hermione with the ESO-Paranal UT4 VLT and the Keck AO telescopes.
   The binary system, belonging to the Cybele family, was observed during
   two observing campaigns in January 2003 and January 2004 aiming to
   confirm its trajectory and accurately determine its orbital elements. A
   precessing Keplerian model was used to describe the motion of S/2002
   (121) 1. We find that the satellite of Hermione revolves at a = 768 +/-
   11 km from the primary in P = 2.582 +/- 10.002 days with a roughly
   circular and prograde orbit (e = 0.001 +/- 0.001, i = 3 +/- 2 degrees
   w.r.t. equator primary). These extensive astrometric measurements enable
   us to determine the mass of Hermione to be 0.54 +/- 0.03 x 10(19) kg and
   its pole solution (lambda(0) = 1.5 degrees +/- 2.00, beta(0) = 10
   degrees +/- 2.0 in ecliptic J2000). Additional Keck AO observations
   taken close to the asteroid opposition in December 2003 give us direct
   insight into the structure of the primary which presents a bilobated
   shape. Since the angular resolution is limited to the theoretical
   angular resolution of the telescope (43 mas corresponding to a spatial
   resolution of 80 km), two shape models (called snowman and peanut) are
   proposed based on the images which were deconvolved with MISTRAL
   deconvolution process. Assuming a purely synchronous orbit and knowing
   the mass of the primary, the peanut shape composed of two separated
   components is quite unlikely. Additionally the J(2) calculated from the
   analysis of the secondary orbit is not in agreement with the peanut
   model, but close to the snowman shape. The bulk density of the primary
   as derived from the observed size of the snowman shape is estimated to
   rho similar to 1.8 +/- 0.2 g/cm(3) implying a porosity similar to 14\%
   for this C-type asteroid, corresponding to a fractured asteroid.
   Considering the IRAS diameter, the density is lower (p = 1.1 +/- 0.3
   g/cm(3)) leading to a high porosity (p = 30-60\%) with a nominal value
   of p = 48\%, which indicates a completely loose rubble-pile structure
   for the primary. Further work is necessary to better constrain the size,
   shape, and then internal structure of Hermione's primary. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Let (M, g) be a globally symmetric space of noncompact type, of

   analyze Delta and the resolvent (Delta - sigma)(-1); this has origins in
   quantum N-body scattering, but is independent of the `classical' theory
   of spherical functions, and is analytically much more robust. We expect
   that, suitably modified, it will generalize to locally symmetric spaces
   of arbitrary rank. As an illustration of this method, we prove the
   existence of a meromorphic continuation of the resolvent across the
   continuous spectrum to a Riemann surface multiply covering the plane. We
   also show how this continuation may be deduced using the theory of
   spherical functions. In summary, this paper establishes a long-suspected

Abstract = {{The origin of evolutionary novelties is a central topic in evolutionary
   developmental biology (evo-devo) studies. In any new feature, there is a
   conserved component that is either structural or related to the
   underlying genetic control, but it is not always obvious what is really
   new and what is conserved. Nevertheless, disentangling this blending of
   old and new features is basic to understanding mechanisms of
   evolutionary change. The origin of arthropod appendages illustrates the
   complexity in tracing the origin of evolutionary novelties. At the base
   of the lineage, the main body axis was already segmented and
   antero-posteriorly patterned, and the genetic tool kit required to form
   lateral outgrowths was already available. The novelty was possibly the
   developmental decision to ``read{''} the available axial information and
   to exploit it for differentiating segmentally patterned and axially
   segmented appendages. Some important novelties bridge the gap between
   what have been traditionally distinguished as systemic and local
   changes. For example, the origin of the body cavities evolved by several
   animal groups may have been initiated by simple changes in cell-to-cell
   adhesive properties. Any possible change in an existing ontogenetic
   pathway has the potential to generate novelties.}},

Abstract = {{The current study was undertaken to fabricate a small micro-electrode
   on-chip to rapidly detect and quantify human CD4(+) cells in a minimal
   volume of blood through impedance measurements made with simple
   electronics that could be battery operated implemented in a hand held
   device. The micro-electrode surface was non-covalently modified
   sequentially by incubation with solutions of protein G', human albumin,
   monoclonal mouse anti-human CD4, and mouse IgG. The anti-human CD4
   antibody served as the recognition and capture molecule for CD4(+) cells
   present in human blood. The binding of these biomolecules to the
   micro-electrodes was verified by impedance and cyclic voltarnmetry
   measurements. An increase in impedance was detected for each layer of
   protein adsorbed onto the micro-electrode surface. This process was
   shown to be highly repeatable. Increased impedance was measured when
   CD4(+) cells were captured on the micro-electrode, and the impedance
   also increased as the number of captured cells increased. Fluorescence
   microscopy of captured cells immunolabeled with anti-human CD4, CD8, and
   CD19 antibodies, and the nuclear label DAPI, confirmed that only CD4(+)
   cells were captured. The results were highly dependent on the specimen
   preparation method used. We conclude that the on-chip capture system can
   efficiently quantify the number of CD4(+) cells. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{MHC class I proteins mediate a variety of functions in antiviral
   defense. In humans and mice, three MHC class I loci each contribute one
   or two alleles and each can present a wide variety of peptide Ags. In
   contrast, many lower vertebrates appear to use a single NMC class I
   locus. Previously we showed that a single locus was predominantly
   expressed in the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and that locus was
   adjacent to the polymorphic transporter for the Ag-processing (TAP2)
   gene. Characterization of a genomic clone from the same duck now allows
   us to compare genes to account for their differential expression. The
   clone carried five MHC class I genes and the TAP genes in the following
   gene order: TAP1, TAP2, UAA, UBA, UCA, UDA, and UEA. We designated the
   predominantly expressed gene UAA. Transcripts corresponding to the UDA
   locus were expressed at a low level. No transcripts were found for three
   loci, UBA, UCA, and UEA. UBA had a deletion within the promoter
   sequences. UCA carried a stop codon in-frame. UEA did not have a
   polyadenylation signal sequence. All sequences differed primarily in
   peptide-binding pockets and otherwise had the hallmarks of classical MHC
   class I alleles. Despite the presence of additional genes in the genome,
   the duck expresses predominantly one MHC class I gene. The limitation to
   one expressed NMC class I gene may have functional consequences for the
   ability of ducks to eliminate viral pathogens, such as influenza.}},

Abstract = {{AutoDock is a small-molecule docking program that uses an energy
   function to score docked ligands. Here AutoDock's grid-based method for
   energy evaluation was exploited to evaluate the force exerted by
   Fusarium oxysporum Cel7B on the atoms of docked cellooligosaccharides
   and a thiooligosaccharide substrate analog. Coupled with the interaction
   energies evaluated for each docked ligand, these forces give insight
   into the dynamics of the ligand in the active site, and help to
   elucidate the relative importance of specific enzyme-substrate
   interactions in stabilizing the substrate transition-state conformation.
   The processive force on the docked substrate in the F. oxysporum Cel7B
   active site is less than half of that on the docked substrate in the
   Hypocrea jecorina Cel7A active site. Hydrogen bonding interactions of
   the enzyme with the C2 hydroxyl group of the glucosyl residue in subsite
   -2 and with the C3 hydroxyl group of the glucosyl residue in subsite +1
   are the most significant in stabilizing the distorted(1,4)B
   transition-state conformation of the glucosyl residue in subsite -1. The

Abstract = {{Background - Pulmonary veins ( PVs) can be completely isolated with
   continuous circular lesions ( CCLs) around the ipsilateral PVs. However,
   electrophysiological findings have not been described in detail during
   ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation ( AF).
   Methods and Results - Forty patients with symptomatic persistent AF
   underwent complete isolation of the right-sided and left-sided
   ipsilateral PVs guided by 3D mapping and double Lasso technique during
   AF. Irrigated ablation was initially performed in the right-sided CCLs
   and subsequently in the left-sided CCLs. After complete isolation of
   both lateral PVs, stable sinus rhythm was achieved after AF termination
   in 12 patients; AF persisted and required cardioversion in 18 patients.
   In the remaining 10 patients, AF changed to left macroreentrant atrial
   tachycardia in 6 and common-type atrial flutter in 4 patients. All
   atrial tachycardias were successfully terminated during the procedure.
   Atrial tachyarrhythmias recurred in 15 of 40 patients at a median of 4
   days after the initial ablation. A repeat ablation was performed at a
   median of 35 days after the initial procedure in 14 patients. During the
   repeat study, recovered PV conduction was found in 13 patients and
   successfully abolished by focal ablation of the conduction gap of the
   previous CCLs. After a mean of 8 +/- 2 months of follow-up, 38 ( 95\%)
   of the 40 patients were free of AF.
   Conclusions - In patients with persistent AF, CCLs can result in either
   AF termination or conversion to macroreentrant atrial tachycardia in
   55\% of the patients. In addition, recovered PV conduction after the
   initial procedure is a dominant finding in recurrent atrial
   tachyarrhythmias and can be successfully abolished.}},

Abstract = {{A dual-channel fiber-optic sensor based on surface plasmon resonance
   (SPR) for self-referencing refractive-index measurements has been
   proposed. Most applications of fiber-optic SPR sensors are designed to
   measure the refractive index of a liquid or gas sample by measuring the
   signal from a single surface, the sensitivity and stability of which is
   easily affected by the fluctuation of external environmental conditions.
   We have designed a dual-channel fiber-optic surface sensor with two
   independent SPR signals from two areas of the same probe. A prototype
   sensor was fabricated and characterized. The preliminary experimental
   results demonstrate the characteristic responses of both SPR signals
   from two channels that independently correspond to the refractive index
   changes in the liquid samples with which they are in contact. The design
   could be extended to a multichannel sensor with further developments.
   The experimental results confirmed that one channel can be used as a
   reference sensor that could compensate for unexpected changes in bulk
   refraction or temperature and develop this sensor as a practicable
   high-sensitivity biosensing device. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Aldosterone is involved in a variety of pathophysiological processes
   that ultimately cause cardiovascular diseases. Despite this, the
   physiological role of aldosterone in heart function remains elusive. We
   took advantage of transgenic mouse models characterized by a renal
   salt-losing (SL) or salt-retaining (SR) phenotype, thus exhibiting
   chronically high or low plasma aldosterone levels, respectively, to
   investigate the chronic effects of aldosterone in cardiomyocytes devoid
   of pathology. On a diet containing normal levels of salt, these animals
   do not develop any evidence of cardiovascular disease. Using the whole
   cell patch-clamp technique on freshly isolated adult ventricular
   cardiomyocytes, we observed that the amplitude of L-type Ca2+ currents
   (I-Ca) correlates with plasma aldosterone levels. Larger values of I-Ca
   are associated with high aldosterone concentrations in SL models,
   whereas smaller values Of I-Ca were observed in the SR model. Neither
   the time- nor the voltage-dependent properties Of I-Ca varied
   measurably. In parallel, we determined whether modulation Of I-Ca by
   blood concentration of aldosterone has a major physiological impact on
   the excitation-contraction coupling of the cardiomyocytes. Action
   potential duration, {[}Ca2+](i) transient amplitude and contraction are
   increased in the SL model and decreased in the SR model. In conclusion,
   we demonstrate that the blood concentration of aldosterone exerts
   chronic regulation Of I-Ca in mouse cardiomyocytes. This regulation has
   important consequences for excitation-contraction coupling and,
   potentially, for other Ca2+-regulated functions in cardiornyocytes.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work has shown that cyclin D1 expression is required for neu-
   and ras-induced, but not wnt- or c-myc-induced, breast tumorigenesis in
   mice. Although cyclin D1 binds and activates cyclin-dependent kinase 4
   (Cdk4), thereby mediating activation of a program of E2F-dependent gene
   expression, it has been suggested that the oncogenic activities of
   cyclin D1 are independent of Cdk4. To determine whether Cdk4 expression
   is required for breast tumorigenesis in mice, we have generated compound
   mice ectopically expressing the neu or wnt oncogenes in the mammary
   glands of wild-type and Cdk4-/- mice. Our results show that Cdk4
   expression is required for efficient neu-induced tumorigenesis but is
   dispensable for wnt-induced breast tumorigenesis. In contrast to results
   previously observed in the mammary glands of cyclin D1-/- virgin
   females, our results show defects in mammary gland development in
   Cdk4-/- virgin females, suggesting differences in compensatory
   mechanisms in the absence of either subunit of the cyclin D1/Cdk4
   complex. These results suggest that drugs targeted to inhibit Cdk4
   activities could be developed to specifically treat certain breast
   tumors as Cdk4 is not essential for viability.}},

Abstract = {{Conjugated polymers in the form of thin films play an important role in
   the field of materials science due to their interesting properties.
   Polymer thin films find extensive applications in the fabrication of
   devices, such as light emitting devices, rechargeable batteries, super
   capacitors, and are used as intermetallic dielectrics and EMI
   shieldings. Polymer thin films prepared by plasma-polymerization are
   highly cross-linked, pinhole free, and their permittivity lie in the
   ultra low k-regime. Electronic and photonic applications of
   plasma-polymerized thin films attracted the attention of various
   researchers. Modification of polymer thin films by swift heavy ions is
   well established and ion irradiation of polymers can induce irreversible
   changes in their structural, electrical, and optical properties.
   Polyaniline and polyfurfural thin films prepared by RF
   plasma-polymerization were irradiated with 92 MeV silicon ions for
   various fluences of 1x10(11) ions cm(-2), 1x10(12) ions cm(-2), and
   1x10(13) ions cm(-2). FTIR have been recorded on the pristine and
   silicon ion irradiated polymer thin films for structural evaluation.
   Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded for RF plasma-polymerized
   thin film samples before and after irradiation. In this paper the effect
   of swift heavy ions on the structural and photoluminescence spectra of
   plasma-polymerized thin films are investigated. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Erosions and ulcerations of the intestinal epithelium are hallmarks of
   inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Intestinal epithelial cell migration
   (restitution) and proliferation are pivotal mechanisms for healing of
   epithelial defects after mucosal injury. In addition, the rate of
   apoptosis of epithelial cells may modulate intestinal wound healing.
   The purine antagonists azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)
   are widely used drugs in the treatment of IBD. In the present study, the
   hitherto unknown effects of AZA as well as its metabolites 6-MP and
   6-thioguanine (6-TG) on repair mechanisms and apoptosis of intestinal
   epithelia were analysed.
   Intestinal epithelial cell lines (human Caco-2, T-84 and HT-29 cells,
   rat IEC-6 cells) were incubated with AZA, 6-MP or 6-TG for 24 h (final
   concentrations 0.1-10 mu M). Migration of Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells was
   analysed by in vitro restitution assays. Caco-2 and IEC-6 cell
   proliferation was evaluated by measurement of {[}H-3]thymidine
   incorporation into DNA. Apoptosis of Caco-2, T-84, HT-29 and IEC-6 cells
   was assessed by histone ELISA,
   4'6'diamidino-2'phenylindole-dihydrochloride staining as well as flow
   cytometric analysis of Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells.
   Cell cycle progression was evaluated by PI staining and flow cytometry.
   Epithelial restitution was not significantly affected by any of the
   substances tested. However, proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells
   was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (maximal effect 92\%) by AZA,
   6-MP as well as 6-TG. In HT-29 cells, purine antagonist-effected
   inhibition of cell proliferation was explained by a cell cycle arrest in
   the G2 phase. In contrast, AZA, 6-MP and 6-TG induced no cell cycle
   arrest in Caco-2, T-84 and IEC-6 cells. AZA, 6-MP as well as 6-TG
   induced apoptosis in the non-transformed IEC-6 cell line but not in
   human Caco-2, T-84 and HT-29 cells.
   In summary, AZA and its metabolites exert no significant effect on
   intestinal epithelial restitution. However, they profoundly inhibit
   intestinal epithelial cell growth via various mechanisms: they cause a
   G2 cell cycle arrest in HT-29 cells, induce apoptosis in TEC-6 cells and
   dose-dependently inhibit intestinal epithelial proliferation. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Background. The inflammation response is modulated by the elaborated
   chemokine-chemokine receptor system, which also plays an important role
   in the development of acute rejection (AR). In this study, we
   hypothesized that functional genetic variants of some of these
   modulatory proteins might influence the outcome of AR.
   Methods. In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of heart transplanted
   patients (n=158), we examined eight polymorphisms in four genes
   implicated in this inflammatory process: RANTES, CCR5, CCR2 and
   CX(3)CR1. On the basis of timing occurrence, AR episodes (grade >= 3A)
   were classified in ``early{''} (0-3 months posttransplantation; EAR) or
   ``late{''} outcomes (4-12 months posttransplantation; LAR).
   Results. The incidences of EAR and LAR were 57.6\% and 41\%,
   respectively. Number of LAR episodes was significantly higher in
   subjects that have already experienced one or more EAR episodes, as
   compared to subjects that had no EAR (median {[}25\%-75\%]: 4 (3-5) vs.
   I {[}1-2.5] respectively; P < 0.0001). Statistical univariate analysis
   showed that none of the mentioned polymorphisms were correlated with EAR
   or LAR. However, allele-allele association analysis showed that subjects
   carrying both the CX3CRI 2491 allele and CCR5 No-E haplotypes were
   significantly at lower risk of experiencing EAR (OR=0.2
   {[}95\%-CI=0.1-0.51, P=0.001). In contrast subjects carrying both the
   CCR5 E haplotype and the RANTES -403A allele were significantly at
   higher risk to develop LAR (OR=8.1 {[}95\%-CI=2.3-28.7], P=0.002).
   Conclusions. This exploratory study in heart transplantation suggests
   that the outcomes of EAR and LAR episodes may be influenced by genetic
   variant interactions such as ``CX3CRI 2491{*}CCR5 No-E{''} and ``CCR5
   E{*}RANTES -403A.{''}}},

Abstract = {{Background - Few studies have examined whether hemostatic markers
   contribute to risk of coronary disease and ischemic stroke independently
   of conventional risk factors. This study examines 11 hemostatic markers
   that reflect different aspects of the coagulation process to determine
   which have prognostic value after accounting for conventional risk
   factors.
   Methods and Results - A total of 2398 men aged 49 to 65 years were
   examined in 1984 to 1988, and the majority gave a fasting blood sample
   for assay of lipids and hemostatic markers. Men were followed up for a
   median of 13 years, and cardiovascular disease ( CVD) events were
   recorded. There were 486 CVD events in total, 353 with prospective
   coronary disease and 133 with prospective ischemic stroke. On
   univariable analysis, fibrinogen, low activated protein C ratio,
   D-dimer, tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA), and plasminogen activator
   inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1) were associated significantly with risk of CVD. On
   multivariable analyses with conventional risk factors forced into the
   proportional hazards model, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and PAI-1 were
   significantly associated with risk of CVD, whereas factor VIIc showed an
   inverse association ( P = 0.001). In a model that contained the
   conventional risk factors, the hazard ratio for subsequent CVD in the
   top third of the distribution of predicted risk relative to the bottom
   third was 2.7 for subjects without preexisting CVD. This ratio increased
   to 3.7 for the model that also contained the 4 hemostatic factors.
   Conclusions - Fibrinogen, D-dimer, PAI-1 activity, and factor VIIc each
   has potential to increase the prediction of coronary disease/ischemic
   stroke in middle-aged men, in addition to conventional risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{The highly conserved, 300-kDa cylindrical protease ClpP is an important
   component of the cellular protein quality machinery. It consists of 14
   subunits arranged into two heptameric rings that enclose a large chamber
   containing the protease active sites. ClpP associates with ClpX and ClpA
   ATPases that unfold and translocate substrates into the protease
   catalytic chamber through axial pores located at both ends of the ClpP
   cylinder. Although the pathway of substrate delivery is well
   established, the pathway of product release is unknown. Here, we use
   recently developed transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)
   of methyl groups to show that the interface between the heptameric rings
   exchanges between two structurally distinct conformations. The
   conformational exchange process has been quantified by magnetization
   exchange and methyl TROSY relaxation dispersion experiments recorded
   between 0.5 degrees C and 40 degrees C, so that the thermodynamic
   properties for the transition could be obtained. Restriction of the
   observed motional freedom in ClpP through the introduction of a cysteine
   linkage results in a protease where substrate release becomes
   significantly slowed relative to the rate observed in the reduced
   enzyme, suggesting that the observed motions lead to the formation of
   transient side pores that may play an important role in product release.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of stable water isotopes provides valuable insight into
   runoff generation processes in subarctic wetland regions of the
   Mackenzie River basin, a major freshwater contributor to the Arctic
   Ocean and the focus of intensive hydrological research as part of
   Canada's contribution to the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment
   (GEWEX). This article describes a streamflow hydrograph separation
   analysis carried out over three complete annual cycles (1997-1999) for
   five subarctic catchments ranging in size from 202 to 2050 km(2)
   situated near the confluence of the Liard and Mackenzie rivers. This
   heterogeneous landscape, characterized by extensive wetlands (fen and
   bog), shallow lakes and widespread discontinuous permafrost, is
   representative of vast flow-contributing areas of the upper Mackenzie
   Valley, and is suspected to be highly sensitive to climate variability
   and change. We document seasonal patterns and interannual variability in
   the isotopic composition of local streamflow, attributable to mixing of
   three distinctly labelled flow sources, namely groundwater, surface
   water plus rain, and direct snowmelt, and apply these isotopic signals
   to partition sources and their temporal variability. Although
   groundwater input is the dominant and most persistent streamflow source
   in all five catchments throughout the year, direct snowmelt runoff via
   surface and shallow subsurface pathways (during spring freshet) and
   surface waters from lakes and wetlands situated in low-lying areas of
   the basins (during summer and fall) are also significant seasonal
   contributors. Catchment-specific differences are also apparent,
   particularly in the generation of snowmelt runoff, which is more
   attenuated in fen-dominated than in bog-dominated catchments. The data
   set additionally reveals notable interannual variability in snow isotope
   signatures and snow water equivalent, apparently enhanced by the 1998 El
   Nino event. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Time-dependent activation of matrix metalloproteinases
   (MMPs) after myocardial infarction (MI) contributes to adverse left
   ventricular (LV) remodeling; however, noninvasive methods to monitor
   this process serially are needed.
   Methods and Results: MMP-targeted radiotracers were developed that
   displayed selective binding kinetics to the active MMP catalytic domain.
   Initial nonimaging studies were performed with a In-111-labeled
   MMP-targeted radiotracer (In-111-RP782) and negative control compound
   (In-111-RP788) in control mice (Ctrl) and in mice 1 week after
   surgically induced MI. Localization of In-111-RP782 was demonstrated
   within the MI by microautoradiography. A 334 +/- 44\% increase (P <
   0.001 versus Ctrl) in relative retention of In-111-RP782 was confirmed
   by gamma well counting of myocardium. Subsequent high-resolution
   dual-isotope planar and hybrid micro-single-photon emission computed
   tomography/CT imaging studies with an analogous Tc-99m-labeled
   MMP-targeted radiotracer (Tc-99m-RP805) and Tl-201 demonstrated
   favorable biodistribution and clearance kinetics of Tc-99m-RP805 for in
   vivo cardiac imaging, with robust retention 1 to 3 weeks after MI in
   regions of decreased 201Tl perfusion. Gamma well counting yielded a
   similar approximate to 300\% increase in relative myocardial retention
   of Tc-99m-RP805 in MI regions (Ctrl, 102 +/- 9\%; 1 week, 351 +/- 77\%;
   2 weeks, 291 +/- 45\%; 3 weeks, 292 +/- 41\%; P < 0.05 versus Ctrl).
   Myocardial uptake in the MI region was also significantly increased
   approximate to 5-fold when expressed as percentage injected dose per
   gram tissue. There was also a significant 2-fold increase in myocardial
   activity in remote regions relative to control mice, suggesting
   activation of MMPs in regions remote from the MI.
   Conclusions: This novel noninvasive targeted MMP radiotracer imaging
   approach holds significant diagnostic potential for in vivo localization
   of MMP activation and tracking of MMP-mediated post-MI remodeling.}},

Abstract = {{P2X7 receptors are ATP-gated ion channels and play important roles in
   microglial functions in the brain. Activation of P2X7 receptors by ATP
   or its agonist BzATP induces Ca2+ influx from extracellular space,
   followed by the formation of non-selective membrane pores that is
   permeable to larger molecules, such as fluorescent dye. To determine
   whether phospholipase C (PLC) is involved in the activation of P2X7
   receptors in microglial cells, U73122, a specific inhibitor of PLC, and
   its inactive analogue U73343 were examined on ATP and BzATP-induced
   channel and pore formation in an immortalized C57BL/6 mouse microglial
   cell line (MG6-1). ATP induced both a transient and a sustained increase
   in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ({[}Ca2+](i)) in MG6-1 cells,
   whereas BzATP evoked only a sustained increase. U73122, but not U73343,
   inhibited the transient {[}Ca2+](i) increase involving Ca2+ release from
   intracellular stores through PLC activation. In contrast, both U73122
   and U73343 inhibited the sustained {[}Ca2+](i) increase either prior or
   after the activation of P2X7 receptor channels by ATP and BzATP. In
   addition, these U-compounds inhibited the influx of ethidium, bromide
   induced by ATP and BzATP, suggesting possible PLC-independent blockage
   of the process of P2X7-associated channel and pore formations by
   U-compounds in C57BL/6 mouse microglial cells. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Study Design. Results of C4-C7 laminoplasty with C3 laminectomy and
   C3-C7 laminoplasty were compared.
   Objectives. To clarify prospectively whether the modified laminoplasty
   preserving the semispinalis cervicis inserted into C2 could reduce the
   axial symptoms compared with conventional laminoplasty reattaching the
   muscle to C2.
   Summary of Background Data. Intraoperative damage of the semispinalis
   cervicis is relevant to the development of axial symptoms after
   laminoplasty. In C3-C7 laminoplasty, however, it is difficult to
   preserve the muscle insertion into C2 while opening the C3 lamina.
   Methods. The axial symptoms of 40 patients (Group A) with C4-C7
   laminoplasty with C3 laminectomy were compared with those of 16 patients
   (Group B) with C3-C7 laminoplasty. The cross-sectional areas of the
   cervical posterior muscles were measured on magnetic resonance images.
   Results. The number of patients with no postoperative axial symptoms
   increased (P = 0.035) from 19\% to 52.5\%, and the number of patients
   whose symptoms worsened after surgery decreased (P = 0.020) from 50\% to
   17.5\%. The average atrophy rate of cross-sectional area was smaller (P
   < 0.001) in Group A (2.4\%) than in Group B (10.8\%).
   Conclusions. This method was less invasive to the cervical posterior
   muscles than C3-C7 laminoplasty. This is an effective procedure for
   preventing postoperative axial symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{alpha v beta 3 or alpha v beta 5 integrins are widely expressed on blood
   and endothelial cells. Inhibition of the functions of these integrins
   has been reported to suppress neovascularization and tumor growth,
   suggesting that they may be critical modulators of angiogenesis.
   However, mice lacking these integrins exhibit extensive angiogenesis.
   Tumors arising from s.c. injections of tumor cells into mice lacking one
   or both integrins show enhanced tumor growth compared with growth in
   control mice due to both increased angiogenesis and to altered innate
   immune response. Other data suggest additional roles for these
   integrins, on either platelets or the tumor cells themselves, in
   enhancing tumor progression and metastasis. Here, we investigate the
   involvement of beta 3 and beta 5 integrins in the development and
   progression of mammary carcinomas. We intercrossed mouse mammary tumor
   virus (MMTV)-c-neu transgenic mice with beta 3 or beta 5 or beta 3 beta
   5 integrin-deficient mice and observed that multiple, large mammary
   tumors developed in 100\% of mice on all genetic backgrounds. A
   statistically significant earlier onset of tumor growth was observed in
   the MNITV-c-neu/beta 3 beta 5 integrin-null females compared with
   control mice. No major differences were observed in tumor size or
   number, vessel number or vessel structure and lung metastases were
   observed with similar frequency and size in all strains. MMTV-c-neu/beta
   3 beta 5 integrin-null mice had higher numbers of mammary acini, which
   may account for the earlier onset of tumors in this strain. These data
   indicate that alpha v beta 3 or alpha v beta 5 integrins are not
   essential for tumor growth and progression, although they might play
   some role in mammary gland development.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between malignant tumors and the host immune system shape
   the course of cancer progression. The molecular basis of such
   interactions is the subject of immense interest. Proinflammatory
   cytokines produced by macrophages are critical mediators of immune
   responses that contribute to the control of the advancement of
   neoplasia. We have shown that the expressions of interleukin 12 (IL-12)
   and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are decreased in macrophages
   from mammary tumor-bearing mice. In this study, we investigated the
   causes of IL-12 dysregulation and found deficient nuclear factor kappa B
   (NF kappa B) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) expression and
   function in tumor bearers' peritoneal macrophages. The constitutive
   expressions of NF kappa B p50, c-rel, p65, and C/EBP alpha and beta, as
   well as the lipopolysaccharide-induced nuclear translocation and DNA
   binding of NF kappa B components and C/EBP alpha and, are profoundly
   impaired in macrophages from mice bearing D1-DMBA-3 tumors. Because
   similar findings occur with the iNOS gene, it seems that it represents a

Abstract = {{We analyzed the ligand binding specificity of the lymphocyte specific
   kinase (Lck) SH3 domain. We identified artificial Lek SH3 ligands using
   phage display. In addition, we analyzed Lek SH3 binding sites within
   known natural Lek SH3 binding proteins using an Lek specific binding
   assay on membrane-immobilized synthetic peptides. On one hand, from the
   phage-selected peptides, representing mostly special class I' ligands, a
   well-defined consensus sequence was obtained. Interestingly, a histidine
   outside the central polyproline motif contributes significantly to Lck
   SH3 binding affinity and specificity. On the other hand, we confirmed
   previously mapped Lck SH3 binding sites in ADAM15, HS1, SLP76, and NS5A,
   and identified putative Lek SH3 binding sites of Sam68, FasL, c-Cbl, and
   Cbl-b. Without exception, the comparatively diverse Lck SH3 binding
   sites of all analyzed natural Lek SH3 binding proteins emerged as class
   II proteins. Possible explanations for the observed variations between
   artificial and native ligands- which are not due to significant K-D
   value differences as shown by calculating Lek SH3 affinities of
   artificial peptide PD1-Y(-3)R as well as for peptides comprising
   putative Lek S143 binding sites of NS5A, Sos, and Sam68-are discussed.
   Our data suggest that phage display, a popular tool for determining SH3
   binding specificity, must-at least in the case of Lck-not irrevocably
   mirror physiologically relevant protein-ligand interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-state interface reactions were investigated when Cu-Fe alloy leads
   were attached to an electroplated An layer using 50In-50Pb (wt.\%)
   solder. Two An layers of different plating process quality were studied.
   The annealing temperatures were 70, 100, 135, and 170 degrees C and the
   times were 1-2000 h. The dominant reaction layer was a composite of (Au,
   Cu)In-2 IMC and Pb-rich phases. A Au9In4 layer remained < 2 mu m in most
   specimens. Linear rate kinetics (0.8 < n < 1.2) were observed,
   indicating an interface-controlled mechanism. The mean apparent
   activation energy, Delta H, was 56 < Delta H < 73 kJ/mol. The
   Au(9)Iu(4), layer growth kinetics parameters were 0.5 < n < 0.9 and 45 <
   Delta H < 80 kJ/mol, respectively, suggesting a contribution by grain
   boundary diffusion. Annealing at 100 degrees C caused significant
   degradation to the interconnections through extensive void growth, more
   so for the poor plating process. Void development began with small
   Kirkendall voids at the In-Pb/Au interface caused by differing diffusion
   rates of Au and In through the IMC layer. That initial process was
   sensitive to the An layer quality. Void enlargement was caused by a
   dissociation of the (Au, Cu)In-2 LMC and Pb-rich phases in the absence
   of An flux; this process was insensitive to An layer quality. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{To gain insight into the molecular causes and functional consequences of
   allelic inclusion of TCR a-chains, we develop a computational model for
   thymocyte selection in which the signal that determines cell fate
   depends on surface expression. Analysis of receptor pairs on selected
   dual TCR cells reveals that allelic inclusion permits both autoreactive
   TCR and receptors not in the single TCR cell repertoire to be selected.
   However, in comparison with earlier theoretical studies, relatively few
   dual TCR cells display receptors with high avidity for thymic ligands
   because their alpha-chains compete aggressively for the beta-chain,
   which hinders rescue from clonal deletion. This feature of the model
   makes clear that allelic inclusion does not in itself compromise central
   tolerance. A specific experiment based on modulation of TCR surface
   expression levels is proposed to test the model.}},

Abstract = {{We synthesized a series of cyclens substituted with mixed stilbene and
   poly(ethylene glycol) dendritic arms. All dendrimers terminated with
   different peripheral groups had good solubility in common organic
   solvents, and dendrimers terminated with -CO2H groups (CO2H-dendrimers)
   were also soluble in alkaline solutions. The nickel coordination
   properties of these dendrimers were investigated in organic solvents.
   Dendrimers terminated with -CN groups (CN-dendrimers) and the
   second-generation CO2H-dendrimer {[}(CO2H)(8)L2] could produce
   pentacoordinated nickel complexes; the third-generation CO2H-dendrimer
   {[}(CO2H)(16)L3] could form tetra- and pentacoordinated nickel
   complexes, and the nickel complex of the fourth-generation
   CO2H-dendrimer {[}(CO2H)(32)L4] could not be obtained. This result was
   due to the fact that the globular surface Of (CO2H)(16)L3 formed a
   hydrogen-bond network that selectively penetrated cations and inhibited
   the access of anions to the core. The formation of the hydrogen-bond
   network was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared, H-1 NMR, and
   fluorescence data. The CN-dendrimers could not form hydrogen bonds on
   the surface, and the first- and second-generation CO2H-dendrimers could
   not form intramolecular hydrogen-bond networks. Therefore, they had no
   selectivity for positive nickel ions and negative chloride ions.
   (CO2H)(32)L4 could not produce a nickel complex because it had a crammed
   backbone structure that could not penetrate nickel and chloride ions.
   Therefore, it was possible to control the ion access of cations and
   anions with the hydrogen-bond network of (CO2H)(16)L3. (c) 2005 Wiley

Abstract = {{Objective-To estimate the economic impact to veterinary clients for the
   medical and surgical treatment of rupture of the cranial cruciate
   ligament (RCCL) in dogs for the year 2003.
   Design-Economic impact survey.
   Sample Population-501 diplomates of the American College of Veterinary
   Surgeons (ACVS) indicating that their area of surgical emphasis was
   small animal orthopedic surgery or small animal general and orthopedic
   surgery and 4,000 veterinarians indicating to the AVMA that their
   professional area was small animal practice exclusive or mixed animal
   practice (at least 80\% small animal).
   Procedure-Veterinarians were surveyed concerning the cost for medical
   and surgical treatment of RCCL for 2003. The economic impact was
   calculated by multiplying the number of RCCL surgeries performed by the
   mean cost of surgery. This was added to the number of RCCL cases managed
   medically multiplied by the mean cost of medical management. This
   estimate for survey responders was extrapolated to the total number of
   veterinarians in the study population for the ACVS or AVMA.
   Results-Estimates for the total cost of surgery were \$171,730,134.72
   and \$1,020,167,907 for veterinarians in the ACVS and AVMA populations,
   respectively. The cost of medical management was \$2,885,68786 and
   \$126,558,155.16 for veterinarians in the ACVS and AVMA populations,
   respectively. After combining the ACVS and AVMA populations, we
   estimated that owners spent \$1.32 billion for the treatment of RCCL in
   the United States in 2003.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-RCCL is a prevalent, costly injury.
   Results may motivate veterinary and consumer agencies to prioritize
   funding for a better understanding of the injury.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the fluvial geochemistry of the Huang He (Yellow River) in
   its headwaters to determine natural chemical weathering rates on the
   northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where anthropogenic impact is
   considered small. Qualitative treatment of the major element composition
   demonstrates the dominance of carbonate and evaporite dissolution. Most
   samples are supersaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite, and
   atmospheric CO2 with moderate (0.710-0.715) Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, while
   six out of 21 total samples have especially high concentrations of Na,
   Ca, Mg, Cl, and SO4 from weathering of evaporites. We used inversion
   model calculations to apportion the total dissolved cations to rain-,
   evaporite-, carbonate-, and silicate-origin. The samples are either
   carbonate- or evaporite-dominated, but the relative contributions of the
   four sources vary widely among samples. Net CO2 consumption rates by
   silicate weathering (6-120 X 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr) are low and have a
   relative uncertainty of similar to 40\%. We extended the inversion model
   calculation to literature data for rivers draining orogenic zones
   worldwide. The Ganges-Brahmaputra draining the Himalayan front has
   higher CO2 consumption rates (110-570 X 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr) and more
   radiogenic Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.715-1.24) than the Upper Huang He, but the
   rivers at higher latitudes are similar to or lower than the Upper Huang
   He in CO2 uptake by silicate weathering. In these orogenic zones,
   silicate weathering rates are only weakly coupled with temperature and
   become independent of runoff above similar to 800 mm/yr. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{In this study, we demonstrated that double-stranded RNA-dependent
   protein kinase (PKR) is required for the calcification of osteoblasts
   via the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 alpha(STAT1
   alpha) signaling in vitro. A dominant-negative mutant PKR cDNA, in which
   the amino acid lysine at 296 was replaced with arginine and which does
   not have catalytic activity, was transfected into mouse ostcoblastic
   MC3T3-E1 cells, thereby, we established cells that stably expressed the
   PKR mutant gene (PKR-K/R). Phosphorylation of PKR was not stimulated by
   polyinosic-polycytidylic acid in the mutant cells. The PKR-K/R mutant
   cells exhibited up-regulated cell growth and had low alkaline
   phosphatase (ALP) activity. The PKR-K/R mutant cells were not able to
   form bone nodules in vitro. In the PKR-K/R mutant cells, runt-related
   gene 2 (Runx2)-mediated transcription decreased compared with the levels
   in the control cells. The expression of STAT1 alpha protein increased
   and the protein was translocated to the nucleus in the PKR-K/R mutant
   cells. When the expression of STAT1 alpha a protein in PKR Mutant cells
   was suppressed using RNAi, the activity of Runx2-mediated transcription
   recovered to the control level. Our results indicate that PKR is a
   stimulator of Runx2 transcription and is a negative modulator of STAT1
   alpha expression. Our findings also suggest that PKR plays important
   roles in the differentiation and calcification of osteoblasts by
   modulating STAT1 alpha and/or Runx2 expression. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Chemokines and their receptors are well described in the immune system,
   where they promote cell migration and activation. In the central nervous
   system, chemokine has been implicated in neuroinflammatory processes.
   However, an increasing number of evidence suggests that they have
   regulatory functions in the normal nervous system, where they could
   participate in cell communication. In this work, using a
   semiquantitative immunohistochemistry approach, we provide the first
   neuroanatomical mapping of constitutive neuronal CCR2 localization.
   Neuronal expression of CCR2 was observed in the anterior olfactory
   nucleus, cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, caudate putamen, globus
   pallidus, supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, amygdala,
   substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and in the brainstem and
   cerebellum. These data are largely in accordance with results obtained
   using quantitative autoradiography with {[}I-125]MCP-1/CCL2 and RT-PCR
   CCR2 mRNA analysis. Furthermore, using dual fluorescent
   immunohistochemistry we studied the chemical phenotype of labeled
   neurons and demonstrated the coexistence of CCR2 with classical
   neurotransmitters. Indeed, localization of CCR2 immunostaining is
   observed in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta
   and in the ventral tegmental area as well as in cholinergic neurons in
   the substantia innominata and caudate putamen. Finally, we show that the
   preferential CCR2 ligand, MCP-1/CCL2, elicits Ca2+ transients in primary
   cultured neurons from various rat brain regions including the cortex,
   hippocampus, hypothalamus, and mesencephalon. In conclusion, the
   constitutive neuronal CCR2 expression in selective brain structures
   suggests that this receptor could be involved in neuronal communication
   and possibly associated with cholinergic and dopaminergic
   neurotransmission and related disorders.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To determine the fasting plasma carnitine ester in patients with
   celiac disease.
   METHODS: We determined the fasting plasma carnitine ester profile using
   ESI triple quadrupol mass spectrometry in 33 adult patients with
   biopsy-confirmed maturity onset celiac disease maintained on long term
   gluten free diet.
   RESULTS: The level of free carnitine did not differ as the celiac
   disease patients were compared with the healthy controls, whereas the
   acetylcarnitine level was markedly reduced (4.703 +/- 0.205 vs 10.227
   +/- 0.368 nmol/mL, P < 0.01). The level of propionylcarnitine was
   61.5\%, butyrylcarnitine 56.9\%, hexanoylcarnitine 75\%,
   octanoylcarnitine 71.1\%, octenoylcarnitine 52.1\%, decanoylcarnitine
   73.1\%, cecenoylcarnitine 58.3\%, lauroylcarnitine 61.5\%,
   miristoylcarnitine 66.7\%, miristoleylcarnitine 62.5\% and
   oleylcarnitine 81.1\% in the celiac disease patients compared to the
   control values, respectively (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSION: The marked decrease of circulating acetylcarnitine with
   50-80 \% decrease of 11 other carnitine esters shows that the carnitine
   ester metabolism can be influenced even in clinically asymptomatic and
   well being adult celiac disease patients, and gluten withdrawal alone
   does not necessarily normalize all elements of the disturbed carnitine
   homeostasis. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Fish live in a complex and diverse aquatic environment. Various
   environmental stressors continuously challenge the physiology of fish.
   Social stress has a crucial role to play in immunity of fish. Hence, an
   attempt was made to investigate whether a stressor would have
   differential effect on the immune system of Oreochromis mossambicus when
   maintained in different sex ratios. Fish were crowded by confining at
   three different densities, i.e., 4 g l(-1) (control), 8 g l(-1) or 16 g
   l(-1) and in three different sex ratios, i.e., (i) all-male, (ii)
   all-female and (iii) equal male and female (mixed). Confinement stress
   was maintained for a period of 28 days and the fish were assessed for
   their specific immune response in terms of antibody response to
   Aeromonas hydrophila assayed by ELISA and plaque forming cell assay,
   nonspecific immune response in terms of intracellular ROS production by
   peripheral blood leukocytes, serum lysozyme level and integrated
   immunity by host resistance. The results showed that chronic confinement
   enhanced specific immunity in monosex ratio groups in terms of both
   antibody response, in the number of antibody producing cells. The
   nonspecific immune parameter and serum lysozyme level showed enhancement
   on confinement in all-male sex ratio group, whereas the ROS production
   showed suppression on confinement irrespective of sex ratio. The host
   resistance test revealed that enhanced specific immunity and lysozyme
   activity were not protective by showing 56\% mortality in all-male
   confined group. Fish maintained as equal male and female group showed
   marginal level of protection in control group. Hence, the social
   environment in terms of sex ratio does have both positive and/or
   negative impact on the immune system depending on the degree of
   confinement. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   rats. After a single oral administration of the aqueous extract (20

   rats (p < 0.001) was observed; the blood glucose levels were normalized
   after 2 weeks of daily oral administration of TR aqueous extract (20
   mg/kg) (p < 0.001). Significant reduction on blood glucose levels were
   noticed in normal rats after both acute (p < 0.001) and chronic
   treatment (p < 0.001). In addition, no changes were observed in basal
   plasma insulin concentrations after treatment in either normal or STZ
   diabetic rats indicating that the underlying mechanism of this

Abstract = {{I demonstrate the existence of quasi-realistic heterotic-string models
   in which all the untwisted Kahler and complex structure moduli, as well

   generalized GSO projections. I discuss the conditions and
   characteristics of the models that produce this result. The existence of
   such models offers a novel perspective on the realization of extra
   dimensions in string theory. In this view, while the geometrical picture
   provides a useful mean to classify string vacua, in the
   phenomenologically viable cases there is no physical realization of
   extra dimensions. The models under consideration correspond to Z(2) X
   Z(2) orbifolds of six-dimensional tori, plus additional identifications
   by internal shifts and twists. The special property of the Z(2) X Z(2)
   orbifold is that it may act on the compactified dimensions as real,
   rather than complex, dimensions. This property enables an asymmetric
   projection on all six internal coordinates, which enables the projection

Abstract = {{A dynamic mechanical analysis has been performed on a thermotropic
   poly(ether ester) with biphenyl units as mesogens and spacers with

   rather slow rate of formation, in such a way that the isotropic melt of
   this polymer can be easily quenched into the glassy amorphous state. A
   quenched amorphous sample and three specimens annealed above the glass
   transition for different times have been analysed. These annealed
   specimens exhibit different degrees of liquid crystal formation. The
   dynamic mechanical (and DSC) results show that the glass transition
   (alpha-relaxation) temperatures of the isotropic amorphous and
   anisotropic liquid crystalline states are clearly different, and when
   the mesophase transformation is not complete, as it happens in the two
   specimens annealed at intermediate times, the two glass transitions are
   simultaneously observed. The values of the storage modulus below the
   glass transition are dependent on the degree of liquid crystallinity,
   showing that the rigidity of the mesophase is significantly higher than
   the one for the amorphous component. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   the strong influence of the RTIL nature on the first solvation shell Of
   Europium and on its complexation with chloride. Depending on the RTIL,
   europium(III), which was introduced in solution as a triflate salt, is
   found to be solvated either by RTIL anions only or as neutral
   undissociated EuTf3 moieties completed by solvent anions. Kinetic
   effects, related to the viscosity of the RTIL and the nature of the
   europium salt, also markedly influence the coordination of added Cl- or

Abstract = {{The entrainment matrix (also termed the Andreev-Bashkin matrix or the
   mass-density matrix) for a neutron-proton mixture is derived at a finite
   temperature in a neutron star core. The calculation is performed in the
   frame of the Landau-Fermi-liquid theory generalized to account for
   superfluidity of nucleons. It is shown, that the temperature dependence
   of the entrainment matrix is described by a universal function
   independent on an actual model of nucleon-nucleon interaction employed.
   The results are presented in the form convenient for their practical
   use. The entrainment matrix is important, e.g., in kinetics of
   superfluid nucleon mixtures or in studies of the dynamical evolution of
   neutron stars (in particular, in the studies of star pulsations and

Abstract = {{GaAs nanowires were grown by molecular-beam epitaxy on (111)B oriented
   surfaces, after the deposition of Au nanoparticles. Different growth
   durations and different growth terminations were tested. After the
   growth of the nanowires, the structure and the composition of the
   metallic particles were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and
   energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. We identified three different
   metallic compounds: the hexagonal beta(')Au(7)Ga(2) structure, the
   orthorhombic AuGa structure, and an almost pure Au face centered cubic
   structure. We explain how these different solid phases are related to
   the growth history of the samples. It is concluded that during the wire
   growth, the metallic particles are liquid, in agreement with the
   generally accepted vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. In addition, the
   analysis of the wire morphology indicates that Ga adatoms migrate along
   the wire sidewalls with a mean length of about 3 mu m. (C) 2005 American

   polymer/fullerene solar cells}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{A typical feature of polymer/fullerene based solar cells is that the
   current density under short-circuit conditions (J(sc)) does not scale
   exactly linearly with light intensity (I). Instead, a power law
   relationship is found given by J(sc)proportional to I-alpha, where alpha
   ranges from 0.85 to 1. In a number of reports this deviation from unity
   is speculated to arise from the occurrence of bimolecular recombination.
   We demonstrate that the dependence of the photocurrent in bulk
   heterojunction solar cells is governed by the build-up of space-charge
   in the device as a consequence of a difference in electron- and hole
   mobility. We have verified this for an experimental model system in
   which the mobility difference can be tuned from one to three orders of
   magnitude by changing the annealing treatment. (C) 2005 American

Abstract = {{Background: We analyzed data from a single menstrual cycle from 630
   women, aged 43 to 53 years, in the Daily Hormone Study component of the
   Study of Women's Health Across the Nation to determine whether hormone
   levels are associated with trouble sleeping as women enter the
   menopausal transition. Methods: Women recorded whether they had trouble
   sleeping the previous night. Morning urine specimens were obtained for
   daily determinations of levels of luteinizing hormone,
   follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol metabolites (ie, estrone
   conjugates), and the progesterone metabolite (pregnanediol glucuronide).
   Women were categorized as premenopausal or early perimenopausal by
   bleeding patterns.
   Results: Average adjusted odds of reporting trouble sleeping were 29\%
   higher in perimenopausal than in premenopausal women. The highest
   percentages of women in both menopausal groups reported trouble sleeping
   in the beginning or at the end of their cycle. After controlling for
   covariates, pregnanediol glucuronide level was associated with increased
   trouble sleeping in perimenopausal women and follicle-stimulating
   hormone level was associated with increased trouble sleeping in
   premenopausal women. Mood and vasomotor symptoms were the strongest and
   most consistent cocontributors to trouble sleeping.
   Conclusion: In this community-based sample of middle-aged women, the
   most trouble sleeping was observed at the beginning and end of the
   menstrual cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of the ``green water{''} grow-out culture of the tiger
   shrimp Penaeus monodon to prevent outbreaks of Luminous Vibriosis was
   investigated by screening associated isolates of bacteria, fungi,
   phytoplankton and fish skin mucus for anti-luminous Vibrio metabolites.
   Among the 85 bacterial isolates tested, 63 (74\%) caused +similar to+++
   inhibition of the vibrio, harveyi pathogen after 24-48 h co-cultivation.
   The variation in growth inhibition rates of +, ++, and +++ were
   demonstrated by 15 (18\%), 13 (15\%), and 28 (33\%) isolates,
   respectively, 24 h after treatment. Eight bacterial isolates showed
   consistently sustained maximum inhibition of luminous Vibrio after 24 to
   48 h exposure. The majority of these luminous Vibrio inhibiting
   bacterial isolates were obtained from tilapia mucus and gut. In tests
   with fungi, 4 of 20 (20\%) yeast isolates showed intracellular
   metabolites inhibitory to luminous Vibrio. Among filamentous fungi, 5 of
   45 (11\%) isolates yielded intracellular metabolites while 3 of 41 (7\%)
   isolates had extracellular metabolites inhibitory to luminous Vibrio.
   These fungal isolates were identified as Rhodotorula sp., Saccharomyces
   sp., Candida sp., Penicillium sp., mycelia sterilia, and two
   unidentified species. The microalgae, Chaetoceros calcitrans and
   Nitzchia sp., consistently demonstrated complete inhibition of luminous
   Vibrio from 24 h and 48 h post exposure, respectively, and during the
   7-day experiment. Leptolyngbia sp. caused a 94-100\% reduction of the
   luminous Vibrio population from 10(4) to 10(1) cfu/ml 24 h post exposure
   which was sustained throughout the 10-day observation period. In
   contrast, the inhibitory effects of Skeletonema costatum on luminous
   Vibrio was bacteriostatic throughout the 7-day exposure while
   Nannochlorum sp. did not significantly inhibit luminous Vibrio. The skin
   mucus of jewel tilapia, Tilapia hornorum, had no resident luminous
   bacteria and inhibited this bacterial pathogen in 6-48 h, which was
   proportionate to the 10(3) and 10(5) cfu/ml test concentrations of
   luminous Vibrio. This study provides a scientific explanation that the
   effectiveness of the ``green water{''} culture of tiger shrimp (P.
   monodon) in preventing outbreaks of luminous Vibriosis among P. monodon
   juveniles in grow-out ponds can be attributed to the presence of
   anti-luminous Vibrio factors in the bacterial, fungal, phytoplankton
   microbiota and the skin mucus of tilapia associated with this novel
   technique of shrimp culture. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   normal gastric mucosa (0.53 +/- 0.13) and chronic superficial gastritis
   (0.47 +/- 0.19) (P = 0.000); in dysplasia (16.74 +/- 0.82) than in
   intestinal metaplasia (P = 0.000); in gastric primary carcinoma (31.34
   +/- 2.17) than in dysplasia and adjacent mucosa (P = 0.000); in
   metastasis gastric carcinoma in lymph nodes (39.76 +/- 2.00) than in
   primary gastric carcinoma (P = 0.037), respectively. Skp2 labeling
   frequency was positively associated with differentiation degree (rho =
   0.315, P = 0.000), vessel invasion (rho = 0.303, P = 0.000) and lymph
   node metastasis (rho = 0.254, P = 0.000) of gastric cancer. Expression
   of Skp2 was negatively associated with p27 (rho = -0.451, P = 0.000) and
   PTEN (rho = -0.480, P = 0.000) expression in gastric carcinoma. p27
   expression was positively associated with PTEN expression in gastric
   carcinoma (rho = 0.642, P = 0.000).
   CONCLUSION: Skp2 overexpression may be involved in carcinogenesis and
   progression of human gastric carcinoma in vivo, possibly via p27
   proteolysis. PTEN may regulate the expression of p27 by negatively
   regulating Skp2 expression. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Sediments and macroinvertebrate diversity underneath suspended mussel
   lines were examined in a shallow water system in Prince Edward Island,
   Canada. The objectives of the study were to describe the benthic
   environment in a typical mussel farm from eastern Canada and to
   underline various relationships between benthic parameters and husbandry
   practices. Benthic parameters included granulometry of the sediments,
   organic matter and sulfide contents as well as redox potential and
   common macroinvertebrate diversity indices. Husbandry operation
   parameters investigated were the number of years of operation and mussel
   culture density for a given lease. The results did not show any
   particular spatial patterns. The sediments' mud content varied between
   96 and 100\%. Redox potential varied between -150 and 250 mV while
   sulfide concentration ranged between 100 and 9500 mu M. Organic matter
   content varied between 1 and 16\%. A total of 31 species were
   identified. Diversity indices were small throughout the study site. The
   number of years of operation for a given site varied between 0 (control
   sites) and 16 years while mussel culture densities ranged between 0
   (control sites) and 0.70 kg/m(2). Overall, no strong relationship was
   underlined between benthic parameters and studied husbandry practices.
   BIOENV analyses showed that culture density explained a small proportion
   of the benthic assemblages variability underneath mussel lines when
   using the macroinvertebrate abundance data set (r = 0.137). Similar
   analyses showed that water depth better explained the variability
   observed under mussel lines when using the macroinvertebrate
   presence/absence data set (r = 0.263). The absence of a strong
   relationship between husbandry practices and the studied benthic
   parameters might be related to the oceanographic characteristics and
   land-based activities associated with the water system rather than
   direct and cumulative effects of mussel culture. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{We have studied the process and kinetics of the order-order phase
   transition (OOT) from spheres in a body-centered-cubic lattice
   (bccsphere) to hexagonally packed cylindrical microdomains
   (hex-cylinder) for a poly styrene-block-polyisoprene-block-polystyrene
   triblock copolymer, induced by abrupt temperature drops. In this study,
   time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements are
   conducted to investigate the OOT processes in situ and at real time.
   Transmission electron microscopy observations for specimens rapidly
   frozen below the glass transition temperature at particular times in the
   OOT processes are also conducted to visualize the transient structures
   developed during the OOT. We elucidated the following pieces of
   evidence. (I) The OOT proceeds via the nucleation and growth process as
   follows: After quenching the specimen, the system stays at a bcc-sphere
   state in the incubation period, t(i). After this period, (II)
   anisotropic grains of hex-cylinder are nucleated at the vicinity of
   grain boundaries of bee sphere. (III) The growth of the grains appears
   to be faster along the cylindrical axis than along the direction
   perpendicular to it, on the contrary to the growth of hex-cylinder from
   the disordered phase. The OOT involves deformation of spherical domains
   toward a {[}111] direction of a bee lattice, followed by coalescence and
   connection of them to cylindrical microdomains. (IV) The rate of OOT as
   observed by time-resolved SAXS was found to depend on quench depth,
   Delta T (equivalent to T-OOT - T-cyl)=4-10 K, or thermodynamic driving
   force for the OOT, epsilon(equivalent to Delta T/T-OOT) =0.0087-0.0217,
   where TOOT is the OOT temperature between hex-cylinder and bcc-sphere:
   The larger AT or - is, the shorter t(i) is and the faster the
   transformation rate, R-T, is after the incubation time. (V)
   Consequently, the time change of a characteristic parameter as observed
   by SAXS at various Delta Ts fall on to a master curve when real time is
   reduced with ti, revealing that the following two intriguing
   conclusions: (i) t(i) and R-T(-1) have the same temperature dependence,
   and hence the system has only single time scale, and (ii) the
   transformation after the incubation period starts only when the
   characteristic parameter reaches a temperature independent critical
   value. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To assess the frequency of herpes simplex virus type I in upper
   gastrointestinal tract ulcers and normal mucosa with the modern and
   better assays and also with a larger number of well characterized
   patients and controls and its relationship to Helicobacter pylori (H
   pylori).
   METHODS: Biopsy specimens from 90 patients (34 with gastric ulcer of the
   prepyloric area and 56 with duodenal ulcer) were evaluated. Biopsies
   from 50 patients with endoscopically healthy mucosa were considered as
   the control group. The method used to identify herpes simplex virus-1
   (HSV-1) was polymerase chain reaction. H pylori was detected by the
   CLO-test and by histological method.
   RESULTS: Herpes simplex virus-1 was detected in 28 of 90 patients with
   peptic ulcer (31\%) {[}11 of 34 patients with gastric ulcer (32.4\%) and
   17 of 56 with duodenal ulcer (30.4\%)] exclusively close to the ulcerous
   lesion. All control group samples were negative for HSV-1. The
   likelihood of H pylori negativity among peptic ulcer patients was
   significantly higher in HSV-1 positive cases than in HSV-1 negative
   cases (P = 0.009). Gastric ulcer patients with HSV-1 positivity were
   strongly associated with an increased possibility of Helicobacter pylori
   negativity compared to duodenal ulcer patients (P = 0.010).
   CONCLUSION: HSV-1 is frequent in upper gastro-intestinal tract ulcers
   but not in normal gastric and duodenal mucosa. There is an inverse
   association between HSV-1 and H pylori infection. (C) 2005 The WJG Press

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate the growth suppression of adenovirus expressing
   p27(kip1) on established esophageal tumors in nude mice.
   METHODS: Esophageal carcinoma xenografts in nude mice were established
   by tumor tissue mass transplantation. The successfully constructed
   recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying p27(kip1) gene (Ad-p27(kip1))
   were directly injected into the esophageal tumors in nude mice. Compared
   to control group, the growth curve of tumor was drawn and the growth
   inhibition rate of tumor was calculated. The histology of tumors was
   examined by hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) staining. The expression of
   p27(kip1) and survivin was detected in tumors by immunohistochemical
   technique.
   RESULTS: The growth of tumors in gene therapy group with Ad-p27(kip1)
   was obviously suppressed compared to control group (0.42 +/- 0.08 g vs
   1.17 +/- 0.30 g, t=6.39, P < 0.01), the inhibition rate of tumor growth
   reached 64.1\%. Pathological detection showed that the tumors in nude
   mice were poorly differentiated esophageal squamous carcinoma. In
   addition, the expression of p27(kip1) was increased, while the
   expression of survivin was decreased in tumors after being transfected
   with Ad-p27(kip1).
   CONCLUSION: p27(kip1) gene therapy mediated by adenovirus vector has a
   significant inhibitory effect on esophageal carcinoma in vivo.
   Up-regulated p27(kip1) expression and down-regulated survivin expression
   may be its important mechanisms. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier

Abstract = {{The formation and complexing behaviors of non-soluble polyelectrolyte
   complexes (nPECs) between ammonium polyacrylate (A40) and
   poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDC) polyelectrolytes at
   different A40/PDC mass ratios, pHs and KNO3 concentrations were studied
   using particle size and zeta potential measurement techniques. It was
   found that the particle size distributions and surface charge behaviors
   of the formed nPECs were related to the mass ratio of participating
   polyelectrolytes and KNO3 concentrations. Without addition of KNO3,
   there was no nPECs formed at a mass ratio of 0.1. Both fine and large
   nPECs were formed at mass ratios of 0.2 and 0.6 while only fine nPECs
   formed at a mass ratio of 0.4. Increasing the mass ratio from 0.8 had no
   significant effect on particle size distribution. The observed
   complexing behaviors were related to the histories of charge
   neutralization degree of PDC and the surface zeta potentials of nPECs.
   The addition of electrolyte would result in bigger nPECs attributable to
   the shielding effect and weakened electrostatic interaction for
   polyelectrolytes and nPECs, and hence the linkage of nPEC became
   possible. The pH changes affected the surface zeta potentials of nPECs
   due to the variation in ionization of A40 molecules. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{During the kidding season between January and April 2003, 10 farms were
   selected and divided into two groups of five. The farms in group A had
   had serious diarrhoeal illness and losses in neonatal kids the previous
   year, and there were Cryptosporidium parvum infections in kids
   associated with diarrhoea during the survey. on the farms in group B,
   there was no history of diarrhoeal disease the previous year and neither
   C parvum oocysts nor diarrhoea were detected in neonatal kids during the
   survey. Faecal samples were collected once from 10 adult goats aged
   between one and seven years on each farm. To assess more accurately the
   pattern of output of oocysts of C parvum and cysts of Giardia duodenalis
   by periparturient adult goats, one farm was selected from each group,
   faecal samples were collected weekly before and after kidding from 12
   goats on the farm in group A and from 10 goats on the farm in group B.
   There was no significant difference in the prevalence of G duodenalis
   cysts between the group A farms (14 per cent) and the group B farms (12
   per cent), and the numbers of cysts excreted ranged from 143 to 400
   cysts per gram of faeces (cpg) on the group A farms and 72 to 334 cpg on
   the group B farms. There was a significant difference (P=0.03) in the
   prevalence of C parvum oocysts at the group level between the group A
   farms (20 per cent) and the group B farms (6 per cent). All the adult
   goats excreted cysts and oocysts at some date around the kidding period;
   the number of animals excreting cysts of G duodenalis or oocysts of C
   parvum increased when they gave birth, and seven to 10 times more cysts
   and oocysts were shed in the three weeks around kidding than in the
   period more than three weeks from kidding (P<0.001).}},

Abstract = {{Southern African wildfires are a globally significant source of trace
   gases and aerosols. Estimates of southern African wildfire fuel
   consumption have varied from hundreds to thousands of teragrams (Tg),
   and better-constrained estimates are required to properly assess the
   effects of the pollutant emissions. A new approach for providing such
   estimates is via remote sensing observations of fire radiative power
   (FRP), a variable proportional to the rate of fuel consumption. The
   launch of the SEVIRI radiometer onboard the geostationary Meteosat-8
   platform presents a unique opportunity to monitor FRP at 15-min
   intervals, allowing analysis of the complete diurnal cycle of biomass
   burning and calculation of the total fire radiative energy. Here we
   present the first FRP retrievals from SEVIRI and compare them to those
   derived from near-coincident MODIS overpasses. Strong agreement is
   achieved on a per-fire basis (r(2) = 0.83, n = 139, p < 0.0001),
   although at the regional scale SEVIRI typically underestimates FRP with
   respect to MODIS due primarily to its inability to confidently detect
   fire pixels with FRP < similar to 100 MW. Using relationships developed
   during ground-based experiments, SEVIRI-derived FRP measures are
   converted into estimates of the rate and total quantity of biomass
   combusted in southern Africa. During a 4.5 day monitoring period, and
   based on only the observed FRP recorded by SEVIRI, we infer that as a
   minimum estimate, peak combustion rates reached 50 tons/s and a total of
   3.2 Tg of fuel was burnt in southern Africa. While provisional, we
   calculate that these figures maybe potentially increased upward by a
   factor of similar to 3 to account for atmospheric absorption of the
   upwelling radiation and for fires that were potentially cloud covered or
   too weakly emitting to be detected by the geostationary imager. The new
   tool of SEVIRI-derived FRP provides an insight into biomass burning on
   the African continent at a hitherto unobtainable temporal frequency,
   highly suited to the linking of pollutant emissions estimates to models
   of atmospheric transport.}},

Abstract = {{Stable water isotope tracers (HDO and (H2O)-O-18) are incorporated into
   the ModelE version of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies
   Atmospheric (GISS) General Circulation Model (GCM). Details of the moist
   convective parameterisation, cloud phase, background ozone, isotope
   kinetics and vertical resolution are varied and we examine their
   impacts, particularly in the upper troposphere (UT) and lower
   stratosphere. We find that isotopes in precipitation, except in
   Antarctica, are largely unaffected by these changes and thus are not a
   useful metric for evaluating model skill above the lower troposphere.
   Simulated isotopic entry values into the stratosphere over all
   experiments range between -750 and -600\% for HDO, and -130 to -90\% for
   (H2O)-O-18, demonstrating that the mixing processes simulated by the
   model can explain a significant part of the observed offset from pure
   Rayleigh distillation. Isotope fields are shown to be sensitive to the
   parameterisation of cloud physics and representation of UT processes and
   therefore may be useful in constraining modeled cloud physics and
   mechanisms of stratosphere-troposphere water vapour exchange.}},

Title = {{Arctic sea ice response to wind stress variations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{C11}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] Timescale of sea ice response to wind stress variations and the
   mechanisms controlling the timescale are investigated by a coupled sea
   ice - ocean model. Wind stress variations account for a significant part
   of the changes of sea ice volume in the Arctic Ocean over the last
   several decades. The changes of sea ice volume associated with wind
   stress are mainly induced by changes of sea ice outflow from the Arctic
   Ocean. While outflow immediately responds to wind stress variations,
   responses of sea ice volume lag behind the changes of the outflow by
   several years. For example, when the model is driven by interannually
   varying wind stress with the other atmospheric forcing components given
   by climatology, sea ice outflow abruptly decreases in 1996 and remains
   almost constant for the following several years. However, the responding
   increase of sea ice volume is gradual and continues for several years.
   In order to clarify the timescale of sea ice response to an abrupt
   change of wind stress and the mechanisms controlling the timescale, the
   model is forced by two typical wind stress fields, which cause small and
   large outflow. Equilibrium annual mean ice thickness averaged over the
   Arctic Ocean is different by about 50 cm between these two wind-forcing
   fields. Starting from the equilibrium state obtained under one of these
   two fields, wind-forcing is switched to the other. Adjustment time of
   ice thickness is then defined as the year when annual mean ice thickness
   is adjusted to new equilibrium by 90\% of the difference between the two
   equilibria. The timescale of the sea ice response and the mechanisms
   controlling the timescale are found to be different depending on whether
   the outflow increases or decreases. When the outflow increases, the
   timescale depends on the advection time of the sea ice flowing toward
   the exits. When the outflow decreases, the timescale depends on the
   thermodynamic growth rate of sea ice. The change in the late 1990s
   corresponds to the latter case.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies have examined the structural properties of late
   folding intermediates Of beta/U=alpha)(8)-barrel proteins involved in
   tryptophan biosynthesis, whereas there is little information available
   about the early folding events of these proteins. To identify the
   contiguous polypeptide segments important to the folding of the
   (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel protein Escherichia coli
   N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate isomerase, we structurally
   characterized fragments and circularly permuted forms of the protein. We
   also simulated thermal unfolding of the protein using molecular
   dynamics. Our fragmentation experiments demonstrate that the isolated
   (beta/alpha()1-4)beta(5) fragment is almost as stable as the full-length
   protein. The far and near-UV CD spectra of this fragment are indicative
   of native-like secondary and tertiary structures. Structural analysis of
   the circularly permutated proteins shows that if the protein is cleaved
   within the two N-terminal beta alpha modules, the amount of secondary
   structure is unaffected, whereas, when cleaved within the central
   (beta/alpha)(3-4)beta(5) segment, the protein simply cannot fold. An
   ensemble of the denatured structures produced by thermal unfolding
   simulations contains a persistent local structure comprised Of beta(3),
   beta(4) and beta(5). The presence of this three-stranded P-barrel
   suggests that it may be an important early-stage folding intermediate.
   Interactions found in (beta/alpha)(3-4)beta(5) may be essential for the
   early events of ePRAI folding if they provide a nucleation site that
   directs folding. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{ClpB cooperates with the DnaK chaperone system in the reactivation of
   protein from aggregates and is a member of the ATPases associated with a
   variety of cellular activities (AAA+) protein family. The underlying
   disaggregation reaction is dependent on ATP hydrolysis at both AAA
   cassettes of ClpB but the role of each AAA cassette in the reaction
   cycle is largely unknown. Here we analyze the activity of the separately
   expressed and purified nucleotide binding domains of ClpB from Thermus
   thermophilus. The two fragments show different biochemical properties:
   the first construct is inactive in ATPase activity assays and binds
   nucleotides weakly, the second construct has a very high ATPase activity
   and interacts tightly with nucleotides. Both individual fragments have
   lost their chaperone function and are not able to form large oligomers.
   When combined in solution, however, the two fragments form a stable
   heterodimer with oligomerization capacities equivalent to wildtype ClpB.
   This non-covalent complex regains activity in reactivating protein
   aggregates in cooperation with the DnaK chaperone system. Upon complex
   formation the ATPase activity of fragment 2 is reduced to a level
   similar to wild-type ClpB. Hence functional ClpB can be reassembled from
   its isolated AAA cassettes showing that covalent linkage of these
   domains is not a prerequisite for the chaperone activity. The
   observation that the intrinsically high ATPase activity of AAA2 is
   suppressed by AAA1 allows a hypothetical assignment of their mechanistic
   function. Whereas the energy gained upon ATP hydrolysis at the AAA2 is
   likely to drive a conformational change of the structure of ClpB, AAA1
   might function as a regulator of the chaperone cycle.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] On a geomagnetically disturbed and non-spread F night (12 February
   2004), the OI 630.0 nm airglow intensity variations recorded from
   Gadanki (13.5 degrees N, 79.2 degrees E, dip 12.5 degrees) reveal
   quasi-periodic intensity fluctuations superimposed on the large-scale
   temporal variation during 1945 - 2315 Indian Standard Time (IST, IST =
   Universal Time ( UT) + 5.5 hours). The residual airglow intensity
   fluctuations ( after detrending the large-scale variation) with
   periodicities of similar to 0.5 hours and similar to 1.0 hours,
   respectively, are found to vary in accordance with the F layer height
   variations over the dip equator as well as with the Y-component of the
   interplanetary electric field (IEFy) variations calculated from the
   Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite data on 12 February 2004.
   Furthermore, these kind of periodic scale sizes in the residual airglow
   intensity fluctuations are not found on a geomagnetically quiet night
   (20 February 2004) and those intensity fluctuations do not show any
   correspondence with the F layer height variations over equator. Similar
   periodic components are also found in the temporal variations of
   instantaneous horizontal magnetic field (H) recorded at multiple
   stations over Indian subcontinent during the same interval on 12
   February 2004. It is discussed that the currents responsible for the
   magnetic fluctuations are probably of magnetospheric origin. These
   observations using multiple techniques elicit the signature of the
   penetrating solar wind electric field in the nocturnal airglow intensity
   variations over low latitude during magnetically disturbed period.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in Ca2+ influx through the L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC, Cav1.2)
   augment sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ loading and the amplitude of
   the cytosolic Ca2+ transient to enhance cardiac myocyte contractility.
   Our hypothesis is that persistent increases in Ca2+ influx through the
   LTCC cause apoptosis if the excessive influx results in SR Ca2+
   overload. Feline ventricular myocytes (VMs) in primary culture were
   infected with either an adenovirus (Ad) containing a rat Cav1.2 beta(2a)
   subunit- green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion gene (Ad beta(2a)) to
   increase Ca2+ influx or with AdGFP as a control. Significantly fewer
   beta(2a)-VMs (21.4 +/- 5.6\%) than GFP-VMs (99.6 +/- 1.7\%) were viable
   at 96 hours. A fraction of beta(2a)-VMs (20.8 +/- 1.8\%) contracted
   spontaneously (SC-beta(2a)-VMs), and viability was significantly
   correlated with the percentage of SC-beta(2a)-VMs. Higher percentages of
   apoptotic nuclei, DNA laddering, and cytochrome C release were detected
   in beta(2a)-VMs. This apoptosis was prevented with pancaspase or
   caspase-3 or caspase-9 inhibitors. L-type calcium current (ICa-L)
   density was greater in beta(2a)-VMs (23.4 +/- 2.8 pA/ pF) than in
   GFP-VMs (7.6 +/- 1.6 pA/ pF). SC-beta(2a)-VMs had higher diastolic
   intracellular Ca2+ (Indo-1 ratio: 1.1 +/- 0.1 versus 0.7 +/- 0.03, P <
   0.05) and systolic Ca2+ transients (1.89 +/- 0.27 versus 0.80 +/- 0.08)
   than GFP-VMs. Inhibitors of Ca2+ influx, SR Ca2+ uptake and release,
   mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, mitochondrial permeation transition pore,
   calpain, and Bcl-2-associated X protein protected beta(2a)-VMs from
   apoptosis. These results show that persistent increases in Ca2+ influx
   through the ICa-L enhance contractility but lead to apoptosis through a
   mitochondrial death pathway if SR Ca2+ overload is induced.}},

Abstract = {{Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which consists of oxygen-sensitive
   HIF-1 alpha and constitutively expressed HIF-1 beta subunits, activates
   transcription of genes encoding proteins that mediate adaptive responses
   to reduced oxygen availability. The mouse inhibitory PAS (Per/Arnt/Sim)
   domain protein (IPAS) functions as a negative regulator in HIF-mediated
   gene expression. In this report, we cloned the human orthologs of the
   mouse WAS gene, IPASH1 and IPASH2, to further study the regulatory
   mechanism of HIF-1 by the WAS proteins. The human WAS proteins inhibited
   the transactivation function of HIF-1 alpha under hypoxic conditions. In
   addition, human IPAS proteins blocked the hypoxia-induced VEGF
   expression and inhibited cell migration and tube formation of human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells. Interestingly, both HIF-1 alpha and
   HIF-1 beta interacted with the WAS proteins. Collectively, these results
   suggest that human WAS proteins inhibit angiogenesis by binding to and
   inhibiting HIF-1 alpha and HIF-1 beta. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A condensation of 2,4-bis(phenylhydroxymethyl)furan with pyrrole and

   5,20-diphenyl-10,15-di(p-tolyl)-2-oxa-3-ethoxy-3-hydro-21-carbaporphyrin
   {[}(H,EtO)OCPH]H-2. The new carbaporphyrinoid has H-1 NMR features of an
   aromatic molecule, including the upfield shift of the inner H(21) atom
   (-5.48 ppm). Addition of acid removes the ethoxy substituent and
   converts {[}(H,EtO)OCPH]H-2 into the dication of ``true{''} O-confused
   oxaporphyrin \{{[}(H)OCPH]H-3\}(2+) via an exocyclic C(3)-O bond
   cleavage followed by an elimination of the ethoxy group as determined by
   H-1 NMR. Addition of ethanol, water, or pyrrole converts \{{[}(H)OCPH]
   H-3](2+) into {[}(H,EtO)OCPH]H-2, {[}(H,OH)OCPH]H-2, or pyrrole appended
   O-confused porphyrin {[}(H,pyrrole)-OCPH]H-2, respectively. The reaction
   of {[}(H,OEt)OCPH]H-2 with silver(I) acetate yields a stable Ag(III)
   complex {[}(H,OEt)OCP]Ag-III substituted at the C(3) position by the
   ethoxy group and hydrogen. Coordination through the nitrogen donors is
   reflected by the presence of Ag-107/109 scalar splitting seen for the
   selected beta-H pyrrolic signals. Addition of TFA to
   {[}(H,OEt)OCP]Ag-III produces a weakly aromatic O-confused porphyrin
   complex \{{[}(H)OCP]Ag-III\}(+). In the course of this reversible
   process the tetrahedral-trigonal rearrangements originate at the C(3)
   atom but extend its consequences on the whole structure. Insertion of
   silver into the hydroxy analogue of {[}(H,OEt)-OCPH]H-2, i.e.,
   {[}(H,OH)OCPH]H-2, was accompanied by ligand oxidation, yielding
   carbaporpholactone which contains the lactone functionality instead of
   the regular furan moiety embedded in the carbaporphyrin ligand of
   {[}(O)OCP]Ag-III. The structure was determined by X-ray crystallography.
   The macrocycle is only slightly distorted from planarity, and
   silver(III) is located in the NNNC plane.}},

Abstract = {{We report an energy gap for hole photoexcitation in ferromagnetic

   Magnetization measurements reveal a moment of 3.9 +/- 0.4 mu(B) per
   substitutional Mn while the large anomalous Hall signal demonstrates

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{9345-9353}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Transformations of enynes upon treatment with electrophilic
   transition-metal complexes, such as PtCl2, are strongly
   substrate-dependent processes and may yield a wide variety of cyclic
   compounds. Despite the high versatility, many of these processes could
   be closely related from a mechanistic point of view. Theoretical
   analyses of the plausible reaction mechanisms provide support for a
   unified mechanistic picture based on the electrophilic activation of the
   triple bond by the catalyst, which triggers the nucleophilic alkene
   attack through an endo- or exo-cyclization mode, to form the
   cyclopropylearbene species. Then, these common key intermediates may
   evolve through alternative paths to afford a range of cyclic compounds.
   The preference for each path and the evolution of these intermediates
   are governed by the nature of the starting enyne. The effects induced by
   different structural motifs, such as the role played by a heteroatom
   directly attached to the triple bond, the tether length, the
   substitution on the acetylenic position, and the gem-dialkyl
   substitution on the tether, among others, are discussed. The proposed
   common mechanistic scheme can rationalize and account for the
   experimental observations accumulated.}},

   suitable for the gas-phase interactions, which start from a 1:1
   Br-2-alkyne pi-complex and do not enter into a 2:1 Br-2-alkyne

Abstract = {{Obesity and insulin resistance cause serious consequences to human
   health. To study effects of skeletal muscle growth on obesity
   prevention, we focused on a key gene of skeletal muscle named myostatin,
   which plays an inhibitory role in muscle growth and development. We
   generated transgenic mice through muscle-specific expression of the cDNA
   sequence (5'-region 886 nucleotides) encoding for the propeptide of
   myostatin. The transgene effectively depressed myostatin function.
   Transgenic mice showed dramatic growth and muscle mass by 9 weeks of
   age. Here we reported that individual major muscles of transgenic mice
   were 45-115\% heavier than those of wild-type mice, maintained normal
   blood glucose, insulin sensitivity, and fat mass after a 2-month regimen
   with a high-fat diet (45\% kcal fat). In contrast, high-fat diet induced
   wild-type mice with 170-214\% more fat mass than transgenic mice and
   developed impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Insulin
   signaling, measured by Akt phosphorylation, was significantly elevated
   by 144\% in transgenic mice over wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet.
   Interestingly, high-fat diet significantly increased adiponectin
   secretion while blood insulin, resistin, and leptin levels remained
   normal in the transgenic mice. The results suggest that disruption of
   myostatin function by its propeptide favours dietary fat utilization for
   muscle growth and maintenance. An increased secretion of adiponectin may
   promote energy partition toward skeletal muscles, suggesting that a
   beneficial interaction between muscle and adipose tissue play a role in
   preventing obesity and insulin resistance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We study signatures of heavy Majorana neutrinos at e(-)gamma colliders.
   Since these particles violate lepton number, they can give rise to the
   reactions e(-) gamma -> W-W- e(+) and e(-) gamma -> W+ mu(-) mu(-) v.
   The Standard Model background contains extra light neutrinos that escape
   detection, and can be reduced to an unobservable level after imposing
   appropriate kinematical cuts. We analyze the physics potential of an
   e(-) gamma collider, with centre of mass energies root s = 0.5-1 TeV and
   a total integrated luminosity of 100 fb(-1), for detecting heavy
   Majorana neutrinos with masses m(N) = 100-400 GeV. Assuming that heavy
   neutrinos couple predominantly to only one lepton flavour at a time, we
   find that 10 expected background-free events can be established for a
   WeN-coupling vertical bar B-eN vertical bar greater than or similar to
   4.6 x 10(-3) or for a W mu N-coupling vertical bar B-mu N vertical bar

   between a non-uniform electric field and its induced dipole moment in
   the particle. With the advent of the fabrication technology at
   micro/nanoscale, dielectrophoresis is actively applied in manipulating,
   separating, and characterizing micro/nano-sized particles such as DNA,
   cells, proteins, nanotubes and nanoparticles. In this paper we introduce
   control engineers to dielectrophoresis by suggesting several possible
   research topics and performing a case study: a time-optimal control of a
   dielectrophoretic system with a state constraint. Copyright (c) 2005

Abstract = {{A novel capsule system composed of sodium cellulose sulfate (NaCS),
   carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and poly {[}dimethyl (diallyl) ammonium
   chloride] (PDMDAAC) was prepared for improving the properties of
   NaCS/PDMDAAC capsules. The process parameters, such as CMC concentration
   (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 g/L), NaCS concentration (20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 g/L),
   PDMDAAC concentration (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 g/L), reaction time
   and temperature were investigated to understand their effects on the
   diameter, membrane thickness and mechanical strength of capsules. The
   optimum operation conditions for preparing NaCS-CMC/PDMDAAC capsules
   were determined as 6-8 g/L CMC, 35-40 g/L NaCS, 60 g/L PDMDAAC and
   polymerization for 30-40 min. Diffusion of substances with low molecular
   weight into capsules was investigated, and diffusion coefficients were
   calculated according to the developed model. The yeast of Candida krusei
   was chosen as representative cell to evaluate the effects of different
   cell loading on capsule mechanical strength. Meanwhile the encapsulated
   osmophilic C. krusei cells were cultured in 250 mL shaking flasks for 72
   h to determine the cell leaking proper-ties in short and long term. (c)

Abstract = {{A 5-day aquatic toxicity test based on sporulation inhibition of the
   green macroalga Ulva pertusa Kjellman has been developed. Optimal test
   conditions determined for photon irradiance, salinity and temperature
   were 60-200 mu mol photons m(-2)s(-1), 25-35\%o and 15-20 degrees C,
   respectively. Tests were conducted by exposing U. pertusa thallus disks
   to a reference toxicant (sodium dodecyl sulfate; SDS), metals (Cd2+,
   Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+) and elutriates of sludge collected from nine different
   locations. The EC50 values for SDS was 5.35 mg L-1. When four heavy
   metals were assayed, the NOECs were highest for lead (0.625 mg L-1) and
   lowest for copper (0.031 mg L-1). The EC50 values showed the following
   toxicity rankings: CU2+ (0.061 mg L-1) > Cd2+ (0.326 mg L-1)> Zn2+
   (0.738 mg L-1) > Ph2+ (0.877 mg L-1). The bioassay indicated also that
   the sporulation endpoint could be a sensitive indicator of toxicity
   effects of elutriates of sludge as reflected from the NOEC values equal
   to or lower than the lowest concentration employed (6.25\%). Sporulation
   was significantly inhibitied in all elutriates with the greatest and
   least effects observed in elutriates of sludge from industrial waste
   (EC50 6.78\%) and filtration bed (EC50 15.0\%), respectively. The
   results of the Spearman rank correlation analysis for EC50 data versus
   the concentrations of toxicants in the sludge presented a significant
   correlation between toxicity and four heavy metals (Cd2+, Cu2+, Pb2+,
   Zn2+). Introduction of the concept of toxicity unit (TU) showed that
   these metals were the main cause of toxicity in elutriates of at least
   four out of nine sludge samples. Members of the order Ulvales show a
   wide geographic distribution and have similar reproductive
   characteristics, thus making it possible to apply the present test
   method to other algae of this taxa, elsewhere. This novel method will be
   a useful tool for assessing the aquatic toxicity of a wide range of
   toxicants, once the respective sensitivities are demonstrated. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{We present spectroscopic abundance analyses of three main-sequence B

   targets have projected rotational velocities around 130 km s(-1).
   Techniques are presented that allow the derivation of stellar parameters
   and chemical abundances in spite of these high v sin i values. Together
   with previous analyses of stars in this cluster, we find no evidence
   among the main-sequence stars for effects due to rotational mixing up to
   v sin i approximate to 130 km s(-1). Unless the equatorial rotational
   velocities are significantly larger than the v sin i values, this
   finding is probably in line with theoretical expectations. NGC 2004/
   B30, a star of uncertain evolutionary status located in the blue
   Hertzsprung gap, clearly shows signs of mixing in its atmosphere. To
   verify the effects due to rotational mixing will therefore require
   homogeneous analysis of statistically significant samples of

Abstract = {{Causes of disruption of rainfall (break in monsoon conditions) over the
   Indian subcontinent during the monsoon months for the period 1979-1998
   are investigated using pentad rainfall data from the Global
   Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). Most (about 73\%) of the break
   in monsoon (BM) events were associated with convective activity
   (rainfall more than 30 mm/pentad) over the equatorial trough (ET)
   region. The association between these events and the convective activity
   over the western (WET) and eastern equatorial trough (EET) regions of
   the tropical Indian Ocean were further explored. These relationships
   were tested for different (deficit, normal and excess) monsoon
   conditions over the Indian subcontinent and the El Nino conditions in
   the Pacific Ocean. There appears to be a negative and significant
   correlation between the Central Indian Region (CIR) rainfall and EET
   during deficit and non-El Nino years. During deficit and El Nino years
   (1982 and 1987), both CIR and all India rainfall (AIR) exhibited a
   negative correlation with WET. In the case of years with no breaks, EET
   was negatively (positively) correlated during the years 1982 and 1992
   (1994 and 1997) with AIR. The convective activity was more intense over
   EET than WET during prolonged BM and also in a deficit and non-El Nino

Abstract = {{Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) is a critical regulator of innate and
   adaptive immune function as well as cell proliferation and survival. The
   present study demonstrated for the first time that a virus belonging to
   the Arteriviridae family activates NF-kappa B in MARC-145 cells and
   alveolar macrophages. In porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
   virus (PRRSV)-infected cells, NF-kappa B activation was characterized by
   translocation of NF-kappa B from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, increased
   DNA binding activity, and NF-kappa B-regulated gene expression. NF-kappa
   B activation was increased as PRRSV infection progressed and in a viral
   dose-dependent manner. UV-inactivation of PRRSV significantly reduced
   the level of NF-kappa B activation. Degradation Of I kappa B protein was
   detected late in PRRSV infection, and overexpression of the dominant
   negative form of I kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha DN) significantly
   suppressed NF-kappa B activation induced by PRRSV. However, I kappa B
   alpha DN did not affect viral replication and viral cytopathic effect.
   PRRSV infection induced oxidative stress in cells by generating reactive
   oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidants inhibited NF-kappa B DNA binding
   activity in PRRSV-infected cells, suggesting ROS as a mechanism by which
   NF-kappa B was activated by PRRSV infection. Moreover, NF-kappa
   B-dependent expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 was
   observed in PRRSV-infected cells, an observation which implies that
   NF-kappa B activation is a biologically significant aspect of PRRSV
   pathogenesis. The results presented here provide a basis for
   understanding molecular pathways of pathology and immune evasion

Abstract = {{Traditionally the Volterra time and frequency domain analysis tools
   cannot be applied to severely non-linear systems. In this paper, a new
   method of building a time-domain NARX MISO model for a class of severely
   SISO non-linear systems that exhibit subharmonics is introduced and it
   is shown how this allows the Volterra time and frequency domain analysis
   to be extended to this class of non-linear systems. The new approach is
   based on decomposing the original single input based on a Fourier
   analysis to provide a set of modified input signals which have the same
   period as the output signal. A MISO NARX model can then be constructed
   from the decomposed multiple inputs and the single output signal. The
   resulting MISO model is shown to meet the basic requirement for the
   existence of a Volterra series representation from which important
   frequency domain properties can be derived, explained and discussed.
   This is done by first introducing the derivation of generalized
   frequency response functions (GFRFs) from time domain MISO NARX models.
   The steady state response synthesis problem using the input spectrum and
   the MISO GFRFs is then investigated in order to verify the effectiveness
   and accuracy of the MISO modelling approach for severely non-linear
   systems. Finally a new frequency domain analysis method is introduced
   for systems that exhibit subharmonic oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: It is uncertain how best to screen pregnant women for the
   presence of fetal Down's syndrome: to perform first-trimester screening,
   to perform second-trimester screening, or to use strategies
   incorporating measurements in both trimesters.
   METHODS: Women with singleton pregnancies underwent first-trimester
   combined screening (measurement of nuchal translucency,
   pregnancy-associated plasma protein A {[}PAPP-A], and the free beta
   subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin at 10 weeks 3 days through 13
   weeks 6 days of gestation) and second-trimester quadruple screening
   (measurement of alpha-fetoprotein, total human chorionic gonadotropin,
   unconjugated estriol, and inhibin A at 15 through 18 weeks of
   gestation). We compared the results of stepwise sequential screening
   (risk results provided after each test), fully integrated screening
   (single risk result provided), and serum integrated screening (identical
   to fully integrated screening, but without nuchal translucency).
   RESULTS: First-trimester screening was performed in 38,167 patients; 117
   had a fetus with Down's syndrome. At a 5 percent false positive rate,
   the rates of detection of Down's syndrome were as follows: with
   first-trimester combined screening, 87 percent, 85 percent, and 82
   percent for measurements performed at 11, 12, and 13 weeks,
   respectively; with second-trimester quadruple screening, 81 percent;
   with stepwise sequential screening, 95 percent; with serum integrated
   screening, 88 percent; and with fully integrated screening with
   first-trimester measurements performed at 11 weeks, 96 percent. Paired
   comparisons found significant differences between the tests, except for
   the comparison between serum integrated screening and combined
   screening.
   CONCLUSIONS: First-trimester combined screening at 11 weeks of gestation
   is better than second-trimester quadruple screening but at 13 weeks has
   results similar to second-trimester quadruple screening. Both stepwise
   sequential screening and fully integrated screening have high rates of
   detection of Down's syndrome, with low false positive rates.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{We discuss the polar field precursor method of solar activity
   forecasting, first developed 3 decades ago. Using this method the peak
   amplitude of the next solar cycle ( 24) is estimated at 124 +/- 30 in
   terms of smoothed F10.7 Radio Flux and 80 +/- 30 in terms of smoothed
   international or Zurich Sunspot number (Ri or Rz). This may be regarded
   as a ``fair space weather'' long term forecast. To support this
   prediction, direct measurements are obtained from the Wilcox and Mount
   Wilson Solar Observatories. Additionally, coronal features do not show
   the characteristics of well-formed polar coronal holes associated with
   typical solar minima, but rather resemble stunted polar field levels.
   The question is raised: why have the Sun's polar fields not strengthened
   comparably in the 2000 - 2005 time period, as in the previous few
   decades? The dramatic field changes seen suggest the importance of field
   motions associated with photospheric ( e. g. meridional) flows for the
   Sun's dynamo. Flows may also play a role in active region development,
   e. g., it is possible that field magnification occurs through surface
   processes, namely active region field strengthening ( sunspot growth)
   through the influx of like photospheric magnetic regions, and even the
   influx of ERs ( ephemeral regions), wherein the same sign ( like) flux
   could be differentially drawn into spots of that sign, leading to field
   growth.}},

   Fe into MCM-48 materials barely improved the hydrothermal stability of
   MCM-48 materials. The effect of adding NaF was much more efficient in
   enhancement of hydrothermal stability than that of the incorporation of
   Ce. The addition of fluoride ions mainly improves the degree of
   polymerization of silicates. The Ce4(+) ions in Ce-MCM-48 appear to be

Abstract = {{The oxidation mechanism of aldehydes, which are commonly used as

   Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The reaction pathway of
   the three aldehydes, i.e., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and glyoxylic
   acid, with different functional groups, were examined by calculating
   energy profiles of all intermediate species. It was indicated that the
   pathway in an isolated system proceeds via dianion-free intermediate
   species. Taking the solvation effect into consideration, it was
   indicated that the oxidation reactions of the three aldehydes preferably
   proceed at the solid/liquid interface. In combination with a Cu metal
   cluster as a model of metal surface, it was also indicated that the
   oxidation reactions proceed preferentially at the Cu surface. It was
   expected that the adsorption/desorption energy at the Cu surface of
   glyoxylic acid, which has an electron-accepting carboxyl group, was
   smaller and substituent effect lead to its high reducibility. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{A dual hybrid ion-neutral trap has been built to study collisions
   between a cloud of ultracold atoms and small numbers of co-trapped
   atomic or molecular ions, in a common volume. Ultracold Na atoms are
   trapped in a vapour-cell magneto-optical trap (MOT), via a single-mode
   frequency-stabilized ring-dye laser, with repumping. A linear rf
   quadrupole Paul ion trap, centred on the MOT, co-traps selected atomic
   or molecular ions, for example Ca+. Control of the initial ion
   temperature involves laser cooling Ca+ ions via the resonant Fraunhofer
   K line at 397 nm. We showed the rf ion trap can operate simultaneously
   with the MOT without destroying the ultracold atom cloud. The goal is to
   investigate the physics of ion-neutral sympathetic cooling, the cooling
   by neutrals of translationally cold and vibrorotationally hot molecular
   ions (e. g. Na-2(+)( v{*}, J{*})), and the observation of other
   ion-neutral processes near 0 K, of potential interest in astrophysics.}},

Abstract = {{Three different methods of measuring cosmology with gamma-ray bursts
   (GRBs) have been proposed since a relation between the gamma-ray energy
   E-gamma of a GRB jet and the peak energy E-p of the nu F-nu spectrum in
   the burst frame was reported by Ghirlanda and coauthors. In method I, to
   calculate the probability for a favored cosmology, only the contribution
   of the E-gamma-E-p relation that is already best-fitted for this
   cosmology is considered. We apply this method to a sample of 17 GRBs and
   obtain the mass density Omega(M) = 0.15(-0.13)(+0.45) (1 sigma) for a
   flat Lambda CDM universe. In method II, to calculate the probability for
   some certain cosmology, contributions of all the possible E-gamma-E-p
   relations that are best-fitted for their corresponding cosmologies are
   taken into account. With this method, we find a constraint on the mass
   density 0.14 < Omega(M) < 0.69 (1 sigma) for a flat universe. In method
   III, to obtain the probability for some cosmology, contributions of all
   the possible E-gamma-E-p relations associated with their unequal weights
   are considered. With this method, we obtain an inspiring constraint on
   the mass density 0.16 < Omega(M) < 0.45 (1 sigma) for a flat universe
   and chi(2)(dof) = 19.08/15 = 1.27 for the concordance model of Omega(M)
   = 0.27. Compared with the previous two methods, method III makes the
   observed 17 GRBs place much more stringent confidence intervals at the
   same confidence levels. Furthermore, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation
   and use a larger sample to investigate the cosmographic capabilities of
   GRBs with different methods. We find that a larger GRB sample could be
   used to effectively measure cosmology, no matter whether the E-gamma-E-p
   relation is calibrated by low-z bursts or not. Ongoing observations of
   GRBs in the Swift era are expected to make the cosmological utility of
   GRBs progress from its babyhood into childhood.}},

Abstract = {{Pure MCM-22 with a high crystalline was hydrothermally synthesized by
   dynamic and static methods, respectively. The influence of the synthesis
   conditions on the structure and properties of MCM-22 was studied by
   means of N-2 adsorption, XRD, TEM and FTIR. MCM-22 synthesized by
   dynamic method shows much smaller crystal and lower concentration of
   acid sites than those of synthesized by static method. The Pd-supported
   catalyst on MCM-22 synthesized by static method shows a higher acetone
   conversion than that prepared by dynamic method in one-step synthesis of
   methyl isobutyl ketone(MIBK) from acetone. We attributed this to the
   higher concentration of acid sites of MCM-22 synthesized by static
   method. While the selectivity to MIBK exhibited an adverse trend, this
   might be due to shorter distance of the channel, which decreased the
   contact time of the reactants in the channels. As a result, the
   selectivities of the further condensation and hydrogenation products
   decreased.}},

   intercalated nanocomposite with the d-spacing of about 1.5 nm can be
   obtained at a high loading of a-ZrP(mass fraction >= 10\%). At the same

Abstract = {{The synthesis of organic compounds using polymer-supported catalysts,
   reagents, and/or scavengers, so that the required product is always in
   solution, has been of great interest in recent years, especially in
   connection with pharmaceutical research. To date, the reactions have
   almost always been carried out in batch mode. It is now timely to
   consider developing them further and carrying them out using flow
   systems. Advantages of flow systems typically include the following:
   there is little or no reaction workup, the support suffers no physical
   damage in use, automation is relatively easy, and extension to
   continuous production, even on a large scale, is a possibility. This
   paper gives a brief background on previous work using polymer-supported
   catalysts, reagents, and/or scavengers and then reviews in detail the
   work that has been done to date using these reactants in flow systems.
   It identifies some of the problems encountered and indicates how they
   might be solved. Rapid progress requires collaborations between organic
   chemists, polymer chemists, and chemical engineers.}},

   hindrance induced by bulky IPA and tert-butyl alcohol molecules.

   impressively for the pervaporation dehydration of ethanol/water

Abstract = {{Context Adequate vitamin D status for optimum bone health has received
   increased recognition in recent years; however, the ideal intake is not
   known. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the generally accepted indicator of
   vitamin D status, but no Universal reference level has been reached.
   Objective To investigate the relative importance of high calcium intake
   and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D for calcium homeostasis, as determined by
   serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH).
   Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional study of 2310 healthy
   Icelandic adults who were divided equally into 3 age groups (30-45
   years, 50-65 years, or 70-85 years) and recruited from February 2001 to
   January 2003. They were administered a semi-quantitative food frequency
   questionnaire, which assessed vitamin D and calcium intake. Participants
   were further divided into groups according to calcium intake (<800 mg/d,
   800-1200 mg/d, and >1200 mg/d) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (<10
   ng/mL, 10-18 ng/mL, and >18 ng/mL).
   Main Outcome Measure Serum intact PTH as determined by calcium intake
   and vitamin D.
   Results A total of 944 healthy participants completed all parts of the
   study. After adjusting for relevant factors, serum PTH was lowest in the
   group with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of more than 18 ng/mL but
   highest in the group with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than
   10 ng/mL. At the low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (<10 ng/mL),
   calcium intake of less than 800 mg/d vs more than 1200 mg/d was
   significantly associated with higher serum PTH (P=.04); and at a calcium
   intake of more than 1200 mg/d, there was a significant difference
   between the lowest and highest vitamin D groups (P=.04).
   Conclusions As long as vitamin D status is ensured, calcium intake
   levels of more than 800 mg/d may be unnecessary for maintaining calcium
   metabolism. Vitamin D supplements are necessary for adequate vitamin D
   status in northern climates.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine if excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) can

   3,078 men aged 71 to 93 years in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study from 1991
   to 1993. All were free of prevalent PD and dementia. Follow-up for
   incident PD was based on three repeat neurologic assessments from 1994
   to 2001. Results: During the course of follow-up, 43 men developed PD
   (19.9/10,000 person-years). After age adjustment, there was more than a
   threefold excess in the risk of PD in men with EDS vs men without EDS (

   function, depressed mood, midlife cigarette smoking and coffee drinking,
   and other factors failed to alter the association between EDS and PD (OR
   = 2.8; 95\% CI = 1.1 to 6.4; p = 0.014). Other sleep related features
   such as insomnia, daytime napping, early morning grogginess, and
   frequent nocturnal awakening showed little relation with the risk of PD.
   Conclusions: Excessive daytime sleepiness may be associated with an
   increased risk of developing Parkinson disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Elevated hematocrit (Hct) contributes to blood viscosity and
   has an adverse effect in acute stroke. The authors investigated the
   influence of Hct on tissue fate using serial MRI in acute stroke
   patients. Methods: The effects of Hct on reperfusion, penumbral salvage,
   and infarct expansion in 64 patients presenting within 24 hours of
   stroke onset were measured. MRI was performed at baseline (< 24 hours),
   days 3 to 5, and 90 days from stroke onset. Results: Median Hct was 42\%
   with a bimodal distribution. There was a strong inverse relationship
   between Hct and reperfusion (Spearman rho = -0.74, p < 0.0001). The odds
   of major reperfusion (> 50\% resolution of the baseline
   perfusion-weighted imaging deficit) were significantly lower with
   increasing Hct (odds ratio {[}OR] = 0.53; 95\% CI = 0.97 to 1.00),
   independent of age, perfusion, and diffusion lesion volumes and
   recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) administration. There
   was a trend toward reduced penumbral salvage at days 3 to 5 with
   increasing Hct (p = 0.06, 95\% CI = -4.76 to 0.14). An increasing Hct
   was a significant predictor of infarct growth (OR = 1.26, 95\% CI = 1.00
   to 1.59), independent of baseline perfusion and diffusion volumes and
   glucose. The effect of Hct on reperfusion and infarct expansion was
   similar irrespective of rtPA administration (p = 0.31) and independent
   of smoking status. Conclusions: Higher hematocrit (Hct) values have a
   significant independent association with reduced reperfusion and greater
   infarct size after ischemic stroke. An elevated Hct may also be a
   potential physiologic determinant of reduced penumbral salvage.}},

Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Pheromones can have profound effects on reproductive physiology and
   behavior in mammals. To investigate the neural circuits underlying these
   effects, we used a genetic transneuronal tracer to identify neurons that
   synapse with GnRH (LHRH) neurons, the key regulators of reproduction. We
   then asked whether the connected neurons are presynaptic or postsynaptic
   to GnRH neurons and analyzed their responses to chemosensory cues.
   Surprisingly, these experiments indicate that GnRH neurons receive
   pheromone signals from both odor and pheromone relays in the brain and
   may also receive common odor signals. Moreover, feedback loops are
   evident whereby GnRH neurons could influence both odor and pheromone
   processing. Remarkably, similar to 800 GnRH neurons communicate with
   similar to 50,000 neurons in 53 functionally diverse brain areas, with
   some connections exhibiting sexual dimorphism. These studies reveal a
   complex interplay between reproduction and other functions in which GnRH
   neurons appear to integrate information from multiple sources and
   modulate a variety of brain functions.}},

Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Discharge is a master variable that controls many processes in stream
   ecosystems. However, there is uncertainty of which discharges are most
   important for driving particular ecological processes and thus how flow
   regime may influence entire stream ecosystems. Here the analytical
   method of effective discharge from fluvial geomorphology is used to
   analyze the interaction between frequency and magnitude of discharge
   events that drive organic matter transport, algal growth, nutrient
   retention, macroinvertebrate disturbance, and habitat availability. We
   quantify the ecological effective discharge using a synthesis of
   previously published studies and modeling from a range of study sites.
   An analytical expression is then developed for a particular case of
   ecological effective discharge and is used to explore how effective
   discharge varies within variable hydrologic regimes. Our results suggest
   that a range of discharges is important for different ecological
   processes in an individual stream. Discharges are not equally important;
   instead, effective discharge values exist that correspond to near modal
   flows and moderate floods for the variable sets examined. We suggest
   four types of ecological response to discharge variability: discharge as
   a transport mechanism, regulator of habitat, process modulator, and
   disturbance. Effective discharge analysis will perform well when there
   is a unique, essentially instantaneous relationship between discharge
   and an ecological process and poorly when effects of discharge are
   delayed or confounded by legacy effects. Despite some limitations the
   conceptual and analytical utility of the effective discharge analysis
   allows exploring general questions about how hydrologic variability
   influences various ecological processes in streams.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of methyl chloride and coadsorption of CH3Cl and D2O on
   Pd(111) surfaces at T=100 K have been studied under ultrahigh-vacuum
   conditions using femtosecond sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy
   in the spectral regions of CH and OD bands. On the bare Pd(111)
   substrate, the CH3Cl coverage dependence of the resonant SFG signal is
   consistent with a progressive molecular rearrangement starting at half
   saturation followed by the growth of two ordered monolayers in which the
   molecular axes are perpendicular to the surface. When CH3Cl is adsorbed
   on top of predeposited D2O on Pd(111), the SFG signals as a function of
   the CH3Cl exposure indicate that methyl chloride is adsorbed onto D2O
   through hydrogen bonding. On the contrary when the adsorption order is
   reversed the strong decrease of the CH3 signal as a function of the D2O
   exposure is explained by assuming that water molecules penetrate inside
   the CH3Cl layers, leading to the formation of disordered CH3Cl clusters.
   In all cases a nonresonant contribution due to molecular adsorption is
   observed and it shows a dependence upon surface structure and coverage
   significantly different from that of the resonant vibrational bands.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the LBA-SMOCC (Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in
   Amazonia-Smoke, Aerosols, Clouds, Rainfall, and Climate) 2002 campaign,
   we studied the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2),
   and aerosol particles from Amazonian deforestation fires using an
   instrumented aircraft. Emission ratios for aerosol number (CN) relative
   to CO (ERCN/CO) fell in the range 14-32 cm(-3) ppb(-1) in most of the
   investigated smoke plumes. Particle number emission ratios have to our
   knowledge not been previously measured in tropical deforestation fires,
   but our results are in agreement with values usually found from tropical
   savanna fires. The number of particles emitted per amount biomass burned
   was found to be dependent on the fire conditions (combustion
   efficiency). Variability in ERCN/CO between fires was similar to the
   variability caused by variations in combustion behavior within each
   individual fire. This was confirmed by observations of CO-to-CO2
   emission ratios (ERCO/CO2), which stretched across the same wide range
   of values for individual fires as for all the fires observed during the
   sampling campaign, reflecting the fact that flaming and smoldering
   phases are present simultaneously in deforestation fires. Emission
   factors (EF) for CO and aerosol particles were computed and a correction
   was applied for the residual smoldering combustion (RSC) fraction of
   emissions that are not sampled by the aircraft, which increased the EF
   by a factor of 1.5-2.1. Vertical transport of smoke from the boundary
   layer (BL) to the cloud detrainment layer (CDL) and the free troposphere
   (FT) was found to be a very common phenomenon. We observed a 20\% loss
   in particle number as a result of this vertical transport and subsequent
   cloud processing, attributable to in-cloud coagulation. This small loss
   fraction suggests that this mode of transport is very efficient in terms
   of particle numbers and occurs mostly via non-precipitating clouds. The
   detrained aerosol particles released in the CDL and FT were larger than
   in the unprocessed smoke, mostly due to coagulation and secondary
   growth, and therefore more efficient at scattering radiation and
   nucleating cloud droplets. This process may have significant atmospheric
   implications on a regional and larger scale.}},

Abstract = {{When the supply of beneficial mutations limits adaptation, bacterial
   mutator alleles can reach high frequencies by hitchhiking with
   advantageous mutations {[}1-9]. However, when populations are well
   adapted to their environments, the increased rate of deleterious
   mutations makes hypermutability selectively disadvantageous {[}6, 7, 10,
   11]. Here, we consider a further cost of hypermutability: its potential
   to break down cooperation (group-beneficial behavior that is costly to
   the individual {[}12-14]). This probably occurs for three reasons.
   First, an increased rate at which `cheating' genotypes are generated;
   second, an increased probability of producing efficient cheats; and
   third, a decrease in relatedness {[}15-18] (not addressed in the present
   study). We used Pseudomonas aeruginosa's production of extracellular
   iron-scavenging molecules, siderophores, to determine if cheating
   evolved more readily in mutator populations. Siderophore production is
   costly to individual bacteria but benefits all nearby cells.
   Siderophore-deficient cheats therefore have a selective advantage within
   populations {[}18]. We observed the de novo evolution and subsequent
   increase in frequency of siderophore cheats within both wild-type and
   mutator populations for 200 generations. Cheats appeared and increased
   in frequency more rapidly in mutator populations. The presence of cheats
   was costly to the group, as shown by a negative correlation between
   cheat frequency and population density.}},

Abstract = {{Thioredoxin f {[}TRXf) is a key factor in the redox regulation of
   chloroplastic carbon fixation enzymes, whereas glutathione is an
   important thiol buffer whose status is modulated by stress conditions.
   Here, we report specific glutathionylation of TRXf. A conserved cysteine
   is present in the TRXf primary sequence, in addition to its two
   active-site cysteines. The additional cysteine becomes glutathionylated
   when TRXf is exposed to oxidized glutathione or to reduced glutathione
   plus oxidants. No other chloroplastic TRX, from either Arabidopsis or
   Chlamydomonas, is glutathionylated under these conditions.
   Glutathionylation decreases the ability of TRXf to be reduced by
   ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase and results in impaired light
   activation of target enzymes in a reconstituted thylakoid system.
   Although several mammalian proteins undergoing glutathionylation have
   already been identified, TRXf is among the first plant proteins found to
   undergo this post-translational modification. This report suggests that
   a crosstalk between the TRX and glutathione systems mediates a
   previously uncharacterized form of redox signaling in plants in stress
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The suppressor of cytokine-signaling (SOCS) proteins act as
   negative-feed back inhibitors of cytokine and growth-factor-induced
   signal transduction. In vivo studies have implicated SOCS3 as a negative
   regulator of signaling downstream of gp130, the receptor subunit shared
   by IL-6-like cytokines. Mice lacking SOCS3 die at midgestation because
   of placental failure, and SOCS3 ablation in a cell-type-specific manner
   results in changes in the functional outcome of gp130 signaling in
   response to IL-6. In this study, we show that genetic reduction of
   leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) production by embryo-derived tissues is
   sufficient to prevent the placental defect. This establishes LIF
   signaling as a major physiological regulator of trophoblast
   differentiation in vivo. Mice deficient in both SOCS3 and LIF are born
   in predicted numbers and appear normal at birth but exhibit failure to
   thrive and high neonatal mortality. Adult SOCS3-null mice on a LIF-null
   background succumb to a spontaneous fatal inflammatory disease
   characterized by neutrophilia and inflammatory-cell tissue infiltrates.
   The disease spectrum mimics that seen in mice with a conditional
   deletion of SOCS3 in hematopoietic and endothelial cells, extending the
   evidence for a major role for SOCS3 in the homeostatic regulation of the
   inflammatory response and indicates that LIF is not required for this
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Background-For patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention,
   the administration of a clopidogrel loading dose ranging from 300 to 600
   mg is currently recommended. It is unknown, though, whether loading
   doses higher than 600 mg exert additional suppression of platelet
   function.
   Methods and Results-Sixty patients with suspected or documented coronary
   artery disease admitted to our hospital for coronary angiography were
   included in this trial. They were allocated to 1 of 3 clopidogrel
   loading doses (300, 600, or 900 mg) in a double-blinded, randomized
   manner. Plasma concentrations of the active thiol metabolite, unchanged
   clopidogrel, and the inactive carboxyl metabolite of clopidogrel were
   determined before and serially after drug administration. Optical
   aggregometry was performed before and 4 hours after administration of
   clopidogrel. Loading with 600 mg resulted in higher plasma
   concentrations of the active metabolite, clopidogrel, and the carboxyl
   metabolite compared with loading with 300 mg (P <= 0.03) and lower
   values for adenosine diphosphate-induced (5 and 20 mu mol/L) platelet
   aggregation 4 hours after drug administration (P = 0.01 and 0.004). With
   administration of 900 mg, no further increase in plasma concentrations
   of active metabolite and clopidogrel (P >= 0.38) and no further
   suppression of adenosine diphosphate-induced (5 and 20 mu mol/L)
   platelet aggregation 4 hours after drug administration was achieved when
   compared with administration of 600 mg (P = 0.59 and 0.39).
   Conclusions-Single doses of clopidogrel higher than 600 mg are not
   associated with an additional significant suppression of platelet
   function because of limited clopidogrel absorption.}},

   some cases, quinuclidine. pK(a) values for the corresponding anilinium
   ions are reported. The reactions of 1 and 4 are likely to proceed
   through nucleophilic attack by the aniline to yield zwitterionic
   intermediates which may transfer an acidic proton to the bases present
   to yield the anionic adducts 9 or 12 respectively In the formation of 9
   from 1 the proton transfer step is rate-limiting; however, the slower
   interconversion of 4 and its zwitterion leads to only partial
   rate-limiting proton transfer in the formation of 12. Results with
   substituted anilines including 2-substituted and N-methyl aniline
   indicate that steric effects are not a major factor in determining rates
   of proton-transfer in these systems. Contrary to previous reports no
   evidence was found for a strong interaction between 1 and Dabco in DMSO.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the influence of inorganic lead (Pb(II)),
   an environmental pollutant having nephrotoxic action, on the focal
   adhesion (FA) organization of a rat kidney epithelial cell line
   (NRK-52E). In particular, we evaluated the effects of the metal on the
   recruitment of paxillin, focal adhesion kinase, vinculin and
   cytoskeleton proteins at the FAs complexes. We provided evidences that,
   in proliferating NRK-52E cell cultures, low concentrations of Pb(II)
   affect the cell adhesive ability and stimulate the disassembly of FAs,
   thus inhibiting the integrin-activated signalling. These effects
   appeared to be strictly associated to the Pb-induced arrest of cell
   cycle at G0/G1 phase also proved in this cell line. (c) 2005 Federation

Abstract = {{Behavioral response to novelty in rats has been linked both to dopamine
   transmission in the ventral striatum, and to propensity to
   self-administer psychostimulant drugs. In order to probe the
   relationship between behavioral response to novelty and dopamine systems
   we have developed a behavioral model for correlation with positron
   emission tomography (PET) of dopamine transmission in brain of Gottingen
   minipigs. In the present study, we measured exploration of a novel
   object by recording the number of contacts, and duration of contact with
   a novel object, in groups of six male and six female adult minipigs. We
   hypothesized that these novelty scores would correlate with the
   amphetamine-evoked dopamine release in ventral striatum, measured 2
   weeks later in a PET study of the availability of binding sites for the
   dopamine D-2/3 antagonist {[}C-II]raclopride. There were significant
   correlations between duration of contact with a novel object and the
   amphetamine-evoked reductions in binding potential (Delta p(B)) in the
   left ventral striatum of the 12 animals; Comparison of results by gender
   revealed that the correlation was driven mainly by the male group, and
   was not present in the female group. We interpret these results to show
   that propensity to explore an unfamiliar object is relatively elevated
   in pigs with low basal occupancy of dopamine D-2/3 receptors by
   endogenous dopamine, and with high amphetamine-induced occupancy of
   released dopamine in the male pigs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Cancer may act as the etiological agent for natural selection in some
   genes. This selective pressure Would act to reduce the Success Of
   neoplastic lineages over normal cell lineages in individuals of
   reproductive age. In addition, human's relatively larger brain and
   longer lifespan may have also acted as a selective force requiring new
   genotypes. One of the most important proteins in both processes is the
   fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. A
   variety of other proteins, including PTEN, MAPK1, SREBP1, SREBP2 and PI
   are also involved in the regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis. We have
   specifically analysed variability in selective pressure across all these
   genes in human, mouse and other vertebrates. We have found that the FAS
   gene alone has signatures indicative of adaptive evolution. We did not
   find any signatures of adaptive evolution in any of the other proteins.
   In the FAS gene, we have detected an excess of non-synonymous over
   synonymous substitutions in approximately 6\% of sites in the human
   lineage. Contrastingly, the substitution process at these sites in other
   available vertebrates and mammals indicates strong purifying selection.
   This is likely to reflect a functional shift in human FAS and correlates
   well with previously observed changes in FAS biochemical activities. We
   speculate that the role played by FAS either in cancer development or in
   human brain development has created this selective pressure, although we
   cannot rule out the various other functions of FAS. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   orbifold as the resolved space approaches the orbifold limit. Our
   analysis also shows that not all possible fermion configurations on
   T-2/Z(2) admit such a simple resolution. We focus our study on a fermion
   coupled to a U(1) gauge field. It is explicitly shown how a resolution
   of the orbifold puts severe constraints on the allowed chiralities and
   U(1) charges of the massless four-dimensional fermions, localized or
   not, that can be present in the orbifold. The limit in which T-2/Z(2)

Abstract = {{Selection of recently formed B cells into the follicular or marginal
   zone ( MZ) compartments is proposed to occur by way of proliferative
   intermediates expressing high levels of CD21/35 and CD23. However, we
   show that CD21/35(high) CD23(+) splenocytes are not enriched for
   proliferative cells, and do not contribute substantially to the
   generation of follicular B cells. Instead, ontogenic relationships,
   steady-state labeling kinetics, and adoptive transfer experiments
   suggest that CD21/35(high) CD23(+) splenocytes serve primarily as
   precursors for MZ B cells, although their developmental potential seems
   to be broader and is influenced by environmental cues that are
   associated with lymphopenia. Furthermore, CD21/35(high) CD23(+)
   splenocytes share several key functional characteristics with MZ B
   cells, including their capacity to trap T-independent antigen and a
   heightened proliferative response to LPS. These observations challenge
   previous models of peripheral B cell maturation, and suggest that MZ B
   cells develop by way of CD21/35(high) CD23(+) intermediates.}},

   ports is below -30 dB across the bandwidth. Good broadside radiation

Abstract = {{The results of a study of isotopic fractionation of boron between
   silica-rich (LS) and borate-rich (LB) immiscible liquids in the system
   Si-B-Al-Ca-Na are reported. Partitioning experiments were performed on
   glasses produced by quenching immiscible coexisting Si-rich and B-rich
   borosilicate melt pairs that had been equilibrated at high temperature
   and separated with the aid of a high temperature centrifuge furnace
   {[}Veksler, I.V, Dorfinan, A.M., Dingwell, D.B., Zotov, N., 2002.
   Element partitioning between immiscible borosilicate liquids: a
   high-temperature centrifuge study. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 66,
   2603-2614]. Here B/Si and B-11/B-10 ratios have been determined using
   secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The determinations encountered
   unexpectedly strong matrix effect (up to 12 parts per thousand) due to
   contrasting chemical compositions of the immiscible melts. Employment of
   -60 V high-voltage offset (not used during routine SIMS B isotope
   measurements) effectively eliminated the initially observed matrix
   effect. With this improved SIMS technique, we obtained the result that
   the coexisting quenched immiscible liquids have the same B-11/B-10 ratio
   within +/- 1.2 parts per thousand (2 sigma) analytical uncertainty. Thus
   little or no significant two-liquid fractionation of 1013 and B-11
   isotopes was observed in the temperature range between 950 and 1350
   degrees C. This is despite the observation that significantly different
   proportions of trigonal vs. tetrahedrally coordinated B in these
   immiscible liquids have been determined by Raman spectroscopic analyses.
   The essential observations (i.e., a strong matrix effect and a lack of
   significant B isotope fractionation between the glasses) were both
   supported by independent thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS)
   analyses of one selected centrifuged pair. Those glasses showed no
   difference in B isotopic composition within the quoted 2 sigma
   analytical error of +/- 1.0 parts per thousand. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Poly(benzyl ether)-b-polystyrene dendritic-linear polymers were
   successfully synthesized using a dendritic chloric poly(benzyl ether)
   (G(1)-Cl, G(2)-Cl, and G(3)-Cl) as the macroinitiator through the atom
   transfer radical polymerization process. The structure and properties of
   the resultant polymers were characterizated by gel permeation
   chromatography, H-1-NMR, Fourier transform IR, thermogravimetric
   analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that the
   temperature, reaction time, molar ratio of the macromitiator to styrene,
   and the generation number of the macroinitiator have significant effects
   on the molecular weights, conversion, and polydispersities of the
   resulting polymers. These dendritic-linear block polymers had very good
   solubility in common organic solvents at room temperature. The terminal
   group (dendritic segments) of the polymers can affect their thermal
   stability. These dendritic-linear polymers after self-assembling in
   selective solvents (chloroform/acetone) formed core-shell micelles. (c)

   enhanced by cyclic heating and the cyclic and isothermal heating
   processes were compared. When the nitridation was conducted at various
   temperatures and times (1370-1420 degrees C for times up to 60h), the
   reaction rate of the cyclic process was three times faster than that of
   the isothermal reaction. This can be attributed to the cracking of the
   reacted Si3N4 shell during nitridation, which exposes unreacted liquid
   Si in the core. Cracking was found to occur by the internal stress
   resulting from the volume mismatch between Si3N4 and liquid Si. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe and complex psychiatric disorder with
   a significant genetic contribution. Previously, we found an association
   between AN and the 158Val/Met polymorphism of the
   catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in a family-based study of 51
   Israeli AN trios. In the present study, we extended the original sample
   to include 85 family trios {[}66 AN restricting (AN-R) and 19
   bingeing/purging (AN-BP) subtype] and performed a family-based
   transmission disequilibriurn test (TDT) analysis for five SNPs in the
   COMT and two in the adjacent ARVCF gene. Association was found between
   AN-R and several SNPs in the COMT-ARVCF region including the 158Val/Met
   polymorphism. TDT analysis of 5-SNP haplotypes in AN-R trios revealed an
   overall statistically significant transmission disequilibriurn (P <
   0.001). Specifically, haplotype B
   {[}COMT-186C-408G-472G(158Val)-ARVCF-659C(220Pro)- 524T(175Val)] was
   preferentially transmitted (P < 0.001) from parents of AN-R patients to
   their affected daughters, while haplotype A
   {[}COMT186T-408C-472A(158Met)-ARVCF-659T(220Leu)- 524C(175AIa)] was
   preferentially (P=0.01) not transmitted. Haplotype B was associated with
   increased risk (RR 3.38; 0.95CI 1.98-6.43) while haplotype A exhibited a
   protective effect (RR 0.40; 0.95CI 0.21-0.70) for AN-R. Preferential
   transmission of the risk alleles and haplotypes from the parents was
   mostly contributed by the fathers. No significant transmission
   disequilibrium of alleles or haplotypes was found for AN-BP trios. The
   risk and protective haplotypes may carry molecular variations in the
   COMT gene or its vicinity that are relevant to the pathophysiology of

   with a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of acetonitrile and
   phosphate buffer 50 mM containing 5 mM of sodium octanesulfonate, pH
   2.0, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min.
   The method was validated and showed good performances in terms of
   linearity, sensitivity, precision and trueness. Quantification limit was
   obtained at 0.05 mu g/ml for aqueous humor and at 0.1 mu g/ml for
   plasma. Finally, the proposed analytical method was used to measure
   penciclovir in clinical samples for a pharmacokinetic study, after oral
   administration of famciclovir. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Extracorporeal bioartificial liver devices (BAL) are perhaps among the
   most promising technologies for the treatment of liver failure, but
   significant technical challenges remain in order to develop systems with
   sufficient processing capacity and of manageable size. One key
   limitation is that during BAL operation, when the device is exposed to
   plasma from the patient, hepatocytes are prone to accumulate
   intracellular lipids and exhibit poor liver-specific functions. Based on
   hepatic intermediary metabolism, we have utilized mathematical
   programming techniques to optimize the biochemical environment of
   hepatocyte cultures towards the desired effect of increased albumin and
   urea synthesis. To investigate the feasible range of optimal hepatic
   function, we have obtained a Pareto optimal set of solutions
   corresponding to liver-specific functions of urea and albumin secretion
   in the metabolic framework using multiobjective optimization. The
   importance of amino acids in the supplementation and the criticality of
   the metabolic pathways have been investigated using logic-based
   programming techniques. Since the metabolite measurements are bound to
   be patient specific, and hence subject to variability, uncertainty has
   to be integrated with system analysis to improve the prediction of
   hepatic function. We have used the concept of two stage stochastic
   programming to obtain robust solutions by considering extracellular
   variability. The proposed analysis represents a new systematic approach
   to analyze behavior of hepatocyte cultures and optimize different
   operating parameters for an extracorporeal device based on real-time
   conditions. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel surface-wave antenna that realizes a
   low-profile configuration using a thin patch-loaded grounded slab, which
   has an in-phase reflection coefficient for plane waves, but no band gap

   this artificial ground plane, it works like a transducer that converts
   the energy from the feeding probe into surface waves in the ground
   plane. The propagation and diffraction of the surface waves generate a
   monopole-type radiation pattern. The attractive antenna height, which is
   less than 10\% of a typical monopole antenna, is desirable for
   wireless-communication systems. The performance of the surface-wave
   antenna is demonstrated through both the FDTD simulations and the

Abstract = {{Background The ADRA2B gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism is
   associated with various cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes. Large
   (C1) and small (C2) artery compliance, assessed by pulse wave analysis,
   is considered as sensitive markers or risk factors for cardiovascular
   disease. Therefore whether the ADRA2B I/D polymorphism is associated
   with C1 and C2 need to be investigated.
   Methods A total of 227 men and 243 women were enrolled in a Chinese
   family-based study. C1 and C2 were measured by pulse wave analysis.
   ADRA2B genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction.
   Statistical methods included generalized estimation equations and
   quantitative transmission disequilibrium test.
   Results The II (31.9\%), ID (46.8\%) and DD (21.3\%) genotype
   frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.73). The
   covariates selected by stepwise regression for C1 and C2 were age,
   systolic pressure and gender. The population based association analysis
   showed that C1 and C2 were not associated with ADRA2B genotype both
   before (C1 : P = 0.28; C2: P = 0.27) and after (C1 : P = 0.58; C2: P =
   0.18) the adjustment. The family-based analyses of 128 informative
   offspring showed that transmission of the D-allele was not associated
   with C I or C2, both before (C1 : P = 0.42; C2: P = 0.85) and after (C1
   : P = 0.31; C2: P 0.82) the adjustment.
   Conclusion The study do not support that the ADRA2B gene I/D
   polymorphism has a major gene effect on C1 or C2 in the Chinese
   population of current sample size.}},

Abstract = {{The magnitude of protein conformational space is over-estimated by the
   traditional random-coil model, in which local steric restrictions arise
   exclusively from interactions between adjacent chain neighbors. Using a
   five-state model, we assessed the extent to which steric hindrance and
   hydrogen bond satisfaction, energetically significant factors, impose
   additional conformational restrictions on polypeptide chains, beyond
   adjacent residues. Steric hindrance is repulsive: the distance of
   closest approach between any two atoms cannot be less than the sum of
   their van der Waals radii. Hydrogen bond satisfaction is attractive:
   polar backbone atoms must form hydrogen bonds, either intramolecularly
   or to solvent water. To gauge the impact of these two factors on the
   magnitude of conformational space, we systematically enumerated and
   classified the disfavored conformations that restrict short polyalanyl
   backbone chains. Applying such restrictions to longer chains, we derived
   a scaling law to estimate conformational restriction as a function of
   chain length. Disfavored conformations predicted by the model were
   tested against experimentally determined structures in the coil library,
   a non-helix, nonstrand subset of the PDB. These disfavored conformations
   are usually absent from the coil library, and exceptions can be
   uniformly rationalized. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{MPEG-PLGA diblock copolymers, consisting of methoxy polyethylene glycol
   (MPEG) and poly(L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), were synthesized by
   ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide and glycolide in the presence
   of MPEG as an initiator. Implantable wafers, using diblock copolymers as
   a drug carrier, were fabricated by direct compression method after
   freeze milling of the diblock copolymers and bovine serum
   albumin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BSA-FITC) as a model protein drug.
   The wafers prepared with MPEG-PLGA diblock copolymers exhibited initial
   burst in the release of BSA. The BSA release profiles from the wafers
   depended on MPEG-PLGA diblock copolymer compositions. The in vitro
   release of the BSA also correlated with the degradation rate of the PLGA
   part in the diblock polymers. The wafers prepared from diblock
   copolymers with an increased MPEG segment showed the more structural
   metamorphosis of crack form due to higher water absorption of MPEG
   inside the wafer, and induced faster BSA release. The wafers prepared by
   using MPEG-PLGA diblock copolymers in the presence of small intestinal
   submucosa (SIS) as a drug carrier additive exhibited controlled BSA
   release profiles, although the wafers exhibited release patterns with a
   lag time at the initial stage as the MPEG segment in diblock copolymer
   compositions increased. Thus, we confirmed that the MPEG-PLGA diblock
   copolymers could be used as a protein delivery carrier in implantable
   wafer form. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is applied for the selective

   ligand-exchange reaction. The detection is based on the specific release

   performed to optimize the method. The on-line coupling of a liquid
   chromatographic separation prior to the continuous flow ligand-exchange
   reaction enables the screening for high affinity ligands in complex
   samples. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by using several
   ligands with a different affinity for either Cu(II) or Zn(II) ions. The
   selectivity of the ligand-exchange detection method can be tuned by the
   choice of the reporter ligand. This is demonstrated by using either
   2,2'-bipyridyl or 5-methyl-1,10-phenanthroline as reporter ligands. (c)

   are substantially decreased in diabetic animals and rapidly restored by

   assays and an investigation of occupancy of the promoter were performed.
   The rate of transcription was substantially reduced in the diabetic rats
   and fully restored within 2 h after insulin treatment. In vivo
   footprinting revealed several areas of protein binding as shown by
   dimethyl sulfate protection or enhancement. The cAMP-response element
   was heavily protected in all conditions, including diabetes, feeding of
   dietary cholesterol, or statin treatment. Striking enhancements in
   footprints from diabetic animals were visible at - 142 and at - 161 ( in
   the sterol-response element). Protections at a newly identified NF-Y
   site at - 70/-71 were observed in normal animals and not in diabetics.
   This NF-Y site was found to be required for efficient HMGR transcription
   in luciferase assays. CREB-1 was able to bind the HMGR cAMP-response
   element in vitro and the promoter in vivo. This evidence supports an
   essential role for cAMP-response element-binding protein in

Abstract = {{Environmentally friendly starch biocomposites were successfully

   crystallite as a filler to reinforce glycerol plasticized starch (PS).
   The cellulose crystallites, having lengths of 350 +/- 70 nm and

   linters by acid hydrolysis. The dependence of morphology and properties
   of the PS-based biocomposites on Cellulose crystallites content in the
   range from 0 to 30 wt.-\% was investigated by scanning electron
   microscopy, differential scanning thermal analysis, dynamic mechanical
   thermal analysis, and measurements of mechanical properties and water
   absorption. The results indicate that the strong interactions between
   fillers and between the filler and PS matrix play a key role in
   reinforcing the resulting composites. The PS/cellulose crystallite
   composites, conditioned at 50\% relative humidity, undergo an increase
   in both tensile strength and Young's modulus from 2.5 MPa for PS film to
   7.8 MPa and from 36 MPa for PS film to301 MPa. Further, incorporating

Abstract = {{One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures of CdSe have been found to exhibit
   morphologies of nanowires, nanobelts, and nanosaws, but their synthesis
   is by trial and error. To meet the needs of large-scale, controlled, and
   designed synthesis of nanostructures, it is imperative to systematically
   find experimental conditions under which the desired nanostructures are
   synthesized reproducibly, in large quantity, and with controlled
   morphology. This article reports the first systematic study on the
   growth of 1D CdSe nanostructures by a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process
   by varying a wide range of experimental conditions. Over 150 experiments
   have been conducted to investigate the morphology dependence of three
   different types of nanostructures: nanowires, nanobelts, and nanosaws,
   over various substrate temperatures and pressures. The results of this
   work yield a road map for the controlled growth od 1D CdSe
   nanostructures. This research serves as a guidance and ``menu{''} for
   scaling up of the synthesis of CdSe nanostructures. This is a key step

Abstract = {{Changes in transcriptional regulation can be permissive for tumor
   progression by allowing for selective growth advantage of tumor cells.
   Tumor suppressors can effectively inhibit this process. The PMEPA1 gene,
   a potent inhibitor of prostate cancer cell growth is an
   androgen-regulated gene. We addressed the question of whether or not
   androgen receptor can directly bind to specific PMEPA1 promoter upstream
   sequences. To test this hypothesis we extended in silico prediction of
   androgen receptor binding sites by a modeling approach and verified the
   actual binding by in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Promoter
   upstream sequences of highly androgen-inducible genes were examined from
   microarray data of prostate cancer cells for transcription factor
   binding sites (TFBSs). Results were analyzed to formulate a model for
   the description of specific androgen receptor binding site context in
   these sequences. In silico analysis and subsequent experimental
   verification of the selected sequences suggested that a model that
   combined a GREF and a GATA TFBS was sufficient for predicting a class of
   functional androgen receptor binding sites. The GREF matrix family
   represents androgen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor and progesterone
   receptor binding sites and the GATA matrix family represents GATA
   binding protein 1-6 binding sites. We assessed the regulatory sequences
   of the PMEPA1 gene by comparing our model-based GREF\_GATA predictions
   to weight matrix-based predictions. Androgen receptor binding to
   predicted promoter upstream sequences of the PMEPA1 gene was confirmed
   by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay Our results suggested that
   androgen receptor binding to cognate elements was consistent with the
   GREF\_GATA model. in contrast, using only single GREF weight matrices
   resulted in additional matches, apparently false positives. Our findings
   indicate that complex models based on datasets selected by biological
   function can be superior predictors as they recognize TFBSs in their
   functional context. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the catabolism of heme to biliverdin, CO,
   and a free iron through three successive oxygenation steps. The third
   oxygenation, oxidative degradation of verdoheme to biliverdin, has been
   the least understood step despite its importance in regulating HO
   activity. We have examined in detail the degradation of a synthetic
   verdoheme IX alpha complexed with rat HO-1. Our findings include: 1) HO
   degrades verdoheme through a dual pathway using either O-2 or H2O2; 2)
   the verdoheme reactivity with O-2 is the lowest among the three O-2
   reactions in the HO catalysis, and the newly found H2O2 pathway is
   similar to 40-fold faster than the O-2-dependent verdoheme degradation;
   3) both reactions are initiated by the binding of O-2 or H2O2 to allow
   the first direct observation of degradation intermediates of verdoheme;
   and 4) Asp(140) in HO-1 is critical for the verdoheme degradation
   regardless of the oxygen source. On the basis of these findings, we
   propose that the HO enzyme activates O-2 and H2O2 on the verdoheme iron
   with the aid of a nearby water molecule linked with Asp140. These
   mechanisms are similar to the well established mechanism of the first
   oxygenation, meso-hydroxylation of heme, and thus, HO can utilize a
   common architecture to promote the first and third oxygenation steps of
   the heme catabolism. In addition, our results infer the possible
   involvement of the H2O2-dependent verdoheme degradation in vivo, and
   potential roles of the dual pathway reaction of HO against oxidative
   stress are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Polyphenolic nonahydroxyterphenoyl-containing C-glycosidic oak
   ellagitannins are found in wine as a result of the aging of this
   beverage in oak-made barrels. Once in the slightly acidic wine (pH
   similar to 3-4), some of these complex natural products such as
   (-)-vescalagin (1), but not its C-1 epimer (-)-castalagin (2), can
   capture grape-derived nucleophilic entities such as ethanol, the
   flavanols catechin (10a) and epicatechin (10b), the anthocyanin oenin
   (13b), and the thiolic glutathione (16) to furnish condensation products
   with retention of configuration at the C-1 locus. A computer-aided
   rationale of this high diastereoselectivity is given. These condensation
   products can contribute to the modulation of organoleptic properties of
   the wine, as evidenced by the 23 nm bathochromic shift color absorbance
   observed with the novel oenin-based anthocyano-ellagitannin (15b).
   Hydrolysis of 1 under solvolytic conditions furnished another novel
   compound that we refer to as vescalene (21), in addition to the known
   (-)-vescalin (18). Of pharmacological importance is the fact that most
   of these found-in-wine water-soluble ellagitannin derivatives are much
   more potent than etoposide (VP-16) at inhibiting top2-mediated DNA
   decatenation in vitro (top2 = topoisomerase II)). The known (-)-vescalin
   (18) and the novel vescalene (21) fully inhibited top2 at 10 mu m

Abstract = {{Familial Danish dementia is an early onset autosomal dominant
   neurodegenerative disorder linked to a genetic defect in the BRI2 gene
   and clinically characterized by dementia and ataxia. Cerebral amyloid
   and preamyloid deposits of two unrelated molecules ( Danish amyloid
   (ADan) and beta-amyloid(A beta)), the absence of compact plaques, and
   neurofibrillary degeneration indistinguishable from that observed in
   Alzheimer disease ( AD) are the main neuropathological features of the
   disease. Biochemical analysis of extracted amyloid and preamyloid
   species indicates that as the solubility of the deposits decreases, the
   heterogeneity and complexity of the extracted peptides exponentially
   increase. Nonfibrillar deposits were mainly composed of intact A
   Dan-(1-34) and its N-terminally modified ( pyroglutamate) counterpart
   together with A beta- ( 1 - 42) and A beta-( 4 - 42) in similar to 1: 1
   mixture. The post-translational modification, glutamate to
   pyroglutamate, was not present in soluble circulating ADan. In the
   amyloid fractions, ADan was heavily oligomerized and highly
   heterogeneous at the N and C terminus, and, when intact, its N terminus
   was post-translationally modified ( pyroglutamate), whereas A beta was
   mainly A beta- ( 4 - 42). In all cases, the presence of A beta-(X-40)
   was negligible, a surprising finding in view of the prevalence of A beta
   40 in vascular deposits observed in sporadic and familial AD, Down
   syndrome, and normal aging. Whether the presence of the two amyloid
   subunits is imperative for the disease phenotype or just reflects a
   conformational mimicry remains to be elucidated; nonetheless, a specific
   interaction between ADan oligomers and A beta molecules was demonstrated
   in vitro by ligand blot analysis using synthetic peptides. The absence
   of compact plaques in the presence of extensive neurofibrillar
   degeneration strongly suggests that compact plaques, fundamental lesions
   for the diagnosis of AD, are not essential for the mechanism of
   dementia.}},

Abstract = {{The monoclonal antibody GSLA-2 recognizes the sialyl Lewis(a) (sLe(a))
   epitope, which has an increased occurrence on mucin type glycoproteins
   of patients with colorectal carcinoma. GSLA-2 is therefore used in tumor
   diagnosis. To advance the understanding of this highly specific
   molecular recognition reaction, we have analyzed the binding epitope of
   sLea at atomic resolution using saturation transfer difference NMR. To
   compare, the binding epitopes of sialyl Lewis(x) (sLe(x)) and of four
   synthetic derivatives of sLe(a) were explored. Surface plasmon resonance
   experiments furnished thermodynamic and kinetic data. It is observed
   that all pyranose rings of sLe(a) are in contact with the protein
   surface, with the neuramic acid residue receiving the largest fraction
   of saturation transfer. In contrast, sLe(x) binds very weakly, though
   specifically to GSLA-2, with a different binding epitope. This study
   provides a comprehensive picture of the recognition sLea and explains
   the exquisite specificity of the antibody.}},

Abstract = {{To characterize silica polymorphs (silicas) in some
   kaolins,orthophosphoric acid digestion (240 degrees C, 15 min), and
   thermal treatment (1050 degrees C, 24 h) were applied to eight samples.
   The original, digested, and heated samples were examined by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD). Crystalline silica quartz (SiO2) was identified from
   the standard XRD patterns of the original kaolins; all contained quartz.
   On the other hand, hydrated partially crystalline silicas (SiO2 center
   dot nH(2)O), such as well-ordered opal-C and opal-CT, were not readily
   distinguished from high-temperature crystalline silica,
   alpha-cristobalite, using standard XRD patterns of the original kaolins
   because, sharp and intense characteristic XRD peaks (h k l = 1 0 1)
   centered near 0.4 nm for opal-C, opal-CT, and alpha-cristobalite
   coincided. In order to distinguish these silicas the XRD patterns of the
   digested and heated samples were evaluated. It was observed that the 1 0
   1 peaks disappear and sharpen in the course of digestion and heating,
   respectively. Because, the crystallinity of alpha-cristobalite does not
   change by these treatments, it was concluded that the kaolins contain
   opal-C and opal-CT or their mixtures in amorphous opal-A (SiO2 center
   dot nH(2)O), but not alpha-cristobalite, which is probably human
   carcinogen. Because, the crystallinity increases in order opal-CT and
   opal-C, the narrowing in width at half-maximum peak height (FWHM) 1 0 1
   must be more for opal-CT than opal-C by heating. Therefore, to
   distinguish opal-CT and opal-C from each other, the FWHM values before
   and after the heating process, were examined. Based on the results, it
   was estimated that six kaolins contain opal-CT in opal-A matrix, one
   kaolin contains only opal-A in a trace amount, and one kaolin contains
   non-opals. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) ceramic fibres with the
   nominal composition of 0.65Pb(Mg-1/ Nb-3(2/3))O-3-0.35PbTiO(3) have been

   dissolving the magnesium component, the mixed oxide method was used
   together with the traditional sol-gel method. To obtain crack-free
   fibres, pyrolysis was carried out at a very slow heating rate under
   specific atmosphere to control the organic burnout. The thermal and
   microstructural properties were investigated using thermogravimetric
   analysis, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The
   optimum sintering temperature is 1200 degrees C and yields a fibre with
   a final diameter of around 100 mu m. A si i1gle PMN-PT fibre has been
   poled and its electrical properties were measured. The properties of the
   fibre are found to be better than that of a ceramic disc. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{In this work, the C2F4(X(1)A(g)) + O(P-3) reaction was investigated
   experimentally using molecular beam-threshold ionization mass
   spectrometry (MB-TIMS). The major primary products were observed to be
   CF2O (+ CF2) and CF3 (+ CFO), with measured approximate yields of
   84(-11)(+7)\% versus 16(-7)(+11)\%, respectively, neglecting minor
   products. Furthermore, the lowest-lying triplet and singlet potential
   energy surfaces for this reaction were constructed theoretically using
   B3LYP, G2M(UCC, MP2), CBS-QB3, and G3 methods in combination with
   various basis sets such as 6-31G(d), 6-311+G(3df), and cc-pVDZ. The
   primary product distribution for the multiwell multichannel reaction was
   then determined by RRKM statistical rate theory and weak-collision
   master equation analysis. It was found that the observed production of
   CF3 (+ CFO) can only occur on the singlet surface, in parallel with
   formation of ca. 5 times more CF2O(X) + CF2(X(1)A(1)). This requires
   fast intersystem crossing (ISC) from the triplet to the singlet surface
   at a rate of ca. 4 x 10(12) s(-1). The theoretical calculations combined
   with the experimental results thus indicate that the yield of triplet
   CF2((a) over tilde B-3(1),) + CF2O formed on the triplet surface prior
   to ISC is <= 35\%, whereas singlet CF2(X(1)A(1)) + CF2O is produced with
   yield >= 60\%, after ISC. In addition, the thermal rate coefficients k(O
   + C2F4) in the T = 150-1500 K range were computed using multistate
   transition state theory and can be expressed as k(T) = 1.67 x 10(-16) x
   T-1.48 cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1); they are in agreement with the
   available experimental results in the T = 298-500 K range.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of H-1 NMR fingerprinting with multivariate analysis
   provides an original approach to study the profile of olive oil in
   relation to its geographical origin and processing. The present work
   aims at illustrating the relevance of H-1 NMR fingerprints for assessing
   the geographical origin and the year of production for olive oils from
   various Mediterranean areas. Multivariate (chemometric) techniques are
   able to filter out the most relevant information from a spectrum, e.g.
   for a classification. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out
   on the similar to 12,000 variables (chemical shifts) and four data sets
   were defined prior to PCA. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of the
   first 50 PC's was applied for classification of olive oil samples (97 or
   91) according to the geographic origin and year of production. The data
   analysis has been carried out with and without outliers, as well.
   Variable selection for LDA was achieved using: (i) the best five
   variables and (ii) an interactive forward stepwise manner. Using LDA on
   the external validation sets the correct classification varied between
   47 and 75\% (random selection), and between 35 and 92\% (Kennard-Stone
   selection (KS)) depending on geographic origin (country) and production
   years. A similar success rate could be achieved using partial least
   squares discriminant analysis (PLS DA). The success rate can be
   considerably improved by using probabilistic neural networks (PNN).
   Correct classification by PNN varied between 58 and 100\% on the
   external validation sets. Other chemometric techniques, such as multiple
   linear regression, or generalized pair-wise correlation, did not give
   better results. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{ICESat elevation profiles of tabular iceberg margins and the Ronne Ice
   Shelf edge reveal shapes indicative of two types of bending forces.
   Icebergs and shelf fronts in sea-ice-covered areas have broad (similar
   to 1000 m wide), rounded, similar to 0.6 m high `berms' and outer edges
   that slope down several meters toward the water. Bergs in warmer water
   have 2 to 5m `ramparts' with similar to 1500 m wide edge-parallel
   `moats' inboard of the edge. This latter pattern was first revealed in
   images from International Space Station (ISS) showing edge-parallel melt
   ponds on one iceberg just prior to its disintegration. Model results
   indicate the patterns are caused by hydrostatic and lithostatic forces
   acting on the ice face. `Berm' profiles arise from differences between
   ice and water pressure along the face. `Rampart-moat' profiles result
   from waterline erosion, creating a submerged bench of ice that lifts the
   ice edge. We use the results to discuss iceberg breakup at low

Abstract = {{The voltammetric behavior of vardenafil was studied on glassy carbon
   electrode using cyclic, differential pulse (DPV) and Osteryoung
   square-wave (OSW) voltammetric techniques. Vardenafil exhibited
   irreversible anodic waves over the pH range 1.00-12.00 in different
   supporting electrolytes. The current-concentration plot was rectilinear
   over the range from 4 x 10(-7) to 2 x 10(-5) M with correlation
   coefficient of 0.999. The wave was characterized as being irreversible
   and diffusion-controlled. The developed procedure was successfully
   applied to the determination of vardenafil in tablets and in spiked
   human serum. Furthermore, results obtained by the proposed method have
   been compared with high-performance liquid chromatographic method. (c)

Abstract = {{Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play an important role in gene
   transcription. Inhibitors of HDACs induce cell differentiation and
   suppress cell proliferation in tumor cells. Although many HDAC
   inhibitors have been designed and synthesized, selective inhibition for
   class I HDAC isoforms is a goal that has yet to be achieved. To
   understand the difference between class I HDAC isoforms that could be
   exploited for the design of isoform-specific HDAC inhibitors, we have
   built three-dimensional models of four class I histone deacetylases,
   HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8. Comparison of the homology model of
   HDAC8 with the recently published X-ray structure shows excellent
   agreement and validates the approach. A series of HDAC inhibitors were
   docked to the homology models to understand the similarities and
   differences between the binding modes. Molecular dynamic simulations of
   these HDAC-inhibitor complexes indicate that the interaction between the
   protein surface and inhibitor is playing an important role; also some
   active site residues show some flexibility, which is usually not
   included in routine docking protocols. The implications of these results
   for the design of isoform-selective HDAC inhibitors are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we showed that the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) underwent
   neurophysiological remodeling after injury to the primary motor cortex
   (M1). In the present study, we examined cortical connections of PMv
   after such lesions. The neuroanatomical tract tracer biotinylated
   dextran amine was injected into the PMv hand area at least 5 months
   after ischemic injury to the M1 hand area. Comparison of labeling
   patterns between experimental and control animals demonstrated extensive
   proliferation of novel PMv terminal fields and the appearance of
   retrogradely labeled cell bodies within area 1/2 of the primary
   somatosensory cortex after M1 injury. Furthermore, evidence was found
   for alterations in the trajectory of PMv intracortical axons near the
   site of the lesion. The results suggest that M1 injury results in axonal
   sprouting near the ischemic injury and the establishment of novel
   connections within a distant target. These results support the
   hypothesis that, after a cortical injury, such as occurs after stroke,
   cortical areas distant from the injury undergo major neuroanatomical
   reorganization. Our results reveal an extraordinary anatomical rewiring
   capacity in the adult CNS after injury that may potentially play a role
   in recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Perennial sea ice is a primary indicator of Arctic climate change. Since
   1980 it has decreased in extent by about 15\%. Analysis of new
   satellite-derived fields of winds, radiative forcing, and advected heat
   reveals distinct regional differences in the relative roles of these
   parameters in explaining variability in the northernmost ice edge
   position. In all six peripheral seas studied, downwelling longwave flux
   anomalies explain the most variability approximately 40\% - while
   northward wind anomalies are important in areas north of Siberia,
   particularly earlier in the melt season. Anomalies in insolation are
   negatively correlated with perennial ice retreat in all regions,
   suggesting that the effect of solar flux anomalies is overwhelmed by the
   longwave influence on ice edge position.}},

Abstract = {{Annual bands of a Porites coral from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands,
   eastern Indian Ocean, were analysed by radiocarbon for 1955-1985 AD. A
   rapid oceanic response of the site to bomb C-14 is found, with a maximum
   D C-14 value of 132 parts per thousand in 1975. This value is
   considerably higher than those for the northwestern Indian Ocean,
   suggesting that surface waters reaching Cocos are not derived from the
   Arabian Sea. Instead, D C-14 values for Cocos and those for Watamu
   (Kenya) agree well over most of the study interval, suggesting that the
   South Equatorial Current carries C-14-elevated water rather than
   C-14-depleted water westward across the Indian Ocean. This implies that
   oceanic upwelling in the northwestern Indian Ocean is spatially confined
   with little contribution to the upper limb of the global thermohaline

Abstract = {{The transcription factors Olig1 and Olig2 are closely associated with
   the development of oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage in the vertebrate
   nervous system, but little is known about their role in the human
   developing CNS. To test the hypothesis that they contribute to initial
   OL specification in humans, we studied the expression of Olig1 and Olig2
   in human fetuses at 5 - 24 gestational weeks (GW). Both transcription
   factors were present in well outlined regions of the ventral
   neuroepithelium at 5 GW, several weeks before oligodendrogenesis.
   Spatial differences in the expression of Olig1 and Olig2 along the
   neuronal axis suggest that they specify different subpopulations of
   progenitor cells. Olig1 was distributed rostrally, from the basal
   forebrain to the hindbrain, whereas Olig2 was also found in the ventral
   spinal cord. Furthermore, at 5 GW, Olig1 was coexpressed with vimentin,
   and Olig2 was coexpressed with a neuronal marker, microtubule-associated
   protein 2. With the progression of development at 15 GW, both proteins
   were present throughout the spinal cord and the
   ventricular-subventricular zone of the ganglionic eminences, whereas at
   midgestation ( 20 GW), they were also expressed in the telencephalic
   proliferative zones and the emerging white matter. Double-labeling
   studies revealed that early OL progenitor cells and radial glia
   expressed Olig1, whereas Olig2 was localized predominantly in mature OLs
   and a subset of neural progenitor cells and mature neurons. Thus, Olig1
   and Olig2 transcription factors in the human CNS are important not only
   for differentiation of the OL lineage, but they may also have a role in
   neural cell specification.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients admitted to hospital with unstable angina or non-ST
   segment elevation myocardial infarction have a high risk of death,
   re-infarction or re-hospitalisation within the next 6 months.
   International guidelines recommend an early interventional strategy in
   moderate-to high-risk patients with pre-discharge coronary angiography.
   In the UK, such patients admitted to district hospitals have
   traditionally been transferred to tertiary centres for investigation and
   treatment. Due to the large numbers involved and scarcity of tertiary
   centre beds, this results in long delays before transfer. The objective
   of this study was to determine whether diagnostic cardiac
   catheterisation in moderate- to high-risk patients could be safely
   performed in hospitals without on-site revascularisation and whether
   this strategy led to earlier discharge times.
   Methods: A retrospective audit was undertaken of all patients undergoing
   inpatient coronary angiography to a large district general hospital
   (DGH) after admission with a clinical diagnosis of unstable angina or
   non-ST elevation myocardial infarction over a 12-month period from April
   2002 to March 2003. The main outcome measures were complications arising
   from coronary angiography and number of bed-days saved by allowing
   earlier discharge.
   Results: 142 patients with non-ST elevation ACS who met `high risk'
   criteria underwent inpatient angiography locally. Significant luminal
   coronary disease was present in 76\% of patients but 49\% were treated
   medically and discharged early. 32\% of patients required transfer for
   percutaneous intervention (PCI) and 19\% were referred directly for
   surgery. There was a high revascularisation rate (43\%) even in patients
   who did not have elevated troponin levels on admission. No patients died
   or sustained a myocardial infarction as a result of angiography, and
   morbidity was minimal. Patients waited an average of 3 days for an
   angiogram locally, but transfer time to a tertiary centre was 9 days for
   PCI and 12 days for surgery. As almost half of all patients were
   discharged without requiring transfer for revascularisation, we estimate
   a total of 490 bed-days were saved over 12 months.
   Conclusion: Cardiac catheterisation in most `high-risk' patients with
   non-ST elevation ACS is safe in DGHs without on-site PCI or surgery and
   frees up large numbers of acute medical beds by selecting out only those
   patients requiring onward referral for revascularisation. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Zinc chelation and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have
   been explored as potential neuroprotective agents. However, it remains
   unknown whether NSAIDs and zinc chelation may converge on a similar
   cellular process. Using two-photon microscopy to observe hippocampal
   neurons labeled with a zinc-sensitive dye, we provide evidence that
   three chemically unrelated NSAIDs, niflumic acid, ibuprofen, and
   naproxen, acutely increase intracellular zinc stores from extracellular
   metal pools. Phospholipase A2 inhibitors triggered similar responses,
   suggesting that NSAIDs likely control zinc stores by their activity as
   cyclooxygenase inhibitors. These results provide evidence for a new link
   between cyclooxygenase metabolites and the mechanisms controlling

Abstract = {{An approximate solution for the problem of diffusion-reaction in an
   isothermal catalyst pellet when coke deposition occurs was developed.
   The approximation is based on the linearization of reaction terms,
   producing analytical expressions to evaluate concentration profiles

   can be extended to any form of reaction rate functionalities for the
   main and coking reactions. Coke formation from reactants (parallel
   coking) or products (consecutive coking) and deactivation functions
   dependent on the coke content are considered in pellets with slab,
   cylindrical and spherical geometry.
   In this work, first-order kinetics for the main and coking reactions and
   linear and exponential deactivation functions were evaluated. The
   approximate predictions of the concentration profiles and the
   effectiveness factors were compared with results obtained by the
   complete numerical solution. A good agreement was found for both
   parallel and consecutive coking, including the cases when low and high
   intra pellet diffusion resistances are present.}},

Title = {{Photocatalytic inactivation of bioaerosols by TiO2 coated membrane}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Indoor air pollution by microbial contaminants is increasingly receiving
   attention as a public health problem. Under a suitable environment, such
   as in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, airborne
   bacteria are able to proliferate and grow causing various allergies and
   illnesses. This can be particularly serious in tropical regions due to
   high relative humidity and warm temperatures all round the year.
   Application of photocatalysis using UV-A and TiO2 to inactivate
   air-borne bacteria is relatively new and systematic parametric study is
   required for the engineering design of a process based on this
   technology.
   This study investigates the effects of TiO2 mediated inactivation of
   various bacterial species in batch and continuous systems using
   different TiO2 loadings and radiation intensities. Gram-negative
   bacteria, E. coli and two Gram-positive bacteria, Microbacterium sp. and
   Bacillus subtilis were used for the inactivation studies. In both
   systems, inactivation rates of Gram-negative E. coli are higher than the
   Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Microbacterium sp. and the
   inactivation rates increased in presence of TiO2 for all bacteria.
   Depending on the type of bacteria, TiO2 loading and light intensity, an
   increase of 1.3-5.8 times in the inactivation rates was obtained from
   those in the absence of TiO2. The inactivation rates in the batch and
   continuous systems were reasonably comparable. Inactivation rates in the
   continuous system are somewhat higher than those in the batch system due
   to the unaccounted loss of bacteria via adsorption and settling on the
   reactor walls in the flow system. The study demonstrates an approach
   that can be used for the designing of large scale systems for the
   treatment of bioaerosol.}},

Abstract = {{Reaction pathways in the enzymatic formation and cleavage of the N-N and
   N-O bonds, respectively, are difficult to verify without the structure
   of the intermediates, but we now have such information on the heme
   a(3)(2+)-NO species formed in the reaction of ba(3)-oxidase with NO from
   resonance Raman spectroscopy. We have identified the His-heme
   a(3)(2+)-NO/CUB1+ species by its characteristic Fe-NO and N-O stretching
   frequencies at 539 and 1620 cm(-1), respectively. The Fe-NO and N-O
   frequencies in ba(3)-oxidase are 21 and 7 cm-1 lower and higher,
   respectively, than those observed in Mb-NO. From these results and
   earlier Raman and FTIR measurements, we demonstrate that the protein
   environment of the proximal His384 that is part of the Q-proton pathway
   controls the strength of the Fe-His384 bond upon ligand (CO vs NO)
   binding. We also show by time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy that Cu-B(1+)
   has a much lower affinity for NO than for CO. We suggest that the
   reduction of NO to N2O by ba(3)-oxidase proceeds by the fast binding of
   the first NO molecule to heme a(3) with high-affinity, and the second NO
   molecule binds to CUB with low-affinity, producing the temporal
   co-presence of two NO molecules in the heme-copper center. The
   low-affinity Of CUB for NO binding also explains the NO reductase
   activity of the ba(3)-oxidase as opposed to other heme-copper oxidases.
   With the identification of the His-heme a(3)(2+)-NO/Cu-B(1+) species,
   the structure of the binuclear heme a(3)-Cu-B(1+) center in the initial
   step of the NO reduction mechanism is known.}},

Abstract = {{The present study elucidates the role of alpha(1)-adrenoreceptors in the
   locus coeruleus (LC) using a dual-probe microdialysis in conscious rats.
   One probe sampled noradrenaline in the LC, whereas the second probe
   sampled noradrenaline in a main projection area, the prefrontal cortex
   (PFC). To investigate a possible tonic activation of LC neurons by
   alpha(1)-adrenoceptor, the alpha(1)-antagonist prazosin (10 mu M) was
   infused into the LC. Extracellular noradrenaline in the LC decreased to
   about 50\% of basal levels but no change of noradrenaline release was
   detected in the ipsilateral PFC. Next, the interaction between alpha(1)-
   and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors was investigated. Local administration of the
   a-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (100 mu M) into the LC increased the
   noradrenaline release in the LC to about 400\%, whereas noradrenaline
   release in the PFC rose to 150\% of basal levels. A similar effect was
   seen when the Specific alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor antagonist BRL 44408 (10
   PM) was infused: extracellular noradrenaline in the LC and PFC increased
   to about 400 and 120\% of the basal levels, respectively. When infusions
   of idazoxan (100 mu M) or BRL 44408 (10 mu M) into the LC were combined
   with prazosin (10 mu M), the excitatory effects of the
   alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists on the release of noradrenaline were
   strongly suppressed in the LC as well as in the ipsilateral PFC. It is
   concluded that alpha(1)-adrenoreceptors are involved in the regulation
   of LC activity. Apparently, alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors have
   opposite roles in their function as autoreceptors; on LC cells. (C) 2005

   further investigations plant materials were added at a level preventing
   lipid oxidation by >80\%. The oxidation was followed by measuring the
   formation of hexanal by headspace gas chromatography and the formation
   of protein carbonyls by converting them to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones
   and measured by spectrophotometer. It was shown that rapeseed and pine

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Accumulating data have demonstrated that the endothelin axis plays a
   role in the progression of many malignancies. Endothelin-1, which is
   produced by prostate cancer cells, can stimulate new bone formation. It
   can also act synergistically with a number of growth factors promoting
   cancer cells growth and proliferation. Over-expression of endothelin-1
   and diminished capacity for its clearance have been seen in prostate
   cancer cell lines. The highest concentration of endothelin-1 is found in
   patients with hormone refractory metastatic disease. Atrasentan (Xinlay,
   Abbott) is a member of a new class of drugs called the selective
   endothelin-A receptor antagonists (SERAs). The safety and efficacy of
   atrasentan in hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) have been
   evaluated in several clinical trials. Atrasentan demonstrated some
   efficacy in delaying the progression of disease and improving patients'
   quality of life while having an acceptable safety profile. An NDA for
   atrasentan was submitted in December 2004 for the treatment of patients
   with HRPC metastatic to bone. A response from FDA is anticipated later
   this year.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives were to determine if vigabatrin in late gestation affects
   fetal growth and causes alterations in amino acid concentrations in the
   mouse. A single dose of 450 mg/kg VGB in saline or a proportionate
   volume of saline was administered intraperitoneally (IP) to Theiler
   outbred (TO) mice on gestation day 15 and maternal plasma, placentae and
   fetuses were collected at different time intervals after treatment. VGB
   attained peak concentration in the maternal plasma and the fetus at 2 h
   after treatment and in the placenta at 4 h. At 12 It significantly lower
   concentrations of several amino acid including methionine were found in
   the placentae and fetuses in the treated group. After 24 h, no
   difference was seen in the plasma amino acid concentrations but in the
   placentae and fetuses a significant decrease occurred in some amino
   acids in the treated group. At 48 and 72h, a generalized increase in
   most amino acid levels occurred in the fetus and placenta but not in
   maternal plasma of the treated group although the fetal and placental
   weights were significantly reduced. VGB during late gestation causes
   fetal growth retardation accompanied by an initial disruption of amino
   acid supply followed by an increase in amino acid concentrations for the
   next 2 days. This increase did not help restore growth suggesting that
   early fetal period is particularly vulnerable to VGB-induced
   intrauterine growth retardation in the mouse. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Comparatively little is known of the cytogenetics of Waldenstrom
   macroulobulinemia (WM). This is primarily due to the low proliferation
   of the clonal B cells, which precludes conventional karyo-typing in many
   cases. Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH)
   gene at 14q32 are characteristic of many B-cell lymphomas and myelomas.
   Initial reports suggested that the t(9;14) was characteristic of
   lymphoplastriacytic lymphoma (the underlying pathological diagnosis in
   WM), but subsequent studies have failed to confirm the uniqueness of the
   translocation. To clarify this, we examined 69 cases of WM with
   interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and failed to demonstrate
   an IgH translocation in 67 (97\%). We conclude that IGH translocations
   are not a feature of WM, and the implications of this finding are

   ``average etch rate ratio versus track length{''} locus for track sample
   groups is depicted by means of squared diameters asymptotic method. Our

   track loci for the detectors from the pinhole or analyzers turn out to
   be split into two parallel streaks that have been interpreted as a
   proton-deuteron doublet. Data obtained using the Thomson analyzer
   clearly demonstrate the equal numbers of protons and deuterons for some

   intron 2, IL6-174G/C and TNF-308G/A genes with CINA. We analysed 29 CINA
   and controls by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment
   length polymorphism. Statistical analyses were performed using chi(2)
   test, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was investigated. All
   alleles analysed were in HWE in both populations. Similar frequencies of
   IL1B-511C/T, IL1B+3953C/T, IL1RN, IL6-174G/C and TNF-308G/A genotypes
   were observed in CINA and controls. These results suggest that cytokine
   polymorphisms associated with control of gene expression and protein
   levels were not associated with occurrence of CINA and were not
   responsible for the increased cytokine in CINA patients.}},

Abstract = {{Prerequisite for a successful long-term milk production in Germany is to
   work with profit.
   On account of very low producers' prices, the cost reduction of
   production plays a decisive role. The life productivity per cow is of
   outstanding importance. Science, breeding and estimation of breeding
   value have to concentrate even more on this aspect and find new
   approaches (productivity per day of life). Aim of breeding, overall
   index (RZG) and exterior breeding value have to be focused increasingly
   on economics. The selection and examination of bull mothers and the
   testing of progeny have to be adopted to future structures and their
   requirements.
   The breeding farm shall stipulate an inner-company breeding objective
   for its future conditions and demands using only bulls that meet the
   requirements of this objective. The suitable bulls are available in the
   ``German Holstein{''} race.}},

Abstract = {{A novel pilot-scale passively aerated vertical bed (PAVB) for the
   treatment of municipal wastewater was investigated. Two modes of PAVB
   operation were compared. In the first mode, ``continuous feeding,{''} an
   uninterrupted flow of wastewater was applied to the bed until clogging,
   followed by a ``rest period{''} to regenerate pore space. During the
   rest period only passive aeration was provided by recirculation of clean
   effluent through the bed. In the second mode, ``intermittent
   feeding,{''} a daily schedule of 8 h of wastewater flow to the bed
   followed by a rest period of 16 h was employed. The results indicate
   that continuous operation is advantageous over intermittent operation. A
   high COD removal rate of about 800 g/ml/day was obtained when the system
   operated in the ``continuous feeding{''} mode and the COD removal
   efficiency was about 50\%. Clogging of the bed with apparent ponding
   occurred at a free pore space of 30 to 35\% from its initial value.
   During both continuous and intermittent modes of operation, an
   irreversible clogging of 40\% was observed. Higher organic removal
   efficiency was achieved by operating three vertical bed units in a
   series. The overall average COD and BOD reductions in the vertical bed
   system were 83 and 88\%, respectively, with effluent CODt concentrations
   between 50 and 128 mg/L and BOD concentrations were between almost zero
   and 45 mg/l. In contrast to PAVB for tertiary treatment, no significant
   advantage was shown in using passive aeration when the PAVB was used for
   secondary treatment with a relatively large particle size (15 mm).}},

Abstract = {{Forensic psychiatry, as a medical specialty, perhaps understandably
   leans toward beneficence or welfare as its main ethical underpinning.
   However, the special nature of the art or science of forensic psychiatry
   makes it imperative that beneficence is not the only ethical principle
   that guides the `good' forensic psychiatrist. Indeed, the commonest
   ethical dilemmas in forensic psychiatry arise from a conflict between
   two ethical principles: beneficence, or promotion of welfare, and
   respect for justice. These two paradigms dominate discussions about the
   moral role and ethical duties of forensic psychiatrists and, in effect,
   give rise to two different practices in forensic psychiatry, each of
   which can also be said to have acquired a national identity. We discuss
   these competing principles and offer some thoughts about what this means
   for the ethics and values of forensic psychiatry.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a fatal disease with a mean
   life expectancy of 612 months. Since 1982, we have performed
   thoracoscopic talc poudrage (TTP) as a primary therapy in mesothelioma
   patients presenting with pleural effusion. As the survival data for our
   patients surpassed that of many published series, the patient data was
   analyzed to determine whether talc poudrage can be considered as a
   contemporary palliative option.
   Methodology: We reviewed all 26 patients with a final diagnosis of
   malignant pleural mesothelioma from our prospective database of 228
   consecutive patients who received thoracoscopy from the same physician
   for recurrent symptomatic pleural effusion. Patients were followed up
   until their death.
   Results: Mean survival after TTP was 23.8 +/- 16.3 months (median 19.4,
   range 2.9-68). Pleurodesis palliated dyspnoea in all patients. No
   perioperative deaths and one postoperative complication (pneumonia)
   occurred. Mean hospital stay was 3.9 +/- 2.7 days.
   Conclusion: TTP remains a safe, low-morbidity, inexpensive primary
   palliative treatment option for malignant pleural mesothelioma and a
   valid control arm option for therapeutic trials. TTP is ideal for
   patients who wish to avoid thoracotomy, long hospital stays and
   morbidity from multimodality therapy. Prospective randomized studies are
   needed to compare quality of life and survival after talc poudrage and
   other therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer metastasis predominantly occurs via lymphatic vessels.
   However, the study of lymphatic vessels and lyrnphangiogenesis has been
   hampered by lack of specific markers. Recently, antibodies directed
   against M2A (D2-40), Podoplanin, and Prox-1 that specifically mark
   lymphatic vessels in paraffin-embedded sections have become available.
   These were used to study lymphangiogenesis in archival paraffin sections
   of normal breast (n = 23), fibrocystic disease (n = 7), ductal carcinoma
   in situ (n = 32), invasive ductal carcinoma (n = 50), and invasive
   lobular carcinoma (n = 5). In addition, endothelial proliferation in
   lymphatic vessels was analyzed by dual-color immunohistochemistry with
   D2-40 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Expression of
   D2-40, Prox-1, and Podoplanin was seen in lymphatic vessels but not in
   blood vessels. Lymphatic vessels were seen in the peritumoral area and
   as ``entrapped{''} intratumoral vessels adjacent to preexisting normal
   lobules and ducts. Unlike angiogenesis, there was no increase of
   lymphatic vessel density in association with neoplastic transformation.
   On the contrary, a marked reduction in intratumoral lymphatic vessel
   density was seen in comparison to normal breast tissue, fibrocystic
   disease, and ductal carcinoma in situ (P = 0.0001). There was an
   increase in periturnoral lymphatic vessel density as compared with
   normal breast (P = 0.0001). However, the endothelial cells in the
   ``entrapped{''} or the periturnoral lymphatic vessels did not show any
   expression of PCNA indicating minimal or no proliferative activity. This
   was in contrast to the strong expression seen in adjacent tumor cells
   and blood vessel endothelial cells. Thus, lymph angiogenesis was not
   evident when studied by lymphatic vessel density or by lymph vessel
   endothelial proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal areas play a crucial role in the economical, social and
   political development of most countries; they support diverse and
   productive coastal ecosystems that provide valuable goods and services.
   Globally flooding and coastal erosion represent serious threats along
   many coastlines, and will become more serious as a consequence of
   human-induced changes and accelerated sea-level rise. Over the past
   century, hard coastal defence structures have become ubiquitous features
   of coastal landscapes as a response to these threats. The proliferation
   of defence works can affect over half of the shoreline in some regions
   and results in dramatic changes to the coastal environment. Surprisingly
   little attention has been paid to the ecological consequences of coastal
   defence. Results from the DELOS (Environmental Design of Low Crested
   Coastal Defence Structures, EVK3-CT-2000-00041) project indicate that
   the construction of coastal defence structures will affect coastal
   ecosystems. The consequences can be seen on a local scale, as disruption
   of surrounding soft-bottom environments and introduction of new
   artificial hard-bottom habitats, with consequent changes to the native
   assemblages of the areas. Proliferation of coastal defence structures
   can also have critical impacts on regional species diversity, removing
   isolating barriers, favouring the spread of non-native species and
   increasing habitat heterogeneity. Knowledge of the environmental context
   in which coastal defence structures are placed is fundamental to an
   effective management of these structures as, while there are some
   general consequences of such construction, many effects are site
   specific. Advice is provided to meet specific management goals, which
   include mitigating specific impacts on the environment, such as
   minimising changes to surrounding sediments, spread of exotic species or
   growth of nuisance species, and/or enhancing specific natural resources,
   for example enhancing fish recruitment or promoting diverse assemblages
   for eco-tourism. The DELOS project points out that the downstream
   effects of defence structures on coastal processes and regional-scale
   impacts on biodiversity necessitate planning and management at a
   regional (large coastline) scale. To effectively understand and manage
   coastal defences, environmental management goals must be clearly stated
   and incorporated into the planning, construction, and monitoring stages.

Abstract = {{Objective. A deficiency of pyruvate kinase (PK) is the most common cause
   of hereditary nonspherocytic anemia due to glycolytic enzyme defects.
   Red cells are poorly deformable due to adenosine triphosphate depletion
   in individuals with a PK deficiency and are destroyed in the
   microcirculation of the reticuloendothelial system, leading to
   extravascular hemolysis. The pathophysiology of PK deficiency has been
   widely studied in PK-deficient mice (PK-I-sIc). We examined the effects
   of a PK deficiency on erythroid progenitor maturation using these mice.
   Materials and Methods. The appearance of apoptotic cells in spleen of
   PK-1(slc) mice was examined by terminal
   deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)
   staining. We also assayed hematopoietic stem cell colony formation in
   vitro in the spleen of PK-1(slc) mice, to investigate erythropoiesis,
   and annexin V binding, as a measure of apoptotic cells in constitutive
   erythroid colonies, to evaluate the maturation of erythroid progenitors.
   Results. The number of hematopoietic progenitors including
   colony-forming unit erythroids, burst-forming unit erythroids (BFU-E),
   colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophages, and multilineage
   colony-forming units in the spleens of PK-1(slc) was remarkably
   increased indicating hematopoiesis, and enhanced erythropoiesis in
   particular. TUNEL assays identified apoptotic cells in the splenic red
   pulp of the PK-1(slc) mice. Two-color flow cytometry detected apoptotic
   cells among anti-TER119-positive cells, suggesting that apoptotic cells
   were of erythroid lineage. Cells undergoing apoptosis were detected in
   cultures of BFU-E generated from bone marrow cells of PK-1(slc) mice.
   Conclusions. The results in this study indicate that the metabolic
   disturbance in PK deficiency alters not only the survival of red cells
   but also the maturation of erythroid progenitors, resulting in
   ineffective erythropoiesis. (c) 2005 International Society for

Abstract = {{Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are caused by infection with
   any one of the four dengue viruses (DVs) and are significant public
   health burdens throughout the tropics. Higher viremia levels are
   associated with greater dengue disease severity. A therapeutic
   intervention to suppress viremia early in DV infection could potentially
   ameliorate severe disease. Recombinant alpha interferon
   2a(rIFN-alpha-2a, Roferon-A) suppressed DV replication in human
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. We therefore examined the
   effects of rIFN-alpha-2a and pegylated recombinant IFN-alpha-2a
   (PEG-rIFN-alpha-2a, PEGASYS) on DV serotype 2 (DV-2) viremia in rhesus
   monkeys. Flavivirus-naive monkeys were inoculated with DV-2 and
   randomized to receive a single dose of rIFN-alpha-2a (10 million
   international units/m(2)) versus placebo or PEG-rIFN-alpha-2a (6 mu
   g/kg) versus placebo 1 day after the onset of viremia. Serial daily
   viremia levels were measured, and convalescent-phase DV-2 neutralizing
   antibody titers were determined. Compared to placebo, a single injection
   of rIFN-alpha-2a temporarily suppressed DV-2 replication and delayed the
   time to peak viremia by a median of 3 days. However, measures of total
   viral burden were not different between the two groups. A single
   injection of PEG-rIFN-a-2a significantly lowered daily viremia levels
   and improved virus clearance, starting 48 h after administration. There
   were no significant differences in DV-2 neutralizing antibody titers
   between the treatment and placebo groups at 30 and 90 days
   postinfection. Based on their individual effects, future studies should
   investigate a combination of rIFN-alpha-2a and PEG-rIFN-alpha-2a for
   suppression of dengue virus viremia and as a potential therapeutic
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Very early human pregnancy is a state of cardiovascular
   underfilling. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is directly concerned
   with sodium and water homeostasis. Angiotensinogen is known to be the
   rate-limiting component in the generation of angiotensin I, and hence
   angiotensin II, in pregnancy. The usual measurement of `renin activity'
   does not differentiate between enzyme and substrate. We hypothesized
   that the RAS is activated from the start of pregnancy; plasma renin
   concentration (PRC) and angiotensinogen will show differential
   regulation and might stimulate the rise in prostacyclin. METHODS: A
   prospective study of 12 nulliparous normal women. PRC and
   angiotensinogen and excretion of prostacyclin and thromboxane
   metabolites were measured pre-pregnancy and four to six times after
   conception to 13 weeks. RESULTS: By 6 weeks gestation, mean PRC was
   markedly raised and remained stable to 13 weeks. The initial
   angiotensinogen response varied, but rose consistently after 6-8 weeks.
   Regression analysis showed angiotensinogen in the first trimester to be
   strongly associated with corrected birthweight centile (P < 0.001).
   Excretion of eicosanoid metabolites was very variable, but rose
   significantly from 6 weeks; the ratio between prostacyclin and
   thromboxane excretion did not alter over this time. There was no
   correlation between the various hormones measured. CONCLUSION:
   Angiotensinogen is known to be rate-limiting in pregnancy. Its
   association with birthweight may be through effects on early plasma
   volume expansion and may have implications for intrauterine growth
   restriction and pre-eclampsia.}},

Abstract = {{The management of patients admitted with a fracture requiring surgery
   who are taking warfarin anticoagulation is unclear. We examined the
   anticoagutation management for 33 hip fracture patients on warfarin at
   the time of admission. Hospital course and complications were recorded
   on all patients. The mean INR on admission was 3.2 and prior to surgery
   2.2. Eight patients (24\%) had percutaneous cancellous screws for an
   intracapsular fracture regardless of the admission INR. In 21 (64\%)
   patients, surgery was delayed whilst the INR came down, with an average
   delay of 72 h from admission to surgery. No specific treatment to tower
   the INR other than wait and watch policy adopted in 11 (33\%) of these
   patients. Pharmacological methods used to reduce the INR were fresh
   frozen plasma in nine cases, and intravenous Vitamin K in four patients.
   One patient died from post-operative haematemesis and three died from

Title = {{Reliability and validity of adapted Turkish Version of Scoliosis
   Research Society-22 (SRS-22) questionnaire}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Outcome study to determine the internal consistency, and
   validity of adapted Turkish version of Scoliosis Research Society-22
   (SRS-22) Instrument.
   Objectives. To evaluate the validity and reliability of adapted Turkish
   Version of SRS-22 questionnaire.
   Summary of Background Data. The SRS-22 questionnaire is a widely
   accepted questionnaire to assess the health-related quality of life for
   scoliotic patients in the United States. However, its adaptation in
   languages other than the source language is necessary for its
   multinational use.
   Methods. Translation/retranslation of the English version of the SRS-22
   was done, and all steps for cross-cultural adaptation process were
   performed properly by an expert committee. Later, SRS-22 questionnaires
   and previously validated Short Form-36 (SF-36) outcome instruments were
   mailed to 82 patients who had been surgically treated for idiopathic
   scoliosis. All patients had a minimum of 2 years follow-up. Fifty-four
   patients (66\%) responded to the first set of questionnaires.
   Forty-seven of the first time respondents returned their second survey.
   The average age of the 47 patients ( 12 male, 35 female) was 19.8 years
   ( range, 14 - 31 years). The two measures of reliability as internal
   consistency and reproducibility were determined by Cronbach alpha
   statistics and intraclass correlation coefficient, respectively.
   Concurrent validity was measured by comparing with an already validated
   questionnaire (SF-36). Measurement was made using the Pearson
   correlation coefficient (r).
   Results. The study demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency with
   high Cronbach alpha values for the four of the corresponding domains (
   pain, 0.72; self-image, 0.80; mental health, 0.72; and satisfaction,
   0.83). However, the Cronbach alpha value for function/activity domain
   (0.48) was considerably lower than the original questionnaire. The
   intraclass correlation coefficient for the same domains was 0.80, 0.82,
   0.78, 0.81, and 0.76, respectively, demonstrating a satisfactory
   test/retest reproducibility. Considering concurrent validity, two
   domains had excellent correlation ( r = 0.75 - 1), while 9 had good
   correlation ( r = 0.50 to 0.75), and 6 had moderate correlation ( r =
   0.25 - 0.50). Based on these results, question 18 in the
   function/activity domain with lower Cronbach alpha value was revised
   while question 15 was excluded. The revised SRS-22 was given to 30
   adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients not included in the index
   study. The revision could improve the Cronbach alpha value for
   function/activity domain from 0.48 to 0.81.
   Conclusion. This study demonstrated that, if measures are to be used
   across cultures, the items must not only be translated well
   linguistically but also must be culturally adapted to maintain the
   content validity of the instrument at a conceptual level across
   different cultures. This may necessitate several validation studies to
   ensure and improve consistency in the content and face validity between
   source and target versions of a questionnaire due to difficulty in
   detecting subtle differences in the living habits of different cultures.}},

Abstract = {{Whether purchasing power parity (PPP) holds for the German mark
   (euro)-Turkish lira real exchange rate has significant implications on
   Turkey's prospects for joining the European Union (EU). As such, it is
   important to accurately test the empirical validity of PPP between the
   two currencies. To do so, we apply the methodology developed by Caner
   and Hansen {[}Caner, M., \& Hansen, B. (2001). Threshold autoregression
   with a unit root. Econometrica, 69(6), 1555-1596], which allows us to
   simultaneously consider non-stationarity and non-linearity. Our findings
   indicate that PPP holds for the lira-mark exchange rate in one threshold
   regime but not in another. They also provide stronger support for PPP in
   the most recent years. (c) 2005 Society for Policy Modeling. Published

   extended down to 10 cm when evaluated at 18 and 30 months after liming.
   Lime incorporation decreased the soil acidity to a depth of up to 20 cm

   influence the soil acidity in the subsoil (20 - 40 cm). Base saturation
   at 020 cm depth was lower than the estimated BS, even 30 months after
   liming. Manganese and Fe concentration decreased at 10 cm depth after
   surface liming and decreased at 20 cm after lime incorporation as a
   consequence of the pH increase. Still, the concentration of these
   micronutrients remained above the limit considered critical for plants.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen tube growth after selling was studied in four almond (Prunus
   amygdalus Batsch) families derived from crosses between self-compatible
   `Tuono' and self-incompatible `Ferragnes'and `Ferralise' in both
   directions, in order to ascertain the phenotypic expressions of the
   different genotypes. A differential expression of self-compatibility was
   observed in the seedlings of the different families. The genetic
   self-compatible offspring of `Ferralise' showed a lower percentage of
   pistils with pollen tubes at the style base and a lower number of pollen
   tubes at the pistil base after self-pollination than those observed in
   the self-compatible offspring of `Ferragnes'. This low level of
   self-compatibility expression observed in some `Ferralise' seedlings may
   be due to the inbreeding present in `Ferralise'. As a consequence,
   caution must be taken in almond breeding to avoid the increase of
   inbreeding by the utilization of related parents and to diversify the
   sources of self-compatibility, at present mostly limited to `Tuono.'}},

Abstract = {{The dispersion spectra of SH guided waves are studied both analytically
   and numerically for two-layered plates with a plane of propagation being
   the plane of transverse isotropy. The boundary-value problems are
   considered for a plate with free, clamped, or clamped/free surfaces. It
   is noticed that formally the problem is very similar to that for
   symmetric and antisymmetric Lamb waves in a homogeneous plate. On this
   basis the Mindlin's approach of a bound grid is applied for an analysis.
   It is found that the studied spectra are characterized by the following
   specific features. They have two asymptotic levels c(t1) and c(t2)
   corresponding to the speeds of SH bulk waves in both layers. In the
   vicinity of the upper level (c(t2)) dispersion curves form a step-like
   pattern tending to c(t2) in succession one by one with further going
   down to the lower asymptote c(t1). Over the level c(t2) there is a zone,
   where dispersion curves have a wavy form similar to that in spectra of
   Lamb waves in homogeneous plates. It is shown that the families of
   dispersion branches related to the boundary conditions of free and
   clamped surfaces cross each other at the same types of nodes of
   Mindlin's grid as those for symmetric and antisymmetric Lamb waves in a
   free homogeneous plate. The tracing speed level nu=nu(0) is found where
   the appropriate families of dispersion curves cross each other beyond
   the nodes of Mindlin's grid. It is proved that the spectra of symmetric
   and antisymmetric SH guided waves in symmetric three-layered plates with
   free or clamped faces are described by the same four equations as for
   the studied two-layered plates with free, clamped, free/clamped or
   clamped/free surfaces. (c) 2005 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{We estimate the value of three types of information about fire risk to a
   nonindustrial forest landowner: the relationship between fire arrival
   rates and stand age, the magnitude of fire arrival rates, and the
   efficacy of fuel reduction treatment. Our model incorporates planting
   density and the level and timing of fuel reduction treatment as
   landowner decisions. These factors affect, among other things, the loss
   a landowner incurs should fire arrive before harvesting. The value of
   information depends on the nature and combination of mistakes a
   landowner makes, the relationship between fire arrival and stand age,
   and on whether the landowner undertakes fuel treatment and values
   nontimber benefits. Information of various types is of most value to a
   landowner who does not undertake fuel treatment. The value of
   information about the magnitude of fire risk is also more than twice as
   high when the landowner underestimates fire risk, rather than
   overestimating it. For a landowner who undertakes fuel treatment but
   makes multiple mistakes, the asymmetry between overestimating and
   underestimating fire risk and efficacy of fuel reduction is even more
   pronounced.}},

   most of the constructive criticism of Japanese HE has not yet been

Abstract = {{Oral steroids can interrupt bouts of cluster headache (CH) attacks, but
   recurrence is frequent and may lead to steroid-dependency. Suboccipital
   steroid injection may be an effective `single shot' alternative, but no
   placebo-controlled trial is available. The aim of our study was to
   assess in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial the preventative
   effect on CH attacks of an ipsilateral steroid injection in the region
   of the greater occipital nerve. Sixteen episodic (ECH) and seven chronic
   (CCH) CH outpatients were included. ECH patients were in a new bout
   since no more than I week. After a one-week run-in period, patients were
   allocated by randomization to the placebo or verurn arms and received on
   the side of attacks a suboccipital injection of a mixture of long- and
   rapid-acting betamethasone (n=13; Verum-group) or physiological saline
   (n=10; Plac-group). Acute treatment was allowed at any time, additional
   preventative therapy if attacks persisted after I week. Three
   investigators performed the injections, while four others, blinded to
   group allocation, followed the patients. Follow-up visits were after I
   and 4 weeks, whereafter patients were followed routinely. Eleven
   Verum-group patients (3 CCH) (85\%) became attack-free in the first week
   after the injection compared to none in the Plac-group (P=0.0001). Among
   them eight remained attack-free for 4 weeks (P=0.0026). Remission lasted
   between 4 and 26 months in five patients. A single suboccipital steroid
   injection completely suppresses attacks in more than 80\% of CH
   patients. This effect is maintained for at least 4 weeks in the majority
   of them. (c) 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Abstract = {{Background Dermatological surgery is a relatively new and expanding
   subspecialty within dermatology. Little information is available about
   complications in this kind of surgery in the European setting.
   Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of
   anaesthetic, haemorrhagic and infectious complications in dermatological
   surgery and to highlight the factors associated with these
   complications.
   Methods Data were collected prospectively over a 3-month period for all
   surgical procedures performed by a network of dermatologists (n = 84
   dermatologists) in France, including the excision of all benign or
   malignant tumours but excluding sebaceous cysts and pyodermas.
   Information was collected regarding dermatologists, patients, procedures
   and complications.
   Results A total of 3788 surgical procedures were available for review;
   236 complications, mostly minor, occurred in a total of 213 surgical
   procedures (6\%), bleeding being the most common (3\%). Vaso-vagal
   syncope was the main anaesthetic complication (51 of 54). Infectious
   complications occurred in 79 patients (2\%). Superficial suppuration
   accounted for 92\% of surgical site infections. Only one patient had a
   systemic infection. Complications requiring additional antibiotic
   treatment or repeat surgery accounted for only 22 cases of 3788 (1\%).
   No statistically significant correlation was found with the
   characteristics of the dermatologists, especially with respect to their
   training or amount of surgical experience. Similarly, no link could be
   established between complications and surgical conditions. Multivariate
   analysis showed that anaesthetic or haemorrhagic complications were
   independent factors for infectious complications. Sex, administration of
   an anticoagulant or immunosuppressant, type of procedure performed and
   duration exceeding 24 min were independent factors for haemorrhagic
   complications.
   Conclusions This study shows a low rate of complications associated with
   dermatological surgery performed by dermatologists under local
   anaesthesia on an outpatient basis.}},

   period. Birthweight adjusted for gestational age was analysed in terms
   of grams and Z scores. There was an increase in birthweight of 100 g
   between 1989 and 1994 that coincided with the re-establishment of
   democracy and economic growth in Chile. The changes in birthweight were
   not explained by the available independent variables and trends of
   caesarean section, maternal obesity and post-mature deliveries over the
   period. The birthweight difference between mothers with university
   education and those with primary education was 0.2 Z scores (equivalent
   to 110 g) in 1985 and was greatly reduced by 2000 (equivalent to 40 g).
   A positive sense of social well-being and economic growth may have
   influenced an increase in birthweight between 1989 and 1994 as
   socio-economic growth preceded and continued after the period of
   increasing birthweight. Our study showed a remarkable decrease in the
   differences in birthweight by educational level not shown in other
   countries of similar wealth.}},

Abstract = {{We present an infant with macrocrania, who initially demonstrated
   prominent extra-axial fluid collections on sonography of the brain,
   compatible with benign infantile hydrocephalus (BIH). Because of
   increasing macrocrania, a follow-up sonogram of the brain was performed;
   it revealed progressive enlargement of the extra-axial spaces, which now
   had echogenic debris. Color Doppler US showed bridging veins traversing
   these extra-axial spaces, so it was initially thought that these spaces
   were subarachnoid in nature (positive cortical vein sign). However, an
   arachnoid membrane was identified superior to the cortex, and there was
   compression of true cortical vessels beneath this dural membrane. An MRI
   of the brain showed the extra-axial spaces to represent bilateral
   subdural hematomas. The pathogenesis of spontaneous development of the
   subdural hematomas, in the setting of BIH, is discussed. We also
   emphasize that visualizing traversing bridging veins through extra-axial
   spaces does not necessarily imply that these spaces are subarachnoid in
   origin.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of selected aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids on the
   development of off-flavours in water were studied. Combinations of
   hexanal, octanal, 2-octanone, 5-nonanone, hexanoic acid and nonanoic
   acid were rated by the off-flavour intensities they created in water at
   concentrations just at or below the threshold value of each analyte. Two
   different sensory panels evaluated the off-flavours induced by different
   combinations of the analytes. The observations of the two panels agreed
   well. From these studies, it could be concluded that aldehydes play an
   important role in the development of off-flavours intensities in water.
   There were synergistic effects between aldehydes and ketones, as well as
   between aldehydes and carboxylic acids. Small amounts of aldehydes and
   carboxylic acids - well below their respective threshold values - caused
   an increase in the off-flavour intensity. No synergism between ketones

Abstract = {{Different forms of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum expressed at

   groups with a total of 8 subtypes. Although mGluRs are also found at the
   climbing fiber (CF) to PC synapses, the distribution and biological
   activity of their types is not well-known. Using whole cell patch-clamp
   recordings from PCs in rat cerebellar slices with inhibitors of
   ionotropic receptors and glutamate uptake blockers we demonstrate a
   complex pharmacology of currents obtained by CF stimulation. The mGluR I
   specific antagonist CPCCOEt in a group of cells suppressed this
   response, but in a similar number of other cells it induced a
   potentiating effect. It was found that a switch between these two

   Results
   GFJ increased the mean AUC(0-24) of atorvastatin acid by 83\% (95\% CI

Abstract = {{The quality of squid deteriorates very rapidly after catch. To maintain
   the quality of squid for a longer period, we carried out super-chilling
   storage. Live swordtip squids Loligo edulis were killed and stored at -2

   time intervals, their external color, texture, and K-values were
   evaluated. Additionally, the levels of free amino acid, water-soluble
   and water-insoluble proteins, and viable cell counts were determined. In
   the samples stored using the super-chilling method, whitening of the
   exterior, elevation of K-values, and the increase of viable cell counts
   were suppressed. Regarding the meat structure, free amino acids,
   texture, and content of water-soluble and water-insoluble proteins, no
   differences were observed between the two different storage
   temperatures. These results suggest that super-chilling storage can
   prolong the period for which squid can be preserved and maintains a

Abstract = {{In a previous work {[}Macromolecules 2005, 38, 3783], nanocomposite
   materials obtained from a latex of natural rubber (NR) as matrix and an
   aqueous suspension of waxy maize starch nanocrystals as filler were
   processed and characterized in terms of morphology, structural, and
   barrier properties. The aim of the present work was to study the
   mechanical properties of these materials in both the linear and
   nonlinear range. It was shown that up to a content of 20 wt \% this new
   filler presents the advantage to reinforce NR without decreasing
   significantly the elongation at break of the material. The relaxed
   modulus at room temperature of nanocomposite films containing 20 wt \%
   of filler is 75 times higher than the one of the unfilled matrix.
   Particle-particle interactions play a crucial role in the properties of
   starch nanocrystals filled NR. The effect of moisture content and
   surface chemical modification of the starch nanocrystals on the
   reinforcing properties was also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper we show that inhomogeneity of a, continuous

   typically arises in the medium with a. linear mismatch of the natural
   frequency along a, spatial coordinate, whereas a, chaotic regime is not
   characteristic for the medium with randomly distributed frequencies. The
   interconnection has been revealed between the temporal chaotic behavior
   and the spatial formation of imperfect clusters. The spectral and
   correlation analysis as well as the linear analysis of stability of
   regular and chaotic regimes in the inhomogeneous medium are performed.
   The correlation of the instantaneous phase dynamics of oscillations with
   the behavior of autocorrelation functions has been examined. It has been
   established that the characteristics of temporal chaos correspond to a.
   spiral attractor (Shilnikov's attractor).}},

Abstract = {{Seed flax stalks are usually considered a waste product but they can be
   separated into marketable fiber and shive. The fiber can be used for
   applications such as composites and paper. Separation of traditional
   long line fiber from fiber flax stalks is a rigorous and expensive
   process that requires the stalk to be biologically degraded (retted)
   before processing. This process is not economically feasible for seed
   flax stalks. This study evaluated the potential of several machines
   traditionally used to remove foreign matter from cotton in terms of
   their capability to remove fax fiber from chopped seed flax straw. The
   successful mechanical principles of several machines were then
   incorporated into a single machine and used to separate the fiber and
   shive from the straw. The new machine consists of components of a
   modified gin cleaner typically used for cleaning seed cotton and
   components of a machine typically used for cleaning lint. The initial
   version of the machine did not yield the desired 80\% fiber purity so
   more saw cylinders were added. The most effective version produced
   13.8\% yield out of a possible 20\% fiber with a purity of 81.4\%. The
   yield can be improved with additional modifications to the machine.}},

Abstract = {{Background Stented segment length was a predictive factor for restenosis
   in the bare metal stent era. The objective of the study was to evaluate
   the medium-term clinical outcome and the potential for adverse effects
   when very long segments (ie, >= 64 mm of stented length) are treated by
   drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, an approach colloquially referred
   to as a ``full metal jacket.{''}
   Methods Since April 2002, we have used DES as the default stent for all
   percutaneous coronary interventions. From our prospective institutional
   database we identified 122 consecutive patients, with de novo coronary
   lesions, in whom a coronary artery was treated with at least 64 mm of
   overlapping DES: 81 patients were treated with sirolimus-eluting stents
   and 41 with paclitaxel-eluting stents.
   Results The mean number of stents per lesion was 3.3 +/- 1.1, and the
   median stented length was 79 mm (range 64-168 mm). Periprocedural Q-wave
   myocardial infarction (MI) occurred in 2 patients (1.6\%) and subacute
   stent thrombosis in 1 patient (0.8\%). During 1-year follow-up, 5
   patients (4.1\%), including 3 patients treated for acute MI with
   cardiogenic shock, died and 10 patients (8.2\%) had nonfatal MI
   (creatine kinase-MB >3 times). The 1-year target vessel
   revascularization rate was 7.5\% and the overall incidence of major
   adverse cardiac events was 18\%. Outcomes in sirolimus-eluting stents
   and paclitaxel-eluting stents groups did not differ statistically.
   Conclusions The use of DES for the treatment of diffuse lesions was
   associated with a low rate of repeat revascularization, irrespective of
   stent type. No safety concerns were raised at medium-term follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we demonstrated that plasma cortisol (Cor) levels were
   increased by road transportation in castrated male goats, but the extent
   of the increase was significantly reduced by 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone
   (DHT) implantation. This study aims to clarify whether the reduction of
   Cor secretion by androgen during transportation results from reduced
   plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Castrated goats were
   implanted separately with cholesterol (Cho), testosterone (T) or DHT,
   followed by transportation. Plasma Cor levels increased during
   transportation regardless of hormone treatment, but the levels in T and
   DHT treated animals were lower than those in animals treated with Cho.
   Plasma ACTH levels also increased during transportation, and those in T
   treated animals were significantly lower than in those treated with Cho.
   However, plasma ACTH levels in DHT treated animals varied among the
   animals and did not differ from those in Cho treated animals.
   Significant and highly positive correlations between the logarithm of
   plasma ACTH levels and plasma Cor levels were found in every treatment
   group. The areas under the regression curves between plasma ACTH levels
   and plasma Cor levels associated with T and DHT treatments were
   significantly lower than those with Cho treatment. In conclusion, T was
   shown to reduce ACTH secretion in response to transportation in
   castrated goats. However, this suppression of the increase in Cor
   secretion during transportation by androgen is suggested to be mainly a
   result of suppression of the responsiveness of the adrenal cortex to
   ACTH.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate photoluminescence behaviour of an ordered
   molecular porphyrin monolayer and its quenching properties by oxygen
   gas, a porphyrin with long alkyl chains,
   5,10,15,20-tetrakis{[}4-(11-carboxylundecane-1-oxy)phenyl]porphyrin (4),
   was synthesized and adsorbed onto an indium-tin oxide (ITO) substrate by
   a chemical dipping method. Cyclic voltammetry was used to analyze the
   ITO electrode coated with 4. The peak current of the first oxidation was
   proportional to the sweep rate, and the surface coverage was estimated
   to be 2.3-2.5 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2). The UV-vis spectrum of the monolayer
   showed a broadened Soret band, which shifted to longer wavelength. These
   features suggest that the porphyrin moieties of 4 are packed to form a
   J-type structure. The oxygen quenching ratio of the porphyrin 4
   monolayer on the ITO electrode, I-0/I-100, was estimated to be 1.25,
   where I-0 and I-100 are, respectively, luminescence intensity values in
   100\% argon and 100\% oxygen. On repeated step cycling between 100\%
   argon and 100\% oxygen atmospheres, the response times of luminescence
   quenching were 10s (argon to oxygen) and 23s (oxygen to argon). These
   findings suggest that a monolayer of sensing dye is applicable for
   oxygen sensing system without deterioration of size-accuracy of models.

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the diagnostic importance of serum-solubilized
   adhesion molecules, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular
   adhesion molecule-1, sE-selectin and sP-selectin in aortocoronary
   saphenous vein graft disease.
   Methods The study population was composed of two groups consisting of 41
   patients with saphenous vein graft stenosis (stenosis group) and 43
   patients without saphenous vein graft stenosis (no-stenosis group) based
   on the results of coronary angiography. All patients underwent coronary
   artery bypass graft operation involving the use of at least one
   saphenous vein graft for bypass. At the time of cardiac catheterization,
   it had been more than 1 year since the operation.
   Results Serum level of sP-selectin was significantly higher in the
   stenosis group than in the no-stenosis group (72.9 21.7 versus 48.7 18.6
   ng/ml, P < 0.001). No differences were found between the two groups with
   respect to serum levels of sE-selectin, intercellular adhesion
   molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Multivariate analysis
   revealed that only serum levels of sP-selectin, high-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were independently
   correlated with the stenosis of saphenous vein grafts. A cutoff value of
   serum sP-selectin > 575 ng/ml yields a specificity of 79.5\%, a
   sensitivity of 73.3\% and a positive predictive value of 80.5\% for
   saphenous vein graft stenosis.
   Conclusion In this study, sP-selectin level was found to be
   significantly higher in the group that had late aortocoronary saphenous
   vein bypass graft disease. This result suggests that platelet activation
   may play a causal role in late graft disease.}},

Title = {{Single-site mutations on the catalase-peroxidase from Sinorhizobium

Abstract = {{KatB is the only catalase-peroxidase identified so far in Sinorhizobium
   meliloti. It plays a housekeeping role, as it is expressed throughout
   all the growth phases of the free-living bacterium and also during
   symbiosis. This paper describes the functional and structural
   characterization of the KatB mutants Gly303Ser, Trp95Ala, Trp95Phe,
   Tyr217Leu, Tyr217Phe and Met243Val carried out by optical and electron
   spin resonance spectroscopy. The aim of this work was to investigate the
   involvement of these residues in the catalatic and/or peroxidatic
   reaction and falls in the frame of the open dispute around the factors
   that influence the balance between catalatic and peroxidatic activity in
   heme enzymes. The Gly303 residue is not conserved in any other protein
   of this family, whereas the Trp95, Tyr217 and Met243 residues are
   thought to form an intrinsic cofactor that is likely to play a role in
   intramolecular electron transfer. Spectroscopic investigations show that
   the Gly303Ser mutant is almost similar to the wild-type KatB and should
   not be involved in substrate binding. Mutations on Trp95, Tyr217 and
   Met243 clear out the catalatic activity completely, whereas the
   peroxidatic activity is maintained or even increased with respect to
   that of the wild-type enzyme. The k(cat) values obtained for these
   mutants suggest that Trp95 and Tyr217 form a huge delocalized system
   that provides a pathway for electron transfer to the heme. Conversely,
   Met243 is likely to be placed close to the binding site of the organic
   molecules and plays a crucial role in substrate docking.}},

Abstract = {{The contempory anti-sweatshop movement emerged more than 10 years ago.
   During that time period, numerous campaigns have challenged sweatshop
   labor practices (particularly in the garment industry) throughout the
   Americas. This article examines four such campaigns that primarily
   involved Central American garment workers and U.S.-based nongovernment
   organizations. The results of these case studies were relatively mixed.
   Gains (better wages and working conditions) were usually not broadened
   or sustained over time. What factors explain these disparate outcomes?
   Following and expanding on theoretical concepts and models embedded
   within the globalization and transnational social movement literatures,
   the author explores that question, describing each campaign's dynamics
   and comparatively analyzing all four The author concludes with some
   short-term, medium-term, and long-term proposals for addressing the
   various obstacles that the anti-sweatshop movement currently faces.}},

   Kish Island, south of Iran. In addition, tree shape, number of leaves
   and leaves mineral nutrient content of allogame palms and their
   correlations with flowering and fruiting habit of the trees were
   recorded. Results showed that 84.44\% of experimental trees needs cross
   pollination. Effective pollination period of female flowers was about
   24-48 hr after receptivity of female flowers may be considered for good
   pollination, fertilization and further enough fruit set. Other
   pollination types recorded were direct-self pollination (6.67\%) and
   indirect-self pollination (8.89\%). Crown-shape evaluation revealed that
   most of the palms have vertical (X-shape) or semi-spherical crown-shape
   that produce less fruit than spherical canopy type. There was a linear
   correlation (R-2 = 0.81) between leaf and spadix number, however palms

   and mystical traditions aimed to isolate concepts of mind and body. A
   more direct challenge of the spatial unity comes from a well-defined

   subject has the impression of seeing a second own body in an
   extrapersonal space. AP are known to occur in many human cultures and
   have been described in healthy, as well as neurological and psychiatric
   populations. In this article we investigate the phenomenology of AP as
   described in the writings of the ecstatic Kabbalah of the thirteenth
   century, and search for similarities and differences with respect to AP
   from these and other populations. The article discusses potential common

Abstract = {{Clinical impact of high-grade (HG) cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia
   after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has not been clarified.
   Therefore, in order to investigate the risk factors and outcome for
   HG-CMV antigenemia, we retrospectively analyzed the records of 154
   Japanese adult patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
   transplantation for the first time from 1995 to 2002 at the University
   of Tokyo Hospital. Among 107 patients who developed positive CMV
   antigenemia at any level, 74 received risk-adapted preemptive therapy
   with ganciclovir (GCV), and 17 of these developed HG-antigenemia defined
   as >= 50 positive cells per two slides. The use of systemic
   corticosteroids at >= 0.5 mg/kg/day at the initiation of GCV was
   identified as an independent significant risk factor for HG-antigenemia.
   Seven of the 17 HG-antigenemia patients developed CMV disease, with a
   cumulative incidence of 49.5\%, which was significantly higher than that
   in the low-grade antigenemia patients (4\%, P < 0.001). However, overall
   survival was almost equivalent in the two groups. In conclusion, the
   development of HG-antigenemia appeared to depend on the profound immune
   suppression of the recipient. Although CMV disease frequently developed
   in HG- antigenemia patients, antiviral therapy could prevent a fatal
   outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A hypercoagulable stress response might contribute to the
   increased cardiovascular risk in Alzheimer's caregivers. Objectives: (1)
   To evaluate whether coping processes affect hemostatic reactivity to
   acute psychological stress and (2) whether these effects differ
   substantially between caregivers and noncaregivers. Methods: Sixty
   elderly community-dwelling spousal caregivers of patients with
   Alzheimer's disease and 33 noncaregiving controls completed the revised
   Ways of Coping Questionnaire to assess approach/problem-solving versus
   avoidant coping processes. Participants were administered an acute
   stress test that required them to deliver a 3-minute speech challenge to
   the inter-viewer on an assigned topic. The hypercoagulability marker
   D-dimer was measured at three time points: baseline, immediately
   postspeech, and during recovery (15 minutes postspeech). Results:
   Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed that subjects who endorsed
   greater levels of approach coping had decreased levels of D-dimer at all
   time points (p = .048). A significant three-way interaction between
   planful problem solving, caregiver status, and the temporal pattern of
   D-dimer was found (p = .004), indicating that caregivers with low levels
   of planful problem solving exhibited greater increases in D-dimer from
   baseline to speech and recovery time points relative to controls. No
   relationship between avoidant coping and D-dimer was found. Conclusions:
   These findings suggest the possibility that approach and problem-solving
   coping processes buffer the impact of acute psychological stressors on
   procoagulant activity. It remains to be seen whether interventions that
   increase approach/problem-solving processes might produce salutary
   effects among caregiving populations.}},

Abstract = {{Cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis, ROS generation and inhibition of
   cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression by curcumin {[}1] and
   alpha-diisoeugenol {[}2] were investigated. The cytotoxicity of curcumin
   and alpha-diisoeugenol against human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60
   cells) and human submandibular cancer cells (HSG cells) was similar
   (CC50 1-3 mu M). However, curcumin induced much more apoptosis,
   particularly in HL-60 cells compared with HSG cells, as revealed by
   measurement of the sub-G(1)/G(0) DNA fraction in flow cytometric
   histograms. Treatment with 15 mu M curcumin increased the number of
   cells with a sub-G(1)/G(0) DNA fraction from control levels of <5\% to
   55\% in HL-60 cells and 30\% in HSG cells. Flow cytometry, after
   staining with annexin V-FITC/PI (the exposure of phosphatidylserme (PS)
   on the surface of apoptotic cells), showed a dose-dependent induction of
   early apoptosis by curcumin, which reached about 65\% in HL-60 cells and
   about 20\% in HSG cells after treatment with 10,mu M curcumin. In
   contrast, alpha-diisoeugenol failed to induce apoptosis in either cell
   type. For both cell types, the proportion of late apoptotic/necrotic
   cells increased rapidly at concentrations of curcumin and
   alpha-diisoeugenol greater than 10 mu M. The generation of intracellular
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) in curcumin-treated HL-60 cells was
   greater than that in HSG cells, as judged by CDFH-DA staining. In both
   cell types, ROS generation by alpha-diisoeugenol was at control levels.
   ROS generation by curcumin was suppressed by antioxidants such as
   N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NA C) and glutathione (GSH) and by scavengers of
   hydroxy radicals such as mannitol, but, conversely, was promoted by
   prooxidants such as the transition metal ions Cu(II) and Zn(II). ROS
   generation may play a part in the exposure of PS. Curcumin, but not
   alpha-diisoeugenol, at 10 mu M inhibited LPS
   (lipopolysaccharide)-induced COX-2 gene expression in RAW 264.7 cells.
   Semiempirical PM 3 calculations suggested that this activity of
   curcumin, in which it behaves as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
   (NSAID)-like compound, is dependent on its phenolic function, which is
   more pronounced than that of alpha-diisoeugenoL Taken together, our
   results suggest that the bioactivity of curcumin is a result of its
   ability to act as both a prooxidant and an antioxidant.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Chronic pelvic pain is associated with a wide range of
   clinical conditions that include endometriosis. The precise cause,
   mechanisms of pain, and natural history are imprecise. Patterns of
   uterine innervation have been Studied after hysterectomy for chronic
   pelvic pain with and without endometriosis.
   Study design: Tissue blocks were taken from the lower one half of the
   uterus after hysterectomy for advanced endometriosis (n = 16 specimens;
   group 1) and for chronic pelvic pain without endometriosis (n = 15
   specimens; group 2). The control group consisted of uteri that were
   removed For painless gynecologic conditions (n = 25 specimens; group 3).
   Tissue sections from the lower one half of the uterus were stained with
   anti-S100 to demonstrate patterns of innervation, and nerve Fiber
   profiles were Counted by standardized techniques; qualitative
   differences were also recorded.
   Results: In uteri from women with advanced endometriosis, there were
   increased numbers of nerve fiber profiles compared with control
   specimens (group I vs group 3; P = .0013, Mann Whitney U test). There
   were also increased numbers of nerve fiber profiles in uteri that were
   associated with chronic pelvic pain without endometriosis (group 2 vs
   group 3; P = .04, Mann Whitney U test). There were no differences in
   nerve fiber Count in uteri from groups 1 and 2 (P = .35, Mann Whitney U
   test). Comparing both groups of uteri with controls (groups I and 2 vs
   3) demonstrated marked differences in nerve fiber Counts (P = .002, Mann
   Whitney U test). Two distinctive patterns of reinnervation that were
   observed: disruption of nerve bundles (collateral sprouting with
   microneuroma formation) and ingrowth around blood vessels (perivascular
   nerve fiber proliferation). There were increased numbers of
   microneuromas (groups 1 and 2 vs 3; P = .001, chi-squared test with
   Yates correction) and perivascular nerve Fiber proliferation (groups 1
   and 2 vs 3; P = .008, chi-squared test with Yates correction) in the
   myometrium in chronic pelvic pain with, and without, endometriosis
   compared with the control group.
   Conclusion: Nerve Fiber proliferation and other features of
   reinnervation have been observed in the isthmic regions of uteri that
   were removed at hysterectomy for chronic pelvic pain with and without
   endometriosis. There were no quantitative differences between the groups
   with chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis. These observations provide
   an alternative explanation for the Source of pain and other clinical
   symptoms in these clinical settings. (C) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The value of imaging in patients with suspicion of bowel obstruction is
   dependent on the ability to answer questions relevant to the clinical
   management of patients. Is there mechanical obstruction? Is it a small
   bowel obstruction (SBO) or a large bowel obstruction (LBO)? What is the
   transition point? What is the cause of the obstruction? What is the
   severity of the obstruction? The results of studies published more than
   10 years ago using axial and single-slice helical CT gave rise to
   findings based on axial slices that enables CT to answer these different
   questions. With the recent advent of multislice CT, large numbers of
   thin sections can be generated with short image intervals, which is well
   suited to postprocessing. Postprocessing techniques include standard
   reformatting methods such as sagittal, coronal and oblique reformatting,
   curved reformatting, maximum and minimum-intensity projection, variable
   thickness viewing, and volume and surface rendering. This pictorial
   review illustrates the added value of postprocessing for answering
   different questions concerning patients with suspicion of bowel
   obstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Animal models of thermal injury indicate reactive oxygen species and
   inflammatory cytokines as causative agents in tissue injury on various
   organs distant from the original wound. Trapidil has various properties,
   such as inhibition of platelet aggregation and lipid peroxidation as
   well as reduction of the inflammatory response to injury. This study was
   designed to determine the possible protective effect of trapidil
   treatment against oxidative organ damage in lung, intestine and kidney
   induced by cutaneous thermal injury.
   Thirty Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups. Sham group (n
   = 6) was exposed to 21 degrees C water while burn-3 h group (n = 6) and
   burn + trap-3 h group (n = 6), burn-24 It (it = 6) and burn + trap-24 It
   groups were exposed to boiling water for 12 s to produce a full
   thickness burn in 35-40\% of total body surface area. In both burn +
   trap-3 h and burn-trap-24 h group, 8 mg/kg trapidil was given
   intravenously immediately after thermal injury. Three and 24 It later,
   tissue samples were taken for biochemical analysis from lung, intestine
   and kidney and blood samples were obtained to determinate serum
   TNF-alpha levels. Cutaneous thermal injury caused a significant increase
   in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) and
   3-nitrotyrozine (3-NT) levels in all tissues and elevated serum
   TNF-alpha levels at post-burn 3 and 24 h. Trapidil treatment
   significantly reduced in biochemical parameters, as well as serum
   TNF-alpha levels. These data suggest that trapidil has a protective
   effect against oxidative organ damage in burn injury. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   Materials and methods: Three children aged 10, 20 and 21 months were
   examined. Results: On T2-weighted MR images there were hyperintense
   signal changes in the basal ganglia and cerebral white matter. MR
   spectroscopy demonstrated an increase in myoinositol/creatine and
   choline/creatine ratios with a decrease in the N-acetyl

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of decomposing an integer matrix
   into a weighted sum of binary matrices that have the strict consecutive
   ones property. This problem is motivated by an application in cancer
   radiotherapy planning, namely the sequencing of multileaf collimators to
   realize a given intensity matrix. In addition, we also mention another
   application in the design of public transportation. We are interested in
   two versions of the problem, minimizing the sum of the coefficients in
   the decomposition (decomposition time) and minimizing the number of
   matrices used in the decomposition (decomposition cardinality). We
   present polynomial time algorithms for unconstrained and constrained
   versions of the decomposition time problem and prove that the
   (unconstrained) decomposition cardinality problem is strongly NP-hard.
   For the decomposition cardinality problem, some polynomially solvable
   special cases are considered and heuristics are proposed for the general
   case. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the known adverse effects of caffeine in the widely consumed
   beverages like coffee and tea, a caffeine free product is desirable. The
   commonly used solvents in decaffeination suffer from the disadvantage of
   being carcinogenic or increase the process costs tremendously. A
   biotechnological approach for decaffeination involving microbial cells
   or enzymes is viewed as a potential alternative approach.
   Present studies on the degradation of caffeine were carried out using a
   strain of Pseudomonas alcaligenes CFR 1708, isolated from coffee
   plantation soil. The enzymes responsible for caffeine degradation were
   found to be inducible. Pre-induction of the microbial cells in a medium
   containing caffeine as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen was
   carried out for 48 h. The induced bacterial cells were found to be
   capable of completely degrading caffeine (1 g/l) from solutions
   containing caffeine, within 4 to 6 h at 30 +/- 2 degrees C in the pH
   range of 7.0-8.0. To make the process of decaffeination application
   oriented immobilisation of cell debris were done and used in designed
   bioreactor for continuous decaffeination process. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Pages = {{195-203}},

Abstract = {{Multipoint linkage methods are powerful tools that are often employed as
   the first means to discover alleles affecting liability to diseases.
   With the advent of dense marker maps, linkage disequilibrium (LD)
   between markers is inevitable and it comes at the cost of bias and an
   increased rate of false-positive findings for linkage analyses that
   assume alleles of different markers are independent. I propose a
   ``multipoint on subsets{''} method that avoids this issue by
   partitioning the markers into interlaced and non-overlapping subsets.
   Each subset is analyzed separately, their statistics are then averaged,
   and the resulting average is standardized by its estimated standard
   deviation. In addition to being robust to the challenges induced by
   dependent marker alleles, data simulated under linkage equilibrium show
   that the proposed method does not suffer any detectable loss of power
   when compared to traditional methods.}},

Abstract = {{The sharpshooter Homalodisca coagulata (Say) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae:
   Cicadellinae) is an exotic vector of the Pierce's disease (PD)
   bacterium, Xylella fastidiosa (Wells et al.), that was first observed in
   California in 1989. H. coagulata has since greatly increased the threat
   of PD to the grape industry as well as stone fruit, nursery, and
   ornamental industries in California. This is the first in a series of
   articles that together describe how sharpshooter stylet penetration
   behaviors (especially intricate stylet activities, salivation, and
   ingestion) control transmission (i.e., acquisition and inoculation) of
   X. fastidiosa. Herein, we categorized and characterized alternating
   current electrical penetration graph (EPG) waveforms from glass-winged
   sharpshooter stylet penetration on petiole of susceptible grape
   ('Cabernet Sauvignon'), paying special attention to waveform fine
   structures that are likely to be the key to detecting the instant of
   inoculation. We also correlated waveforms with salivary sheath termini
   in grape tissues. For the first time in any EPG study of leafhopper or
   planthopper feeding, we demonstrate through case studies of individual
   probes how to follow the process of stylet penetration step by step as
   it is occurring, including salivary sheath branching and when the
   stylets first puncture a xylem cell. Finally, we discuss the
   implications of our findings for understanding the transmission
   mechanism of X. fastidiosa, in comparison with hypothesized mechanisms

Abstract = {{Surface water samples were collected from 55 sites in the Great Lakes
   Basin and analyzed for the presence of perchlorate using HPLC/MS/MS with

   impacted by heavy industry, urbanization, agriculture and atmospheric
   deposition. Perchlorate was detected at several of the sites at
   concentrations close to the method detection limit (0.2 mu g/l). Despite
   these low concentrations, its presence was confirmed by sample
   concentration and determination of the isotopic ratio of perchlorate.
   The presence of perchlorate at two of the sites was related to a
   fireworks display which had occurred prior to sampling. The other
   detections of perchlorate were in rivers/creeks draining watersheds
   which had high density livestock and crop farming activity. We suspect
   the two are related. To our knowledge, these are the first reported

Abstract = {{The possibility of determining the location of an acoustic source in the

   parameters in the search space and tweaking them, but usually not
   deter-mining their true values. This is possible due to a parameter
   hierarchy in which the source position is more important than the
   environmental parameters. The parameter hierarchy is shown to also apply
   to uncertainties associated with internal waves. Due to differences in
   the nature of the parameter space, this problem is solved with a

Title = {{Serum lipids and outcome of early-stage breast cancer: Results of a

Abstract = {{Purpose. The prognosis of women with early-stage breast cancer is
   influenced by insulin and body mass index (BMI). High levels of serum
   insulin and obesity often coexist with dyslipidemia in the insulin
   resistance syndrome (IRS), but the contribution of lipids to breast
   cancer outcome is unclear. Here, we examine whether serum levels of
   total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) influence breast cancer
   outcome.
   Patients and methods. A cohort of 520 women without known hyperlipidemia
   or diabetes, with stage T1-T3, N0-N1, M0 breast cancer, was assembled
   from July 1989 to June 1996. Fasting blood was collected at baseline.
   Subjects were followed prospectively, for recurrence (local, regional,
   distant) and death. Cox models were used to calculate the prognostic
   effect of TC and TG levels. Two-sided significance levels were set at
   0.025.
   Results. TC was correlated with age (Spearman's r = 0.44) and low tumor
   grade (p = 0.01), while TG was correlated with insulin (r = 0.43) and
   BMI (r = 0.45). At a median follow-up of 8.7 years, TC and TG were not
   associated with breast cancer recurrence or death before of after
   adjustment for age, tumor-related variables, BMI or fasting insulin
   levels. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, tumor-related
   variables and BMI, a trend towards an adverse effect of TC on disease
   recurrence was seen (HR recurrence = 1.62 for the 4th versus. 1st
   quartile, 2-sided p = 0.03).
   Conclusions. Fasting TG was not associated with outcome. A trend towards
   risk of recurrence was seen with higher TC in multivariate analysis.
   This potential association should be explored in future studies.}},

Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an approach for 3-D travel-time tomography,
   which works well in reconstructing high contrast velocity anomalies in
   both location and strength. It uses a revised `irregular' approach to
   the shortest-path method as the ray tracer and a damped minimum norm,
   and constrained least-squares CG approach as the inversion solver. In
   ray tracing, the advantages of the revised `irregular' over the
   `irregular' approach are that the secondary nodes introduced on the cell
   surfaces significantly improve accuracy of computed travel times,
   without dramatically increasing the total number of cells and nodes; the
   tri-linear velocity function defined across the cell guarantees accurate
   ray tracing in a high velocity contrast medium; and the capacity to
   calculate a relatively large 3-D model, due to the fast run speed (at
   least one order of magnitude over the `regular' approach) and less
   number of total nodes. The introduction of `soft' and `hard' bounds into
   the inversion process changes the conditioning and makes the solution
   meaningful in a physical sense. Thus the artifacts caused by noise and
   high velocity contrasts are substantially suppressed and the image
   quality is considerably improved, making the solution realistic with
   noisy or inconsistent travel-time data. Several numerical tests indicate
   that we can obtain good quality images even for high velocity contrast
   anomalies (say more than 20\%) in the target region. This means the
   inversion algorithm is an efficient and effective procedure. Meanwhile,
   the inversion procedure is not very sensitive to the quality of the
   travel-time data, which is promising for practical usage.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background. Malignant neoplasmas of the paranasal sinuses are rare and
   present usually in advanced tumor stage due to the lack of early
   clinical symptoms.
   Patients and Methods. In the last 10 years, 63 patients with paranasal
   malignancies were treated at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and
   Neck Surgery of the University of Wurzburg. 33\% of the patients showed
   an occupational exposition (wood-processing or metal industry). At the
   time of the first visit to our institution 95\% of the patients
   presented with an extensive disease, staged T3 and T4. Adenocarcinoma
   (24\%), squamous cell carcinoma (22\%) and malignant melanoma (19\%)
   were the most common histologies. Surgery combined with radiotherapy was
   the treatment strategy in 55 patients (87\%).
   Results. Patients with a complete surgical resection showed a higher
   5-year-survival rate (77\%) than patients with an incomplete resection
   (56\%). In 38\% (n=21) of the patients treated with surgery and
   radio,therapy, a local recurrence of the tumor was observed. This
   recurrence localised in the skull base and/or the orbita/periorbita
   occurred most frequently in the first (46\%) or the second year (31\%).
   Conclusion. The prognosis of malignant paranasal tumors depends mainly
   on the control of the local tumor growth. Modern strategies of surgical
   treatment in combination with radiotherapy need to be implemented in an
   effort to achieve a continuous remission.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Canadian Neurological Society commissioned a manpower
   survey in 2002 to assess demographics, distribution, specialty
   interests, working conditions, job satisfaction and future plans of
   neurologists across the country. Methods: A survey was mailed to all
   known Canadian neurologists (n = 694) on two separate occasions. Further
   encouragement by telephone contact was undertaken. The response rate was
   54\%. Results: The mean age of neurologists who responded was 51 years,
   with 14\% being women. Approximately 55\% of neurologists were
   community-based. Seventy-six percent designated a sub-specialty
   interest. On average, neurologists worked 57 hours per week and the
   majority had significant ``on-call{''} commitments. Job satisfaction was
   higher among academic neurologists when compared with community-based
   neurologists, and greater among men than women. A greater percentage of
   older neurologists were satisfied with their work than their younger
   colleagues. Significant attrition in the neurological work force is a
   major concern, since up to 20\% of neurologists reported that they are
   likely to retire in the next five years and about 15\% are likely to
   reduce their practice. Conclusions: This survey suggests that
   substantial concerns are facing Canadian neurology over the next five
   years. Major efforts to retain existing expertise and enhance residency
   training will be required to simply maintain the present quality of
   neurological care in Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Fumonisins are the major mycotoxins produced by Fusarium verticilloides
   and F proliferatum fungi which are widely found as contaminants in corn
   and corn screenings. These molecules are hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic for
   several species and carcinogenic in rodents. Moreover their consumption
   was linked to high prevalence of human oesophageal cancer in certain
   geographic areas. The aim of this work was to improve FBI production and
   purification procedures in laboratory conditions in order to produce
   large quantities of semi-purified toxin that may be used in experimental
   intoxications of farm animals. We used a highly toxigenic strain of
   Fusarium verticilloides (NRRL-3428) isolated from feeds. Influence of
   substrate, temperature, water content. culture recipient size and screen
   analysis of the substrate on fumonisin production was tested. Optimal
   production was obtained when strain was grown on coarsely cracked corn
   with 50\% water content at 21 degrees C during 5 weeks. This allowed the
   production of 3 to 4 g of fumonisin B I per kg Of Culture material. The
   composition of the extracts was found to be as follow : 54\% FB1. 8\%
   FB2, 9\% FB3 and 29\% of pigments coming from corn. The ratio observed
   between FBI and FB2 is comparable to the one reported in naturally
   contaminated corn. Further purification of these extracts on SAX columns
   led to the removal of pigments and to obtain of fumonisins extracts pure
   enough to be used for intra-venous or intra-peritoneal injection.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the prevalence and correlates of hepatitis C virus
   infection in a sample of detained adolescents.
   Design/Setting/Participants: Cross-sectional prevalence study with 10-
   to 18-year-old adolescents who were consecutively admitted to a juvenile
   detention center in San Antonio, Tex.
   Main Outcome Measures: The prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection and
   associated risk factors.
   Results: Of the 1002 participants, 75\% were Hispanic and the mean age
   was 15 years. Twenty adolescents had laboratory data consistent with
   hepatitis C virus infection, giving an overall prevalence of 2.0\% (95\%
   confidence interval, 1.2-3.1). All adolescents infected with hepatitis C
   virus were Hispanic (13 boys and 7 girls). Although a high proportion of
   the participants reported having had intranasal drug use (55.6\%),
   tattooing (50.5\%), or body piercing (25.3\%), the only factor
   significantly associated with hepatitis C virus infection was having a
   history of injection drug use. Injection drug use was reported by 5.3\%
   of the participants but by 95\% (19/20) of those infected with the
   hepatitis C virus.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that injection drug use was linked
   with the majority of hepatitis C virus infections in this population of
   detained adolescents, similar to findings in adults. These adolescents
   reported a high frequency of other behaviors that could potentially pose
   a risk for contracting bloodborne infections. Effective prevention and

Abstract = {{Objectives. The use of drugs in an off label or unlicensed manner to
   treat children is a widespread phenomenon in Europe and the United
   States. The incidence of unlicensed and off label prescribing in
   paediatric cardiology practice has not been studied to date. This study
   was designed to assess the extent and nature of off label and unlicensed
   drug use in paediatric cardiology inpatients. Methods. In a prospective
   study, drug prescriptions in a paediatric cardiology ward were reviewed
   during a 2-year period. Data were collected and analyzed by special
   software created for this purpose. Results. The children (n=544) studied
   varied in age from 4 h to 18 years. One or more off label and unlicensed
   prescriptions were given to 414 (76\%) patients. Of the 2,130
   prescriptions given during the 2-year period, more than one-half were
   unlicensed (11\%) or off label (47\%). While children aged 2-11 years
   received most of the unlicensed drug prescriptions (17\%), neonates, who
   did not receive unlicensed drugs, led (64\%) in the use of off label
   drugs. Conclusions. This study showed that the problem of off label and
   unlicensed drug use also exists in paediatric cardiology. The findings
   imply that the phenomenon of off label and unlicensed use of drugs in
   children can be correlated with the deficiency of paediatric drug
   formulations on the global market and insufficient data from clinical
   studies which must be performed to confirm the efficacy and safety of
   drugs in the paediatric population. Therefore, efforts to improve
   paediatric labelling are important and need the full support of all
   involved.}},

Abstract = {{The isolation process exposes human pancreatic islets to exogenous
   isolation enzymes. Exposure to these enzymes, as a result of intraductal
   injection in the pancreas or simple contact of islets with enzyme
   components, causes internalization into the islet cells of enzymes and
   their by-products. Human islets exposed to Liberase-HI exhibit a
   decreased insulin secretory ability that correlates with the time of
   exposure. This phenomenon is paralleled by increased expression of
   adhesion molecules (CD106 and CD62p) and activation of apoptotic
   pathways (Bax and Bcl-2) in islet cells. Increased functional impairment
   is also observed after islet transplantation in diabetic immunodeficient
   mice. Experimental exposure of islet grafts to exogenous isolation
   enzymes causes intense inflammation (CD11b positive cells) at the
   transplant site and it was associated with sickness behavior and
   eventually death of mouse recipients. The extent of these adverse
   effects likely deceives the standard qualitative protocols currently in
   use to assess islet quality in vitro. Reducing the secondary effects of
   exogenous isolation enzymes on isolated human islets may be crucial to
   enhance the quality of islets as tissue grafts.}},

Title = {{Beveled Needle Technique Is Not Associated with Low ``Take{''} Rates in
   Israeli Smallpox Revaccination Campaign}},
Journal = {{HUMAN VACCINES}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{224-227}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: In its first large-scale smallpox vaccination campaign in
   the 20(th) century, Israel has experienced an exceptionally high rate of
   failure to achieve clinical take following vaccination. It was
   hypothesized that this failure rates might be attributed to the unique
   vaccination technique adopted in Israel, of using beveled needles rather
   than bifurcated needles.
   Materials and methods: We retrospectively identified two cohorts
   vaccinated in the defined dates during the Israeli revaccination
   campaign, in which beveled needles and bifurcated needles were used
   alternately, and studied the impact of different covariates on clinical
   vaccination outcome measures.
   Results: Of 116 subjects that were vaccinated within the defined dates,
   46 were vaccinated using bifurcated needles, and 70 by beveled needles.
   `Take' rates in subjects vaccinated up to 20 years earlier was 77.5\%,
   compared with 97.2\% among those vaccinated in the more distant past (p
   = 0.001). In multivariate analyses, vaccination `take' was independently
   associated with a shorter time from previous vaccination (p = 0.013),
   but not with gender, birth country, vaccinator or the vaccination
   technique used.
   Conclusions: The low take rates observed in the Israeli smallpox
   revaccination campaign could not be attributed to the unique local
   vaccination technique, and was most likely induced by a higher rate of
   residual immunity among vaccinees, compared with the US, as well as by
   the lower vaccine concentrations used in Israel. In countries and
   circumstances when bifurcated needles are not sufficiently available,
   the beveled needle technique may be considered an appropriate
   alternative.}},

   Seventy-nine patients with asymptomatic severe carotid lesion were
   randomly assigned to group I (n = 40) or group II (n = 39) to receive
   prophylactic CEA (within 1 week before major surgery) or deferred CEA
   (between 30 days and 6 months after major surgery), respectively. All
   procedures were eversion CEAs performed under deep general anesthesia
   and cerebral protection involving continuous electroencephalographic
   monitoring for selective shunting. There were no perioperative deaths or
   strokes relating to the major surgical procedure in either group. All
   group II patients underwent deferred CEA as planned (median 47 days,
   range 38-94) with no subsequent perioperative deaths or strokes. Two of
   these patients (5.1\%) suffered a minor stroke, however, 65 and 78 days

Abstract = {{Computer Aided Design systems provide tools for building and
   manipulating models of solid objects. Some also provide access to
   programming languages so that parametrised designs can be expressed.
   There is a sharp distinction, therefore, between building models, a
   concrete graphical editing activity, and programming, an abstract,
   textual, algorithm-construction activity. The recently proposed Language
   for Structured Design (LSD) was motivated by a desire to combine the
   design and programming activities in one language. LSD achieves this by
   extending a visual logic programming language to incorporate the notions
   of solids and operations on solids. Here we investigate another aspect
   of the LSD approach, namely, that by using visual logic programming as
   the engine to drive the parametrised assembly of objects, we also gain
   the powerful symbolic problem-solving capability that is the forte of
   logic programming languages. This allows the designer/ programmer to
   work at a higher level, giving declarative specifications of a design in
   order to obtain the design descriptions. Hence LSD integrates problem
   solving, design synthesis, and prototype assembly in a single
   homogeneous programming/design environment. We demonstrate this
   specification-to-final-assembly capability using the masterkeying
   problem for designing systems of locks and keys.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive set of control schemes can be presently implemented on
   RFX due to the enhanced load assembly and renewed power supply system.
   The schemes include: plasma equilibrium control and resistive wall mode
   stabilization, aiming at controlling actively the discharge when the
   passive action of the shell vanishes; the rotation of the localised
   helical deformation to minimize the enhanced plasma-wall interaction;
   the MHD mode control and the `intelligent shell', aiming at achieving a
   better comprehension of the underlying physics.
   To the purpose, an integrated, distributed, digital system has been
   developed consisting of a set of computing nodes. Each node can act
   either as pre-processing or control station, the former acquiring raw
   data and computing intermediate control parameters, the latter executing
   control algorithms and driving the power amplifiers. An overview of the
   system architecture is presented in the paper with reference to the
   software real-time environment providing both basic functions, such as
   data read-out and real-time communication, and useful tools to program
   control algorithms, to perform simulations and to commission the system.
   To simulate the control schemes, the real-time environment is extended
   to include a so called `simulation mode', in which the real-time nodes
   exchange their input/output signals with one station running a suitable
   model of the experiment, for instance the two dimensional FEM code
   MAXFEA in the case of the equilibrium control. In this way the control
   system can be tested offline and the time needed for the commissioning
   of algorithms reduced. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Due to increasing costs and inconveniences in replacing deteriorated
   sewer pipelines by conventional excavation methods, the trenchless or
   ``no-dig{''} technology is being used extensively. In this manuscript, a
   testing method is proposed to determine the long-term creep behavior of
   encased polymer and felt-reinforced polymer liners used in sewer
   rehabilitation. Long-term tests are conducted on liner samples encased
   in steel pipes, installed by the industries participating in the
   research project. The thicknesses of the polymer liners are selected
   according to the typical use of each product in the field. Three samples
   each of five liner materials are tested under constant external
   hydrostatic pressure to find their long-term structural properties. A
   pressure regulator, pressure transducer, and several pressure gages at
   different points in the water line are used to maintain constant
   hydraulic pressure in the gap between the steel host and the polymer
   liner. A method is proposed for sealing the ends of the encased liner
   samples for testing. The long-term creep data are collected with strain
   gages bonded along the inner circumference of the liner and connected to
   a data acquisition system (DAS). A data reduction method is proposed to
   separate the membrane and bending strains in order to compute the creep
   compliance. The temperature of the liners is monitored continuously with
   the use of a thermocouple. The strain data collected from the DAS are
   compensated for differences in temperature throughout the period of
   testing, initial deformation, and coefficient of thermal expansion.
   Several viscoelastic models are investigated in order to fit the data.
   The data are used to predict the long-term modulus used in the design of
   trenchless rehabilitation projects.}},

Abstract = {{Antituberculous treatment is a well-known cause of fulminant hepatic
   failure (FHF). This could lead to liver transplantation as the only
   possible treatment, which on the other hand could be contraindicated due
   to active tuberculosis. The risk of aggressive dissemination of the
   disease after transplantation is not clearly determined by the current
   second-line antituberculous therapies. We report a case of vertebral
   tuberculosis treated with rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide. He
   developed an FHF that was treated with urgent liver transplantation.
   Despite the immunosuppression, the disease was well controlled with
   ciprofloxacin, ethambutol and streptomycin and the patient is in good
   health 23 months after transplantation. In conclusion, active
   extrapulmonary tuberculosis should perhaps be considered for liver
   transplantation when FHF develops due to anti-tuberculous drugs.}},

   Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival plots and Cox

   the population attributes from each center or between treatment groups.
   The median survival time for animals treated with trilostane was 662

   There were no significant differences between the survival times for

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to explore the impact of quantifiers on

   express bleak expectations and their global nature suggests no

   all of it will be bleak''). We hypothesised that less extreme
   quantifiers would access alternative future perspectives. Depressed
   participants with high levels of hopelessness generated continuations to
   sentence stems that quantified different amounts of future time.
   Averaging over conditions, the depressed were more negative than
   never-depressed controls, but differences were attenuated in response to
   the quantifier some-the depressed were more positive and less negative
   under this condition (e.g., `'Some of the future...will be good''). By
   differentiating subsets of the future, some produced contrasts with

   NSAID-induced intestinal damage. The levels of sugars such as sialic
   acid, fucose, hexose and hexosamine were increased in SLP and decreased
   in the BBM following indomethacin treatment, with the effects being
   maximal 24 h after the administration of the drug. The composition of
   lipids in the SLP was also found to be altered. There was a significant
   increase in the number of bacteria in the luminal contents of the small
   intestine and caecum in these animals, as compared with controls. The
   number of bacteria adherent to the intestinal mucosa was also
   significantly higher in the drug-treated group. In vitro studies
   revealed that there was an increased tendency for bacteria to adhere to
   SLP isolated from indomethacin-treated rats. These results suggest that
   alterations in glycosylation of SLP and BBM in response to indomethacin,
   along with qualitative and quantitative changes in the luminal bacterial
   flora, may facilitate translocation of bacteria into the mucosa. These
   changes may contribute to the enteropathy observed as a result of NSAID
   treatment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Fusobacterium necrophorum as the cause of recurrent sore throat:
   comparison of isolates from persistent sore throat syndrome and
   Lemierre's disease}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFECTION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{51}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Fusobacterium necrophorum is a well established cause of
   Lemierre's disease (LD); a syndrome characterised by severe sore throat,
   septicaemia, multiple abscesses and jugular vein thrombosis. There is no
   published data concerning the rote of F. necrophorum in recurrent sore
   throats. As the result of an index case of persistent sore throat
   attributable to this organism being diagnosed in our laboratory, a
   subsequent case controlled study (not yet published) isolated F.
   necrophorum from 21\% (P=0.0001) of cases of persistent, recurrent and
   chronic sore throats. The object of this study was to compare isolates
   of F. necrophorum from cases of systemic disease with isolates from
   cases of persistent sore throat syndrome (PSTS) to ascertain whether
   strains of similar type were responsible for both throat and systemic
   disease or whether different strains were involved in these
   presentations.
   Methods. Throat swabs were cultured on GN anaerobe medium (Oxoid) and
   incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 days. Seventeen PSTS isolates were
   identified phenotypically. These were compared to 17 strains isolated
   from blood cultures which were referred to the Anaerobe Reference Unit,
   (ARU) cardiff, using enterogenic repetitive intergenic
   consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR). The control strains
   Fusobacterium necrophorum ssp. necrophorum (JCM 3718(T)) and
   Fusobacterium necrophorum ssp. funduliforme (JCM 3724(T)) from the
   Japanese Collection of Microrganisms (JCM) were tested in parallel with
   the clinical isolates.
   Results. At least 12 separate types were identified. Four of 17 PSTS
   isolates and seven of 17 blood culture isolates grouped together with
   the F. necrophorum ssp. funduliforme control strain. There were also
   similarities between other proposed strains and clinical types but no
   comparison with the F. necrophorurn ssp. necrophorurn control.
   Conclusion. These results show that clinical disease caused by F.
   necrophorum has a wider spectrum than first anticipated. Similar strains
   are able to cause either chronic local or acute systemic disease
   suggesting that genetic factors such as those relating to major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) class may be influencing the outcome of
   the disease in each patient. Further work is required to produce a more
   accurate typing scheme and to ascertain the mechanisms of disease caused
   by this organism.
   An age correlation between the high risk groups for onset of infectious
   mononucleosis (IM), peritonsillar abscess (PTA), LD and PSTS has been
   noted in adolescents and young adults. Further work is required to
   investigate whether IM is associated with the onset of PTA caused by F.
   necrophorurn which may lead to either PSTS or LID. (C) 2005 The British

Abstract = {{Complex nonequilibrium systems are often effectively described by a

   describe how to proceed from a given experimental time series to a
   superstatistical description. We argue that many experimental data fall
   into three different universality classes: chi(2) superstatistics
   (Tsallis statistics), inverse chi(2) superstatistics, and log-normal
   superstatistics. We discuss how to extract the two relevant well
   separated superstatistical time scales tau and T, the probability
   density of the superstatistical parameter beta, and the correlation
   function for beta from the experimental data. We illustrate our approach
   by applying it to velocity time series measured in turbulent
   Taylor-Couette flow, which is well described by log-normal
   superstatistics and exhibits clear time scale separation.}},

   (MDCT) scanners in the emergency admission area greatly facilitates
   initial assessment of the extent of injuries in all body regions, and is
   therefore the emerging standard in all major centres involved in acute

   only allows determining the presence and extent of organ injuries and
   detecting active bleeding sources that may require transarterial
   embolisation for haemostasis, but also serves as a baseline for
   monitoring of conservative treatment. Specific indications for CT
   monitoring of conservative treatment exist in each individual organ.

Abstract = {{Cleaning is a classic example of mutualism and determining the factors
   that maintain the balance between the costs and benefits for mutualist
   partners can assist our understanding of how cleaning relationships are
   maintained. Optimal foraging theory suggests two factors that might help
   to maintain the relationship between cleaners and their clients: client
   ectoparasite load and cleaner hunger levels. The ecological relevance
   and importance of foraging by cleaner fish in marine systems has been
   demonstrated repeatedly, yet there is little information available on
   this behaviour in cleaner shrimp. To determine whether cleaner shrimp
   base their choice of client fish on food patch quality (i.e. client fish
   ectoparasite load) we offered the yellow-beaked cleaner shrimp
   Urocaridella sp. c a choice of parasitized and unparasitized rock cods,
   Cephalopholis cyanostigma. To determine whether cleaner shrimp hunger
   levels influence cleaning time, we manipulated hunger levels in
   Urocaridella sp. c and examined their behaviour towards parasitized
   client fish. Cleaner shrimp preferred parasitized to unparasitized
   client fish and food-deprived cleaner shrimp cleaned parasitized rock
   cods more frequently than satiated cleaner shrimp did. Therefore,
   variations in client fish ectoparasite load and cleaner shrimp hunger
   level are two factors that affect the balance in this mutualism.
   Finally, our results meet some of the assumptions of biological market
   theory, a framework used to understand cooperative interactions, and
   thus this framework is suggested for future studies on this cleaning
   system. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

Abstract = {{It has recently been demonstrated that a large percentage of yearling
   Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha smolts released from a
   production-scale hatchery on the Yakima River display an
   underappreciated life history strategy. Instead of migrating to the
   ocean for long-term rearing and growth, males may instead undertake a
   short-term migration downstream, turn around, and migrate back upstream
   where they reproductively mature at age 2. Following local hatchery
   traditions, these fish are referred to as ``minijacks.{''} We used
   information produced from (1) large-scale passive integrated transponder
   (PIT)-tagging programs at hatcheries in the Columbia and Snake River
   basins and (2) the installation of PIT tag detectors in the fish passage
   ladders built into dams on these rivers to investigate the occurrence,
   behavior, distribution, and origin of minijacks. A minijack was
   operationally defined as a fish detected in a ladder after 1 June in the
   same year it was released. Minijacks were found in every hatchery
   release group of more than 7,500 PIT-tagged Chinook salmon smolts
   reported (2002, 13 groups; 2003, 15 groups). Minijack population
   migration upstream past Bonneville Dam peaked in late June and July.
   This lagged migrations of age-4 adults (from the same populations) by
   approximately 2 months. However, minijacks also displayed
   population-specific variation in timing of upstream migrations past
   Bonneville Dam; minijacks from spring Chinook salmon populations
   appeared before fall Chinook salmon populations. Detection rates of
   minijacks at all dams ranged from 0.02\% to 0.33\% of the total smolts
   released for different hatchery groups. Expansion of this rate, based on
   the relation between minijack estimates at Cle Elum Hatchery (before
   release) and detections at Bonneville Dam (after release), suggests that
   minijack abundance in the Columbia and Snake River basins exceed
   hundreds of thousands of fish.}},

Abstract = {{1. The role of the clinical pharmacologist is to promote the rational,
   safe and effective use of medicines. This revolves around the notion of
   variability, between and within patients and between and within drugs,
   in terms of both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Ideal
   therapeutics involves tailoring the drug and its dosing to the
   individual patient, taking into account this variability.
   2. In the 25 years of my membership of the Australasian Society of
   Clinical and Experimental Pharmacologists and Toxicologists, three
   themes have dominated my research: (i) drugs and breast feeding; (ii)
   aminoglycoside dosing; and (iii) pharmacogenetics. In all these, the
   research has been orientated towards identifying factors involved in
   variability and working towards dose individualization based on the
   understanding of these factors.
   3. Our model for predicting drug concentrations in milk has assisted not
   only in estimating the safety of drug ingestion via breast milk, but
   also in the understanding of the processes involved in drug transfer.
   4. The aminoglycoside studies have assisted in the understanding of the
   basis behind extended interval dosing, leading to a model for dose
   prediction that is widely used, especially in Australasia.
   5. Pharmacogenetics is a field widely acclaimed as having a huge future
   in terms of individualization of drug therapy. Our early studies in this
   area lend only cautious support to this optimism.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Baikal harbors the largest diversity of sponge species {[}phylum
   Porifera] among all freshwater biotopes. The abundantly occurring
   species Lubomirskia baicalensis was used to study the seasonal
   silicatein metabolism; the spicules; of this species have an unusually
   thick axial filament, consisting of silicatein, which remains constant
   in diameter during their growth. In the course of maturation, the size
   of the silicic acid shell grows, until the final diameter of the
   spicules of about 8 pm is reached. The seasonal content of silicatein
   was assessed by use of antibodies raised against silicatein; they
   stained specifically the axial filaments. In addition we determined. by
   application of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system, that the
   proteinaceous content of the spicules. the silicatein, increases from
   spring to late summer by 8-fold. As molecular markers to quantify the
   seasonal changes in expression levels of genes coding for
   proteins/enzymes, the genes for the calumenin-like protein and the
   kinesin-related protein, were selected. The expression of calumenin-like
   gene, involved in the intracellular signaling, is highest during
   September, whereas the expression of the kinesin-related protein does
   not change during the annual course. These results suggest that the
   highest metabolic activity of L. baicalensis occurs in late summer
   (September), in parallel with the highest accumulation of silicatein, a
   structural protein/enzyme of the spicules. (c) 2005 International

Abstract = {{Both chronic excess of PTH, as in hyperparathyroidism, and intermittent
   elevation of PTH ( by daily injections) increase the number of
   osteoblasts; albeit, the former is associated with bone catabolism and
   the later with bone anabolism. Intermittent PTH increases osteoblast
   number by attenuating osteoblast apoptosis, an effect that requires the
   transcription factor Runx2. However, chronic elevation of PTH does not
   affect osteoblast apoptosis because it stimulates the proteasomal
   degradation of Runx2. Here, we studied the effects of PTH on Sost, a
   Runx2 target gene expressed in osteocytes ( former osteoblasts embedded
   in the bone matrix), which antagonizes the pro-osteoblastogenic actions
   of bone morphogenetic proteins and Wnts. We report that continuous
   infusion of PTH to mice for 4 d decreased Sost mRNA expression in
   vertebral bone by 80 - 90\%. This effect was accompanied by a comparable
   reduction of sclerostin, the product of Sost, in osteocytes, as
   determined by quantitative immunoblot analysis of bone extracts and by
   immunostaining. In contrast, a single injection of PTH caused a
   transient 50\% reduction in Sost mRNA at 2 h, but four daily injections
   had no effect on Sost mRNA or sclerostin. PTH strongly decreased Sost
   expression in osteocytes formed in primary cultures of neonatal murine
   calvaria cells as well as in osteocytic MLO-A5 cells, demonstrating a
   direct effect of PTH on this cell type. These results, together with
   evidence that sclerostin antagonizes bone morphogenetic proteins and
   Wnts, strongly suggest that suppression of Sost by PTH represents a
   novel mechanism for hormonal control of osteoblastogenesis mediated by
   osteocytes.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This study was carried out to estimate the relationship
   between arterial Pco(2), (Paco(2)) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2)
   during prehospital controlled ventilation and also to evaluate variation
   of the gradient between Pco(2) and PETCO2 during prehospital transport.
   Methods: Measurements of PETCO2, from capnography values and PaCO2, from
   arterial blood gases were registered at the beginning (T-0) and at the
   end (T-end) of out-of-hospital management. For all patients requiring
   invasive ventilation, the gradient between PCo2 and PETCO2, was
   calculated for T-0 and T-end the PaCo2 - PETCO2 variation between T-end
   and T-0 was also calculated.
   Results: One hundred patients were included in this study (mean age,
   58.4 +/- 16.4 years; 57 were male). There was no variation of the mean
   gradient (Delta PaCO2 - PETCO2) during transport (8.64 +/- 13.5 mm Hg at
   T-0 and 7.26 +/- 12.94 mm Hg at T-end). Thirty-six percent of patients
   (n = 36) had a gradient above +10 mm Hg, and for 6\% of patients (n = 4)
   the gradient was lower than -10 min Hg. The PaCO2 - PETCO2 gradient was
   not significantly different according to the pathology, but was
   significantly higher in hypercapnic patients compared with hypocapnic or
   normocapnic patients. In patients with severe head injury, the capnia
   was normalized in 80\% of patients at the end of the transport according
   to the last blood gas result. In this subgroup the Delta PaCO2 - PETCO2
   (T-end - T-0) gradient was stable between T-0 and T-end except in 20\%
   of the patients for whom the Delta PaCO2 - PETCO2, was lower than - 10
   mm Hg. Fifty-four percent of critical care physicians had modified the
   respiratory setting after the first arterial blood gas results.
   Conclusions: The PaCO2 cannot be estimated by the PETCO2 in the
   prehospital setting. There is wide variation in the gradient between
   PCO2 and PETCO2 depending on patient condition, and over time, the
   relationship does not remain constant and thus cannot be Useful in
   prehospital ventilation management. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The human c-myc proto-oncogene, implicated in the control of many
   cellular processes including cell growth and apoptosis, encodes three
   isoforms which differ in their N-terminal region. The functions of these
   isoforms have never been addressed in vivo. Here, we used Drosophila
   melanagaster to examine their functions in a fully integrated system.
   First, we established that the human c-Myc protein can rescue lethal
   mutations of the Drosophila myc ortholog, dmyc, demonstrating the
   biological relevance of this model. Then. we characterized a new lethal
   dmyc insertion allele, which permits expression of human c-Myc in place
   of dMyc and used it to compare physiological activities of these
   isoforms in whole-organism rescue, transcription, cell growth, and
   apoptosis. These isoforms differ both quantitatively and qualitatively.
   Most remarkably, while the small c-MycS form truncated for much of its
   N-terminal trans-activation domain efficiently rescued viability and
   cell growth, it did not induce detectable programmed cell death. Our
   data indicate that the main functional difference between c-Myc isoforms
   resides in their apoptotic properties and that the N-terminal region,
   containing the conserved MbI motif, is decisive in governing the choice
   between growth and death.}},
