Abstract = {{Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, progressive, deabilitating autoimmune
   disease that occurs in approximately 1\% of adults. Rheumatoid arthritis
   is characterized by chronic polyarthritis and destruction of multiple
   joints. In this study, IgM-antibody removal from human plasma with
   supermacroporous poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) {[}PHEMA] cryogel
   carrying protein A has been evaluated. The PHEMA cryogel was prepared by
   bulk polymerization which proceeds in an aqueous solution of monomer
   frozen inside a plastic syringe (cryo-polymerization). After thawing,
   the PHEMA cryogel contains a continuous matrix having interconnected
   macropores of 10-200 mu m size. Pore volume in the PHEMA cryogel was
   71.6\%. Protein A molecules were covalently immobilized onto the PHEMA
   cryogel via cyanogen bromide (CNBr) activation. The PHEMA cryogel was
   contacted with blood in in vitro system for the determination of
   blood-compatibility. The supermacroporous structure of the PHEMA cryogel
   makes it possible to process blood cells without blocking the cryogel
   column. IgM-antibody adsorption capacity decreased significantly with
   the increase of the plasma flow-rate. The maximum IgM-antibody
   adsorption amount was 42.7 mg/g. IgM-antibody molecules could be
   repeatedly adsorbed and eluted without noticeable loss in the
   IgM-antibody adsorption amount. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The presence of adult specimens and eggs of Temnocephala pignalberiae
   Dioni, 1967 in Dilocarcinus pagei Stimpson, 1861, at Pocone, Brazilian
   `Pantanal', State of Mato Grosso, together with abundant material also
   collected from D. pagei at Bebedouro, State of Sao Paulo, are reported.
   These two records allowed the extension of the known geographical
   distribution of T. pignalberiae from Argentina to Central Brazil, and
   the comparison of the temnocephalan infrapopulations from two allopatric
   crab populations, living approximately 1,300 km apart from each other.
   The entire sample from Pocone and part of the sample from Bebedouro were
   fixed according to our protocols. Juvenile and adult temnocephalans were
   whitish to light pink and presented the typical red-eye pigmentation.
   The worms were living in the branchial chambers, where they deposited
   their eggs, over the tissue covering the inner upper part of the
   carapace. These eggs were thin-shelled and the most delicate, so far
   recorded, for any temnocephalan species our group has studied. The most
   distinctive features of the temnocephalan specimens from the two
   localities representing different watersheds were the: 1. cirrus with
   unarmed introvert; 2. prostatic bulb thick-walled; 3. body ellipsoid,
   with small and more separate tentacles; 4. syncytial plates elongated
   and with similar shape; and 5. excretory pores in the same position
   inside the each syncytial plate. Differing minimally by the: 1.
   contrasting shaft bases - specimens from Pocone, with rims of the shaft
   base directed inward, while specimens from Bebedouro, with straight and
   more open shaft base rims, similar to the shaft bases drawn based on
   specimens found in Argentina; and 2. ratio between cirrus length and
   prostatic bulb length, resulting in longer prostatic bulbs in the
   specimens from Bebedouro. Statistical analysis of measurements taken
   from flattened adult specimens from the infrapopulations of the two
   localities showed only minimal differences in the length and width of
   some organs. This is expected to occur when the same species is
   collected from populations of the same host species living far from each
   other and representing separate watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Tight regulation of cell cycle progression is essential for the
   maintenance of genomic integrity in response to DNA injury. The aim of
   this study was to identify new deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) involved
   in the regulation of the G(2)/M checkpoint. By using an siRNA-based
   screen to identify DUBs with an inherent ability to enhance a
   CDC25B-dependent G(2)/M checkpoint bypass, we have identified 11
   candidates whose invalidation compromises checkpoint stringency. We
   subsequently focused our attention on one of these, the previously
   uncharacterized USP50. Using a TAP-tag approach associated to mass
   spectrometry, in addition to a yeast-two-hybrid screen, we identified
   HSP90 as a major interacting partner for USP50. We also demonstrate
   USP50 depletion causes a loss in accumulation of the HSP90 client Wee1,
   which is an essential component of the G(2)/M cell cycle arrest.
   Finally, we show that in response to DNA damaging agents, USP50
   accumulates in the nucleus. We propose that USP50 may act through a
   HSP90-dependent mechanism to counteract CDC25B mitotic inducing activity
   and prevent Wee1 degradation, thereby repressing entry into mitosis
   following activation of the DNA damage checkpoint.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) due to agriculture crop
   residue burning (ACRB) on children between the age group of 10 to 13
   years and the young between 20 to 35 years are studied. The effects of
   exposure to smoke due to rice-wheat crop residue burning on pulmonary
   functions like Force Vital Capacity (FVC), Force Expiratory Volume in
   one second (FEV1), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) and Force Expiratory Flow
   in 25 to 75\% of FVC (FEF25-75\%) on 40 healthy subjects of
   rural/agricultural area of Sidhuwal village of Patiala City were
   investigated for a period from August 2008 to July 2009. Measurements
   were taken by spirometry according to the American Thoracic Society
   standards. High volume sampler (HVS) and Anderson Impactor were used to
   measure the concentration levels of SPM, PM10 and PM2.5 in ambient air
   of the Sidhuwal village. A significant increase in the concentration
   levels of SPM, PM10 and PM2.5 was observed due to which PFTs of the
   subjects showed a significant decrease in their values, more prominently
   in the case of children. PFTs of young subjects recovered up to some
   extent after the completion of burning period but the PFT values of
   children remained significantly lower (p<0.001) even after the
   completion of burning episodes. Small size particulate matter (PM2.5 and
   PM10) affected the PFTs to a large extent in comparison to the large
   size particulate matter (SPM). The study indicates that ACRB is a
   serious environmental health hazard and children are more sensitive to
   air pollution, as ACRB poses some unrecoverable influence on their PFTs.

Abstract = {{Magnetic properties of Co2MnGe thin films of different thicknesses (13,
   34, 55, 83, 100, and 200 nm), grown by rf sputtering at 400 degrees C on
   single crystal sapphire substrates, were studied using vibrating sample
   magnetometry and conventional or microstrip line ferromagnetic
   resonance. Their behavior is described assuming a magnetic energy
   density showing twofold and fourfold in-plane anisotropies with some
   misalignment between their principal directions. For all the samples,
   the easy axis of the fourfold anisotropy is parallel to the c-axis of
   the substrate while the direction of the twofold anisotropy easy axis
   varies from sample to sample and seems to be strongly influenced by the
   growth conditions. Its direction is most probably monitored by the
   slight unavoidable miscut angle of the Al2O3 substrate. The twofold
   in-plane anisotropy field H-u is almost temperature independent, in
   contrast with the fourfold field H-4 which is a decreasing function of
   the temperature. Finally, we study the frequency dependence of the
   observed line-width of the resonant mode and we conclude to a typical
   Gilbert damping constant alpha value of 0.0065 for the 55-nm-thick film.

Title = {{Assessing the efficacy of a modified assertive community-based treatment
   programme in a developing country}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: A number of recently published randomized controlled trials
   conducted in developed countries have reported no advantage for
   assertive interventions over standard care models. One possible
   explanation could be that so-called ``standard care{''} has become more
   comprehensive in recent years, incorporating some of the salient aspects
   of assertive models in its modus operandi. Our study represents the
   first randomised controlled trial assessing the effect of a modified
   assertive treatment service on readmission rates and other measures of
   outcome in a developing country.
   Methods: High frequency service users were randomized into an
   intervention (n = 34) and a control (n = 26) group. The control group
   received standard community care and the active group an assertive
   intervention based on a modified version of the international model of
   assertive community treatment. Study visits were conducted at baseline
   and 12 months with demographic and illness information collected at
   visit 1 and readmission rates documented at study end. Symptomatology
   and functioning were measured at both visits using the PANSS, CDSS,
   ESRS, WHO-QOL and SOFAS.
   Results: At 12 month follow-up subjects receiving the assertive
   intervention had significantly lower total PANSS (p = 0.02) as well as
   positive (p < 0.01) and general psychopathology (p = 0.01) subscales'
   scores. The mean SOFAS score was also significantly higher (p = 0.02)
   and the mean number of psychiatric admissions significantly lower (p <
   0.01) in the intervention group.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that assertive interventions in a
   developing setting where standard community mental services are often
   under resourced can produce significant outcomes. Furthermore, these
   interventions need not be as expensive and comprehensive as
   international, first-world models in order to reduce inpatient days,
   improve psychopathology and overall levels of functioning in patients
   with severe mental illness.}},

Abstract = {{An unstructured model for growth and lactic acid production during

   kinetics. Production models was based on modified Luedeking-Piret
   expressions involving an inhibitory effect for the first stage (seed
   culture) and a nutritional limitation effect for the second stage
   (culture). To account for the decrease of the biomass concentration
   observed in the second stage, the dilution rate D-c was replaced by an
   exponential term of the dilution rate alpha exp(D-c/beta) in the growth
   and product relations. Contrarily to the previous model, the important
   decrease of the biomass concentration observed at steady state in the
   second stage at high dilution rates, namely close to wash out, was
   correctly described by the new model. It also proved to satisfactory

Abstract = {{Despite the imminent commercial introduction of Li-ion batteries in
   electric drive vehicles and their proposed use as enablers of smart
   grids based on renewable energy technologies, an intensive quest for new
   electrode materials that bring about improvements in energy density,
   cycle life, cost, and safety is still underway. This Progress Report
   highlights the recent developments and the future prospects of the use
   of phases that react through conversion reactions as both positive and
   negative electrode materials in Li-ion batteries. By moving beyond
   classical intercalation reactions, a variety of low cost compounds with
   gravimetric specific capacities that are two-to-five times larger than
   those attained with currently used materials, such as graphite and
   LiCoO2, can be achieved. Nonetheless, several factors currently handicap
   the applicability of electrode materials entailing conversion reactions.
   These factors, together with the scientific breakthroughs that are
   necessary to fully assess the practicality of this concept, are reviewed
   in this report.}},

Abstract = {{Since the post-casting treatments influence the water entrapped in
   polymeric matrix and consequently its proton conductivity, an evaluation
   of annealing at 200 degrees C and acid treatments was conducted on
   previously developed composite s-PEEK (1.55 mequiv.g(-1)) membranes,
   containing a commercial aminopropyl-functionalised silica. DSC, WAXS,
   SEM-EDX and laser microscope measurements carried out on membranes
   swollen at different temperatures highlighted different membrane
   properties depending on post-casting treatments. It was found that
   composite membranes have different structural and morphological
   characteristics than pristine polymer membranes. The silica distribution
   was modified when different treatments are used. The state of water
   changed when silica was inserted into the membranes. Actually, contrary
   to the pristine membranes the presence of freezable water was revealed
   at temperature lower than 80 degrees C. The proton conductivity was also
   affected by the presence and the amount of water trapped into the
   membranes and was particularly influenced by the post-casting
   treatments. The silica introduction reduced the swelling effect and
   improved the robustness of the membranes even if a higher water content
   in the freezable state was observed. Acid treatment leads to significant
   improvement in membrane properties, but the present work shows that
   annealing before acid treatment can affect the membrane morphology more
   strongly than other treatments resulting in a much better fuel cell
   performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) of Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa is a particularly successful cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogen
   associated with transmissibility, increased patient morbidity, and,
   unusually, infection of the non-CF parents of a patient with CF.
   Methods. Using assays for virulence-associated exoproducts, biofilm
   formation, Caenorhabditis elegans killing, and a murine model of acute
   respiratory infection, we compared the pathogenic behavior of
   representatives of 4 subtypes of the LES, including LES431, an isolate
   associated with the infection of a parent without CF.
   Results. The quorum-sensing-defective lasR mutant LES400 produced less
   exoproduct and had less C. elegans killing activity than the other LES
   subtypes, which were represented by LES431, LESB58, and LESB65. LES431
   was deficient in biofilm formation, compared with the other LES
   sub-types. The LES subtypes displayed a range of virulence in the mouse
   model, with LES431 being by far the most virulent. The genome-sequenced
   isolate LESB58, effective at establishing infections in a rat model of
   chronic infection, was the least virulent subtype in the murine acute
   infection model.

Abstract = {{Hypoxia exists in every solid tumor and is associated with poor
   prognosis because of both local and systemic therapeutic resistance.
   Recent studies have focused on the interaction between tumor cell
   genetics and the dynamic state of oxygenation and metabolism. Hypoxia
   generates aggressive tumor cell phenotypes in part owing to ongoing
   genetic instability and a ``mutator{''} phenotype. The latter may be due
   to suppression of DNA mismatch repair (MMR), nucleotide excision repair
   (NER), and double-strand break (DSB) repair. We propose a theoretical
   model in which hypoxia-mediated defects in DNA repair can lead to
   ``contextual loss of heterozygosity{''} and drive oncogenesis.
   Additionally, hypoxia-mediated repair defects can be specifically
   targeted by DNA damaging agents and/or ``contextual synthetic
   lethality{''} to kill repair-deficient cells and preserve the
   therapeutic ratio. These proposed concepts support the interrogation of
   solid tumors to document repair defects in both oxic and hypoxic tumor
   subregions as a conduit to novel clinical trials within the context of
   personalized medicine. Clin Cancer Res; 16(18); 4553-60. (c) 2010 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{A new strategy for development of electrochemical DNA biosensor based on
   site-specific DNA cleavage of restriction endonuclease and using quantum
   dots as reporter was reported in this paper The biosensor was fabricated
   by immobilizing a capture hairpin probe, thiolated single strand DNA
   labeled with biotin group, on a gold electrode BfuCl nuclease, which is
   able to specifically cleave only double strand DNA but not single strand
   DNA, was used to reduce background current and Improve the sensitivity
   We demonstrated that the capture hairpin probe can be cleaved by BfuCl
   nuclease in the absence of target DNA, but cannot be cleaved in the
   presence of target DNA. The difference before and after enzymatic
   cleavage was then monitored by electrochemical method after the quantum
   dots were dissolved from the hybrids Our results suggested that the
   usage of BfuCl nuclease obviously Improved the sensitivity and
   selectivity of the biosensor. We successfully applied this method to the
   sequence-selective discrimination between perfectly matched and
   mismatched target DNA including a single-base mismatched target DNA, and
   detected as low as 3 3 x 10(-14) M of complementary target DNA
   Furthermore, our above strategy was also verified with fluorescent
   method by designing a fluorescent molecular beacon (MB), which combined
   the capture hairpin probe and a pair of fluorophore (TAMRA) and quencher
   (DABCYL) The fluorescent results are consistent with that of
   electroanalysis, further indicating that the proposed new strategy
   indeed works as we expected (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of
   2'-3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-adenosine-5'-triphosphate (Bz-ATP), a P2X7
   receptor agonist, on action potential-independent glutamate release from
   nerve terminals attached to mechanically isolated immature hilar
   neurons. Bz-ATP increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current
   (sEPSC) frequency, and this effect was blocked by Brilliant blue G, a
   P2X7 receptor antagonist, suggesting that P2X7 receptors mediate the
   facilitatory action of Bz-ATP on sEPSCs. In most of hilar neurons
   tested, the Bz-ATP-induced increase in sEPSC frequency was blocked by
   tetrodotoxin or Cd2+, suggesting that the activation of P2X7 receptors
   leads to a presynaptic depolarization. The P2X7 receptor-mediated
   facilitation of glutamate release would modulate the excitability of
   hilar neurons, and eventually have a broad impact on the
   pathophysiological functions mediated by the hippocampus. NeuroReport

Abstract = {{The development of HIV drugs is an expensive and a lengthy process. In
   this study, we used drug repositioning, a process whereby a drug
   approved to treat one condition is used to treat a different condition,
   to identify clinically approved drugs that have anti-HIV activity. The
   data presented here show that a combination of two clinically approved
   drugs, decitabine and gemcitabine, reduced HIV infectivity by 73\% at
   concentrations that had minimal antiviral activity when used
   individually. Decreased infectivity coincided with a significant
   increase in mutation frequency and a shift in the HIV mutation spectrum.
   These results indicate that an increased mutational load is the primary
   antiviral mechanism for inhibiting the generation of infectious progeny
   virus from provirus. Similar results were seen when decitabine was used
   in combination with another ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor. Our
   results suggest that HIV infectivity can be decreased by combining a
   nucleoside analog that forms noncanonical base pairs with certain
   ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors. Such drug combinations are relevant
   since members of these drug classes are used clinically. Our
   observations support a model in which increased mutation frequency
   decreases infectivity through lethal mutagenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Contamination of shooting range soils with toxic trace elements, in
   particular Pb and Sb, is of increasing environmental concern worldwide.
   We studied the extractability of Sb, and other metals ill two shooting
   range soils: a calcareous soil (pH 8) with low organic carbon (0.5\%)
   and a non-calcareous soil (pH 6.3) with elevated organic carbon content
   (5\%). Both soils contained total concentrations of around 500 mg kg(-1)
   Pb, 65 mg kg(-1) Cu, 100 mg kg(-1) Zn and 20 mg kg(-1) Sb. We tested the
   effects of Ca(OH)(2), phosphate and sodium humate amendments on metals
   and Sb extractability. Extracts with H(2)O and NaNO(3) contained
   0.02-0.05\% of the total Zn and Pb; 0.1-0.5\% of total Ni and Cu and
   similar to 1\% of total Sb. Sequential extraction procedure of Zeien and
   Brummer resulted in similar percentages for the sum of the two most
   labile fractions (F1 + F2) in two soils: 10\% Pb, and 15-20\% Sb. Water
   and NaNO(3)-extractable Sb concentrations increased after phosphate
   addition, but were not affected by the addition of sodium humate. The
   results show that leaching of Sb from shooting ranges into ground and
   surface waters may generate a serious environmental risk under widely
   different soils conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of olive mill wastewaters (OMW) by membrane techniques were
   investigated in this study. For this purpose. OMW was centrifuged, and
   filtered via UC010 ultrafiltration membrane followed by filtration
   through NP010, NP030, and NF270 nanofiltration membranes, and XLE and
   BW30 reverse osmosis membranes. Besides, skipping the ultrafiltration
   step, the centrifuged OMW was filtered through NP010 and NP030 membranes
   in order to evaluate the performance of the centrifuging process as a
   pretreatment option. For the OMW percolated through ultrafiltration
   membranes, the membrane fluxes reached values of up to 21.2, 5.2, 28.3,
   15.5, and 12.6 L m(-2)h(-1) for NP010, NP030, NF270, XLE, and BW30
   membranes, respectively. The maximum COD removal efficiencies obtained
   at 10 bars were 60.1\%. 59.4\% and 79.2\% for NP010, NP030, and NF270
   nanofiltration membranes, respectively, while they were 96.3\% and
   96.2\% for XLE and BW30 reverse osmosis membranes, respectively.
   Besides, conductivity removal efficiencies obtained at 25 bars were
   93.2\% and 94.8\% for XLE and BW30 membranes. respectively. Obtained
   efficiencies are higher than those obtained in the treatment of OMWs
   with other treatment methods. Thus, it was concluded that membrane
   processes are a good alternative for the treatment of OMWs.
   Additionally, the centrifuging process was found to be a promising
   pretreatment method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Th17 cells are proinflammatory cells associated with many
   immune-mediated diseases. Major factors limiting the study of human Th17
   cells are the lack of an accepted method for their in vitro
   differentiation or for isolation of a homogenous population of Th17
   cells that do not cosecrete IFN-gamma. To overcome these hurdles, we
   established a novel method to isolate in vivo differentiated Th17 cells
   from peripheral blood by sorting CD161(+)CCR4(+)CCR6(+)CXCR32(-)CD4(+) T
   cells. The resulting cells produce high levels of IL-17 but not
   IFN-gamma, express high levels of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor
   variant 2, and maintain this phenotype upon expansion. Ex vivo Th17
   cells exhibit a low cytotoxic potential and are hyporesponsive to
   polyclonal anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation. Importantly, ex vivo Th17
   cells were susceptible to suppression by both naive and memory
   regulatory T cells (Tregs), which inhibited production of IL-17, IL-22,
   and CXCL8. Moreover, Tregs suppressed the antifibrotic effects of Th17
   cells in a wound-healing model. These findings provide new tools for the
   study of normal and pathological functions of bona fide Th17 cells in
   humans. They also provide new insight into the cross-talk between Th17
   cells and immune and nonimmune cells, and they establish the paradigm
   that adoptive Treg-based therapies may effectively limit Th17-mediated
   inflammation. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185: 3199-3208.}},

Abstract = {{The presence and configuration of Au on the sidewalls of
   vapor-liquid-solid grown Si nanowires (NWs) was investigated using
   analytical (scanning) transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The
   relationship between growth conditions and Au/Si interface
   thermodynamics is shown to have a profound effect on NW growth. For some
   growth conditions, liquid AuSi can spread from the seed at the NW tip
   along the sidewalls during growth. This liquid film will phase separate
   and solidify, forming small Au clusters as the NW is cooled from the
   growth temperature. Growth conditions are correlated with the variety of
   Au cluster configurations found. The observed behavior can be explained
   by considering the thermodynamics of droplet spreading on cylinders. (C)

Abstract = {{We have recently introduced a macaque (Macaca mulatta) model of
   Leishmania brazihensis-induced chronic granulomatous cutaneous lesions
   affecting the nasal mucosa. Using an L braziliensis strain that produces
   self-healing dermal lesions in macaques, here we characterises the
   systemic and local cell-mediated immune responses that led to controlled
   growth of granulomas in the infected host As detected using flow
   cytomeny, more cytokine-producing T-cell subsets were observed in
   granuloma-derived leukocytes that were analysed directly ex vivo than in
   the in vitro-restimulated cells from the peripheral blood and
   skin-draining lymph nodes (dLNs). We demonstrate that antigen-specific
   interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)- or tumour necrosis factor alpha
   (TNF-alpha)-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells are likely important for
   the immunological effectiveness of granulomas. However, their resolution
   can be ascribed to the concomitant recruitment of interleukin
   (IL)-10-producing CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells that suppress
   the effector T-cell-mediated inflammatory response. The findings confirm
   that the macaque model can be used to fully elucidate the regulatory
   mechanisms that may render granulomas inadequate for fighting
   intracellular pathogens, which will need to be considered in the
   development of any therapeutic strategy designed to prevent immune
   pathology (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ni2+-imprinted monolithic column was prepared for the removal of nickel
   ions from aqueous solutions. N-Methacryloyl-L-histidine was used as a
   complexing monomer for Ni2+ ions in the preparation of the
   Ni2+-imprinted monolithic column. The Ni2+-imprinted poly(hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate-N-methacryloyl-L-histidine) (PHEMAH) monolithic column was
   synthesized by bulk polymerization. The template ion (Ni2+) was removed
   with a 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol (PAR):NH3- NH4Cl solution. The
   water-uptake ratio of the PHEMAH-Ni2+ monolith increased compared with
   PHEMAH because of the formation of nickel-ion cavities in the polymer
   structure. The adsorption of Ni2+ ions on both the PHEMAH-Ni2+ and
   PHEMAH monoliths were studied. The maximum adsorption capacity was 0.211
   mg/g for the PHEMAH-Ni2+ monolith. Fe3+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ ions were used
   as competitive species in the selectivity experiments. The PHEMAH-Ni2+
   monolithic column was 268.8, 25.5, and 10.4 times more selective than
   the PHEMAH monolithic column for the Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+ ions,
   respectively. The PHEMAH-Ni2+ monolithic column could be used repeatedly
   without a decrease in the Ni2+ adsorption capacity. (C) 2010 Wiley

Abstract = {{Physiotherapy is widely used in Parkinson's disease (PD), but there are
   few controlled studies comparing active interventions. Recently, a
   technique named ``LSVT (R) BIG'' has been introduced. LSVT (R) BIG is
   derived from the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment and focuses on intensive
   exercising of high-amplitude movements. In the present comparative
   study, 60 patients with mild to moderate PD were randomly assigned to
   receive either one-to-one training (BIG), group training of Nordic
   Walking (WALK), or domestic nonsupervised exercises (HOME). Patients in
   training (BIG) and WALK received 16 hours of supervised training within
   4 (BIG) or 8 (WALK) weeks. The primary efficacy measure was difference
   in change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor
   score from baseline to follow-up at 16 weeks between groups. UPDRS
   scores were obtained by blinded video rating. ANCOVA showed significant
   group differences for UPDRS-motor score at final assessment (P < 0.001).
   Mean improvement of UPDRS in BIG was -5.05 (SD 3.91) whereas there was a
   mild deterioration of 0.58 (SD 3.17) in WALK and of 1.68 (SD 5.95) in
   HOME. LSVT (R) BIG was also superior to WALK and HOME in timed-up-and-go
   and timed 10 m walking. There were no significant group differences for
   quality of life (PDQ39). These results provide evidence that LSVT (R)
   BIG is an effective technique to improve motor performance in patients
   with PD. (C) 2010 Movement Disorder Society}},

Abstract = {{Wilms' tumour suppressor gene, WT1, is mutated/deleted in similar to
   15\% of Wilms' tumours, highly expressed in the majority of other
   cancers and is essential for normal embryonic development. The gene
   encodes multiple isoforms of a zinc-finger (ZF) protein with diverse
   cellular functions, in particular participating in both transcriptional
   and post-transcriptional gene regulation. Physical interactions of other
   cellular proteins with WT1 are known to modulate its function. However,
   despite the isolation of several WT1-binding proteins, the mechanisms
   involved in regulating WT1 activities are not clearly understood. In
   this study, we report the identification of the Kruppel-like ZF protein,
   ZNF224, as a novel human WT1-associating protein and demonstrate that
   ZNF224 and its isoform ZNF255 show a specific pattern of interaction
   with the WT1 splicing variants WT1(-KTS) and WT1(+KTS). These
   interactions occur in different subcellular compartments and are devoted
   to control different cellular pathways. The nuclear interaction between
   ZNF224 and WT1(-KTS) results in an increase in trascriptional activation
   mediated by WT1, implying that ZNF224 acts as a co-regulator of WT1,
   whereas, on the contrary, the results obtained for ZNF255 suggest a role
   for this protein in RNA processing together with WT1. Moreover, our data
   give the first functional information about the involvement of ZNF255 in
   a specific molecular pathway, RNA maturation and processing.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) represents the most
   frequent proliferative abnormality of the human prostate. In spite of
   the well-characterized architectural development of BPH, little is known
   about the cellular and molecular events that contribute to it.
   METHODS. We have developed an animal model to evaluate the follow-up of
   hormone-induced BPH and the analysis of the gene expression associated
   with BPH. Immunohistochemistry on human patient samples validated the
   BPH-related molecular alterations.
   RESULTS. Canine specific Affymetrix microarray analysis performed on
   sequential biopsies obtained from a beagle dog dynamic model
   characterized a number of genes altered during the onset of BPH. In
   addition to the genes involved in calcification, matrix remodeling,
   detoxification, cell movement, and mucosa protection (MGP, MMP2, TIMP2,
   ITIH3, GST, MT2A, SULT1A1, FKBP1B, MUC1, STRBP, TFF3), the up-regulation
   of TGFB3 and CLU indicated a complete adjustment of the
   transdifferentiation, senescence and apoptosis programs. The
   up-regulation of Clusterin was validated by RT-qPCR and
   immunohistochemistry, both in the dog dynamic model and in human
   samples, further confirming the suitability of the animal model for the
   study of the molecular alterations associated with BPH.
   CONCLUSIONS. Transcriptome analysis performed on a dynamic animal model
   that accurately mimicked the human clinic, allowed us to characterize a
   gene expression pattern associated with the onset of BPH. Prostate 70:

   Pd43Ni10Cu27P20 alloy are determined calorimetrically as a function of
   temperature. Along with eight other BMG forming alloys, the available
   experimental thermodynamic and viscosity data are reassessed. For each
   alloy, consistent Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) fits of the viscosity
   measurements are established, and the temperature dependence of the
   configurational entropy is calculated from thermodynamic data. Together
   with the VFT fits, fits to the Adam-Gibbs equation are performed using
   this configurational entropy change. We find remarkable agreement
   between the Adam-Gibbs and VFT fits. Moreover, the temperature T-0 is
   obtained from the VFT fits at which the viscous flow diverges. This T-0
   matches very well the temperature where the configurational entropy
   vanishes in the corresponding Adam-Gibbs fits. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{It has been clearly demonstrated that ultraviolet radiation is harmful
   to the skin and can cause helioderma and cancers. There are different
   methods of combating ultraviolet radiation: sunscreens formulated with
   filters and/or screens as well as clothing. For this work, the authors
   studied different fabrics to evaluate what effect the type, color and
   thickness of an article of clothing might have in terms of providing UVB
   (UPF) and UVA (UPF-UVA) protection. This study was conducted using a
   spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere and allowed the
   authors to discover that certain fabrics have UPF values which exceed
   500, making them vastly superior to sunscreen creams. Synthetic fabrics
   appear to provide the highest level of sun protection. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to increase exchange area or specific area of
   the membrane unit containing the ceramic membranes in order to achieve a
   compacity of over 330 m(2)/m(3). Several configurations were studied by
   varying parameters like the diameter, membrane geometry, and the form of
   channels (cylindrical, square-section, triangular, hexagonal, etc.).
   Taking manufacturing constraints into account, several optimized
   geometries were described, thus allowing the optimization of the
   filtration area for each module. In this way, membrane compacity was
   significantly improved. Therefore a substantial increase in the permeate
   flux was expected and it was important to verify the capacity of the
   porous media to evacuate such permeate flux. Computational fluid
   dynamics analysis was used to simulate permeate evacuation as well as
   the flow-rate of each individual channel in the monolith. The optimal
   geometries could then be determined as a function of this permeate
   flow-rate and/or cut-off threshold. The experimental results obtained
   with water were in good agreement with those obtained by numerical
   simulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Adenovirus (Ad)-mediated E2F-1 gene transfer induces
   apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, but clinical application
   of E2F-1 in cancer gene therapy remains controversial because of the
   oncogenic potential of E2F-1. This barrier can be circumvented by using
   the truncated form of the E2F-1 gene (E2Ftr) (amino acids 1 through
   375), which lacks the E2F-1 transactivation domain and cell
   cycle-promoting effects.
   METHODS: The authors constructed 3 adenoviral vectors that expressed
   E2Ftr under regulation of the tetracycline (Tet)-off system
   (AdTet-E2Ftr1, AdTet-E2Ftr2, and AdTet-E2Ftr3). These vectors were
   compared for E2Ftr expression and apoptosis induction in cancer cells
   and normal cells. E2Ftr antitumor activity in vivo also was assessed in
   a melanoma xenograft model.
   RESULTS: One of the 3 vectors, AdTet-E2Ftr3, had the highest E2Ftr
   protein expression levels, which were correlated with the greatest
   induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cancer cell growth. E2Ftr
   induced apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines independent of p53
   status with little cytotoxicity in normal cell lines. In a mouse
   melanoma xenograft model, AdTet-E2Ftr3 exhibited an approximately 80\%
   decrease in tumor size compared with controls in vivo.
   CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that AdTet-E2Ftr3 is a novel
   anticancer agent that has significant therapeutic activity in vitro and
   in vivo. Cancer 2010;116:4420-32. (C) 2010 American Cancer Society.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the possibility to partially replace the classical Fluid
   Catalytic Cracking (FCC) feedstocks by bio-oils derived from
   lignocellulosic biomass, the transformation of n-heptane was performed
   in the presence of small quantities of phenol over an HY zeolite, at 350
   and 450 degrees C. The results were compared with those previously
   obtained with methylcyclohexane. Phenol leads to a further deactivation
   of the zeolite due to phenol adsorption on the Bronsted and Lewis acid
   sites along with coke molecules from the reactants transformation. For
   n-heptane. the additional activity decay due to phenol is observed since
   the beginning of the reaction, while for methylcyclohexane it was only
   detected after few minutes. The increase of temperature disfavours
   phenol adsorption but, contrarily to methylcyclohexane, it does not
   prevent the phenol deactivating effect for n-heptane. Differences in the
   reactivity of n-heptane and methylcyclohexane molecules and IR
   spectroscopy data allow concluding that phenol firstly interacts with
   the stronger protonic sites, being then retained on the weaker acid
   sites. Alkylation of phenol is a reaction occurring in a lower extent
   under the conditions tested, being responsible for the consumption of
   light olefins. Finally, the adsorption of phenol favours the formation
   of branched molecules. Hence, the alkanes cracking should be more
   affected than the naphthenes cracking in the co-processing of
   conventional FCC feedstocks with hydrotreated bio-oils rich in phenolic
   compounds, being the deactivating effect certainly dependent on the
   quantity of bio-oils incorporated.(c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A pectin-based hydrogel was used as a remover of Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions from
   water and wastewater and in the release of phosphate, potassium, and
   urea. The swelling studies in either aqueous or saline solutions were
   analyzed at different pressures, and the prediction of profile of water
   and solute transports was further analyzed on basis of transport process
   by diffusion in swellable polymer networks. The hydrogel composed of
   0.10 g mL(-1) final polymer concentration showed an excellent absorption
   capacity for removal of Cu2+ and Pb2+ from the solution: 120 mg Cu2+ and
   130 mg Pb2+ per g hydrogel, both at pH 5.5. The hydrogel help to
   conserve water in a pressure range in which a variety of horticultural
   plants can absorb it. The release process of urea, phosphate, and
   potassium from the hydrogels is controlled by non-Fickian mechanism with
   a tendency to macromolecular relaxation. This type of hydrogel is an
   interesting system for applications in which the efficient use of water
   is required and release of fertilizers for agriculture. (C) 2010 Wiley

   solutions. The structures of the diimine Schiff bases were confirmed by
   elemental analyses. ESI-MS, FT-IR, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectroscopy.
   The phenol-imine and keto-amine tautomerism of the Schiff bases were
   investigated by FT-IR, 1 H NMR,13C NMR techniques and UV-vis spectra in

Abstract = {{The full sequence of signals leading to new blood vessel formation is a
   physiological response to tissue hypoxia through upregulation of
   angiogenic factor cascades. Controlled initiation of this mechanism for
   therapeutic/engineered angiogenesis must rely on precisely localized
   hypoxia. Here we have designed a 3D in vitro model able to test the
   effect and predictability of spatially positioned local hypoxic stimuli
   using defined cell depots within a 3D collagen matrix. Cell-mediated
   hypoxia was engineered using human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), to
   generate a local population of Hypoxia-Induced Signaling (HIS) cells.
   HIS cell depots released angiogenic factors which induced directional
   endothelial cell (EC) migration and tubule formation in a spatially
   defined assay system. Non-hypoxic baseline control cultures induced
   minimal EC migration with little tubule formation. Furthermore, depots
   of HIS cells, positioned in the core of 3D collagen constructs directed
   host vessel in-growth deep into the implant by 1 week, which was at
   least 7 days earlier than in non-hypoxia pre-conditioned constructs. The
   functionality of in vivo vascularisation was verified by real-time
   monitoring of O-2 levels in the core of implanted constructs. These
   findings establish the angiogenic potential of HIS cells applicable to
   in vitro tissue modeling, implant vascularization and engineering
   predictable angiogenic therapies. (c) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights

Abstract = {{We developed a cloud mask scheme that combines measurements from
   CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite
   Observation (CALIPSO) satellites. First, we developed a cloud mask
   scheme for CALIPSO using a threshold of the attenuated total
   backscattering coefficient and a spatial continuity test. We then
   developed a combined CloudSat-CALIPSO cloud mask. These cloud masks were
   applied to 3 months of data from September to November 2006, and the
   vertical distributions of zonal mean cloud fractions and cloud coverage
   were analyzed. We also examined the standard vertical feature mask (VFM)
   cloud scheme. The VFM occasionally made false detections because of its
   horizontal averaging procedure and seemed to misclassify noise or
   aerosols as clouds. In addition, the VFM appeared to significantly
   overestimate low-level clouds. Below 2 km, the cloud fraction differed
   by as much as 25\% between the VFM and our combined scheme. We also
   compared the zonal mean cloud coverage for the topmost layer detected by
   the sensors using our CALIPSO scheme, the VFM, our combined
   CloudSat-CALIPSO scheme, and the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) results. For low-level clouds (> 680 hPa), the
   MODIS result was larger than that of our CloudSat-CALIPSO scheme, and
   results from the VFM and our CALIPSO scheme differed by as much as 15\%.
   The CALIPSO, CloudSat-CALIPSO, and MODIS results were similar for total
   cloud coverage, but the VFM result was different. Because of possible
   misclassification at low levels, the VFM showed the largest cloud
   coverage in middle and low latitudes.}},

Title = {{LOW ACCUMULATION OF DREBRIN AT GLUTAMATERGIC POSTSYNAPTIC SITES ON

Abstract = {{Glutamatergic synapses form onto both glutamatergic and GABAergic
   neurons. These two types of glutamatergic synapses differ in their
   electrical responses. to high-frequency stimulation and postsynaptic
   density protein composition. However, it is not known whether they
   differ in the actin cytoskeleton composition. In the present study, we
   used hippocampal neuronal cultures prepared from glutamate decarboxylase
   67 (GAD67)-GFP knock-in mice and analyzed the differences in the actin
   cytoskeleton at glutamatergic synapses contacting GABAergic and
   glutamatergic neurons. Drebrin-binding actin filaments enriched in
   dendritic spines are known to play a pivotal role in spine formation.
   Immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated that drebrin accumulated at
   glutamatergic synapses on GABAergic neurons as well as at those on
   glutamatergic neurons. However, the density of drebrin clusters along
   dendrites in GABAergic neurons was significantly lower than those of
   glutamatergic neurons. Furthermore, the level of drebrin accumulating at
   glutamatergic synapses was lower on GABAergic neurons than on
   glutamatergic neurons. In neurons overexpressing drebrin, drebrin
   cluster density and accumulation levels in GABAergic and glutamatergic
   neurons were similar, suggesting that the low drebrin levels in the
   glutamatergic postsynaptic sites on GABAergic neurons may be because
   GABAergic neurons express low levels of drebrin. On the other hand,
   pharmacological analysis demonstrated that the postsynaptic localization
   of drebrin depended on actin cytoskeleton organization in both GABAergic
   and glutamatergic neurons. Together these results indicated that,
   although GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons share common regulatory
   systems affecting drebrin localization, the density of drebrin-positive
   glutamatergic synapses formed on GABAergic neurons is lower than those
   on glutamatergic neurons. This is probably due to the low expression of
   drebrin in GABAergic neurons. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Two typical highly porous metal-organic framework (MOF) materials based
   on chromium-benzenedicarboxylates (Cr-BDC) obtained from Material of
   Institute Lavoisier with special structure of MIL-101 and MIL-53 have
   been used for the adsorptive removal of methyl orange (MO), a harmful
   anionic dye, from aqueous solutions. The adsorption capacity and
   adsorption kinetic constant of MIL-101 are greater than those of MIL-53,
   showing the importance of porosity and pore size for the adsorption. The
   performance of MIL-101 improves with modification: the adsorption
   capacity and kinetic constant are in the order of MIL-101 <
   ethylenediamine-grafted MIL-101 < protonated ethylenediamine-grafted
   MIL-101 (even though the porosity and pore size are slightly decreased
   with grafting and further protonation). The adsorption capacity of
   protonated ethylenediamine-grafted MIL-101 decreases with increasing the
   pH of an aqueous MO solution. These results suggest that the adsorption
   of MO on the MOF is at least partly due to the electrostatic interaction
   between anionic MO and a cationic adsorbent. Adsorption of MO at various
   temperatures shows that the adsorption is a spontaneous and endothermic
   process and that the entropy increases (the driving force of the
   adsorption) with MO adsorption. The adsorbent MIL-101s are re-usable
   after sonification in water. Based on this study, MOFs can be suggested
   as potential re-usable adsorbents to remove anionic dyes because of
   their high porosity, facile modification and ready re-activation. (C)

Abstract = {{The accurate duplication of chromosomal DNA is required to maintain
   genomic integrity. However, from an evolutionary point of view, a low
   mutation rate during DNA replication is desirable. One way to strike the
   right balance between accuracy and limited mutagenesis is to use a DNA
   polymerase that lacks proofreading activity but contributes to DNA
   replication in a very restricted manner. DNA polymerase-alpha fits this
   purpose exactly, but little is known about its regulation at the
   replication fork. Minichromosome maintenance protein (Mcm) 10 regulates
   the stability of the catalytic subunit of pol-alpha in budding yeast and
   human cells. Cdc17, the catalytic subunit of pol-alpha in yeast, is
   rapidly degraded after depletion of Mcm10. Here we show that Ubc4 and
   Not4 are required for Cdc17 destabilization. Disruption of Cdc17
   turnover resulted in sensitivity to hydroxyurea, suggesting that this
   pathway is important for DNA replication. Furthermore, overexpression of
   Cdc17 in ubc4 and not4 mutants caused slow growth and synthetic dosage
   lethality, respectively. Our data suggest that Cdc17 levels are very
   tightly regulated through the opposing forces of Ubc4 and Not4
   (destabilization) and Mcm10 (stabilization). We conclude that regular
   turnover of Cdc17 via Ubc4 and Not4 is required for proper cell
   proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, the L-tryptophan-degrading enzyme, plays a
   key role in the powerful immunomodulatory effects on several different
   types of cells. Because modulation of IDO activities after viral
   infection may have great impact on disease progression, we investigated
   the role of IDO following infection with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus.
   We found suppressed BM5 provirus copies and increased type I IFNs in the
   spleen from IDO knockout (IDO-/-) and 1-methyl-D-L-tryptophan-treated
   mice compared with those from wild-type (WT) mice. Additionally, the
   number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in IDO-/- mice was higher in the
   former than in the WT mice. In addition, neutralization of type I IFNs
   in IDO-/- mice resulted in an increase in LP-BM5 viral replication.
   Moreover, the survival rate of IDO-/- mice or
   1-methyl-D-L-tryptophan-treated mice infected with LP-BM5 alone or with
   both Toxoplasma gondii and LP-BM5 was clearly greater than the survival
   rate of WT mice. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report
   to observe suppressed virus replication with upregulated type I IFN in
   IDO-/- mice, suggesting that modulation of the IDO pathway may be an
   effective strategy for treatment of virus infection. The Journal of

Abstract = {{As of today, contractual agreements govern the terms of interaction
   between users and providers as well as between interoperating providers.
   Such contracts indicate usable services and resources, tariffs, payment
   methods, etc. Typically, these terms are negotiated once before the
   contract is signed and are seldom changed thereafter, such that
   contracts are rather static and inflexible. Furthermore, establishing
   such a contract requires human involvement. As a consequence, it is
   difficult for small content or access providers to reach users and to
   find interoperation partners amongst the large operators. In addition,
   providers in general lack flexibility with respect to charging according
   to demand, and users are unable to easily change their preferred access
   and service conditions depending on their current life situation and
   location. Supporting automated and dynamic negotiation of contractual
   agreements as well as implementing these agreements in an automated, ad
   hoc fashion are therefore key requirements for compensation systems in
   future mobile networks. In this paper we propose a functional
   compensation architecture that meets these key requirements. The
   architecture is furthermore designed to be able to operate atop of
   current compensation systems and thus protects and even leverages prior
   investments. Finally, the architecture allows for the integration of
   different legacy and non-legacy compensation-related components and thus
   supports heterogeneous systems. The description of the conceptual
   architecture in this work is complemented by presenting a prototype
   including first performance indicators. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   uniform free stream, with the bottom surface of the plate is heated by
   convection from a hot fluid is considered. Similarity solutions for the

   the surface and the convective heat transfer from the hot fluid on the

Journal = {{VIROLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: The prevalence of HIV/hepatitis co-infection in sub-Saharan
   Africa is not well documented, while both HIV and HBV are endemic in
   this area.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the seroprevalence of
   HBV and HCV virus in HIV-infected subjects in the Gambia.
   Methods: Plasma samples from HIV infected patients (190 individuals with
   clinically defined AIDS and 382 individuals without AIDS) were tested
   retrospectively for the presence of HBV sero-markers and for serum HBV
   DNA, screened for HCV infection by testing for anti-HCV antibody and HCV
   RNA.
   Results: HBsAg prevalence in HIV-positive individuals is 12.2\%. HIV/HBV
   co-infected individuals with CD4 count of < 200 cells uL-1 have a higher
   HBV DNA viral load than patients with higher CD4 count (log 4.0 vs. log
   2.0 DNA copies/ml, p < 0.05). Males (OR = 1.8, 95\% CI: 1.0, 3.2) were
   more likely to be HBsAg positive than female. HCV seroprevalence was
   0.9\% in HIV-positive individuals.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of HBsAg carriage in HIV-infected Gambians is
   similar to that obtained in the general population. However co-infected
   individuals with reduced CD4 levels, indicative of AIDS had higher
   prevalence of HBeAg retention and elevated HBV DNA levels compared to
   non-AIDS patients with higher CD4 count.}},

Abstract = {{The beta-herpesvirus CMV induces a substantial and progressive expansion
   of virus-specific memory CD8 T cells, which protect the host against
   viral reactivation from latency. In this paper, we report that this
   expansion, or ``inflation,{''} of memory T cells is amplified
   dramatically during mouse CMV infection of IL-10 knockout (IL-10(-/-))
   mice. T cells from IL-10(-/-) mice were oligoclonal, exhibited a highly
   activated phenotype, expressed antiviral cytokines, and degranulated in
   response to cognate Ag encounter ex vivo. Moreover, latent viral load
   was reduced in IL-10(-/-) mice. Importantly, these results were
   recapitulated by IL-10R blockade during chronic/latent infection of
   wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that regulatory immune mechanisms
   can influence CMV-specific T cell memory and suggest a possible
   rationale for the acquisition of functional IL-10 orthologs by
   herpesviruses. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185: 3583-3592.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{408}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{4368-4375}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents research that answers three main questions: (1) Do
   preconceptions held about the constituent materials of an environmental
   noise barrier affect how people perceive the barrier will perform at
   attenuating noise? (2) Does aesthetic preference influence the
   perception of how a barrier will perform? (3) Are barriers, which are
   deemed more aesthetically pleasing, more likely to be perceived as
   better noise attenuators? In a virtual reality setting with film to
   improve the contextual realism of the intersensory interaction test,
   participants were required to compare the perceived effectiveness of
   five standard `in-situ' noise barriers, including concrete, timber,
   metal, transparent acrylic and a vegetative screen. The audio stimulus
   was held at a constant sound pressure level (SPL), whilst the visual
   stimulus changed, as the influential factor. As the noise levels
   projected during the study were held constant, it was possible to
   attribute the participants' perception of noise attenuation by the
   barriers, to preconceptions of how the varying barrier material would
   attenuate noise. There was also an inverse correlation between
   aesthetics and perception of how a noise barrier would perform. The
   transparent and deciduous vegetation barriers, judged most aesthetically
   pleasing, were judged as the least effective at attenuating noise. (c)

Abstract = {{The role of primary visual cortex (area V1) in subjective perception has
   intrigued students of vision for decades. Specifically, the extent to
   which the activity of different types of cells (monocular versus
   binocular) and electrophysiological signals (i.e., local field
   potentials versus spiking activity) reflect perception is still debated.
   To address these questions we recorded from area V1 of the macaque using
   tetrodes during the paradigm of binocular flash suppression, where
   incongruent images presented dichoptically compete for perceptual
   dominance. We found that the activity of a minority (20\%) of neurons
   reflect the perceived visual stimulus and these cells exhibited
   perceptual modulations substantially weaker compared with their sensory
   modulation induced by congruent stimuli. Importantly, perceptual
   modulations were found equally often for monocular and binocular cells,
   demonstrating that perceptual competition in V1 involves mechanisms
   across both types of neurons. The power of the local field potential
   (LFP) also showed moderate perceptual modulations with similar
   percentages of sites showing significant effects across frequency bands
   (18-22\%). The possibility remains that perception may be strongly
   reflected in more elaborate aspects of activity in V1 circuits (e.g.,
   specific neuronal subtypes) or perceptual states might have a modulatory
   role on more intricate aspects of V1 firing patterns (e.g.,
   synchronization), not necessarily altering the firing rates of single
   cells or the LFP power dramatically.}},

Abstract = {{LixAg1-x(Nb0.5Ta0.5)O-3 (0 <= x <= 0.25) solid solutions have been
   fabricated by the mixed oxide method. Compositions with x <= 0.15 were
   single phase perovskite by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and could be indexed
   using the end member, Ag(Nb0.5Ta0.5)O-3 Pbcm cell, root 2a, root 2a, 4a
   (where a is the pseudocubic lattice parameter). For x >= 0.20, Li(Nb,
   Ta)O-3 peaks emerged as a second phase. Electron diffraction patterns
   from the perovskite phase could also be indexed according to the Pbcm
   cell but there was a systematic decrease in the intensity of \{00
   1/4\}(p) as Li concentration increased which indicated that the
   correlation length of cation displacements perpendicular to c decreased
   from long to short range order. The reduction in correlation length of
   cation displacements resulted in a convergence of the M-1-M-2-M-3
   transitions to give a single broad, frequency dependent maximum at
   x=0.15. Further increase in Li concentration did not qualitatively
   affect the temperature dependent dielectric data, consistent with the
   solubility limit determined by XRD. P-E loops did not show any
   significant enhancement in switchable polarization in the system with
   the majority of samples exhibiting a linear dielectric response. (C)

   The CrAlBN thin films had a multilayered structure in which the

   hardness of the films increased as the AlB cathode arc current was
   raised from 35 to 45 A. and then decreased with further increase of the
   current. The hardness of the films increased rapidly with the increase
   of the bias voltage from -50 to -150 V. Further increase in the bias
   voltage decreased the hardness. The maximum hardness of 48 GPa was
   obtained at the bias voltage of -150 V. With the increase of bias
   voltage, a good correlation between the residual stress and the hardness
   of the films was observed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on effects of protection with a silicone resin to
   develop a fiber-optic oxygen sensor with long-term stability and
   durability in harsh underground environments. Ruthenium (II) complexes
   were used as oxygen-sensing compounds. A uniform composite film composed
   of silicone resin and the Ru complex was prepared with spin coating
   technique. A comparison of dissolved-oxygen (DO) sensitivity between the
   composite film and a Ru complex film was made by exposing to hot water
   (80 C). The result of the accelerated degradation test showed that
   sensitivity of the Ru complex film was stable; meanwhile that of the
   composite film increased with exposure time in a short period. In order
   to improve stability, the Ru complex film overcoated with silicone resin
   was prepared. Differences in sensitivity for saturated DO (8.5 ppm)
   between with and without the silicone resin overcoating on the Ru
   complex film were investigated by exposing to the hot water and
   simulated underground water. These results revealed that the
   sensitivities and response times of the overcoated films were stable and
   slow, respectively, compared to those of non-overcoated films. Then,
   optodes were evaluated for effects of the overcoating on sensing
   properties by exposing to 100 vol.\% oxygen gas. The experiment showed
   that: (1) the response time was significantly influenced by the
   thickness of the overcoating; and (2) response speed of the overcoated
   optode was slow by a factor of about 35 compared to that of the
   non-overcoated. We concluded that the overcoating was effective in the
   application to mid- and long-term oxygen monitoring in the harsh
   environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Most hepatitis delta virus (HDV) prevalence estimates from
   the United States are 110 years old, and HDV has shown significant
   temporal variation in other populations. HDV-hepatitis B virus (HBV)
   dual infection progresses rapidly, has more complications, and has a
   different treatment regimen than HBV infection alone. Accurate estimates
   of prevalence and risk factors are important to help clinicians decide
   who to screen.
   Methods. Injection drug users in Baltimore, Maryland, who were positive
   for HBV serologic markers were tested for hepatitis delta antibody
   (HDAb) at 2 time periods: 1988-1989 (194 participants) and 2005-2006
   (258 participants). Those who were HDAb positive in 2005-2006, plus a
   random sample of HDAb negative, HBV-positive participants were tested
   for HDV RNA, HBV DNA, and HCV RNA. Characteristics associated with HDV
   exposure and viremia were identified.
   Results. HDV prevalence declined from 15\% in 1988-1989 to 11\% in
   2005-2006. Among those with chronic HBV infection, prevalence increased
   from 29\% (14 of 48 participants) to 50\% (19 of 38 participants)
   (P=.05). Visiting a ``shooting gallery{''} (a location where people
   gather to inject illegal drugs) was a strong correlate of HDAb
   positivity (relative risk, 3.08; P=.01). Eight (32\%) of those who were
   HDAb positive had HDV viremia. Viremic participants had elevated liver
   enzyme levels and more emergency room visits.
   Conclusions. The temporal increase in HDV prevalence among those with
   chronic HBV infection is troubling; understanding this change should be
   a priority to prevent the burden from increasing.}},

Abstract = {{Water stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta D) are useful tools to depict
   and to understand the atmospheric water cycle. In tropical regions, they
   record the variations of convective activity and their implementation in
   convection schemes brings constraints on our understanding and
   parameterization of this phenomena. Here, we present for the first time
   measurements of a new isotopic marker of the hydrological cycle
   (O-17(excess) resulting from the combination of delta O-17 and delta
   O-18 of water) in convective regions on two different time scales: (i)
   during the African monsoon onset and intra-seasonal variability
   (Banizoumbou, 2006) and (ii) during the squall line of the 11th of
   August 2006 (Niamey). O-17(excess) responds to the monsoon onset by a
   similar to 30 per meg increase as well as to different convective
   processes in squall lines by similar to 20 per meg variations. These
   variations parallel those of d-excess at first order and display
   significant correlation with relative humidity in the lower troposphere.
   Still, higher correlation coefficients are observed between d-excess and
   relative humidity than between O-17(excess) and relative humidity,
   suggesting a higher influence of relative humidity on d-excess than on
   O-17(excess). Using a simple reevaporation model and a more
   sophisticated 2D model of a squall line, we show that reevaporation is
   the process explaining the increase of d-excess and O-17(excess) with
   relative humidity for these two studies. We also show that the
   combination of O-17(excess) and d-excess is a powerful tool to constrain
   the representation of isotopic processes during rain reevaporation. In
   turn, a good representation of such processes enables to use water
   isotopes to evaluate convective parameterization in atmospheric models.

Abstract = {{A new simple characterization method was employed to investigate the
   formation of carbon deposits in reduced Co/Y zeolites. The method was
   based on temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) between adsorbed
   carbon deposits and hydrogen. Together with other characterization
   methods of FMR, TEM and H-2 chemisorption, CO hydrogenation reaction was
   performed on Co/Y zeolite catalysts, and the changes in CO hydrogenation
   activity and selectivity with metal distributions were also
   investigated. Especially the studies have discussions about the
   selectivity pattern of cobalt clusters within Y-zeolite cages and large
   cobalt metal aggregates on the external surface of the zeolites.
   The catalyst having most of cobalt metal clusters inside the zeolite
   cages showed much more selective synthesis of C-3 and C-4 products than
   the other catalysts. It is suggested that the lower hydrogenating
   ability induced the enhanced chain propagation and the chain growth was
   terminated by the surface sites of cobalt clusters. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections can lead to chronic
   hepatitis in immunocompromised patients. We have investigated the risk
   factors for HEV infection among solid-organ transplant recipients and
   the characteristics of these infections.
   Methods. We performed serological tests, quantified the virus, and
   genotyped the virus in plasma samples. We performed a case-control study
   with HEV-infected patients and control participants matched for sex and
   age who were recruited from a population of solid-organ transplant
   recipients with no markers of HEV infection.
   Results. We investigated 38 consecutive cases of HEV genotype 3
   infection. Twenty-two (58\%) of these 38 patients developed a chronic
   infection. The acute-phase aminotransferase levels were higher in the
   patients who cleared the virus than in those who developed chronic
   infections. The anti-HEV immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M profiles
   and HEV RNA concentration in patients who cleared the virus were similar
   to those in patients who developed a chronic infection. A logistic
   regression analysis of 37 case patients and 148 control participants
   indicated that the only factor independently associated with HEV
   infection was the consumption of game meat (68\% of case patients vs
   47\% of control participants; odds ratio, 2.32; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.04-5.15).
   Conclusion. Immunocompromised patients should avoid eating
   insufficiently cooked game meat or pork products so as to reduce the
   risk of HEV infection and chronic liver disease.}},

Abstract = {{We report here investigation into the genetic basis of mouse hepatitis
   virus strain 1 (MHV-1) pneumovirulence. Sequencing of the 3' one-third
   of the MHV-1 genome demonstrated that the genetic organization of MHV-1
   was similar to that of other strains of MHV. The hemagglutinin esterase
   (HE) protein was truncated, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
   studies confirmed previous work that suggested that the MHV-1 HE is a
   pseudogene. Targeted recombination was used to select chimeric viruses
   containing either the MHV-1 S gene or genes encoding all of the MHV-1
   structural proteins, on an MHV-A59 background. Challenge studies in mice
   demonstrated that expression of the MHV-1 S gene within the MHV-A59
   background (rA59/SMHV-1) increased the pneumovirulence of MHV-A59, and
   mice infected with this recombinant virus developed pulmonary lesions
   that were similar to those observed with MHV-1, although rA59/SMHV-1 was
   significantly less virulent. Chimeras containing all of the MHV-1
   structural genes on an MHV-A59 background were able to reproduce the
   severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like pathology observed with
   MHV-1 and reproducibly increased pneumovirulence relative to
   rA59/SMHV-1, but were still much less virulent than MHV-1. These data
   suggest that important determinants of pneumopathogenicity are contained
   within the 3' one-third of the MHV-1 genome, but additional important
   virulence factors must be encoded in the genome upstream of the S gene.
   The severity of the pulmonary lesions observed correlates better with
   elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines than with viral replication in
   the lungs, suggesting that pulmonary disease has an important
   immunological component.}},

   Implementations on energy efficient windows have been discussed for

   too small. Here we show by calculations based on effective medium theory
   that dilute composites with VO2 nanoparticles embedded in hosts with

Title = {{Soluble L1CAM promotes breast cancer cell adhesion and migration in
   vitro, but not invasion}},
Journal = {{CANCER CELL INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neural recognition molecule L1CAM, which is a key protein
   involved in early nervous system development, is known to be abnormally
   expressed and shed in several types of cancers where it participates in
   metastasis and progression. The distinction of L1CAM presence in
   cancerous vs. normal tissues has suggested it to be a new target for
   cancer treatment. Our current study focused on the potential role of
   soluble L1CAM in breast cancer cell adhesion to extracellular matrix
   proteins, migration, and invasion.
   Results: We found L1 expression levels were correlated with breast
   cancer stage of progression in established data sets of clinical
   samples, and also were high in more metastatic breast cancer cell lines
   MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, but low in less migratory MDA-MB-468 cells.
   Proteolysis of L1 into its soluble form ( sL1) was detected in cell
   culture medium from all three above cell lines, and can be induced by
   PMA activation. Over-expression of the L1 ectodomain in MDA-MB-468 cells
   by using a lentiviral vector greatly increased the amount of sL1
   released by those cells. Concomitantly, cell adhesion to extracellular
   matrix and cell transmigration ability were significantly promoted,
   while cell invasion ability through Matrigel (TM) remained unaffected.
   On the other hand, attenuating L1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells by
   using a shRNA lentiviral vector resulted in reduced cell-matrix adhesion
   and transmigration. Similar effects were also shown by monoclonal
   antibody blocking of the L1 extracellular region. Moreover, sL1 in
   conditioned cell culture medium induced a directional migration of
   MDA-MB-468 cells, which could be neutralized by antibody treatment.
   Conclusions: Our data provides new evidence for the function of L1CAM
   and its soluble form in promoting cancer cell adhesion to ECM and cell
   migration. Thus, L1CAM is validated further to be a potential early
   diagnostic marker in breast cancer progression and a target for breast
   cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen is a clean and new energy carrier to generate power through the
   Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system. Hydrogen can be
   effectively turned out through the catalytic gasification of organic
   material such as automotive shredder residues (ASR). The main objective
   of this manuscript is to present an analysis of the catalytic
   gasification of ASR for the generation of high-purity hydrogen in a
   lab-scale fixed-bed downdraft gasifier using 15 wt.\% NiO/Al2O3
   catalysts at 760-900 K. In the catalytic gasification process, reduction
   of Ni(II) catalyst into Ni(0) has been confirmed through XANES spectra
   and consequently EXAFS data shows that the central Ni atoms have Ni-O
   and Ni-Ni bonds with bond distances of 2.03 +/- 0.05 and 2.46 +/- 0.05
   A, respectively. ASR is partially oxidized and ultimately converts into
   hydrogen rich syngas (CO and H-2) and increases of the reaction
   temperature are favored the generation of hydrogen with decomposition of
   the CO. As well, approximately 220 kg h(-1) of ASR would be
   catalytically gasified at 760-900 K and 46.2 atm with the reactor volume
   0.27 m(3) to obtain approximately 3.42 x 10(5) kcal h(-1) of thermal
   energy during over 87\% syngas generation with the generation of 100 kW

   of a periodic Watt-type predator-prey system where the prey disperses in

Abstract = {{This paper employs the theory of planar dynamical systems and
   undetermined coefficient method to study travelling wave solutions of
   the dissipative (2 + 1)-dimensional AKNS equation. By qualitative
   analysis, global phase portraits of the dynamic system corresponding to
   the equation are obtained under different parameter conditions.
   Furthermore, the relations between the properties of travelling wave
   solutions and the dissipation coefficient r of the equation are
   investigated. In addition, the possible bell profile solitary wave
   solution, kink profile solitary wave solutions and approximate damped
   oscillatory solutions of the equation are obtained by using undetermined
   coefficient method. Error estimates indicate that the approximate
   solutions are meaningful. Based on above studies, a main contribution in
   this paper is to reveal the dissipation effect on travelling wave
   solutions of the dissipative (2 + 1)-dimensional AKNS equation. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The relationship between the cellular Ca2+ signal and secretory vesicle
   fusion (exocytosis) is a key determinant of the regulation of the
   kinetics and magnitude of the secretory response. Here, we have
   investigated secretion in cells where the exocytic response is
   controlled by Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Using
   live-cell two-photon microscopy that simultaneously records Ca2+ signals
   and exocytic responses, we provide evidence that secretion is controlled
   by changes in Ca2+ concentration {[}Ca2+] in relatively large-volume
   microdomains. Our evidence includes: (1) long latencies (>2 seconds)
   between the rise in {[}Ca2+] and exocytosis, (2) observation of
   exocytosis all along the lumen and not clustered around Ca2+ release
   hot-spots, (3) high affinity (K-d=1.75 mu M) Ca2+ dependence of
   exocytosis, (4) significant reduction in exocytosis in the prescence of
   cytosolic EGTA, (5) spatial exclusion of secretory granules from the
   cell membrane by the endoplasmic reticulum, and (6) inability of local
   Ca2+ responses to trigger exocytosis. These results strongly indicate
   that the control of exocytosis, triggered by Ca2+ release from stores,
   is through the regulation of cytosolic {[}Ca2+] within a microdomain.}},

Abstract = {{A novel electrochemical sensing system for direct electrochemistry-based
   hydrogen peroxide biosensor was developed that relied on the virtues of
   excellent biocompatibility, conductivity and high sensitivity to the
   local perturbations of single-layer graphene nanoplatelet (SLGnP). To
   demonstrate the concept, the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme was
   selected as a model to form the SLGnP-TPA (tetrasodium
   1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic acid)-HRP composite film. The single-layer
   graphene composite film displayed a pair of well-defined and good
   reversible cyclic voltammetric peak for Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple of
   HRP, reflecting the enhancement for the direct electron transfer between
   the enzyme and the electrode surface. Analysis using electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that electrostatic attractions
   existed between graphene monolayers and enzyme molecules. The intimate
   graphene and enzyme interaction was also observed using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), which resulted in the special properties of
   the composite film. Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) indicated
   the enzyme in the composite film retained its secondary structure
   similar to the native state. The composite film demonstrated excellent
   electrochemical responses for the electrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2), thus suggesting its great potential applications in
   direct electrochemistry-based biosensors. Crown Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This manuscript describes the pervaporation study of benzene
   (Bz)/cyclohexane (Chx) mixture through four new semifluorinated
   poly(ether amide) (PEA) membranes. The polymers were prepared by
   phosphorylation polyamidation reaction of isophthalic acid (IA) and four
   structurally different semifluorinated diamine monomers (BTAPPI,
   BTAPPHI, BTAPPF, BTAPPPI). The synthesized polymers were characterized
   by elemental analyses, FT-IR. H-1 and C-13 NMR, TGA, DSC, DMA, WAXD and
   Rheology study. The polymers showed very good thermal stability
   associated with high glass transition temperatures (230-290 degrees C),
   good mechanical strength and preferential solubility in organic
   solvents. The membranes of these polymers showed higher permeation flux
   with comparable pervaporation selectivity in comparison to many other
   polymers reported earlier. An attempt has been taken to draw a structure
   property correlation of the chemical structures of the polymers with
   their pervaporation performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Effect of Availability Bias and Reflective Reasoning on Diagnostic
   Accuracy Among Internal Medicine Residents}},
Journal = {{JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION}},

Abstract = {{Context Diagnostic errors have been associated with bias in clinical
   reasoning. Empirical evidence on the cognitive mechanisms underlying
   biases and effectiveness of educational strategies to counteract them is
   lacking.
   Objectives To investigate whether recent experience with clinical
   problems provokes availability bias (overestimation of the likelihood of
   a diagnosis based on the ease with which it comes to mind) resulting in
   diagnostic errors and whether reflection (structured reanalysis of the
   case findings) counteracts this bias.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Experimental study conducted in 2009
   at the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, with 18 first-year and 18
   second-year internal medicine residents. Participants first evaluated
   diagnoses of 6 clinical cases (phase 1). Subsequently, they diagnosed 8
   different cases through nonanalytical reasoning, 4 of which had findings
   similar to previously evaluated cases but different diagnoses (phase 2).
   These 4 cases were subsequently diagnosed again through reflective
   reasoning (phase 3).
   Main Outcome Measures Mean diagnostic accuracy scores (perfect score,
   4.0) on cases solved with or without previous exposure to similar
   problems through nonanalytical (phase 2) or reflective (phase 3)
   reasoning and frequency that a potentially biased (ie, phase 1)
   diagnosis was given.
   Results There were no main effects, but there was a significant
   interaction effect between ``years of training{''} and ``recent
   experiences with similar problems.{''} Results consistent with an
   availability bias occurred for the second-year residents, who scored
   lower on the cases similar to those previously encountered (1.55; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 1.15-1.96) than on the other cases (2.19;
   95\% CI, 1.73-2.66; P=.03). This pattern was not seen among the
   first-year residents (2.03; 95\% CI, 1.55-2.51 vs 1.42; 95\% CI,
   0.92-1.92; P=.046). Second-year residents provided the phase 1 diagnosis
   more frequently for phase 2 cases they had previously encountered than
   for those they had not (mean frequency per resident, 1.44; 95\% CI,
   0.93-1.96 vs 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.28-1.17; P=.04). A significant main effect
   of reasoning mode was found: reflection improved the diagnoses of the
   similar cases compared with nonanalytical reasoning for the second-year
   residents (2.03; 95\% CI, 1.49-2.57) and the first-year residents (2.31;
   95\% CI, 1.89-2.73; P=.006).
   Conclusion When faced with cases similar to previous ones and using
   nonanalytic reasoning, second-year residents made errors consistent with
   the availability bias. Subsequent application of diagnostic reflection
   tended to counter this bias; it improved diagnostic accuracy in both
   first-and second-year residents. JAMA. 2010;304(11):1198-1203

Abstract = {{Silicone glue (modified silicone polymer) is widely used for both
   experiments involving inorganic crystal growth and those involving
   organic materials like proteins. This material is very useful for
   building a hand-made experiment setup or for fixing protein crystals to
   specific locations. Though silicone glue is regarded as harmful to
   proteins, no systematic verification was performed to investigate its
   impurity effects on protein crystal growth. We focused on and estimated
   the impurity effects of silicone glue on protein crystal growth.
   Hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) was used as a model protein. Surface
   morphology and step velocity of tetragonal lysozyme crystals in the
   presence and absence of silicone glue were investigated by laser
   confocal interference contrast microscopy (LCM-DIM). The surface
   morphology of a tetragonal lysozyme crystal in the presence of silicone
   glue corresponded to that grown in a lysozyme solution without silicone
   glue. The dependency of step velocities on supersaturation in the
   presence of silicone glue also exhibited the same tendency as that of a
   glue-free system. These two phenomena indicate that the silicone glue
   did not act as an impurity on lysozyme crystals. Therefore, we conclude
   that silicone glue is an effective material for various unique
   experiments involving protein crystals or for applying new methods to
   create large, high-quality protein crystals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Strawberry is a candidate crop for space that is rich in protective
   antioxidants and could also have psychological benefits as a component
   of crew diets during long-duration space habitation. Energy for electric
   lighting is a major input to a controlled-environment crop-production
   system for space habitation. Day-neutral strawberry cultivars were
   evaluated at several different photoperiods to determine minimum
   lighting requirements without limiting yield or negatively impacting
   fruit quality. The cultivars `Tribute', `Seascape', and `Fern' were
   grown at 14, 17, or 2011 of light per day, and fruit yield was evaluated
   over a 31-week production period. This amounted to a difference of 2418
   kWh m(-2) in energy usage between the longest and shortest photoperiods.
   All cultivars produced similar total fresh weight of fruit regardless of
   photoperiod. Volunteer tasters rated organoleptic characteristics
   including sweetness, tartness, texture, and overall appeal as measures
   of fruit quality. Generally, organoleptic attributes were not affected
   by photoperiod, but these attributes were somewhat dependent upon
   cultivar and harvest time. Cultivars under different photoperiods varied
   in their production of fruit over time. `Seascape' was the most
   consistent producer, typically with the largest, most palatable fruit.
   `Seascape' plants subsequently were grown at 10-, 12-, or 14-h
   photoperiods over a treatment period of 33 weeks. Photoperiod again had
   no significant effect on total fruit weight, although there were
   periodic flushes of productivity. Fruit under all photoperiods had
   acceptable approval ratings. A large-fruited, day-neutral strawberry
   cultivar such as `Seascape' remains productive under shortened
   photoperiods, allowing reductions in energy and crew labor while
   maintaining flexibility for mixed-cropping scenarios in space. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A novel electrode geometry is proposed in which a disk microelectrode is
   recessed below a second electrode which covers an entire plane.
   Potential step experiments on such plane-recessed disk electrodes and
   arrays of these electrodes are considered. The recessed disks act as a
   generator and a plane electrode above acts as a collector.
   Electrochemical reactions at the generator electrode are assumed to be
   followed by chemical reaction. Both first order (EC1) and second order
   (EC2) mechanisms are considered. Current transients are found to be
   sensitive to the diffusion coefficient of both the reduced and oxidised
   species as well as to the rate of the chemical reaction and its
   mechanism. The rate constant of the chemical reaction can be measured
   over a range of six orders of magnitude. The rate of the second order
   chemical reaction can be measured up to the limit of diffusion
   controlled reaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many nonwoven fabrics are made by melt spinning semicrystalline fibers
   followed by thermal bonding using heated calendar rolls. In this work,
   we have studied thermal bonding of polypropylene films to simulate
   bonding of nonwoven fibers. We have tried to relate the thermal bond
   strengths with the concepts of chain dynamics via interfacial adhesion
   development at symmetric polymer interfaces. This requires relating the
   microscopic dynamics of chains with macroscopic interfacial adhesion
   measurements. It was found that the interfacial bond strength was
   proportional to the fraction of the crystals melted. This required
   heating the interfacial region between the polymer layers into the
   melting region. Bond strengths were also related to process time as
   t(1/2). This dependence is consistent with the literature for reptation,
   but is also due to the required thermal diffusion to bring the
   interfacial region to the bonding temperature. Finally, the bond
   strength is also dependent on the polymer molecular weight as 1/M-1/2,
   which is consistent with forming the bonds via chain reptation, provided
   that the bonding time is less than the reptation time. (C) 2010 Wiley

Abstract = {{Stroke is a complex disease caused by combination of multiple risk
   factors. Recent findings have suggested that stroke has a significant
   genetic component. Various types of genetic polymorphisms have been
   suggested to contribute to the risk of stroke. Gene polymorphisms of
   renin-angiontensin aldosterone system (RAAS) have been suggested to be
   risk factors for hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and stroke. In
   the present case-control study we investigated the association of
   -344C/T (rs179998) polymorphism in the promoter region of the human
   aldosterone (CYP11B2) gene with genetic predisposition to hypertension,
   ischemic stroke and stroke subtypes classified according to TOAST (Trial
   of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification. Four hundred and
   three stroke patients (hypertensives:normotensives = 219:184) and three
   hundred and ninety four, sex and age matched healthy controls
   (hypertensives:normotensives = 118:276) were involved in the study. The
   region of interest in the CYP11B2 gene was amplified by polymerase chain
   reaction and genotypes determined by subjecting the PCR products to
   restriction digestion by the enzyme Radii. Significant difference was
   observed in the genotypic distribution and allelic frequency between the
   stroke patients and healthy controls. TT genotype and T allele
   associated significantly with hypertension and stroke (p<0.000 in
   hypertension and p=0.000 in case of stroke). A stepwise logistic
   regression analysis confirmed these findings. To establish that this
   polymorphism is associated with stroke independent of hypertension, we
   compared stroke patients without hypertension with normotensive
   controls. Significant difference was observed in genotypic distribution
   and allelic frequency between the two groups (p=0.000). Further
   evaluating the association of this polymorphism with stroke subtypes we
   found significant associations with intracranial large artery
   atherosclerosis, lacunar stroke and cardioembolic stroke (p=0.000 in
   each case). In conclusion our study suggests that -344T allele of
   CYP11B2 gene is an important risk factor for hypertension and ischemic
   stroke. However, this is a preliminary study and the results need to be
   confirmed in a larger cohort. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of ion irradiation on nanoscale hardness of
   ZnO microcones is reported. The hardness of ZnO cones determined by
   nanoindentation using atomic force microscope initially increases from
   4.7 +/- 1.4 to 9.5 +/- 1.6 GPa after irradiation with 1.2 MeV Ar(+8)
   ions at an ion fluence of 10(15) ions cm(-2) and then decreases with
   increasing ion fluence. This change in mechanical hardness has been
   correlated with the residual stress of the sample revealed by Raman peak
   shift in the E(2)(H) mode. These results show that the generally
   reported radiation-hard nature of ZnO depends critically on irradiation
   conditions, especially the irradiation temperature. (c) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Shell weights of Globigerinoides sacculifer and the elemental
   concentration of magnesium and calcium (Mg/Ca) from Globigerinoides
   ruber measured from an Arabian Sea sediment core, AAS9/21, exhibit an
   inverse relationship with each other, which reveals that shell weights
   are mainly controlled by surface water {[}COT] rather than calcification
   temperature. Down core shell weight variations of Core AAS9/21 show an
   excellent correspondence with CO2 concentrations in an Antarctic Ice
   Core, which reveals that planktic forminifera shells can trace
   atmospheric CO2 due to the resultant change in surface water {[}CO3=].
   Hence, shell weights of G. sacculifer can be used as a proxy to
   reconstruct atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the past. Here, based on
   the shell weights, surface water {[}CO3=] change in the Arabian Sea is
   quantified and found that a {[}CO3=] variation of similar to 8 mu mol/kg
   occurred during the Holocene and a similar to 36 mu mol/kg variation

   real-time dynamic changes in the tissue NO and O-2 contents. At the
   onset of electrical stimulation, there was an immediate decrease in the
   cortical tissue O-2 followed by a subsequent increase in the cortical
   tissue NO content. The averages of the maximum normalized concentration
   changes induced by the stimulation were a 0.41 (+/- 0.04)-fold decrease
   in the O-2 and a 3.6 (+/- 0.9)-fold increase in the NO concentrations
   when compared with the corresponding normalized basal levels. The peak
   increase in NO was always preceded by the peak decrease in O-2 in all
   animals (11 = 11). The delay between the maximum decrease in 02 and the
   maximum increase in NO varied from 3.1 to 54.8 s. This rather wide
   variation in the temporal associations was presumably attributed to the
   sparse distribution of NOS-containing neurons and the individual
   animal's differences in brain vasculatures, which suggests that a sensor
   with fine spatial resolution is needed to measure the location-specific
   real-time NO and O-2 contents. In summary, the developed NO/O-2 dual
   microsensor is effective for measuring the NO and O-2 contents in vivo.
   This study provides direct support for the dynamic role of NO in
   regulating the cerebral hemodynamics, particularly related to the tissue
   oxygenation.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the single and joint acute toxicity of diuron and
   two of its metabolites (DCPMU and 3,4-DCA) on natural phototrophic
   biofilms using a PICT approach with photosynthesis bioassays. River
   biofilm communities were collected at three sampling stations exhibiting
   increasing concentrations of diuron, DCPMU and 3,4-DCA from upstream to
   downstream. Applied individually, the parent compound was more toxic
   than its metabolites, with DCPMU being more toxic than 3,4-DCA which
   only inhibited photosynthesis at very high concentrations (EC25 at about
   5 mg/I). Sensitivity of biofilm communities to diuron and DCPMU
   decreased from upstream to downstream, revealing tolerance induction in
   contaminated sections of the river, as expected from the PICT concept.
   Nevertheless, PICT was not applicable for 3,4-DCA, which similarly
   affected upstream, intermediate and downstream biofilm communities.
   Chemical mixtures of diuron and DCPMU demonstrated additive effects
   whereas combinations with 3,4-DCA enhanced the observed effects.
   Our results reveal that the individual and combined presence of diuron
   and DCPMU in lotic ecosystems can have both short-term effects (as shown
   with bioassays) and long-term effects (as shown through the PICT
   approach) on phototrophic biofilms, whereas environmental concentrations
   of 3,4-DCA may not affect biofilm photosynthetic activity. (C) 2010

Title = {{End-of-life discontinuation of destination therapy with cardiac and
   ventilatory support medical devices: physician-assisted death or
   allowing the patient to die?}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL ETHICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bioethics and law distinguish between the practices of
   ``physician-assisted death{''} and ``allowing the patient to die.{''}
   Discussion: Advances in biotechnology have allowed medical devices to be
   used as destination therapy that are designed for the permanent support
   of cardiac function and/or respiration after irreversible loss of these
   spontaneous vital functions. For permanent support of cardiac function,
   single ventricle or biventricular mechanical assist devices and total
   artificial hearts are implanted in the body. Mechanical ventilators
   extrinsic to the body are used for permanent support of respiration.
   Clinical studies have shown that destination therapy with ventricular
   assist devices improves patient survival compared to medical management,
   but at the cost of a substantial alteration in end-of-life trajectories.
   The moral and legal assessment of the appropriateness and permissibility
   of complying with a patient's request to electively discontinue
   destination therapy in a life-terminating act in non-futile situations
   has generated controversy. Some argue that complying with this request
   is ethically justified because patients have the right to request
   withdrawal of unwanted treatment and be allowed to die of preexisting
   disease. Other commentators reject the argument that acceding to an
   elective request for death by discontinuing destination therapy is
   `allowing a patient to die' because of serious flaws in interpreting the
   intention, causation, and moral responsibility of the ensuing death.
   Summary: Destination therapy with cardiac and/or ventilatory medical
   devices replaces native physiological functions and successfully treats
   a preexisting disease. We posit that discontinuing cardiac and/or
   ventilatory support at the request of a patient or surrogate can be
   viewed as allowing the patient to die if-and only if-concurrent lethal
   pathophysiological conditions are present that are unrelated to those
   functions already supported by medical devices in destination therapy.
   In all other cases, compliance with a patient's request constitutes
   physician-assisted death because of the pathophysiology induced by the
   turning off of these medical devices, as well as the intention,
   causation, and moral responsibility of the ensuing death. The
   distinction between allowing the patient to die and physician-assisted
   death is pivotal to the moral and legal status of elective requests for
   death by discontinuing destination cardiac and/or ventilatory medical
   devices in patients who are not imminently dying. This distinction also
   represents essential information that must be disclosed to patients and
   surrogates in advance of consent to this type of therapy.}},

Abstract = {{In the adult mammalian CNS, the growth inhibitors oligodendrocyte-myelin
   glycoprotein (OMgp) and the reticulon RTN4 (Nogo) are broadly expressed
   in oligodendrocytes and neurons. Nogo and OMgp complex with the neuronal
   cell surface receptors Nogo receptor-1 (NgR1) and paired Ig-like
   receptor-B (PirB) to regulate neuronal morphology. In the healthy CNS,
   NgR1 regulates dendritic spine shape and attenuates activity-driven
   synaptic plasticity at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. Here, we
   examine whether Nogo and OMgp influence functional synaptic plasticity,
   the efficacy by which synaptic transmission occurs. In acute hippocampal
   slices of adult mice, Nogo-66 and OMgp suppress NMDA receptor-dependent
   long-term potentiation (LTP) when locally applied to Schaffer
   collateral-CA1 synapses. Neither Nogo-66 nor OMgp influences basal
   synaptic transmission or paired-pulse facilitation, a form of short-term
   synaptic plasticity. PirB(-/-) and NgR1(-/-) single mutants and
   NgR1(-/-); PirB(-/-) double mutants show normal LTP, indistinguishable
   from wild-type controls. In juvenile mice, LTD in NgR1(-/-), but not
   PirB(-/-), slices is absent. Mechanistic studies revealed that Nogo-66
   and OMgp suppress LTP in an NgR1-dependent manner. OMgp inhibits LTP in
   part through PirB but independently of p75. This suggests that NgR1 and
   PirB participate in ligand-dependent inhibition of synaptic plasticity.
   Loss of NgR1 leads to increased phosphorylation of extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), signaling intermediates known to
   regulate neuronal growth and synaptic function. In primary cortical
   neurons, BDNF elicited phosphorylation of AKT and p70S6 kinase is
   attenuated in the presence of myelin inhibitors. Collectively, we
   provide evidence that mechanisms of neuronal growth inhibition and
   inhibition of synaptic strength are related. Thus, myelin inhibitors and
   their receptors may coordinate structural and functional neuronal
   plasticity in CNS health and disease.}},

Abstract = {{Lipins are phosphatidic acid phosphatases with a pivotal role in
   regulation of triglyceride and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Lipin1 is
   also an amplifier of PGC-1 alpha, a nuclear coactivator of PPAR-alpha
   responsive gene transcription. Lipins do not contain recognized
   membrane-association domains, but interaction of these enzymes with
   cellular membranes is necessary for access to their phospholipid
   substrate. We identified a role for a conserved polybasic amino acid
   motif in an N-terminal domain previously implicated as a determinant of
   nuclear localization in selective binding of lipin1 beta to phosphatidic
   acid, using blot overlay assays and model bilayer membranes. Studies
   using lipin1 beta polybasic motif variants establish that this region is
   also critical for nuclear import and raise the possibility that
   nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of lipin1 beta is regulated by PA. We used
   pharmacological agents and lipin1 beta polybasic motif mutants to
   explore the role of PA-mediated membrane association and nuclear
   localization on lipin1 beta function in phospholipid metabolism and
   adipogenic differentiation. We identify a role for the lipin1 polybasic
   motif as both a lipid binding motif and a primary nuclear localization
   sequence. These two functions are necessary for full expression of the
   biological activity of the protein in intracellular lipid metabolism and
   transcriptional control of adipogenesis.}},

Title = {{Joint determination of K-40 decay constants and Ar-40{*}/K-40 for the

   geochronology}},

Abstract = {{Ar-40/Ar-39 and K-Ar geochronology have long suffered from large
   systematic errors arising from imprecise K and Ar isotopic data for
   standards and imprecisely determined decay constants for the branched
   decay of K-40 by electron capture and beta-emission. This study presents
   a statistical optimization approach allowing constraints from K-40
   activity data, K-Ar isotopic data, and pairs of U-238-Pb-206 and a
   Ar-40/Ar-39 data for rigorously selected rocks to be used as inputs for
   estimating the partial decay constants (lambda(epsilon), and
   lambda(beta)) of K-40 and the Ar-40{*}/K-40 ratio (kappa(FCs)) of the
   widely used Fish Canyon sanidine (FCs) standard. This yields values of
   kappa(FCs) = (1.6418 +/- 0.0045) x 10(-3),lambda(epsilon) = (0.5755 +/-
   0.0016) x 10(-10) a(-1) and lambda(beta) = (4.9737 +/- 0.0093) x 10(-10)
   a(-1). These results improve uncertainties in the decay constants by a
   factor of >4 relative to values derived from activity data alone.
   Uncertainties in these variables determined by our approach are
   moderately to highly correlated (cov(kappa(FCs), lambda(epsilon)) =
   7.1889 x 10(-19), cov(kappa(FCs,) lambda(beta)) = -7.1390 x 10(-19)
   cov(lambda(epsilon), lambda(beta)) = -3.4497 x 10(-26)) and one must
   take account of the covariances in error propagation by either linear or
   Monte Carlo methods. 40Ar/39Ar age errors estimated from these results
   are significantly reduced relative to previous calibrations. Also, age
   errors are smaller for a comparable level of isotopic measurement
   precision than those produced by the U-238/Pb-206 system, because the
   Ar-40/Ar-39 system is now jointly calibrated by both the K-40 and U-238
   decay constants, and because lambda(epsilon)(K-40) < lambda(U-238).
   Based on this new calibration, the age of the widely used Fish Canyon
   sanidine standard is 28.305 +/- 0.036 Ma. The increased accuracy of
   Ar-40/Ar-39 ages is now adequate to provide meaningful validation of
   high-precision U/Pb or astronomical tuning ages in cases where closed
   system behavior of K and Ar can be established. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Discharge was calculated from a mountainous area, including discharge
   from glaciers, in the Qilian Shan (Qilian Mountains) of northwest China.
   The studied Yingluoxia basin is 9983 km(2) in area, with glaciers making
   up 0.3\% of the basin. The calculation method was based on the heat
   balance, requiring only daily temperature and precipitation. Calculated
   annual discharge from the basin corresponded well with the observed
   data. Calculated annual discharge from glaciers was 3.6\% of the total
   discharge from the basin.
   The temporal trend of the calculated equilibrium line altitude (ELA) at
   the July 1st Glacier (western side of the Yingluoxia basin) was similar
   to that of the observed ELA. The calculated annual mass balance of
   glaciers within the Yingluoxia basin has a larger negative value than
   the other glaciers in China, as the ratio of accumulation area to the
   total glacier area in the Yingluoxia basin is much lower than in
   neighbouring basins to the west. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to use a microfluidic sperm sorter
   (MFSS), designed to isolate motile human spermatozoa with laminar flows
   (no centrifugation), for porcine IVF. Boar spermatozoa were diluted at 1
   x 10(8) with a diluent containing 20\% seminal fluid and flowed with
   modified TCM-199 (mM199, with 5 mM caffeine) to introduce motile sperm
   into the exit chamber for IVF. In Experiment 1, after flowing for 5 min,
   sperm concentration varied significantly among specific sites within the
   MFSS collecting chamber (range, 0.8 +/- 0.5 x 10(4) to 575.0 +/- 56.3 x
   10(4) cells/mL; mean +/- SEM). In Experiment 2, when porcine IVM oocytes
   were placed at three locations in the MFSS exit chamber (where only
   motile spermatozoa accumulated) and subsequently cultured in
   caffeine-free mM199 for 8 h, sperm penetration rate was not
   significantly different among places (86.1 +/- 10.5 to 100\%), but the
   monospermic penetration rate was lower (P < 0.05) in oocytes 3.5 mm from
   the exit position (12.5 +/- 4.8\%) than those at 7.5 mm (53.1 +/- 6.0\%)
   or further (41.9 +/- 2.8\%) from the exit. In Experiment 3, the normal
   fertilization index (ratio of monospermic oocytes to number of oocytes
   examined) 8 h after insemination was higher (P < 0.05) in the MFSS-IVF
   system (0.375 +/- 0.040) than both standard IVF and transient IVF (0.222
   +/- 0.028 and 0.189 +/- 0.027, respectively, with co-culture for 8 h and
   for 5 min). Developmental competence of fertilized oocytes (blastocyst
   formation) was higher (P < 0.05) in the MFSS-IVF system (40.9 +/- 2.3\%)
   than in either standard or transient IVF (22.6 +/- 1.4 and 33.7 +/-
   3.5\%). In conclusion, brief co-culture of porcine oocytes with
   spermatozoa gradually accumulated in the MFSS chamber improved the
   efficiency of producing monospermic fertilized embryos and blastocysts.
   Furthermore, efficiencies were significantly affected by oocyte location
   within the chamber. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new simple, sensitive and precise liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry method has been developed and validated for the
   determination of valacyclovir-HCl and acyclovir in tsetse flies
   (Glossina pallipides). Tsetse flies were extracted by ultrasonication
   with acidified methanol/acetonitrile, centrifuged and cleaned up by
   solid phase dispersion using MgSO(4) and MSPD C(18) material. Samples
   were analysed using a Waters Alliance 2695 series HPLC with a C18 Gemini
   analytical column (150 mm x 4.6 mm x 5 mu m) and a guard cartridge
   column connected to a Waters Quattro-Micro triple-quadrupole mass
   spectrometer. The isocratic mobile phase consisted of
   methanol:acetonitrile:water (60:30:10, v/v/v) plus formic acid (0.1\%)
   at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The precursor > product ion transition
   for valacyclovir (m/z 325.1 >152) and acyclovir (m/z 226.1 > 151.9) were
   monitored in positive electrospray multiple reaction monitoring mode.
   The method was validated at fortification levels of 0.5, 1 and 2 mu g/g.
   The range of calibration for both drugs was 0.45-4.5 mu g/g. The overall
   accuracy of the method was 92\% for valacyclovir and 95\% for acyclovir
   with corresponding within-laboratory reproducibilities of 4.4 and 3.4\%,
   respectively. Mean recoveries were above 80\% for both drugs and
   repeatability ranged from 0.7 to 6.1\%. For both drugs the limits of
   detection and quantification were 0.0625 and 0.2 mu g/g, respectively.
   The method was applied in experiments on the mass rearing of tsetse
   flies for sterile insect technique (SIT) applications, in which the
   flies were fed with blood meals containing acyclovir or valcyclovir-HCl
   prior to analysis to assess effects on Glossina pallidipes Salivary

Abstract = {{Deactivation of acidic zeolite catalysts during methanol conversion is
   investigated for elucidating how spatial constraints interfere
   mechanistically. Detailed product composition - including retained
   organic matter - is determined in a time resolved mode.
   At 270-300 degrees C with H-ZSM-5, first unsaturated hydrocarbons are
   formed-methane being the indicative co-product. Then the reaction rate
   increases auto-catalytically, but soon declines because of exhaustive
   pore filling. The retained organic matter consists mainly of
   ethyl-trimethyl-benzene-and isopropyl-dimethyl-benzene molecules.
   Alkylation of benzene rings with ethene and propene produces the
   deactivating molecules.
   At 475 degrees C, alkylation of benzene rings with olefins has shifted
   to the reverse, reactivating the H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Coke forms slowly on
   the surface of H-ZSM-5 crystallites. Spatial constraints suppress the
   formation of 2-ring aromatics. With the wide pore zeolite H-Y, fast
   deactivation is noticed-bigger aromatic molecules can be formed and are
   retained.
   Methanol reactions on the protonic catalyst sites are visualized as CH3+
   attack for methylation and dehydrogenation, methane being the
   hydrogen-rich co-product. Methanol conversion on zeolites H-ZSM-58,
   H-EU-1 and H-Beta is comparatively investigated.
   Zone ageing is discussed for favorable reactor design.
   It is shown, how a multi-compound product composition is the source of
   information for elucidating complex reaction mechanisms. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The external part of the eye shares mucosa-associated common
   characteristics and is an obvious entry site for foreign Ags. We
   assessed the potential of eyedrop vaccination for effective delivery of
   vaccines against viral or bacterial infection in mice. Both OVA-specific
   IgG Ab in serum and IgA Ab in mucosal compartments were induced by
   eyedrops of OVA with cholera toxin (CT). Eyedrop vaccination of
   influenza A/PR/8 virus (H1N1) induced both influenza virus-specific
   systemic and mucosal Ab responses and protected mice completely against
   respiratory infection with influenza A/PR/8 virus. In addition, eyedrop
   vaccination of attenuated Salmonella vaccine strains induced
   LPS-specific Ab and complete protection against oral challenge of
   virulent Salmonella. Unlike with the intranasal route, eyedrop
   vaccinations did not redirect administered Ag into the CNS in the
   presence of CT. When mice were vaccinated by eyedrop, even after the
   occlusion of tear drainage from eye to nose, Ag-specific systemic IgG
   and mucosal IgA Abs could be induced effectively. Of note, eyedrops with
   OVA plus CT induced organogenesis of conjunctiva-associated lymphoid
   tissue and increased microfold cell-like cells on the
   conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue in the nictitating membrane on
   conjunctiva, the mucosal side of the external eye. On the basis of these
   findings, we propose that the eyedrop route is an alternative to mucosal
   routes for administering vaccines. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185:

Abstract = {{B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), like its relative programmed cell
   death-1 (PD-1), is a receptor that negatively regulates murine T cell
   activation. However, its expression and function on human T cells is
   currently unknown. We report in this study on the expression of BTLA in
   human T cell subsets as well as its regulation on virus-specific T cells
   during primary human CMV infection. BTLA is expressed on human CD4(+) T
   cells during different stages of differentiation, whereas on CD8(+) T
   cells, it is found on naive T cells and is progressively downregulated
   in memory and differentiated effector-type cells. During primary CMV
   infection, BTLA was highly induced on CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells
   immediately following their differentiation from naive cells. After
   control of CMV infection, BTLA expression went down on memory CD8(+)
   cells. Engagement of BTLA by mAbs blocked CD3/CD28-mediated T cell
   proliferation and Th1 and Th2 cytokine secretion. Finally, in vitro
   blockade of the BTLA pathway augmented, as efficient as anti-PD-1 mAbs,
   allogeneic as well as CMV-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation. Thus,
   our results suggest that, like PD-1, BTLA provides a potential target
   for enhancing the functional capacity of CTLs in viral infections. The

Abstract = {{The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) links the extracellular matrix
   and actin cytoskeleton. Caveolae form membrane arrays on smooth muscle
   cells; we investigated the mechanism for this organization. Caveolin-1
   and beta-dystroglycan, the core transmembrane DGC subunit, colocalize in
   airway smooth muscle. Immunoprecipitation revealed the association of
   caveolin-1 with beta-dystroglycan. Disruption of actin filaments
   disordered caveolae arrays, reduced association of beta-dystroglycan and
   caveolin-1 to lipid rafts, and suppressed the sensitivity and
   responsiveness of methacholine-induced intracellular Ca2+ release. We
   generated novel human airway smooth muscle cell lines expressing shRNA
   to stably silence beta-dystroglycan expression. In these myocytes,
   caveolae arrays were disorganized, caveolae structural proteins
   caveolin-1 and PTRF/cavin were displaced, the signaling proteins PLC. 1
   and G(alpha q), which are required for receptor-mediated Ca2+ release,
   were absent from caveolae, and the sensitivity and responsiveness of
   methacholine-induced intracellular Ca2+ release, was diminished. These
   data reveal an interaction between caveolin-1 and beta-dystroglycan and
   demonstrate that this association, in concert with anchorage to the
   actin cytoskeleton, underpins the spatial organization and functional
   role of caveolae in receptor-mediated Ca2+ release, which is an
   essential initiator step in smooth muscle contraction.}},

Abstract = {{Guar gum is a naturally occurring galactomannan, which is extremely
   hydrophilic in nature. Hydroxypropyl guar gum (HPG) was subjected to
   acetylation using acetic anhydride and pyridine. The effect of the
   reduction in the hydrophilic nature of the polymer on its filler
   properties was studied by using the derivatized guar gum as filler in an
   unsaturated polyester composite. The effect of degree of substitution
   and the concentration of filler on the rheological, chemical, and
   mechanical properties of the composites were studied. Results indicated
   that an increase in the acetate content in the HPG resulted in an
   increased polymer filler interaction. However, the composites resulting
   from these derivatized HPGs showed reduced mechanical properties. This
   decrease in the mechanical properties were attributed to the decrease in
   the hydrogen bonding in the filler particles, thus reducing the
   cohesiveness and strength of the filler particles themselves. Thus,
   polysaccharides can be used as fillers but chemically modifying them
   results in a change in the basic nature of the filler itself and is not
   just restricted to surface modification as is the case of inorganic
   fillers and fibers. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci

Abstract = {{The controlled formation of aragonite by simple method under ambient
   condition is a big challenge for biomaterial scientists. In this
   article, we took poly (N-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) as an example to
   investigate the influence of water-soluble nonionic polymers on the
   polymorphs of CaCO3 via CO2 diffusion method under ambient pressure and
   temperature, and found that the existence of PVP molecules favors the
   formation of aragonite with rosette superstructure. A possible mechanism
   is proposed that nonionic polymers can be doped into amorphous calcium
   carbonate (ACC) particles and further participate in the transformation
   process from ACC to aragonite and then promotes the formation of rosette
   superstructure through parallel aggregation by cross-linking the
   aragonite nuclei. The experiments of CaCO3 crystallization in presence
   of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) confirmed
   the mechanism. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 117:

Abstract = {{The vaccinia virus (VACV) entry-fusion complex (EFC) is composed of at

   genes induced corresponding protein-binding antibody but failed to
   protect against VACV intranasal challenge and only DNA encoding A28
   elicited low neutralizing antibody. Because the A28 and H2 proteins
   interact, we determined the effect of immunizing with both genes
   simultaneously This procedure greatly enhanced the amount of antibody
   that bound intact virions, neutralized infectivity, and provided partial
   protection against respiratory challenge Neither injection of A28 and H2
   plasmids at different sites or mixing A28 and H2 sera enhanced
   neutralizing antibody The neutralizing antibody could be completely
   removed by binding to the A28 protein alone and the epitope was located
   in the C-terminal segment These data suggest that the interaction of H2

Title = {{Chromogenic in situ hybridization to detect EGFR gene copy number in
   cell blocks from fine-needle aspirates of non small cell lung carcinomas
   and lung metastases from colo-rectal cancer}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL \& CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Several studies demonstrated that epidermal growth factor
   receptor (EGFR) gene copy number (GCN) correlates to the response to
   tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to
   anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) in metastatic colorectal cancer
   (CRC). In the presence of lung nodules, cytology is often the only
   possible diagnostic approach. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH)
   is an alternative technique to fluorescence in situ hybridization
   (FISH), but its feasibility in detecting EGFR GCN in cell blocks from
   fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of lung nodules has not yet been
   established.
   Methods: We evaluated the feasibility of CISH on 33 FNAC from 20 primary
   NSCLC (5 squamous carcinomas, 8 large cell carcinomas and 7
   adenocarcinomas) and 13 lung metastases from CRC.
   Results: Of the 33 FNAC analyzed by CISH, 27 (82\%) presented a balanced
   increase in EGFR gene and chromosome 7 number: 10 cases (30\%) showed a
   low polysomy, 15 (45\%) a high polysomy and 2 (6\%) NSCLC were
   amplified. No significant differences between NSCLC and CRC lung
   metastases were found in relation to disomic or polysomic status. In
   addition, no correlation between EGFR GCN and EGFR immunohistochemical
   overexpression was found. Furthermore, we compared CISH results with
   those obtained by FISH on the same samples and we found 97\% overall
   agreement between the two assays (k = 0.78, p < 0.0001). Two cases were
   amplified with both assays, whereas 1 case of NSCLC was amplified by
   FISH only. CISH sensitivity was 67\%, the specificity and positive
   predictive value (PPV) was 100\%, and the negative predictive value
   (NPV) was 97\%.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that CISH is a valid method to detect EGFR
   GCN in cell blocks from FNAC of primary NSCLC or metastatic CRC to the
   lung.}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal which causes concern as an environmental
   toxicant. Therapy with chelating agents is considered to be the rational
   treatment against metal poisoning. This study was designed to evaluate
   whether meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) could alleviate
   oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in mice with subchronic
   exposure to Cd. Male ICR mice received CdCl2 (100 mg/L) via drinking
   water for 8 weeks. After Cd exposure, DMSA at a dose of 25 mg/kg or 50
   mg/kg was intragastrically administered once daily for 5 consecutive
   days at the end of Cd treatment. It was found that Cd-induced
   hypertension and markedly blunted vascular responses to vasoactive
   agents, including acetylcholine, phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside.
   Treatment with DMSA significantly restored blood pressure and improved
   vascular responsiveness when compared with Cd-treated controls.
   Moreover, DMSA protected against Cd-induced severe oxidative stress by
   normalization of the redox ratios of glutathione to glutathione
   disulfide and suppression of plasma malondialdehyde, plasma protein
   carbonyl, urinary nitrate/nitrite, and superoxide production from
   thoracic aorta. DMSA partially reduced Cd contents in the blood, heart,
   liver and kidneys. In conclusion, our present study provides the first
   evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of DMSA against oxidative stress
   and vascular dysfunction in Cd-intoxicated mice. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Lithium vanadium oxide has been synthesized as an anode material for

   prepared by spray pyrolysis is sintered at 1000 degrees C under 10\%

   Highly crystallized hexagonal lithium vanadate, Li1 + x VO2, is obtained
   without any impurities. The product has mean particle size of 7-8 mu m.
   Lattice parameters of as-prepared powders vary largely according to Li/V
   ratio. The powder having the lowest c/a ratio shows the largest
   discharge capacity. Optimum x value is 0.2 in the view point of the
   discharge capacity (294 mAh g(-1)) and the cycle retention (>90\%, after
   25 cycles).
   Structural change of as-prepared lithium vanadate is investigated by ex
   situ X-ray diffraction analysis on charged electrodes at various state
   of charge (SOC). Lithium vanadate undergoes two step phase transition
   during charging process and its main peak gets broader as the charge
   state gets higher. This peak broadening is explained by the breaking
   down of particles at high SOC. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{National parks in western Canada experience midland fire events at
   differing frequencies, intensities, and burn seventies These episodic
   disturbances have varying implications for various biotic and abiotic
   processes and patterns To predict burn severity, the differenced
   Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) algorithm, derived from Landsat imagery,
   has been used extensively throughout the midland fire community. In
   Canada, few accuracy assessments have been undertaken to compare the
   accuracy of the dNBR algorithm to its relative form (RdNBR). To
   investigate the accuracies of these two algorithms in Canada's National
   Parks, we hypothesized that RdNBR would outperform dNBR in two specific
   applications based on former research by Miller and Thode (2007) The
   first was the capacity of the RdNBR to produce more accurate results
   than dNBR over a wide range of fires and secondly in pre-fire landscapes
   with low canopy closure and high heterogeneity. To investigate these
   questions, dNBR and RdNBR indices were extracted from Landsat imagery
   and compared to the measurements of the Composite Burn Index (Key \&
   Benson, 2006). Following this, best fit models were developed and
   statistically tested at the individual, regional, overall, and
   vegetative levels We then developed confusion matrices to assess the
   relative strength and weakness of each model. As an additional means of
   comparing model accuracy, we tested Hall et al `s (2008) non-linear
   model in estimating burn severity for the study's western boreal region
   and individual fires The results indicate that across all fires, the
   RdNBR-derived model did not estimate burn severity more accurately than
   dNBR (65.2\% versus 70.2\% classification accuracy, respectively) nor in
   the heterogeneous and low canopy cover landscapes. In addition, we
   conclude that RdNBR is no more effective than dNBR at the regional,
   individual, and fine-scale vegetation levels. The Hall et al. (2008)
   model was found to estimate burn severity in the western boreal region
   with a higher overall kappa than both the dNBR and RdNBR study models
   The results herein support the continued research and pursuit of
   developing regional remote sensing derived models in western Canada. (C)

Title = {{Low Profile Pelvic Fixation With the Sacral Alar Iliac Technique in the
   Pediatric Population Improves Results at Two-Year Minimum Follow-up}},
Journal = {{SPINE}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Retrospective review.
   Objective. Anchor stability and prominence are problems with pelvic
   fixation in pediatric spinal deformity surgery. We compared the new
   sacral alar iliac (SAI) fixation technique (with a starting point in the
   sacral ala and inline anchors deep under the midline muscle flap) with
   other methods of screw fixation.
   Summary of Background Data. Iliac anchors have been shown to provide the
   best form of pelvic fixation. A trajectory from the posterior sacral
   surface to the iliac wings has recently been described. To our
   knowledge, no clinical series has compared this method of pelvic
   fixation in children to others.
   Methods. Of 32 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent SAI
   fixation, 2 died and 26 returned for follow-up (>2 years). Mean age at
   surgery was 14 years. Average screw size was 67 mm long and 7 to 9 mm in
   diameter. Clinical examinations, radiographs, and computed tomography
   scans were analyzed. Outcomes included pain over the implants, screw
   placement, implant prominence, radiographic lucency, need for revision,
   and infection. SAI patients were compared with 27 previous patients who
   had pelvic fixation via other screw techniques.
   Results. For SAI fixation, correction of pelvic obliquity and Cobb
   angles were 20 degrees +/- 11 degrees (70\%) and 42 degrees +/- 25
   degrees (67\%), respectively. For other pelvic fixation methods, those
   values were 10 degrees +/- 9 degrees (50\%), and 46 degrees +/- 16
   degrees (60\%), respectively. Compared with other screws, SAI screws
   provided significantly better pelvic obliquity correction (P = 0.002)
   but no difference in Cobb correction. There were 2 lucencies adjacent to
   screws in both groups. Computed tomography scans of 18 SAI patients
   showed no intrapelvic protrusion, but 1 screw extended laterally (<5
   mm). One early SAI patient required revision with larger screws, which
   relieved pain; there was 1 revision in the comparison group. SAI
   patients had no deep infections, implant prominence, late skin
   breakdown, or anchor migration; traditional patients had 3 deep
   infections (P = 0.09) and 3 instances of implant prominence, skin
   breakdown, or anchor migration.
   Conclusion. SAI pelvic fixation produces better correction of pelvic
   obliquity than do previous techniques. Radiographic and clinical anchor
   stability is satisfactory at 2-year follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Previously we have developed a prototype for conditionally replicating
   oncolytic influenza A virus which is based on deletions in the
   non-structural (NS1) protein. Multi-cycle replication of influenza A
   virus in malignant tissue is critically dependent on a protease which
   cleaves the viral entry protein. Here we demonstrate that the malignant
   colon cancer cell lines Caco-2, HT-29 and SW-620 can endogenously
   provide a virus-activating protease, which allows lytic multi-cycle
   replication of NS1 deletion viruses in those cancer cells in vitro. The
   oncolytic potency of an influenza NS1 deletion virus (NS1-80) was
   further tested in SCID mice bearing HT-29 derived tumors. The
   intra-tumoral injection of live, but not of heat inactivated NS1-80
   virus significantly inhibited progression of established tumors. We
   conclude that a selected set of human cancer expressing virus
   activating-proteases will be a preferred target for oncolytic tumor
   therapy using influenza A virus mutants.}},

Abstract = {{A series of Co (0-6 wt\%)-promoted 15 wt\% Mo and 9 wt\% K catalysts was
   prepared using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as support. These
   catalysts were extensively characterized in oxide and sulfide phases and
   tested for higher alcohol synthesis reaction from CO hydrogenation
   (molar ratio of H-2 to CO is equal to 1). The diffraction peaks that
   represent the characteristic K-Mo-S phase were observed in the X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) patterns of sulfided Co-promoted Mo-K/MWCNTs
   catalysts. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
   (DRIFTS) of adsorbed CO revealed that Co addition to Mo-K/MWCNTs
   catalyst not only increases the number of surface Mo sites, but also
   promotes the reducibility of Mo. The total alcohol space time yield
   (STY) reached a maximum at 0.207 g/(g of catalyst)/h on the catalyst
   promoted with 6 wt\% Co, whereas the catalyst with 4.5 wt\% Co exhibited
   selectivities of 14\% and 23\% towards ethyl alcohol and higher
   alcohols, respectively, at 320 degrees C and 8.27 MPa. The best
   conditions for producing higher alcohols from synthesis gas (mole ratio
   of H-2 and CO is equal to 1) using gas hourly space velocity of 3.6 m(3)
   (STP)/h/kg of catalyst are determined as 330 degrees C and 9.65 MPa. (c)

Abstract = {{Contaminants from various sources including medical devices, laboratory
   materials and the environment, and analytical apparatus may contribute
   to their endogenous congeners at different stages of the analytical
   process. Here, an approach is reported for the identification and
   quantification of contaminating analytes in biological fluids by
   stable-isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and
   gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) methods. This
   approach is based on the analysis of different sample volumes and
   determination of the peak area ratio (PAR) of the endogenous analyte to
   the stable-isotope labeled analogue serving as the internal standard.
   The PAR is obtained by selected-ion monitoring or selected-reaction
   monitoring of appropriate ions. Generation of PAR values that correlate
   inversely with the sample volume subjected to analysis reveals the
   existence of contamination. The extent of contamination is obtained by
   plotting the PAR of endogenous analyte to internal standard versus the
   reciprocal of the sample volume analyzed. Examples are given for
   uncontaminated and contaminated endogenous analytes in biological
   samples, including nitrite and nitrate analyzed by GC/MS, and the fatty
   acid metabolites oleic acid oxide, oleic acid ethanol amide, and
   arachidonic acid ethanol amide analyzed by GC/MS/MS. Dependence of the
   PAR of endogenous analyte to its internal standard upon derivatization
   time reveals a unique kind of contamination that: was identified in the
   GC/MS analysis of nitrate in plasma as pentafluorobenzyl ester. This
   kind of contamination occurs at the latest stage of GC/MS analysis and
   cannot be controlled by reference to the internal standard.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a novel technique involving knitting and electrospinning to
   fabricate a composite scaffold for ligament tissue engineering. Knitted
   structures were coated with poly(L-lactic-co-e-caprolactone) (PLCL) and
   then placed onto a rotating cylinder and a PLCL solution was electrospun
   onto the structure. Highly aligned 2-mu m-diameter microfibers covered
   the space between the stitches and adhered to the knitted scaffolds. The
   stress-strain tensile curves exhibited an initial toe region similar to
   the tensile behavior of ligaments. Composite scaffolds had an elastic
   modulus (150 +/- 14 MPa) similar to the modulus of human ligaments.
   Biological evaluation showed that cells proliferated on the composite
   scaffolds and they spontaneously orientated along the direction of
   microfiber alignment. The microfiber architecture also induced a high
   level of extracellular matrix secretion, which was characterized by
   immunostaining. We found that cells produced collagen type I and type
   III, two main components found in ligaments. After 14 days of culture,
   collagen type III started to form a fibrous network. We fabricated a
   composite scaffold having the mechanical properties of the knitted
   structure and the morphological properties of the aligned microfibers.
   It is difficult to seed a highly macroporous structure with cells,
   however the technique we developed enabled an easy cell seeding due to
   presence of the microfiber layer. Therefore, these scaffolds presented
   attractive properties for a future use in bioreactors for ligament
   tissue engineering. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res

Abstract = {{Transforming growth factors-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), -2, and -3 form a small
   group of related proteins involved in the regulation of proliferation,
   differentiation, and survival of various cell types. Recently, TGF-beta
   s were also demonstrated to be neuroprotective. In the present study, we
   investigated their distribution in the rat brain as well as their
   expression following middle cerebral artery occlusion. Probes were
   produced for all types of TGF-beta s, and in situ hybridization was
   performed. We demonstrated high TGF-beta 1 expression in cerebral
   cortex, hippocampus, central amygdaloid nucleus, medial preoptic area,
   hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, substantia nigra, brainstem
   reticular formation and motoneurons, and area postrema. In contrast,
   TGF-beta 2 was abundantly expressed in deep cortical layers, dentate
   gyrus, midline thalamic nuclei, posterior hypothalamic area and
   mamillary body, superior olive, areas of monoaminergic neurons, spinal
   trigeminal nucleus, dorsal vagal complex, cerebellum, and choroid
   plexus, and a high level of TGF-beta 3 mRNA was found in cerebral
   cortex, hippocampus, basal amygdaloid nuclei, lateral septal nucleus,
   several thalamic nuclei, arcuate and supramamillary nuclei, superior
   colliculus, superior olive, brainstem reticular formation and
   motoneurons, area postrema, and inferior olive. Focal brain ischemia
   induced TGF-beta s with markedly different expression patterns. TGF-beta
   1 was induced in the penumbral region of cortex and striatum, whereas
   TGF-beta 2 and -beta 3 were induced in different layers of the
   ipsilateral cortex. The expression of the subtypes of TGF-beta s in
   different brain regions suggests that they are involved in the
   regulation of different neurons and bind to different latent TGF-beta
   binding proteins. Furthermore, they might have subtype-specific
   functions following ischemic attack. J. Comp. Neurol. 518:3752-3770,

Abstract = {{Diamond and gold powders were compressed nonhydrostatically in a diamond
   anvil cell and examined by x-ray diffraction using a radial geometry to
   evaluate the evolution of stresses and strains in these materials to

   across diamond and gold grains under uniaxial compression. The observed
   mean pressure of diamond powder reached to 360(40) GPa while it was only
   31(1) GPa for the polycrystalline gold under the highest load.
   Polycrystalline diamond can support a microscopic deviatoric stress of
   160(18) GPa at about 360 GPa. Due to the deformation of the diamond
   anvil culet, the macroscopic differential stress of the diamond sample
   was limited to about 43(8) GPa. There is no evidence that the diamond

   mg/L Ni2+, the ability to remove organic pollutants was recovered; but
   the ability to remove ammonia was not. The addition of Ni2+ made a great
   change in the quantity and composition of the EPS in bulking sludge,
   including both exterior soluble EPS (EPSs) and interior bound EPS
   (EPSb), showing a slight increase followed by a large decrease before
   reaching a steady state. The difference between the change in the
   amounts of EPSs and EPSb was not significant. However, among the
   component fractions, the change in protein content was obvious than that
   of polysaccharide and humic acid. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{High level G3(MP2B3) calculations have been performed to study the
   structures and properties of {[}n]silaprismanes and
   poly{[}n]silaprismanes. The similarity and differences of these
   molecules were systematically studied in terms of their structures,
   binding energy, strain energy, heat of formation, and HOMO-LUMO gaps,
   etc. Our calculations reveal that the five-membered silaprismane (n = 5)
   have relatively high stability among the {[}n]silaprismanes studied.
   Considering that only the three- (n = 3) and four-membered (n = 4)
   silaprismane derivatives have been synthesized up to now, our
   calculations provide an interesting target for future synthesis. In
   addition, we designed a series of multi-layer silaprismane whose
   HOMO-LUMO gaps decrease with the number of layers. It is then expected
   that the silicon nanotubes are semi-conductive with small HOMO-LUMO
   gaps. The comparisons between silaprismane and hydrogenated silicon
   fullerene were also made and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Multiple alterations in circadian rhythms have been observed
   in cancer patients, including the diurnal rhythm of the adrenal hormone
   cortisol. Diurnal cortisol alterations have been associated with
   cancer-related physiological processes as well as psychological stress.
   Here we investigate alterations in diurnal cortisol rhythm in ovarian
   cancer patients, and potential links with depression, life stress, and
   functional disability.
   METHODS: Women (n=177) with suspected ovarian cancer completed
   questionnaires and collected salivary cortisol 3x daily for 3
   consecutive days before surgery. One hundred women were subsequently
   diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 77 with benign disease. In addition,
   healthy women (n = 33) not scheduled for surgery collected salivary
   cortisol at the same time points.
   RESULTS: Ovarian cancer patients demonstrated significantly elevated
   nocturnal cortisol (P=.022) and diminished cortisol variability (P=.023)
   compared with women with benign disease and with healthy women (all P
   values <.0001). Among ovarian cancer patients, higher levels of
   nocturnal cortisol and less cortisol variability were significantly
   associated with greater functional disability, fatigue, and vegetative
   depression, but not with stress, distress, or depressed affect. There
   were no significant associations between functional or psychological
   variables and diurnal cortisol in women with benign disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: Nocturnal cortisol and cortisol variability show
   significant dysregulation in ovarian cancer patients, and this
   dysregulation was associated with greater functional disability,
   fatigue, and vegetative depression. These findings suggest potential
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal involvement in functional disability in
   ovarian cancer, and may have implications for disease progression.

Abstract = {{The M2MgSi2O7: Eu2+, Dy3+ (M: Sr, Ca) long afterglow phosphors are
   investigated by substituting the Ho3+ ions for the Dy3+ ions. The
   emission intensity is about 3 times and 30\% enhanced with this
   substitution in the Sr2MgSi2O7 and Ca2MgSi2O7 host, respectively. The
   emissions of the europium ions and the holmium ions are observed. Both
   emissions attribute to the 5d -> 4f transition, indicating that some of
   the Ho3+ ions are reduced to the Ho2+ ions. The Ho3+ ions or the Dy3+
   ions aggregate with the cation and the oxygen vacancies forming the
   traps. The traps induced by the clusters with Ho3+ ions are shallower
   than those induced by the clusters with Dy3+ ions. The traps'
   concentration of the Ho3+ cluster is lower. The probability of
   retrapping of the released carriers decreases with the Ho3+ ions
   co-doping. The combination effect of the shallow traps and the
   non-retrapping process gives rise to a greater intensity of the initial
   emission and a shorter duration of the afterglow. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Developmental plasticity is thought to reconcile the constraining role
   of natural selection in maintaining local adaptation with evolutionary
   diversification under novel conditions, but empirical documentations are
   rare In vertebrates, growth and development of bones is partially guided
   by contractions of attached musculature and such muscle activity changes
   progressively through embryonic development from sporadic motility to
   direct functional effects. In species with short generation times,
   delayed skull maturation extends the guiding effects of muscle activity
   on formation of foraging morphology into adulthood, providing an
   opportunity to directly examine the links between plasticity of bone
   development, ecological adaptations, and evolutionary diversification in
   foraging morphology. In this case, the morphological consequences of
   inputs due to local functional requirements should be evident in
   adaptive divergence across taxa. Here we provide evidence that
   epigenetic regulation of bone growth in Soricid shrews may enable both
   development of local adaptations and evolutionary divergence in
   mandibular morphology. We contrast the effects of muscle stimulation on
   early- vs late-maturing components of, foraging apparatus to show that
   the morphology of late-maturing components is more affected by
   functional requirements than are early-ossifying traits. Further, the
   divergence in foraging morphology across shrew species occurs along the
   directions delineated by inductive effects of muscle loading and bite
   force on bone formation in late-maturing but not early-maturing mandible
   components within species. These results support the hypothesis that
   developmental plasticity can link maintenance of local adaptations with
   evolutionary diversification in morphology. J. Exp. Zool. (Ma Dev.

Title = {{CHD7 functions in the nucleolus as a positive regulator of ribosomal RNA

Pages = {{3491-3501}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{De novo mutation of the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding
   protein 7 (CHD7) is the primary cause of CHARGE syndrome, a complex
   developmental disorder characterized by the co-occurrence of a specific
   set of birth defects. Recent studies indicate that CHD7 functions as a
   transcriptional regulator in the nucleoplasm. Here, we report based on
   immunofluorescence and western blotting of subcellular fractions that
   CHD7 is also constitutively localized to the nucleolus, the site of rRNA
   transcription. Standard chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays
   indicate that CHD7 physically associates with rDNA, a result that is
   also observable upon alignment of whole-genome CHD7 ChIP coupled with
   massively parallel DNA sequencing data to the rDNA reference sequence.
   ChIP-chop analyses demonstrate that CHD7 specifically associates with
   hypomethylated, active rDNA, suggesting a role as a positive regulator
   of rRNA synthesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, siRNA-mediated
   depletion of CHD7 results in hypermethylation of the rDNA promoter and a
   concomitant reduction of 45S pre-rRNA levels. Accordingly, cells
   overexpressing CHD7 show increased levels of 45S pre-rRNA compared with
   control cells. Depletion of CHD7 also reduced cell proliferation and
   protein synthesis. Lastly, compared with wild-type ES cells, the levels
   of 45S pre-rRNA are reduced in both Chd7(+/-) and Chd7(-/-) mouse ES
   cells, as well as in Chd7(-/-) whole mouse embryos and multiple tissues
   dissected from Chd7(+/-) embryos. Together with previously published
   studies, these results indicate that CHD7 dually functions as a
   regulator of both nucleoplasmic and nucleolar genes and provide a novel
   avenue for investigation into the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) emission spectrum of SO2 in the range
   of 270.0-470.0 nm has been obtained with the quadruple harmonic output
   (266 nm) of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser as excitation source. The spectrum is
   composed of a continuous envelope in the short wavelength side, while it
   shows the character of banded structure superimposed on a continuous one
   in the long wavelength region. Fluorescence emission from the hybrid
   states of A(1)A(2) + (BB1)-B-1 and X(1)A(1) + (BB1)-B-1 forms the
   continuous envelope and phosphorescence emission from the triplet state
   a(3)B(1) forms the banded progression. It is also found that direct
   emission from laser excited states is very weak. The primary portion of
   the emission is from the energy levels populated by collision relaxation
   or collision induced intersystem crossing process. The harmonic
   frequencies and inharmonic coefficients of the symmetric stretching
   vibration and the bending vibration of X(1)A(1) state are derived from
   the ascription of the phosphorescence progression. (c) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Using ecological network analysis, we analyzed the network structure and
   ecological relationships in an urban water metabolic system. We
   developed an ecological network model for the system, and used Beijing
   as an example of analysis based on the model. We used network
   throughflow analysis to determine the flows among components, and
   measured both indirect and direct flows. Using a network utility matrix,
   we determined the relationships and degrees of mutual ism among six
   compartments -1) local environment, 2) rainwater collection, 3)
   industry. 4) agriculture. 5) domestic sector, and 6) wastewater
   recycling - which represent producer, consumer, and reducer trophic
   levels. The capacity of producers to provide water for Beijing decreased
   from 2003 to 2007, and consumer demand for water decreased due to
   decreasing industrial and agricultural demand: the recycling capacity of
   reducers also improved, decreasing the discharge pressure on the
   environment. The ecological relationships associated with the local
   environment or the wastewater recycling sector changed little from 2003
   to 2007. From 2003 to 2005, the main changes in the ecological
   relationships among components of Beijing's water metabolic system
   mostly occurred between the local environment, the industrial and
   agricultural sectors, and the domestic sector, but by 2006 and 2007, the
   major change was between the local environment, the agricultural sector,
   and the industrial sector. The other ecological relationships did not
   change during the study period. Although Beijing's mutualism indices
   remained generally stable, the ecological relationships among
   compartments changed greatly. Our analysis revealed ways to further
   optimize this system and the relationships among compartments, thereby
   optimizing future urban water resources development. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new model with energy and computational heterogeneity

   protocol that can guarantee the reliable transmission for HWSNs is
   designed to improve the clustering scheme in low-energy adaptive
   clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and LEACH-type protocols, in which the
   cluster head selection algorithm is based on a method of energy
   dissipation forecast and clustering management (EDFCM). EDFCM considers
   the residual energy and energy consumption rate in all nodes. Simulation
   results show that EDFCM balances the energy consumption better than the
   conventional routing protocols and prolongs the lifetime of networks

Abstract = {{The effectiveness and efficiency of an ethylene/acrylate copolymer in
   toughening semicrystal-line and amorphous PLA through melt blending is
   studied. The mechanical properties, phase morphologies, miscibilities,
   and toughening mechanisms of the blends are assessed. The
   ethylene/acrylate impact modifier effectively improved the impact
   strength of the blends, regardless of the PLA type. The semicrystalline
   blends showed decreased tensile strength and modulus with increased
   impact modifier content. In contrast, the ductility, elongation at
   break, and energy to break increased significantly. The relatively low
   BDT temperature obtained for the PLA blends renders the
   ethylene/acrylate copolymer impact modifier a desirable additive to
   toughen PLA for use in cold temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Background Epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (Egfl7) is a
   chemoattractant for endothelial cells, and its expression is restricted
   to endothelial cells. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induced endothelial
   injury that occurs during transplantation contributes to the subsequent
   development of allograft vasculopathy. We investigated the effect of
   Egfl7 on endothelial cell intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression
   in response to H/R injury.
   Methods and Results-Human coronary artery endothelial cells were
   submitted to hypoxia (0.1\% O-2) followed by normoxia (21\% O-2) in the
   presence or absence of Egfl7 (100 ng/mL). Hypoxia alone increased the
   expression of Egfl7 X 140 +/- 8\% of control at 3 hours (n=6; P<0.05)
   and 385 +/- 50\% of control at 6 hours (n=6; P<0.001). Incubation with
   Egfl7 during the reoxygenation period prevented intercellular adhesion
   molecule 1 upregulation (mean fluorescence intensity: 5.37 +/- 0.92
   versus 3.81 +/- 0.21; P<0.05; n=4 per group). Nuclear factor-kappa B
   nuclear localization on H/R injury was blocked by Egfl7 administration
   (cytosolic/nuclear ratio of 0.93 +/- 0.01 versus 1.44 +/- 0.24; P<0.05;
   n=4 per group). Inhibitor of nuclear factor-KB protein level was
   significantly reduced on H/R injury (26 +/- 4.6\% of control expression;
   P<0.05; n=4 per group); however, concurrent incubation with Egfl7
   attenuated this reduction (46 +/- 6.2\% of control expression; P<0.05
   when compared with H/R injury alone; n=4 per group).
   Conclusions-Our study reveals the novel observation that hypoxia
   upregulates human coronary artery endothelial cells expression of Egfl7
   and that Egfl7 inhibits expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1
   subsequent to H/R injury. Mechanistically, Egfl7 prevented nuclear
   factor-kappa B nuclear localization and augmented inhibitor of nuclear
   factor-kappa B protein levels, suggesting that it inhibits nuclear
   factor-kappa B activation, a key step in the inflammatory activation of
   endothelial cells. Egfl7 may be protective against H/R injury incurred
   during transplantation and may modulate the events that lead to the
   development of graft vasculopathy. (Circulation. 2010;122{[}suppl

Title = {{The Crystal Structure of Toxoplasma gondii Pyruvate Kinase 1}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pyruvate kinase (PK), which catalyzes the final step in
   glycolysis converting phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, is a central
   metabolic regulator in most organisms. Consequently PK represents an
   attractive therapeutic target in cancer and human pathogens, like
   Apicomplexans. The phylum Aplicomplexa, a group of exclusively parasitic
   organisms, includes the genera Plasmodium, Cryptosporidium and
   Toxoplasma, the etiological agents of malaria, cryptosporidiosis and
   toxoplasmosis respectively. Toxoplasma gondii infection causes a mild
   illness and is a very common infection affecting nearly one third of the
   world's population.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We have determined the crystal structure
   of the PK1 enzyme from T. gondii, with the B domain in the open and
   closed conformations. We have also characterized its enzymatic activity
   and confirmed glucose-6-phosphate as its allosteric activator. This is
   the first description of a PK enzyme in a closed inactive conformation
   without any bound substrate. Comparison of the two tetrameric TgPK1
   structures indicates a reorientation of the monomers with a concomitant
   change in the buried surface among adjacent monomers. The change in the
   buried surface was associated with significant B domain movements in one
   of the interacting monomers.
   Conclusions: We hypothesize that a loop in the interface between the A
   and B domains plays an important role linking the position of the B
   domain to the buried surface among monomers through two a-helices. The
   proposed model links the catalytic cycle of the enzyme with its domain
   movements and highlights the contribution of the interface between
   adjacent subunits. In addition, an unusual ordered conformation was
   observed in one of the allosteric binding domains and it is related to a
   specific apicomplexan insertion. The sequence and structural
   particularity would explain the atypical activation by a
   mono-phosphorylated sugar. The sum of peculiarities raises this enzyme
   as an emerging target for drug discovery.}},

   feasibility}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Classical molecular dynamics have been carried out in order to study the
   proton-transfer feasibility in immobilized imidazole arrays, taking into
   account their applications in new polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
   cells. The resulting trajectories have been analyzed with respect to the
   ability of forming hydrogen bonds, considering the angle distribution
   between the proton donor and acceptor groups. The dependence of the
   hydrogen-bond network is studied with respect to the variations of
   temperature, density of imidazole groups, and spacer lengths. According
   to the results, arrays of alkyl-imidazole molecules with three mobile
   CH(2) groups are the most favorable to a proton-transfer reaction.
   Regarding the alkyl-imidazole density, no significant difference for the
   arrays with a spacing of 6 or 7 angstrom between the alkyl-imidazole
   molecules could be observed, whereas the 10 angstrom array presents a
   lower probability of a proton transfer. The optimal arrangement of the
   investigated systems is a spacing of 6 angstrom and a flexible chain
   length of three CH(2) groups. These results confirm previous
   experimental and simulation analyses. (C) 2010 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Do people spontaneously form visual mental images when understanding
   language, and if so, how truly visual are these representations? We test
   whether processing linguistic descriptions of motion produces
   sufficiently vivid mental images to cause direction-selective motion
   adaptation in the visual system (i.e., cause a motion aftereffect
   illusion). We tested for motion aftereffects (MAEs) following explicit
   motion imagery, and after processing literal or metaphorical motion
   language (without instructions to imagine). Intentionally imagining
   motion produced reliable MAEs. The aftereffect from processing motion
   language gained strength as people heard more and more of a story
   (participants heard motion stories in four installments, with a test
   after each). For the last two story installments, motion language
   produced reliable MAEs across participants. Individuals differed in how
   early in the story this effect appeared, and this difference was
   predicted by the strength of an individual's MAE from imagining motion.
   Strong imagers (participants who showed the largest MAEs from imagining
   motion) were more likely to show an MAE in the course of understanding
   motion language than were weak imagers. The results demonstrate that
   processing language can spontaneously create sufficiently vivid mental
   images to produce direction-selective adaptation in the visual system.
   The timecourse of adaptation suggests that individuals may differ in how
   efficiently they recruit visual mechanisms in the service of language
   understanding. Further, the results reveal an intriguing link between
   the vividness of mental imagery and the nature of the processes and
   representations involved in language understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Background-MicroRNAs are involved in various critical functions,
   including the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation,
   angiogenesis, and apoptosis. We hypothesize that microRNA-210 can rescue
   cardiac function after myocardial infarction by upregulation of
   angiogenesis and inhibition of cellular apoptosis in the heart.
   Methods and Results-Using microRNA microarrays, we first showed that
   microRNA-210 was highly expressed in live mouse HL-I cardiomyocytes
   compared with apoptotic cells after 48 hours of hypoxia exposure. We
   confirmed by polymerase chain reaction that microRNA-210 was robustly
   induced in these cells. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches
   were used to investigate microRNA-210 therapeutic potential in vitro.
   After transduction, microRNA-210 can upregulate several angiogenic
   factors, inhibit caspase activity, and prevent cell apoptosis compared
   with control. Afterward, adult FVB mice underwent intramyocardial
   injections with minicircle vector carrying microRNA-210 precursor,
   minicircle carrying microRNA-scramble, or sham surgery. At 8 weeks,
   echocardiography showed a significant improvement of left ventricular
   fractional shortening in the minicircle vector carrying microRNA-210
   precursor group compared with the minicircle carrying microRNA-scramble
   control. Histological analysis confirmed decreased cellular apoptosis
   and increased neovascularization. Finally, 2 potential targets of
   microRNA-210, Efna3 and Ptplb, involved in angiogenesis and apoptosis
   were confirmed through additional experimental validation.
   Conclusion-MicroRNA-210 can improve angiogenesis, inhibit apoptosis, and
   improve cardiac function in a murine model of myocardial infarction. It
   represents a potential novel therapeutic approach for treatment of
   ischemic heart disease. (Circulation. 2010;122{[}suppl 1]:S124-S131.)}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the characterization of a broad range of linear
   polyethylenes (PE) by means of thermorheology. It is demonstrated, in
   which way the thermorheological behavior can be related to the comonomer
   type and content of copolymers. In the first part of this paper,
   well-established analytical and theological methods are applied to
   distinguish linear and branched samples. The resolution limit of these
   methods is demonstrated by the investigation of a blend from a
   linear-low density PE (LLDPE) and a branched low density PE (LDPE).
   Special attention is paid to nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR)
   spectroscopy in order to reliably determine the comonomer type and
   content of the samples chosen. The main focus of this paper lies on
   thermorheological investigations and correlations with the molecular
   structure. The comparatively high sensitivity of such investigations is
   highlighted: even small amounts of long-chain branches (LCB) are
   revealed. The activation energy (E-u) of linear samples increases with
   growing comonomer length and content, respectively. As such,
   thermorheology is demonstrated to be an interesting theological
   ``tool{''} to get an insight into branching structures. Moreover, the
   experimental effort is relatively small as solely usual
   dynamic-mechanical experiments at different temperatures are required.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{We have measured the phase behavior of a binary mixture of like-charged
   colloidal spheres with a size ratio of Gamma=0.9 and a charge ratio of
   Lambda=0.96 as a function of particle number density n and composition
   p. Under exhaustively deionized conditions, the aqueous suspension forms
   solid solutions of body centered cubic structure for all compositions.
   The freezing and melting lines as a function of composition show
   opposite behavior and open a wide, spindle shaped coexistence region.
   Lacking more sophisticated treatments, we model the interaction in our
   mixtures as an effective one-component pair energy accounting for number
   weighted effective charge and screening constant. Using this
   description, we find that within experimental error the location of the
   experimental melting points meets the range of melting points predicted
   for monodisperse, one-component Yukawa systems made in several
   theoretical approaches. We further discuss that a detailed understanding
   of the exact phase diagram shape including the composition dependent
   width of the coexistence region will need an extended theoretical
   treatment. (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Virus-like particles (VLPs) of flaviviruses generated from the prM and E
   genes are a promising vaccine candidate. We have established cell clones
   continuously releasing VLPs of West Nile virus (WNV) in serum-free
   conditions. Two types of VLPs were distinguished by sedimenting analyses
   in sucrose density gradients. Fast sedimenting VLPs (F-VLPs) were large
   (40-50 nm) and composed of the E and processed mature M proteins,
   whereas slowly sedimenting vLPs (S-VLPs) were small (20-30 nm) particles
   consisting of the E and immature prM proteins. F-VLPs induced higher
   neutralizing antibody and anti-WNV IgG titers than S-VLPs. Furthermore,
   IgG2a was dominant over IgG1 by immunization with F-VLPs as with whole
   virion-derived antigens. Mice vaccinated with a low dose (3 ng) of
   F-VLPs showed higher protective efficacy (83\% survivals) against WNV
   infection than S-VLP-immune mice (17\% survivals). These results
   indicate that F-VLPs more closely resemble the virions and take a better
   immunogenic form than S-VLPs as WNV vaccine candidates. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{Background-Intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy is a widely used
   method of circulatory support. Based on frequent findings of balloon
   malposition with visceral arterial compromise on computerized
   tomographic (CT) imaging studies, we conducted a systematic review of
   cardiac surgical IABP patients with available CT scans to determine
   reasons, incidence, and clinical relevance of malposition.
   Methods and Results-From January 2007 to March 2009, a total of 621 of
   7756 cardiac surgical patients (8.0\%) received perioperative IABP
   support, of whom 63 (10.1\%) received a thoracoabdominal CT scan during
   IABP support. Proximal and distal balloon positions were analyzed. The
   anatomic distance from the left subclavian artery to celiac trunk and
   aortic transverse diameter were measured in all patients and compared
   with implanted balloon dimensions. Mean age was 67.1 +/- 11.9 years;
   33.3\% were female, and height was 169 +/- 9 cm. Based on radiography,
   proximal balloon position was correct in 96.8\% but only appropriate in
   38.1\% based on CT. In 61 of 63 patients, compromise of at least 1
   visceral artery was found: celiac trunk, 96.8\%; superior mesenteric
   artery, 87.3\%; and renal arteries, 66.7\%. Left subclavian artery to
   celiac trunk distance was 241 +/- 23 mm, and balloon length was 248 +/-
   17 mm and corresponded to an anatomic to balloon length mismatch in
   68.2\%. Spinal deformations were found in 42.9\%. Laparotomy for
   mesenteric ischemia was required in 23.8\%. Hospital mortality rate was
   60.3\%.
   Conclusions-IABP malposition was commonly identified by CT. Reasons
   included incorrect proximal balloon position as well as an
   anatomic-to-balloon length mismatch. Thus, shorter than recommended
   balloon sizes and better positioning strategies had to be considered.

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although the medical outcomes of antiretroviral therapy
   (ART) for HIV/AIDS are well described, less is known about how ART
   affects patients' economic activities and quality of life, especially
   after the first year on ART. We assessed symptom prevalence, general
   health, ability to perform normal activities, and employment status
   among adult antiretroviral therapy patients in South Africa over three
   full years following ART initiation.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A cohort of 855 adult pre-ART patients
   and patients on ART for <6 months was enrolled and interviewed an
   average of 4.4 times each during routine clinic visits for up to three
   years after treatment initiation using an instrument designed for the
   study. The probability of pain in the previous week fell from 74\%
   before ART initiation to 32\% after three years on ART, fatigue from
   66\% to 12\%, nausea from 28\% to 4\%, and skin problems from 55\% to
   10\%. The probability of not feeling well physically yesterday fell from
   46\% to 23\%. Before starting ART, 39\% of subjects reported not being
   able to perform their normal activities sometime during the previous
   week; after three years, this proportion fell to 10\%. Employment rose
   from 27\% to 42\% of the cohort. Improvement in all outcomes was
   sustained over 3 years and for some outcomes increased in the second and
   third year.
   Conclusions/Significance: Improvements in adult ART patients' symptom
   prevalence, general health, ability to perform normal activities, and
   employment status were large and were sustained through the first three
   years on treatment. These results suggest that some of the positive
   economic and social externalities anticipated as a result of large-scale
   treatment provision, such as increases in workforce participation and
   productivity and the ability of patients to carry on normal lives, may
   indeed be accruing.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Migraine has been associated with an increased risk for
   ischemic stroke and other cardiovascular (CV) events, including angina,
   myocardial infarction, and CV death, but the mechanisms that link
   migraine to CV disease remain uncertain. We hypothesized that aortic
   pulse wave velocity (PWV), a direct measure of aortic stiffness and an
   independent predictor of stroke and CV disease, may be increased in
   young migraineurs with no overt CV disease or major CV risk factors.
   Methods: We studied 60 subjects with migraine (age 33 +/- 8 years, 85\%
   women, blood pressure 119/74 +/- 11/9mmHg) and 60 age-, sex-, and blood
   pressure-matched healthy control subjects. In all participants,
   carotid-femoral PWV and aortic augmentation index were determined by
   applanation tonometry. Cases and controls were free from overt CV
   disease, diabetes, and major CV risk factors.
   Results: Subjects with migraine had a higher aortic PWV (7.6 +/- 1.2 vs
   6.4 +/- 1.1 mxs(-1), p < 0.001) and aortic augmentation (heart
   rate-adjusted augmentation index, 0.17 +/- 0.13 vs 0.08 +/- 0.15, p <
   0.001) than matched control subjects. Migraine patients with aura (n =
   17) had higher aortic PWV than those without aura (n = 43; 8.2 +/- 1.2
   vs 7.4 +/- 1.1 mxs(-1), p = 0.027). Age, mean arterial pressure as a
   measure of distending pressure, and migraine (all p < 0.05)
   independently predicted aortic PWV when a consistent number of CV risk
   factors was simultaneously controlled for.
   Conclusions: Migraine is independently associated with increased aortic
   stiffness and enhanced pressure wave reflection. This finding, obtained
   in young subjects without major CV risk factors, may represent one
   possible mechanism underlying the increased CV risk in migraine
   patients. Neurology (R) 2010;75:960-966}},

Title = {{Myosin Va Participates in Acrosomal Formation and Nuclear Morphogenesis
   during Spermatogenesis of Chinese Mitten Crab Eriocheir sinensis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis belongs to the
   Class Crustacea, Decapoda, Brachyura. The spermatozoon of this species
   is of aflagellated type, it has a spherical acrosome surrounded by the
   cup-shaped nucleus, which are unique to brachyurans. For the past
   several decades, studies on the spermatogenesis of the mitten crab
   mainly focus on the morphology. Compared with the extensive study of
   molecular mechanism of spermatogenesis in mammals, relatively less
   information is available in crustacean species. Myosin Va, a member of
   Class V myosin, has been implicated in acrosome biogenesis and vesicle
   transport during spermatogenesis in mammals. In the present study we
   demonstrate the expression and cellular localization of myosin Va during
   spermatogenesis in E. sinensis.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Western blot demonstrated that myosin Va
   is expressed during spermatogenesis. Immunocytochemical and
   ultrastructural analyses showed that myosin Va mainly localizes in the
   cytoplasm in spermatocytes. At the early stage of spermiogenesis, myosin
   Va binds to the endoplasmic reticulum vesicle (EV) and proacrosomal
   granule (PG). Subsequently, myosin Va localizes within the proacrosomal
   vesicle (PV) formed by PG and EV fusion and locates in the membrane
   complex (MC) at the mid spermatid stage. At the late spermatid stage,
   myosin Va is associated with the shaping nucleus and mitochondria. In
   mature spermatozoon, myosin Va predominates in acrosomal tubule (AT) and
   nucleus.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our study demonstrates that myosin Va may be
   involved in acrosome biogenesis and nuclear morphogenesis during
   spermatogenesis in E. sinensis. Considering the distribution and
   molecular characteristics of myosin Va, we also propose a hypothesis of
   AT formation in this species. It is the first time to uncover the role
   of myosin Va in crustacean spermatogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Bottle-brush polymers, where flexible side chains containing N=20 to 50
   effective monomers are grafted to a rigid backbone, are studied by
   molecular dynamics simulations, varying the grafting density sigma and
   the solvent quality. Whereas for poor solvents and large enough sigma
   the molecular brush is a cylindrical object, homogeneous in axial
   direction, for intermediate values of sigma an axially inhomogeneous
   structure of ``pearl-necklace{''} type is formed. The ``pearls,{''}
   however, have a strongly nonspherical ellipsoidal shape, due to the fact
   that several side chains cluster together in one pearl, qualitatively
   consistent with predictions of Sheiko et al. {[}Eur. Phys. J. E 13, 125
   (2004)] We analyze the structure of these pearls and study both the
   transition to the axially uniform cylinder at high sigma and to the
   trivial pearl-necklace structure at small sigma, where each pearl

   that the low temperature annealing does not cause polycrystallization of
   Ta2O5 but purges weakly bonded oxygen atoms from the bulk and decreases

Abstract = {{The coherent-nuclear reaction a + A -> a(star) + A is in the small-angle
   region dominated by the one-photon-exchange mechanism, often referred to
   as the Primakoff effect. In this region information about the
   electromagnetic decay a(star) -> a + gamma can be obtained. Well-known
   examples are the two-photon decays of the p and eta mesons. Also, decays
   of charged hadrons can be studied. For charged hadrons the
   one-photon-exchange amplitude comes with a Coulomb-phase factor and a
   Coulomb-form factor, which depend on the ratio between transverse-and
   longitudinal-momentum transfers, the latter being fixed. At the peak of
   the cross-section distribution, where the two momentum transfers are
   equal, the form factor could cut down the cross-section value by as much
   as 40\%. Consequently, a determination of a radiative-decay rate that
   relies on the peak value becomes sensitive to a proper treatment of the
   Coulomb-form factor.}},

Title = {{Acid-base balance and hydration status following consumption of
   mineral-based alkaline bottled water}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SPORTS NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: The present study sought to determine whether the
   consumption of a mineral-rich alkalizing (AK) bottled water could
   improve both acid-base balance and hydration status in young healthy
   adults under free-living conditions. The AK water contains a naturally
   high mineral content along with Alka-PlexLiquid, a dissolved supplement
   that increases the mineral content and gives the water an alkalizing pH
   of 10.0.
   Methods: Thirty-eight subjects were matched by gender and self-reported
   physical activity (SRPA, hrsweek) and then split into Control (12 women,
   7 men; Mean +/-SD: 23 +/- 2 yrs; 7.2 +/- 3.6 hrsweek SRPA) and
   Experimental (13 women, 6 men; 22 +/- 2 yrs; 6.4 +/- 4.0 hrsweek SRPA)
   groups. The Control group consumed non-mineralized placebo bottled water
   over a 4-week period while the Experimental group consumed the placebo
   water during the 1st and 4th weeks and the AK water during the middle
   2-week treatment period. Fingertip blood and 24-hour urine samples were
   collected three times each week for subsequent measures of blood and
   urine osmolality and pH, as well as total urine volume. Dependent
   variables were analyzed using multivariate repeated measures ANOVA with
   post-hoc focused on evaluating changes over time within Control and
   Experimental groups (alpha = 0.05).
   Results: There were no significant changes in any of the dependent
   variables for the Control group. The Experimental group, however, showed
   significant increases in both the blood and urine pH (6.23 to 7.07 and
   7.52 to 7.69, respectively), a decreased blood and increased urine
   osmolality, and a decreased urine output (2.51 to 2.05 L/day), all
   during the second week of the treatment period (P < 0.05). Further,
   these changes reversed for the Experimental group once subjects switched
   to the placebo water during the 4th week.
   Conclusions: Consumption of AK water was associated with improved
   acid-base balance (i.e., an alkalization of the blood and urine) and
   hydration status when consumed under free-living conditions. In
   contrast, subjects who consumed the placebo bottled water showed no
   changes over the same period of time. These results indicate that the
   habitual consumption of AK water may be a valuable nutritional vector
   for influencing both acid-base balance and hydration status in healthy
   adults.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate proton-production double-differential cross sections

   results are compared with the intranuclear cascade (INC) and quantum
   molecular dynamics models. Although both models can reproduce spectral
   DDXs, there is a difference at the most forward and backward angles. The
   cause of these differences is discussed in terms of the refraction
   caused by the nuclear potential. Angular distributions of the present
   data are well accounted for by the Kalbach systematics plus INC one-step
   calculations. The quasi-free-scattering contribution increases with
   decreasing target mass and increasing emission energy.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate a possibility of using the ratio between

   quantitative measure of the enhanced mesoscopic corrections to diffusive
   transport of light through a random medium with gain. We obtain an
   expression for T/E as a function of amplification strength in the
   diffusive approximation and show that it does not a have tendency to
   diverge when the threshold for random lasing is approached, as both T
   and E do. Furthermore, we find that a change in T/E signifies a change
   in the electric field distribution inside the random medium. In the
   localization regime, we also investigate the correlations between
   transmission and energy stored in the medium with and without
   amplification. Our results suggest that T/E is a promising parameter
   which can help characterize the nature of wave transport in random

Abstract = {{Spondias mangifera is a unique, fleshy, drupe fruit with a mango flavor.
   The hardening of endocarp during development and maturation of hog plum
   is a major bottleneck, which reduces the edibility of the fruits by 80\%
   and makes them unmarketable. For the first time, three distinct maturity
   stages were demonstrated. Distinct pattern in change in surface color,
   accumulation of carotene pigments and biochemical components in fruits
   were observed. The decrease in chlorophyll `a' and chlorophyll `b'
   correlated well with the downhill trend in Transmittance Refractory
   Spectroscopy (TRS) - `L', `a', `b' values. The decrease in the total
   chlorophyll along with the accumulation of carotene pigment contributes
   significantly to the lightness of surface color and reflected in `L' hue
   values. Confluence of carotene and total chlorophyll on the 9th week
   provides a distinct marker for maturity. Complete convergence of five
   carpells on the 9th week after fruit set, heralds the onset of
   maturation in Indian hog plum and which was adjudged as visual index of
   maturity. Hardening of endocarp begins after attainment of optimum
   maturity and last for 2 weeks. Pre-climacteric plunge in respiration
   along with coordinated changes in pigments, and accumulation of ascorbic
   acid, phenols, presets the optimum maturity period of 9th week after
   fruit set. Pre-climacteric falls in respiration with lowest output of
   40.57 mg CO2/kg-h concentration on 9th week after fruit set indicates
   the attainment of fruit maturity. Harvesting of hog plum between 9th and
   11th weeks provides the fruit with soft endocarp and complete edibility.

Title = {{Interaction of the TNFR-Receptor Associated Factor TRAF1 with I-Kappa B
   Kinase-2 and TRAF2 Indicates a Regulatory Function for NF-Kappa B
   Signaling}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: I-kappa B kinase 2 (IKK2 or IKK-beta) is one of the most
   crucial signaling kinases for activation of NF-kappa B, a transcription
   factor that is important for inflammation, cell survival and
   differentiation. Since many NF-kappa B activating pathways converge at
   the level of IKK2, molecular interactions of this kinase are pivotal for
   regulation of NF-kappa B signaling.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We searched for proteins interacting
   with IKK2 using the C-terminal part (amino acids 466-756) as bait in a
   yeast two-hybrid system and identified the N-terminal part (amino acids
   1-228) of the TNF-receptor associated factor TRAF1 as putative
   interaction partner. The interaction was confirmed in human cells by
   mammalian two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The
   IKK2/TRAF1 interaction seemed weaker than the interaction between TRAF1
   and TRAF2, an important activating adapter molecule of NF-kappa B
   signaling. Reporter gene and kinase assays using ectopic expression of
   TRAF1 indicated that it can both activate and inhibit IKK2 and NF-kappa
   B. Co-expression of fluorescently tagged TRAF1 and TRAF2 at different
   ratios implied that TRAF1 can affect clustering and presumably the
   activating function of TRAF2 in a dose dependent manner.
   Conclusions/Significance: The observation that TRAF1 can either activate
   or inhibit the NF-kappa B pathway and the fact that it influences the
   oligomerization of TRAF2 indicates that relative levels of IKK2, TRAF1
   and TRAF2 may be important for regulation of NF-kappa B activity. Since
   TRAF1 is an NF-kappa B induced gene, it might act as a feedback effector
   molecule.}},

Abstract = {{We use a series of Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the theory of
   galaxy-galaxy lensing by non-spherical dark matter haloes. The
   simulations include a careful accounting of the effects of multiple
   deflections on the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal. In a typical
   observational data set where the mean tangential shear of sources with
   redshifts z(s) similar or equal to 0.6 is measured with respect to the
   observed symmetry axes of foreground galaxies with redshifts z(l)
   similar or equal to 0.3, we find that the signature of anisotropic
   galaxy-galaxy lensing differs substantially from the simple expectation
   that one would have in the absence of multiple deflections. In general,
   the observed ratio of the mean tangential shears,
   gamma+(theta)/gamma-(theta), is strongly suppressed compared to the
   function that one would measure if the intrinsic symmetry axes of the
   foreground galaxies were known. Depending upon the characteristic masses
   of the lenses, the observed ratio of the mean tangential shears may be
   consistent with an isotropic signal (despite the fact that the lenses
   are non-spherical), or it may even be reversed from the expected signal
   (i.e. the mean tangential shear for sources close to the observed minor
   axes of the lenses may exceed the mean tangential shear for sources
   close to the observed major axes of the lenses). These effects are
   caused primarily by the fact that the images of the lens galaxies have,
   themselves, been lensed and therefore the observed symmetry axes of the
   lens galaxies differ from their intrinsic symmetry axes. We show that
   the effects of lensing of the foreground galaxies on the observed
   function gamma+(theta)/gamma-(theta) cannot be eliminated simply by the
   rejection of foreground galaxies with very small image ellipticities nor
   by simply focusing the analysis on sources that are located very close
   to the observed symmetry axes of the foreground galaxies. We conclude
   that any attempt to use a measurement of gamma+(theta)/gamma-(theta) to
   constrain the shapes of dark matter galaxy haloes must include Monte
   Carlo simulations that take multiple deflections properly into account.}},

Abstract = {{We use shear wave splitting (SWS) analysis and double-difference
   relocation to examine temporal variations in seismic properties prior to
   and accompanying magmatic activity associated with the 2008 eruption of
   Okmok volcano, Alaska. Using bispectrum cross-correlation, a multiplet
   of 25 earthquakes is identified spanning five years leading up to the
   eruption, each event having first motions compatible with a normal fault
   striking NE-SW. Cross-correlation differential times are used to
   relocate earthquakes occurring between January 2003 and February 2009.
   The bulk of the seismicity prior to the onset of the eruption on 12 July
   2008 occurred southwest of the caldera beneath a geothermal field.
   Earthquakes associated with the onset of the eruption occurred beneath
   the northern portion of the caldera and started as deep as 13 km.
   Subsequent earthquakes occurred predominantly at 3 km depth, coinciding
   with the depth at which the magma body has been modeled using geodetic
   data. Automated SWS analysis of the Okmok catalog reveals radial
   polarization outside the caldera and a northwest-southeast polarization
   within. We interpret these polarizations in terms of a magma reservoir
   near the center of the caldera, which we model with a Mogi point source.
   SWS analysis using the same input processing parameters for each event
   in the multiplet reveals no temporal changes in anisotropy over the
   duration of the multiplet, suggesting either a short-term or small
   increase in stress just before the eruption that was not detected by
   GPS, or eruption triggering by a mechanism other than a change of stress
   in the system.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the prevalence of Mycobacterium avium subspecies
   paratuberculosis (MAP) infection in dairy goats was carried out in
   France, using a serological ELISA. One hundred and five herds were
   randomly selected in different regions, and all the goats aged six
   months or older (11,847 goats) were sampled. An estimation had
   previously been made of the accuracy of the HASA, and the Rogan-Gladen
   estimator was used to convert apparent prevalence values into estimates
   of true prevalence values. Given that sensitivity and specificity at
   herd level are functions of sample size, and because the sizes of the
   herds varied considerably, the true prevalence of infection at herd
   level was estimated using a weighted average depending on the herd size
   stratum. At the level of the individual animal, the total true
   prevalence was estimated by applying a weighted average in accordance
   with the regional distribution of the animals in the target population.
   At herd level, apparent prevalence and estimated true prevalence were
   55.2 and 62.9 per cent, respectively; at individual animal level they
   were 2.9 and 6.6 per cent, respectively. In herds that were seropositive
   for MAP, the average within-herd apparent prevalence was 5.9 per cent

Abstract = {{A novel micronization technique for pharmaceutical powders has been

   beads milling in LN2 was named ``ultra cryo-milling{''} in this paper.
   The operational conditions including the size/amount of beads made of
   zirconia and agitation speed were optimized to obtain the finer
   particles. It was found that the original crystals were effectively
   broken down into submicron particles, and the ultra cryo-milled
   particles were much finer and more uniform in size and shape than the
   conventional jet-milled particles. Dried powder was recovered
   continuously after milling process because LN2 was spontaneously
   evaporated at ambient temperature/pressure. Further, it was shown that
   this technique is applicable to the drugs with wide range of
   physicochemical features including heat-sensitive and water-soluble
   drugs. However, the resultant fine particles intrinsically tended to
   form the agglomerated masses. The crystalline analysis indicated that
   the both crystal form and crystallinity of the original bulk drugs
   completely remained after ultra cryo-milling process. The results
   demonstrated that the ultra cryo-milling would be a fundamental
   technique to produce the pharmaceutical nanocrystals by one step. (C)

Abstract = {{In situ ion drift observations from the ROCSAT-1 satellite, near the 600
   km altitude and for the years 1999-2003, are used to describe variations
   in the local time (LT) distribution of meridional E x B drifts at low
   and middle latitudes, for different longitudes and seasons. We derive
   the ion drifts in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field
   during quiet times defined by Kp <= 3 and Dst > -100 nT. Offsets in the
   original data are removed by considering separately the northbound and
   southbound passes in a given volume and by enforcing magnetic conjugacy
   for the ion drift components perpendicular to the magnetic field. Three
   major features are identified for which the variations in latitude,
   longitude, and season allow the major drivers of these features to be
   indicated: (1) a latitude/magnetic apex height variation in the
   prereversal (after sunset) enhancement of the vertical drift that is
   attributed to similar variations in the flux tube-integrated Pedersen
   conductivity, (2) the daytime meridional drifts that are largely driven
   by the E region dynamo show significant latitude variations that are
   attributed to the relative importance of diurnal and semidiurnal wind
   fields as a function of latitude, and (3) a downward enhancement of the
   ion drift before sunrise is attributed to a reversal in the F region
   zonal wind during the nighttime.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate whether it is possible to explain the wide range of
   observed gradients in early-type galaxies in the framework of monolithic
   models. To do so, we extend the set of hydrodynamical simulations by
   Pipino et al. by including low-mass ellipticals and spiral (true)
   bulges. These models satisfy the mass-metallicity and the
   mass-{[}alpha/Fe] relations. The typical metallicity gradients predicted
   by our models have a slope of -0.3 dex per decade variation in radius,
   consistent with the mean values of several observational samples.
   However, we also find a few quite massive galaxies in which this slope
   is -0.5 dex per decade, in agreement with some recent data. In
   particular, we find a mild dependence from the mass tracers when we
   transform the stellar abundance gradients into radial variations of the
   Mg-2 line-strength index, but not in the Mg-b. We conclude that, rather
   than a mass-slope relation, is more appropriate to speak of an increase
   in the scatter of the gradient slope with the galactic mass. We can
   explain such a behaviour with different efficiencies of star formation
   in the framework of the revised monolithic formation scenario, hence the
   scatter in the observed gradients should not be used as an evidence of
   the need of mergers. Indeed, model galaxies that exhibit the steepest
   gradient slopes are preferentially those with the highest star formation
   efficiency at that given mass.}},

   properties in an evolving urban plume}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{The recently developed particle-resolved aerosol box model PartMC-MOSAIC
   (Particle Monte Carlo model-Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions
   and Chemistry) was used to rigorously simulate the evolution of aerosol
   mixing state and the associated optical and cloud condensation nuclei
   (CCN) activation properties in an idealized urban plume. The model
   explicitly resolved the size and composition of individual particles
   from a number of sources and tracked their evolution due to
   condensation, evaporation, coagulation, emission, and dilution. The
   ensemble black carbon (BC)-specific absorption cross section increased
   by 40\% over the course of 2 days due to BC aging by condensation and
   coagulation. Threefold and fourfold enhancements in CCN/CN ratios were
   predicted to occur within 6 h for 0.2\% and 0.5\% supersaturations (S),
   respectively. The particle-resolved results were used to evaluate the
   errors in the optical and CCN activation properties that would be
   predicted by a conventional sectional framework that assumes
   monodisperse, internally mixed particles within each bin. This
   assumption artificially increased the ensemble BC-specific absorption by
   14-30\% and decreased the single scattering albedo (SSA) by 0.03-0.07,
   while the bin resolution had a negligible effect. In contrast, the
   errors in CCN/CN ratios were sensitive to the bin resolution for a
   chosen supersaturation. For S = 0.2\%, the CCN/CN ratio predicted using
   100 internally mixed bins was up to 25\% higher than the
   particle-resolved results, while it was up to 125\% higher using 10
   internally mixed bins. Neglecting coagulation overpredicted aerosol
   water content and number concentrations (<0.2 mu m), causing errors in
   SSA from -0.02 to 0.035 and overprediction of CCN concentrations by
   25-80\% at S = 0.5\%.}},

   were prepared by sol-gel method. The effect of copper content on the
   structural and magnetic properties was investigated by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS), field emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), vibrating
   sample magnetometer (VSM) and magnetic susceptometer. Results show that
   single spinel ferrite particles were prepared by controlling the type
   and amount of additive. Copper content has significant influence on
   magnetic properties of prepared samples. It was found that with
   increasing copper in Cu(5)Mg(0.5-x)Zh(0.5)Fe(2)O(4), saturation
   magnetizations along with grain size were increased while the values of
   coercivity were decreased. The variation of effective magnetic
   susceptibility exhibits almost linear trend with magnetic field. A
   frequency-dependence peak was observed in ac magnetic susceptibility
   versus temperature for fine particles which is well fitted by
   Vogel-Fulcher model. It was proved that there is strong magnetic

Abstract = {{Background: Because of high intersubtype HIV-1 genetic variability, it
   has been shown that subtype-specific patterns of resistance to
   antiretroviral drugs exist. We wished to ascertain whether this might be
   true for integrase inhibitors.
   Methods: We compared the susceptibility of subtype B and C HIV-1
   integrase enzymes, harboring the previously reported resistance
   mutations E92Q, N155H, and E92Q/N155H, to clinically relevant integrase
   inhibitors. This was performed biochemically using a microtiter plate
   system.
   Results: Subtype C integrase enzymes bearing the resistance mutations
   E92Q/N155H were approximately 10-fold more susceptible to each of two
   integrase inhibitors, raltegravir and elvitegravir, than were subtype B
   recombinant integrase containing the same mutations.
   Conclusion: Polymorphic differences within the subtype B and C integrase
   genes likely cause variations in the contribution of N155H alone or in
   combination with E92Q to drug resistance. It is possible that different
   viral subtypes may favor different mutational pathways, potentially
   leading to varying levels of drug resistance among different subtypes.

Abstract = {{We show that the inclusion of simple anisotropic pressures stops the
   isotropic Friedmann universe being a stable attractor as an initial or

   be significantly amplified through a simple cosmological bounce in

Abstract = {{Early Release Science observations of the cluster NGC 3603 with the WFC3
   on the refurbished Hubble Space Telescope allow us to study its recent
   star formation history. Our analysis focuses on stars with H alpha
   excess emission, a robust indicator of their pre-main sequence (PMS)
   accreting status. The comparison with theoretical PMS isochrones shows
   that 2/3 of the objects with H alpha excess emission have ages from 1 to
   10 Myr, with a median value of 3 Myr, while a surprising 1/3 of them are
   older than 10 Myr. The study of the spatial distribution of these PMS
   stars allows us to confirm their cluster membership and to statistically
   separate them from field stars. This result establishes unambiguously
   for the first time that star formation in and around the cluster has
   been ongoing for at least 10-20 Myr, at an apparently increasing rate.}},

Abstract = {{The transcription of tissue-specific and inducible genes is usually
   subject to the dynamic control of multiple activators. Dedifferentiated
   hepatic cell lines lose the expression of tissue-specific activators and
   many characteristic hepatic genes, such as drug-metabolizing cytochrome
   P450. Here we demonstrate that by combining adenoviral vectors for
   CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha), hepatocyte nuclear
   factor 4 alpha (HNF4 alpha), and constitutive androstane receptor, the
   CYP2B6 expression and inducibility by CITCO are restored in human
   hepatoma HepG2 cells at levels similar to those in cultured human
   hepatocytes. Moreover, several other phase I and II genes are
   simultaneously activated, which suggests that this is an effective
   approach to endow dedifferentiated human hepatoma cells with a
   particular metabolic competence and response to inducers. In order to
   gain insight into the molecular mechanism, we examined the cooperation
   of these three transcription factors on the CYP2B6 5'-flanking region.
   We show new CYP2B6-responsive sequences for C/EBP alpha and HNF4 alpha
   and a novel synergistic regulatory mechanism whereby C/EBP alpha, HNF4
   alpha, and constitutive androstane receptor bind and cooperate through
   proximal and distal response elements to confer a maximal level of
   expression. The results obtained from human liver also suggest that
   important differences in the expression and binding of C/EBP alpha and
   HNF4 alpha could account for the large interindividual variability of
   the hepatic CYP2B6 enzyme, which metabolizes commonly used drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Two time-division-multiplexed (TDM) sources based on fiber Bragg
   gratings were applied to monitor gas temperature, H2O mole fraction, and
   CH4 mole fraction using line-of-sight absorption spectroscopy in a
   practical high-pressure gas turbine combustor test article.
   Collectively, the two sources cycle through 14 wavelengths in the
   1329-1667 nm range every 33 mu s. Although it is based on absorption
   spectroscopy, this sensing technology is fundamentally different from
   typical diode-laser-based absorption sensors and has many advantages.
   Specifically, the TDM lasers allow efficient, flexible acquisition of
   discrete-wavelength information over a wide spectral range at very high
   speeds (typically 30 kHz) and thereby provide a multiplicity of precise
   data at high speeds. For the present gas turbine application, the TDM
   source wavelengths were chosen using simulated temperature-difference
   spectra. This approach is used to select TDM wavelengths that are near
   the optimum values for precise temperature and species-concentration
   measurements. The application of TDM lasers for other measurements in
   high-pressure, turbulent reacting flows and for two-dimensional
   tomographic reconstruction of the temperature and species-concentration
   fields is also forecast. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America}},

   planes. In addition, the density contrast within the structure is also
   assumed to be varying continuously with depth comprehending the
   geological settings of passive continental margins with concomitant
   basinal development. Both analytical and numerical approaches are used
   to derive the expression for the gravity anomaly of the structure. The

Abstract = {{Growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zygosaccharomyces bailii cells
   was monitored in the presence of sodium benzoate and eugenol alone or
   combined. The two antimicrobials' concentration, addition order, and
   timing were varied to determine and quantify any additive inhibitory
   effect on the yeasts. The yeast growth was also followed in the presence
   of ethanol, which served as solubilizer, at pertinent concentrations.
   The growth patterns are depicted as adjusted optical density compared
   with time curves. They all had sigmoid shape, described mathematically
   by a shifted logistic model that had an almost perfect fit to the data.
   The model's 3 parameters accounted for the curve's asymptote, the
   location of its inflection point and slope, which are rough measures of
   the overall growth level and its degree of suppression, the time to
   reach the peak growth rate and its retardation, and the overall growth
   rate, respectively. Maximum growth inhibition was achieved when the
   sodium benzoate and eugenol were administered together or alone in full
   dose. When each was administered alone but in 2 half dose additions,
   their efficacy dropped. When they were used together but added
   sequentially with a 24 h pause, their administration order had a
   noticeable effect on the treatment's efficacy, which depended on their
   respective concentrations. These observations are presented in a
   slightly modified version of the ``hurdle{''} ideogram. They suggest
   that sequencing the administration of antimicrobials can be a simple
   tool to probe their mode of activity and quantify their efficacy.
   Practical Application
   Reducing the amount of additives in foods is a goal pursued by many
   branches of the food industry. In microbial growth suppression, a
   promising way to accomplish such a reduction is through the
   administration of 2 or more antimicrobials, preferably natural,
   exploiting their synergism. To search for effective combinations, in
   respect to type and concentration, one needs an insight into their mode
   of activity. Sequencing their administration, as demonstrated with 2
   antimicrobials and 2 common yeasts that are involved in beverage
   spoilage, has offered a simple way to probe into certain aspects of the
   effect of antimicrobial combinations on microorganisms. The presented
   algebraic growth model enables to quantify, separately, the growth
   overall suppression, its retardation, and lowering its peak rate. The
   proposed modified version of the ``hurdles paradigm{''} helps to
   visualize the differences in the antimicrobials' general mode of
   activity and how it is affected by their sequencing.}},

Abstract = {{Mg-7Li-xY (x = 0-7 wt.\%) alloys were prepared by permanent mould
   casting method, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the
   alloys were investigated. The results show that alpha-Mg and beta-Li
   phases exist in all alloys. The Y-enriched alpha-Mg phase distributes
   along the edge of alpha-Mg phase and in the beta matrix of x = 1-7
   alloys, and Mg24Y5 mainly disperses in the beta matrix of x = 3-7
   alloys. The strength of the alloy is enhanced by adding Y element, and
   the elongation is improved with the Y content no more than 3 wt.\%. The
   as-cast Mg-7Li-3Y alloy exhibits an optimum combination of mechanical
   properties with the ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and
   elongation of 160 MPa, 144 MPa and 22\%, respectively. After
   solutionized at 400 degrees C for 3 h with a subsequent aging at 100
   degrees C, Mg-7Li-7Y alloy exhibits high ultimate tensile strength and
   yield strength, which are improved to 120\% and 152\% compared with hose
   of the as-cast Mg-7Li alloy, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The assembly and constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring in
   cytokinesis is dependent on the activation of Rho at the equatorial
   cortex by a complex, here termed the cytokinesis initiation complex,
   between a microtubule-associated kinesin-like protein (KLP), a member of
   the RacGAP family, and the RhoGEF Pebble. Recently, the activity of the
   mammalian Polo kinase ortholog Plk1 has been implicated in the formation
   of this complex. We show here that Polo kinase interacts directly with
   the cytokinesis initiation complex by binding RacGAP50C. We find that a
   new domain of Polo kinase, termed the intermediate domain, interacts
   directly with RacGAP50C and that Polo kinase is essential for
   localization of the KLP-RacGAP centralspindlin complex to the cell
   equator and spindle midzone. In the absence of Polo kinase, RacGAP50C
   and Pav-KLP fail to localize normally, instead decorating microtubules
   along their length. Our results indicate that Polo kinase directly binds
   the conserved cytokinesis initiation complex and is required to trigger
   centralspindlin localization as a first step in cytokinesis.}},

Title = {{Optimizing the Use of Garlic Oil as Antimicrobial Agent on Fresh-Cut
   Tomato through a Controlled Release System}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{M398-M405}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Encapsulation of garlic oil (GO) in beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was
   undertaken to generate a release system of antimicrobial volatiles and
   tested on microbial growth and sensory quality of fresh-cut tomato. GO
   volatile profile was characterized by gas chromatography mass
   spectrometry and to demonstrate the disadvantages of applying free GO to
   fresh-cut tomato, the effect of different free oil treatments (0, 50,
   100, and 200 mu g/100 g) on microbial growth and sensorial quality was
   tested. The effect of GO capsules (0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 g/100 g) on
   microbial growth and sensory quality of tomato was also investigated.
   Allyl disulfide was the most abundant GO compound identified. The
   release of volatiles from GO: beta-CD capsules (12: 88 {[}w/w] ratio)
   was evaluated at 100\% relative humidity (RH). Close to 70\% of GO
   volatiles were released from capsules when exposed to 100\% RH during 5
   wk. The most effective antimicrobial concentrations of free oil (100 and
   200 mu g/100 g) applied to tomatoes did not present acceptable sensory
   quality for panelists. Tomato was affected by the highest concentration
   of GO capsules applied, showing the lowest microbial growth and the
   highest sensory quality. In this context, successful encapsulation in
   beta-CD could stimulate further interest in the use of GO for the
   control of microbial growth in fresh-cut tomato.
   Practical Application
   The present study demonstrated that relative humidity in-package of
   fresh-cut tomatoes can be used as a trigger to release antimicrobial
   garlic oil volatiles from beta-cyclodextrin capsules, reducing microbial
   growth and the sensory effect of the treatment caused by the free garlic
   oil. In this context, successful encapsulation in beta-cyclodextrin
   could stimulate further interest in the use of garlic oil for the
   control of microbial growth in fresh-cut tomatoes.}},

Abstract = {{Letter position dyslexia (LPD) is a deficit in the encoding of letter
   position within words. It is characterized by errors of letter migration
   within words, such as reading trail as trial and form as from. In order
   to examine whether LPD is domain-specific, and to assess the
   domain-specificity of the visual analysis system, this study explored
   whether LPD extends to number reading, by testing whether individuals
   who have letter migrations in word reading also show migrations while
   reading numbers. The reading of words and numbers of 12 Hebrew-speaking
   individuals with developmental LPD was assessed. Experiment 1 tested
   reading aloud of words and numbers, and Experiment 2 tested
   same-different decisions in words and numbers. The findings indicated
   that whereas the participants with developmental LPD showed a large
   number of migration errors in reading words, 10 of them read numbers
   well, without migration errors, and not differently from the control
   participants. A closer inspection of the pattern of errors in words and
   numbers of two individuals who had migrations in both numbers and words
   showed qualitative differences in the characteristics of migration
   errors in the two types of stimuli. In word reading, migration errors
   appeared predominantly in middle letters, whereas the errors in numbers
   occurred mainly in final (rightmost) digits. Migrations in numbers
   occurred almost exclusively in adjacent digits, but in words migrations
   occurred both in adjacent and in nonadjacent letters. The results thus
   indicate that words can be selectively impaired, without a parallel
   impairment in numbers, and that even when numbers are also impaired they
   show different error pattern. Thus, the visual analyzer is actually an
   orthographic visual analyzer, a module that is domain-specific for the
   analysis of words. (C) 2009 Elsevier Srl. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chemosensory proteins play an important role in transporting chemical
   compounds to their receptors on dendrite membranes. In this study, two
   full-length cDNA codings for chemosensory proteins of Plutella
   xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) were obtained by RACE-PCR.
   PxylCSP3 and Pxyl-CSP4, with GenBank accession numbers ABM92663 and
   ABM92664, respectively, were cloned and sequenced. The gene sequences
   both consisted of three exons and two introns. RT-PCR analysis showed
   that Pxyl-CSP3 and Pxyl-CSP4 had different expression patterns in the
   examined developmental stages, but were expressed in all larval stages.
   Phylogenetic analysis indicated that lepidopteran insects consist of
   three branches, and PxylCSP3 and Pxyl-CSP4 belong to different branches.
   The 5' regulatory regions of Pxyl-CSP3 and Pxyl-CSP4 were isolated and
   analyzed, and the results consist of not only the core promoter
   sequences (TATA-box), but also several transcriptional elements (BR-C

Abstract = {{We present a fully differential chemical abundance analysis using very
   high resolution (lambda/delta lambda greater than or similar to 85,000)
   and very high signal-to-noise (S/N similar to 800 on average) HARPS and
   UVES spectra of 7 solar twins and 95 solar analogs, of which 24 are
   planet hosts and 71 are stars without detected planets. The whole sample
   of solar analogs provides very accurate Galactic chemical evolution
   trends in the metallicity range -0.3 < {[}Fe/H] < 0.5. Solar twins with
   and without planets show similar mean abundance ratios. We have also
   analyzed a sub-sample of 28 solar analogs, 14 planet hosts, and 14 stars
   without known planets, with spectra at S/N similar to 850 on average, in
   the metallicity range 0.14 < {[}Fe/H] < 0.36, and find the same
   abundance pattern for both samples of stars with and without planets.
   This result does not depend on either the planet mass, from 7 Earth
   masses to 17.4 Jupiter masses, or the orbital period of the planets,
   from 3 to 4300 days. In addition, we have derived the slope of the
   abundance ratios as a function of the condensation temperature for each
   star and again find similar distributions of the slopes for both stars
   with and without planets. In particular, the peaks of these two
   distributions are placed at a similar value but with the opposite sign
   to that expected from a possible signature of terrestrial planets. In
   particular, two of the planetary systems in this sample, each of them
   containing a super-Earth-like planet, show slope values very close to
   these peaks, which may suggest that these abundance patterns are not
   related to the presence of terrestrial planets.}},

Title = {{Influence of Cell Integrity on Textural Properties of Raw, High

Abstract = {{The integrity of onion cells and its impact on tissue texture after high
   pressure and thermal processing was studied. The contribution of cell
   membranes and the pectic component of cell walls on the texture
   properties of onion tissue were analyzed. Neutral red (NR) staining of
   onion parenchyma cell vacuoles was used for the evaluation of cell
   membrane integrity and microscopic image analysis was used for its
   quantification. The content of methanol in tissue as a result of pectin
   methylesterase activity was used to evaluate the pectin component of the
   middle lamella and cell walls and the hardening effect on the tissue
   after processing. High pressure treatments consisted of 5-min holding
   times at 50, 100, 200, 300, or 600 MPa. Thermal treatments consisted of
   30-min water bath exposure to 40, 50, 60, 70, or 90 degrees C. In the
   high pressure treatments, loss of membrane integrity commenced at 200
   MPa and total loss of membrane integrity occurred at 300 MPa and above.
   In the thermal treatments, membrane integrity was lost between 50 and 60
   degrees C. The texture of onions was influenced by the state of the
   membranes and texture profiles were abruptly modified once membrane
   integrity was lost. Hardening of the tissue corresponded with pressure
   and temperature PME activation and occurred after membrane integrity
   loss.
   Practical Application
   The texture of vegetables is an important quality attribute that affects
   consumer preference. Loss of textural integrity also indicates that
   other biochemical reactions that affect color, flavor, and nutrient
   content may occur more rapidly. In this study, we analyzed changes in
   the texture of onions after preservation with heat and high pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Proton and electron acceleration in a fragmenting periodic current sheet

   scenario. The aim is to understand the role of CS fragmentation in
   high-energy beam generation in solar flares. We combine
   magnetohydrodynamics and test-particle models to consider particle
   trajectories consistent with a time-dependent reconnection model. It is
   shown that accelerated particles in such a model form two distinct
   populations. Protons and electrons moving in open magnetic field have
   energy spectra that are a combination of the initial Maxwellian
   distribution and a power-law high-energy (E > 20 keV) part. The second
   population contains particles moving in a closed magnetic field around
   O-points. These particles move predominantly along the guiding field and
   their energies fall within quite a narrow range between similar to 1 MeV
   and similar to 10 MeV. It is also found that particles moving in an open
   magnetic field have a considerably wider pitch-angle distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid water is described in two-state theory as mixture of localised
   molecular arrangements having different structure and density, the
   low-density (LDW) and high-density water (HDW). Theoretical calculations
   describe the formation of LDW and/or HDW domains, while their lifetime
   remains unknown. As ions partition selectively into LDW or HDW,
   modifying the water structuring, time-resolved photoinduced Delayed
   Luminescence (DL) of different salts solutions was measured. When
   formation of LDW domains is foreseen, significant DL signal was found,
   whose decay-time probability distribution is maximum in microsecond
   range. This result suggests the existence of such long lifetimes
   structures, which can participate in biological processes. (C) 2010

Title = {{Human beta(1)-Adrenergic Receptor Is Subject to Constitutive and

Abstract = {{The beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) is the predominant beta AR
   in the heart, mediating the catecholamine-stimulated increase in cardiac
   rate and force of contraction. Regulation of this important G
   protein-coupled receptor is nevertheless poorly understood. We describe
   here the biosynthetic profile of the human beta(1)AR and reveal novel
   features relevant to its regulation using an inducible heterologous
   expression system in HEK293(i) cells. Metabolic pulse-chase labeling and
   cell surface biotinylation assays showed that the synthesized receptors
   are efficiently and rapidly transported to the cell surface. The N
   terminus of the mature receptor is extensively modified by sialylated
   mucin-type O-glycosylation in addition to one N-glycan attached to
   Asn(15). Furthermore, the N terminus was found to be subject to limited
   proteolysis, resulting in two membrane-bound C-terminal fragments.
   N-terminal sequencing of the fragments identified two cleavage sites
   between Arg(31) and Leu(32) and Pro(52) and Leu(53), which were
   confirmed by cleavage site and truncation mutants. Metalloproteinase
   inhibitors were able to inhibit the cleavage, suggesting that it is
   mediated by a matrix metalloproteinase or a disintegrin and
   metalloproteinase (ADAM) family member. Most importantly, the N-terminal
   cleavage was found to occur not only in vitro but also in vivo. Receptor
   activation mediated by the beta AR agonist isoproterenol enhanced the
   cleavage in a concentration-and time-dependent manner, and it was also
   enhanced by direct stimulation of protein kinase C and adenylyl cyclase.
   Mutation of the Arg(31)-Leu(32) cleavage site stabilized the mature
   receptor. We hypothesize that the N-terminal cleavage represents a novel
   regulatory mechanism of cell surface beta(1)ARs.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum liquids-known to be realized in He-3, He-4 and electrons in
   metals-generally exhibit instabilities unforeseen under classical
   Newtonian dynamics, such as the superfluid and superconducting
   transitions. Recently, a new quantum liquid, now known as the quantum
   spin liquid, has been discovered in frustrated antiferromagnetic
   spin-1/2 systems(1,2). In this state, quantum fluctuations of spins
   prevent classical antiferromagnetic ordering even at absolute zero,
   similar to the situation in the well-known quantum liquids. A
   fundamental question that has remained open is whether instabilities
   other than classical ordering can occur in a quantum spin liquid, as
   well as in the well-known quantum liquids. Here we demonstrate
   experimentally that a quantum spin liquid in an organic
   triangular-lattice antiferromagnet undergoes an instability involving
   symmetry breaking and/or topological ordering(3), possibly giving rise
   to a new quantum state of matter. Our result reveals a new variety of
   quantum-liquid instability, which might become a comparable concept to
   the already-known fermion-liquid instabilities (such as
   Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing and Peierls instability) and
   boson-liquid instability (Bose-Einstein condensation).}},

Abstract = {{AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is recognized as a regulator of
   energy homeostasis. We have previously reported that basic fibroblast
   growth factor (FGF-2) stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF) release through the activation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated
   protein (MAP) kinase and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun
   N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. In the
   present study, we investigated the involvement of AMPK in
   FGF-2-stimulated VEGF release in these cells. FGF-2 time-dependently
   induced the phosphorylation of AMPK alpha-subunit (Thr-172). Compound C,
   an AMPK inhibitor, which suppressed the FGF-2-induced phosphorylation of
   AMPK, significantly inhibited the VEGF release stimulated by FGF-2. The
   AMPK inhibitor also reduced the mRNA expression of VEGF induced by
   FGF-2. The FGF-2-induced phosphorylation of both p44/p42 MAP kinase and
   SAPK/JNK was attenuated by compound C. These results strongly suggest
   that AMPK positively regulates the FGF-2-stimulated VEGF synthesis via
   p44/p42 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK in osteoblasts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{CoNb2O6 is a material with remarkable properties that are determined by
   an exciting interplay of quantum mechanics and geometric frustration. On
   the one hand, weakly coupled ferromagnetic Ising chains of Co2+ ions can
   be tuned by an applied magnetic field through a quantum critical point
   to be paramagnetic; on the other hand, the Ising chains must contend
   with residual interactions on a frustrated triangular lattice in their
   choice of how to order. Motivated by the material, we theoretically
   study the phase diagram of quantum ferromagnetic Ising chains coupled
   antiferromagnetically on a triangular lattice in the plane perpendicular
   to the chain direction. We combine exact solutions of the quantum
   criticality in the isolated chains with perturbative approximations for
   the frustrated interchain couplings. When the triangular lattice has an
   isosceles distortion, which occurs in the real material, the phase
   diagram at absolute zero temperature is rich with five different states
   of matter: ferrimagnetic, Neel, antiferromagnetic, paramagnetic and
   incommensurate phases, separated by quantum phase transitions.
   Implications of our results on experiments in CoNb2O6 are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc selenide nanopowders with different structures were synthesized
   from sodium hydroxide solution by hydrothermal method at different
   temperatures with zinc and selenium powders as the precursors. The
   powders composed of different nanostructures were investigated by X-ray

   spectroscopy. The results indicate that the products have zincblende
   structure and become inhomogeneous with increasing temperature. The
   peaks in the Raman spectra relate to zinc selenide and impurity. In
   addition, the Raman spectra show that the shapes of the Raman peaks
   depend on the structure and size of the zinc selenide particles in
   powders. It also shows that the Raman scattering is greatly enhanced
   when the size of the zinc selenide particles is about 10 nm, which
   relates to the resonance scattering. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Based on the model of the single TEM00 Gaussian beam optical tweezers,
   the transverse and longitudinal optical trapping forces of
   micro-particles are calculated by ray-optics theory. The similarities
   and differences of the longitudinal optical trap shapes, which are

   between the optical trap stiffness and the particle parameters which
   include the size and refractive index (RI), and found that the ratio of
   the transverse and longitudinal stiffness is a constant when the
   refractive indices of the particles are the same. Through the analysis,
   the results show that there is an important relationship between the
   optical stiffness and the product of particle RI and radius. With this
   relationship, we can obtain the particle RI by measuring the optical
   stiffness and the particle radius. This novel micro-particle RI
   measurement method is of great usefulness in atmospheric environmental

Abstract = {{Spectral reflectance of cereal canopies measured with a digital camera
   correlated closely with N status during the vegetative and early stem
   elongation phases. Photos of the crops taken at a height of about In
   were processed to indicate the canopy cover (CC) on a 0-1 scale
   representing the proportion of pixels that met a criterion of greenness,
   (1 + L)Green-Red/Green+Red+L > 0. where Green and Red are reflectance
   values of the green and red bands of the camera's colour detector and L
   is a soil base line. The values of CC measured at one site were closely
   correlated with values of leaf area index (LAI), above-ground biomass
   and N content for two wheat cultivars with different growth habits. The
   functions obtained by calibration were validated on cereal crops at
   other sites and with different cultivars. The estimate of N content was
   more precise than the other crop properties, with a root mean square
   error of 16\% of the range of values. Similar values of CC were obtained
   with three different brands of digital cameras. The CC values were
   closely correlated (R-2 > 0.86) with the normalised difference
   vegetation indices (NDVI) from the commercial GreenSeeker (R) and Yara
   N-Sensor, which detect the red and near infra-red reflectances of the
   crop canopy. We conclude that estimates obtained from a digital camera
   or specialised sensors provide equivalent information about crop-N
   supply to a crop. However information is needed about crop-N demand as
   well as N supply in order to estimate fertilizer-N requirement. The use
   of a handheld computer with an inbuilt digital camera offers a method of
   combining N supply and demand data to estimate fertilizer-N requirement.

   that, as the stromal layer is reduced (similar to 150 mu m depth), there

Abstract = {{Responses to contralaterally presented tone bursts were recorded from
   single auditory neurons in the rat's dorsal cortex of the inferior
   colliculus (ICd). Most of these neurons either had low level of firing
   or generated no action potentials in the absence of sound stimulation.
   In response to tone bursts, about half of the ICd neurons fired at the
   onset while about 40\% of the neurons fired over the entire duration of
   the sounds. The remaining ICd neurons fired transiently at the offset or
   both the onset and the offset of the sounds. In comparison with neurons
   in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, neurons in the ICd
   had much longer first spike latencies and much larger magnitudes of
   jitter in the first spike latency. Many neurons in the ICd displayed
   complex frequency tuning properties. No strong correlation was revealed
   between the characteristic frequency of a neuron and its location along
   an axis oriented from a rostrodorsolateral to a caudoventromedial part
   of the ICd. There are neurons in the ICd showing stimulus-specific
   adaptation. For these neurons, presentations of a tone burst elicited
   stronger responses when these presentations were embedded in a train of
   tone bursts with various different frequencies than clustered in a
   block. Neurons with stimulus-specific adaptation displayed phasic firing
   at the onset of a tone burst. Our results suggest that the ICd is
   important for detecting novel sounds in the acoustic environment. (C)

Journal = {{CURRENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{601-607}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Different methods exist for measuring water and solute flux in and below
   the root zone. Besides indirect methods (e. g. water balance,
   tensiometer, time domain reflectometry, frequency domain reflectometry
   and environmental tracer), direct methods (e. g. drainage-type
   lysimeter, water flux meter) have a long tradition and have been
   successfully used in seepage research. However, lysimeters are most
   reliable and accurate for in situ water and solute assessment. A large
   weighable outdoor lysimeter is the best method for obtaining reliable
   data about seepage water quantity and quality, but it involves
   significant investment and additional expenses for maintenance. To
   tackle this problem new methods for the vertical collection of large
   volume soil monoliths and for the placement of the lysimeter in a
   container lysimeter unit have been developed. The design of lysimeters
   typically used in Europe - a weighable gravitation lysimeter and a
   weighable groundwater lysimeter are explained. An example is given for
   the high precision of the new lysimeter weighing technique. Besides
   recording rainfall and seepage, its weighing precision makes it possible
   to register mass input by dew, fog or rime. It also permits accurate
   calculation of actual evapotranspiration. The newly developed lysimeter
   types will be an essential tool for scaling up results obtained in
   small-scale experiments to larger geographical units. Furthermore, the
   newly developed experimental set-up allows a scenario simulation of
   topical climatic and hydrologic questions, e. g. global warming and its
   impact on the water and solute balance, the influence of dew and fog on
   the establishment of a vegetation cover in arid areas or the transport
   of contaminants during heavy rainfall following a severe drying-up of
   the soil profile.}},

Abstract = {{In the vertebrate central nervous system, maturation of oligodendrocytes
   is accompanied by a dramatic transformation of cell morphology.
   Juxtanodin (JN) is an actin cytoskeleton-related oligodendroglial
   protein that promotes arborization of cultured oligodendrocytes. We
   performed in vitro and in culture experiments to further elucidate the
   biochemical effects, molecular interactions, and activity regulation of
   JN. Pulldown and co-sedimentation assays confirmed JN binding to
   filamentous but not globular beta-actin largely through a C-terminal
   domain of 14 amino acid residues. JN had much lower affinity to
   F-alpha-actin than to F-beta-actin. Bundling and actin polymerization
   assays revealed no JN influence on F-beta-actin cross-linking or
   G-beta-actin polymerization. Sedimentation assay, however, demonstrated
   that JN slowed the rate of F-beta-actin disassembly induced by dilution
   with F-actin depolymerization buffer. JN-S278E mutant, a mimic of
   phosphorylated JN at serine 278, exhibited a much diminished
   affinity/stabilizing effect on F-beta-actin. Immunoblotting revealed
   both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated native JN of the brain, with
   the former migrating slightly slower than the latter and becoming
   undetectable when brain lysate was subjected to in vitro
   dephosphorylation prior to being loaded for electrophoresis. In cultured
   OLN-93 cells, overexpression of JN promoted the formation of actin
   fibers and inhibited F-actin disassembly induced by latrunculin A. S278E
   phosphomimetic mutation resulted in loss of JN activity in cultured
   cells, whereas S278A, T258A, and T258E dephospho-/phosphomimetic
   mutations did not. These findings establish JN as an actin
   cytoskeleton-stabilizing protein that may play active roles in
   oligodendroglial differentiation and myelin formation. Specific
   phosphorylation of JN might serve as an important mechanism regulating
   JN functions.}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium (Cd) exposure results in numerous pathological consequences
   including oxidative stress and dyslipidemia. The present study was
   designed to investigate the efficacy of combined treatment with
   quercetin (QE) and alpha-tocopherol (AT) against Cd-induced oxidative
   stress and alterations in lipids and lipoproteins in the plasma and
   liver of rats. Oral administration of Cd (5 mg/kg bw/d) for 4 wk has
   shown a significant (P < 0.05) increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive
   substances (TBARS), lipid hydro peroxides (LOOH), total cholesterol, low
   density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low density lipoprotein
   cholesterol (VLDL-C), free fatty acids (FFA), phospholipids (PL),
   triglycerides (TGs), and the activity of
   hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) in
   plasma with a significant (P > 0.05) reduction in the levels of reduced
   glutathione (GSH), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and the
   activity of lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) in plasma. In
   addition, the levels of hepatic thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
   (TBARS), LOOH, conjugated dienes (CD), protein carbonyls (PC), and the
   activity of HMG-CoA reductase, levels of cholesterol, FFA, and TGs were
   significantly (P > 0.05) increased and the level of PL is significantly
   (P > 0.05) decreased along with the decreased activity of LCAT in the
   liver of Cd-treated rats. Oral supplementation with QE (50 mg/kg bw/d)
   and AT (50 mg/kg bw/d) for 4 wk in Cd intoxicated rats significantly (P
   > 0.05) has reduced the plasma levels of TBARS, LOOH, GSH, cholesterol,
   FFA, TGs, VLDL-C, LDL-C, and the activity of HMG-CoA and significantly
   (P > 0.05) has increased the activity of LCAT and the plasma levels of
   HDL-C. The oral supplementation also significantly (P > 0.05) has
   reduced the hepatic oxidative stress markers, cholesterol, TGs, FFA, and
   significantly (P > 0.05) has increased the LCAT activity and the PL in
   liver. Our results indicate that the combined treatment with QE and AT
   has normalized all the previously mentioned biochemical parameters in
   Cd-intoxicated rats than the individual treatments. The combined
   treatment has provided remarkable protection against Cd-induced
   oxidative stress and alterations in lipid metabolism and, thereby,
   reduced the Cd-mediated cardiovascular diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the total phenolic extracts
   and antioxidant activity and anthocyanins of varieties of the
   investigated plants. These plants include oregano, thyme, terebinth, and
   pomegranate. The optimum extraction conditions including temperature and

   phenolic and anthocyanin extracts were examined according to
   Folin-Ciocalteu assay and Rabino and Mancinelli method, respectively.
   The effect of different extracting solvents and temperatures on extracts
   of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins were studied. Plant samples were
   evaluated for their antioxidant chemical activity by 2,
   2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazl assay, to determine their potential as a
   source of natural antioxidant. Results showed that all tested plants
   exhibited appreciable amounts of phenolic compounds. The methanolic
   extract (60 degrees C) of sour pomegranate peel contained the highest
   phenolic extract (4952.4 mg/100 g of dry weight). Terebinth green seed
   had the lowest phenolic extract (599.4 mg/100 g of dry weight).
   Anthocyanins ranged between 3.5 (terebinth red seed) and 0.2 mg/100 g of
   dry material (thyme). Significant effect of different extracting
   solvents and temperatures on total phenolics and anthocyanin extracts
   were found. The methanol and 60 degrees C of extraction conditions found
   to be the best for extracting phenolic compounds. The distilled water
   and 60 degrees C extraction conditions found to be the best for
   extracting anthocyanin.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity and specificity are classic parameters to assess and compare
   the performance of binary diagnostic tests versus a gold standard in a
   population. Another useful parameter to assess and compare the
   performance of binary tests is the weighted kappa coefficient, which is
   defined as a measure of the beyond-chance agreement between the
   diagnostic test and the gold standard. In this study, we deduce the
   maximum likelihood estimators of the weighted kappa coefficients of
   multiple binary tests and we propose an asymptotic method to compare the
   weighted kappa coefficients of multiple binary tests with regard to the
   same gold standard when all of the diagnostic tests are applied to the
   same sample of patients. We have carried out simulation experiments to
   study the type I error and the power of the method that we propose when
   we compared three binary tests. We have applied the results obtained to

Title = {{Extensive loss of translational genes in the structurally dynamic
   mitochondrial genome of the angiosperm Silene latifolia}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mitochondrial gene loss and functional transfer to the
   nucleus is an ongoing process in many lineages of plants, resulting in
   substantial variation across species in mitochondrial gene content. The
   Caryophyllaceae represents one lineage that has experienced a
   particularly high rate of mitochondrial gene loss relative to other
   angiosperms.
   Results: In this study, we report the first complete mitochondrial
   genome sequence from a member of this family, Silene latifolia. The
   genome can be mapped as a 253,413 bp circle, but its structure is
   complicated by a large repeated region that is present in 6 copies.
   Active recombination among these copies produces a suite of alternative
   genome configurations that appear to be at or near ``recombinational
   equilibrium{''}. The genome contains the fewest genes of any angiosperm
   mitochondrial genome sequenced to date, with intact copies of only 25 of
   the 41 protein genes inferred to be present in the common ancestor of
   angiosperms. As observed more broadly in angiosperms, ribosomal proteins
   have been especially prone to gene loss in the S. latifolia lineage. The
   genome has also experienced a major reduction in tRNA gene content,
   including loss of functional tRNAs of both native and chloroplast
   origin. Even assuming expanded wobble-pairing rules, the mitochondrial
   genome can support translation of only 17 of the 61 sense codons, which
   code for only 9 of the 20 amino acids. In addition, genes encoding 18S
   and, especially, 5S rRNA exhibit exceptional sequence divergence
   relative to other plants. Divergence in one region of 18S rRNA appears
   to be the result of a gene conversion event, in which recombination with
   a homologous gene of chloroplast origin led to the complete replacement
   of a helix in this ribosomal RNA.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest a markedly expanded role for nuclear
   gene products in the translation of mitochondrial genes in S. latifolia
   and raise the possibility of altered selective constraints operating on
   the mitochondrial translational apparatus in this lineage.}},

Abstract = {{Hearing impairment is the most common sensory disorder worldwide. In a
   recent study, the authors have shown that a heterozygous missense
   mutation, p. R184Q, in the connexin 26 (Cx26) is causally related to
   hearing loss. However, the functional change in the Cx26R184Q mutant
   remains unknown. This study compared the intracellular distribution and
   assembly of mutant Cx26R184Q with that of the wild-type (WT) Cx26 and
   Cx30WT in tet-on HeLa cells and the effect that the mutant protein had
   on those cells. Fluorescent localization assay of WT Cx26 showed the
   typical punctuate pattern of gap junction channel between neighboring
   expression cells. Conversely, the p. R184Q missense mutation resulted in
   accumulation of the Cx26 mutant protein in the Golgi apparatus rather
   than in the cytoplasmic membrane. Cx26R184Q coexpressed with either
   Cx26WT or Cx30WT showed perinuclear localization by bidirectional tet-on
   expression system, suggesting the impairment of the ability of both WT
   proteins to intracellular trafficking and targeting to the plasma
   membrane. Therefore, we proposed that Cx26R184Q has a dominant-negative
   effect on the function of WT Cx26 and Cx30. European Journal of Human

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is studied at
   metal-supporting electrolyte-Nafion three-phase interfaces. We first
   demonstrate that the sulfonate anions of Nafion are specifically
   adsorbed on a wide range of surfaces ranging from Pt(hkl) single-crystal
   surfaces, Pt-poly, Pt-skin {[}produced on a Pt3Ni(111) surface by
   annealing in ultrahigh vacuum, UHV] to high-surface-area nanostructured
   thin-film (NSTF) catalysts. The surface coverage by sulfonate and the
   strength of the Pt-sulfonate interaction are strongly dependent on the
   geometry and the nature of the Pt surface atoms. Also, they are found to
   behave analogous to (bi)sulfate anion-specific adsorption on these
   surfaces, where for the Pt(hkl) surfaces, the trend is Pt(111) > Pt(110)
   > Pt(100) and for the Pt-skin surface on Pt3Ni(111), the interaction
   strength is found to be Pt-skin < Pt(111). We also found that
   irrespective of the surface orientation and/or the electronic properties
   of the surface atoms, the ORR is always inhibited by the presence of
   ionomers at the electrode surface, confirming that Nafion is not a
   non-adsorbing electrolyte. Finally, the knowledge gained from studying
   well-defined Pt(hkl) surfaces is applied to propose that deactivation of
   the ORR on Nafion-covered high-surface-area catalysts is also controlled
   by specific adsorption of sulfonate anions.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a case of multiple myeloma (MM) and secondary plasma cell
   leukemia (PCL) secreting IgE-kappa immunoglobulin. To our knowledge,
   only 2 cases of IgE-producing secondary PCL have been reported in the
   medical literature. In our patient, the only tumor marker available for
   monitoring the therapeutic response to chemotherapy and allogeneic stem
   cell transplantation was the quantitative M component at serum protein
   electrophoresis (SPEP), because serum free light chains were in the
   normal range, Bence-Jones proteinuria was absent, and quantitative serum
   IgE levels provided inaccurate and erratic results, due to the prozone
   effect. This is a laboratory phenomenon that occurs when antigen excess
   interferes with antibody-based methods requiring immune complex
   formation for detection. It is important to recognize the presence of a
   prozone effect, because it can produce falsely normal results, and
   therefore it could lead clinicians to incorrect assessment of the
   response to therapy.}},

   It is shown that the highest activity of papain-CLEAs were obtained when
   using pure ethanol as precipitant, 40\% glutaraldehyde as crosslinker
   and cross-linking at 4 degrees C for 16 h. Moreover, the optimal
   catalytic conditions and operational stabilities of papain-CLEAs were
   characterized. Papain-CLEAs shifted the optimal pH from 7. 0 to 6. 0 and
   broaden the optimal temperature to the range of 50-80 degrees C.
   Papain-CLEAs also enhanced thermal and storage stabilities compared with
   free enzyme. It is indicated from the morphology that these improved
   performances resulted from the high surface area and multi-points
   covalent cross-linking structure of every single papain-CLEAs. These
   improved characters show practical advantages of papain-CLEAs in

Title = {{Lattice dynamics of rhenium trioxide from the quasiharmonic
   approximation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{The quasiharmonic theory is applied to study the lattice dynamics and
   thermal properties of rhenium trioxide, a material exhibiting the
   negative thermal-expansion phenomenon. Phonons are calculated at several
   external pressures. The pressure dependence of the M, R, and zone-center
   phonon modes is analyzed. Relying on the Gruneisen formalism an
   influence of temperature on the M phonon mode is investigated. The
   calculated free energy of the system provides predictions for the
   temperature dependence of such quantities as equilibrium volume and
   crystal thermal expansivity. The mean-squared vibrations of
   rhenium-trioxide atoms are investigated versus temperature and pressure.
   Results of the calculations indicate a softening of the M and R phonons
   with pressure and a large negative Gruneisen constants for these modes.
   A decrease in the crystal volume is observed up to 170 K. The
   thermal-expansion coefficient shows a minimum in the vicinity of 100 K
   which corresponds to a minimum of the anisotropy in the oxygen thermal
   vibrations perpendicular to the Re-O bond and along the bond. Anisotropy
   in the oxygen Debye-Waller factors follows from the anisotropy of the
   force constants at the oxygen site. Inelastic neutron-scattering
   measurements performed at room temperature are reported together with
   the generalized phonon densities of states. A comparison between present
   calculations and the experimental data as well as other theoretical
   studies is provided.}},

Abstract = {{Grid applications are normally deployed on computing nodes beforehand,
   which may cause the undesirable situation that some of these nodes (with
   hot applications deployed) are always busy whereas the others are
   consistently idle. Therefore, the overall performance (e.g. throughput
   and load balancing) of such a Grid system would be seriously degraded.
   In this paper, we present the idea of Hierarchical and Dynamic
   Deployment of Application (HDDA) in Grid to improve the system
   performance. With HDDA, an application can be dynamically deployed and
   undeployed when necessary. In order to reduce the overhead caused by
   HDDA, the Average Latency Ratio Minimum (ALR-MIN) replacement strategy
   is also proposed. It deploys applications to nodes with minimum ALR of
   Node (NALR), and evicts applications with minimum increment of ALR. The
   results of the experiment we conducted on China Grid show that HDDA can
   achieve 10 and 24\% less average complete time (ACT) than the schemes of
   non-HDDA and Static Deployment of Application (SDA), respectively.
   Additionally, throughput and load balancing of HDDA are also better than
   the other two schemas. Results of the simulation performed on a
   simulator particularly developed for this research show that our ALR-MIN
   replacement strategy results in 17\% less relative delay-time of jobs
   than the well-known Least Recently Used (LRU)-based strategies in a
   typical setting. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis and preparation of a new type of graphene composite
   material suitable for spin-coating into conductive, transparent, and
   flexible thin film electrodes in ambient conditions is reported here for
   the first time. Solution-processible graphene with diameter up to 50 mu
   m is synthesized by surfactant-assisted exfoliation of graphite oxide
   and in situ chemical reduction in a large quantity. Spin-coating the
   mixing solution of surfactant-functionalized graphene and PEDOT:PSS
   yields the graphene composite electrode (GCE) without the need for high
   temperature annealing, chemical vapor deposition, or any additional
   transfer-printing process. The conductivity and transparency of GCE are
   at the same level as those of an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode.
   Importantly, it exhibits high stability (both mechanical and electrical)
   in bending tests of at least 1000 cycles. The performance of organic
   light-emitting diodes based on a GCE anode is comparable, if not
   superior, to that of OLEDs made with an ITO anode.}},

Title = {{Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling Experiment validation
   for cirrus cloud profiling retrieval using CloudSat radar and CALIPSO
   lidar}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},

Abstract = {{A profiling retrieval algorithm for ice cloud properties, such as
   effective radius (r(e)), ice water content (IWC), and an extinction
   coefficient, has been developed to use combined CloudSat radar
   reflectivity factor (Ze) and CALIPSO attenuated backscattering
   coefficient measurements based on an optimal estimation framework.
   Developed as an operational standard data product for the CloudSat
   project, the algorithm can treat a wide range of ice cloud situations
   from optically tenuous cirrus in the upper troposphere to geometrically
   and optically thick anvil clouds. It is designed to consider the
   attenuation of thick clouds in the radar and lidar forward model
   equations and multiple scattering in the lidar data. An optimal
   estimation approach allows for inversion of the forward model equations
   so that the uncertainty due to the assumptions can be evaluated. A
   sensitivity study shows that lidar multiple scattering has to be
   accounted for carefully. As for all ice cloud retrieval algorithms,
   assumptions regarding particle habits and size distribution shapes are
   critical to the accuracy of the results. The deviation in simulated Ze
   among different size distribution assumptions is smaller than among
   different habit assumptions, which indicates that the uncertainty due to
   particle habits is larger than the size distribution assumption. Those
   uncertainties are included in the forward model error covariance matrix
   to analyze the retrieval error. The algorithm is applied to
   CloudSat-CALIPSO data as well as lidar and radar data collected by the
   ER-2 during the Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling
   Experiment mission on 22 July 2007. The retrieved r(e), IWC, and
   extinction are shown to compare favorably with coincident in situ
   measurements collected by instruments on the NASA DC-8. This algorithm
   is expected to be complementary to the set of standard data products
   that is already being produced by the CloudSat project.}},

Abstract = {{We study a ``strongly coupled{''} (SC) polariton system formed between
   the atomlike intersubband transitions in a semiconductor nanostructure
   and the terahertz optical modes that are localized at the edges of a
   gold aperture. The polaritons can be excited optically, by incoherent
   excitation with band-gap radiation, and we find that they also
   coherently scatter the same input laser, to give strikingly sharp
   ``sideband{''} (SB) spectral peaks, in the backscattered spectrum. The
   SB intensity is a sensitive track of the polariton density and they can
   be detected down to a quantum noise floor that is more than 2500 times
   lower than the excitation thresholds of comparable quantum cascade laser
   diodes. Compared with other coherent scattering mechanisms, higher-order
   SB scattering events are readily observable, and we speculate that if
   suitably optimized, the effect may find utility in a passive component
   capable of all-optical wavelength shifting for telecommunications
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of different functional groups on the free radical scavenging
   capability of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) is investigated
   using density functional theory calculations. The reaction mechanism
   that is considered in this study is the radical adduct formation. The
   reactions of a (OH)-O-center dot radical with eight different
   functionalized SWCNTs (armchair and zigzag) were studied. All of them
   were found to be exothermic and exergonic. Different sites of reaction
   were considered, and the increase on reactivity with respect to pristine
   tubes was found to be site-dependent. The presence of functional groups
   on the sidewalls of SWCNTs is predicted to increase their OH radicals
   scavenging activity. To enhance this property, the best functional
   groups are -CH2-OH for the armchair (3,3) SWCNT and -CONH-CH3 for the
   zigzag (5,0) fragment. The major conclusion from this work is that
   functionalized SWCNTs, in addition to be soluble in different media, are
   also very good free radical scavengers, being the armchair tubes better
   than the zigzag ones, when they are ultrashort fragments.}},

Title = {{Thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the Li-graphite system from
   first-principles calculations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 9}},
Abstract = {{We present an ab initio study of the thermodynamics and kinetics of
   Li(x)C(6), relevant for anode Li intercalation in rechargeable Li
   batteries. In graphite, the interlayer interactions are dominated by Van
   der Waals forces, which are not captured with standard
   density-functional theory (DFT). By calculating the voltage profile for
   Li intercalation into graphite and comparing it to experimental results,
   we find that only by correcting for vdW interactions between the
   graphene planes is it possible to reproduce the experimentally observed
   sequence of phases, as a function of Li content. At higher Li content
   the interlayer binding forces are increasingly due to Li-C interactions,
   which are well characterized by DFT. Using the calculated energies,
   corrected for the vdW interactions, we derive an ab initio lattice
   model, based on the cluster-expansion formalism, that accounts for
   interactions among Li ions in Li(x)C(6) having a stage I and stage II
   structure. We find that the resulting cluster expansions are dominated
   by Li-Li repulsive interactions. The phase diagram, obtained from Monte
   Carlo simulations, agrees well with experiments except at low Li
   concentrations as we exclude stage III and stage IV compounds.
   Furthermore, we calculate Li migration barriers for stage I and stage II
   compounds and identify limiting factors for Li mobility in the in-plane
   dilute as well as in the high Li concentration range. The Li
   diffusivity, obtained through kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, slowly
   decreases as a function of Li content, consistent with increasing Li-Li
   repulsions. However, overall we find very fast Li diffusion in bulk
   graphite, which may have important implications for Li battery anode
   optimizations.}},

Abstract = {{We map the earthquake frequency-magnitude distribution (b value) as a
   function of depth in the Reservoir Triggered Seismicity (RTS) region in
   Koyna-Warna region, in Western India. About 1600 well-located events
   recorded during 1996-2005 in the Koyna region are selected for the
   analysis. The earthquake data sets are separated in 2 km zones from 0 to
   12 km depth. The result shows a systematic decrease in b value up to 8
   km followed by an increase. The increase in b value is interpreted to be
   caused by the presence of fluids. We also investigate the spatial
   distribution of b value with depth. Significant variations in the b
   value are detected, with b ranging from b approximate to 0.7 to 1.8. Low
   b value areas at 5 km depth indicate localized high stresses which are
   favorable for future rupture. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{CRY2 Is Associated with Rapid Cycling in Bipolar Disorder Patients}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bipolar disorder patients often display abnormalities in
   circadian rhythm, and they are sensitive to irregular diurnal rhythms.
   CRY2 participates in the core clock that generates circadian rhythms.
   CRY2 mRNA expression in blood mononuclear cells was recently shown to
   display a marked diurnal variation and to respond to total sleep
   deprivation in healthy human volunteers. It was also shown that bipolar
   patients in a depressive state had lower CRY2 mRNA levels, nonresponsive
   to total sleep deprivation, compared to healthy controls, and that CRY2
   gene variation was associated with winter depression in both Swedish and
   Finnish cohorts.
   Principal Findings: Four CRY2 SNPs spanning from intron 2 to downstream
   3'UTR were analyzed for association to bipolar disorder type 1 (n =
   497), bipolar disorder type 2 (n = 60) and bipolar disorder with the
   feature rapid cycling (n = 155) versus blood donors (n = 1044) in
   Sweden. Also, the rapid cycling cases were compared with bipolar
   disorder cases without rapid cycling (n = 422). The haplotype GGAC was
   underrepresented among rapid cycling cases versus controls and versus
   bipolar disorder cases without rapid cycling (OR = 0.7, P = 0.006-0.02),
   whereas overrepresentation among rapid cycling cases was seen for AAAC
   (OR = 1.3-1.4, P = 0.03-0.04) and AGGA (OR = 1.5, P = 0.05). The risk
   and protective CRY2 haplotypes and their effect sizes were similar to
   those recently suggested to be associated with winter depression in
   Swedes.
   Conclusions: We propose that the circadian gene CRY2 is associated with
   rapid cycling in bipolar disorder. This is the first time a clock gene
   is implicated in rapid cycling, and one of few findings showing a
   molecular discrimination between rapid cycling and other forms of
   bipolar disorder.}},

   copolymer, sodium (2-acrylamido)-2-methylpropanesulfonate and
   N-dodecylmethacrylamide p(AMPS/C12), in 0.05 M aqueous NaCl was
   investigated by fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulation as well as
   by light scattering, and the results were compared with the flower
   micelle model of the minimum loop size, recently proposed by Kawata et
   al. {[}Macromolecules 2007, 40, 1174-1180]. After a sufficiently long
   simulation time, simulated p(AMPS/C12) chain with the degree of
   polymerization of 200 and C12 content of 50 mol To formed a unicore
   micelle, of which radius of gyration was much smaller than the AMPS
   homopolymer with the same degree of polymerization. The simulated
   micellar structure was analyzed in terms of density distribution
   functions for dodecyl groups, the main chain, and sulfonate groups as
   functions of the radial distance r from the center of mass of dodecyl
   groups. Only dodecyl groups exist at r less than or similar to 1.5 nm,
   and the main chain and sulfonate groups distribute in the range of r
   between 1.5 and 3.5 nm, but there were dodecyl groups coexisting with
   the main chain and sulfonate groups beyond r = 1.5 nm. All these
   structural features, as well as hydrodynamic radius data for p(AMPS/C12)
   with C12 contents higher than ca. 20 mol \% obtained by light
   scattering, agreed with the predictions of the flower micelle model of
   the minimum loop size.}},

Abstract = {{Total polyphenolic and anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions
   from wild blackberry genotypes (WB-3, WB-7, WB-10, and WB-11), a
   domesticated noncommercial breeding line (UM-601), and a commercial
   cultivar (Tupy) were evaluated for inhibition of pro-inflammatory
   responses {[}nitric oxide (NO) production, inducible nitric oxide
   synthase (iNOS) expression, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, and
   prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2))] in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated by
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At 50 mu M {[}cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) or
   catechin equivalent], most fractions significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited
   all markers. The anthocyanin-rich fraction from WB-10 and the
   proanthocyanidin-rich fraction from UM-601 exhibited the highest NO
   inhibitory activities (IC50 = 16.1 and 15.1 mu M, respectively).
   Proanthocyanidin-rich fractions from the wild WB-10 showed the highest
   inhibition of iNOS expression (IC50 = 8.3 mu M). Polyphenolic-rich
   fractions from WB-7 and UM-601 were potent inhibitors of COX-2
   expression (IC50 = 19.1 and 19.3 mu M C3G equivalent, respectively). For
   most of the extracts, antioxidant capacity was significantly correlated
   with NO inhibition. Wild genotypes of Mexican blackberries, as rich
   sources of polyphenolics that have both antioxidant and
   anti-inflammatory properties, showed particular promise for inclusion in
   plant improvement programs designed to develop new varieties with

Title = {{ExCyto PCR Amplification}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: ExCyto PCR cells provide a novel and cost effective means to
   amplify DNA transformed into competent bacterial cells. ExCyto PCR uses
   host E. coli with a chromosomally integrated gene encoding a
   thermostable DNA polymerase to accomplish robust, hot-start PCR
   amplification of cloned sequences without addition of exogenous enzyme.
   Results: Because the thermostable DNA polymerase is stably integrated
   into the bacterial chromosome, ExCyto cells can be transformed with a
   single plasmid or complex library, and then the expressed thermostable
   DNA polymerase can be used for PCR amplification. We demonstrate that
   ExCyto cells can be used to amplify DNA from different templates,
   plasmids with different copy numbers, and master mixes left on ice for
   up to two hours. Further, PCR amplification with ExCyto cells is
   comparable to amplification using commercial DNA polymerases. The
   ability to transform a bacterial strain and use the endogenously
   expressed protein for PCR has not previously been demonstrated.
   Conclusions: ExCyto PCR reduces pipetting and greatly increases
   throughput for screening EST, genomic, BAC, cDNA, or SNP libraries. This
   technique is also more economical than traditional PCR and thus broadly
   useful to scientists who utilize analysis of cloned DNAs in their
   research.}},

Title = {{Noise as control parameter in networks of excitable media: Role of the
   network topology}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3, 2}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{We analyze coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators on various network
   topologies, in particular random diluted and scale-free topologies,
   under the influence of noise. Similarly to globally coupled excitable
   units, noise acts as control parameter: changing monotonically its
   strength, the collective dynamical behavior varies from stable
   equilibrium solutions to coherent firing of a large fraction, and for
   even stronger noise to incoherent firing leading to chaotic behavior of
   the excitable elements. For strong noise the system is less sensitive to
   the network topology. The specific topology enters via the degree of
   nodes and determines the average number of spikes. Apart from
   bifurcation regions, it is the ratio of noise intensity to size that
   determines the dynamical behavior of average values. Specific behavior
   such as limit cycles may then be realized for strong noise and large
   systems or for low noise and small systems. Within bifurcation regions,
   the actual values of noise intensity and system-size matter
   independently. Here we analyze in more detail phase portraits of small
   systems. For a given noise intensity and network topology we have
   studied the regularity of signals as a function of time. We observe the
   phenomenon of system-size resonance for a whole interval of noise
   intensities as long as the degree distribution is homogeneous, so that
   no fine tuning of the noise is needed. Therefore it is plausible that
   natural systems make actually use of noise when noise is unavoidably
   present.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of adhesion molecules on vessels and subsequent leukocyte
   recruitment are critical events in vascular diseases and inflammation.
   The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of an extract of
   Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) polysaccharides (EORP), which is effective
   against cancer and immunological disorders, on adhesion molecule
   expression by human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) and the
   underlying mechanism. EORP significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS)-induced intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA and
   protein expression and reduced the binding of human monocytes to
   LPS-stimulated HASMCs. Immunoprecipitation and real-time polymerase
   chain reaction demonstrated that EORP markedly reduced the interaction
   of human antigen R protein (HuR) with the 3'-UTR of ICAM-1 mRNA in
   LPS-stimulated HASMCs. EORP treatment also suppressed extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and reduced the density of
   the shifted bands of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B after LPS-induced
   activation. In an endothelial-denuded artery model in LPS-treated mice,
   daily oral administration of EORP for 2 weeks decreased neointimal
   hyperplasia and ICAM-1 expression in the plasma and neointima. These
   results provide evidence that EORP attenuates LPS-induced adhesion
   molecule expression and monocyte adherence and that this protective
   effect is mediated by decreased ERK phosphorylation and NF-kappa B
   activation. These findings suggest that EORP has anti-inflammatory
   properties and could prove useful in the prevention of vascular diseases
   and inflammatory responses.}},

Abstract = {{A method for the simultaneous and economical determination of many trace
   elements in human milk is developed. Two multi-element hollow cathode
   lamps (HCLs) were used instead of single-element HCLs to improve the
   sample throughput of flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). The
   microwave digestion of milk is optimized prior to detection, and the
   performance characteristics of the improved analysis method are
   identified. Clinical samples are detected by both FAAS and inductively
   coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) for methodology
   evaluation. Results reveal that the proposed FAAS with multi-element
   HCLs could determine six essential minerals and trace elements within 15
   min. This method provides a linear analytical range of 0.01-10 mg L-1.
   For Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Zn, the limits of determination are 1.5, 3,
   1.8, 2.2, 2.1, and 1.3 mu g L-1, respectively. The mean relative
   standard deviations (RSDs) of intra- and interassays are lower than 7\%.
   Excellent operational characteristics of rapidity, simplicity, and
   economy make the proposed method a promising one for the quantification
   of trace elements in human milk in clinics of underdeveloped areas.}},

Abstract = {{Biological membranes are composed of a large number lipid species
   differing in hydrophobic length, degree of saturation, and charge and
   size of the headgroup. We now present data on the effect of hydrocarbon
   chain length of the lipids and headgroup composition on the lateral
   mobility of the proteins in model membranes. The trimeric glutamate
   transporter (GItT) and the monomeric lactose transporter (LacY) were
   reconstituted in giant unilamellar vesicles composed of unsaturated
   phosphocholine lipids of varying acyl chain length (14-22 carbon atoms)
   and various ratios of DOPE/DOPG/DOPC lipids. The lateral mobility of the
   proteins and of a fluorescent lipid analog was determined as a function
   of the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer (h) and lipid composition,
   using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The diffusion coefficient
   of LacY decreased with increasing thickness of the bilayer, in
   accordance with the continuum hydrodynamic model of Saffman-Delbruck.
   For GItT, the mobility had its maximum at diC18:1 PC, which is close to
   the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer in vivo. The lateral mobility
   decreased linearly with the concentration of DOPE but was not affected
   by the fraction of anionic lipids from DOPG. The addition of DOPG and
   DOPE did not affect the activity of GItT. We conclude that the
   hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer is a major determinant of molecule
   diffusion in membranes, but protein-specific properties may lead to
   deviations from the Saffman-Delbruck model.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of white matter fibers can affect the transmission of
   signals in brain circuits that normally enable integration of highly
   lateralized visual and motor processes. Here, we used diffusion tensor
   imaging tractography in combination with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to examine the specific contributions of interhemispheric and
   intrahemispheric white matter fibers to functional measures of
   hemispheric transfer and parallel information processing using bilateral
   and unilateral left and right visual field stimulation in normal and
   compromised systems. In healthy adults, a greater degree of bilateral
   processing advantage with the left (nondominant) hand correlated with
   higher integrity of callosal fibers connecting occipital cortices,
   whereas less unilateral processing advantage with the right hand
   correlated with higher integrity of left-hemispheric posterior cingulate
   fibers. In contrast, alcoholics who have compromised callosal integrity
   showed less bilateral processing advantage than controls when responding
   with the left hand and greater unilateral processing advantage when
   responding with the right hand. We also found degraded left posterior
   cingulate and posterior callosal fibers in chronic alcoholics, which is
   consistent with functional imaging results of less left posterior
   cingulate and extrastriate cortex activation in alcoholics than controls
   when processing bilateral compared with unilateral visual field
   stimulation. Together, our results demonstrated that interhemispheric
   and intrahemispheric white matter fiber pathways mediate visuomotor
   integration asymmetrically and that subtle white matter fiber
   degradation in alcoholism attenuated the normal pattern of hemispheric
   asymmetry, which may have ramifications for the efficiency of visual
   information processing and fast response execution.}},

Abstract = {{There is often an interest in knowing, for a given ligand concentration,
   how many protein molecules have one, two, three, etc. ligands bound in a
   specific manner. This is a question that cannot be addressed using
   conventional ensemble techniques. Here, a mathematical method is
   presented for separating specific from nonspecific binding in
   nonensemble studies. The method provides a way to determine the
   distribution of specific binding stoichiometries at any ligand
   concentration when using nonensemble (e.g., single-molecule) methods.
   The applicability of the method is demonstrated for ADP binding to
   creatine kinase using mass spectroscopy data. A major advantage of our
   method, which can be applied to any protein-ligand system, is that no
   previous information regarding the mechanism of ligand interaction is

Abstract = {{Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix.
   However, only few works focus their attention on its seeds, which
   constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this
   study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts
   from ``Bull's heart{''} and ``Cherry{''} varieties were analyzed against
   Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,
   Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and
   Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida
   albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding
   antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be
   active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most
   susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity,
   ``Bull's heart{''} extracts were the most active. In a general way C.
   albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The
   chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning
   organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a
   possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of three
   anionic polysaccharides (low methoxyl pectin (LMP), high methoxyl pectin
   (HMP) and alginate) on the physicochemical properties and stability of
   lactoferrin (LF)-coated lipid droplets. LMP, HMP and alginate were shown
   to adsorb to the surfaces of LF-coated droplets at neutral pH, which was
   primarily attributed to electrostatic attraction between anionic groups
   on the polysaccharide molecules and cationic patches on the protein
   surfaces. In the absence of polysaccharide, the LF-coated droplets were
   highly unstable to aggregation when heated above about 60 degrees C at
   pH 7, presumably because thermal denaturation of the adsorbed proteins
   increased droplet attraction. The addition of either LMP or HMP prior to
   heating greatly improved the thermal stability of the emulsions, with no
   aggregation being observed from 30 to 90 degrees C. On the other hand,
   the presence of anionic polysaccharides had little effect on emulsion
   stability or even promoted emulsion instability when 0 to 200 mM NaCl or
   CaCl2 was added. This study shows that the stability of LF-coated lipid
   droplets can be improved by careful selection of an appropriate type and
   amount of anionic polysaccharide to incorporate.}},

   In contrast to related reactions that proceed at -100 degrees C and

   coupling described herein occurs under mild nonbasic conditions and
   requires no stoichiometric additives. Allylation of the intermediate
   a-sulfonyl anion is more rapid than racemization, leading to a highly

   via interaction with DNA and inhibition of protein synthesis by

   induce bacterial resistance more slowly compared with conventional,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{35}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{The applicability of colour-quality metrics to solid-state light sources
   is validated and the results of the assessment of colour-rendition
   characteristics of various lamps are presented. The standard
   colour-rendering index metric or a refined colour-quality scale metric
   fails to distinguish between two principle colour-rendition properties
   of illumination: the ability to render object colours with high fidelity
   and the ability to increase chromatic contrast, especially when the
   spectra of light sources contain a few narrow-band electroluminescence
   components. Supplementing these metrics by the known figures of merit
   that measure the gamut area of a small number of test colour samples
   does not completely resolve this issue. In contrast, the statistical
   approach, which is based on sorting a very large number of test colour
   samples in respect of just-perceivable colour distortions of several
   kinds, offers a comprehensive assessment of colour-rendition properties
   of solid-state light sources. In particular, two statistical indices,
   colour-fidelity index (CFI) and colour-saturation index (CSI), which are
   the relative numbers of object colours rendered with high fidelity and
   increased saturation, respectively, are sufficient to reveal and assess
   three distinct types of solid-state light sources. These are (i)
   high-fidelity lamps, which cover the entire spectrum with the spectral
   components present in the wavelength ranges of both 530-610 nm and
   beyond 610 nm (e.g. trichromatic warm white phosphor-converted (pc)
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs), red-amber-green-blue LED clusters,
   complementary clusters of white and coloured LEDs); (ii)
   colour-saturating lamps, which lack power in the 530-610 nm wavelength
   range (e.g. red-green-blue or red-cyan-blue LED clusters) and (iii)
   colour-dulling lamps, which lack power for wavelengths longer than 610
   nm (dichromatic daylight pc LEDs and amber-green-blue LED clusters).
   Owing to a single statistical format, CSI and CFI can be used for design
   and optimization of multiwavelength LED clusters providing `smart'
   illumination with a trade-off between different colour-rendition
   characteristics.}},

Title = {{Global regulation of gene expression in response to cysteine
   availability in Clostridium perfringens}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cysteine has a crucial role in cellular physiology and its
   synthesis is tightly controlled due to its reactivity. However, little
   is known about the sulfur metabolism and its regulation in clostridia
   compared with other firmicutes. In Clostridium perfringens, the
   two-component system, VirR/VirS, controls the expression of the ubiG
   operon involved in methionine to cysteine conversion in addition to the
   expression of several toxin genes. The existence of links between the C.
   perfringens virulence regulon and sulfur metabolism prompted us to
   analyze this metabolism in more detail.
   Results: We first performed a tentative reconstruction of sulfur
   metabolism in C. perfringens and correlated these data with the growth
   of strain 13 in the presence of various sulfur sources. Surprisingly, C.
   perfringens can convert cysteine to methionine by an atypical still
   uncharacterized pathway. We further compared the expression profiles of
   strain 13 after growth in the presence of cystine or homocysteine that
   corresponds to conditions of cysteine depletion. Among the 177 genes
   differentially expressed, we found genes involved in sulfur metabolism
   and controlled by premature termination of transcription via a cysteine
   specific T-box system (cysK-cysE, cysP1 and cysP2) or an S-box
   riboswitch (metK and metT). We also showed that the ubiG operon was
   submitted to a triple regulation by cysteine availability via a T-box
   system, by the VirR/VirS system via the VR-RNA and by the VirX
   regulatory RNA. In addition, we found that expression of pfoA
   (theta-toxin), nagL (one of the five genes encoding hyaluronidases) and
   genes involved in the maintenance of cell redox status was
   differentially expressed in response to cysteine availability. Finally,
   we showed that the expression of genes involved in {[}Fe-S] clusters
   biogenesis and of the ldh gene encoding the lactate dehydrogenase was
   induced during cysteine limitation.
   Conclusion: Several key functions for the cellular physiology of this
   anaerobic bacterium were controlled in response to cysteine
   availability. While most of the genes involved in sulfur metabolism are
   regulated by premature termination of transcription, other still
   uncharacterized mechanisms of regulation participated in the induction
   of gene expression during cysteine starvation.}},

Title = {{Effect of cAMP derivates on assembly and maintenance of tight junctions
   in human umbilical vein endothelial cells}},
Journal = {{BMC CELL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Endothelial tight and adherens junctions control a variety
   of physiological processes like adhesion, paracellular transport of
   solutes or trafficking of activated leukocytes. Formation and
   maintenance of endothelial junctions largely depend on the
   microenvironment of the specific vascular bed and on interactions of the
   endothelium with adjacent cell types. Consequently, primary cultures of
   endothelial cells often lose their specific junctional pattern and fail
   to establish tight monolayer in vitro. This is also true for endothelial
   cells isolated from the vein of human umbilical cords (HUVEC) which are
   widely used as model for endothelial cell-related studies.
   Results: We here compared the effect of cyclic 3'-5'-adenosine
   monophosphate (cAMP) and its derivates on formation and stabilization of
   tight junctions and on alterations in paracellular permeability in
   HUVEC. We demonstrated by light and confocal laser microscopy that for
   shorter time periods the sodium salt of 8bromoadenosine- cAMP
   (8-Br-cAMP/Na) and for longer incubation periods
   8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (pCPTcAMP) exerted the greatest effects of
   all compounds tested here on formation of continuous tight junction
   strands in HUVEC. We further demonstrated that although all compounds
   induced protein kinase A-dependent expression of the tight junction
   proteins claudin-5 and occludin only pCPT-cAMP slightly enhanced
   paracellular barrier functions. Moreover, we showed that pCPT-cAMP and
   8-Br-cAMP/Na induced expression and membrane translocation of
   tricellulin.
   Conclusions: pCPT-cAMP and, to a lesser extend, 8-Br-cAMP/Na improved
   formation of continuous tight junction strands and decreased
   paracellular permeability in primary HUVEC. We concluded that under
   these conditions HUVEC represent a feasible in vitro model to study
   formation and disassembly of endothelial tight junctions and to
   characterize tight junction-associated proteins}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally process design and molecular design problems have been
   treated as two separate problems, with little or no feedback between
   them. Introduction of the property integration framework has allowed for
   simultaneous representation of processes and products from a property
   perspective and hence established a link between molecular and process
   design. The simultaneous approach involves solving two reverse problems.
   The first reverse problem identifies the input molecules' property
   targets corresponding to the desired process performance. The second
   reverse problem is the reverse of a property prediction problem, which
   identifies the molecular structures that match the targets identified in
   the first problem. Group contribution methods (GCM) are used to form
   molecular property operators and these help in tracking properties.
   Earlier contributions in this area have tried to include higher order
   estimation of GCM for solving the molecular design problem. In this
   work, the accuracy of property prediction is enhanced by improving the
   techniques to enumerate higher order groups. Incorporation of these
   higher order enumeration techniques increases the efficiency of property
   prediction and thus the range of applicability of group contribution
   methods to molecular design problems. This method of generation enables
   the identification of structural isomers to some extent as it puts a
   check on the possibility of nonexistence of each higher order group in
   each combination. Property operator based techniques are used to track
   properties in both process and molecular design problems. The developed
   algorithm solves the set of inequality expressions of process and
   molecular design problems simultaneously to identify the molecules that
   meet the process performance and environmental restrictions defined in
   terms of properties. Since the algorithm should be able to solve for any
   number of properties, an algebraic approach is used to generate possible
   molecules within the required property range. This contribution will use
   a case study to highlight the principles of the developed methodology.

Abstract = {{This work presents an in situ study of the adsorption/desorption
   behavior of ferrocene(Fc)-functionalized linear polymers on a gold
   surface covered with beta-cyclodextrin(beta-CD)-modified self-assembled
   monolayers (SAMs). The characterization of binary SAMs obtained with
   HS-(CH2)(11)-EG(6)-N-3 and HS-(CH2)(11)-EG(4)-OH (EG, ethylene glycol)
   was performed using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
   monitoring (QCM-D), cyclic voltammetry, and contact angle measurements.
   The functionalization of SA Ms with beta-CD was made via the ``click{''}
   reaction between the beta-CD monoalkyne derivative and azide groups
   exhibited by SA Ms. The formation of the host-guest complex between
   SAM-beta-CD and Fc-derivatized polymers (chitosan (CHI) and
   poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH)) was studied by QCM-D. The
   viscoelastic model of Voinova was used to fit QCM-D curves recorded
   during the adsorption and electrochemically controlled desorption of
   CHI-Fc and PAH-Fc on SAM-beta-CD. Using QCM-D coupled to cyclic
   voltammetry, we demonstrated that CHI-Fc and PAH-Fc can be successfully
   deposited on a SAM-beta-CD-coated gold surface forming a stable
   multivalent inclusion complex between Fe moieties of polymer and beta-CD
   cavities of SAM. We also showed that all specifically attached polymer
   chains can be detached from the SAM-beta-CD-coated gold surface by
   applying an electric field.}},

Abstract = {{Hard x-ray scattering experiments with a photon energy of 100 keV were
   performed as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field on
   selected compounds of the RFe3(BO3)4 family. The results show the
   presence of several diffraction features, in particular, nonresonant
   magnetic reflections in the magnetically ordered phase and structural
   reflections that violate the diffraction conditions for the
   low-temperature phase P3(1)21 of the rare-earth iron borates. The
   temperature and field dependence of the magnetic superlattice
   reflections corroborate the magnetic structures of the borate compounds
   obtained by neutron diffraction. The detailed analysis of the intensity
   and scattering cross section of the magnetic reflection reveals details
   of the magnetic structure of these materials such as the spin domain
   structure of NdFe3(BO3)(4) and GdFe3(BO3)(4). Furthermore we find that
   the correlation length of the magnetic domains is around 100 angstrom
   for all the compounds and that the Fe moments are rotated 53 degrees +/-
   3 degrees off from the hexagonal basal plane in GdFe3(BO3)(4).}},

Abstract = {{The intasome is the basic recombination unit of retroviral integration,
   comprising the integrase protein and the ends of the viral DNA made by
   reverse transcription. Clinical inhibitors preferentially target the
   DNA-bound form of integrase as compared with the free protein,
   highlighting the critical requirement for detailed understanding of
   HIV-1 intasome structure and function. Although previous biochemical
   studies identified integrase residues that contact the DNA, structural
   details of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions within the
   functional intasome were lacking. The recent crystal structure of the
   prototype foamy virus (PFV) integrase-viral DNA complex revealed
   numerous details of this related integration machine. Structures of
   drug-bound PFV intasomes moreover elucidated the mechanism of inhibitor
   action. Herein we present a model for the HIV-1 intasome assembled using
   the PFV structure as template. Our results pinpoint previously
   identified protein-DNA contacts within the quaternary structure and
   reveal hitherto unknown roles for Arg20 and Lys266 in DNA binding and
   integrase function. Models for clinical inhibitors bound at the HIV-1
   integrase active site were also constructed and compared with previous
   studies. Our findings highlight the structural basis for HIV-1
   integration and define the mechanism of its inhibition, which should
   help in formulating new drugs to inhibit viruses resistant to
   first-in-class compounds.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a proliferation of building and product sustainability
   standards based on the success of the LEED (TM) program from the green
   building council for new commercial building construction. A feature of
   these standards is the accumulation of points for undertaking various
   activities of different types, such as improving energy efficiency. The
   combined points total leads to certification of the product at different
   performance levels. The question is whether the standards actually
   promote products that are better from a life cycle perspective, or
   whether the standards are biased towards certain activities based on a
   perception that some activities are inherently better than others
   (recycling or bio-based materials for example). In this work, we used
   optimization methods coupled with life cycle inventory information to
   explore this question. A carpet standard is used to compare the life
   cycle optimization against an optimization to earn the maximum number of
   points in the standard. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments demonstrate that a ballistic version of spin
   resonance, mediated by spin-orbit interaction, can be induced in narrow
   channels of a high-mobility GaAs two-dimensional electron gas by
   matching the spin-precession frequency with the frequency of bouncing
   trajectories in the channel. Contrary to the typical suppression of
   D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation in confined geometries, the
   spin-relaxation rate increases by orders of magnitude on resonance.
   Here, we present Monte Carlo simulations of this effect to explore the
   roles of varying degrees of disorder and strength of spin-orbit
   interaction. Quantitative spin-orbit parameters can be extracted by
   comparing simulations of this type with experimental measurements of
   ballistic spin resonance, guiding the development of future spintronic

Abstract = {{In mammals, dendritic cells (DCs) form the key link between the innate
   and adaptive immune systems. DCs act as immune sentries in various
   tissues and, upon encountering pathogen, engulf and traffic foreign
   antigen to secondary lymphoid tissues, stimulating antigen-specific T
   lymphocytes. Although DCs are of fundamental importance in orchestrating
   the mammalian immune response, their presence and function in
   nonmammalian vertebrates is largely unknown. Because teleosts possess
   one of the earliest recognizable adaptive immune systems, we sought to
   identify antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the zebrafish to better
   understand the potential origins of DCs and their evolutionary
   relationship to lymphocytes. Here we present the identification and
   characterization of a zebrafish APC subset strongly resembling mammalian
   DCs. Rare DCs are present in various adult tissues, and can be enriched
   by their affinity for the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA). We show that
   PNA(hi) myeloid cells possess the classical morphological features of
   mammalian DCs as revealed by histochemical and ultrastructural analyses,
   phagocytose-labeled bacterial preparations in vivo, and exhibit
   expression of genes associated with DC function and antigen
   presentation, including il12, MHC class II invariant chain iclp1, and
   csf1r. Importantly, we show that PNA(hi) cells can activate T
   lymphocytes in an antigen-dependent manner. Together, these studies
   suggest that the cellular constituents responsible for antigen
   presentation are remarkably conserved from teleosts to mammals, and
   indicate that the zebrafish may serve as a unique model to study the
   origin of APC subsets and their evolutionary role as the link between
   the innate and adaptive immune systems.}},

Title = {{Lazarus1, a DUF300 Protein, Contributes to Programmed Cell Death
   Associated with Arabidopsis acd11 and the Hypersensitive Response}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background: Programmed cell death (PCD) is a necessary part of the life
   of multi-cellular organisms. A type of plant PCD is the defensive
   hypersensitive response (HR) elicited via recognition of a pathogen by
   host resistance (R) proteins. The lethal, recessive accelerated cell
   death 11 (acd11) mutant exhibits HR-like accelerated cell death, and
   cell death execution in acd11 shares genetic requirements for HR
   execution triggered by one subclass of R proteins.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To identify genes required for this PCD
   pathway, we conducted a genetic screen for suppressors of acd11, here
   called lazarus (laz) mutants. In addition to known suppressors of R
   protein-mediated HR, we isolated 13 novel complementation groups of
   dominant and recessive laz mutants. Here we describe laz1, which encodes
   a protein with a domain of unknown function (DUF300), and demonstrate
   that LAZ1 contributes to HR PCD conditioned by the Toll/interleukin-1
   (TIR)-type R protein RPS4 and by the coiled-coil (CC)-type R protein
   RPM1. Using a yeast-based topology assay, we also provide evidence that
   LAZ1 is a six transmembrane protein with structural similarities to the
   human tumor suppressor TMEM34. Finally, we demonstrate by transient
   expression of reporter fusions in protoplasts that localization of LAZ1
   is distributed between the cytosol, the plasma membrane and FM4-64
   stained vesicles.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our findings indicate that LAZ1 functions as a
   regulator or effector of plant PCD associated with the HR, in addition
   to its role in acd11-related death. Furthermore, the similar topology of
   a plant and human DUF300 proteins suggests similar functions in PCD
   across the eukaryotic kingdoms, although a direct role for TMEM34 in
   cell death control remains to be established. Finally, the subcellular
   localization pattern of LAZ1 suggests that it may have transport
   functions for yet unknown, death-related signaling molecules at the
   plasma membrane and/or endosomal compartments. In summary, our results
   validate the utility of the large-scale suppressor screen to identify
   novel components with functions in plant PCD, which may also have
   implications for deciphering cell death mechanisms in other organisms.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, optical techniques based on diffusion approximation
   have demonstrated their ability to gain rich spectral information about
   bone. However, these methods normally assume homogeneity, while
   cancellous bone and marrow form a highly heterogeneous two-phase medium.
   This paper studies the limitations of this assumption, and quantifies
   the role of microstructure on long-range transport properties. The
   propagation of light pulses through trabecular bone is calculated by
   Monte Carlo simulation of the scattering and absorption in
   reconstructions of bone samples obtained from x-ray micro tomographic
   scans. The time-resolved responses are then fitted with the analytical
   response of a homogeneous material to obtain the apparent transport
   properties. These properties are used to test different homogenization
   equations that have been postulated in the past for heterogeneous
   tissues and to check their accuracy. The results show that nonlinearity
   and crosstalk between absorption and scattering are statistically
   significant, although their impact is relatively small. More
   importantly, we found that the weight of the components is not only
   affected by their volume fractions, but need to be corrected by other
   morphologic measures like trabecular spacing or connectivity density.
   These deviations from the homogeneous assumption are stronger for
   scattering than for absorption. In conclusion, the average optical
   properties of cancellous bone are strongly determined by its
   microstructure, meaning that optical techniques are a valid method for
   tissue evaluation, but careful consideration of structure-related
   perturbation sources is required.}},

Title = {{Dissecting the Relation between a Nuclear Receptor and GATA: Binding
   Affinity Studies of Thyroid Hormone Receptor and GATA2 on TSH beta
   Promoter}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Much is known about how genes regulated by nuclear receptors
   (NRs) are switched on in the presence of a ligand. However, the
   molecular mechanism for gene down-regulation by liganded NRs remains a
   conundrum. The interaction between two zinc-finger transcription
   factors, Nuclear Receptor and GATA, was described almost a decade ago as
   a strategy adopted by the cell to up-or down-regulate gene expression.
   More recently, cell-based assays have shown that the Zn-finger region of
   GATA2 (GATA2-Zf) has an important role in down-regulation of the
   thyrotropin gene (TSH beta) by liganded thyroid hormone receptor (TR).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In an effort to better understand the
   mechanism that drives TSH beta down-regulation by a liganded TR and
   GATA2, we have carried out equilibrium binding assays using fluorescence
   anisotropy to study the interaction of recombinant TR and GATA2-Zf with
   regulatory elements present in the TSH beta promoter. Surprisingly, we
   observed that ligand (T3) weakens TR binding to a negative regulatory
   element (NRE) present in the TSH beta promoter. We also show that TR may
   interact with GATA2-Zf in the absence of ligand, but T3 is crucial for
   increasing the affinity of this complex for different GATA response
   elements (GATA-REs). Importantly, these results indicate that TR complex
   formation enhances DNA binding of the TR-GATA2 in a ligand-dependent
   manner.
   Conclusions: Our findings extend previous results obtained in vivo,
   further improving our understanding of how liganded nuclear receptors
   down-regulate gene transcription, with the cooperative binding of
   transcription factors to DNA forming the core of this process.}},

Abstract = {{One key role of many cellular membranes is to hold a transmembrane
   electrochemical ion gradient that stores free energy, which is used, for
   example, to generate ATP or to drive transmembrane transport processes.
   In mitochondria and many bacteria, the gradient is maintained by
   proton-transport proteins that are part of the respiratory
   (electron-transport) chain. Even though our understanding of the
   structure and function of these proteins has increased significantly,
   very little is known about the specific role of functional
   protein-membrane and membrane-mediated protein-protein interactions.
   Here, we have investigated the effect of membrane incorporation on
   proton-transfer reactions within the membrane-bound proton pump
   cytochrome c oxidase. The results show that the membrane acts to
   accelerate proton transfer into the enzyme's catalytic site and indicate
   that the intramolecular proton pathway is wired via specific amino acid
   residues to the two-dimensional space defined by the membrane surface.
   We conclude that the membrane not only acts as a passive barrier
   insulating the interior of the cell from the exterior solution, but also
   as a component of the energy-conversion machinery.}},

Abstract = {{In computer tomography (CT) diagnostics, the measured Hounsfield units
   (HU) are used to characterize tissue and are in that respect compared to
   nominal HU values found in the radiological literature. Quality
   assurance (QA) phantoms are commercially available with a variety of
   tissue substitutes and materials to test the HU values in CT. It is
   however recognized from CT physics that the HU for a given material is
   energy dependent and may vary substantially between scanners. The aim of
   this study is to analyze the characteristics of a commonly used QA
   phantom, the Catphan 500/600 (The Phantom Laboratory, NY). Four CT
   phantoms were scanned on one CT scanner to examine possible interphantom
   variations in HU values. Secondly, one selected phantom was scanned at
   three kVp levels on eight different CT scanners. The interphantom
   variations in HU values were small, in the range 2-5 HU. The
   interscanner variations were however substantial, in the range 7-56 HU
   depending on energy and material. Varying the x-ray energy produced a
   shift in the measured HU of up to 79 HU on one scanner. Reference HU
   values for the eight sensitometric test materials in Catphan are
   provided for eight CT scanner models from four vendors. The reference HU
   values are provided for 80, 120 and 140 kVp. Our results suggest that
   scanner-independent threshold levels for HU should be used only with
   extreme caution. Tissue characterization can be used provided that a
   scanner-specific data set for normal and abnormal is determined.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between selenium
   intake and protection from a variety of cancer. Considering this
   clinical importance of selenium, we aimed to identify the genes
   associated with resistance to selenium treatment. We have applied a
   previous methodology developed by our group, which is based on the
   genetic and pharmacological data publicly available for the NCI60 cancer
   cell line panel. In short, we have categorized the NCI60 cell lines as
   selenium resistant and sensitive based on their growth inhibition (GI50)
   data. Then, we have utilized the Affymetrix 125K SNP chip data available
   and carried out a genome-wide case-control association study for the
   selenium sensitive and resistant NCI60 cell lines. Our results showed
   statistically significant association of four SNPs in 5q33-34, 10q11.2,
   10q22.3 and 14q13.1 with selenium resistance. These SNPs were located in
   introns of the genes encoding for a kinase-scaffolding protein (AKAP6),
   a membrane protein (SGCD), a channel protein (KCNMA1), and a protein
   kinase (PRKG1). The knock-down of KCNMA1 by siRNA showed increased
   sensitivity to selenium in both LNCaP and PC3 cell lines. Furthermore,
   SNP-SNP interaction (epistasis) analysis indicated the interactions of
   the SNPs in AKAP6 with SGCD as well as SNPs in AKAP6 with KCNMA1 with
   each other, assuming additive genetic model. These genes were also all
   involved in the Ca2+ signaling, which has a direct role in induction of
   apoptosis and induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is consistent with
   the chemopreventive action of selenium. Once our findings are further
   validated, this knowledge can be translated into clinics where
   individuals who can benefit from the chemopreventive characteristics of
   the selenium supplementation will be easily identified using a simple
   DNA analysis.}},

   microbubbles (MBs) used in patients as intravascular ultrasound contrast
   agents. We propose that the modular combination of small, solid NPs and
   larger, highly compressible MBs into a single agent is an effective way
   to attain the desired complementary and hybrid properties of two very
   different agents. Presented here is a new strategy for the simple and
   robust incorporation of various medical NPs with monodisperse MBs based
   upon the controlled pH-based regulation of the electrostatic attraction
   between NPs and the MB shell. Using this simple approach,
   microfluidic-generated, protein-lipid-coated, perfluorobutane MBs (with
   size control down to 3 mu m) were incorporated with silica-coated NPs,
   including CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, gold nanorods, iron oxide NPs, and
   Gd-loaded mesoporous silica NPs. The silica interface permits NP
   inclusion within MBs to be independent of NP composition, morphology,
   and size. Significantly, the NP-incorporated MBs (NP-MBs) diluted in
   saline were detectable using low-pressure ultrasound, and the
   monodisperse M B platform can be produced at high-throughput, sufficient
   for in vivo usage (10(6) MB/sec). The modular synthesis of a variety of
   NP-MBs can facilitate flexible, user-defined, multifunctional imaging
   and therapy agents tailored for specific applications and disease types.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To evaluate a new hemostatic method using hemostatic forceps to
   prevent perforation and perioperative hemorrhage during colonic
   endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).
   METHODS: We studied 250 cases, in which ESD for colorectal tumors was
   performed at the Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine or Nara City
   Hospital between 2005 and 2010. We developed a new hemostatic method
   using hemostatic forceps in December 2008 for the efficient treatment of
   submucosal thick vessels. ESD was performed on 126 cases after adoption
   of the new method (the adopted group) and the new method was performed
   on 102 of these cases. ESD was performed on 124 cases before the
   adoption of the new method (the unadopted group). The details of the new
   method are as follows: firstly, a vessel was coagulated using the
   hemostatic forceps in the soft coagulation mode according to the
   standard procedure, and the coagulated vessel was removed using the
   forceps in the ``endocut{''} mode without perioperative hemorrhage.
   Secondly, the partial surrounding submucosa was dissected using the
   forceps in the endocut mode. In the current study, we evaluated the
   efficacy of this method.
   RESULTS: Coagulated vessels were successfully removed using the
   hemostatic forceps in all 102 cases without severe perioperative
   hemorrhage. Moderate perioperative hemorrhage occurred in five cases
   (4.9\%); however, it was stopped by immediately reuse of the hemostatic
   forceps. The partial surrounding submucosa was dissected using the
   forceps in all 102 cases. In the adopted group, the median operation
   time was 105 min. The proportion of endoscopic en bloc resection was
   92.8\% (P < 0.01) compared to 80.6\% in the unadopted group. The
   postoperative hemorrhage and perforation rates were 2.3\% and 2.3\%. The
   rate of perforation was significantly lower than that in the unadopted
   group (9.6\%, P < 0.01). We evaluated the ease of use of this method by
   allowing our three trainees to performed ESD on 46 cases, which were
   accomplished without any severe hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSION: The new method effectively treated submucosal thick vessels
   and shows promise for the prevention of perforation and perioperative
   hemorrhage in colonic ESD. (C) 2010 Baishideng. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalysts, those made from a group 8-10
   transition metal precatalyst and an AIR(3) cocatalyst, are often used
   for large scale industrial polymer hydrogenation; note that Ziegler-type
   hydrogenation catalysts are not the same as Ziegler-Natta polymerization
   catalysts. A review of prior studies of Ziegler-type hydrogenation
   catalysts (Alley et al. J. Mot CataL A: Chem. 2010, 315, 1-27) reveals
   that a 50 year old problem is identifying the metal species present
   before, during, and after Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalysis, and
   which species are the kinetically best, fastest catalysts that is, which
   species are the true hydrogenation catalysts. Also of significant
   interest is whether what we have termed ``Ziegler nanoclusters{''} are
   present and what their relative catalytic activity is. Reported herein
   is the characterization of an Ir Ziegler-type hydrogenation catalyst, a
   valuable model (vide infra) for the Co-based industrial Ziegler-type
   hydrogenation catalyst, made from the crystallographically characterized
   {[}(1,5-COD)Ir(mu-O2C8H15)](2) Precatalyst plus AlEt3. Characterization
   of this Ir model system is accomplished before and after catalysis using
   a battery of physical methods including Z-contrast scanning transmission
   electron microscopy (STEM), high resolution (HR)TEM, and X-ray
   absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. Kinetic studies plus
   Hg(0) poisoning experiments are then employed to probe which species are
   the fastest catalysts. The main findings herein are that (i) a
   combination of the catalyst precursors {[}(1,5-COD)Ir(mu-O2C8H15)](2)
   and AlEt3 gives catalytically active solutions containing a broad
   distribution of Irn species ranging from monometallic Ir complexes to
   nanometer scale, noncrystalline Ir-n nanoclusters (up to Ir-similar to
   100 by Z-contrast STEM) with the estimated mean Ir species being 0.5-0.7
   nm, Ir similar to 4-15 clusters considering the similar, but not
   identical results from the different analytical methods; furthermore,
   (ii) the mean Ir-n species are practically the same regardless of the
   AI/Ir ratio employed, suggesting that the observed changes in catalytic
   activity at different AI/Ir ratios are primarily the result of changes
   in the form or function of the Al-derived component (and not due to
   significant AlEt3-induced changes in initial Ir-n nuclearity). However
   (iii), during hydrogenation, a shift in the population of Ir species
   toward roughly 1.0-1.6 nm, fcc Ir(0)(similar to 40-150), Ziegler
   nanoclusters occurs with, significantly, (iv) a concomitant increase in
   catalytic activity. Importantly, and although catalysis by discrete
   subnanometer Ir species is not ruled out by this study, (v) the
   increases in activity with increased nanocluster size, plus Hg(0)
   poisoning studies, provide the best evidence to date that the
   approximately 1.0-1.6 nm, fcc Ir(O)(similar to 40-150), heterogeneous
   Ziegler nanoclusters are the fastest catalysts in this industrially
   related catalytic hydrogenation system (and in the simplest, Ockham's
   Razor interpretation of the data). In addition, (vi) Ziegler
   nanoclusters are confirmed to be an unusual, hydrocarbon-soluble, highly
   coordinatively unsaturated, Lewis-acid containing, and highly
   catalytically active type of nanocluster for use in other catalytic
   applications and other areas.}},

Abstract = {{A toxic effect of highly toxic nervous agents is irreversible inhibition
   of vitally important enzyme acethylcholinesterase (AChE). Inhibition of
   AChE results in accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) at the synaptic
   cleft of the cholinergic neurons, leading to overstimulation of
   cholinergic receptors. The highly toxic nature of tabun has been known
   for many years, but there are still serious limitations to the antidotal
   therapy.
   In this paper a bispyridinium compound K027
   {[}1-(4-hydroxyiminomethylpyridinium)-3-(-4-carbamoylpyridinium) propane
   dibromide] was tested as potential antidote in tabun poisoned mice.
   Oxime TMB-4 was included for comparison. The therapeutic efficacy of
   applied antidotal regimens was tested as pretreatment given 15 min
   before tabun poisoning and/or as therapy given 1 min after tabun
   poisoning. Using oxime K027 (25\% of its LD50) plus atropine as both,
   pretreatment and therapy, we showed that this combination can protect
   mice 8 times better than the therapy alone. Under these experimental
   conditions we confirmed good antidotal efficacy of K027. Moreover, its
   low acute toxicity is as much as beneficial effect in contrast to high
   toxicity of currently used TMB-4. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Retrograde analysis is an algorithmic technique for reconstructing a
   game tree starting from its leaves; it is useful to solve some specific
   subsets of a complex game, for example a Chess endgame, achieving
   optimal play in these situations. Position values can then be stored in
   ``tablebases{''} for instant access, in order to save analysis time, as
   is the norm in professional chess programs. This paper shows that a
   similar approach can be used to solve subsets of certain imperfect
   information games such as Kriegspiel (invisible Chess) endgames. Using a
   brute force retrograde analysis algorithm, a suitable data
   representation and a special lookup algorithm, one can achieve perfect
   play, with perfection meaning fastest checkmate in the worst case and
   without making any assumptions on the opponent. We investigate some
   Kriegspiel endgames (KRK, KQK, KBBK and KBNK), building the
   corresponding tablebases and casting light on some long standing open
   problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A metal organic framework (MOF) containing
   2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (NH2-BDC) as a building block is shown
   to undergo chemical modification with a set of cyclic anhydrides. The
   modification of the aluminum-based MOF known as MIL-53(Al)-NH2 (MIL =
   Material Institut Lavoisier). by these reagents is demonstrated by using
   a variety of methods, including NMR and electrospray ionization mass
   spectrometry (ESI-MS), and the structural integrity of the modified MOFs
   has been confirmed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder
   X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Reaction with these cyclic anhydrides produces
   MOFs that display carboxylic acid functional groups within their pores.
   Furthermore, it is shown that maleic acid functionalized
   MIL-53(Al)-AMMal can act as a Bronsted acid catalyst and facilitate the
   methanolysis of several small epoxides. Experiments show that
   MIL-53(AI)-AMMal acts in a heterogeneous manner and is recyclable with
   consistent activity over at least three catalytic cycles. The findings
   presented here demonstrate several important features of covalent
   postsynthetic modification (PSM) on MOFs, including (1) facile
   introduction of catalytic functionality using simple organic reagents
   (e.g., anhydrides); (2) the ability to utilize and recycle
   organocatalytic MOFs; (3) control of catalytic activity through choice
   of functional group. The findings clearly illustrate that covalent
   postsynthetic modification represents a powerful means to access new MOF
   compounds that serve as organocatalytic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an efficient bioscavenger of highly
   toxic organophosphorus poisons and nerve agents. However, BChE
   administered into the periphery does not provide significant protection
   of the central nervous system (CNS) due to rejection by the blood-brain
   barrier. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of delivering BChE
   to the CNS by packing it into a block ionomer complex of nanoscale size
   with a cationic poly(L-lysine)-graft-poly(ethylene oxide) (PLL-g-PEO)
   copolymer. The multimolecular structure of BChE/PLL-g-PEO complexes was
   further reinforced by formation of cross-links between the polymer
   chains. The resulting cross-linked complexes were stable against
   dilution without significant loss of BChE enzymatic activity. In some
   cases the BChE was labeled with fluorescent IRDye 800CW before it was
   incorporated into nanoparticles.BChE/PLL-g-PEO complexes were injected
   into mice intramuscularly and intravenously. In vivo imaging showed
   incorporation of the fluorescently labeled BChE in brain. Activity
   assays showed that BChE remained active in the brain at 72-h
   post-injection. It was concluded that nanocomplexes can deliver the 340
   kDa BChE tetramer to the brain. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{About 16\% of the population in Croatia is older than 65 years. Croatia
   has no register of persons with dementia (PWD), but based on a
   calculation that 10\% of persons over 65 years are affected by dementia,
   the approximate number of PWD would be 80,000, the majority being
   patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Psychogeriatric departments
   exist in hospitals, but there are almost no nursing homes and an
   insufficient number of daily care centres for PWD. Antidementia drugs
   registered in Croatia are donepezil, rivastigmine and memantine.
   Clinical studies of new antidementia drugs have been conducted in
   Croatia since 1989. At present, studies of several antidementia drugs
   are underway at different testing stages. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   low-temperature operating solid oxide fuel cells and low-temperature

   scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) electrolyte at 500 degrees C in dry
   O-2, Ag particles were deposited along the ScSZ grain boundaries. The
   phenomenon was specific to the Ag electrode on the ScSZ electrolyte.
   Because the phenomenon causes the electrical short between the cathode
   and the anode during the long time use, Ag is not appropriate as the
   anode side electrode (catalytic electrode or the current collector
   electrode of the anode side) of the actual low-temperature operating

Abstract = {{Hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide hydrogels were prepared by
   polymerizing acrylamide, using n-butyl acrylate and 2-ethyl hexyl
   acrylate as comonomers and dimethyl formamide as a solvent. We report
   here for the first time that the Alfred Q-e reactivity ratios are
   matching with the experimental value (elemental analysis result) for the
   terpolymer hydrogel systems. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   thermograms of the hydrogel samples revealed two endothermic
   transitions, one near 0 degrees C, corresponding to the melting
   transition of ice and another above ambient temperature. This high
   temperature transition is due to the rearrangement of water molecules
   engaged in hydrophobic hydration surrounding the hydrophobic groups
   (alkyl side chains). This depends on the type of hydrophobic groups and
   the gel compositions. Swelling and deswelling studies of the gels were
   performed using various solvents such as water and isopropyl alcohol. An
   abnormally high swelling and deswelling behavior was observed in the
   homopolymer gels and the gels with low amount of hydrophobic comonomers.
   This could be attributed to the more intramolecular cross-linked
   structure formed during synthesis in organic solvent. (C) 2010 Wiley

Abstract = {{Modified textile fabrics were used to remove Cu(+2) and Cr(+3) ions from

   and knitted fabrics were prepared by coating the surface with a thin
   layer of aqueous solution of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and acrylic
   acid (AAc) of thickness 25 pm. Radiation crosslinking of the coated
   layer was carried out by electron beam irradiation with a constant dose
   of 30 kGy. Morphology of the coated fabrics was examined by scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) which indicated the compatibility between the
   coated layer and fabrics. Properties attributed to the hydrophilicity,
   especially water uptake and weight loss before and after several washing
   cycles were followed up. The effect of AAc concentration on the
   hydrophilic properties of the coated fabrics was studied. A considerable
   enhancement in water uptake has been attained on increasing AAc content
   in solution in case of nylon-6 followed by polyester woven followed by
   polyester knitted fabrics. The performances of the modified textile
   fabrics were evaluated for the recovery of Cu(+2) and Cr(+3) from
   aqueous solution. The metal ion absorption efficiency of the modified
   textile fabrics was measured using UV Spectrophotometer analysis and
   EDX. Parameters affecting the efficiency of these textile fabrics in the
   removal of metal ions from aqueous solution namely, concentration of AAc
   and the immersion time were studied. It was found that there was a
   marked increase in the recovery of metal ions on increasing both

Abstract = {{An alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) from okara, a byproduct from soymilk,
   was mainly composed by indigestible carbohydrate (55.7\%). After
   sequential extraction, three alkali-soluble fractions (12.7\% yield) and
   an insoluble residue (RES, 58.7\% yield) were obtained. Soluble
   polysaccharide fractions showed in vitro reduction power (11-26 mu mol
   Trolox Equivalent (TE)/g dry weight (dw)) and free radical scavenging
   activity (63-78 mu mol TE/g dw). The highest antioxidant activity was
   exhibited by 0.05 M NaOH-soluble fraction, rich in pectins. The 1 M
   KOH-soluble fraction had a mixture of hemicellulosic and pectic
   polysaccharides, and 4M KOH-soluble fraction contained the bulk of
   xyloglucans, although some pectins could also be present. RES contained
   cellulose along with residual pectins. FT-IR spectra of okara and AIR
   exhibited an absorption band at 1740 cm(-1) of carboxylic ester from
   pectins, which lacked in the fractions. Moreover, they showed absorption
   bands at 1650 and 1550 cm(-1) of proteins, and at 900-890 cm(-1) of
   beta-glycosidic linkages. Potential antioxidant activity of okara
   cell-wall polysaccharides could be attributed to pectins, although the
   contribution of residual proteins cannot be ruled out. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{Mtmr8 is essential for vasculature development in zebrafish embryos}},
Journal = {{BMC DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Embryonic morphogenesis of vascular and muscular systems is
   tightly coordinated, and a functional cooperation of Mtmr8 with PI3K in
   actin filament modeling and muscle development has been revealed in
   zebrafish. Here, we attempt to explore the function of Mtmr8 in
   vasculature development parallel to its function in muscle development.
   Results: During early stage of somitogenesis, mtmr8 expression was
   detected in both somitic mesodem and ventral mesoderm. Knockdown of
   mtmr8 by morpholino impairs arterial endothelial marker expression, and
   results in endothelial cell reduction and vasculogenesis defects, such
   as retardation in intersegmental vessel development and interruption of
   trunk dorsal aorta. Moreover, mtmr8 morphants show loss of arterial
   endothelial cell identity in dorsal aorta, which is effectively rescued
   by low concentration of PI3K inhibitor, and by over-expression of dnPKA
   mRNA or vegf mRNA. Interestingly, mtmr8 expression is up-regulated when
   zebrafish embryos are treated with specific inhibitor of Hedgehog
   pathway that abolishes arterial marker expression.
   Conclusion: These data indicate that Mtmr8 is essential for vasculature
   development in zebrafish embryos, and may play a role in arterial
   specification through repressing PI3K activity. It is suggested that
   Mtmr8 should represent a novel element of the Hedgehog/PI3K/VEGF
   signaling cascade that controls arterial specification.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrophilic monomer, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and hydrophobic
   monomer, 3-(methacryloyloxy)propyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane (MPTS)
   were grafted on vulcanized rubber surface with simultaneous electron
   beam irradiation. Degree of graft polymerization was evaluated by
   composition ratio of imparted graft chain against trunk rubber. The
   composition ratio could be controlled by the monomer concentration and
   the irradiation dose. Grafted rubbers were evaluated by surface
   roughness and contact angle. Graft polymerization of HEMA decreased the
   contact angle from 93 to similar to 70 degrees without considerable
   change of the surface roughness. In the case of MPTS, the contact angle
   increased approximately to 108 degrees. The relationship between the
   contact angle of water on the modified surface and the friction at the
   moment of semidry was investigated as an application of the resulting
   rubber to wiper blade. The increase of the contact angle owing to the
   grafting of hydrophobic MPTS led to the decrease of Delta mu (deference
   between semi-dry state and dry friction). Instead, the decrease of the
   contact angle by grafting of hydrophilic HEMA resulted in the increase
   of Delta mu. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 117:

   system for predicting the photogenotoxic potential of pharmaceutical
   substances The conditions of the high-throughput IBP assay using
   thiazole orange (TO), a fluorescent intercalating dye, were optimized
   and validated by a fluorescence titration experiment and
   reproducibility/robustness test The IBP assay was applied to 27
   phototoxic and 5 weak/non-phototoxic commercially available compounds,
   and other phototoxicity screenings were also carried out for comparison,
   these included the reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay for overall
   phototoxic potential and the DNA-photocleavage assay for photogenotoxic
   risk According to the results from the comparative experiments, a
   decreased level of intercalated TO in the IBP assay could theoretically
   be related to the DNA-photocleaving behaviors of phototoxic drugs. but
   not to their ROS-generating abilities. The IBP assay could predict the
   photodynamic DNA impairment caused by irradiated drugs with a prediction
   accuracy of 78\% These findings suggest that the IBP assay could be a
   fast and reliable tool for predicting the photogenotoxic potential of a

   follows a sin(6)theta behaviour for ns states, while for np states, it
   is expressed as a combination of sin(4)theta and sin(6)theta. Using the
   implicit summation technique, nine radial transitions matrix elements
   are determined and a quantitative analysis of these coefficients is made
   for 1s, 2s, 3s, 2p and 3p initial states at various wavelengths,
   including the three photons ionization threshold; for linear
   polarization, the shapes are strongly dependent on both quantum numbers
   (n, l); while for circular polarization the shapes remain the same.
   Furthermore, the corresponding total cross sections obtained indirectly
   from these coefficients, are globally in agreement with that obtained
   directly from other methods.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of incorporation of lupine and garden pea on selected soil
   chemical properties and growth of weeds in a potato cropping system was
   evaluated in North Rift, Kenya. The study was carried out in a well
   drained, extremely deep, dusky red to dark reddish brown, friable clay,
   acid humic top soil. Two weeding regimes (at legume incorporation stage
   and/or at 50\% potato flowering stage), three nitrogen levels (0, 60 and
   120 kg N ha(-1)) applied as CAN and two legumes plus a control (garden
   pea, lupine and none) were evaluated in a split-split plot design with
   weeding regimes as the main plots, N as sub-plots and legumes as the
   unit plots. Incorporation of legumes significantly (p < 0.05) raised
   soil pH from 3.6 - 3.9 and to 4.2; increased soil available P from 15
   mg/kg to 25 and to 29 mg/kg for garden pea and lupine, respectively. The
   two legumes interacted with weeding regime and N reducing sheep sorrel
   weed density and biomass. The significantly higher lupine effects were
   attributed to its high biomass production suggesting that legumes may
   best improve soil fertility and reduce soil acidity when incorporated in
   the soil as green manure.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the effects of foliar application of micronutrients
   (iron and zinc) on yield and essential oil of chamomile, two field
   experiments were carried out in 2008 and 2009 at the Research Station of
   Faculty of Agriculture, University of Tabriz, Iran. Both experiments
   were arranged as factorial on the basis of randomized complete block
   design (RCBD) with four replications. Treatments were foliar application
   of micronutrients (Fe, Zn and Fe + Zn through ferrous sulphate and zinc
   sulphate at the concentration of 0.35\%) and time of application (at
   stem elongation, flowering and both stages) with control (without foliar
   application). The results showed that flower yield, essential oil
   percentage, and essential oil yield increased by foliar application of
   Fe and Zn compared with control (untreated). The highest flower yield
   (1963.0 kgha(-1)), essential oil percentage (1.062\%), and essential oil
   yield (20.835 kgha(-1)) were obtained for Fe + Zn spray treatment with
   about 46.4, 24.64, and 81.77\% improvements in comparison with control,
   respectively. The time of foliar application had significant effect on
   flower dry yield, essential oil percentage and essential oil yield. The
   foliar application at both stages of stem elongation and flowering had
   more beneficial effects on these characters as compared with spray at
   only one stage. It seems that foliar application of iron and zinc can
   considerably improve flower yield and essential oil content of chamomile

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Isoniazid (I) is the drug of choice for
   treating latent tuberculous infection (LTI). Duration of treatment with
   I and its liver toxicity represent a serious drawback for a correct
   enforceability. In several clinical guides, a 3-month course with
   rifampicin (Rif) and I is recommended as an acceptable alternative to
   the 6-9 month course with I. Here we present our experience with this
   new regimen.
   Patients and methods: From 2001, the 3-month regimenm with Rif and I was
   offered to patients older than 14 years, who were recruited in the
   contacts study. A good adherence was considered when the patient
   manifested so and he/she went to the scheduled monthly controls. We
   performed baseline liver analyses in those patients at risk of
   hepatotoxicity and in all patients older than 35 years. In all cases, a
   liver laboratory control was done at the first month of treatment and
   whenever patients had symptoms suggestive of intolerance. Databases of
   tuberculosis controls and contacts were crossed to evaluate the number
   of individuals who developed tuberculosis.
   Results: Between 2000 and 2008, treatment for LTI was indicated in 547
   contacts (7.8\% refused treatment, 34.1\% with the 6-month I course,
   63.5\% with the 3-month Rif and I course and 23\% with other regimens).
   A total of 84.97\% (147/173) patients with the 6-month I regimen and
   92.55\% (302/322) with the 3-month Rif and I course fulfilled the
   treatment (p=0,024). 2.37\% (4/169) and 1.6\% (5/313) patients with the
   6-month I course and 3-month Rif and I course, respectively, withdrew
   because of hepatotoxicity (p=0,33). There were no patients among those
   who fulfilled the treatment in any of the 2 study arms.
   Conclusion: There was a higher adherence (statistically significant) and
   lower hepatotoxicity with the 3-month Rif and I regimen. Both regimens
   showed a full effectivity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Espana, S.L All rights

Abstract = {{An ethno-botanical study of traditional medicinal plants used by
   indigenous people in Mekele city, Northern Ethiopia was carried out from
   July - September 2009. Thirteen informants between the ages of 18 and 56
   were randomly selected for the study. Ethno-botanical data were
   collected using semi-structured interview and field observations. The
   routes of administration were oral and dermal with equal proportions.
   The local people utilized 16 medicinal plant species to treat 16 human
   ailments. Most of these plants (62.5\%) were collected from wild
   habitats. Local people depend on both dry and fresh remedies. In this
   case, 10 preparations (62.5\%) were in fresh form and 6 (37.5\%) dried.
   The majority (75\%) of remedy preparations did not have additive
   substances while the remaining has different additive substances like
   honey, sugar, oil and hair of female old sheep for the treatment of
   single ailment. Most (84.6\%) of the traditional healers were found to
   have poor knowledge on the dosage and antidote while prescribing
   remedies to their patients. Majority (84.6\%) of traditional healers
   indicated the absence of any adverse effects of traditional medicines
   after administrations. But some (15.4\%) of the preparations were
   reported to have some adverse effects like vomiting and fever on
   patients. Agricultural expansion, over grazing and lack of awareness are
   major threats to medicinal plants in the study area. It was found that,
   there is little practice of bringing medicinal plants under cultivation.
   It is therefore, recommended that people need to be encouraged to
   cultivate medicinal plants in their home garden. The participation of
   the local people and awareness creation through training or education on
   sustainable utilization and management of plant resources should be
   encouraged.}},

Abstract = {{We present a significant improvement over our previous calculations of
   the cosmic string contribution to cosmic microwave background (CMB)
   power spectra, with particular focus on sub-WMAP angular scales. These
   smaller scales are relevant for the now-operational Planck satellite and
   additional suborbital CMB projects that have even finer resolutions. We
   employ larger Abelian Higgs string simulations than before and we
   additionally model and extrapolate the statistical measures from our
   simulations to smaller length scales. We then use an efficient means of
   including the extrapolations into our Einstein-Boltzmann calculations in
   order to yield accurate results over the multipole range 2 <= l <= 4000.
   Our results suggest that power-law behavior cuts in for l greater than
   or similar to 3000 in the case of the temperature power spectrum, which
   then allows cautious extrapolation to even smaller scales. We find that
   a string contribution to the temperature power spectrum making up 10\%
   of power at l = 10 would be larger than the Silk-damped primary
   adiabatic contribution for l greater than or similar to 3500.
   Astrophysical contributions such as the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect also
   become important at these scales and will reduce the sensitivity to
   strings, but these are potentially distinguishable by their
   frequency-dependence.}},

Abstract = {{Micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) uses surfactant solutions as mobile
   phases with added organic additives to enhance both the elution strength
   and the chromatographic efficiency. Two aliphatic carboxylic acids
   (1-butanoic and 1-pentanoic) were used as MLC additives and compared
   with the two corresponding alcohols (1-butanol, 1-pentanol) in terms of
   elution strength, efficiency and selectivity. A set of 11 phenol
   derivatives was used as probe compounds. All micellar mobile phases were
   prepared with sodium dodecylsulfate (SOS) with concentration ranging
   from 0.05 to 0.15 M and the modifier content within 1.0 and 5.0\% (v/v).
   The elution strength of different mobile phases containing a constant
   amount of SDS and different amounts of modifiers; and mobile phases
   containing a constant amount of modifier and different SDS concentration
   were determined and discussed. The effect of the acid modifiers on
   efficiency was studied constructing van Deemter plots that showed no
   minimum within the 0.01-0.7 mL/min flow rate range studied. Temperature
   effects were also studied constructing the classical van't Hoff plots.
   The slight curvature of the plots in the 25-70 degrees C range may
   indicate some modification of the surfactant-bonded moiety layer on the
   stationary phase surface. Since no definitive advantage of the use of
   aliphatic acids were established compared to their alcohol counterpart,
   their terrible smell will probably preclude their use as MLC organic
   modifiers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) has produced an extensive
   collection of `-omic' data on glioblastoma (GBM), resulting in several
   key insights on expression signatures. Despite the richness of TCGA GBM
   data, the absence of lower grade gliomas in this data set prevents
   analysis genes related to progression and the uncovering of predictive
   signatures. A complementary dataset exists in the form of the NCI
   Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (Rembrandt), which
   contains molecular and clinical data for diffuse gliomas across the full
   spectrum of histologic class and grade. Here we present an investigation
   of the significance of the TCGA consortium's expression classification
   when applied to Rembrandt gliomas. We demonstrate that the proneural
   signature predicts improved clinical outcome among 176 Rembrandt gliomas
   that includes all histologies and grades, including GBMs (log rank test
   p = 1.16e-6), but also among 75 grade II and grade III samples (p =
   2.65e-4). This gene expression signature was enriched in tumors with
   oligodendroglioma histology and also predicted improved survival in this
   tumor type (n = 43, p = 1.25e-4). Thus, expression signatures identified
   in the TCGA analysis of GBMs also have intrinsic prognostic value for
   lower grade oligodendrogliomas, and likely represent important
   differences in tumor biology with implications for treatment and
   therapy. Integrated DNA and RNA analysis of low-grade and high-grade
   proneural gliomas identified increased expression and gene amplification
   of several genes including GLIS3, TGFB2, TNC, AURKA, and VEGFA in
   proneural GBMs, with corresponding loss of DLL3 and HEY2. Pathway
   analysis highlights the importance of the Notch and Hedgehog pathways in
   the proneural subtype. This demonstrates that the expression signatures
   identified in the TCGA analysis of GBMs also have intrinsic prognostic
   value for low-grade oligodendrogliomas, and likely represent important
   differences in tumor biology with implications for treatment and
   therapy.}},

Abstract = {{A phthalylated ion-exchange biopolymer was obtained by adding cellulose
   to molten phthalic anhydride in a quasi solvent-free procedure. Through
   this route 2.99 +/- 0.07 mmol g(-1) of pendant groups containing ester
   and carboxylic acid moieties were incorporated into the polymeric
   structure that was characterized by elemental analysis, solid-state
   carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS), infrared spectroscopy, X-ray
   diffraction, and thermogravimetry. The chemically modified
   polysaccharide is able to exchange cations from aqueous solution as
   demonstrated by batchwise methodology. The data were adjusted to a
   modified Langmuir equation to give 2.43 +/- 0.12 and 2.26 +/- 0.11 mmol
   g(-1) for divalent cobalt and nickel cations, respectively. The net
   thermal effects obtained from calorimetric titration measurements were
   also adjusted to a modified Langmuir equation, and the enthalpy of the
   interaction was calculated to give endothermic values of 2.11 +/- 0.28
   and 2.50 +/- 0.31 kJ mol(-1) for these cations, respectively. The
   spontaneity of this ion-exchange process is reflected in negative Gibbs
   energy and with a contribution of positive entropic values. This set of
   thermodynamic data at the solid-liquid interface suggests a favorable
   ion-exchange process for this anchored biopolymer for cation exchange
   from the environment. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{During retroviral RNA packaging, two copies of genomic RNA are
   preferentially packaged into the budding virus particles whereas the
   spliced viral RNAs and the cellular RNAs are excluded during this
   process. Specificity towards retroviral RNA packaging is dependent upon
   sequences at the 5' end of the viral genome, which at times extend into
   Gag sequences. It has earlier been suggested that the Mason Pfizer
   monkey virus (MPMV) contains packaging sequences within the 5'
   untranslated region (UTR) and Gag. These studies have also suggested
   that the packaging determinants of MPMV that lie in the UTR are
   bipartite and are divided into two regions both upstream and downstream
   of the major splice donor. However, the precise boundaries of these
   discontinuous regions within the UTR and the role of the intervening
   sequences between these dipartite sequences towards MPMV packaging have
   not been investigated. Employing a combination of genetic and structural
   prediction analyses, we have shown that region ``A{''}, immediately
   downstream of the primer binding site, is composed of 50 nt, whereas
   region ``B{''} is composed of the last 23 nt of UTR, and the intervening
   55 nt between these two discontinuous regions do not contribute towards
   MPMV RNA packaging. In addition, we have identified a 14-nt G-C-rich
   palindromic sequence (with 100\% autocomplementarity) within region A
   that has been predicted to fold into a structural motif and is essential
   for optimal MPMV RNA packaging. Furthermore, we have also identified a
   stretch of single-stranded purines (ssPurines) within the UTR and 8 nt
   of these ssPurines are duplicated in region B. The native ssPurines or
   its repeat in region B when predicted to refold as ssPurines has been
   shown to be essential for RNA packaging, possibly functioning as a
   potential nucleocapsid binding site. Findings from this study should
   enhance our understanding of the steps involved in MPMV replication
   including RNA encapsidation process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recurrent and episodic depletions of ozone (O-3) in the atmospheric
   boundary layer have been observed at arctic coastal sites during
   springtime for the past 25 years. Additional measurements from the
   central Arctic Ocean in April 2003 and 2007 confirm previous
   observations in 1994 indicating that low (<5 nmol mol(-1)) O-3 levels
   most likely represent the normal state of the boundary layer of the
   Arctic Ocean in springtime. Ozone mixing ratios increase sporadically to
   typical remote background values only during the approach of lows moving
   northward into the central Arctic from midlatitudes, bringing O-3-rich
   air into the Arctic basin. During a vast majority of the observed O-3
   transitions related to the influence of lows, O-3 mixing ratios are
   strongly negatively correlated to atmospheric pressure. This negative
   correlation is generally stronger than the correlation between O-3
   mixing ratios and air temperature. The observations indicate that the
   stable boundary layer, which is a large-scale feature of the Arctic
   Ocean in springtime, may regularly be void of O-3 implying a shift to
   halogen radicals as the major oxidizing agent on the same spatial scale.
   The removal of O-3 in the boundary layer on such a large scale may
   contribute to a reduction of the warming caused by tropospheric O-3 in
   the Arctic, although the overall impact on the radiation budget is
   currently unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Recently Gierlotka {[}Journal of Alloys and Compounds 494 (1-2) (2010)
   102-108] reported on thermodynamic assessments of the Hg-Te binary
   system using (1) two-sublattice ionic model, (2) associate model, and
   (3) random mixing model for the liquid phase. And a conclusion was made
   such that the two-sublattice ionic model and the associate model are
   superior to the random mixing model in describing thermodynamic
   properties and phase diagram of the Hg-Te system, and the two-sublattice
   ionic model seems to be more suitable for describing Hg-Te binary system
   due to ionic behavior of the Hg-Te liquid. Purpose of the present letter
   is to point out that (1) the two-sublattice ionic model and the
   associate model can be made mathematically the same in a binary system
   as in the Hg-Te system, therefore two different assessments using either
   the two-sublattice ionic model or the associate model by Gierlotka are
   essentially very similar as long as the parameters used in both models
   are similar, and (2) the two models can also be made mathematically
   equivalent even in higher order system under certain conditions. (C)

Title = {{Wound contraction effects and antibacterial properties of Tualang honey
   on full-thickness burn wounds in rats in comparison to hydrofibre}},
Journal = {{BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Full-thickness burn wounds require excision and skin
   grafting. Multiple surgical procedures are inevitable in managing
   moderate to severe full-thickness burns. Wound bed preparations prior to
   surgery are necessary in order to prevent wound infection and promote
   wound healing. Honey can be used to treat burn wounds. However, not all
   the honey is the same. This study aims to evaluate the wound contraction
   and antibacterial properties of locally-produced Tualang honey on
   managing full-thickness burn wounds in vivo.
   Methods: Thirty-six female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided
   into three groups. Under anaesthesia, three full-thickness burn wounds
   were created on the dorsum of the rats. The full-thickness burn wounds
   were inoculated with a specific organism (104), namely Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa (n = 12), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 12), or Acinetobacter
   baumannii (n = 12). The three burn wounds were dressed with Tualang
   honey, hydrofibre and hydrofibre silver respectively. Swab samples were
   obtained every 3 days (day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21) for quantitative
   and semi-quantitative microbiological analyses. Clinical assessments,
   including observations concerning the appearance and wound size, were
   measured at the same time.
   Results: There was a rapid 32.26\% reduction in wound size by day 6 (p =
   0.008) in the Tualang honey-treated wounds, and 49.27\% by day 15 (p =
   0.005). The wounds remained smaller by day 18 (p < 0.032). Tualang
   honey-treated rats demonstrated a reduction in bacterial growth in
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa inoculated wounds (p = 0.005). However,
   hydrofibre silver and hydrofibre-treated wounds are superior to
   honey-treated wounds with Acinetobacter baumannii (p = 0.035). There was
   no statistical significant of antibacterial property in Klebsiella
   pneumonia inoculated wounds.
   Conclusions: Tualang honey has better results with regards to its
   control of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its wound contraction effects on
   full-thickness burn wound in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{A new low temperature synthetic route to binary and ternary metal
   antimonides is reported. Binary transition metal antimonides prepared
   include CoSb3, CoSb2, CoSb, NiSb, NiSb2, Cu2Sb and Mo3Sb2; new ternary
   compositions prepared include the series Co1-xNixSb (0.1 <= x <= 0.9).
   The intermetallic SnSb has also been prepared by this route. The
   synthetic method is simple and does not require the use of very high
   temperatures, multi-step reactions or reaction under vacuum. Compounds
   were synthesised by the reduction of mixed metal oxides under 10\%
   hydrogen in argon at moderate temperatures (approx. 450 degrees C). The
   route affords some control over the stoichiometry of the product. High
   purity binary phases formed include CoSb3, CoSb, NiSb, Cu2Sb and SnSb.
   Owing to the significantly different reduction temperatures of the
   starting metal oxides, Mo3Sb2 was formed with impurities of MoO2 and Sb
   metal. CoSb2 and NiSb2 were formed with impurities of CoSb3 and NiSb2
   respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of a luminescent quantum cluster (QC) of gold with a
   quantum yield of similar to 4\% is reported. It was synthesized in gram
   quantities by the core etching of mercaptosuccinic acid protected gold
   nanoparticles by bovine serum albumin (BSA), abbreviated as Au-QC@BSA.
   The cluster was characterized and a core of Au-38 was assigned
   tentatively from mass spectrometric analysis. Luminescence of the QC is
   exploited as a ``turn-off{''} sensor for Cu2+ ions and a ``turn-on{''}
   sensor for glutathione detection. Metal-enhanced luminescence (MEL) of
   this QC in the presence of silver nanoparticles is demonstrated and a
   ninefold maximum enhancement is seen. This is the first report of the
   observation of MEL from QCs. Folic acid conjugated Au-QC@BSA was found
   to be internalized to a significant extent by oral carcinoma KB cells
   through folic acid mediated endocytosis. The inherent luminescence of
   the internalized Au-QC@BSA was used in cell imaging.}},

Title = {{Insomnia and its correlates in a representative sample of the Greek
   population}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Insomnia is a major public health concern affecting about
   10\% of the general population in its chronic form. Furthermore,
   epidemiological surveys demonstrate that poor sleep and sleep
   dissatisfaction are even more frequent problems (10-48\%) in the
   community. This is the first report on the prevalence of insomnia in
   Greece, a southeastern European country which differs in several
   socio-cultural and climatic aspects from the rest of European Community
   members. Data obtained from a national household survey (n = 1005) were
   used to assess the relationship between insomnia symptoms and a variety
   of sociodemographic variables, life habits, and health-related factors.
   Methods: A self-administered questionnaire with questions pertaining to
   general health and related issues was given to the participants. The
   Short Form-36 (Mental Health subscale), the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS)
   as a measure of insomnia-related symptoms, and the International
   Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) were also used for the
   assessment.
   Results: The prevalence of insomnia in the total sample was 25.3\% (n =
   254); insomnia was more frequent in women than men (30.7\% vs. 19.5\%)
   and increased with age. Multiple regression analysis revealed a
   significant association of insomnia with low socio-economical status and
   educational level, physical inactivity, existence of a chronic physical
   or mental disease and increased number of hospitalizations in the
   previous year.
   Conclusions: The present study confirms most findings reported from
   other developed countries around the world regarding the high prevalence
   of insomnia problems in the general population and their association
   with several sociodemographic and health-related predisposing factors.
   These results further indicate the need for more active interventions on
   the part of physicians who should suspect and specifically ask about
   such symptoms.}},

   case study}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{We present an efficient method of reconstructing the parameters of the
   constrained MSSM from assumed future LHC data, applied both on their own
   right and in combination with the cosmological determination of the
   relic dark matter abundance. Focusing on the ATLAS SU3 benchmark point,
   we demonstrate that our simple Gaussian approximation can recover the
   values of its parameters remarkably well. We examine two popular
   noninformative priors and obtain very similar results, although when we
   use an informative, naturalness-motivated prior, we find some sizeable
   differences. We show that a further strong improvement in reconstructing
   the SU3 parameters can by achieved by applying additional information
   about the relic abundance at the level of WMAP accuracy, although the
   expected data from Planck will have only a very limited additional
   impact. Further external data may be required to break some remaining
   degeneracies. We argue that the method presented here is applicable to a
   wide class of low-energy effective supersymmetric models, as it does not
   require one to deal with purely experimental issues, e.g., detector
   performance, and has the additional advantages of computational
   efficiency. Furthermore, our approach allows one to distinguish the
   effect of the model's internal structure and of the external data on the
   final parameters constraints.}},

Abstract = {{A series of partially fluorinated poly(arylene ether)s with systematical
   structure variations (variations in the (bi)phenylene, bisphenol moiety,
   and the fluorine content) was synthesized and characterized Main
   objective of this contribution was the investigation of
   structure-property relationships of the different polymer structures,
   and how the chemical structure of the aromatic monomers influences (1)
   polymerisability of the monomers; (2) chemical and thermal stability of
   the poly(arylene ether)s, and (3) properties of the referring sulfonated
   polymers, particularly their chemical and mechanical stability Polymers
   from this series comprising high molecular weight and excellent
   film-forming properties were targeted to various sulfonation routes, and
   their degradation behavior during sulfonation was investigated by gel
   permeation chromatography (GPC) Finally, (polybenzimidazole blend)
   membrane properties of the most promising candidates for potential
   application in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells were evaluated.
   The best of the investigated blend membranes was investigated in an
   air-breathing DMFC and yielded markedly improved performance, compared
   to Nafion (R) 105. This study gives both insight into

Abstract = {{Meiosis is a cellular differentiation process in which hundreds of genes
   are temporally induced. Because the expression of meiotic genes during
   mitosis is detrimental to proliferation, meiotic genes must be
   negatively regulated in the mitotic cell cycle. Yet, little is known
   about mechanisms used by mitotic cells to repress meiosis-specific
   genes. Here we show that the poly(A)binding protein Pab2, the fission
   yeast homolog of mammalian PABPN1, controls the expression of several
   meiotic transcripts during mitotic division. Our results from chromatin
   immunoprecipitation and promoter-swapping experiments indicate that Pab2
   controls meiotic genes post-transcriptionally. Consistently, we show
   that the nuclear exosome complex cooperates with Pab2 in the negative
   regulation of meiotic genes. We also found that Pab2 plays a role in the
   RNA decay pathway orchestrated by Mmi1, a previously described factor
   that functions in the post-transcriptional elimination of meiotic
   transcripts. Our results support a model in which Mmi1 selectively
   targets meiotic transcripts for degradation via Pab2 and the exosome.
   Our findings have therefore uncovered a mode of gene regulation whereby
   a poly(A)-binding protein promotes RNA degradation in the nucleus to
   prevent untimely expression.}},

Abstract = {{The catalytic oxidation of alcohols with molecular oxygen on supported
   nanometallic catalysts represents one of the green methods in a crucial
   process for the synthesis of fine chemicals. We have designed an
   experiment using physically mixed Au/AC and Pd/AC (AC=activated carbon)
   as the catalyst in the liquid-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol by
   aerobic oxygen. The evolution of the physically mixed catalyst
   structures at different stages in the catalytic reaction was
   investigated by aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy and spatially resolved element mapping techniques at
   the nanometre scale, and they were also compared with the structure of
   the bimetallic alloy. For the first time we show the formation of
   surface Au-Pd bimetallic sites by reprecipitation of Pd onto Au
   nanoparticles. Negligible Au leaching was observed. The in situ
   structural evolution can be directly correlated to the great enhancement
   of the catalyst activity. Moreover, we distinguish the different
   behaviours of Au and Pd, thus suggesting an oxygen differentiating
   mechanism for Au and Pd sites. The findings are of great importance to
   both the understanding of the structure-activity correlation and the
   design of highly active catalysts in green chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{A new microsporidian infecting the Mediterranean common stingray
   Dasyatis pastinaca (Linnaeus, 1758) is described from Iskenderun Bay,
   Turkey. The parasite invades the disc muscles, producing slender,
   spindle-shaped subcutaneous swellings that develop into massive,
   elongated, tumor-like protuberances measuring up to 11 x 4 cm. Severity
   of the infection may vary from light (1 or 2 small lesions) to intense,
   with large parts of the dorsal surface covered with lumps and
   protrusions. These masses contained a yellowish-white caseous substance
   consisting of degraded host tissue and microsporidian sporophorous
   vesicles, which in turn contained developing sporonts, sporoblasts and
   spores. The ripe spore contained a uni-nucleate sporoplasm and large
   posterior vacuole, and measured 3.8-4.3 x 2.6-2.8 mu m. Infection
   prevalence was 21\% in a sample of 143 host individuals examined. All
   the infected stingray individuals were within the weight class of 300 to
   800 g (200 to 305 mm disc width). Phylogenetic analyses of rDNA
   sequences indicate that this microsporidian belongs to the
   Pleistophoridae and clusters with species of the genera Ovipleistophora
   Pekkarinen, Lom \& Nilsen, 2002 and Heterosporis Schubert, 1969.
   However, the morphology, development and host differ distinctly from all
   reported species, including those belonging to these 2 genera, and it is
   thus assigned to a newly erected genus and named Dasyatispora levantinae
   gen. et sp. nov. This is the first record of a microsporidian infection
   in a batoid. It is also the first microsporidian species to be formally
   described from an elasmobranch.}},

Abstract = {{In gaseous or surface reactions, ``early{''} barriers along the reaction
   coordinate are commonly surmounted by reagent translation, and
   ``late{''} barriers are surmounted by vibration. Here, we link barrier
   location to the separation of the reaction products (2H or H + Cl)
   following dissociative attachment of H-2 and HCl at silicon. Two
   markedly different approximations are used to represent Si(100)-2 x 1, a
   pair of silyl radicals and a cluster of 53 silicon atoms. In both
   approximations, the crest of the energy barrier is found to be located
   early along the reaction coordinate for attachment at neighboring
   silicon atoms and late for attachment at more widely separated silicons.
   This suggests a means for steering reaction by reagent translation or
   vibration, to give dissociative attachment at closer or further
   separations on a surface.}},

   p24-Specific T Cell Responses}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Background: The development of an HIV/AIDS vaccine has proven to be
   elusive. Because human vaccine trials have not yet demonstrated
   efficacy, new vaccine strategies are needed for the HIV vaccine
   pipeline. We have been developing a new HIV vaccine platform using a
   live enterovirus, coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) vector. Enteroviruses are
   ideal candidates for development as a vaccine vector for oral delivery,
   because these viruses normally enter the body via the oral route and
   survive the acidic environment of the stomach.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We constructed a live coxsackievirus B4
   recombinant, CVB4/p24(73(3)), that expresses seventy-three amino acids
   of the gag p24 sequence (HXB2) and assessed T cell responses after
   immunization of mice. The CVB4 recombinant was physically stable,
   replication-competent, and genetically stable. Oral or intraperitoneal
   immunization with the recombinant resulted in strong systemic gag
   p24-specific T cell responses as determined by the IFN-gamma ELISPOT
   assay and by multiparameter flow cytometry. Oral immunization with
   CVB4/p24(73(3)) resulted in a short-lived, localized infection of the
   gut without systemic spread. Because coxsackieviruses are ubiquitous in
   the human population, we also evaluated whether the recombinant was able
   to induce gag p24-specific T cell responses in mice pre-immunized with
   the CVB4 vector. We showed that oral immunization with CVB4/p24(73(3))
   induced gag p24-specific immune responses in vector-immune mice.
   Conclusions/Significance: The CVB4/p24(73(3)) recombinant retained the
   physical and biological characteristics of the parental CVB4 vector.
   Oral immunization with the CVB4 recombinant was safe and resulted in the
   induction of systemic HIV-specific T cell responses. Furthermore,
   pre-existing vector immunity did not preclude the development of gag
   p24-specific T cell responses. As the search continues for new vaccine
   strategies, the present study suggests that live CVB4/HIV recombinants
   are potential new vaccine candidates for HIV.}},

Title = {{Prevalence of common thrombophilia markers and risk factors in Indian

Journal = {{SAO PAULO MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{263-267}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Venous thrombosis occurs as a result of
   interaction of genetic and acquired factors including activated protein
   C resistance (APC-R), fibrinogen levels, antithrombin, protein C,
   protein S, lupus anticoagulants and anticardiolipin antibodies. This
   study was aimed at determining the prevalence of these common
   thrombophilia markers in Asian Indians with primary venous thrombosis.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in
   Mumbai.
   METHODS: Samples from 78 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of venous
   thrombosis and 50 controls were tested. Semi-quantitative estimation
   (functional assays) of protein C, protein S and antithrombin was
   performed. Quantitative estimation of fibrinogen was done using the
   Clauss method. Lupus anticoagulants were screened using lupus-sensitive
   activated partial thromboplastin time and beta 2-glycoprotein-I
   dependent anticardiolipin antibodies were estimated by ELISA. APC-R was
   measured using a clotting-based method with factor V deficient plasma
   and Crotalus viridis venom. Statistical analysis was performed using
   Epi-info (version 6).
   RESULTS: The popliteal vein was the most commonly involved site.
   Forty-four samples (56\%) gave abnormal results. The commonest were
   elevated fibrinogen and APC-R (17.9\% each), followed by low protein S
   (16.6\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the literature findings that fibrinogen
   level estimation and screening for APC-R are important for the work-up
   on venous thrombosis patients since these, singly or in combination, may
   lead to a primary thrombotic episode. The frequency of the other
   thrombophilia markers was higher among the patients than among the
   controls, but without statistically significant difference.}},

Abstract = {{Photostability, inherent fluorescence brightness, and optical modulation
   of fluorescence are key attributes distinguishing silver nanoclusters as
   fluorophores. DNA plays a central role both by protecting the clusters
   in aqueous environments and by directing their formation. Herein, we
   characterize a new near-infrared-emitting cluster with excitation and
   emission maxima at 750 and 810 nm, respectively, that is stabilized
   within C(3)AC(3)AC(3)TC(3)A. Following chromatographic resolution of the
   near-infrared species, a stoichiometry of 10 Ag/oligonucleotide was
   determined. Combined with excellent photostability, the cluster's 30\%
   fluorescence quantum yield and 180 000 M-1 cm(-1) extinction coefficient
   give it a fluorescence brightness that significantly improves on that of
   the Organic dye Cy7. Fluorescence correlation analysis shows an
   optically accessible dark state that can be directly depopulated with
   longer wavelength coillumination. The coupled increase in total
   fluorescence demonstrates that enhanced sensitivity can be realized
   through Synchronously Amplified Fluorescence Image Recovery (SAFIRe),
   which further differentiates this new fluorophore.}},

Abstract = {{Defining the molecular mechanisms underpinning fetal (gamma) globin gene
   silencing may provide strategies for reactivation of gamma-gene
   expression, a major therapeutic objective in patients with
   beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). We have previously
   demonstrated that symmetric methylation of histone H4 Arginine 3
   (H4R3me2s) by the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 is required
   for recruitment of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A to the
   gamma-promoter, and subsequent DNA methylation and gene silencing. Here
   we show in an erythroid cell line, and in primary adult erythroid
   progenitors that PRMT5 induces additional repressive epigenetic marks at
   the gamma-promoter through the assembly of a multiprotein repressor
   complex containing the histone modifying enzymes SUV4-20h1, casein
   kinase 2 alpha (CK2 alpha), and components of the nucleosome remodeling
   and histone deacetylation complex. Expression of a mutant form of PRMT5
   lacking methyltransferase activity or shRNA-mediated knockdown of
   SUV4-20h1 resulted in loss of complex binding to the gamma-promoter,
   reversal of both histone and DNA repressive epigenetic marks, and
   increased gamma-gene expression. The repressive H4K20me3 mark induced by
   SUV4-20h1 is enriched on the gamma-promoter in erythroid progenitors
   from adult bone marrow compared with cord blood, suggesting
   developmental specificity. These studies define coordinated epigenetic
   events linked to fetal globin gene silencing, and provide potential
   therapeutic targets for the treatment of beta-thalassemia and SCD.

Title = {{Structural and electronic properties of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0 0 0

Abstract = {{Graphene, a monoatomic layer of graphite, hosts a two-dimensional
   electron gas system with large electron mobilities which makes it a
   prospective candidate for future carbon nanodevices. Grown epitaxially
   on silicon carbide (SiC) wafers, large area graphene samples appear
   feasible and integration in existing device technology can be
   envisioned. This paper reviews the controlled growth of epitaxial
   graphene layers on SiC(0 0 0 1) and the manipulation of their electronic
   structure. We show that epitaxial graphene on SiC grows on top of a
   carbon interface layer that-although it has a graphite-like atomic
   structure-does not display the linear pi-bands typical for graphene due
   to a strong covalent bonding to the substrate. Only the second carbon
   layer on top of this interface acts like monolayer graphene. With a
   further carbon layer, a graphene bilayer system develops. During the
   growth of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0 0 0 1) the number of graphene
   layers can be precisely controlled by monitoring the pi-band structure.
   Experimental fingerprints for in situ growth control could be
   established. However, due to the influence of the interface layer,
   epitaxial graphene on SiC(0 0 0 1) is intrinsically n-doped and the
   layers have a long-range corrugation in their density of states. As a
   result, the Dirac point energy where the pi-bands cross is shifted away
   from the Fermi energy, so that the ambipolar properties of graphene
   cannot be exploited. We demonstrate methods to compensate and eliminate
   this structural and electronic influence of the interface. We show that
   the band structure of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0 0 0 1) can be
   precisely tailored by functionalizing the graphene surface with
   tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) molecules. Charge
   neutrality can be achieved for mono-and bilayer graphene. On epitaxial
   bilayer graphene, where a band gap opens due to the asymmetric electric
   field across the layers imposed by the interface, the magnitude of this
   band gap can be increased up to more than double its initial value. The
   hole doping allows the Fermi level to shift into the energy band gap.
   The impact of the interface layer can be completely eliminated by
   decoupling the graphene from the SiC substrate by a hydrogen
   intercalation technique. We demonstrate that hydrogen can migrate under
   the interface layer and passivate the underlying SiC substrate. The
   interface layer alone transforms into a quasi-free standing monolayer.
   Epitaxial monolayer graphene turns into a decoupled bilayer. In
   combination with atmospheric pressure graphitization, the intercalation
   process allows the production of quasi-free standing epitaxial graphene
   on large SiC wafers and represents a highly promising route towards
   epitaxial graphene based nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To describe and evaluate the implementation and adoption of
   detailed electronic health records in secondary care in England and
   thereby provide early feedback for the ongoing local and national
   rollout of the NHS Care Records Service.
   Design A mixed methods, longitudinal, multisite, socio-technical case
   study.
   Setting Five NHS acute hospital and mental health trusts that have been
   the focus of early implementation efforts and at which interim data
   collection and analysis are complete.
   Data sources and analysis Dataset for the evaluation consists of
   semi-structured interviews, documents and field notes, observations, and
   quantitative data. Qualitative data were analysed thematically with a
   socio-technical coding matrix, combined with additional themes that
   emerged from the data.
   Main results Hospital electronic health record applications are being
   developed and implemented far more slowly than was originally
   envisioned; the top-down, standardised approach has needed to evolve to
   admit more variation and greater local choice, which hospital trusts
   want in order to support local activity. Despite considerable delays and
   frustrations, support for electronic health records remains strong,
   including from NHS clinicians. Political and financial factors are now
   perceived to threaten nationwide implementation of electronic health
   records. Interviewees identified a range of consequences of long term,
   centrally negotiated contracts to deliver the NHS Care Records Service
   in secondary care, particularly as NHS trusts themselves are not party
   to these contracts. These include convoluted communication channels
   between different stakeholders, unrealistic deployment timelines,
   delays, and applications that could not quickly respond to changing
   national and local NHS priorities. Our data suggest support for a
   ``middle-out{''} approach to implementing hospital electronic health
   records, combining government direction with increased local autonomy,
   and for restricting detailed electronic health record sharing to local
   health communities.
   Conclusions Experiences from the early implementation sites, which have
   received considerable attention, financial investment and support,
   indicate that delivering improved healthcare through nationwide
   electronic health records will be a long, complex, and iterative process
   requiring flexibility and local adaptability both with respect to the
   systems and the implementation strategy. The more tailored, responsive
   approach that is emerging is becoming better aligned with NHS
   organisations' perceived needs and is, if pursued, likely to deliver
   clinically useful electronic health record systems.}},

Abstract = {{Solvent effects on the spectroscopic and photophysical properties of
   tris\{{[}p-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenylethynyL]duryl)borane (TMAB) and
   tris{[}(phenylethynyl)duryl]borane (TPhB) were studied in detail. Both
   TMAB and TPhB exhibited broad and structureless absorption and
   fluorescence bands ascribed to the charge transfer (CT) transition
   between the pi-orbital of the aryl group (pi(aryl)) and the vacant
   p-orbital on the boron atom (p(B)): pi(aryl)-p(B) CT. The fluorescence
   spectra of TMAB and TPhB were dependent on a solvent polarity, and the
   Stokes shifts of the compounds (Delta v(s)) were shown to correlate
   linearly with a solvent polarity parameter: f(X) = (D-s - 1)/(2D(s) + 1)
   (n(2) - 1)/(2n(2) + 1) where D-s and n are the dielectric constant and
   refractive index of a solvent, respectively. The slope value of the
   Delta v(s) versus f(X) plot gave the excited singlet state dipole moment
   of TMAB or TPhB to be similar to 60 or similar to 30 D, respectively,
   demonstrating that the excited singlet state of TMAB possessed an
   extremely large dipole moment. The fluorescence quantum yields (Phi(f))
   and lifetimes (tau(f)) of the compounds were also dependent on f(X).
   Detailed analysis of the present results demonstrated that the
   photophysical properties of TMAB were governed by the magnitude of the
   fluorescence rate constant (k(f)) and the k(f) value decreased almost
   one-tenth with an increase in f(X), which was the primary origin of the
   f(X) dependences of Phi(f) and tau(f). The results were discussed in
   terms of the characteristic pi(aryl)p(B) CT excited states of the
   derivatives.}},

Title = {{Cytogenetic aberrations and their prognostic value in a series of 330

Abstract = {{We conducted a retrospective collaborative study to cytogenetically
   characterize splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) and ascertain the
   prognostic value of chromosomal aberrations. Of 330 cases, 72\%
   displayed an aberrant karyotype, 53\% were complex, and 29\% had a
   single aberration. The predominant aberrations were gains of 3/3q and
   12q, deletions of 7q and 6q and translocations involving 8q/1q/14q. CD5
   expression was detected in 39 of 158 cases (25\%). The cytogenetic
   makeup of the CD5(+) group differed significantly from that of the
   CD5(-) group. Cases with unmutated IGHV were significantly associated
   with deletions of 7q and TP53. A strong association was noted between
   usage of the IGVH1-2 and deletion 7q, 14q alterations, and abnormal
   karyotype. On univariate analysis, patients with more than or equal to 2
   aberrations, 14q alterations, and TP53 deletions had the shortest
   survival; 7q deletion did not affect survival. On multivariate analysis,
   cytogenetic aberrations did not retain prognostic significance; the
   parameters negatively affecting survival were hemoglobin and age. In
   conclusion, the cytogenetic profile of SMZL is distinct from other
   B-cell lymphomas. Complexity of the karyotype, 14q aberrations, and TP53
   deletions are poor prognostic indicators and may be considered together
   with other clinicobiologic parameters to ascertain the prognosis of
   SMZL. (Blood. 2010;116(9):1479-1488)}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3, 1}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{Currently, simulation is usually used to estimate network degree
   distribution P(k) and to examine if a network model predicts a
   scale-free network when an analytical formula does not exist. An
   alternative Markovian chain-based numerical method was proposed by Shi
   et al. {[}Phys. Rev. E 71, 036140(2005)] to compute time-dependent
   degree distribution P(k,t). Although the numerical results demonstrate a
   quick convergence of P(k,t) to P(k) for the Barabasi-Albert model, the
   crucial issue on the rate of convergence has not been addressed
   formally. In this paper, we propose a simpler Markovian iterative method
   to compute P(k,t) for a class of growing network models. We also provide
   an upper bound estimation of the error of using P(k,t) to represent P(k)
   for sufficiently large t, and we show that with the iterative method,
   the rate of convergence of P(k,t) is root linear.}},

   prepared. These nanorods and nanoparticles were reduced to metallic
   copper at elevated temperature by 4\% H-2 diluted in helium. The
   morphology of CuO nanomaterials (nanorods and nanoparticles) was
   preserved after reduction. These CuO and Cu nanorods and nanoparticles
   were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, SEM-EDS, and BET measurements. The
   CuO and Cu nanomaterials were employed for near-infrared (NIR) diffuse
   reflectance. Among these materials, CuO nanorods were to be found the
   best NIR diffuse reflectors, indicating potential application as NIR

Abstract = {{Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is an unstable compound at room temperature, and
   it has been involved in two tragic industrial incidents. Although
   experimental studies have been carried out to study the thermal
   stability of hydroxylamine, the detailed decomposition mechanism is
   still in debate. In this work, several density functional and ab initio
   methods were used in conjunction with several basis sets to investigate
   the initial thermal decomposition steps of hydroxylamine, including both
   unimolecular and bimolecular reaction pathways. The theoretical
   investigation shows that simple bond dissociations and unimolecular
   reactions are unlikely to occur. The energetically favorable initial
   step of decomposition pathways was determined as a bimolecular
   isomerization of hydroxylamine into ammonia oxide with an activation
   barrier of similar to 25 kcal/mol at the MPW1K level of theory. Because
   hydroxylamine is available only in aqueous solutions, solvent effects on
   the initial decomposition pathways were also studied using water cluster
   methods and the polarizable continuum model (PCM). In water, the
   activation barrier of the bimolecular isomerization reaction decreases
   to similar to 16 kcal/mol. The results indicate that the bimolecular
   isomerization pathway of hydroxylamine is more favorable in aqueous
   solutions. However, the bimolecular nature of this reaction means that
   more dilute aqueous solution will be more stable.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand the dependence of photoinduced initial processes
   on thermal annealing, the femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence
   dynamics of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) in (thermally)
   annealed P3HT/{[}6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blend
   films has been studied by using the fluorescence up-conversion
   technique. For comparison, a P3HT solution, pristine P3HT, and
   unannealed P3HT/PCBM blend films have been investigated as well. The
   fluorescence dynamics of the P3HT solution showed wavelength dependence.
   Excitation energy transfer between the segments and torsional relaxation
   possibly occurred in a time scale of several ps in the solution.
   Observed rise times at longer wavelength emission suggested the
   formation of these relatively lower emission states (at 650 and 700 nm).
   Charge transfer (or excitonic quenching) was the dominant process in the
   fs time scale with emission at 650 nm in the unannealed blend film. In
   the annealed blend film, the charge transfer (334 fs) and downhill
   relaxation (942 fs) of self-trapped (dynamic localized) excitons were
   competitive processes due to the well aligned nanodomains in the
   P3HT/PCBM blend films. There were different charge transfer rates at
   different excited states (650 and 700 nm) in the annealed film. The
   charge transfer process occurred faster at a lower excited state, and a
   stronger electronic and vibrational coupling in the annealed P3HT/PCBM
   films was revealed within these measurements as well. The ultrafast
   anisotropy decays suggested that a strong and ultrafast reorientation of
   the molecular dipole moments occurred at excited states. The anisotropy
   decay was mainly determined by the ultrafast process, whereas the energy
   could continuously migrate along or between P3HT chains in a time scale
   of similar to 100 ps. The ultrafast process suggested that there was an
   excitation delocalization associated with vibrational modes, as was
   consistent with the observation from steady-state measurements. On the
   basis of the understanding of the mechanisms above, the optimized cell
   performance has been established.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of solar UV radiation (280-400 nm) on growth, quantum yield
   and pigmentation in Gracilaria lemaneiformis were investigated when the
   thalli were cultured under solar radiation with or without UV for a
   period of 15 days. Presence of UV-A(315-400 nm) enhanced the relative
   growth rate, while UV-B (218-315 nm) inhibited it. The positive effect
   of UV-A and negative effect of UV-B counteracted to result in an
   insignificant impact of UVR on growth. During the noon period, both UV-A
   and UV-B resulted in the decrease of maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), but
   UV-B aided in the recovery of the yield in the late afternoon,
   reflecting that UV-B might be used as a signal in photorepair processes.
   UV induced the accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds (UVAC) to defend
   against the harmful UVR. However, the accumulation of UVAC took a much
   longer time compared to that previously reported, which was probably due
   to the lower levels of solar radiation and water temperature in the
   early spring period. Unknown UV-absorbing compounds (UVAC), which peaked
   at 265 nm, probably the precursor of MAAs (UVAC(325)), accumulated under
   moderate levels of solar radiation and were transformed to MAAs under
   higher solar radiation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends the static analysis of oligopoly structure into an
   infinite-horizon setting with sunk costs and demand uncertainty. The
   observation that exit rates decline with firm age motivates the
   assumption of last-in first-out dynamics: An entrant expects to produce
   no longer than any incumbent. This selects an essentially unique
   Markov-perfect equilibrium. With mild restrictions on the demand shocks,
   sequences of thresholds describe firms' equilibrium entry and survival
   decisions. Bresnahan and Reiss' (1993) empirical analysis of
   oligopolists' entry and exit assumes that such thresholds govern the
   evolution of the number of competitors. Our analysis provides an
   infinite-horizon game-theoretic foundation for that structure.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer
   death in women. We have demonstrated previously that zerumbone (ZER) has
   an anti-cancer effect towards human cervical cancer cells (HeLa).
   Methods: Anti-cancer properties of ZER were investigated using female
   Balb/c mice exposed prenatally to diethylstilboestrol. Female offspring
   have been treated with ZER (4, 8 and 16 mg/kg), normal saline and
   cisplatin (10 mg/kg; positive control). The anti-cancer properties of
   ZER were evaluated using histopathology, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end
   labeling (TUNEL) Assay and immunhistochemical staining of
   Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), a key protein in mitochondrial pathway
   of apoptosis. In addition, laser capture microdissection microscopy
   isolated RNA was amplified using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR) based on the specific primer of B-cell lymphoma 2
   (Bcl-2).
   Results: Treatment with ZER resulted (P<0.05, chi(2) statistics) in the
   regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) resembling
   cisplatin effect (10 mg/kg). TUNEL micrographs showed the absence of
   apoptosis in cancerous tissues treated with normal saline compared to
   ZER and cisplatin where abundant apoptotic cells were noticed. A post
   hoc analysis showed a significant (P<0.01) difference in mean percentage
   of apoptosis between normal saline treatment (0\%), ZER (15.7\%) and
   cisplatin (21.7\%). Immunohistochemical staining of Bax protein revealed
   that ZER modulates the expression of this apoptosis marker.
   Administration of ZER has also modulated the expression of Bcl-2 gene.
   Conclusion: These findings showed that ZER induces apoptosis efficiently
   in cervical tissues from female Balb/c mice treated prenatally with
   diethylstilboestrol. This suggested that ZER, a plant-derived compound,
   could be introduced as a new chemo-preventive agent for CIN in future.

Abstract = {{Globally the area in forest plantations is rising by 2\% annually,
   increasing the importance of plantations for production of human goods
   and services and for ecological functions such as carbon storage and
   biodiversity conservation. Specifically in the Great Lakes states and
   provinces of Midwestern North America, thousands of hectares of pine
   plantations were established in the early and mid-1900s to revegetate
   abandoned agricultural fields that had replaced mixed-species forests
   and oak-prairie ecosystems. Plantation establishment also was intended
   to bolster the timber base. Management priorities have shifted, with
   many resource managers currently seeking to manage existing plantations
   for promoting mixed-species ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to
   assess plant succession and the reestablishment of oak savanna and
   prairie species after thinning 14 plantations of Pinus resinosa and
   strobus in northwestern Ohio, USA. Thinning reduced tree basal area by
   an average of 75\%. Plant communities were sampled on 0.05-ha plots one
   and 3 years after thinning and compared to 10 unthinned control
   plantations. By 3 years after thinning, thinned plots contained 2-3
   times more species and 14 times more plant cover than control plots. The
   species composition of colonizing plants was most strongly correlated
   with residual pine basal area and soil variables related to drainage
   (e.g., sand concentration, available water capacity). Although plant
   composition was dominated by widespread colonizers such as Erechtites
   hieraciifolia, the coefficient of conservatism (indicative of species of
   more intact, undisturbed communities) significantly increased on thinned
   plots from year 1 to 3. This finding, coupled with the presence of four
   rare, state-listed Ohio species whose eight plot occurrences all were on
   thinned plots, suggests that plant composition is moving towards species
   typifying more high-quality savanna and prairie habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Defining plant communities in desert zones is difficult due to large
   scale homogeneity and small scale heterogeneity, thus making provision
   of systematic information for conservation decisions problematic. We
   analysed plant communities of the most arid sector of Monte Desert for
   structure, plant composition and environmental variables. Small-scale
   variables such as slope, rock cover, bare ground and litter, as well as
   large-scale ones such as species diversity, composition and similarity
   within and between sites were included. Analyses of floristic
   composition showed the difficulty of segregating distinct communities
   due to high internal heterogeneity and overlap between the different
   sites. Only mesquite woodlands, a community situated at the extreme of
   the soil moisture-gradient was segregated. Ordination on structural
   variables was somewhat more successful in segregating communities on the
   basis of substrate type and of tree and shrub cover. Our results showed
   the difficulty distinguishing plant communities in temperate deserts,
   suggesting the existence of relatively stable assemblages of species at
   the extremes of the gradients and of great heterogeneity within and
   between sites. They cannot be defined by floristic variables solely, but
   require environmental information also.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To define the role of prostaglandins (PG) in the endometrium
   of patients with repeated failure of embryo implantation. Prostaglandins
   are produced after the sequential oxidation of arachidonic acid by
   cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) and terminal PG synthases.
   Design: Case-control study.
   Setting: In vitro fertilization unit at a university hospital.
   Patient(s): Thirty-four women, comprising of 19 patients with repeated
   IVF failure and 15 controls with proven fertility.
   Intervention(s): Endometrial expression levels of the enzymes
   responsible for the PG synthesis were compared between the two groups.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA(2 alpha))
   expression and activity were assessed by Western blot. Expression of
   cyclooxygenase-2, secretory phospholipase A2 group IIA, V, and IB
   (sPLA(2)-IIA, sPLA(2)-V, sPLA(2)-IB), glypican-1, PG E synthase, PG E
   receptors, and lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (LPA3) was measured by
   real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Localization of COX-2,
   sPLA2-IIA, and LPA3 within the secretory endometrium was detected by
   immunohistochemistry.
   Result(s): Patients displaying recurrent implantation failure expressed
   reduced levels of cPLA(2 alpha) and COX-2 compared with controls. In
   response to this deficiency, sPLA(2)-IIA was found to be overexpressed.
   Interestingly, LPA3, which is known to converge on the
   cPLA(2)-arachidonic acid-COX-PG signaling pathway, was also decreased in
   these patients.
   Conclusion(s): Prostaglandin synthesis appears to be disrupted in
   patients with repeated IVF failure compared with fertile controls. We
   therefore suggest that reduced PG synthesis in the human endometrium may
   lead to poor endometrial receptivity. (Fertil Steril (R) 2010;94:1271-8.

Title = {{Long-term organic phosphorus mineralization in Spodosols under forests
   and its relation to carbon and nitrogen mineralization}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1479-1490}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In forest soils where a large fraction of total phosphorus (P) is in
   organic forms, soil micro-organisms play a major role in the P cycle and
   plant availability since they mediate organic P transformations.
   However, the correct assessment of organic P mineralization is usually a
   challenging task because mineralized P is rapidly sorbed and most
   mineralization fluxes are very weak. The objectives of the present work
   were to quantify in five forest Spodosols at soil depths of 0-15 cm net
   mineralization of total organic P and the resulting increase in plant
   available inorganic P and to verify whether net or gross P
   mineralization could be estimated using the Cor N mineralization rates.
   Net mineralization of total organic P was derived from the net changes
   in microbial P and gross mineralization of P in dead soil organic
   matter. We studied very low P-sorbing soils enabling us to use lower
   extractants to assess the change in total inorganic P as a result of
   gross mineralization of Pin dead soil organic matter. In addition, to
   enable detection of gross mineralization of Pin dead soil organic
   matter, a long-term incubation (517 days) experiment was carried out. At
   the beginning of the experiment, total P contents of the soils were very
   low (19-51 mu g g(-1)) and were essentially present as organic P
   (17-441.mu g g(-1), 85-91\%) or microbial P (6-14 mu g g(-1); 24-39\%).
   Conversely, the initial contents of inorganic P were low (2-7 mu g
   g(-1); 9-15\%). The net changes in the pool size of microbial P during
   the 517 days of incubation (4-8 mu g g(-1)) and the amounts of P
   resulting from gross mineralization of dead soil organic matter
   (0.001-0.018 mu g g(-1) day-1; 0.4-9.5 mu g g(-1) for the entire
   incubation period) were considerable compared to the initial amounts of
   organic P and also when compared to the initial diffusive iP fraction
   (<0.3 mu g g(-1)). Diffusive iP corresponds to the phosphate ions that
   can be transferred from the solid constituents to the soil solution
   under a gradient of concentration. Net mineralization of organic P
   induced an important increase in iP in soil solution (0.6-10 mu g g(-1);
   600-5000\% increase) and lower increases in diffusive iP fractions
   (0.3-5 mu g g(-1); 300-2000\% increase), soil solid constituents having
   an extremely low reactivity relative to iR Therefore, soil
   micro-organisms and organic P transformations play a major role in the
   bioavailability of P in these forest soils. In our study, the dead soil
   organic matter was defined as a recalcitrant organic fraction. Probably
   because gross mineralization of P from this recalcitrant organic
   fraction was mainly driven by the micro-organisms' needs for energy, the
   rates of gross mineralization of C, N and P in the recalcitrant organic
   fraction were similar. Indirect estimation of gross mineralization of P
   in dead soil organic matter using the gross C mineralization rate seems
   thus an alternative method for the studied soils. However, additional
   studies are needed to verify this alternative method in other soils. No
   relationships were found between microbial P release and microbial C and
   N releases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Confessions are uncommon in abusive head trauma (AHT) cases,
   and there is debate over whether shaking alone can cause the injuries
   characteristic of AHT. The objective of this article is to correlate
   legal statements by perpetrators with medical documentation to offer
   insights into the mechanism of injury.
   METHODS: In this retrospective observational study we examined forensic
   evidence from 112 cases referred for AHT over a 7-year period. We
   compared 29 cases in which a perpetrator confessed to violence toward
   the child with 83 cases in which there was no confession. Inclusion
   criteria were subdural hematoma (SDH) on computed tomography and
   perpetrator admission of a causal relationship between the violence
   inflicted and the child's symptoms. Groups were compared by using
   Student's t test for age and Fisher's exact test for gender, death,
   fractures, retinal hemorrhages, ecchymoses, symptoms, and SDH patterns.
   All medical records from birth to diagnosis, imaging studies, and
   written investigation reports were reviewed.
   RESULTS: All confessions came from forensic investigations. There was no
   statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for any of the
   variables studied. Shaking was described as extremely violent (100\%)
   and was repeated (55\%) from 2 to 30 times (mean: 10) because it stopped
   the infant's crying (62.5\%). Impact was uncommon (24\%). No correlation
   was found between repeated shaking and SDH densities.
   CONCLUSIONS: This unique forensic case series confirms the violence of
   shaking. The high frequency of habitual AHT is a strong argument for
   reporting suspected cases to judicial authorities and helps to explain
   the difficulty in dating the injuries. Pediatrics 2010; 126: 546-555}},

Abstract = {{Background and the purpose of the study: Many drug substances along with
   a variety of naturally occurring dietary or herbal components interact
   with the CYP enzyme system. The present study was aimed to investigate
   the effect of pomegranate juice pre-treatment on the transport of
   carbamazepine across the rat intestine
   Methods: The transport of carbamazepine across different parts of rat
   intestine was studied by everted and non-everted sac methods. The
   control and pomegranate juice (10 ml Kg(-1) for 7 days) pre-treated rats
   were sacrificed and isolated the intestine. The sacs of intestine were
   prepared, treated with carbamazepine solution and then placed in
   dulbeccos buffer. Samples were collected periodically and the drug
   content was estimated using HPLC.
   Results and conclusion: The results show that there was a significant (p
   < 0.05) difference in the transport of carbamazepine from the intestinal
   sacs of pretreated with pomegranate juice and control. It seems that
   pomegranate juice might have induced CYP3A4 enzymes and hence drug is
   extensively metabolized}},

Abstract = {{Background: Studies have found a modest association between depression
   and obesity, especially in women. Given the substantial genetic
   contribution to both depression and obesity, we sought to determine
   whether shared genetic influences are responsible for the association
   between these two conditions. Methods: Data were obtained from 712
   monozygotic and 281 dizygotic female twin pairs who are members of the
   community-based University of Washington Twin Registry. The presence of
   depression was determined by self-report of doctor-diagnosed depression.
   Obesity was defined as body mass index of >= 30 kg/m(2), based on
   self-reported height and weight. Generalized estimating regression
   models were used to assess the age-adjusted association between
   depression and obesity. Univariate and bivariate structural equation
   models estimated the components of variance attributable to genetic and
   environmental influences. Results: We found a modest phenotypic
   association between depression and obesity (odds ratio = 1.6, 95\%
   confidence interval = 1.2-2.1). Additive genetic effects contributed
   substantially to depression (57\%) and obesity (81\%). The best-fitting
   bivariate model indicated that 12\% of the genetic component of
   depression is shared with obesity. Conclusions: The association between
   depression and obesity in women may be in part due to shared genetic
   risk for both conditions. Future studies should examine the genetic,
   environmental, social, and cultural mechanisms underlying the
   relationship between this association. Depression and Anxiety

Abstract = {{In Arabidopsis, shoot stem-cells give rise to all the aerial parts of
   plant body and are localized at the tip of the shoot apex. Feedback
   signaling mediated by CLAVATA3 (CLV3) and WUSCHEL (WUS), specify and
   maintain stem-cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Although CLV3
   and WUS have been used extensively as stem-cell markers, their
   expression levels are mutually influenced by each other. Thus, CLV3 and
   WUS are not ideal markers for analyzing genes that function in this
   feedback regulation. Here, we present the expression profiles of genes
   that can be used as markers for cells of the stem-cell niche based on
   the following criteria: (1) they are expressed in cells of the central
   zone (CZ) or the rib-meristem (RM)/organizing center (OC), (2) their
   expression levels are not influenced by alterations in CLV3 or WUS
   levels, and (3) their expression is initiated during embryonic stages
   and is maintained in post-embryonic development. By RNA in-situ
   hybridization, we also found that the expression of these genes follow
   two distinct patterns: (1) CLV3-like and (2) WUS-like. Moreover, the
   expression domains of these genes expand in SAMs of clv3 mutants, which
   accumulate higher numbers of stem-cells. A comprehensive expression
   patterns provided here suggests that they are ideal markers for
   stem-cell niche of Arabidopsis shoot apex. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Multimedia multicast with two servers based on the multiterminal source
   coding is studied in some previous researches. Due to the possibility of
   providing an approach for practical code design for more than two
   correlated sources in IMTSC/CEO setup, in this paper, the framework of
   Slepian-Wolf coded quantization is extended and a practical code design
   is presented for IMTSC/CEO with the number of encoders greater than two.
   Then the multicast system based on the IMTSC/CEO is applied to the cases
   with three, four and five servers. Since the underlying code design
   approach for the IMTSC/CEO problem has the capability of applying to an
   arbitrary number of active encoders, the proposed MMBMSC method can also
   be used with an arbitrary number of servers easily. Also, explicit
   expressions of the expected distortion with an arbitrary number of
   servers in the MMBMSC system are presented. Experimental results with
   data, image and video signals show the superiority of our proposed
   method over the conventional solutions and over the MMBMSC system with

Abstract = {{This article investigates the extent to which economic markets have
   incorporated mainstream artistic acceptance of African American art.
   Prices of oil paintings sold at auction from 1972 to 2004 for African
   American artists are compared to their contemporaries. Gross means
   between the two groups reveal averages significantly lower for African
   American artists throughout the time period. Hedonic regressions, used
   to refine the statistical analysis by controlling for factors
   characterizing the painting and auction environment, also reveal that
   African American artists fetch lower prices. The hedonic regressions,
   however, reveal a narrowing gap between the two groups since price
   appreciation has been higher for works by African American artists. The
   high investment returns have made investment in paintings by African
   American artists a relatively profitable niche in recent years comparing
   well with traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. This
   profitability may continue since painting prices for African Americans
   have not completely caught up to those of contemporaries.}},

Abstract = {{This review chronicles the exploration of the curcumin in terms of
   development of analogues for the anticancer activity over the last
   century. Curcumin is a natural phytochemical obtained from dried root
   and rhizome of Turmeric (Curcuma Longa). It has been shown to interfere
   with multiple cell signaling pathways, including apoptosis (activation
   of caspases and downregulation of antiapoptotic gene products),
   proliferation (HER-2, EGFR, and AP-1), angiogenesis (VEGF), and
   inflammation (NF-kappa B, TNF, IL-6, IL-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX). In the
   last decade it has been much explored and various synthetic analogues
   have been prepared and evaluated for various pharmacological activities.
   Most of the analogues have shown very good anticancer activity in
   various models and various cell lines. However, some analogues have also
   shown antioxidant, anti-HIV, antimutagenic, antiangiogenic,
   antimalarial, antitubercular, antiandrogenic. COX inhibitory activities.
   Few analogues have shown very potent results and may be considered as
   clinical candidates for the development of future anticancer agent. This
   review contains 728 curcumin analogues and covers the literature from

Abstract = {{The noninvasive estimation of nutrient digestibility (DIG) is usually
   done by total collection (TC) of feces in balance crates or by the
   indicator method (IM) using an indigestible marker such `as chromic
   oxide (CO). TC is precise but involves much labor. These methods were
   compared using pigs fed corn-soybean meal diets. In Trial 1, 10 pigs
   (68.1 kg) were individually housed in metabolism crates for a 5-day (d)
   TC. The IM phase immediately followed by adding CO to the feed for 2
   consecutive d, and collecting a single grab fecal sample. In Trial 2, 24
   pigs (66.2 kg) were used and Cr was fed for 7 consecutive d with single
   samples collected for 5 d starting when the stool color appeared bright
   green (which usually occurred on d3 after Cr was fed). Samples were
   composited into 5 final samples (d1, d1 + 2. d1 + 2 + 3, d1 +2+3+4. d1 +
   2 + 3 + 4 + 5) labeled D1, D2, D3, D4. and D5, respectively. In Trial 1,
   DIG values of DM, energy, and N were 2 similar to 3 percentage points
   lower for IM vs TC; DIG of Ca and P was 10-20 percentage points lower
   for IM. Differences related to dietary treatments were observed for 4 of
   these nutrients with TC but none of the nutrients with IM. In Trial 2,
   DIG by IM increased from D1 through D5, coinciding with increasing Cr
   excretion. For the macronutrients evaluated, all reached their DIG
   plateaus by D5 and similar values were observed between TC and IM.
   Dietary treatment differences were observed for Ca and P by TC and were
   also detected by IM. It is concluded that a multiday sample works better
   than a single grab sample for IM and that several days of marker
   observance are required before the marker content stabilizes in feces.

Abstract = {{The in-situ bonding of pultruded fibre-reinforced plastic rods into
   timber structural members is a commonly used technique for making
   timber-to-timber connections and for the strengthening and repair of
   timber structures. Ideally, the adhesive should be thixotropic, shear
   thinning, room temperature cure, environmentally stable, solvent-free
   and applied without pressure. This study investigates the moisture
   absorption characteristics of three adhesives, specially formulated for
   bonded-in timber connections, where two of the adhesives are modified
   with nano- or micro-particles. The three adhesives are denoted as
   CB10TSS (standard adhesive), Albipox (standard adhesive with CTBN rubber
   additions) and Timberset (standard adhesive filled with ceramic
   particles). The aim of the additions is to improve the environmental
   stability of the standard adhesive as well as enhancing mechanical
   properties and raising the glass transition temperature. The effect of
   high temperatures and high humidity on the properties of the three
   adhesives was determined following conditioning at different
   combinations of temperature and relative humidity (20, 30 and 50 degrees
   C/95\% RH) and soaking in water at 20 degrees C. In all cases the
   moisture uptake for the rubber-modified adhesive was less than for the
   standard adhesive, but the ceramic particle-filled adhesive exhibited
   the lowest moisture uptake overall. Exposure to humid environments at
   temperatures lower than T(g) resulted in water uptake characterized as
   Fickian, which had only a modest effect on properties. However, exposure
   to humid environments at temperatures higher than T(g) resulted in
   non-Fickian uptake of water and significant changes to the diffusion and
   permeability coefficients. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the use of two integer inversion algorithms, a modified
   Montgomery modulo inverse and a Fermat's Little Theorem based inversion,
   in a prime-field affine-coordinate elliptic-curve crypto-processor. To
   perform this, we present a low-power/energy GF(p) affine-coordinate
   elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) processor design with a simplified
   architecture and complete flexibility in terms of the field and curve
   parameters. The design can use either of the inversion algorithms. Based
   on the implementations of this design for 168-, 192-, and 224-bit prime
   fields using a standard 0.13 mu m CMOS technology, we compare the
   efficiency of the algorithms in terms of power/energy consumption, area,
   and calculation time. The results show that while the Fermat's theorem
   approach is not appropriate for the affine-coordinate ECC processors due
   to its long computation time, the Montgomery modulo inverse algorithm is
   a good candidate for low-energy implementations. The results also show
   that the 168-bit ECC processor based on the Montgomery modulo inverse
   completes one scalar multiplication in only 0.4 s at a 1 MHz clock
   frequency consuming only 12.92 mu J, which is lower than the reported

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. There are a
   limited number of therapeutic options available for the treatment of AD.
   Curcuminoids (a mixture of bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin and
   curcumin) is the main chemical constituent found in turmeric, a well
   known curry spice, having potential in the treatment of AD. The
   objective of this study was to investigate the effects of curcuminoid
   mixture and individual constituents on spatial learning and memory in an
   amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide-infused rat model of AD and on the
   expression of PSD-95, synaptophysin and camkIV. Curcuminoid mixture
   showed a memory-enhancing effect in rats displaying AD-like neuronal
   loss only at 30 mg/kg, whereas individual components were effective at
   3-30 mg/kg. A shorter duration treatment with test compounds showed that
   the curcuminoid mixture and bisdemethoxycurcumin increased PSD-95
   expression in the hippocampus at 3-30 mg/kg, with maximum effect at a
   lower dose (3 mg/kg) with respective values of 470.5 and 587.9\%.
   However, after a longer duration treatment, two other compounds
   (demethoxycurcumin and curcumin) also increased PSD-95 to 331.7 and
   226.2\% respectively at 30 mg/kg. When studied for their effect on
   synaptophysin in the hippocampus after the longer duration treatment,
   the curcuminoid mixture and all three individual constituents increased
   synaptophysin expression. Of these, demethoxycurcumin was the most
   effective showing a 350.1\% increase (P<0.01) at 30 mg/kg compared to
   the neurotoxin group. When studied for their effect on camkIV expression
   after longer treatment in the hippocampus, only demethoxycurcumin at 30
   mg/kg increased levels to 421.2\%. These compounds salvaged PSD-95,
   synaptophysin and camkIV expression levels in the hippocampus in the rat
   AD model, which suggests multiple target sites with the potential of
   curcuminoids in spatial memory enhancing and disease modifying in AD.

Abstract = {{Myxedema coma is the extreme form of untreated hypothyroidism. In

   a patient with myxedema coma which was initially misdiagnosed as a brain
   stem infarct. She presented to the hospital with alteration of the
   mental status, generalized edema, hypothermia, hypoventilation, and
   hypotension. Initially her brain stem reflexes were absent. After
   respiratory and circulatory support, her neurologic status was not
   improved soon. The diagnosis of myxedema coma was often missed or
   delayed due to various clinical findings and concomitant medical
   condition and precipitating factors. It is more difficult to diagnose
   when a patient has no medical history of hypothyroidism. A high index of
   clinical suspicion can make a timely diagnosis and initiate appropriate
   treatment. We report this case to alert clinicians considering diagnosis

Abstract = {{Recent investigations have shown that arsthinol, a trivalent
   organoarsenic compound (dithiarsolane), has been active in vitro on
   leukemia cell lines and offers a better therapeutic index than arsenic
   trioxide, as estimated by the ratio LD50/IC50. To complete our
   understanding of its urinary excretion, a sensitive method using liquid
   chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used. Mice
   were injected intravenously with a single dose of arsthinol at 0.2
   mmol/kg of body weight. The amount of total arsenic in tissues and body
   fluids was determined by a colorimetric method and urine metabolites
   were analyzed on a C18 Acclaim PepMap 100 angstrom column by LC-MS. Our
   results showed that only three arsenic species (acetarsol, acetarsol
   oxide and arsthinol) were detected in the first 24-h urine. Overall,
   this study confirms that the hydrolysis of dithiarsolanes to arsenoxides
   (i.e. acetarsol oxide) can be followed by an oxidation in arsonic acids
   (i.e. acetarsol). All these compounds are excreted in the urine.}},

Abstract = {{This study, in which 310 university students participated, was designed
   to investigate whether computer interfaces that offer human-like
   apologetic error messages influence users' self-appraisals of
   performance in the computerized environment. The study consists of three
   phases. In the first phase, using the CCSARP (cross-cultural study of
   speech act realization patterns) coding manual, apology strategy
   sequences were elicited from Turkish participants. Two of these apology
   strategy sequences were selected for the second phase, which is a test
   including experimental and control groups. The experimental groups were
   presented with the two apology sequences, and the control group was
   given a plain computer message. The second phase investigated whether
   any of these three messages were perceived as apologies. The results
   indicate that the two apology messages were perceived as apologies, but
   the plain computer message was not perceived as one. The third phase
   investigated the relationship between the users' moods and their
   self-appraisals of performance after the transmission of the apologetic
   error messages. The findings show that the influence of apology messages
   on the users' self-appraisals of performance depends on the
   participants' mood state and the content of the apology messages. (c)

   directions orthogonal to them. The equations also describe the torsion
   of bodies of revolution and their deformation behavior under the action
   of inertia forces in rotation around the symmetry axis. The results of a
   numerical investigation into the large deformations of toroidal bodies

Journal = {{TURKISH JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Calabash chalk is a naturally occurring mineral consumed
   among the Nigerian community for pleasure and commonly by pregnant women
   as a remedy for morning sickness. Reports have shown that it contains
   different toxic substances, with lead being the most abundant. This
   study was therefore undertaken to ascertain the effect of two commonly
   available preparations of this chalk on some hematological parameters.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty-four adult female Wistar rats with average
   weight of 100 g were assigned into three groups (1, 2, 3). Group 1
   served as the control and the animals received distilled water, while
   Groups 2 and 3 were treated by oral gavage with 40 mg/kg of non-salted
   (NSCC) and salted calabash chalk (SCC), respectively, for 14 days.
   Results: The hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and red blood cell (RBC)
   count were significantly (p<0.05, 0.001 respectively) lower in the NSCC
   group, while erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was significantly (p <
   0.05) higher in the NSCC group compared to the control. There were no
   significant differences in packed cell volume (PCV), white blood cell
   (WBC) and platelet (Pl) counts compared to the control. The SCC group
   presented no significant difference in all blood count parameters
   compared to the control.
   Conclusion: This infers that calabash chalk, particularly the non-salted
   form, alters the normal concentration of Hb, RBC and Pl counts, and ESR,
   as observed in the female Wistar rats studied. (Turk J Hematol 2010; 27:

Abstract = {{Statherin is a low molecular-weight phosphoprotein secreted from the
   parotid gland. Statherin mRNA was previously reported to be a useful
   marker for mRNA-based saliva identification. In this study,
   applicability of ELISA detection of statherin for forensic
   identification of saliva was investigated. The specificity and
   sensitivity of ELISA for detection of statherin were compared with those
   of ELISA for cc-amylase and the Phadebas (R) amylase test. Statherin was
   specifically detected in saliva but not in other body fluids. In
   addition, statherin was successfully detected in aged saliva stains,
   mixed body fluids saliva stains, and simulated casework samples. On the
   other hand, although ELISA for a-amylase showed higher sensitivity than
   ELISA for statherin, it was not specific enough to identify saliva. The
   Phadebas amylase test also showed positive results in other body fluids
   that are known to have alpha-amylase activity; however, it is easy to
   use for screening forensic casework samples. In conclusion, ELISA for
   detection of statherin developed in this study could be an effective
   tool for the forensic identification of saliva because of its
   specificity for saliva among other body fluids. Forensic casework
   samples should be tested by ELISA detection or mRNA-based analysis for
   statherin, depending on the condition of the sample, to supplement
   presumptive tests for a-amylase, such as the Phadebas amylase test.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database was queried to
   ascertain current trends in management of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and
   to determine the prevalence of various surgical techniques.
   Methods. The study population (n = 3059 operations) was all index
   operations in 2002-2007, age 0-18 years with Primary Diagnosis of TOF,
   and Primary Procedure TOF repair or palliation. Patients with Pulmonary
   Atresia, Absent Pulmonary Valve, and Atrioventricular Canal were
   excluded.
   Results. 294 patients had initial palliation, including 178 neonates.
   2534 patients had repair of TOF as the initial operation (primary
   repair), including 154 neonates. 217 patients had repair of TOF after
   prior palliation. Of patients who had primary repair (n = 2534), 975 had
   repair at 3 to 6 months, 614 at 6 months to 1 year, 492 at 1 to 3
   months, and 154 at 0 to 30 days. Of patients who had repair following
   prior palliation (n = 217), 65 had repair in the first 6 months of life,
   111 at 6 months to 1 year, and only 41 (18.9\%) at more than 1 year of
   age. Type of repair: Of 2534 primary repairs, 581 (23\%) had no
   ventriculotomy, 571 (23\%) had nontransanular patch, 1329 (52\%) had
   transanular patch, and 53 (2\%) had right ventricle to pulmonary artery
   conduits. Of repairs after prior palliation (n = 217), 20 (9\%) had no
   ventriculotomy, 30 (14\%) had nontransanular patch, 144 (66\%) had
   transanular patch, and 24 (11\%) had conduits. Discharge mortality (95\%
   confidence interval; CI) was 22 of 294 (7.5\%; CI: 4.7\%-11.1\%) for
   initial palliation, 33 of 2534 (1.3\%; CI: 0.9\%-1.8\%) for primary
   repair, and 2 of 217 (0.9\%; CI: 0.1\%-3.3\%) for secondary repair. For
   neonates, discharge mortality was 11 of 178 (6.2\%; CI: 3.1\%-10.8\%)
   for palliation and 12 of 154 (7.8\%; CI: 4.1\%-13.2\%) for primary
   repair.
   Conclusions. Primary repair in the first year of life is the most
   prevalent strategy. Despite contemporary awareness of the late
   consequences of pulmonary insufficiency, ventriculotomy with transanular
   patch remains the most prevalent technique, both for primary repair and
   for repair following palliation. (Ann Thorac Surg 2010; 90: 813-20) (C)

Abstract = {{Objective. To assess the effect of parity on the occurrence of
   prediabetes defined as an abnormal fasting plasma glucose (5.6-6.9
   mmol/l), an abnormal 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (7.7-11.1
   mmol/l), or both, before 12 weeks gestation or at least 6 weeks after
   delivery. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. Nested on a
   community trial Delaying the Development of Diabetes Mellitus type 2
   (AMAL study) in Oman. Population. 532 women with a total of 3,196
   pregnancies. Methods. We conducted sets of Cox proportional hazard
   regression analyses: crude, age-adjusted and full models which adjusted
   for maternal age, education, family income and year of delivery. Main
   outcome measures. Hazard ratio (HR) of the effect of parity on
   prediabetes. Results. We enumerated 258 cases of prediabetes over 8,529
   person-years of follow up. In the crude model, high parity (>= 5)
   pregnancies carried a higher risk of prediabetes than low parity (<5)
   pregnancies (HR = 3.72; 95\% CI = 2.80, 4.91), and the prediabetes
   incidence rate increased in a dose-response fashion over multiple
   categories of parity. In age-only models, the association attenuated
   with control of the confounding effect of maternal age (HR = 1.05; 95\%
   CI = 0.76, 1.45). Adjusting for other confounders in the full models
   yielded similar results to those adjusted for maternal age only.
   Conclusions. The apparent effect of parity on the occurrence of
   prediabetes is attributable to the confounding effect of maternal age
   rather than to high parity.}},

   doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00057.2010.-Ghrelin is a stomach derivate peptide
   involved in energy homeostasis regulation, and ghrelin O-acyltransferase
   (GOAT) is the enzyme responsible for ghrelin acylation. Puberty is a
   period characterized by profound changes in the metabolic requirements
   and notable variations of sexual hormone levels. On the other hand, the
   weaning process is a fundamental modification of the diet, which
   implicates several adaptations of the gastrointestinal tract physiology.
   Until now the direct secretion of ghrelin by the stomach in these
   conditions, without interferences from other organs, has never been
   studied. The main objective of this article was to investigate how the
   stomach modulates ghrelin production and secretion as well as GOAT
   expression on these periods of life. Gastric ghrelin secretion is
   regulated through postnatal life in an independent way of gastric
   expression and circulating levels of this hormone. The present work
   shows a strong regulation of gastric ghrelin secretion by estrogens. The
   weaning strongly regulates gastric ghrelin secretion. Animals subjected
   to delayed weaning present a lower body weight than the corresponding
   controls. For the first time, it is shown that a noticeable decrease in
   circulating levels of testosterone and estrogens is associated with
   delay of weaning. GOAT mRNA levels in the stomach are strongly regulated
   by age, breastfeeding, and testosterone. In conclusion, the stomach
   itself regulates ghrelin and GOAT production to adapt the organism to
   the metabolic requirements demanded through each stage of life.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To compare central corneal thickness (CCT) measurements
   obtained using the Pentacam Scheimpflug system with those obtained using
   DGH ultrasound pachymetry (UP) in post-laser in situ keratomileusis
   (LASIK) eyes for myopia.
   METHODS. In a prospective study, measurement agreement was assessed in
   143 eyes of 72 post-LASIK patients using both the Pentacam and UP at the
   Eye Consultants Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   RESULTS. The mean CCT was 522+/-42.2 mu m with the Oculus Pentacam and
   516.2+/-40.6 mu m with UP. The Bland-Altman plot showed that the mean
   +/-SD for the differences between the 2 devices was 5.8+/-13.6 mu m,
   with 95\% confidence interval limits ranging from -20.9 mu m to 32.6 mu
   m. A test of statistical significance indicated that the mean
   differences of 5.8+/-13.6 mu m differed significantly from zero
   (p<0.001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test), thus indicating that the Pentacam
   measurements tended to overestimate CCT compared with UP. Analysis of
   regression showed a high correlation between the values obtained with
   both devices (r=0.947, p<0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS. In post-LASIK myopic eyes, although a high correlation has
   been shown between Pentacam and UP measurements, Pentacam tends to
   overestimate CCT compared to UP. Pentacam probably cannot be used
   interchangeably with UP in post-LASIK eyes for myopia. (Eur J Ophthalmol

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) increases in-hospital
   mortality of ventilated patients to 46\%, compared with 32\% for
   ventilated patients who do not develop VAP. In addition, VAP prolongs
   time spent on the ventilator, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay,
   and length of hospital stay.
   Methods: In this study, we implemented VAP bundle to decrease the rate
   of VAP infection. This is a pre- and postintervention trial beginning in
   2006 to decrease the rate of VAP in adult ICUs after initiation of the
   Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) VAP bundle compared with the
   VAP rate for the preceding 12 months. The study was conducted at a
   private general hospital in Saudi Arabia. The study included all adult
   patients who were on mechanical ventilation from 2006 to 2008. An
   interdisciplinary performance improvement team was formed. The team
   implemented an evidence-based VAP bundle adopted from the IHI.
   Results: The implementation of the VAP prevention bundle resulted in the
   reduction of VAP rates from a mean of 9.3 cases per 1000 ventilator-days
   in fiscal year 2006 to 2.3 cases per 1000 ventilator-days in 2007 and to
   2.2 in 2008 (P < .001). It is estimated that each VAP case increases the
   hospital length of stay attributable by 10 days and the mean hospital
   cost by \$40,000. Thus, the potential decrease in hospital cost is
   \$780,000 annually.
   Conclusion: Implementing the IHI VAP bundle significantly resulted in
   the reduction of the VAP rate with potential great cost avoidance.}},

Title = {{Cell Polarity Regulator PARD6B Is Essential for Trophectoderm Formation

Abstract = {{In preimplantation mouse development, the first cell lineages to be
   established are the trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass. TE possesses
   epithelial features, including apical-basal cell polarity and
   intercellular junctions, which are crucial to generate a fluid-filled
   cavity in the blastocyst. Homo logs of the partitioning defective (par)
   genes in Caenorhabditis elegans are critical regulators of cell
   polarity. However, their roles in regulating TE differentiation and
   blastocyst formation remain unclear. Here, the role of mouse Pard6b, a
   homolog of par-6 gene and a component of the PAR-atypical protein kinase
   C (aPKC) complex, was investigated. Pard6b expression was knocked down
   by microinjecting RNA interference construct into zygotes.
   Pard6b-knockdown embryos cleaved and compacted normally but failed to
   form the blastocyst cavity. The cavitation failure is likely the result
   of defective intercellular junctions, because Pard6b knockdown caused
   abnormal distribution of actin filaments and TJP1 (ZO-1) tight junction
   (TJ) protein and interfered with cavitation in chimeras containing cells
   from normal embryos. Defective TJ formation may be caused by abnormal
   cell polarization, because the apical localization of PRKCZ (aPKCzeta)
   was absent in Pard6b-knockdown embryos. Pard6b knockdown also diminished
   the expression of CDX2, a TE-lineage transcription factor, in the outer
   cells. TEAD4, a transcriptional activator that is required for Cdx2
   expression and cavity formation, was not essential for the transcription
   of Pard6b. Taken together, Pard6b is necessary for blastocyst
   morphogenesis, particularly the development of TE-specific
   features-namely, the apical-basal cell polarity, formation of TJ
   paracellular permeability sealing, and up-regulated expression of Cdx2.}},

   principal component analysis (KPCA). The proposed method uses
   reconstruction-based contributions (RBC) to diagnose simple and complex

   linear PCA, a combined index, based on the weighted combination of the
   Hotel ling's T-2 and SPE indices, is proposed. Control limits for these
   fault detection indices are proposed using second-order moment
   approximation. The proposed fault detection and diagnosis scheme is
   tested with a simulated CSTR process where simple and complex faults are
   introduced. The simulation results show that the proposed fault
   detection and diagnosis methods are effective for KPCA.}},

Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{A highly optimized Monte Carlo (MC) code package for simulating light
   transport is developed on the latest graphics processing unit (GPU)
   built for general-purpose computing from NVIDIA - the Fermi GPU. In
   biomedical optics, the MC method is the gold standard approach for
   simulating light transport in biological tissue, both due to its
   accuracy and its flexibility in modelling realistic, heterogeneous
   tissue geometry in 3-D. However, the widespread use of MC simulations in
   inverse problems, such as treatment planning for PDT, is limited by
   their long computation time. Despite its parallel nature, optimizing MC
   code on the GPU has been shown to be a challenge, particularly when the
   sharing of simulation result matrices among many parallel threads
   demands the frequent use of atomic instructions to access the slow GPU
   global memory. This paper proposes an optimization scheme that utilizes
   the fast shared memory to resolve the performance bottleneck caused by
   atomic access, and discusses numerous other optimization techniques
   needed to harness the full potential of the GPU. Using these techniques,
   a widely accepted MC code package in biophotonics, called MCML, was
   successfully accelerated on a Fermi GPU by approximately 600x compared
   to a state-of-the-art Intel Core i7 CPU. A skin model consisting of 7
   layers was used as the standard simulation geometry. To demonstrate the
   possibility of GPU cluster computing, the same GPU code was executed on
   four GPUs, showing a linear improvement in performance with an
   increasing number of GPUs. The GPU-based MCML code package, named
   GPU-MCML, is compatible with a wide range of graphics cards and is
   released as an open-source software in two versions: an optimized
   version tuned for high performance and a simplified version for
   beginners (http://code.google.com/p/gpumcml). (C) 2010 Optical Society

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1377-1386}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We discuss the apparent paradox that while introduced populations often
   adapt rapidly to conditions in the new range, it is normally assumed
   that the species' niche remains unchanged. Focusing on plants, we argue
   that studies of the niche dynamics of alien species are useful for
   understanding the constraints acting on species in their native ranges,
   and vice versa. Most hypotheses about species ecological range margins
   are more consistent with there being a niche shift than niche stasis in
   the new range. After reviewing the evidence for niche shifts in alien
   species, we suggest that the probability of a shift occurring depends
   primarily upon the ecological and genetic processes limiting the species
   in its native range. For example, a fundamental niche shift might occur
   if introduced individuals are released from maladaptive gene flow from
   central populations, or if genetic diversity is increased by the mixing
   of individuals from different sources. In addition, other factors such
   as species characteristics, introduction history and conditions in the
   new range may also influence whether a niche shift occurs. Based on
   these considerations, we propose conditions under which niche shifts are
   most likely. Such understanding is important for predicting and
   mitigating current and future anthropogenic impacts on species ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Chemists use one set of orbitals when comparing to a structural formula,
   hybridized AOs or NBOs for example, and another for reasoning in terms
   of frontier orbitals, MOs usually. Chemical arguments can frequently be
   made in terms of energy and/or electron density without the
   consideration of orbitals at all. All orbital representations,
   orthogonal or not, within a given function space are related by linear
   transformation. Chemical arguments based on orbitals are really energy
   or electron density arguments; orbitals are linked to these observables
   through the use of operators. The Valency Interaction Formula, VIF,
   offers a system of chemical reasoning based on the invariance of
   observables from one orbital representation to another. VIF pictures
   have been defined as one-electron density and Hamiltonian operators.
   These pictures are classified in a chemically meaningful way by use of
   linear transformations applied to them in the form of two pictorial
   rules and the invariance of the number of doubly, singly, and unoccupied
   orbitals or bonding, nonbonding, and antibonding orbitals under these
   transformations. The compatibility of the VIF method with the bond pair
   - lone pair language of Lewis is demonstrated. Different electron lone
   pair representations are related by the pictorial rules and have
   stability understood in terms of Walsh's rules. Symmetries of conjugated
   ring systems are related to their electronic state by simple
   mathematical formulas. Description of lone pairs in conjugated systems
   is based on the strength and sign of orbital interactions around the
   ring. Simple models for bonding in copper clusters are tested, and the
   bonding of O-2 to Fe(II) in hemoglobin is described. Arguments made are
   supported by HF, B3LYP, and MP2 computations.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to provide insights into the politics of
   geographical knowledge production and, in particular, how urban elites
   are making increasing use of geographical knowledge to legitimise urban
   policy programmes that service the interests of state and business
   elites while visiting harm on others. The article takes as its focus
   processes of disinvestment whereby working class areas of cities are
   deliberately (or allowed to become) run down in order to make them ripe
   for future redevelopment and gentrification. Some geographers have
   called this process `creative destruction'. Two points are pertinent.
   First, political rhetoric has conventionally been used to legitimise
   such processes - given that they might otherwise be problematic - `in
   the eyes of the people'. Geographers tended to make their own
   observations of these processes from a critical distance. Second, the
   state and capital are now making greater use of geographical knowledge
   in order to buttress their political rhetoric and thereby their
   legitimisation of programmes of creative destruction. This is a cause
   for concern because increasing use is being made of geographical
   knowledge in order to legitimise the manufacture of oppression in UK
   cities. A case study of the Housing Market Renewal programme in the UK
   is used to make this argument.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared the preference for learning styles of dental
   students in a small class in physiology at a South African university
   with the preference for teaching styles of the lecturers. It also
   analyzed and evaluated the teaching methods and aids the lecturers used.
   The study was done in the last teaching block of the year after students
   have been exposed to all the lecturing styles in the same premedical
   subject. Two separate questionnaires were used in the study in order to
   evaluate teaching methods and teaching media used by the lecturers and
   to measure the teaching methods and teaching media that students
   preferred. Through a critical analysis of the data, it was found that
   the students preferred cooperative and active teaching/learning
   experiences more than the lecturers are using them. The study emphasizes
   the importance of students being actively involved in the
   teaching-learning process through cooperative methods. This may enhance
   their ability to utilize cognitive skills such as creative thinking,
   interpretation, critical thinking, and problem-solving.}},

Abstract = {{alpha-Zr phosphate (hereafter referred to as ZrP) based composites were
   prepared by melt blending in order to improve the flame retardancy
   properties of polyamide 6 (PA6), polyethylene terephthalate (PET),
   polypropylene (PP) and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA). Different
   morphologies are distinguishable by electron microscopy: PA6-ZrP seems
   to be a nanocomposite by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) whereas
   PET-, PP- and EVA-ZrP blends appear micro-composites by X-Ray
   Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyses. ZrP
   acts as flame retardant in PA6 reducing the total heat evolved and
   consequently the heat release rate during the combustion measured by
   cone calorimetry. Moreover, ZrP reduces the flammability of PET and EVA
   acting in synergistic effect with phosphorous based flame retardants.
   Indeed, it is showed that it is possible to reduce the amount of
   phosphorous flame retardant adding ZrP to reach UL94 classification V0
   for both polymers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FAMILIAL CANCER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Carney triad is a usually sporadic association of pulmonary chondroma,
   gastrointestinal stromal tumours, and paraganglioma. The majority of
   patients have two of these tumours, the gastric and pulmonary tumours
   being the most common combination. Carney Stratakis syndrome is an
   association of familial paraganglioma and gastric stromal sarcoma and it
   is considered to be a distinct condition from Carney triad as it is
   dominantly inherited and not associated with pulmonary chondroma. We
   report two unrelated patients each with two components of Carney triad.
   A pathological mutation in succinate dehydrogenase subunit B gene was
   identified in one and a variant in the same gene was identified in the
   other. This report demonstrates the difficulty in distinguishing between
   Carney triad and Carney Stratakis syndrome due to the rarity of the
   individual components. The fact that most patients with Carney triad
   have only two components of the Triad, and the long interval often seen
   between the occurrence of the first and the second component makes it
   difficult to differentiate confidently between the two conditions.
   Molecular information should improve the diagnosis of Carney triad.}},

Abstract = {{Almost all religions incorporate some form of meditation. Muslim prayer
   is the meditation of Islam. It is an obligatory prayer for all Muslims
   that is performed five times a day. Although a large body of literature
   exists on EEG changes in meditation, to date there has been no research
   published in a peer-reviewed journal on EEG changes during Muslim
   prayer. The purpose of this pilot study is to encourage further
   investigation on this type of meditation. Results of EEG analysis in
   twenty-five trials of Muslim prayer are reported. Some of the findings
   are consistent with the majority of the previous meditation studies
   (alpha rhythm slowing, increased alpha rhythm coherence). However,
   Muslim prayer does not show an increase in alpha and/or theta power like
   most of the results of other meditation studies. The possible cause of
   this discrepancy in meditation-related studies is highlighted and a
   systematic and standardised roadmap for future Muslim prayer EEG
   research is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to evaluate the toxic effects of
   monocrotophos in ciliate models Paramecium caudatum and Oxytricha
   fallax. In acute toxicity studies higher concentrations of monocrotophos
   caused marked increase in mobility of cells exhibiting rocking movements
   within two mins of exposure but were decreased after 30 mins. LC50 value
   by mortality curve for 3 hr acute toxicity test of Oxytricha fallax and
   Paramecium caudatum was found 307.744+/-33.27mg l(-1) and
   332.284+/-57.52 mg l(-1) respectively Oxytricha fallax was found
   sensitive than Paramecium caudatum to monocrotophos. In acute exposure
   cells showed deformities such as swelling, oval shaped deformity and in
   higher concentrations shortening of longitudinal axis with blackening of
   cytoplasm occurred. The length of paramecia was reduced prominently.
   Similarly, enlargement of contractile vacuole and stress egestion of
   food vacuoles was also observed. The morphological studies showed the
   changes in shape, size, colour and width of Paramecia and Oxytricha.
   Frequencies of macronuclear aberrations were significant showing
   deformities such as rod shaped, elongation, fragmentation, diffusion and
   total absence of nucleus and were concentration dependent. The data
   provided in the present study on interaction of pesticides with nuclear
   structure can be of immense value because most of these pesticides have
   been reported to have carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic

Abstract = {{Wireless mesh networks extend the connectivity range of mobile devices
   by using multiple access points, some of them connected to the Internet,
   to create a mesh topology and forward packets over multiple wireless
   hops. However, the quality of service provided by the mesh is impaired
   by the delays and disconnections caused by handoffs, as clients move
   within the area covered by multiple access points. We present the
   architecture and protocols of SMesh, the first transparent wireless mesh
   system that offers seamless, fast handoff, supporting real-time
   applications such as interactive VoIP. The handoff and routing logic is
   done solely by the access points, and therefore connectivity is
   attainable by any 802.11 device. In SMesh, the entire mesh network is
   seen by the mobile clients as a single, omnipresent access point, giving
   the mobile clients the illusion that they are stationary. We use
   multicast for access points coordination and, during handoff
   transitions, we use more than one access point to handle the moving
   client. SMesh provides a hybrid routing protocol that optimizes routes
   over wireless and wired links in a multihomed environment. Experimental
   results on a fully deployed mesh network demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the SMesh architecture and its intra-domain and inter-domain handoff
   protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/hypotheses To investigate the effects of extracellular purines on
   insulin secretion from mouse pancreatic islets.
   Methods Mouse islets and beta cells were isolated and examined with mRNA
   real-time quantification, cAMP quantification and insulin and glucagon
   secretion. ATP release was measured in MIN6c4 cells. Insulin and
   glucagon secretion were measured in vivo after glucose injection.
   Results Enzymatic removal of extracellular ATP at low glucose levels
   increased the secretion of both insulin and glucagon, while at high
   glucose levels insulin secretion was reduced and glucagon secretion was
   stimulated, indicating an autocrine effect of purines. In MIN6c4 cells
   it was shown that glucose does induce release of ATP into the
   extracellular space. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated the
   expression of the ADP receptors P2Y(1) and P2Y(13) in both intact mouse
   pancreatic islets and isolated beta cells. The stable ADP analogue
   2-MeSADP had no effect on insulin secretion. However, co-incubation with
   the P2Y(1) antagonist MRS2179 inhibited insulin secretion, while
   co-incubation with the P2Y(13) antagonist MRS2211 stimulated insulin
   secretion, indicating that ADP acting via P2Y(1) stimulates insulin
   secretion, while signalling via P2Y(13) inhibits the secretion of
   insulin. P2Y13 antagonism through MRS2211 per se increased the secretion
   of both insulin and glucagon at intermediate (8.3 mmol/l) and high (20
   mmol/l) glucose levels, confirming an autocrine role for ADP.
   Administration of MRS2211 during glucose injection in vivo resulted in
   both increased secretion of insulin and reduced glucose levels.
   Conclusions/interpretation In conclusion, ADP acting on the P2Y(13)
   receptors inhibits insulin release. An antagonist to P2Y(13) increases
   insulin release and could be evaluated for the treatment of diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{The open tendon suture is the most commonly used method of treatment for
   Achilles tendon rupture in Germany. Over the last decade the therapeutic
   spectrum of operative methods has been further enlarged by the
   development of new minimally invasive surgical techniques. Important
   criteria for planning treatment are the location and age of the rupture
   and comorbidities. For recent Achilles tendon ruptures minimally
   invasive suturing is indicated but for older ruptures a reconstruction
   often has to be carried out. The decisive disadvantage of an open tendon
   suture is the relatively high risk of infection. Using minimally
   invasive surgical techniques the frequency of postoperative infection
   could be significantly reduced. The suture methods without opening the
   ruptured region can be collectively grouped under the term percutaneous
   suture techniques and the minimally invasive methods with opening of the
   rupture region as combined open percutaneous techniques. Documented
   problems with the Ma-Griffith technique, such as injury of the sural
   nerve, low stability of the suture and insufficient adaption of the
   tendon stumps have been minimized by new minimally invasive operation
   techniques. Achilles tendon ruptures which nearly always arise without
   any external influence or accidents can have substantial psychological
   consequences regarding the integrity of one's own body especially for
   people actively engaged in sport. This aspect should be considered and
   accepted in particular during postoperative treatment.}},

   visual acuity. Demographic data, clinical features and results of
   treatment were analyzed. Results: Mean age at presentation was 61.06
   years. Mean follow up was 18 months. The disease was more prevalent in
   males. Forty three patients had unilateral disease. The most common
   location of polyps in ICGA was subfoveal (42.5\%). Exudative form was
   seen in 34 of the 47 eyes and the remaining 13 eyes had a hemorrhagic
   presentation. Thirty four eyes underwent treatment which included
   thermal laser (n = 11), photodynamic therapy (PDT) (n = 11) and
   transpupillary thermo therapy (TTT) (n = 12). Statistical analysis was
   done using the Chi-square test. Subgroup analysis of visual outcome
   following various modalities of treatment showed that the results of PDT
   (P < 0.001) and thermal laser (P < 0.001) were statistically
   significant. Conclusions: PCV is an important differential diagnosis in
   patients presenting with serosanginous maculopathy and submacular
   hemorrhage. The disease was more prevalent in males and was unilateral
   in the Indian population. Timely intervention in cases with symptomatic
   polyps could achieve stabilization of visual acuity. Thermal laser and
   PDT were safe and effective.}},

Abstract = {{The timely and accurate noninvasive assessment of peripheral arterial
   disease is a critical component of a limb preservation initiative in
   patients with diabetes mellitus. Noninvasive vascular studies can be
   useful in screening patients with diabetes for peripheral arterial
   disease. In patients with clinical signs or symptoms, noninvasive
   vascular studies provide crucial information on the presence, location,
   and severity of peripheral arterial disease and an objective assessment
   of the potential for primary healing of an index wound or a surgical
   incision. Appropriately selected noninvasive vascular studies are
   important in the decision-making process to determine whether and what
   type of intervention might be most appropriate given the clinical
   circumstances. Hemodynamic monitoring is likewise important after either
   an endovascular procedure or a surgical bypass. Surveillance studies,
   usually with a combination of physiologic testing and imaging with
   duplex ultrasound, accurately identify recurrent disease before the
   occurrence of thrombosis, allowing targeted reintervention. Noninvasive
   vascular studies can be broadly grouped into three general categories:
   physiologic or hemodynamic measurements, anatomical imaging, and
   measurements of tissue perfusion. These types of tests and suggestions
   for their appropriate application in patients with diabetes are
   reviewed. (J Am Podiatr Med Assoc 100(5): 406-411, 2010)}},

Abstract = {{North American beavers (Castor canadensis) were introduced to Tierra del
   Fuego Island in 1946 for their fur, and have since spread across the
   archipelago and onto the South American mainland. We assessed the impact
   of invasive beavers on streams of these forested watersheds by
   quantifying the trophic basis of production (TBP) and consumptive
   organic matter flows of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. TBP was
   determined in two streams: clear- and black-water. Stable isotopes were
   used across four streams to further elucidate food web structure and
   dominant pathways. TBP and stable isotopes showed that terrestrially
   derived organic matter (amorphous detritus, leaves, and wood) supported
   a majority of secondary production in the benthic food webs at all sites
   (forested reaches, beaver ponds, and sections downstream of ponds with
   foraged riparian zones). The magnitude of these flows was enhanced in
   beaver-modified sites compared with forested habitats (4.0-5.3x increase
   g AFDM m(-2) year(-1) in pond habitats, 1.1-2.1x increase in downstream
   habitats). Diatoms were the only autochthonous resource identified in
   macroinvertebrate guts, but their contribution to secondary production
   was small. Consumptive flows mirrored trends in TBP (i.e., dominance of
   terrestrial sources and greater magnitude in beaver ponds).
   Collector-gatherer consumption of amorphous detrital material dominated
   food web flows in all habitats, but was higher in beaver ponds relative
   to other habitats. Food web structure was simplified in beaver ponds;
   only two of the five possible functional groups contributed > 1\% of
   total organic matter flow in ponds (collector-gatherers and predators).
   Consumptive flows to predators increased in ponds, and stable isotopes
   of nitrogen and carbon (delta N-15 and delta C-13) corroborated a
   relatively greater importance of predators (greater trophic distance),
   as well as less diversity of basal resources (less variation in delta
   C-13) in ponds. Our findings indicate that invasive beaver's engineering
   activities resulted in greater flows of terrestrial organic matter
   subsidies to in-stream food webs, which had a relatively greater change
   in the clear-water than in the black-water stream. Owing to the fact
   that these streams were naturally dependent on allochthonous resources
   for a majority of production and material flows, changes wrought by
   beavers to streams in forested environments are probably less than in
   watersheds with inherently greater dependence on autochthonous
   production such as the adjacent steppe biome.}},

Abstract = {{The Honduran Emerald Amazilia luciae is endemic to dry forests of
   Honduras and currently recognised as `Critically Endangered.' Here we
   present the first modern assessment of its distribution, ecology, and
   conservation, based partly on our rediscovery of the species in western
   Honduras and on our observations in three Honduran departments. We found
   that dry forests inhabited by the emerald differed in structure and
   species composition between eastern and western Honduras, where we
   observed emeralds in open-canopied deciduous thorn forests and
   closed-canopied semi-deciduous woodlands, respectively. We interpret
   these differences in light of the geological and anthropogenic origins
   of dry forests in Honduras, and discuss the implications of such origins
   for the conservation of dry forests. Although our findings expand the
   known distribution and population size of the species, its status as
   `Critically Endangered' is warranted due to its restricted distribution
   in dry forest fragments and increasing human pressures on this habitat.}},

Title = {{Reproducibility of the airway response to an exercise protocol
   standardized for intensity, duration, and inspired air conditions, in
   subjects with symptoms suggestive of asthma}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Exercise testing to aid diagnosis of exercise-induced
   bronchoconstriction (EIB) is commonly performed. Reproducibility of the
   airway response to a standardized exercise protocol has not been
   reported in subjects being evaluated with mild symptoms suggestive of
   asthma but without a definite diagnosis. This study examined
   reproducibility of \% fall in FEV(1) and area under the FEV(1) time
   curve for 30 minutes in response to two exercise tests performed with
   the same intensity and duration of exercise, and inspired air
   conditions.
   Methods: Subjects with mild symptoms of asthma exercised twice within
   approximately 4 days by running for 8 minutes on a motorized treadmill
   breathing dry air at an intensity to induce a heart rate between 80-90\%
   predicted maximum; reproducibility of the airway response was expressed
   as the 95\% probability interval.
   Results: Of 373 subjects challenged twice 161 were positive (>= 10\%
   fall FEV(1) on at least one challenge). The EIB was mild and 77\% of
   subjects had <15\% fall on both challenges. Agreement between results
   was 76.1\% with 56.8\% (212) negative (< 10\% fall FEV(1)) and 19.3\%
   (72) positive on both challenges. The remaining 23.9\% of subjects had
   only one positive test. The 95\% probability interval for
   reproducibility of the \% fall in FEV1 and AUC(0-30) min was +/- 9.7\%
   and +/- 251\% for all 278 adults and +/- 13.4\% and +/- 279\% for all 95
   children. The 95\% probability interval for reproducibility of \% fall
   in FEV(1) and AUC0-30 min for the 72 subjects with two tests = 10\% fall
   FEV1 was +/- 14.6\% and +/- 373\% and for the 34 subjects with two tests
   = 15\% fall FEV(1) it was +/- 12.2\% and +/- 411\%. Heart rate and
   estimated ventilation achieved were not significantly different either
   on the two test days or when one test result was positive and one was
   negative.
   Conclusions: Under standardized, well controlled conditions for exercise
   challenge, the majority of subjects with mild symptoms of asthma
   demonstrated agreement in test results. Performing two tests may need to
   be considered when using exercise to exclude or diagnose EIB, when
   prescribing prophylactic treatment to prevent EIB and when designing
   protocols for clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{The excess pressure losses due to end effects (mainly entrance) in the
   capillary flow of several types of polyethylenes were studied both
   experimentally and numerically under slip and no-slip conditions. These
   losses were first measured as a function of the contraction angle
   ranging from 15 to 90. It was found that the excess pressure loss
   attains a local minimum at a contraction angle of about 300 for all
   types of polyethylenes examined. This was found to be independent of the
   apparent shear rate. This minimum. becomes more dominant under slip
   conditions that were imposed by adding a significant amount of
   fluoropolymer into the polymer. Numerical simulations using a multimode
   K-BKZ viscoelastic model have shown that the entrance pressure drops can
   be predicted fairly well for all cases either under slip or no-slip
   boundary conditions. The clear experimental minimum at about 30 can only
   slightly be seen in numerical simulations, and at this point its origin
   is unknown. Further simulations with a viscous (Cross) model have shown
   that they severely under-predict the entrance pressure by an order of
   magnitude for the more elastic melts. Thus, the viscoelastic spectrum
   together with the extensional viscosity play a significant role in
   predicting the pressure drop in contraction flows, as no viscous model
   could. The larger the average relaxation time and the extensional
   viscosity are, the higher the differences in the predictions between the
   K-KBZ and Cross models are.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines civil society strengthening experience in
   Indonesia to illuminate issues, challenges, and lessons for
   non-governmental organization (NGO) capacity building and international
   donor-supported democratic reform. The authors conceive of capacity as a
   function of contextual factors, and internal factors associated with an
   individual NGO or a network of NGOs. Contextual factors that need to be
   taken into account in Indonesia include weak reform implementation,
   state distrust of NGOs, and backsliding on some basic freedoms. Among
   the important internal features of NGOs in democracy promotion are
   overreliance on confrontational advocacy strategies, shallow
   organizational capacity, inability to cooperate to leverage impact,
   limited outreach to indigenous constituencies and sustainability
   problems. Indonesia's democracy-promotion NGO coalitions have largely
   operated as instruments of donor-supported reforms. As they seek to
   become socially embedded actors pursuing indigenous agendas, they face
   the need to confront the various expectations of their stakeholders
   regarding their roles and legitimacy, develop flexibility to respond to
   new engagements with government and with citizens, and address their
   internal capacity gaps. Three cases are presented that illustrate both
   the problems and the encouraging progress with government-NGO
   collaborations in democratic governance.}},

Abstract = {{In the coastal pine forests (Pinus pinea and Pinus pinaster) of Ravenna

   In this paper we present ground elevation, depth to watertable, salinity
   of groundwater and vegetation species richness data within one of the
   coastal pine forests and some wetlands north of the Bevano River between
   LAT. 44 degrees 23'10{''} and LAT. 44 degrees 20'21{''} and between
   LONG. 12 degrees 17'25{''} and LONG. 12 degrees 19'33{''}. The data are
   presented areally and along a 50 m long transect perpendicular to the
   coast to study the cause of distress in the pine forest and in different
   water pools within the wetlands. The findings were compared to published
   values of tolerance to salinity for 39 plant species typical of the area
   and incorporated into a web application to help nature managers in
   assessing or adjusting water salinity in relation to the vegetation
   species present. The pine trees are relatively tolerant to salinity (up
   to 12 g/l) but cannot survive a shallow watertable. On the other hand,
   species richness or biodiversity in this area is promoted by a shallow
   watertable and low salinity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Von Willebrand's disease is an inherited bleeding disorder with a
   prevalence as high as 1\% in the general population. The disease is
   caused by the quantitative deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand
   factor (VWF), a large multimeric glycoprotein. VWF has two main
   functions in hemostasis: it is essential for platelet-plug formation as
   an adhesion protein and it forms a non-covalent complex with coagulation
   factor VIII in plasma, thereby protecting it from inactivation and
   clearance. Inherited Von Willebrand's disease has been subdivided into 3
   categories that reflect pathophysiology: partial quantitative deficiency
   of VWF (Type 1), qualitative deficiency (Type 2) and total deficiency
   (Type 3). The major clinical hallmark in Von Willebrand's disease is an
   increased tendency to mucocutaneous bleeding. Increased bleeding may
   also occur in sites such as muscles and joints when the level of factor
   VIII is particularly low. The mainstays of therapy are desmopressin,
   which induces secretion of autologous factor VIII and VWF into plasma,
   and plasma concentrates, which supply allogenic forms of these moieties.
   Other forms of treatment can be considered as adjunctive to these.}},

Abstract = {{The fluvio-lacustrine sequence in the Nihewan Basin is an important
   archive of Pleistocene climate and environmental changes in northern
   China, which provides excellent sources of early human settlements in
   high-latitude East Asia. Here a long-term environmental record from the
   Pleistocene fluvio-lacustrine sequence in this basin is revealed, based
   on selected major element pairs that are sensitive to paleoenvironmental
   changes. Results reveal a long-term increasing trend in
   aridification/cooling in the Nihewan Basin since the early Pleistocene.
   This provides a general setting for early human colonization in
   high-latitude northern China (around 40 degrees N). The intensified
   aridification/cooling is envisaged to reduce tree cover and increase
   open savanna grass area. This, in turn, would promote prominent
   flourishing population and migration of savanna-adapted early humans in
   the Old World. Therefore, the cold/dry climate may have contributed to
   the evolution and expansion of early humans in the high-latitude
   northern China, rather than bringing hardship, as is often thought. (C)

Abstract = {{The lentiviral vector is a promising tool for human gene therapy because
   of its ability to transduce genes into many cell types. However, one of
   the technical problems associated with the lentiviral vector is that
   lentiviral titers in current production systems are relatively low
   compared with the other viral vectors. In this study, we provide genetic
   evidence that the attachment of heterologous myristoylation (myr)
   signals on the amino-terminus of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
   Pr55(Gag) (Gag) can increase the viral yield up to 10-fold, leading to
   the enhancement of gene transduction in many cell lines. The myr signal
   Gag constructs behaved similarly to the wild-type Gag in targeting to
   detergent-resistant membrane compartments, Vps4-dependence for viral
   budding, and virion morphology. However, the myr signal Gag constructs
   showed improved oligomerization efficiency as measured by
   bioluminescence resonance energy transfer in living cells, contributing
   to increased viral production and efficient activation of the viral
   protease responsible for virion maturation. The genetically modified Gag
   represents the next generation lentiviral vector, and should contribute
   to the success of many lentiviral vector applications. Gene Therapy

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3323-3328}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{While regions of the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) are known to be
   selective for objects relative to feature-matched controls, it is not
   known what set of cues or configurations are used to promote this
   selectivity. Many theories of perceptual organization have emphasized
   the figure-ground relationship as being especially important in
   object-level processing. In the present work we studied the role of
   perceptual organization in eliciting visual evoked potentials from the
   object selective LOC. To do this, we used two-region stimuli in which
   the regions were modulated at different temporal frequencies and were
   comprised of either symmetric or asymmetric arrangements. The asymmetric
   arrangement produced an unambiguous figure-ground relationship
   consistent with a smaller figure region surrounded by a larger
   background, while four different symmetric arrangements resulted in
   ambiguous figure-ground relationships but still possessed strong kinetic
   boundaries between the regions. The surrounded figure-ground arrangement
   evoked greater activity in the LOC relative to first-tier visual areas
   (V1-V3). Response selectivity in the LOC, however, was not present for
   the four different types of symmetric stimuli. These results suggest
   that kinetic texture boundaries alone are not sufficient to trigger
   selective processing in the LOC, but that the spatial configuration of a
   figure that is surrounded by a larger background is both necessary and
   sufficient to selectively activate the LOC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the association of T2
   relaxation times of the knee with early degenerative cartilage changes.
   Furthermore the impact of unloading the knee on T2 values was evaluated.
   Methods: Forty-three patients with knee pain and an ICRS (International
   Cartilage Repair Society) cartilage defect grade <= 2 were examined with
   3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Morphological cartilage grading
   was based on high-resolution proton-density (PD), turbo-spin-echo (TSE)
   and three-dimensional (3D) isotropic True fast imaging with steady-state
   precession (FISP) images of slices covering the cartilage layer above
   the posterior horn of the meniscus. T2 maps were calculated from a
   multi-echo, spin-echo (MESE) sequence, performed at the beginning and at
   the end of the scan (time interval 40 min). Influence of cartilage
   defect grading on deep, superficial, and global T2 values as well as on
   T2 values for zonal variation was assessed using analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) and Spearman rank correlation test. Differences among both T2
   measurements were compared using paired t-test.
   Results: Global and superficial T2 values significantly increased with
   cartilage defect grade regardless of the time elapsed from unloading
   (global T2: ICRS grade 0, 38.9 and 40.1 ms; grade 1, 41.2 and 44.5 ms;
   grade 2, 47.7 and 53.4 ms; P=0.041 and 0.008) with stronger correlation
   for second T2 measurement. In contrast there were no significant
   differences among grades in the zonal variation at any time. Significant
   differences for T2 values between the two subsequent measurements were
   consistently found.
   Conclusion: T2 mapping might be a sensitive method for the detection of
   early cartilage degeneration. From our results we would recommend to
   measure T2 after unloading. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of foreign workers on labor market
   outcomes for Palestinian workers in the Israeli labor market. The paper
   utilizes a micro-dataset on the Palestinian labor force combined with
   time-series data on foreign workers in Israel. The data covers the
   period 1999-2003, a period in which Israel enforced a strict closure on
   labor (and goods) movement, particularly in 2001 and 2002. The evidence
   suggests that foreign workers in Israel do not affect Palestinian
   employment; however, an increase in the number of foreign workers in
   Israel tends to reduce Israeli wages paid to Palestinian workers from
   the Gaza Strip. The Israeli closure policy appears to be the main cause
   for the substantial reduction in long-run Palestinian employment levels
   in Israel, not the presence of foreign workers.}},

Abstract = {{The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data have confirmed the pulsed
   emission from all six high-confidence gamma-ray pulsars previously known
   from the EGRET observations. We report results obtained from the
   analysis of 13 months of LAT data for three of these pulsars (PSR
   J1057-5226, PSR J1709-4429, and PSR 11952+3252) each of which had some
   unique feature among the EGRET pulsars. The excellent sensitivity of LAT
   allows more detailed analysis of the evolution of the pulse profile with
   energy and also of the variation of the spectral shape with phase. We
   measure the cutoff energy of the pulsed emission from these pulsars for
   the first time and provide a more complete picture of the emission
   mechanism. The results confirm some, but not all, of the features seen
   in the EGRET data.}},

Abstract = {{Testing of filament-wound composites (FWC) with simplified methods is
   studied until now in order to generalize the mechanical response of FWC
   structures. To assure a good analogy between meso- and macro scales, it
   is necessary to design a representative specimen that include the
   characteristic winding pattern. This research aims at characterizing the
   strain field of FWC pattern at +/-55 degrees using flat specimens by
   measuring the displacement field with digital image correlation.
   Experimental procedure involves tensile testing of epoxy/glass specimens
   with two unit cells aligned at hoop and axial direction of the winding
   pattern. Validation of the strain values from digital image correlation
   is carried out by comparing them with strain gauge measurements and FEM
   simulations. Failure sequence and modes of FWC flat unit cells show good
   concordance with those observed in FWC cylinders exposed to buckling in
   previous works {[}1]. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lymph node involvement is the most important predictor of survival rates
   in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). A biomarker that
   can indicate lymph node metastasis would be valuable to classify
   patients with OSCC for optimal treatment. In this study, we have
   performed a serum proteomic analysis of OSCC using 2-D gel
   electrophoresis and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. One
   of the down-regulated proteins in OSCC was identified as tetranectin,
   which is a protein encoded by the CLEC3B gene (C-type lectin domain
   family 3, member B). We further tested the protein level in serum and
   saliva from patients with lymph-node metastatic and primary OSCC.
   Tetranectin was found significantly under-expressed in both serum and
   saliva of metastatic OSCC compared to primary OSCC. Our results suggest
   that serum or saliva tetranectin may serve as a potential biomarker for
   metastatic OSCC. Other candidate serum biomarkers for OSCC included
   superoxide dismutase, ficolin 2, CD-5 antigen-like protein, RalA binding
   protein 1, plasma retinol-binding protein and transthyretin. Their
   clinical utility for OSCC detection remains to be further tested in

Title = {{COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS OF TWO SPECIES OF FRESHWATER TURTLES, A

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Under low-resource conditions, the outcome of competition between a
   generalist omnivore and an herbivore may depend on whether one species
   can more efficiently, use a limiting resource. I evaluated the levels of
   omnivory and competitive interactions between two abundant sympatric
   emydid turtles, Trachemys scripta and Pseudemys floridana, that coexist
   across a productivity gradient in lakes in northern Florida. A foraging
   experiment indicated that both species were omnivorous in the juvenile
   stage, but P. floridana was more herbivorous and T. scripta consumed
   more insects and carrion. This low level of resource overlap was
   consistent with previous studies of gut contents and stable isotope
   analyses. In a 13-mo enclosure experiment in a natural pond under
   low-resource conditions, the generalist T. scripta grew more slowly with
   conspecifics than with P. floridana, and the more specialized P.
   floridana grew at the same rate with both T. scripta and conspecifics.
   Trachemys scripta with P. floridana exhibited the highest growth rate
   (3.5 mm/yr), slightly faster than P. floridana with conspecifics (2.3
   mm/yr). Trachemys scripta was apparently unable to process macroalgae as
   well as P. floridana and the low abundance of invertebrate prey in the
   pond may have limited growth rates with conspecifics. Where only
   low-quality, basal resources are available, gut specializations in P.
   floridana allow for more efficient digestion and assimilation of plant
   nutrients and maintenance of equal growth rates with either conspecifics
   or T. scripta. Where intraspecific competition in one species is
   stronger than interspecific effects, this may influence the distribution
   of trophic generalists across a productivity gradient. A possible
   mechanism for competition among conspecifics may be aggressive
   interactions in habitats with limited resources.}},

Abstract = {{Recent investigations Arguelles et al. (2008) {[}5] have demonstrated
   that it is possible to increase the operative angular range of pneumatic
   three-hole pressure probes (THP) using a two-zoned method in the data
   reduction procedure. In this study, the influence of the head geometry
   on the performance of this type of probes is addressed, especially in
   the extended regions of the angular range, previously unconsidered in
   the literature. Three different geometries have been built to carry out
   the analysis, corresponding to cylindrical, trapezoidal and cobra type
   probes, with a separation angle of 60 degrees between the holes.
   Additionally, cylindrical and cobra type probes have been manufactured
   with angular distances of 30 degrees and 45 degrees between the holes,
   in order to advance the effect of the construction angle on the probes
   performance. The uncertainty transmitted from the measurements to the
   resultant flow variables has been also addressed. Moreover, the
   sensitivity of the different head designs to variations in the Reynolds
   number or deviations of the flow with respect to the measurement plane
   of the probe (pitch misalignments) has been addressed. Major conclusions
   indicate that cobra type probes provide the largest operative angular
   range, while cylindrical designs minimize the errors in the
   determination of both pressure and velocity flow variables when the
   Reynolds number or the pitch angle differ from the baseline calibration.

Abstract = {{Adult ails display taste avoidance and disgust reactions when stimulated
   with gustatory stimuli previously paired with aversive agents such as
   lithium chloride (LiCl) By the second postnatal week of life,
   preweanling rats also display specific behaviors in response to a
   tastant conditioned stimulus (CS) that predicts LICI-induced malaise The
   present study compared conditioned disgust reactions induced by LiCl or
   ethanol (EtOH) in preweanling rats In Experiment I we determined doses
   of ethanol and LiCl that exert similar levels of conditioned taste
   avoidance. After having equated drug dosage in terms of conditioned
   taste avoidance, 13-day-old rats were given a single pairing of a novel
   taste (saccharin) and either LiCl or ethanol (2 5 g/kg, Experiment 2)
   Saccharin intake and emission of disgust reactions were assessed 24 and
   48 hr after training Pups given paired presentations of saccharin and
   the aversive agents (ethanol or LiCl consumed less saccharin during the
   first testing clay than controls These pups also showed more aversive
   behavioral reactions to the gustatory CS than controls. Specifically,
   increased amounts of grooming, general activity, head shaking. and wall
   climbing as well as reduced mouthing were observed in response to the CS
   Conditioned aversive reactions but not taste avoidance were still
   evident on the second testing day In conclusion, a taste CS paired with
   postabsorptive effects of EtOH and LiCl elicited a similar pattern of
   conditioned rejection reactions in preweanling rats These results
   suggest that similar mechanisms may be underlying CTAs induced by LiCl
   and a relatively high EtOH dose (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc Dev.

Abstract = {{Introduction and aim: The mechanisms of acromegalic cardiomyopathy are
   not clearly understood. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal
   fragment of its pro-hormone (NT-proBNP) are released by the cardiac
   ventricles and increase in heart failure. In the present study, we aimed
   to evaluate serum NT-proBNP levels in acromegalic patients and determine
   a relationship between NT-proBNP levels and echocardiographic
   parameters. Subjects and methods: Twenty-two newly diagnosed acromegalic
   patients {[}mean age 38.85 +/- 11.06 yr; body mass index (BMI): 28.51
   +/- 3.48 kg/m(2)] and 26 age- and BMI-matched healthy control subjects
   (mean age 32.9 +/- 12.6 yr; BMI: 26.2 +/- 5.3 kg/m2) were included in
   the study. Standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed.
   Serum NT-proBNP and GH were measured at the beginning of the OGTT (0
   min). Body fat analyses were measured by bioelectrical impedance.
   Echocardiography was used in cardiac evaluations. Results: The mean
   NT-proBNP level in the acromegalic group was not significantly different
   from the control subjects (55.89 +/- 46.64 pg/ml in acromegaly vs 28.76
   +/- 22.13 pg/ml in control subjects). There were no correlations between
   the serum NT-proBNP, GH, and IGF-I levels. Echocardiography revealed
   significantly increased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter
   (p=0.008), interventricular septum thickness (p=0.009), left atrium
   (p=0.029), and right ventricle diameter (p=0.027) in the acromegalic
   group. Conclusion: NT-proBNP levels were found to be slightly higher in
   acromegalic patients as an indicator of heart failure, but the increase
   was not statistically significant. Although these cardiac structural
   changes in newly diagnosed acromegalic patients are present, the normal
   level of NT-proBNP shows that NT-proBNP may not be a good indicator in
   acromegaly. (J. Endocrinol. Invest. 33: 571-575, 2010) (C) 2010,

Abstract = {{Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) like acupuncture, herbal
   medicine and homeopathy is increasingly used in the treatment of human
   and animal disease. On the other hand, CAM is discussed controversially,

   This paper provides a balanced analysis of the currently available data
   on CAM in human and veterinary medicine. In conclusion, little rigorous
   research data concerning the efficacy and safety of CAM has been
   published. However, acupuncture is gaining increasing acceptance in
   academic medicine, based on several metaanalyses that show efficacy for
   specific conditions. In practice, decisions concerning CAM therapies
   should also be based on the best available evidence provided by
   scientifically valid data. This implies that CAM interventions must be
   validated by stringent high quality research to obtain an objective and
   replicable overview of efficacy and safety. Nevertheless, trials should
   be designed according to important aspects of CAM therapies (e. g.
   individual treatment). In conclusion, Evidence-Based Alternative
   Veterinary Medicine is not a contradiction in terms.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Heparin is used in humans as prophylaxis of hypercoagulable states and
   disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, babies need a
   higher heparin dose than do adults. Septic neonate foals are at high
   risk of hypercoagulable state and DIC, and there is limited objective
   information about heparin dose for equine neonates.
   Objective
   To assess whether neonate foals require higher dosages of
   low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) than adults.
   Animals
   Eighteen healthy and 11 septic neonate foals.
   Methods
   Experimental and clinical studies. Firstly, healthy foals were randomly
   distributed in 2 groups, 1 receiving 50 IU/kg SC of dalteparin and the
   2nd group receiving 100 IU/kg SC of dalteparin, once daily for 3 days.
   Blood samples were collected before and 3, 6, 27, and 51 hours after the
   1st LMWH administration. Plasma antifactor-Xa activity was measured,
   together with hemostatic and hematologic parameters used to assess the
   risk of bleeding. Subsequently, septic foals were treated blindly either
   with placebo (saline) or 100 IU/kg of dalteparin for 3 days. Plasma
   antifactor-Xa activity and other hemostatic parameters were determined
   before and after treatment.
   Results
   Plasma antifactor-Xa activity in healthy foals was below prophylactic
   activity when using the adult dosage (50 IU/kg), whereas prophylactic
   activities were achieved when using the double dosage (100 IU/kg). No
   hemorrhagic events and erythrocyte-related complications were observed
   with either dosage. In the clinical study, only 4/6 septic foals had
   plasma antifactor-Xa activity adequate for prophylaxis.
   Conclusions and Clinical Importance
   Equine neonates require higher dosages of LMWH compared with adults to
   reach prophylactic heparinemia.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{P>The administration of antibiotics by aerosol to horses suffering from
   respiratory infections may partially circumvent the limitations of
   antimicrobial therapy, e.g. large injection volumes, low bioavailability
   and risk of diarrhoea. Only injectable formulations are available
   currently and usually contain other substances that could irritate the
   mucosa and induce coughing and bronchospasm. In addition, the quality of
   the aerosol, particularly in terms of the delivery of antibiotics to the
   deep parts of the lung, is unknown. Although used under field
   conditions, cefquinome delivered by aerosol has never been studied in
   horses.
   This study examined the safety of cefquinome injectable solution,
   administered by aerosol at a dose of 225 mg/inhalation to 7 healthy
   horses, by assessing (1) pulmonary function before and 15 min after a
   single inhalation, at the first day (Day 1) and the fifth day (Day 5) of
   a 5 day period treatment; and (2) the inflammatory status of the lung,
   i.e. percentage neutrophils and myeloperoxidase concentration, based on
   bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at D1 and D5. In addition, cefquinome
   concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after
   aerosol, intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administrations.
   A single aerosol of cefquinome injectable solution did not induce any
   immediate nor delayed pulmonary side effects in healthy horses and
   produced cefquinome concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
   within 30 min that were higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration
   of the main equine respiratory pathogens. These results should stimulate
   further studies, especially in horses suffering from bronchial
   hyper-reactivity. Aerosol delivery of antibiotics may well have a role
   in equine therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{The South American sea lion, Otaria flavescens, is widely distributed
   along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of South America. However, along
   the Brazilian coast, there are only two nonbreeding sites for the
   species (Refugio de Vida Silvestre da Ilha dos Lobos and Refugio de Vida
   Silvestre do Molhe Leste da Barra do Rio Grande), both in Southern
   Brazil. In this region, the species is continuously under the effect of
   anthropic activities, mainly those related to environmental
   contamination with organic and inorganic chemicals and fishery
   interactions. This paper reports, for the first time, the genetic
   diversity of O. flavescens found along the Southern Brazilian coast. A
   287-bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region (D-loop) was
   analyzed. Seven novel haplotypes were found in 56 individuals
   (OFA1-OFA7), with OFA1 being the most frequent (47.54\%). Nucleotide
   diversity was moderate (pi = 0.62\%) and haplotype diversity was
   relatively low (67\%). Furthermore, the median joining network analysis
   indicated that Brazilian haplotypes formed a reciprocal monophyletic
   clade when compared to the haplotypes from the Peruvian population on
   the Pacific coast. These two populations do not share haplotypes and may
   have become isolated some time back. Further genetic studies covering
   the entire species distribution are necessary to better understand the
   biological implications of the results reported here for the management
   and conservation of South American sea lions.}},

Abstract = {{In this experimental study, the usability of waste marble dust (WMD) as
   an additive material in blended cement has been investigated. For this
   purpose, waste marble dust added cements (WMDCs) have been obtained by
   intergrinding WMD with Portland cement clinker at different blend
   ratios: 2.5\%, 5.0\%, 7.5\% and 10\% by weight. 40 x 40 x 160 mm mortar
   prisms have been produced with the obtained cements. Strength tests have
   been carried out on mortar specimen at 7, 28, and 90 days. WMDCs have
   been compared to each other as well as to control cements of CEM I and
   CEM II with respect to their physical, chemical and mechanical
   properties. Obtained results showed that WMDCs conform to EN 197-1
   standard and thus 10\% WMD can be used as an additive material in cement
   manufacturing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   degradation. The first author modified Barton's original model in order
   to address these limitations. In this study, the modified Barton's model
   (the peak shear displacement, the shear stress-displacement curve, and
   the dilation displacement) is validated by conducting a series of direct

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To study spherical aberration, coma, and trefoil after
   implantation of a single-piece aspheric Tecnis intraocular lens (IOL) in
   cataract patients and the influence on photopic and mesopic contrast
   sensitivity.
   SETTING: Ophthalmology Department, Ain-Shams University Hospitals,
   Cairo, Egypt.
   METHODS: In this randomized prospective contralateral comparative study,
   patients had bilateral senile cataract Eyes with a pathological
   condition other than cataract that might influence postoperative visual
   function were excluded The aspheric IOL was compared with the Sensar
   AR40e spherical IOL The IOL selection was randomized. Study criteria
   included corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), wavefront aberrometry,
   and contrast visual acuity
   RESULTS: Fifty-six eyes of 28 patients were enrolled All patients
   completed the 2-month postoperative visit There was no significant
   difference between the IOLs in CDVA (P> 05) Ocular spherical aberration
   was significantly lower with aspheric IOLs than spherical IOLs (P<.001).
   Two months after surgery, eyes with the aspheric IOL had better photopic
   contrast sensitivity and better mesopic contrast sensitivity at all
   cycles per degree. There was no significant difference in 3rd-order
   aberrations (coma and trefoil) between IOLs.
   CONCLUSIONS: After cataract surgery, the single-piece aspheric IOL
   resulted in significantly lower ocular spherical aberration and
   significantly better mesopic contrast sensitivity. No significant
   difference in 3rd-order aberrations indicates that both IOLs had
   satisfactory centration in the capsular bag.

Abstract = {{Splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) are the third most common forms of
   intra-abdominal aneurysm, and the most commonly encountered visceral
   aneurysms in the general population. SAAs occur more commonly in
   patients with portal hypertension and liver failure and, as such, are
   often encountered in patients undergoing high-resolution abdominal
   imaging as part of a work-up for liver transplantation. While rupture
   rates of between 2\% and 10\% have been reported in the literature,
   little is known about the natural history and behavior of these lesions
   in patients with liver disease. Interventional management options pose a
   challenge given the high anesthetic and surgical risk of such patients.
   This study was conducted to study the management of all SAAs diagnosed
   among patients presenting for a liver transplant assessment at a single
   center over a three-yr period. We discuss the presentation and
   management options, with elective and emergent presentation of SAA in
   patients with end-stage liver disease.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of tumor immunology is to understand the interactions between
   tumor cells and immune system, and ultimately to devise immune
   basedapproaches to fight cancer. We discuss here recent advances in
   tumor immunology and in the interaction between immunology and
   informatics that provide new perspectives for the development of cancer
   therapy. Cancer immunoprevention is a novel approach to cancer
   prevention through the use of vaccines and other immunological
   strategies to be applied before tumor onset. The efficacy of cancer
   immunoprevention has been demonstrated in several experimental systems,
   however, as frequently happens in novel approaches, cancer
   immunoprevention studies incorporate a large number of variables. We
   show here how a specifically designed lattice gas model can provide
   significant insight for the analysis of immune variables and the design
   of new biological experiments. A second approach that provides new
   perspectives in tumor immunology as the result of interactions between
   immunology and informatics is the use of DNA microarrays to investigate
   and monitor tumor-host relationships and modifications induced by
   immunopreventive and immunotherapeutic interventions.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we illustrate a methodology able to follow and study
   concurrent and simultaneous brain processes during cooperation between
   individuals, with non invasive EEG methodologies. We collected data from
   fourteen pairs of subjects while they were playing a card game with EEG.
   Data collection was made simultaneously on all the subjects during the
   card game. An extension of the Granger-causality approach allows us to
   estimate the functional connection between signals estimated from
   different Regions of Interest (ROIs) in different brains during the
   analyzed task. Finally, with the use of graph theory, we contrast the
   functional connectivity patterns of the two players belonging to the
   same team. Statistically significant functional connectivities were
   obtained from signals estimated in the ROIs modeling the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) and the prefrontal areas described by the
   Brodmann areas 8 with the signals estimated in all the other modelled
   cortical areas. Results presented suggested the existence of
   Granger-sense causal relations between the EEG activity estimated in the
   prefrontal areas 8 and 9/46 of one player with the EEG activity
   estimated in the ACC of their companion. We illustrated the feasibility
   of functional connectivity methodology on the EEG hyperscannings
   performed on a group of subjects. These functional connectivity
   estimated from the couple of brains could suggest, in statistical and
   mathematical terms, the modelled cortical areas that are correlated in
   Granger-sense during the solution of a particular task. EEG
   hyperscannings could be used to investigate experimental paradigms where
   the knowledge of the simultaneous interactions between the subjects have
   a value.}},

Abstract = {{Because hand surgeons frequently see patients with arm and hand pain,
   numbness, and tingling, it is important for them to recognize the
   possibility of the presence of thoracic outlet compression syndrome
   (TOGS). Approximately 40\% to 50\% of patients with this condition have
   associated peripheral nerve compression symptoms. Only about 10\% of
   patients with suspected TOCS might show some objective evidence during
   physical examination and other examination modalities. For this reason,
   TOCS is one of the most overlooked, misdiagnosed, and underrated
   conditions. During the past 20 years (1989-2009) our surgical experience
   with combined-approach surgery for TOCS, involving transaxillary first
   rib resection followed by immediate transcervical anterior and middle
   scalenectomy, has been gratifying. During this period, more than 750
   patients had this combined procedure. Between the end of 1989 and 2002
   (13 years), 532 patients (many of whom were from out of state) had this
   kind of intervention. At the end of 2002, we surveyed our patients for
   the outcome of their surgery. Unfortunately, we were able to locate only
   358 patients, and only 102 patients returned a mailed questionnaire.
   About 95 patients reported improvement of their symptoms. Since the
   beginning of 2003, more than 230 patients have had the same procedure.
   It is our impression that the outcome of the surgery in this last group
   of patients is at least as good as (if not better than) the earlier
   reported outcome in the first group of patients. The combined surgical
   approach to TOCS with transaxillary first rib resection and
   transcervical scalenectomy is the most complete procedure for total
   decompression of the thoracic outlet, with a much better rate of
   improvement of symptoms and a lower rate of recurrences. The surgical
   techniques of these two procedures are described. (J Hand Surg 2010;

Abstract = {{Gestures are an important modality for human machine communication.
   Computer vision modules performing gesture recognition can be important
   components of intelligent homes, assistive environments, and human
   computer interfaces. A key problem in recognizing gestures is that the
   appearance of a gesture can vary widely depending on variables such as
   the person performing the gesture, or the position and orientation of
   the camera. This paper presents a database-based approach for addressing
   this problem. The large variability in appearance among different
   examples of the same gesture is addressed by creating large gesture
   databases, that store enough exemplars from each gesture to capture the
   variability within that gesture. This database-based approach is applied
   to two gesture recognition problems: handshape categorization and
   motion-based recognition of American Sign Language signs. A key aspect
   of our approach is the use of database indexing methods, in order to
   address the challenge of searching large databases without violating the
   time constraints of an online interactive system, where system response
   times of over a few seconds are oftentimes considered unacceptable. Our
   experiments demonstrate the benefits of the proposed database-based
   framework, and the feasibility of integrating large gesture databases
   into online interacting systems.}},

Abstract = {{The M 5.0 23 June 2010 Val-des-Bois, Quebec, earthquake produced a rich
   instrumental and felt ground-motion database. We use
   instrument-corrected response spectra and Fourier amplitude data from
   120 stations, at distances from 60 to 1,000 km, to examine the
   attenuation and source characteristics of this important event. The
   Val-des-Bois earthquake produced relatively large response spectral
   amplitudes at distances less than 200 km, greater than predicted by most
   recent ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) (including the
   Atkinson and Boore 2006 equations). By contrast, reported intensities at
   regional distances tended to be smaller than predicted by intensity
   GMPEs (Atkinson and Wald 2007), although they were high in the
   epicentral area. From recent moderate earthquakes in eastern North
   America (ENA) (2010 Val-des-Bois and the 2005 Riviere du Loup event), we
   have learned that amplitudes at near distances are not well-predicted by
   average attenuation shapes drawn to pass through regional observations.
   To infer the source spectrum or near-source motions, we suggest the use
   of seismic moment as a constraint on the level of the source spectrum.
   Using Q-corrected observations to deduce the source-spectral shape, and
   the known seismic moment to fix its absolute amplitude level, we obtain
   an apparent source spectrum for the Val-des-Bois earthquake. The
   Val-des-Bois source spectrum is well described by a Brune model with a
   stress drop of 250 bars. Future work will focus on resolving near-source
   attenuation issues to provide better GMPEs for ENA for all magnitudes.}},

Title = {{Internet and suicidality. A googling study about mediatic view of a

Journal = {{ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{168}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{502-507}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The communication via the Internet does not stop developing in a more
   and more mediatized society. On reaction to a suicide pact recently
   concluded on line, the media wondered about the responsibility of the
   Internet as promoter of suicide. When a suicide pact is decided on the
   Internet between two subjects which never saw each other previously but
   which meet to die: We speak about ``cybersuicide{''} or ``net
   suicide{''}. This modern practice would be increased. The suicide pact
   is an outstanding event, which is intensely mediatized in Web sites
   dedicated to journalism (on-line press). The authors established a
   review of the literature on the links between Internet and suicidality.
   In a first part, they evoke the epidemiological and psychopathological
   determiners of the cybersuicide. Particularly isolated subjects in real
   life can find a morbid comfort on the Net, and develop a real addiction
   to a cyberrelation. The victims often suffer from a narcissistic gap
   imaginating in the other one an ultimate propping up in a mutual
   accompaniment towards the death. Several authors evoked fora long time
   the impact of the media communication on the suicide as a supplier or a
   defender of suicide in the readers of newspapper's articles. The authors
   expose the results of a ``googling study{''} asking itself the way how
   the media available on the Web reported the cybersuicide realized near
   the town of Toul. Are the recommendations of the OMS on the way of
   telling in the media of a suicidal fact respected? On ten visited on
   line press sites, only one takes the opportunity of the event to educate
   the general population about the suicide fact. In most cases, the
   address and phone number of crisis' center are not mentioned, the
   information on the localization of the drama is too precise, the
   presented photos are shocking and the suicidal event doesn't take place
   in a more diverse current events. In a last part, the authors tackle the
   increasing interest of the Web when it's use in purposes of prevention.
   It would be advisable to reaffirm the legal view to condemn the settled
   cybercrime known as promotion of suicide. If the Web can sometimes be
   dangerous for the Internet users, it is also a tremendous potential for
   suicide prevention. The sites of prevention have to inform the general
   population, help establishing databases for the professionals of health
   and still realize epidemiological inquiries. The Internet programs of
   prevention for patients with suicidal tendencies were established at the
   same time as the concept of ``telephone help line{''}. The therapeutic
   and preventive potential of the Web is situated in a logic of bifocal
   treatment - and not in a rivalry - with the traditional
   psychotherapeutic approach. The links between Internet and suicidality
   are emergent, complex and little studied. Far thinking that the Web is a
   place of no law where everything would be possible, some regulations
   should be able to be imposed by authorities to preserve the public
   health. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Public involvement is increasingly becoming the norm as stakeholders
   recognize the need to inform, consult and engage the public. However,
   there is limited understanding about the meaning and implications of
   public involvement, in particular elements like the levels of public
   involvement, the goals of the involvement, the type of public to be
   involved, the methods of involving the public and the need to assess
   effectiveness. We conducted a systematic review of policy
   documents/guidelines published between 1998 and 2009, by governments,
   health professionals and the public regarding public involvement in the
   area of human genomics. Documents were identified using the HUMGEN
   database and organizational web sites. A total of 70 documents were
   retrieved addressing public involvement and human genomics. The review
   revealed that 22 documents mentioned the active process of partnership
   and collaboration, whereas 27 mentioned consultation and 29 mentioned
   education. The most common goals were building trust and respect,
   followed by education, governance and lastly, understanding risks and
   benefits. We found that less than a third of the documents defined who
   the public is, and when mechanisms for public involvement were
   mentioned, they were rarely placed into a context. Few documents drew
   attention to evaluation. It is reassuring to see that there has been an
   emphasis placed on public involvement in the area of health and
   genomics. The findings underscore the gaps existing in the actual policy
   documents/guidelines and the need to clarify the goals, the methods, who
   is the public, what mechanism are appropriate and the need for
   evaluation when addressing public involvement in health genomics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a method to simultaneously restore and to
   segment piecewise homogeneous images degraded by a known point spread
   function (PSF) and additive noise. For this purpose, we propose a family
   of nonhomogeneous Gauss-Markov fields with Potts region labels model for
   images to be used in a Bayesian estimation framework. The joint
   posterior law of all the unknowns (the unknown image, its segmentation
   (hidden variable) and all the hyperparameters) is approximated by a
   separable probability law via the variational Bayes technique. This
   approximation gives the possibility to obtain practically implemented
   joint restoration and segmentation algorithm. We will present some
   preliminary results and comparison with a MCMC Gibbs sampling based
   algorithm. We may note that the prior models proposed in this work are
   particularly appropriate for the images of the scenes or objects that
   are composed of a finite set of homogeneous materials. This is the case
   of many images obtained in nondestructive testing (NDT) applications.}},

   The use of BFSK modulation allows the receiver to operate at higher data

   the more traditional OOK modulation. A fast calibration scheme and the
   absence of an external inductor make it ideal for ultralow-power sensor
   networks. A power consumption of 215 mu W from a 0.65-V supply and an
   area of 0.55 mm(2) make it ideal for highly integrated energy harvesting
   sensor nodes. At 2 Mb/s, the receiver consumes 0.18 nJ/b, making it the

Abstract = {{Objective. To test the hypothesis that interventions targeting the
   relief of pain and disability in musculoskeletal diseases may have
   differential effects on activity limitation and participation
   restriction as defined in the International Classification of
   Functioning. Disability and Health (ICE).
   Methods. Full data were obtained for 3 randomized controlled trials that
   used the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
   Measure (WOMAC), the Medical Outcomes Study Short-form 36 (SF-36), or
   the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire as their primary outcome measures.
   The trial outcomes were reanalyzed using items previously designated as
   assessing pure activity limitation (A) or participation restriction (P),
   or a mixture of the 2 (A/P) only, and the results compared with the
   outcomes found using the full scales, which assess a mixture of outcome
   domains.
   Results. The results did not refute the hypothesis. An exercise-based
   intervention and injection therapies both appeared to have more effect
   on participation restriction (P) than on activity limitation (A), while
   a drug-based intervention had more effect on A than on P.
   Conclusion. Different interventions used to treat musculoskeletal
   disorders may have differential effects on impairment, activity
   limitation, and restricted participation. The use of outcome measures
   that do not differentiate these 3 domains may obscure the true value of
   an intervention. (First Release July 1 2010; J Rheumatol

Abstract = {{Sinuous deep-water channels are recognized in most large deep-sea fans
   in the world. They present a particular interest to oil companies, since
   they are significant hydrocarbon reservoirs in deep offshore
   environments. The understanding of their geometries and their internal
   sedimentary architecture is necessary to better characterize reservoir
   heterogeneity of sinuous submarine channels.
   Therefore, numerous studies have been undertaken recently to better
   understand the behavior and sedimentary architecture of deep-water
   channels. The aim of this paper is to present our results concerning the
   development of the meandering channel of the present Congo turbidite
   system (or Zaire turbidite system). The study is based on
   high-resolution data including multibeam bathymetry, seismic lines,
   echosounder profiles, high-resolution side-scan sonar images, and
   gravity cores, collected by IFREMER along the submarine Congo channel
   between 1994 and 2000, during Guiness and ZaiAngo surveys.
   The present Congo turbidite channel is a long incised turbidite channel.
   It is presently active. It has been built gradually by progradation of
   the distal depositional area. The most distal part of the channel is the
   youngest part and shows an immature morphology: the channel presents a
   low incision and a low sinuosity. In contrast, the upper part of the
   channel has undergone a long evolutionary history. Its pathway is mature
   and complex, with numerous abandoned meanders visible in the morphology.
   This paper presents evidence of progressive channel migration and
   meander development of the Congo channel. It describes and explains the
   presence of terraces inside the channel. The detailed characterization
   of channel morphology and migration geometry shows that the evolution of
   the channel path is very similar to fluvial meandering systems with (1)
   lateral meander extension or growing, (2) downstream translation of the
   thalweg, and (3) meander cutoff.
   Seismic and 3.5 kHz echosounder profiles show that the terraces, which
   are visible in the seafloor morphology, are not the imprints of
   incisional processes. Terraces are true depositional units infilling the
   channel. They are built during and after the lateral migration of the
   channel. They are composed of (1) point-bar deposits and (2) inner-levee
   deposits aggrading above the point bar deposits. Point-bar deposits are
   characterized by low-angle oblique reflectors forming deposits with a
   sigmoidal shape. They seem very similar to those observed in fluvial
   systems. The similarity between fluvial and turbidite point bars
   suggests that the basal part of the turbidity currents flowing in this
   channel can be considered as very similar to river flow.
   With the high-resolution dataset collected in a present Congo turbidite
   channel, we provide a new description of the channel morphology and
   evolution, at a ``reservoir{''} scale, intermediate between outcrop
   observations and 2D and 3D seismic data. The detailed interpretation of
   intrachannel sedimentation, associated with lateral channel migration,
   also provides new data for interpretation of flow dynamics in submarine
   meandering channels.}},

Abstract = {{Although Germany does not figure among the `forerunners' of managerial
   reforms of the public sector, it has a long tradition of agencies and
   non-departmental bodies at the federal level. Over time, the federal
   administration has developed into a highly differentiated
   `administrative zoo' with a large number of species, questioning the
   image of a well-ordered German bureaucracy. The article addresses
   organizational changes among non-ministerial agencies during the past 20
   years and ministry-agency relations, drawing on data from a
   comprehensive survey of the federal administration. The structural
   changes we observe are neither comprehensive nor planned; they are much
   more evolutionary than revolutionary, driven by sectoral policies and
   not by any overall agency policy, supported more by regulatory than by
   managerial reforms, and most of the changes are horizontal mergers or
   successions of existing organizations, while we find almost no evidence
   for hiving-off from ministries to agencies. At the same time, federal
   agencies report a lot of bureaucratic discretion, whereas they perceive
   substantial levels of `red tape' due to administrative regulations. We
   also find that traditional, hierarchical modes of ministerial oversight
   are still dominating; only few agencies have performance agreements with

Abstract = {{This survey investigated the current practices and challenges of
   physicians treating opioid dependence in Germany, France, Italy and the
   UK. Doses favoured in Europe appeared to conflict with recommended best
   practice, with low mean methadone and buprenorphine maintenance closes
   reported (44.3 and 9.5 mg, respectively). Mean time to buprenorphine
   maintenance doses was longer than recommended at 14.4 days. Respondents
   also rated diversion and misuse management as their most difficult
   challenge in treating opioid dependence. These data suggest that
   prescribing practices are likely to increase this problem, as well as
   impeding treatment success by decreasing compliance and retention.}},

   sham-operated and control groups were stable until late filling phase
   and then increased slightly, whereas the renal pelvic pressure in the
   VUR group steadily increased from mid filling phase. Focal thinning of
   the tubular epithelium and interstitial widening were observed in
   certain cortical areas of refluxing kidneys, without inflammatory cell
   infiltration. Obvious changes in the mean diameters of distal tubules
   and extracellular matrix volume fractions were observed in two highly

Title = {{Phenomenological study of irregular cellular automata based on Lyapunov
   exponents and Jacobians}},
Journal = {{CHAOS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Originally, cellular automata (CA) have been defined upon regular
   tessellations of the n-dimensional Euclidean space, while CA on
   irregular tessellations have received only little attention from the
   scientific community, notwithstanding serious shortcomings are
   associated with the former manner of subdividing R-n. In this paper we
   present a profound phenomenological study of two-state, two-dimensional
   irregular CA from a dynamical systems viewpoint. We opted to exploit
   properly defined quantitative measures instead of resorting to
   qualitative methods for discriminating between behavioral classes. As
   such, we employ Lyapunov exponents, measuring the divergence rate of
   close trajectories in phase space, and Jacobians, formulated using
   Boolean derivatives and expressing the sensitivity of a cellular
   automaton to its inputs. Both are stated for two-state CA on irregular
   tessellations, enabling us to characterize these discrete dynamical
   systems, and advancing us to propose a classification scheme for this CA
   family. In addition, a relationship between these quantitative measures
   is established in extension of the insights already developed for the
   classical CA paradigm. Finally, we discuss the repercussions on the CA
   dynamics that arise when the geometric variability of the spatial
   entities is taken into account during the CA simulation. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{Research in psycholinguistics and in the cognitive neuroscience of
   language has suggested that semantic and syntactic processing are
   associated with different neurophysiologic correlates, such as the N400
   and the P600 in the ERPs. However, only a handful of studies have
   investigated the neural basis of the syntax-semantics interface, and
   even fewer experiments have dealt with the cases in which semantic
   composition can proceed independently of the syntax. Here we looked into
   one such case-complement coercion-using ERPs. We compared sentences such
   as, ``The journalist wrote the article{''} with ``The journalist began
   the article.{''} The second sentence seems to involve a silent semantic
   element, which is expressed in the first sentence by the head of the
   verb phrase (VP) ``wrote the article.{''} The second type of
   construction may therefore require the reader to infer or recover from
   memory a richer event sense of the VP ``began the article,{''} such as
   began writing the article, and to integrate that into a semantic
   representation of the sentence. This operation is referred to as
   ``complement coercion.{''} Consistently with earlier reading time, eye
   tracking, and MEG studies, we found traces of such additional
   computations in the ERPs: Coercion gives rise to a long-lasting negative
   shift, which differs at least in duration from a standard N400 effect.
   Issues regarding the nature of the computation involved are discussed in
   the light of a neurocognitive model of language processing and a formal
   semantic analysis of coercion.}},

Abstract = {{We model the distribution of neutral hydrogen (H i) in the
   post-reionization universe. This model uses gravity-only N-body
   simulations and an ansatz to assign H i to dark matter haloes that is
   consistent with observational constraints and theoretical models. We
   resolve the smallest haloes that are likely to host H i in the
   simulations; care is also taken to ensure that any errors due to the
   finite size of the simulation box are small. We then compute the
   smoothed one-point probability distribution function and the power
   spectrum of fluctuations in H i. This is compared with other predictions
   that have been made using different techniques. We highlight the
   significantly high bias for the H i distribution at small scales. This
   aspect has not been discussed before. We then discuss the prospects of
   the detection with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), Giant Meterwave
   Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the hypothetical MWA5000. The MWA5000 can
   detect visibility correlations at large angular scales at all redshifts
   in the post-reionization era. The GMRT can detect visibility
   correlations at lower redshifts; specifically there is a strong case for
   a survey at z similar or equal to 1.3. We also discuss prospects for
   direct detection of rare peaks in the H i distribution using the GMRT.
   We show that direct detection should be possible with an integration
   time that is comparable to, or even less than, the time required for a
   statistical detection. Specifically, it is possible to make a
   statistical detection of the H i distribution by measuring the
   visibility correlation and direct detection of rare peaks in the H i
   distribution at z similar or equal to 1.3 with the GMRT in less than
   1000 h of observations.}},

Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{For the singular, non-Hermitian, and positive semidefinite systems of
   linear equations, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for
   guaranteeing the semi-convergence of the Hermitian and skew-Hermitian
   splitting (HSS) iteration methods. We then investigate the
   semi-convergence factor and estimate its upper bound for the HSS
   iteration method. If the semi-convergence condition is satisfied, it is
   shown that the semi-convergence rate is the same as that of the HSS
   iteration method applied to a linear system with the coefficient matrix
   equal to the compression of the original matrix on the range space of
   its Hermitian part, that is, the matrix obtained from the original
   matrix by restricting the domain and projecting the range space to the
   range space of the Hermitian part. In particular, an upper bound is
   obtained in terms of the largest and the smallest nonzero eigenvalues of
   the Hermitian part of the coefficient matrix. In addition, applications

Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We propose that string theory in the background of quantized dyon black
   holes in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime is holographic dual
   to composite Dirac fermion metal. By utilizing S-duality map, we show
   that thermodynamic and transport properties of the black hole match with
   those of composite fermion metal, exhibiting Fermi liquid-like behavior.
   Built upon Dirac-Schwinger-Zwanziger quantization condition, we propose
   that turning on magnetic charges to electric black hole along the orbit
   of 0(2) subgroup of SL(2, Z) is equivalent to attaching even unit of
   statistical flux quanta to constituent fermions. Being at metallic
   point, the statistical magnetic flux is interlocked to the background
   magnetic field. We find supporting evidences for proposed holographic
   duality from study of internal energy of black hole and probe bulk
   fermion motion in black hole background. They show good agreement with
   ground-state energy of composite fermion metal in Thomas-Fermi
   approximation and cyclotron motion of constituent or composite fermion
   excitations near the Fermi-point.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. HESS J1632-478 is an extended and still unidentified TeV source in
   the galactic plane.
   Methods. In order to identify the source of the very high energy
   emission and to constrain its spectral energy distribution, we used a
   deep observation of the field obtained with XMM-Newton together with
   data from Molonglo, Spitzer and Fermi to detect counterparts at other
   wavelengths.
   Results. The flux density emitted by HESS J1632-478 peaks at very high
   energies and is more than 20 times weaker at all other wavelengths
   probed. The source spectrum features two large prominent bumps with the
   synchrotron emission peaking in the ultraviolet and the external inverse
   Compton emission peaking in the TeV. HESS J1632-478 is an energetic
   pulsar wind nebula with an age of the order of 104 years. Its bolometric
   (mostly GeV-TeV) luminosity reaches 10\% of the current pulsar spin down
   power. The synchrotron nebula has a size of 1 pc and contains an
   unresolved point-like X-ray source, probably the pulsar with its wind
   termination shock.}},

Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{Fear conditioning is accepted as a useful experimental paradigm to
   investigate anxious disorders following stress. In this field it is
   important to understand the mechanisms underlying the extinction of
   conditioned fear. In the rat it has been shown that the amygdalar
   basolateral nucleus plays a crucial role in all memorization phases of
   this type of memory (acquisition, consolidation, retrieval, and also
   reconsolidation and extinction). Recent results show that both the
   substantia nigra and nucleus basalis magnocellularis, two sites strongly
   connected with the basolateral amygdala are also involved in the
   consolidation of contextual fear conditioning.
   The aim of the present work is to investigate if latter two sites,
   besides the basolateral amygdala, are also involved in the extinction of
   the conditioned fear response. The results show that
   tetrodotoxin-induced inactivation of post-extinction training of either
   site does not impair the extinction process, which instead is impaired
   by inactivation of the basolateral amygdala. Thus, the present results
   confirm previous ones which show that diverse memorization phases
   (post-acquisition consolidation, extinction, reconsolidation) may be
   sustained by different neural sites and circuits. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{In this work, the applicability of a procedure based on the load
   separation criterion in determining the fracture resistance (J (Ic)) of
   a rubber modified polyamide 66 (PA66) was analyzed and discussed. In
   particular, the effects of the testing conditions, with particular
   reference to geometry and loading rate, on the applicability of the
   method were investigated. The tests were performed both at low (from 0.5
   to 50 mm/min) and moderately high (0.6 m/s) loading rates, on single
   edge notched in bending specimens with different initial crack length to
   width ratios (a (0)/W), which ranged between 0.3 and 0.7. Among the
   various findings it is worthwhile to point out that this analysis
   revealed that the plastic displacement at the end of the blunting
   process (at fracture initiation) resulted geometry independent. A clear
   dependence of such a parameter on the loading rate was observed.
   Further, it was shown that load separation is maintained beyond the
   blunting phase, as observed in the experiments carried out at low rate.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally the protection of intellectual property is regarded as a
   precondition for value capture. The rise of open source (OS) software
   and OS tangible products, so-called open design, has challenged this
   understanding. Openness is often regarded as a dichotomous variable
   (open-source vs. closed-source) and it is assumed that online developer
   communities demand full opening of the product's source. In this paper
   we will explore openness as a gradual and multi-dimensional concept. We
   carried out an Internet survey (N = 270) among participants of 20 open
   design communities in the domain of IT hardware and consumer
   electronics. We find that open design projects pursue complex strategies
   short of complete openness and that communities value openness of
   software more highly than openness of hardware. Our findings suggest
   that open design companies can successfully implement strategies of
   partial openness to safeguard value capture without alienating their
   developer community.}},

Title = {{Indicating Soil Acidity Using Vegetation Releves in Spatially Limited

Abstract = {{A fine-scaled approach for predicting soil acidity using plant species
   in a spatially limited area (epA(0)ky Nature Reserve, Slovakia) is
   presented here. This approach copes with some specific limitations: i) a
   limited pool of vegetation data may make the predictions too sensitive
   to the lack of species information, and ii) the predictions may be
   sensitive to the narrow pH gradient. Vegetation relev,s and soil
   reaction (pH-H2O and pH-CaCl2) were systematically recorded. A set of
   species indicator values and amplitudes was calibrated with physical pH
   data using the Weighted Averaging (WA), HOF modelling and Non-Metric
   Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) methods, along with Ellenberg indicator
   values. Two prediction methods were tested: i) WA and ii) Amplitude
   Overlap (AO). WA prediction with Ellenberg's and WA-calibrated species
   indicator values were the most powerful technique (R (2) = 68.4-68.7\%
   and 53.4-59.1\% for pH-CaCl2 and pH-H2O, respectively). WA-prediction
   with HOF-based indicator values was less effective (R (2) = 61.7\% and
   50.7\%) due to the decrease in species' information because with HOF
   modelling many species are assumed indifferent or too rare. The NMDS
   method does not bring any significant gain to the calibration, though it
   avoids the lack of species information. The AO method was proven to be
   less powerful under studied circumstances, because it is sensitive both
   to the lack of species' information and to the truncation of species
   responses. The results prove that a spatially explicit approach can
   provide significant indices to estimate changes in soil acidity -
   pH-CaCl2 better than pH-H2O.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new in situ hybridisation (ISH) protocol has been
   developed to identify African swine fever virus (ASFV) genome in
   formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Different digoxigenin
   labelled ASFV-probes were tested, including single ASFV-specific
   oligonucleotides, an 18.5 kb restriction fragment from the viral genome
   and the entire ASFV genome. The latter showed the highest sensitivity in
   all tissues tested, independently of the virus used for challenge: E75L
   or Ba71L Although a similar ASFV genome distribution was observed, the
   number of ISH-positive cells was higher for Ba71L compared to E75L
   infected tissues. As expected, the monocyte-macrophage cell lineage was
   the main target cell for ASFV infection. Corresponding with the last
   stages of infection, ISH-positive signals were also found in other cell
   types, including endothelial cells, hepatocytes and neutrophils.
   Furthermore, two unexpected findings were also noticed: the detection of
   a specific ISH-signal in lymphocytes and a tendency to find the signal
   in the nucleus of infected cells. In summary, the present findings
   demonstrate the utility of this new ISH protocol to study ASFV
   pathogenesis and its potential use as a diagnostic tool. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Four biodegradability tests (Pseudomonas putida bioassay, Zahn-Wellens

   the biodegradability enhancement during the treatment of wastewater
   containing 200 mg L-1 of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of a five
   commercial pesticides mixture (Vydate, Metomur, Couraze, Ditumur and
   Scala) by an advanced oxidation process (AOP). A comparative study was
   carried out taking into account repeatability and precision of each
   biodegradability test. Solar photo-Fenton was the AOP selected for
   pesticide degradation up to three levels of mineralization: 20\%, 40\%
   and 60\% of initial DOC. Intra- and interday precisions were evaluated
   conducting each biodegradability test by triplicate and they were
   applied three times on different dates over a period of three months.
   Fisher's least significant difference method was applied to the means,
   P. putida and Zahn-Wellens tests giving higher repeatability and
   precision. The P. putida test requires a shorter time to obtain reliable
   results using a standardized inoculum and constitutes a worthwhile
   alternative to estimate biodegradability in contrast to other less
   accurate or more time consuming methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

   in a survey of 496 employed adults across different organizations. We
   found LMX is predictive of affective and cognitive reactions to
   succession events, and that these reactions mediate the relationship

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In Tunisia the cuttlefish-processing industry generates
   large amounts of solid wastes. These wastes, which may represent 35\% of
   the original material and constitute an important source of proteins,
   are discarded without any attempt at recovery. This paper describes some
   functional properties and the angiotensin l-converting enzyme
   (ACE)-inhibitory activity of protein hydrolysates prepared by hydrolysis
   of cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) by-products with crude enzyme extract
   from Bacillus licheniformis NH1.
   RESULTS: Cuttlefish by-product protein hydrolysates (CPHs) with
   different degrees of hydrolysis (DH 5, 10 and 13.5\%) were prepared. All
   CPHs contained 750-790 g kg(-1) proteins. Solubility, emulsifying
   capacity and water-holding capacity increased while fat absorption and
   foaming capacity decreased with increasing DH. All hydrolysates showed
   greater fat absorption than the water-soluble fraction from undigested
   cuttlefish by-product proteins and casein. CPHs were also analysed for
   their ACE-inhibitory activity. CPH3 (DH 13.5\%) displayed the highest
   ACE inhibition (79\%), with an IC50 value of 1 mg mL(-1).
   CONCLUSION: Hydrolysis of cuttlefish by-product proteins with alkaline
   proteases from B. licheniformis resulted in a product with excellent
   solubility over a wide pH range and high ACE-inhibitory activity. This
   study suggests that CPHs could be utilised to develop functional foods
   for prevention of hypertension. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Polyaniline (PATIO nanofibers doped with camphor sulfonic acid have been
   irradiated with 90 MeV 07' ions at different fluences (3 x 10(10)-1 x
   10(12) ions/cm(2)) using a 15UD Pelletron accelerator under ultrahigh
   vacuum. XRD studies reveal a decrease in the domain length and an
   increase in the strain upon SHI irradiation The increase in d-spacing
   corresponding to the (1 0 0) reflection of PAni nanofibers with
   increasing irradiation fluence has been attributed to the increase in
   the tilt angle of the chains with respect to the (a, b) basal plane of
   PAni. Decrease in the integral intensity upon SHI irradiation indicates
   amorphization of the material Micro-Raman (uR) studies confirm
   amorphization of the PAni nanofibers and also show that the PArn
   nanofibers get de-doped upon SHI irradiation IA spectroscopy also
   reveals a benzenoid to quinoid transition in the PAni chain upon SHI
   irradiation TEM results show that the size of PAni nanofibers decreases
   with the increase in irradiation fluence, which has been attributed to
   the fragmentation of PAni nanofibers in the core of amorphized tracks

Abstract = {{Although the higher incidence of stress-related psychiatric disorders in
   females is well documented, its basis is unknown. Here, we show that the
   receptor for corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), the neuropeptide that
   orchestrates the stress response, signals and is trafficked differently
   in female rats in a manner that could result in a greater response and
   decreased adaptation to stressors. Most cellular responses to CRF in the
   brain are mediated by CRF receptor (CRFr) association with the
   GTP-binding protein, G(s). Receptor immunoprecipitation studies revealed
   enhanced CRFr-G(s) coupling in cortical tissue of unstressed female
   rats. Previous stressor exposure abolished this sex difference by
   increasing CRFr-G(s) coupling selectively in males. These molecular
   results mirrored the effects of sex and stress on sensitivity of locus
   ceruleus (LC)-norepinephrine neurons to CRF. Differences in CRFr
   trafficking were also identified that could compromise stress adaptation
   in females. Specifically, stress-induced CRFr association with
   beta-arrestin2, an integral step in receptor internalization, occurred
   only in male rats. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that stress
   elicited CRFr internalization in LC neurons of male rats exclusively,
   consistent with reported electrophysiological evidence for
   stress-induced desensitization to CRF in males. Together, these studies
   identified two aspects of CRFr function, increased cellular signaling
   and compromised internalization, which render CRF-receptive neurons of
   females more sensitive to low levels of CRF and less adaptable to high
   levels of CRF. CRFr dysfunction in females may underlie their increased
   vulnerability to develop stress-related pathology, particularly that
   related to increased activity of the LC-norepinephrine system, such as
   depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. Molecular Psychiatry

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of the lubrication problem in
   hydrodynamic bearings with alternate rotational motion. In contrast to
   conventional bearings, the shaft does not perform a complete revolution
   but inverts the direction of its rotation instead. The analysis follows
   the basic assumption of the Reynolds lubrication theory i.e. fluid
   inertia is neglected in the gap formed by the eccentric shaft with
   respect to the bearing. The differential equations of mass and momentum
   in the oil gap are integrated to give the velocity field, pressure
   distribution and hydrodynamic forces under simplified assumptions. To
   evaluate the model under known operational conditions a rotor dynamics
   approach is used. This allows evaluation of the lubrication conditions
   for this type of bearing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient bacterial synthesis method to harvest cadmium telluride
   (CdTe) quantum dots (QDs) with tunable fluorescence emission using
   Escherichia coli is demonstrated. Ultraviolet-visible,
   photoluminescence, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron
   microscopy analysis confirmed the superior size-tunable optical
   properties, with fluorescence emission from 488 to 551 nm, and the good
   crystallinity of the as synthesized QDs. A surface protein capping layer
   was confirmed by hydrodynamic size, potential and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy measurements, which could maintain the viability
   (92.9\%) of cells in an environment with a QD concentration as high as 2
   mu M. After functionalization with folic acid the QDs were used to image
   cultured cervical cancer cells in vitro. Investigations of bacterial
   growth and morphology and the biosynthesis of CdTe QDs in Luria-Bertani
   medium containing E. coli-secreted proteins showed that extracellular
   synthesis directly relied on the E. coli-secreted proteins, and a
   mechanism for protein-assisted biosynthesis of QDs is proposed. This
   work provides an economical approach to fabricate highly fluorescent
   biocompatible CdTe QDs via an environmentally friendly production
   process. The biosynthesized QDs may have great potential in broad

   Archipelago, Brazil. Censuses of the Brown Bobby population at St. Peter
   and St. Paul Archipelago (00 degrees 55' 10{''}N, 29 degrees 20'
   33{''}W) were made during six research expeditions between September of
   2001 and July of 2002 through counts of the birds present on the ground
   and on man-made structures. Bird numbers varied with the time of the
   day, with a maximum at 05h30 (381) and minimum at 13h30 (265). There
   were no significant variations in the population size between seasons of
   the year and between years. The final estimates of the population, of
   all life stages combined, were of 377 birds in 2001 and of 381 birds in
   2002. Among the adults the abundance of females was higher than the
   males at all times, with average sex ratio of 1.3 females/males. The age
   structure, with an average 81\% of adults, did not changed throughout
   the year. Of the total population number, 88\% occurred at Belmonte
   Islet, where 13\% had settled on man-made structures. The population
   densities ranged from 0.003 to 0.402 birds/m(2), with highest value in
   Belmonte breeding colony. The mean density in the study area was 0,022
   birds/m(2). The results are discussed here in relation with factors
   affecting the population and may support actions for its conservation

Abstract = {{We report here the first documented case of a cetacean fatality from
   entanglement in recreational Spectra (R) fishing twine. Spectra (R)
   twine is a relatively new microfilament braided twine that is marketed
   to replace nylon monofilament twine in rod and reel fisheries. Following
   the case of this entangled bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), we
   conducted tests with Spectra (R) and comparable monofilament twines on
   Tursiops tissue from stranded animals to compare the abrasion properties
   of the twines. We found that Spectra (R) twine was significantly more
   abrasive on bottlenose dolphin fluke tissue than a similar strength and
   diameter monofilament. With the same forces applied, the Spectra (R)
   twine cut deeper than the monofilament, exhibiting a linear relationship
   with force applied where the monofilament appeared to reach a maximum
   depth of penetration of approximately 2 mm. These tests may explain why
   this bottlenose dolphin was so severely debilitated from carrying a
   relatively light load of twine over a short period of time (20 days).
   Future public and corporate outreach will be essential to minimize the
   effect that this increasingly popular fishing twine will have on
   non-target species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of steroid therapy on
   serum cystatin C (cysC) concentrations in patients with acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and idiopthias thrombocytopenias purpura
   (ITP). We studied 17 patients with ITP (girls: boys=5:12, mean age: 7.6
   yrs, range between 1 to 17 years) and 18 patients with ALL (girls:
   boys=6:12, mean age: 6.3 yrs, range between 2 to 17 years). CysC and
   white blood cell count (WBC) in both group of patients were determined
   before and after 300 mg/m(2) cumulative dose of steroid therapy.
   Corticosteroids increased the level of cysC in both groups of patients,
   however significant increase was found only in ITP patients between pre-
   and posttreatment values (0,96 +/- 0,27 mg/L vs. 1,16 +/- 0,3 mg/L,
   p=0,02). Pretreatment cysC concentrations were within the reference
   range in patients with ITP but not with ALL and were significantly
   higher in ALL patients, than in ITP patients (1,23 +/- 1,12 mg/L vs.
   0,96 +/- 0,27 mg/L, p=0,02). Pretreatment WBC of ALL patients were
   significantly higher than of ITP patients (22,58 G/L, min. 3,5 G/L, max.
   102,1 G/L vs. 7,46 G/L, min. 4,8 G/L, max. 12,3 G/L, p=0.03). We have
   found significant correlation between pretreatment cysC and WBC values
   in ALL patients (p=0.04). Although the concentration of cysC may be
   slightly and reversibly influenced by corticosteroid treatment, cysC is
   sensitive to detect early and moderate deteoriantation of GFR in

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The proportion of women who are of childbearing age or pregnant seems to
   be increasing, probably due to delayed age at first pregnancy. Both
   clinical situations require special attention and participation of a
   multidisciplinary team. Breast cancer during pregnancy calls for strict
   monitoring of the mother and fetus. Selection of diagnostic methods,
   treatment and follow-up assessments should involve minimal risk to the
   fetus. Therefore, some diagnostic methods, such as magnetic resonance,
   and several treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy during the
   first trimester, must be avoided unless their use is strictly necessary.
   Therapeutic abortion is rarely indicated, except in women with
   metastatic disease or when chemotherapy administration is not possible.
   After breast cancer, it is prudent to defer pregnancy until two years
   after completion of therapy due to the high risk of recurrence in this
   period. One of the major adverse events of cancer therapy is
   chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure and amenorrhea. Most
   chemotherapeutics increase the risk of early menopause and loss of
   fertility. Therefore, in young women the use of agents with the least
   impact on ovarian function must be considered. In addition, prior to
   treatment physicians should inform their patients about their
   reproductive future and available options to preserve fertility.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN HIV AND AIDS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{386-390}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vectors have emerged as promising vaccine
   platform technologies due to their capacity to elicit potent humoral and
   cellular immune responses to encoded antigens. These vectors are being
   explored as potential vaccine candidates for a variety of pathogens.
   This review summarizes current efforts to develop rAd vector-based
   vaccines for HIV-1.
   Recent findings
   In the phase 2b Step study, rAd5 vectors expressing clade B HIV-1 Gag,
   Pol, and Nef antigens failed to afford protection and may have resulted
   in increased HIV-1 acquisition in certain subgroups. Recent studies have
   explored the potential reasons for this failure and the utility of novel
   rAd vectors derived from non-Ad5 serotypes.
   Summary
   Current areas of active investigation include the development of
   alternative serotype rAd vectors, the incorporation of rAd vectors into
   heterologous vector prime-boost regimens, and the use of rAd vectors to
   express novel HIV-1 antigens. These HIV-1 vaccine candidates will be
   evaluated in clinical trials over the next several years.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the market for skyscrapers in Manhattan from
   1895 to 2004. Clark and Kingston (1930) have argued that extreme height
   is a result of profit maximization, while Helsley and Strange (2008)
   posit that skyscraper height can be caused, in part, by strategic
   interaction among builders. I provide a model for the market for
   building height and the number of completions, which are functions of
   the market fundamentals and the desire of builders to stand out in the
   skyline. I test this model using time series data. I find that
   skyscraper completions and average heights over the 20th century are
   consistent with profit maximization; the desire to add extra height to
   stand out does not appear to be a systematic determinant of building
   height.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease,
   characterized by episodic and reversible airflow obstruction and airway
   hyperresponsiveness and is influenced by both genetic and environmental
   factors. Methods. The Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) survey
   was used to determine the prevalence of self-reported asthma in a target
   population of 325,000 adults aged >= 40 in Southeastern Kentucky.
   Postbronchodilator spirometry was used to classify subjects based on
   lung function. Risk factors for asthma in this population, in particular
   indoor usage of biomass fuels, were evaluated. Results. The overall
   study population was comprised of 508 individuals, with 15.5\% reporting
   current asthma and 5.8\% reporting former asthma. In this population,
   the following risk factors for asthma were identified: female sex,
   smoking, less than a high school education, increasing body mass index
   (BMI), and a history of cooking indoors with coal and wood. Cooking
   indoors with wood and coal for more than 6 months of one's life was
   shown to significantly increase the odds of reporting current asthma
   (odds ratio (OR) = 2.3, confidence interval (CI) 1.1, 5.0), whereas no
   effect was seen from a history of heating indoors with wood and coal (OR
   = 0.8, CI 0.4, 1.8). Conclusions. Current or former asthma was reported
   by 21.3\% of the adult population. A history of using biomass fuels when
   cooking indoors significantly increased the risk of reporting current
   asthma in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their remarkable transparency in the mid to far-infrared region,
   telluride films are considered for the fabrication of micro-components
   for infrared applications. In the framework of the Darwin mission
   initiated by the European Space Agency, amorphous TexGe100-x (with x
   comprised between 73.1 and 88.5 at.\%) thick films were deposited by
   co-thermal evaporation from tellurium and germanium elemental powders.
   Homogeneous films with thickness comprised between 6 and 15 mu m were
   obtained. Specimens deposited on microscope slide substrates were used
   for composition, structure, thermal properties, transmission and
   Vicker's microhardness measurements. Films deposited on commercial
   As2Se3 bulk glass substrates were used for refractive index measurements
   by the M-lines method. The different measurements revealed that the
   replacement of Ge by Te in the TexGe100-x films was responsible for a
   decrease in the glass transition temperature and in the stability of the
   glass against crystallization. Moreover a two-stage crystallization
   implying the presence of two crystallization peaks in the DSC curves was
   highlighted for x>80 at.\% Te. The increase in x was also shown to be
   responsible for a decrease in the Vicker's microhardness and an increase
   in the linear refractive index. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, a 2-D numerical model is investigated to predict and
   evaluate the performance of an anode-supported SOFC button cell. The
   flow field is calculated using 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Heat and mass
   transfer equations are solved to calculate species and temperature
   distribution in the cell body and in fuel and air channels. The
   electrical and electrochemical processes are simulated coupled with the
   heat and mass transfer model. A discretized network circuit is adopted
   to the cell geometry for considering the ohmic losses and joule heating
   of the current that passes through the cell body. The model predicts the
   cell output voltage, the local EMF and the state variables pressure,
   temperature and species concentrations. The local electrical parameters
   are calculated based on the local pressure, temperature and
   concentration of the species. The numerical results are compared with
   the experimental data and good agreement is observed. The simulation is
   carried out for different input fuel flow rates and humidification. The
   results show how the input fuel mass flow rate and humidification level
   affects the button cell SOFC performance. In addition, influences of the
   anode thickness on cell performance through the ohmic over potential are
   investigated. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by

Title = {{Therapeutic Efficacy of Icatibant in Angioedema Induced by

Abstract = {{Study objective: The pathophysiology of angiotensin-converting enzyme
   inhibitor (ACEi)-induced angioedema most likely resembles that of
   hereditary angioedema, le, it is mainly mediated by bradykinin-induced
   activation of vascular bradykinin B2 receptors. We hypothesize that the
   bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant might be an effective
   therapy for ACEi-induced angioedema.
   Methods: Eight patients with acute ACEi-induced angioedema were treated
   with a single subcutaneous injection of icatibant. The outcome was
   assessed by the time to first improvement of symptoms, complete symptom
   relief, and drug safety. In addition, we retrospectively assessed the
   clinical course of 47 consecutive patients of our clinic with
   ACEi-induced angioedema.
   Results: First symptom improvement after icatibant injection occurred at
   a mean time of 50.6 minutes (standard deviation {[}SD] 21 minutes) and
   complete relief of symptoms at 4.4 hours (SD 0.8 hours). No patient
   received tracheal intubation, other drug treatment, tracheotomy, or a
   second icatibant injection. There were no adverse effects except
   erythema occurring at the injection site. In the historical comparison
   group treated with methylprednisolone and clemastine, the mean time to
   complete relief of symptoms was 33 hours (SD 19.4 hours). Some of these
   patients received a tracheotomy (3/47), were intubated (2/47), or
   received a second dose of methylprednisolone (12/47).
   Conclusion: Although sample size limits the external validity of our
   results, the substantial decrease of time to complete symptom relief
   suggests that this new treatment is likely effective as a
   pharmacotherapeutic approach to treat ACEi-induced angioedema. {[}Ann

Abstract = {{Effect of scale on the hydrodynamics of gas-solid fluidized beds was
   investigated in two fluidized beds of 152 mm and 78 mm in diameter. Air
   at room temperature was used as the fluidizing gas in the bed of sand
   particles. The Radioactive Particle Tracking (RPT) technique was
   employed to obtain the instantaneous positions of the particles at every
   20 ms of the experiments. These data were used to calculate hydrodynamic
   parameters,. such as mean velocity of upward and downward-moving
   particles, jump frequency, cycle frequency and axial and radial
   diffusivities, which are representative of solid mixing and diffusion of
   particles in the bed These hydrodynamic parameters were compared in both
   scales in order to determine the scale effect on the hydrodynamics of
   the gas-solid fluidized bed In all cases, it was shown that solid mixing
   and diffusivity of particles increase by increasing column diameter. The
   results of this study would help to understand solid mixing which might
   be critical in industrial fluidized bed reactors.}},

Abstract = {{Vitoria Bay is a 20 km long estuary, morphologically narrow, with a
   microtidal regime and, as other modern estuaries, was formed during the
   last post-glacial transgression. The estuarine bed morphology is
   characterised by a main natural channel limited by tidal flats with
   developed mangroves. Original radiocarbon dates were obtained for the
   site. Five radiocarbon ages ranging from 1,010 to 7,240 years BP were
   obtained from two sedimentary cores, which represent a 5 m thick
   stratigraphic sequence. The results indicate that, until about 4,000
   cal. yrs BP, environmental conditions in Vitoria Bay were still of an
   open bay, with a free and wide connection with marine waters. During the
   last 4,000 yrs, the bay has experienced a major regression phase, by
   becoming more restricted in terms of seawater circulation and probably
   increasing tidal energy. Three main stratigraphic surfaces were
   recognised, which limit trangressive, trangressive/highstand and
   regressive facies. The present channel morphology represents a tidal
   scouring surface or a tidal diastem, which erodes and truncates
   regressive facies bedding. Foraminiferal biofacies, which change from
   marine to brackish and mangrove tidal-flat environments, support the
   seismic stratigraphic interpretation. Absence of mangrove biofacies at
   one of the two cores is also an indication of modern tidal ravinement.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the variability of workers' earnings in Canada over
   the period 1982-2006. We decompose the total variance of workers'
   earnings into a `permanent' component between workers and a `transitory'
   earnings instability component over time for given workers. We then
   investigate the statistical relationships between these components and
   indicators for the business cycle. The most marked change in earnings
   variances in Canada since 1982 is the general rise in total earnings
   variance, which is essentially driven by a quite dramatic rise in
   long-run earnings inequality. The patterns across age categories of the
   two variance components are almost opposite. Long-run earnings
   inequality generally rises with age, but earnings instability is seen to
   generally decline with age, so that earnings instability is markedly
   highest among entry age workers. Unemployment rate effects are positive
   on almost all variance measures, while higher unemployment is associated
   with widened long-run earnings differentials and greater short-run
   earnings instability.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a novel acute cardiac syndrome
   characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction of the
   left-ventricular apex and mid-ventricle, with hyperkinesis of the basal
   left ventricular segments, which has been associated with severe
   emotional or physical stress. Method: This is the second published case
   report of takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurring in the setting of
   electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Results: The patient, a 52-year-old
   woman, experienced chest pain and discomfort shortly after ECT
   treatment. She was shown to have moderate left-ventricular dysfunction,
   with mid-cavity left-ventricular hypo-to akinesis, and hyperkinesis in
   the basilar region, consistent with a diagnosis of takotsubo
   cardiomyopathy. There was full resolution of her symptoms within 48
   hours of the initial event. Discussion: This report highlights a
   previously undocumented complication of ECT and adds to the growing list
   of stressors responsible for cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The
   prognosis is favorable, and recovery is generally complete, especially
   with early recognition of the syndrome and proper supportive treatment.

   dessin,e books from the Tintin series, Herg,'s Destination Moon
   (Objectif Lune, 1953) and its sequel Explorers on the Moon (On a March,

   series for their graphic, narrative and philosophical emphasis on both
   intellectual achievement and physical death. The Moon, as a goal of
   modern science and a traditional artistic symbol, is made to celebrate
   the human mind. But Herg, also makes it a dangerous no man's land, where
   human beings are made to understand the limitations of their physical
   abilities. The Moon emphasises the distortion between human dreams of
   grandeur and the concrete impossibility of their realisation, and the
   threats they pose to corporeality. As a result, the article suggests
   that the Moon trip can be seen as a modern re-enactment of the
   mythological journey to Hell, as the works of the human mind are
   constantly thwarted by the risk of physical death.}},

Abstract = {{The theme of this special issue is the necessity of a cosmopolitan turn
   in social and political theory. The question at the heart of this
   introductory chapter takes the challenge of `methodological
   cosmopolitanism', already addressed in a Special Issue on Cosmopolitan
   Sociology in this journal (Beck and Sznaider 2006), an important step
   further: How can social and political theory be opened up, theoretically
   as well as methodologically and normatively, to a historically new,
   entangled Modernity which threatens its own foundations? How can it
   account for the fundamental fragility, the mutability of societal
   dynamics (of unintended side-effects, domination and power), shaped by
   the globalization of capital and risks at the beginning of the
   twenty-first century? What theoretical and methodological problems arise
   and how can they be addressed in empirical research? In the following,
   we will develop this `cosmopolitan turn' in four steps: firstly, we
   present the major conceptual tools for a theory of cosmopolitan
   modernities; secondly, we de-construct Western modernity by using
   examples taken from research on individualization and risk; thirdly, we
   address the key problem of methodological cosmopolitanism, namely the
   problem of defining the appropriate unit of analysis; and finally, we
   discuss normative questions, perspectives, and dilemmas of a theory of
   cosmopolitan modernities, in particular problems of political agency and
   prospects of political realization.}},

Abstract = {{A new topology for designing compact, band-pass filters of arbitrary
   order is proposed. The basic building block of hand-pass filters
   designed using this technique is a capacitively coupled second-order
   filter, which can be thought of as the unit cell of a higher order
   hand-pass filter. The second-order filter is composed of slow-wave
   transmission line resonators separated by an inductive admittance
   inverter. To easily control the bandwidth of the filter, the entire
   structure is capacitively coupled to the feeding transmission lines
   using series capacitors. This unit cell can be used in different
   cascading schemes to obtain filters of odd and even orders. Using this
   technique. hand-pass filters with fractional bandwidths in the range of
   1-20\% can easily be designed. Several different examples of such
   band-pass filters along with their measurement results are presented and
   discussed in this article. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave

Journal = {{PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{354-357}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: During the clerkship years, students often discover a
   misalignment between formal preclinical communication skills teaching
   and the actual practices of housestaff and attending role models. We
   developed a workshop for medical educators to identify how the hidden
   curriculum models (or fails to model) effective communication skills.
   Workshop design: Using Readers' Theater, participants enacted and then
   discussed a scenario designed to trigger reflection. The script was
   adapted from an in-depth student narrative describing her team's use of
   a derogatory term to label a patient. The student must decide whether
   and how to respond.
   Workshop outcomes: Participants discussed potential responses to
   breaches of professionalism medical hierarchy, ethical conflict centered
   on conforming pressure, ``holding ambivalence{''}, and gender inequality
   in medicine. A number of communication options for the student were
   considered, and role-played.
   Conclusion: The use of student narratives in medical education helps
   learners better understand the content and nuance of the hidden
   curriculum. Readers' Theater is a powerful tool to actively invite
   learners to step into the shoes of trainees in order to glean additional
   perspectives. Engaging educators in the task of collaborative solution
   building using this format can help improve learning environments. (C)

Abstract = {{The feasibility for the observation of a certain leptonic Kaluza-Klein
   (KK) hard process in pp interactions at the LHC is presented. Within the
   S-1/Z(2) TeV-1 extra dimensional theoretical framework with the focus on
   the KK excitations of the Standard Model gamma and Z(0) gauge bosons,
   the hard-process, f (f) over bar -> Sigma(n) (gamma{*}/Z{*})(n) -> F (F)
   over bar, has been used where f is the initial state parton, F the final
   state lepton and (gamma{*}/Z{*})(n) is the n(th) KK excitation of the
   gamma/Z(0) boson. For this study the analytic form for the hard process
   cross section has been independently calculated by the authors and has
   been implemented using the Moses framework. The Moses framework itself,
   that has been written by the authors, was used as an external process
   within the PYTHIA8 Monte Carlo generator which provides the phase space
   generation for the final state leptons and partons from the initial
   state hadrons, and the simulation of initial and final state radiation
   and hadronization. A brief discussion of the possibility for observing
   and identifying the unique signature of the KK signal given the current

Journal = {{PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{The plant plasma membrane barrier can express aquaporins (PIP1 and PIP2)
   that show two intriguing aspects: (1) the potential of modulating whole
   membrane water permeability by co-expression of both types, which have
   recently been distinguished for showing a different capacity to reach
   the plasma membrane; and (2) the faculty to reduce water permeation
   through the pore after cytosolic acidification, as a consequence of a
   gating process. Our working hypothesis is that these two key features
   might enhance plasticity of the membrane water transport capacity if
   they jointly trigger any cooperative interaction. In previous work, we
   proved by biophysical approaches that the plasma membrane of the
   halophyte Beta vulgaris storage root presents highly permeable
   aquaporins that can be shut down by acidic pH. Root Beta vulgaris PIPs
   were therefore subcloned and expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Co-expression
   of BvPIP1;1 and BvPIP2;2 not only enhances oocyte plasma membrane water
   permeability synergistically but also reinforces pH inhibitory response
   from partial to complete shut down after cytosolic pH acidification.
   This pH dependent behavior shows that PIP1-PIP2 co-expression accounts
   for a different pH sensitivity in comparison with PIP2 expression. These
   results prove for the first time that PIP co-expression modulates the
   membrane water permeability through a pH regulatory response, enhancing
   in this way membrane versatility to adjust its water transfer capacity.}},

Title = {{Observations on non-additive predation: birds and grasshoppers}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{739-749}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Classic predator prey theory assumes that predatory
   mortality is additive with other sources of mortality, but predatory
   mortality can be non-additive. If predators preferentially kill
   individuals already `doomed' from other mortality causes, then predation
   can be less than additive. If predators preferentially kill individuals
   more likely to survive, then predation can be greater than additive. In
   either case, to be non-additive, predation must modify other causes of
   mortality such as intraspecific competition, decreasing it in the former
   case and increasing it in the latter. Non-additive predation also can
   modify selective pressures of predation and is seldom considered except
   when prey are much larger than their predators.
   Question: Can non-additive predation be observed in the most common type
   of predator prey system (prey much smaller than their predators) where
   this is considered very unlikely?
   Organisms: Two sympatric grasshoppers and their avian predators.
   Field site: National Bison Range, Montana, USA.
   Methods: Field experiments to determine: (1) whether better foraging
   individuals survive longer in the absence of predators or if they die
   from non-predatory causes in the presence of predators; (2) whether
   predators preferentially kill better or poorer foragers; and (3) how
   predators affect prey populations.
   Conclusions: Both grasshoppers exhibit intraspecific competition with
   better foragers surviving longer. Both experience high predation rates,
   but their populations respond differently to predation. One increased
   with predation, due to the non-additive effect of the predators
   preferentially killing poor foragers, and thereby diminishing
   intraspecific competition, which counters predatory mortality. The other
   population declined more than expected with predation due to the
   non-additive effect of the predators preferentially killing good
   foragers, and thereby intensifying intraspecific competition.}},

Abstract = {{The dependence of the coercive field and saturated magnetization on the
   interfacial width is studied to understand the driving mechanism of the
   coercive enhancement in Fe/Mn and Co/Mn bilayers. We establish a

   Using a model, we reveal that the full interfacial width plays a

   examine the glass ceiling metaphor to determine whether it continues to
   be useful in contemporary social and economic contexts. We analyse the
   recently introduced firewall metaphor for its usefulness for
   constructing discriminatory processes in organizations, which remain
   hidden in the glass ceiling metaphor. Our analysis suggests that both
   metaphors are useful for constructing diverse aspects of discrimination.
   In the contemporary context, however, firewalls may have greater utility
   due to their complexity, fluidity, heterogeneity and possibilities for

Abstract = {{The pancreatic beta-cell ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K-ATP channel) plays
   a critical role in glucose homeostasis by linking glucose metabolism to
   electrical excitability and insulin secretion. Changes in the
   intracellular ratio of ATP/ADP mediate the metabolic regulation of
   channel activity. The beta-cell K-ATP channel is a hetero-octameric
   complex composed of two types of subunits: four inward-rectifying
   potassium channel pore-forming (Kir6.2) subunits and four high-affinity
   sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits. Kir6.2 and SUR1 are encoded by
   the genes KCNJ11 and ABCC8, respectively. Mutations in these genes can
   result in congenital hyperinsulinism and permanent neonatal diabetes.
   This review highlights the important role of the beta-cell K-ATP channel
   in glucose physiology and provides an introduction to some of the other

Abstract = {{Objectives: To ascertain the long-term safety, efficacy, and pattern of
   use of drug-eluting stents (DES) in routine clinical practice. Methods:
   We analyzed a registry of 6,583 consecutive patients undergoing
   percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), of whom 2,633 were treated
   using DES (DES group) and 3,950 were treated using bare-metal stents
   (BMS group). Propensity score was used for stratified analysis of
   outcomes and for matching. Outcomes were total mortality, myocardial
   infarction (MI), repeat target vessel revascularization (TVR) rates, and
   risk-adjusted event-free survival. Results: Follow-up time was 6 months
   to 5.18 years (mean: 3 years). Patients in the DES group were more
   likely to be diabetic and had use of longer or more stents, treatment of
   more lesions and of more proximal main vessels. After propensity score
   matching, the cumulative mortality was 12.85\% in the DES group versus
   14.14\% in the BMS group (P = 0.001). Use of DES reduced the occurrence
   of MI (5.17\%vs.5.83 A, P = 0.046), of clinically driven TVR (9.76\% vs.
   12.28\%, P < 0.001) and of the composite endpoint of death/MI/TVR
   (23.38\% vs. 26.07\%; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our risk-adjusted
   event-free survival analysis indicates a prognostic benefit for DES
   utilization that sustains up to 5 years following PCI. (C) 2010

   urban expansion of the central business district (CBD). Additional
   enhanced, high-reflectivity areas are found in southern Fulton and

   in a gel based on PEG-crosslinked serum albumin, supplemented with 4\%
   hyaluronan (HSA-HA). Each gel culture was compared to its parallel
   proliferating monolayer (PML) culture and non-proliferating high density
   monolayer culture (HDML). MSCs were chondrogenically induced in both
   standard micromass (MM) cultures and HSA-HA. Cell viability in HSA-HA
   was above 90\%. Chondrogenic differentiation was defined by changes in
   the expression of the mRNA for collagen types I, II, and X, for
   aggrecan, for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and for hyaluronan synthases-2
   and -3 (has-2, has-3). For disk cells and chondrocytes, the changes for
   collagen type II and aggrecan were in the range of up to 100-fold,
   depending on the human individual. After induction, MSCs differentiated
   equally well in MM and HSA-HA, showing increases spanning several orders
   of magnitude compared to uninduced monolayer (ML) cells. For has-2 and
   has-3, the changes were less obvious, but interestingly, the ratio of
   has-2/has-3 expression in HSA-HA cultures decreased approximately
   40-fold for disk cells, remained unchanged for chondrocytes, but
   increased sevenfold for MSCs, when compared to the corresponding ML
   cultures. Taken together, HSA-HA revealed its potential as an anchoring
   hydrogel for chondrogenic cell types.}},

Abstract = {{``Thin{''} modular polyethylene bearings have previously been associated
   with failure from wear. This study examined the influence of
   polyethylene thickness on survivorship in primary total knee
   arthroplasty (TKA). Do ``thinner{''} or ``thicker{''} bearings fail
   more? Six thousand seventy primary TKAs with a single implant design
   were reviewed. The failure rate in knees with bearings 14 mm or less was
   0.7\%, whereas the failure rate of knees with bearings 16 mm or greater
   was 2.3\% (P < .0001; hazard ratio, 3.2). No knee was revised for
   polyethylene wear. Thicker bearings did not directly cause failure, but
   factors that lead to the insertion of a thicker bearing such as a deeper
   tibial resection and ligament imbalance may contribute to the observed
   increased failure. The significant influence of this often-unrecognized
   surgical variable has not been previously reported and must be carefully
   considered during TKA.}},

Abstract = {{Although integrated care for adults in primary care has steadily
   increased over the last several decades, there remains a paucity of
   research regarding integrated care for children in primary care. To
   report results of a pilot study testing initial feasibility of a
   parenting psychoeducational group targeting child behavioral problems
   within a primary care clinic. The participants (n = 35) were parents
   representing an underserved population from an inner-city primary care
   clinic. Participants attended a 12-week psychoeducational parenting
   group and reported pre- and post-measures of family functioning, child
   misbehavior and dyadic functioning. Paired t-tests and effects sizes are
   reported. Participants reported statistically significant improvement in
   family functioning, child misbehavior, and couple functioning after
   participating in the parenting psychoeducational group. Results suggest
   initial feasibility of a parenting psychoeducational group within a
   primary care clinic with an underserved population. This intervention
   may be useful for other primary care clinics seeking to offer more
   integrative care options for children and their families.}},

Abstract = {{Can negative information about a product increase sales, and if so,
   when? Although popular wisdom suggests that ``any publicity is good
   publicity,{''} prior research has demonstrated only downsides to
   negative press. Negative reviews or word of mouth, for example, have
   been found to hurt product evaluation and sales. Using a combination of
   econometric analysis and experimental methods, we unify these
   perspectives to delineate contexts under which negative publicity about
   a product will have positive versus negative effects. Specifically, we
   argue that negative publicity can increase purchase likelihood and sales
   by increasing product awareness. Consequently, negative publicity should
   have differential effects on established versus unknown products. Three
   studies support this perspective. Whereas a negative review in the New
   York Times hurt sales of books by well-known authors, for example, it
   increased sales of books that had lower prior awareness. The studies
   further underscore the importance of a gap between publicity and
   purchase occasion and the mediating role of increased awareness in these
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study was performed in order to determine the value of
   tomographic evaluation in measurement of the internal nasal valve
   angle..
   Patients and Methods: Thirty-one patients were examined by nasal
   endoscopy and computerized tomography. In each case, nasal valve angle
   were measured using nasal endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) images.
   Computed tomography measurements obtained from classic coronal and nasal
   base view (NBV) sections to determine the nasal valve angle were
   compared with the measurements obtained from nasal endoscopic
   examination images.
   Results: When the endoscopic versus the coronal tomographic measurements
   and the coronal tomographic versus NBV images measurements were
   compared, statistically significant differences were found. No
   statistically significant difference was observed between the endoscopic
   and NBV images measurements.
   Conclusion: The results of the study indicate that tomographic images
   obtained through NBV technique provide accurate measurements of nasal
   valve angle. Thus, this technique may be choice of preference in the
   evaluation of nasal and paranasal areas in selected patients. However,
   traditional coronal tomographic imaging is not a proper method for
   determination of the nasal valve angle alone because of it's cost and
   side effects.}},

Abstract = {{Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) have been implicated as an

   sources. We illustrate some of the wide variety of morphological forms
   that these particles can assume and indicate obvious differences in the
   characteristics of TEP from different source waters. Visualization,
   together with measurement of TEP concentrations can serve as useful
   indicators of biofouling potential in feedwaters. These images should
   lead to a better appreciation of the impact of TEP in fouling of

Abstract = {{The essential oil of Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) was obtained
   by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. Sixty-two constituents were identified, representing
   98.06\% of the total oil content. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the
   predominant components. The rosemary oil was characterized as having
   prominent (> 5\%) contents of camphor (18.9\%), verbenone (11.3\%),
   alpha-pinene (9.6\%), beta-myrcene (8.6\%), 1,8-cineole (8.0\%), and
   beta-caryophyllene (5.1\%). The antimicrobial activity of the oil as
   well as of its major constituents was tested against the following
   microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitts, Streptococcus
   sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, and
   Enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the
   formation of dental caries in humans. The microdilution method was used
   for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during
   evaluation of the antibacterial activity. The essential oil displayed
   low activity against the selected microorganisms. In the present study,
   the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil. Among
   all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen S. mills was the most
   susceptible and E. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated
   samples. This is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major
   components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the preventive maintenance and inventory control problem
   of a one-machine, one-product manufacturing system subject to random
   breakdowns. Both preventive and corrective interventions have random and
   non-negligible durations during which an excess of final products
   inventory is necessary to fulfill demand. The objective of this study is
   to find the production rate and the preventive maintenance schedule that
   minimize the total cost of maintenance and inventory/backlog in the case
   of periodic preventive maintenance. A near-optimal policy
   characterization with a simple structure is carried out using a
   numerical approach. Such a policy is a combination of a hedging point
   policy and a modified periodic preventive maintenance strategy, under
   which preventive maintenance actions are performed only if the inventory
   level exceeds a sufficient level. A simulation-based experimental
   approach is adopted to achieve a close approximation of the optimal
   control parameters. It is concluded from a sensitivity analysis and a
   comparative analysis that the near-optimal control policy leads to a
   significant cost reduction as compared to the combination of a hedging
   point policy and a classical periodic preventive maintenance policy. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Increasing evidence indicates that adipose tissue is an active endocrine
   organ involved in metabolic syndrome and regulation of inflammation.
   Visceral fat accumulation is a hallmark of both obesity and Crohn's
   disease. Here, we present recent data describing the immune properties
   of intra-abdominal adipose tissue that could link the innate immune
   response to obesity-related disorders and gut inflammation.
   Recent findings
   Innate immune properties of adipocytes have become well characterized
   since recent studies described the Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression
   repertoire and specific TLR ligand responses of adipocytes. Adipokine
   secretion profiles have also been elucidated both in obese patients,
   when they may be involved in obesity-associated metabolic disease, and
   in Crohn's disease. Whereas mesenteric fat hypertrophy and fat wrapping
   of the bowel are characteristic of Crohn's disease, there exists a
   paucity of information concerning this important pathophysiological
   aspect. Our current classical animal models are of limited interest when
   investigating the role of mesenteric fat in gut inflammation. Recent new
   alternative disease paradigms could help to design more specific models
   for elucidating chronic transmural inflammation of the gut.
   Summary
   Obesity and Crohn's disease share common features with the development
   of mesenteric fat that may be involved in gut inflammation. Further
   studies are required to clearly assess the origin and influence of
   intestinal fat deposits upon gut inflammation, notably during Crohn's
   disease development.}},

Abstract = {{The in vitro activity of doripenem was evaluated against a recent
   collection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing
   Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (201
   ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae {[}153 Escherichia coli and 48
   Klebsiella pneumoniae] and 201 P. aeruginosa). Comparator agents
   included amikacin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, cefotaxime,
   ceftazidime piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem. Both
   doripenem and meropenem inhibited 100\% of the ESBL-producing
   Enterobacteriaceae at a parts per thousand currency sign0.5 A mu g/mL.
   For these isolates, the MIC90 of doripenem (0.12 A mu g/mL) was 4-fold
   lower than that of imipenem (0.5 A mu g/mL). Against P. aeruginosa, the
   MIC90 of doripenem and meropenem was 2 A mu g/mL, 4-fold lower than that
   of imipenem (8 A mu g/mL). At an MIC of a parts per thousand currency
   sign2 A mu g/mL, doripenem, meropenem, and imipenem inhibited 90.5\%,
   89.6\%, and 82.1\% of P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Doripenem
   maintained activity against imipenem-nonsusceptible isolates of P.
   aeruginosa; at an MIC of a parts per thousand currency sign4 A mu g/mL,
   it inhibited 15 of the 25 isolates with MICs for imipenem of > 4 A mu
   g/mL. Doripenem is active against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and
   P. aeruginosa isolates. Its activity is similar to that of meropenem and
   slightly better than that of imipenem. The results of this study suggest
   that doripenem could be an alternative therapeutic agent for infections
   caused by these organisms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the foreign bias in international asset allocation.
   Following extant literature in behavioral finance, we argue that a
   society's culture and the cultural distance between two markets play an
   important role in explaining the foreign bias. In particular, we
   hypothesize that the degree of a nation's uncertainty avoidance affects
   the foreign bias (more uncertainty-avoiding countries allocate less to
   foreign markets), as does the degree of a country's individualism (in
   individualistic countries performance is more directly attributed to a
   person and less to teams, causing these individuals to be more
   aggressive in their foreign asset allocations). We further expect that
   the degree of cultural distance between two countries affects the amount
   of money allocated to that market. Based on extensive robustness
   analyses, we find support for our hypotheses on the role of culture in
   international asset allocation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{BIOTECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{631+}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Due to the presence of inhibitors such as extracellular polymeric
   substances (EPSs) and salts, most microbial mat studies have relied on
   harsh methods of direct DNA extraction that result in DNA fragments too
   small for large-insert vector cloning. High molecular weight (H MW) DNA
   is crucial in functional metagenomic studies, because large fragments
   present greater access to genes of interest. Here we report improved
   methodologies for extracting HMW DNA from EPS-rich hypersaline microbial
   mats. The protocol uses a combination of microbial cell separation with
   mechanical and chemical methods for DNA extraction and purification
   followed by precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The protocol
   yields >2 mu g HMW DNA (>48 kb) per gram of mat sample, with A(260:280)
   ratios >1.7. In addition, 16S rRNA gene analysis using denaturing
   gradient gel electrophoresis and pyrosequencing showed that this
   protocol extracts representative DNA from microbial mat communities and
   results in higher overall calculated diversity indices compared with
   three other standard methods of DNA extraction. Our results show the
   importance of validating the DNA extraction methods used in metagenomic
   studies to ensure optimal recovery of microbial richness.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although in-hospital stroke is not a common occurrence, it
   is important to identify what components of stroke care these patients
   receive. The aims of this study were to estimate the clinical
   characteristics, process of stroke care, and mortality in patients
   admitted to hospital with stroke compared with patients with in-hospital
   strokes. Methods: Data from a community-based stroke register
   (1995-2004) in an inner city multiethnic population of 271,817 in South
   London, United Kingdom, were analyzed. Results: From a total of 2402
   patients, 291 (12.1\%) had in-hospital strokes. Patients with
   in-hospital strokes were more likely to be incontinent, be dysphagic,
   have a motor deficit, and have a low level of consciousness (P < .001)
   compared with admitted patients with stroke. Brain imaging was carried
   out more frequently in admitted patients with stroke (P < .001). Access
   to stroke unit care was higher in admitted patients with stroke (P <
   .001). In-hospital patients with stroke had a longer mean length of stay
   (55.9 days) compared with admitted patients with stroke (37.9 days, P <
   .001). There were no significant differences between the groups for
   receipt of physiotherapy or occupational therapy after discharge (P =
   .232) or receipt of speech and language therapy (P = .345). After
   adjustment of case mix variables, in-hospital patients with stroke were
   less likely to undergo imaging (odds ratio {[}OR] = 0.54, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.33-0.89, P = .015). In-hospital patients
   with stroke were less likely to be treated in a stroke unit (OR = 0.33,
   95\% CI = 0.22-0.50, P < .001) and prescribed antiplatelet therapy at 3
   months (OR = 0.51, 95\% CI = 0.30-0.88, P = .015). By 3 months,
   in-hospital patients with stroke were more likely to have died (P <
   .001), although this was not significant after case mix adjustment (OR =
   1.39, 95\% CI = 0.90-2.15, P = .135). Conclusion: This study
   demonstrated that in-hospital patients with stroke had worse stroke
   severity, and poorer access to a number of components of stroke care
   compared with admitted patients with stroke. All hospitals should
   include, in their stroke policies and guidelines, evidence-based
   pathways that prioritize the needs of patients who have a stroke while
   in hospital.}},

Abstract = {{A critical success factor in the practice of Open Innovation is the
   timely identification of opportunities for out-licensing a firm's
   technologies outside its core business. This can be particularly
   challenging for small- and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs), because of
   their focussed business portfolio, specialized knowledge basis, and
   limited financial resources that can be devoted to innovation
   activities. The paper illustrates a quick and easy-to-use methodology
   for the identification of viable opportunities for out-licensing a
   firm's technologies outside its core business. The method uses
   established TRIZ instruments in combination with non-financial weighting
   and ranking techniques and portfolio management tools. It has been
   developed by the authors in collaboration with an Italian SME working in
   the packaging industry.}},

Abstract = {{At the turn of a decade of intensive wishful thinking, ``mesenchymal
   stem cells'' are changing their profile, while retaining their charm. As
   hopes to turn bone into brain or vice versa seem on the wane, we learn
   (1) that the archetypal ``mesenchymal stem cell,'' the skeletal stem
   cell found in the bone marrow, can be directly identified as a
   specialized type of mural cell/pericyte, found in the wall of sinusoids
   and long known as adventitial reticular cells; (2) that bone marrow
   skeletal stem cells are also defined by expression of CD146, and can
   self-renew in vivo, while giving rise to skeletal tissues, and therefore
   earn consideration as bona fide stem cells; (3) that a broader class of
   microvascular mural cells endowed with clonogenicity and progenitor
   properties may exist in other tissues, although their true potency needs
   to be firmly established by stringent assays and thorough comparisons
   across tissues; (4) that bone marrow skeletal stem cells display unique
   angiopoietic and hematopoietic niche-related functions, consisting in
   their ability to transfer the hematopoietic microenvironment and to
   guide the assembly of microvascular networks, which seem to define their
   inherent biology; and (5) that use of skeletal stem cells as disease
   models, and as models of high-risk strategies for cell and gene therapy
   specifically in incurable skeletal diseases, may provide new challenges
   for the next decade, and perhaps reward for medicine in the one that
   follows.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental method is developed to identify a suitable model of

   considered: an elastic-plastic model where the in-elasticity is
   considered due to permanent straining of the adhesive and an
   elastic-damage model where the in-elasticity is due to a reduction in
   elastic stiffness. Simulations show that the evaluated property is
   sensitive to the choice of model. In the experimental study of an
   engineering epoxy adhesive, the elastic-damage model fits the
   experiments. The study also reveals that plasticity and damage
   accumulated at the crack tip influences the evaluated fracture
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to detect extremely small forces and nanoscale displacements
   is vital for disciplines such as precision spin-resonance imaging(1),
   microscopy(2), and tests of fundamental physical phenomena(3-5). Current
   force-detection sensitivity limits have surpassed 1 aN Hz(-1/2) (refs
   6,7) through coupling of nanomechanical resonators to a variety of
   physical readout systems(1,7-10). Here, we demonstrate that crystals of
   trapped atomic ions(11,12) behave as nanoscale mechanical oscillators
   and may form the core of exquisitely sensitive force and displacement
   detectors. We report the detection of forces with a sensitivity of
   390+/-150 yN Hz(-1/2), which is more than three orders of magnitude
   better than existing reports using nanofabricated devices(7), and
   discriminate ion displacements of similar to 18 nm. Our technique is
   based on the excitation of tunable normal motional modes in an ion
   trap(13) and detection through phase-coherent Doppler
   velocimetry(14,15), and should ultimately allow force detection with a
   sensitivity better than 1 yN Hz(-1/2) (ref. 16). Trapped-ion-based
   sensors could enable scientists to explore new regimes in materials
   science where augmented force, field and displacement sensitivity may be
   traded against reduced spatial resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Organic cotton is a new industrial crop product. Field experiments were
   conducted to determine the effects of cultural systems and varieties on
   the growth, fiber quality and yield components of cotton crop (Gossypium

   out in a split plot design with four replicates, two main plots (organic
   and conventional system) and two sub-plots (cotton varieties: Athena and
   Campo). There were no significant differences between the organic and
   conventional system for cotton growth, yield and fiber quality. The
   results suggest that the soil N released from both the inorganic (80 :
   40 : 40 kg ha(-1) N: P2O5 : K2O) and organic pool (green manure) were
   sufficient to maintain good growth. Inferior-quality fiber was produced
   in the variety. Campo, which had the lowest fiber fineness (micronaire),
   strength, length and reflection. In addition, this variety had the
   highest fiber elongation and yellowness. There were no significant
   differences between varieties as far as uniformity and leaf trash ratio
   are concerned. A positive correlation was observed between fiber
   strength and length. However, a negative correlation was found between
   lint yield and fiber strength.}},

Abstract = {{Disguised handwriting is problematic for forensic document examiners
   (FDEs) and attracts higher misleading and inconclusive rates on
   authorship opinions than does genuine writing (Found B, Rogers D,
   International Graphonomics Society, 2005). There are currently no
   published empirical data on FDEs' expertise in distinguishing between
   natural and disguised writing behavior. This paper reports on the skill
   of FDEs for determining the writing process of 140 pairs of natural and
   disguised writings and compares their results with those of a control
   group of laypeople. A significant difference was found between the
   examiner and lay group. FDEs' expertise is characterized by their
   conservatism, where FDEs express a higher proportion of inconclusive
   opinions (23.1\% for FDEs compared to 8.4\% for the control group). This
   leads to the FDEs expressing a smaller percentage of misleading
   responses when calling writings as either naturally written or disguised
   (4.3\% for FDEs compared with 12.2\% for the control group).}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Ethylene insensitive 2 (EIN2), an integral membrane protein of the ER
   network, has been identified as the central regulator of the ethylene
   signaling pathway. Still, the mechanism by which the ethylene signal is
   transferred from the receptors to EIN2 has not been solved yet. Here, we
   show that protein phosphorylation is a key mechanism to control the
   interaction of EIN2 and the receptors. In vivo and in vitro fluorescence
   studies reveal that the kinase domain of the receptors is essential for
   the interaction. Cyanide, an ethylene agonist, which is known to reduce
   auto-phosphorylation of the ethylene receptor ethylene resistant 1
   (ETR1) or a mutation in the kinase domain of ETR1 that prevents
   auto-phosphorylation (H353A), increases the affinity of the receptors
   for EIN2. On the other hand, mimicking permanent auto-phosphorylation of
   ETR1 as in the mutant H353E releases the EIN2-ETR1 interaction from the
   control by the plant hormone. Based on our data, we propose a novel
   model on the integration of EIN2 in the ethylene signaling cascade.}},

Abstract = {{Hexagonal single crystals of europium trifluoromethanesulfonate
   nonahydrate (EuTFMS) have been prepared. The paramagnetic susceptibility
   perpendicular to the symmetry axis (c-axis, chi(perpendicular to)) and
   the principal magnetic anisotropy (Delta chi = chi(parallel
   to)-chi(perpendicular to)) were measured in the temperature range of
   300-13 and 300-80 K, respectively. The paramagnetic susceptibility
   parallel to the c-axis (chi(parallel to)) was calculated using the
   values of chi(perpendicular to) and Delta chi. chi(parallel to) and
   chi(perpendicular to) increase slowly with decrease of temperature and
   below similar to 93 K, chi(perpendicular to) is more or less constant.
   But chi(parallel to) levels off below similar to 137 K. The calculated
   value of the effective magnetic moment (P-eff) of Eu3+ in the
   crystalline environment of EuTFMS decreases with lowering of
   temperature. The Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of
   EuTFMS were recorded in the wavenumber range of 10-1800 and 370-6000
   cm(-1), respectively. A good theoretical simulation of the observed
   magnetic properties including the CF Stark energies of the ground term
   (F-7) extracted from the Raman and FTIR spectra of Eu3+ in EuTFMS have
   been achieved using one electron crystal field (CF) analysis. The
   electronic specific heat and other relevant CF dependent hyperfine
   properties, viz, nuclear quadrupole splitting and hyperfine specific
   heat have been computed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Intensity in MR Imaging of Intraplaque Hemorrhage}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Calcium can potentially shorten T1, generating
   high signal intensity in GREs. Because IPH appears as high signal
   intensity in MRIPH and the surface effects of calcium can potentially
   shorten T1 of surrounding water protons, the purpose of this study was
   to evaluate whether the high signal intensity seen on MRIPH could be
   attributed solely to IPH and not calcification.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy
   were imaged by using MRIPH. Calcification was assessed by scanning
   respective endarterectomy specimens with a tabletop MicroCT.
   MRIPH/MicroCT correlation used an 8-segment template. Two readers
   evaluated images from both modalities. Agreement between MRIPH/MicroCT
   was measured by calculating Cohen kappa.
   RESULTS: High signal intensity was seen in 58.8\% and 68.9\% (readers 1
   and 2, respectively) of MRIPH segments, whereas calcification was seen
   in 44.7\% and 32.1\% (readers 1 and 2, respectively) of MicroCT
   segments. High signal intensity seen by MRIPH showed very good but
   inverse agreement to calcification (kappa = -0.90; P < .0001, 95\% CI,
   -0.93 to -0.86, reader 1; and kappa = -0.74; P < .0001; 95\% CI, -0.81
   to -0.69, reader 2). Most interesting, high signal intensity
   demonstrated excellent agreement with lack of calcification on MicroCT
   (kappa = 0.92; P < .0001; 95\% CI, 0.89-0.94, reader 1; and kappa =
   0.97; P < .0001; 95\% CI, 0.96-0.99, reader 2). In a very small number
   of segments, high signal intensity was seen in MRIPH, and calcification
   was seen on MicroCT; however, these represented a very small proportion
   of segments with high signal intensity (5.9\% and 1.6\%, readers 1 and
   2, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: High signal intensity, therefore, reliably identified IPH,
   known to describe complicated plaque, rather than calcification, which
   is increasingly recognized as identifying more stable vascular disease.}},

   flavor violation with low tan beta}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The D0 collaboration has recently announced evidence for a dimuon CP
   asymmetry in B-d,B-s decays of order one percent. If confirmed, this
   asymmetry requires new physics. We argue that for minimally flavor
   violating (MFV) new physics, and at low tan beta = v(u)/v(d), there are
   only two four-quark operators (Q(2,3)) that can provide the required CP
   violating effect. The scale of such new physics must lie below 260GeV
   root tan beta. The effect is universal in the B-s and B-d systems,
   leading to S-psi K similar to sin2 beta - 0.15 and S-psi phi similar to
   0.25. The effects on is an element of(K) and on electric dipole moments
   are negligible. The most plausible mechanism is tree-level scalar
   exchange. MFV supersymmetry with low tan beta will be excluded. Finally,
   we explain how a pattern of deviations from the Standard Model
   predictions for S-psi phi, S psi K and is an element of(K) can be used
   to test MFV and, if MFV holds, to probe its structure in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in the orientation and cross-sectional shape of filamentous
   microfossils provide quantitative measures for characterizing them and
   probing their native mechanical structure. Here, we determine the
   tangent correlation length, which is the characteristic length scale for
   the variation in direction of a sinuous curve, for both a suite of
   Precambrian filamentous microfossils and six strains of modem
   filamentous cyanobacteria, all with diameters of a few microns. Among
   1.9-2-Ga microfossils, Gunflintia grandis, Gunflintia minuta and
   Eomycetopsis filiformis possess, respectively, correlation lengths of
   360 +/- 40 mu m, 670 +/- 40 mu m and 700 +/- 100 mu m in two dimensions.
   Hundreds of times larger than the filament diameters, these values lie
   in the same range as the cyanobacteria Geitlerinema and Pseudanabaena,
   but are smaller than several strains of Oscillatoria. In contrast, the
   2-Ga microfossil trichome Halythrix, is found to have a short
   correlation length of 29 +/- 4 mu m in two dimensions. Micron-wide
   pyritic replacement filaments observed in 3.23-Ga volcanogenic deposits
   also display a modest correlation length of 100 +/- 15 mu m in two
   dimensions. Sequences of species in two genera of our modern
   cyanobacteria possess tangent correlation lengths that rise as a power
   of the filament diameter D-D-3.3 +/- 1 for Oscillatoria and D-5.1 +/- 1
   for Geitlerinema. These results can be compared with power-law scaling
   of D-3 for hollow tubes and D-4 for solid cylinders that is expected
   from continuum mechanics. Extrapolating the observed scaling behavior to
   smaller filament diameters, the measured correlation length of the
   pyrite filaments is consistent with modern Geitlerinema whereas that of
   Halythrix lies not far from modern Oscillatoria, suggesting that there
   may be structural similarities among these genera.}},

Abstract = {{T cell receptor (TCR) structure and function have been thoroughly
   studied for decades Production and analyses of knock-out and knock-in
   mice with mutations in the CD3 chains have contributed significantly to
   these studies The generation of such gene-modified mice relies on the
   availability of suitable embryonic stem (ES) cell lines Traditionally ES
   cell lines from the 129 mouse strains have been used followed by
   backcrossing to the C57BL/6 strain In the present study we demonstrate
   the existence of polymorphisms in the CD3 genes from mice of the 129 and
   C57BL/6 strains These polymorphisms result in amino acid substitutions
   in the ectodomains of both the CD3 delta and CD3 epsilon chains in 129
   mice compared to C57BL/6 mice The amino acid substitutions do not change
   the stoichiometry or surface expression level of the TCR complex in 1291
   cells but cause reduced anti-CD3 antibody binding to 1291 cells Further
   when stimulated with mitogenic anti-CD3 antibodies T cells from the 129
   strains show reduced expression of the activation marker CD69 Ca2+ flux
   IL-2 production and proliferative responses compared to C57BL/6 T cells
   These findings demonstrate that polymorphisms of the CD3 delta and
   epsilon ectodomains exist in mice and that some of these polymorphisms
   lead to amino acid substitutions which cause structural changes and
   affect anti-CD3 antibody binding Thus functional T cell studies should
   be interpreted with caution when anti-CD3 antibodies are used for
   stimulation of T cells derived from gene-modified mice originating from
   129 ES cell lines (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Objective. In most patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM), including
   aggressive SM (ASM) and mast cell (MC) leukemia (MCL), neoplastic cells
   express the oncogenic KIT mutation D816V, which confers resistance to
   imatinib. Cladribine (2CdA) is a nucleoside analog that has been
   introduced as a promising agent for treatment of advanced SM.
   Materials and Methods. We examined the in vitro effects of 2CdA on
   growth of neoplastic MC, and the in vivo effects of 2CdA (0.13 mg/kg/day
   intravenously, days 1-5; three to eight cycles) in seven patients with
   advanced SM.
   Results. Cladribine was found to inhibit growth of primary MC and the MC
   line HMC-1 in a dose-dependent manner, with lower IC50 values recorded
   in HMC-1.2 cells harboring KIT D816V (IC50: 10 ng/mL) compared to
   HMC-1.1 cells lacking KIT D816V (IC50: 300 ng/mL). In two patients with
   progressive smoldering SM. 2CdA produced a long-lasting response with a
   sustained decrease in serum tryptase levels, whereas in patients with
   progressive ASM or MCL, 2CdA showed little if any effects. The drug was
   well-tolerated in most cases. However, one patient developed a massive
   generalized purulent long-lasting skin rash. The antiproliferative
   effects of 2CdA on MC were found to be associated with morphologic signs
   of apoptosis and caspase cleavage. Cladribine did not counteract the
   kinase activity of KIT D816V or KIT-downstream signaling molecules.
   Conclusions. Cladribine may be a promising agent tor treatment of
   progressive smoldering KIT D816V(+) SM. In rapidly progressing ASM or
   MCL, additional or alternative drugs are required to induce long-lasting
   antineoplastic effects. (C) 2010 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem

Abstract = {{Using the long-tailed tit (Aegithalos c. caudatus) as an example of the
   so-called irruptive species, the ecophysiological characteristics (body
   mass, fat reserves) and migration speed during autumn period were
   analyzed. The mean body mass and the median fat score did not depend on
   the number of migrating individuals. There was no evidence of the
   so-called stress in birds, participating in migration: migrants had even
   higher fat reserves than residents, while no significant difference in
   the body mass was recorded. The increase in fat reserves in the
   long-tailed tit during migration period was similar to the seasonal
   changes in energy reserves known for typical migrants. This makes it
   possible for late-migrating individuals to maintain higher total speed
   of migration compared to early-migrating ones. Basing on the obtained
   data, we conclude that the ecophysiological characteristics of the
   long-tailed tits migrating in autumn are similar to those of regular
   migrants.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research highlights the presence of social anxiety disorder
   related to disfiguring diseases, although DSM-IV precludes the diagnosis
   of social anxiety disorder related to a medical condition. The present
   study investigated the frequency and severity of social anxiety disorder

   (n=50). Social anxiety was diagnosed in 16\% of patients with
   Parkinson's disease and 2\% of the comparison subjects. Regression
   analysis revealed younger age and depression as predictive factors of
   social anxiety. This study supported the likelihood of social anxiety
   disorder as a comorbid condition in Parkinson's disease. Revision of the
   criteria for social anxiety disorder in future diagnostic systems is
   necessary for the detection and management of these patients.

Abstract = {{A DNA biosensor is presented that is based on gold interdigitated
   nanoelectrodes of 100 nm width and 250 nm pitch. A single-strand
   oligonucleotide acts as the capture probe. Because of its nanometer
   dimensions, the device shows improved sensitivity when compared to
   similar systems. This encouraged us to perform a direct and unlabelled
   detection. After incubation with the DNA target, the impedance spectrum
   was recorded between 1 kHz and 10 MHz to obtain the net capacitance
   change. The use of a biotinylated DNA signalling probe permitted the
   integration of an amplification stage in a sandwich format that employs
   streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles. The strategy was preliminarily
   tested by detecting the breast cancer related BRCA1 gene, where the
   noncomplementary, wild and mutated forms were easily differentiated at a
   concentration level of 3 mu M (corresponding to a 30 pmol quantity).}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on a controlled experiment using undergraduate
   African American students at one of the United States' Historically
   Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). Information technology rich
   multimedia instructional materials were implemented in an attempt to
   increase the level of perceived leadership skills in the classroom. A
   comparison was conducted to examine the various attitudes and
   perceptions of minority students using multimedia case studies versus
   traditional teaching methods. The results suggest that the use of
   multimedia case studies in minority classrooms has the potential to
   improve perceived leadership skills more so than traditional teaching
   methods. It is important to note, however, that the social, cultural,
   and psychological nuances associated with individual ethnic groups are
   extremely complex and possibly beyond the scope of this research.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli are important
   serotypes of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) subgroup that cause
   attaching and effacing lesions in enterocytes by producing verotoxins or
   shiga-like toxins resulting in haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and haemolytic
   uremic syndrome (HUS). The aim of this study was to detect these
   serotypes specially E. coli O157:H7 in stool samples of patients with
   diarrhoea and identification of virulence genes (STX1, STX2, Hly and
   EAE) in Shahrekord-Iran area using PCR technique.
   Methods: Two hundred diarrhoeal stool samples of patients were collected
   through 2007-2008. Microbiological and biochemical examinations were
   done to detect the E. coli. Serological tests carried out to identify
   the 0157 or O157:H7 serotypes.
   Results: Of the 58 E. coli isolates, 16(27.6\%) were detected as STX1
   carrying E. coli, four (6.9\%) carrying STX2, eight (13.8\%) carrying
   both STX1 and STX2, and 12 (20.7\%) were Hly carrying E. coli, but none
   of the isolates contained EAE gene. None of the isolates were E. coli
   O157 or O157:H7 serotypes.
   Interpretation \& conclusions: Our results revealed that verotoxigenic
   E. coli isolates other than O157 serotype were involved in causing
   diarrhoea in Shahrekord-Iran.}},

Abstract = {{This essay playfully takes Patrick Geddes's categories of work, place
   and folk to frame an autobiographical account in which I describe my
   origins and development as a historian and museum curator at the Science
   Museum, London. My parents George and Diana Boon, both classicists by
   education, created a home imbued with a deep respect for the past,
   history and archaeology. This created the thesis for a dialectic whose
   antithesis was my fascination with modernity, technology and science;
   synthesis came with my discovery at university of the academic study of
   history of science. The dialectic has remained in play as my career has
   flowered at the Science Museum, an institution whose success may in
   large part be put down to the creative tension created between its roles
   in representing the past and present of science. In my account, I
   highlight key individuals and books - including Anthony Bertram's
   Design, Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker, Foucault's The Order of Things,
   and De Certeau's The Practice of Everyday Life - that have had a
   particularly profound impact on how I think as a historian and curator.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of a close reading of popular and medical texts which
   address a debate over the ethics of clinical drug trials funded by the
   United States and designed mainly for sub-Saharan Africa, I argue that
   international public health discourse about infant HIV infection in that
   region reflects and legitimates a neo-imperialist, anti-reproductive
   justice ideology. Participants share a fetal-centered logic that
   US-funded biomedicine must shoulder the burden of rescuing sub-Saharan
   Africa from itself by using the bodies of HIV-positive pregnant women to
   transmit biomedicine's magic bullet-antiretroviral drugs-to the next
   generation. The survival of the fetus, disguised as the well-being of
   the HIV-positive woman and accomplished by the magic of biomedical
   research, becomes the survival of a region otherwise doomed by its
   present state of economic, political, and medical incapacity. This
   version of what queer theorist Lee Edelman (2004, No Future: Queer
   Theory and the Death Drive) calls ``reproductive futurism{''} redounds
   to the benefit of the more explicitly women-hating and nationalist
   ideologies of still-powerful right-wing movements against reproductive
   and sexual rights.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine prevalence rates and identify patient
   characteristics associated with depression alcohol use disorders and
   nicotine dependence among individuals admitted to a general teaching
   hospital Method Using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and
   Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test we assessed 4 352 consecutive
   medical and surgical patients admitted over a 13-month period The
   patients were also asked to report their daily cigarette smoking habits
   during the last month Multiple logistic regression analyses were
   performed and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated Results The mean age of
   the sample was 49 3 years, and 56 6\% were male Prevalence rates of
   depression alcohol use disorders and nicotine dependence were,
   respectively, 14\%, 9 8\% and 16 9\% In the multivariate analysis
   depression was associated with previous suicide attempts (OR = 8 7),
   lower level of education (OR = 3 6), prior use of psychotropic
   medications (OR = 3 1) cancer (OR = I 7) and pain (OR = I 7) Alcohol use
   disorders were associated with male sex (OR = 6 3) smoking (OR = 3 5)
   admission for an external cause of injury such as a traffic accident (OR
   = 2 4) and previous suicide attempts (OR = 2 3) Nicotine dependence was
   associated with alcohol use disorders (OR = 3 4) young adulthood (OR = 2
   3) widowhood (OR = 2 2) and previous suicide attempts (OR = I 8)
   Conclusion This is the largest sample of medical and surgical patients
   ever surveyed with standardized screening Instruments in a general
   hospital in Brazil The high prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders
   and the profiles of the patients evaluated in this study underscore the
   need to develop methods that are more effective for detecting and
   managing such disorders Hospital admission should be considered a major
   opportunity for the detection of psychiatric disorders and the
   subsequent implementation of the appropriate specific treatment

Abstract = {{The excitation spectrum of URu2Si2 in the superconducting state has been
   investigated by a precise neutron-scattering experiment. A weak but
   clear positive energy shift of similar to 40 mu eV has been detected in
   the superconducting phase (at T = 400 mK) for the resonance at Q(0) =
   (1,0,0). For the resonance at Q(1) = (0.6,0,0), a two times smaller
   shift is observed but with an incertitude of the same order than this
   shift. This result is in agreement with our previous results indicating
   that the wave-vector Q(0) is connected with the order parameters of the
   hidden order and of superconductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Cystamine has shown significant neuroprotective properties in
   preclinical studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease
   (HD). Cysteamine, its FDA-approved reduced form, is scheduled to be
   tested for clinical efficacy in HD patients. Here, we studied the key
   cystamine metabolites, namely cysteamine, hypotaurine and taurine, as
   well as cysteine, in order to identify which one is more distinctively
   responsible for the neuroprotective action of cystamine. After a single
   administration of cystamine (10, 50 or 200 mg/kg), naive mice were
   perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 1, 3, 12, 24 or 48 h
   post-injection and brain and plasma samples were analyzed by two
   distinct HPLC methods. Although plasma levels remained under the
   detection threshold, significant increases in cysteamine brain levels
   were detected with the 50 and 200 mg/kg doses in mice perfused 1 and 3 h
   following cystamine injection. To further assess cysteamine as the
   candidate molecule for pre-clinical and clinical trials in PD, we
   evaluated its capacity to cross the blood brain barrier. Using an in
   situ cerebral perfusion technique, we determined that the brain
   transport coefficient (Clup) of cysteamine (259 mu M) was 0.15 +/- 0.02
   mu L/g/s and was increased up to 0.34 +/- 0.07 mu L/g/s when co-perfused
   in the presence of cysteine. Taken together, these results strongly
   suggest that cysteamine is the neuroactive metabolite of cystamine and
   may further support its therapeutic use in neurodegenerative diseases,
   particularly in HD and PD.}},

Abstract = {{An indicator can be defined as a statistic used as part of an assessment
   exercise. There have been three relatively distinct waves of interest in
   indicators at the national level. Indicator work creates both
   opportunities and hazards for federal statistical agencies. Indicators
   not only increase the accessibility of federal statistics but also
   expose statistical agencies to charges of partisanship that can
   jeopardize both the credibility of their products and the agencies'
   abilities to accomplish their core mission of collecting data from an
   increasingly wary public. Managing the tension between the scientific
   and political dimensions of indicator work involves acknowledging the
   value-laden nature of indicator development and establishing a clear
   division of labor, with political entities assuming responsibility for
   grappling with the most obviously normative issues and statistical
   agencies limiting their involvement in such work to the provision of
   statistical scientific expertise.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effects of
   different diets on spermatophore quality and tissue biochemical
   composition in male pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus paulensis. The
   experiment was carried out with the three following treatments: fresh
   food, commercial diet and a mix of fresh food and commercial diet.
   Spermatophore quality was evaluated by spermatophore weight, sperm
   count, melanization and spermatophore absence rates. Biochemical
   analyses of glucose, triacylglycerides and protein were completed for
   hemolymph, hepatopancreas and muscle. Spermatophore weight and sperm
   count were not significantly different among treatments (P>0.05). At the
   end of the experiment, shrimp fed only with commercial diet showed
   highest melanization rate and spermatophore absence, 42.85\% and
   42.85\%, respectively. To shrimp fed only with fresh food the values
   melanization and spermatophore absence were 15.38\% and 0\%,
   respectively and the mix 12.51\% and 37.50\%, respectively. Hemolymph
   glucose concentration was significantly higher in commercial diet
   treatment (31.19 mg/dL) than fresh food (12.24 mg/dL) and mix treatments
   (10.97 mg/dL). Farfantepenaeus paulensis broodstocks fed only the
   commercial diet may present decrease spermatophore quality. (C) 2010

   a phox homology (PX) domain that binds to phosphoinositides and are
   involved in intracellular trafficking in eukaryotic cells. We therefore
   studied whether sorting nexins, particularly sorting nexin 3 (SNX3),
   play a role in Salmonella infection. We found that SNX3 transiently
   localized to SCVs at early times post invasion (10 min) and presented a
   striking tubulation phenotype in the vicinity of SCVs at later times
   (30-60 min). The bacterial effector SopB, which is known to promote
   PI(3)P production on SCVs, was required for the formation of SNX3
   tubules. In addition, RAB5 was also required for the formation of SNX3
   tubules. Depletion of SNX3 by siRNA impaired RAB7 and LAMP1 recruitment
   to the SCV. Moreover, the formation of Salmonella-induced filaments
   (Sifs) was altered by SNX3 knock-down. Therefore, SNX3 plays a
   significant role in regulating the maturation of SCVs.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To study the effect of the reproductive state of female
   alpacas (ie, maiden {[}never bred before], barren {[}bred but failed to
   conceive or maintain pregnancy in previous breeding season], or gave
   birth and currently lactating) on embryonic mortality rate.
   Animals-167 female alpacas (54 lactating, 44 barren, and 69 maiden) that
   ovulated following a single breeding.
   Procedures During the first 45 days following breeding, female alpacas
   underwent periodic transrectal ultrasonography to determine the presence
   or absence of an embryonic vesicle. Serum progesterone concentrations
   were determined during the same period. Embryonic survival rate was
   analyzed for each group of females (lactating, barren, and maiden).
   Results The presence of an embryonic vesicle or embryo was positively
   associated with high serum progesterone concentrations (> 2 ng/mL). The
   embryonic mortality rate in barren females (21/44 {[}477\%]) was
   significantly higher than in maiden (20/69 {[}29.0\%]) and lactating
   (16/54 {[}29.6\%]) females. In females that underwent embryonic loss (n
   = 57), 3 patterns of events in terms of serum progesterone
   concentrations were identified: concomitant decrease of serum
   progesterone concentration and embryonic loss (24/57 {[}42.1\%]),
   decrease in serum progesterone concentration before embryonic loss
   (12/57 {[}21.1\%]), and persistent serum progesterone concentrations
   beyond embryonic loss (21/57 {[}36.8\%]). Patterns of serum progesterone
   concentration and embryonic loss did not differ significantly among
   lactating, barren, and maiden female alpacas.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Embryonic loss in alpacas occurred
   without any discernible pattern in serum progesterone concentrations.
   Barren female alpacas had the highest embryonic mortality rate. (Am J

Abstract = {{WILLIAM D. SHANNON, `Adversarial Map-Making in Pre-Reformation
   Lancashire'. A map in the National Archives dated to 1531 showing part
   of the Fylde in Lancashire has been published on several occasions; but
   its relationship to another map in the National Archives has not
   previously been recognised. These two maps were made by the opposing
   parties in a dispute before the court of the Duchy of Lancaster, and may
   be the earliest examples of adversarial map-making in a case before an
   equity court. The case concerned land which had apparently long been
   regarded as intercommon, but which was now being claimed to be in
   exclusive ownership. The newly recognised map was made to illustrate
   recently acquired documentary evidence as to the ownership of the land
   in question. This map appears broadly trustworthy, and was accepted as
   such by the court; but the defence map seems rather to have been
   designed to mislead. In recent years the defence map has been regarded
   as evidence for the appearance of the locality concerned in the 1530s,
   but this study shows that it was in fact regarded by the court as
   unreliable, thus highlighting the need to treat all maps other than
   those actually commissioned by the courts themselves as partial and
   therefore suspect.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to exogenously present cell-surface receptors in
   high-affinity conformations in a synthetic system offers an opportunity
   to provide host cells with protection from pathogenic toxins. This
   strategy requires improvement of the synthetic receptor binding affinity
   against its native counterpart, particularly with polyvalent toxins
   where clustering of membrane receptors can hinder binding. Here we
   demonstrate that reconstituted lipoprotein, nanometer-sized discoidal
   lipid bilayers bounded by apolipoprotein and functionalized by
   incorporation of pathogen receptors, provides a means to enhance
   toxin-receptor binding through molecular-level control over the receptor
   microenvironment (specifically, its rigidity, composition, and
   heterogeneity). Using a Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based
   assay, we found that reconstituted lipoprotein incorporating low
   concentrations of ganglioside monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1)
   binds polymeric cholera toxin with significantly higher affinity than
   liposomes or supported lipid bilayers, most likely a result of the
   enhanced control over receptor clustering provided by the lipoprotein
   platform. Using wide-area epifluorescence, we found that this enhanced
   binding capacity can be effectively utilized to divert cholera toxin
   away from populations of healthy mammalian cells. In summary, we found
   that reconstitutions of high-density lipoprotein can be engineered to
   include specific pathogen receptors; that their pathogen binding
   affinity is altered, presumably due to attenuation of receptor
   aggregation; and that these assemblies are effective at protecting cells
   from biological toxins.-Bricarello, D.A., E.J. Mills, J. Petrlova, J.C.

Abstract = {{Background
   Reports of doxycycline-induced toxicity are limited despite common use
   of this antibiotic to treat infectious respiratory disorders in calves.
   Objective
   To describe previously unreported kidney lesions and diagnostic test
   results in doxycycline-overdosed calves and to compare these results
   with other findings reported previously.
   Animals
   Thirty-two calves that presented with adverse effects after receiving
   high doses of doxycycline as a treatment for mild respiratory disorders.
   Method
   Retrospective review of medical records.
   Results
   Clinical examination identified mainly lethargy, dyspnea, cough, tongue
   paresia or paralysis associated with dysphagia and sialorrhea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea, and signs of myopathy. Blood analysis indicated
   increases in creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate
   aminotransferase, and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities and increased
   serum creatinine and urea concentrations. ECG recordings and Doppler
   echocardiography examination identified ventricular premature beats and
   a decrease in left ventricular global and systolic function,
   respectively. Necropsy and histopathology disclosed necrosis of the
   myocardium, tongue, and some striated muscles, acute renal tubular
   necrosis, and fatty degeneration or congestion of the liver.
   Conclusions
   Most of these findings corroborate previous observations made in
   doxycycline-overdosed calves, and further suggest myocardial and
   striated muscular toxicity as well as renal toxicity in
   doxycycline-overdosed calves.}},

Abstract = {{Lightning damages millions of dollars of electrical equipment each year.
   With the protective devices currently available, this should not happen.
   Unfortunately, in most cases, little consideration is given to the
   effects of grounding on the effectiveness of surge suppression. When the
   surge suppression device cannot be directly connected at the terminals
   of the equipment to be protected, the impedance of the connecting means
   must be examined. High ground resistance and lead inductance greatly
   diminish the effectiveness of surge suppression. This paper describes a
   circuit approach to lightning protection starting with a discussion of
   infinite ground, ground resistance, and lead inductance. These concepts
   are then applied to various types of pole-top grounding. Normally, the
   grounding terminal of transformer secondary windings connects to the
   common terminal of the lightning arresters. This is demonstrated to be a
   central cause for much of the ensuing damage. Usually, several surge
   suppression devices are connected to a single ground wire, and the
   transient voltages on that wire not only reduce the effectiveness of the
   devices but, because of their bilateral characteristics, can also
   actually cause damage. Multiple ground wires terminating on a primary
   low-resistance ground have proven very effective in minimizing equipment
   damage. The integrity of ground bonding for personnel safety is still
   preserved. The only alteration is how and where ground wires are
   connected. This solution greatly increases the efficacy of lightning
   protection, without sacrificing safety or code compliance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Deficits in cognitive flexibility and response inhibition
   have been linked to perturbations in cortico-striatal-thalamic circuitry
   in adult obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Although similar cognitive
   deficits have been identified in pediatric OCD, few neuroimaging studies
   have been conducted to examine its neural correlates in the developing
   brain. In this study, we tested hypotheses regarding group differences
   in the behavioral and neural correlates of cognitive flexibility in a
   pediatric OCD and a healthy comparison (HC) sample. Method: In this
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, a pediatric sample
   of 10- to 17-year-old subjects, 15 with OCD and 20 HC, completed a
   set-shifting task. The task, requiring an extradimensional shift to
   identify a target, examines cognitive flexibility. Within each block,
   the dimension (color or shape) that identified the target either
   alternated (i.e., mixed) or remained unchanged (i.e., repeated).
   Results: Compared with the HC group, the OCD group tended to be slower
   to respond to trials within mixed blocks. Compared with the HC group,
   the OCD group exhibited less left inferior frontal gyrus/BA47 activation
   in the set-shifting contrast (i.e., HC > OCD, mixed versus repeated);
   only the HC group exhibited significant activation in this region. The
   correlation between set shifting-induced right caudate activation and
   shift cost (i.e., reaction time differential in response to mixed versus
   repeated trials) was significantly different between HC and OCD groups,
   in that we found a positive correlation in HC and a negative correlation

Abstract = {{Secreted phosphoprotein-24 kDa (spp24) is a bone morphogenetic protein
   (BMP)-binding protein isolated from bone. It exists in a number of size
   forms and is hypothesized to function as a BMP latency protein and/or a
   ``slow release{''} mechanism for BMPs involved in bone turnover and
   repair. We have examined the hypothesis that proteolytic modification of
   the C-terminus of spp24 affects its BMP-2-binding properties and
   bioactivity in the BMP-2-stimulated ectopic bone forming bioassay. Three
   different size forms of recombinant spp24 that correspond to predicted
   18.1 kDa, 16.0 kDa, and 14.5 kDa proteolytic products were compared to
   full-length (fl) spp24. One of these forms (spp18.1) we hypothesize to
   be the protein which Urist initially, but apparently inaccurately,
   called ``BMP.{''} Only full-length spp24 completely inhibited
   BMP-2-induced bone formation. The 18.1 kD a truncated isoform of spp24
   which we hypothesize to be Urist's protein did not. The inhibitory
   capacity of the proteins was correlated with their kinetic constants,
   assessed by surface plasmon resonance. At the highest, inhibitory, dose
   of spp24 and its derivatives, k(d) ({''}stability{''}) best predicted
   the extent of ectopic bone formation whereas at the lowest dose, which
   was not inhibitory, k(a) ({''}recognition{''}) best predicted the extent
   of ectopic bone formation. We conclude that proteolytic processing of
   spp24 affects the interaction of this protein with BMP-2 and this
   affects the function of the protein. (C) 2010 Orthopaedic Research

Abstract = {{The `working poor' may not exceed the poverty threshold despite
   full-time (or even double) employment. The general relationship between
   poverty and illness is understood, but little is known about specific
   health implications of the `working poor' status. The proportion of
   `working poor' is increasing in Germany. Poverty-related health problems
   occur because of a lower standard of nutrition and housing, financial
   restraints, bad labour conditions, high-risk behaviours, and lack of
   access to health services. Impaired health status, in turn, adversely
   affects incomes and wages, raising concern about a vicious circle.
   Limited health-care resources demand preventive policies to improve
   employment status and income. Health and economic policy demand specific
   research on the health implications of precarious employment. In some
   areas, swift action is required. Journal of Public Health Policy (2010)

Abstract = {{To identify biological pathways associated with myocardial recovery from
   heart failure (HF), gene profiling and gene set enrichment analysis
   (GSEA) were examined in left ventricle of spontaneously hypertensive
   rats with HF (SHR-F) with no treatment, following treatment with the
   angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and treatment with
   captopril combined with the short chain fatty acid derivative
   phenylbutyrate. Failing hearts demonstrated depressed left ventricular
   ejection fraction, while ventricular volume and mass increased.
   Captopril treatment alone prevented further deterioration but did not
   improve myocardial function; relatively few transcripts were
   differentially expressed relative to untreated SHR-F. Gene sets
   identified by GSEA as downregulated with captopril treatment compared to
   SHR-F group included those related to hypoxia and reactive oxygen
   species, while upregulated gene sets included G protein signaling.
   Treatment with phenylbutyrate alone did not improve survival (no animals
   in this group survived the 30 day treatment period), while
   phenylbutyrate combined with captopril increased survival and
   significantly improved cardiac function in vivo and in vitro. Normalized
   microarray data identified 780 genes that demonstrated a combined
   treatment effect of which 258 genes were modified with HF. Fatty acid
   metabolism and ion transport were among the most significantly
   upregulated pathways in the combined treatment group compared to
   untreated SHR with HF, whereas those related to oxidative stress,
   growth, inflammation, protein degradation, and TGF-beta signaling were
   downregulated. These findings demonstrate improved myocardial function
   and regression of cardiac hypertrophy, and identify many HF related gene
   sets altered with phenylbutyrate and captopril treatment, but not
   captopril alone. These results characterize gene sets associated with
   recovery from HF, and suggest that phenylbutyrate may be a potentially
   effective adjunctive treatment, together with captopril, by
   synergistically modulating pathways that contribute to restoration of
   contractile function of the failing SHR heart. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective. Hantavirus infections are emerging infections that cause
   either Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome or haemorrhagic fever with renal
   syndrome (HFRS). A recent Swedish outbreak of nephropathia epidemica, a
   European HFRS, was analysed to study the patient flow and clinical
   picture and to investigate the value of an early diagnosis in general
   practice. Design. In a retrospective design, medical records of verified
   cases of Hantavirus infection were studied. Setting. The study was
   conducted in the county of Norrbotten, Sweden. Subjects. Data from
   Hantavirus patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2008 were analysed. Main
   outcome measures. Demographic data, level of care, treatment, clinical
   symptoms, and laboratory findings were obtained. Results. In total, 456
   cases were included (58\% males and 42\% females). The majority of
   patients first saw their general practitioner and were exclusively
   treated in general practice (83\% and 56\%, respectively). When
   diagnosed correctly at the first visit, antibiotics and hospitalization
   were significantly lowered compared with delayed diagnosis (14\% vs.
   53\% and 30\% vs. 54\%, respectively; p < 0.0001). The clinical picture
   was diverse. Early thrombocytopenia was found in 65\% of the patients,
   and haemorrhagic manifestations were documented in a few cases. Signs of
   renal involvement - haematuria, proteinuria, and raised levels of serum
   creatinine - were found in a majority of patients. Conclusions. Raised
   awareness in general practice regarding emerging infections and better
   diagnostic tools are desirable. This study of a Hantavirus outbreak
   shows that general practitioners are frontline doctors during outbreaks
   and through early and correct diagnosis they can reduce antibiotic
   treatment and hospitalization.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The corpus callosum (CC) is frequently compromised in
   patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Structural and functional
   measurements of the CC may be useful to monitor the progression of the
   disease. The aim of this pilot study was to determine if bimanual
   tactile temporal thresholds correlates with CC volume. A tactile
   temporal threshold is the longest temporal interval that separates the
   onsets of two tactile stimuli when they are judged by the observer as
   simultaneous. Judgments to bimanual stimulations require
   interhemispheric transfer via the CC. Methods: Thresholds were examined
   in MS patients and matched controls. Magnetic resonance (MR) images were
   acquired on a 3T MR system within 48 hours of clinical assessment and
   measurement of thresholds. Results: Corpus callosum volume was assessed
   by using a semiautomatic livewire algorithm. The CC volume was smaller
   (by 21\% on average, p<0.01) and thresholds were higher (by 49\% on
   average, p<0.03) in MS patients when compared to controls. A significant
   correlation (r = -0.66, p = 0.01) between CC volume and thresholds
   emerged for the MS patients. Conclusion: Measuring treatment benefits of
   neuroprotective and repair therapies is a well recognized challenge in
   MS research. The overall findings of this study suggest that these
   measurements, which involve the transfer of information
   interhemispherically via the CC, may be promising outcome measures that
   warrant further scientific exploration to develop a model to measure
   recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Decision-making in healthcare is a priority-setting process. Tools used
   in health economic evaluation support decision-making by outlining
   complex interdependences, simulating short- and long-term consequences,
   and quantifying formal comparisons of health technologies. Key elements
   in health economic evaluations are patient-relevant outcomes and cost
   parameters. Costing of healthcare services is demanding and reflects
   only an approximation to reality, particularly in Germany, as the
   reimbursement schemes neither fully provide all details nor the
   different costing perspectives. Hence, in order to obtain uniform and
   cross-indication applicable cost parameters, a German standard cost
   dataset is necessary. In addition, patient-relevant and
   indication-specific sets of outcomes parameters should be agreed upon in
   order to also enable a reliable clinical product development. Economic
   aspects could be applied in a two-step decision-making approach, where
   initially the anticipated indication-specific technical efficiency level
   in terms of cost per adjusted life years would be assessed from a health
   system perspective. The second step would employ prioritization based on
   indication-relevant outcomes and ranking criteria in the individual
   patient decision situation. Health economic evaluations are relevant
   tools to support prioritization of health technologies, both on an
   individual as well as public health level.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Best practices for peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter
   insertion call for timely placement of catheters to reduce complications
   and increase the likelihood of a successful initiation of PD. The
   purpose of our study was to assess if a change in approach to PD
   catheter insertion, including a switch to radiological insertion of PD
   catheters and introduction of a dialysis access nurse to coordinate all
   patient care, was associated with more outpatient procedures and
   achievement of guideline-based outcomes, including timelier PD starts.
   Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective chart review of all
   patients that had their first PD catheter inserted at our center over a
   7-year period ending in 2007.
   Results: PD catheters were placed in 88 patients by interventional
   radiology and in 125 patients by surgical insertion during an earlier
   period. Insertion of PD catheters by interventional radiology was
   significantly associated with a higher rate of outpatient procedures
   (70\% vs 32\%, p < 0.0001) than surgical placement. At PD start, 82\% of
   patients that underwent radiological insertions had an estimated
   glomerular filtration rate of over 8 mL/minute/1.73 m(2) and their mean
   serum albumin level was 38.2 g/L.
   Conclusions: The new procedure of radiological insertion of PD
   catheters, coordinated by a dedicated dialysis access nurse, was
   associated with more outpatient procedures than the earlier surgical
   method and allowed patients to receive a PD catheter with timing
   consistent with clinical practice recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to assess vasomotor and other
   menopausal symptoms before starting estrogens or placebo, 1 year later,
   again at trial closure, and after stopping estrogens or placebo. The
   role of baseline symptoms and age was examined, as was the frequency and
   determinants of hormone use and symptom management strategies after
   discontinuing conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) or placebo.
   Methods: Intent-to-treat analyses of 10,739 postmenopausal women before
   and 1 year after randomization to CEE or placebo at 40 clinical centers
   and a cohort analysis of participants (n = 3,496) who continued taking
   assigned study pills up to trial closure and completed symptom surveys
   shortly before (mean, 7.4 +/- 1.1 y from baseline) and after (mean, 306
   +/- 55 d after trial closure) stopping pills were performed. Generalized
   linear regression modeled vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, breast
   tenderness, pain/stiffness, and mood swings as a function of treatment
   assignment and baseline symptoms, before and after stopping study pills.
   Results: Approximately one third of participants reported at least one
   moderate to severe symptom at baseline. Fewer symptoms were reported
   with increasing age, except joint pain/stiffness, which was similar
   among age groups. At 1 year, hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal
   dryness were reduced by CEE, whereas breast tenderness was increased.
   Breast tenderness was also significantly higher in the CEE group at
   trial closure. After stopping, vasomotor symptoms were reported by
   significantly more women who had reported symptoms at baseline, compared
   with those who had not, and by significantly more participants assigned
   to CEE (9.8\%) versus placebo (3.2\%); however, among women with no
   moderate or severe symptoms at baseline, more than five times as many
   reported hot flashes after stopping CEE (7.2\%) versus placebo (1.5\%).
   Conclusions: CEE significantly reduced vasomotor symptoms and vaginal
   dryness in women with baseline symptoms but increased breast tenderness.
   The likelihood of experiencing symptoms was significantly higher after
   stopping CEE than placebo regardless of baseline symptom status. These
   potential effects should be considered before initiating CEE to relieve
   menopausal symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this article is to introduce and discuss a theoretical
   approach to an ongoing text production analysis of satirical sketch
   comedy on Danish public service television. The aim is to shed some
   light on the change in what I term the professional ideology of this
   specific field of production, and to understand the driving forces in
   its development. The theoretical approach suggested will address recent
   developments in the growing field of media production analysis relevant
   to this aim, and argue for an approach derived from socio-cognitive
   reception theory in the study. A socio-cognitive understanding of genre
   elaborates the concept `horizon of expectation' derived from
   hermeneutics of texts used in pragmatic genre theory and links it to
   social and cognitive psychology. By so doing, it functions as a sort of
   `missing link' between the humanities and the social sciences. On the
   basis of empirical results from the first part of the study, on
   professional ideology, the article argues that this enhanced
   genre-sensitive approach is useful in production analysis. Its utility
   also derives from its methodological advantages.}},

Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{Reforestation of ex-arable land in temperate regions increases the area
   of potential habitat for forest plants. However, the herbaceous plant
   layer of these plantations contains fewer forest species than comparable
   plantations at continuously forested sites. One of the reasons for this
   might be differences in recruitment. The present study addresses
   post-dispersal seed predation, mainly of woody plants, as the factor
   limiting the recolonization of young oak plantations in southern Sweden.
   Our objectives were to investigate differences in dispersal and
   post-dispersal seed predation between first-generation forest
   plantations on ex-arable land and re-planted clear-cuts on continuously
   forested land. There was no recruitment following the experimental
   sowing of six common woody species (Abuts glutinosa, Betula pendula,
   Frangula alnus, Sambucus nigra, Sorbus aucuparia and Sorbus intermedia).
   Thus, the colonization of forest plantations by native shrubs and trees
   appears to be habitat-limited; the only exception being Rhamnus
   catharticus, for which poor dispersal ability may be more important.
   Post-dispersal seed predation of forest shrubs and trees was marked,
   especially in relatively small and isolated plantations on ex-arable
   land. There was a high seed predation of Crataegus monogyna, Sorbus
   aucuparia and Viburnum opulus on ex-arable land, while that of Frangula
   alnus and Sambucus racemosa was not associated with site placement and
   land-use history. Seed predation is probably a more important factor
   limiting restoration of near-natural forests than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Amelogenins are the dominant proteins present in ameloblasts during the
   early stages of enamel biomineralization, making up >90\% of the matrix
   protein. Along with the full-length protein there are several
   splice-variant isoforms of amelogenin present including LRAP
   (Leucine-Rich Amelogenin Protein), a protein that consists of the first
   33 and the last 26 residues of full-length amelogenin. Using
   solution-state NMR spectroscopy we have assigned the H-1-N-15 HSQC
   spectrum of murine LRAP (rp(H)LRAP) in 2\% acetic acid at pH 3.0 by
   making extensive use of previous chemical shift assignments for
   full-length murine amelogenin (rp(H) M180). This correlation was
   possible because LRAP, like the full-length protein, is intrinsically
   disordered under these solution conditions. The major difference between
   the H-1-N-15 HSQC spectra of rp(H)M180 and rp (H)LRAP was an additional
   set of amide resonances for each of the seven non-proline residues
   between S12{*} and Y12 near the N-terminus of rp(H)LRAP indicating that
   the N-terminal region of LRAP exists in two different conformations.
   Analysis of the proline carbon chemical shifts suggests that the
   molecular basis for the two states is not a cis-trans isomerization of
   one or more of the proline residues in the N-terminal region. Starting
   from 2\% acetic acid, where rp(H)LRAP was monomeric in solution, NaCl
   addition effected residue specific changes in molecular dynamics
   manifested by the reduction in intensity and disappearance of H-1-N-15
   HSQC cross peaks. As observed for the full-length protein, these
   perturbations may signal early events governing supramolecular
   self-assembly of rp(H)LRAP into nanospheres. However, the different
   patterns of H-1-N-15 HSQC cross peak perturbation between rp(H)LRAP and
   rp(H)M180 in high salt suggest that the termini may behave differently
   in their respective nanospheres, and perhaps, these differences
   contribute to the cell signaling properties attributable to LRAP but not
   to the full-length protein. (C) 2010 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of the autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis
   (MS) requires therapies that both limit and repair damage. While several
   immunomodulatory treatments exist to limit damage there are currently no
   treatments that promote the regenerative process of remyelination. A
   rapid way of screening potential pro-remyelination compounds is
   therefore required. The use of larval zebrafish in a drug reprofiling
   screen allows rapid in vivo screening and has been used successfully in
   the past as an efficient way of identifying new indications for existing
   drugs. A novel screening platform for potential pro-myelination
   compounds was developed using zebrafish larvae. Two percent of compounds
   screened from reprofiling libraries altered oligodendrocyte lineage cell
   recruitment and/or proliferation, as measured by the numbers of dorsally
   migrated spinal cord olig2(+) cells. Selective screening identified
   three compounds that altered levels of myelination, as measured by whole
   larvae myelin basic protein (mbp) transcript levels; the src family
   kinase inhibitor PP2, a biogenic amine and a thioxanthene. As well as
   many previously unrecognised compounds, identified compounds included
   those with previously known effects on myelin and/or the oligodendrocyte
   lineage, such as a PPAR agonist, steroid hormones and src family kinase
   inhibitors. As well as providing methods for further assessment of
   potentially beneficial compounds, this screen has highlighted 25 targets
   that are able to alter oligodendrocyte lineage cell recruitment or
   proliferation and/or mbp transcript levels in vivo and are worthy of
   further investigation for their potential effects on remyelination. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the distribution of error types across subgroups
   of primary progressive aphasia and poststroke aphasia in different
   vascular locations. Method: We analyzed naming errors in 49 individuals
   with acute left hemisphere ischemic stroke and 55 individuals with three
   variants of primary progressive aphasia. Location of atrophy or ischemic
   stroke was characterized using MRI. Results: We found that distribution
   of error types was very similar across all subgroups, irrespective of
   the site or etiology of the lesion. The only significant difference
   across groups was the percentage of circumlocutions (F(7, 96) = 3.02, p
   = .005). Circumlocution errors were highest among logopenic variant PPA
   (24\%) and semantic variant PPA (24\%). Semantic coordinate errors were
   common in all groups, probably because they can arise from disruption of
   different cognitive processes underlying naming and, therefore, from
   different locations of brain damage. Conclusions: Semantic errors are
   common among all types of primary progressive aphasia and poststroke
   aphasia, and the type of error depends in part on the location of
   damage.}},

Abstract = {{Many organizations recognize that their employees, who are often
   considered the weakest link in information security, can also be great
   assets in the effort to reduce risk related to information security.
   Since employees who comply with the information security rules and
   regulations of the organization are the key to strengthening information
   security, understanding compliance behavior is crucial for organizations
   that want to leverage their human capital.
   This research identifies the antecedents of employee compliance with the
   information security policy (ISP) of an organization. Specifically, we
   investigate the rationality-based factors that drive an employee to
   comply with requirements of the ISP with regard to protecting the
   organization's information and technology resources. Drawing on the
   theory of planned behavior, we posit that, along with normative belief
   and self-efficacy, an employee's attitude toward compliance determines
   intention to comply with the ISP. As a key contribution, we posit that
   an employee's attitude is influenced by benefit of compliance, cost of
   compliance, and cost of noncompliance, which are beliefs about the
   overall assessment of consequences of compliance or noncompliance. We
   then postulate that these beliefs are shaped by the employee's outcome
   beliefs concerning the events that follow compliance or noncompliance:
   benefit of compliance is shaped by intrinsic benefit, safety of
   resources, and rewards, while cost of compliance is shaped by work
   impediment; and cost of noncompliance is shaped by intrinsic cost,
   vulnerability of resources, and sanctions. We also investigate the
   impact of information security awareness (ISA) on outcome beliefs and an
   employee's attitude toward compliance with the ISP.
   Our results show that an employee's intention to comply with the ISP is
   significantly influenced by attitude, normative beliefs, and
   self-efficacy to comply. Outcome beliefs significantly affect beliefs
   about overall assessment of consequences, and they, in turn,
   significantly affect an employee's attitude. Furthermore, ISA positively
   affects both attitude and outcome beliefs. As the importance of
   employees' following their organizations' information security rules and
   regulations increases, our study sheds light on the role of ISA and
   compliance-related beliefs in an organization's efforts to encourage
   compliance.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Penile cancer, although statistically rare in Western
   countries (1: 100 000 per year), results in considerable physical and
   psychological morbidity. The treatment of choice for penile cancer is
   either partial or total amputation of the penis. Metastatic spread into
   the surrounding lymphatic system may require additional surgery. To
   date, little is known of the lived experiences of men with penile cancer
   regarding the impact of the disease and its treatment on dimensions of
   masculinity.
   Methods: A small-scale qualitative study using Interpretative
   Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). IPA aims at exploring the experience of
   life events and the meaning and implications for the person living
   through them. A purposive sample of men with penile cancer who were
   within a minimum of 18 months post-surgery were recruited via a
   specialist urology clinic (n = 9). Participants were interviewed by a
   male researcher using a pre-agreed semi-structured interview schedule;
   interviews were audio recorded for transcription with detailed analyses
   of main and sub-themes conducted independently by three researchers. To
   maintain analytical rigour, constant comparisons of main and sub-themes
   were made between the individual transcripts and across the emergent
   themes within the research group.
   Results: Central themes were (1) grappling with reality; (2) learning to
   cope and (3) changes to self.
   Conclusions: That men should have an altered sense of masculine identity
   following penile cancer surgery is not unexpected. However, the ways in
   which altered masculinity manifested itself were both subtle and
   insidious. The results have implications for clinical practice and
   demonstrated the need for further research. Copyright (C) 2009 John

Abstract = {{The beta-isoform of PIP4K (PtdIns5P-4-kinase) regulates the levels of
   nuclear PtdIns5P, which in turn modulates the acetylation of the tumour
   suppressor p53. The crystal structure of PIP4K beta demonstrated that it
   can form a homodimer with the two subunits arranged in opposite
   orientations. Using MS, isoform-specific antibodies against PIP4Ks, RNAi
   (RNA interference) suppression and overexpression studies, we show that
   PIP4K beta interacts in vitro and in vivo with the P1P4K alpha isoform.
   As the two isoforrns phosphorylate the same substrate to generate the
   same product, the interaction could be considered to be functionally
   redundant. However, contrary to expectation, we find that PIP4K beta has
   2000-fold less activity towards PtdIns5P compared with PIP4K alpha, and
   that the majority of PIP4K activity associated with P1P4K beta comes
   from its interaction with PIP4K alpha. Furthermore, PIP4K beta can
   modulate the nuclear localization of PIP4K alpha, and PIP4K alpha has a
   role in regulating PIP4K beta functions. The results of the present
   study suggest a rationale for the functional interaction between PIP4K
   alpha and PIP4K beta and provide insight into how the relative levels of
   the two enzymes may be important in their physiological and pathological
   roles.}},

Abstract = {{Absorbance changes Delta A (810) were measured in pea (Pisum sativum L.,

   preillumination conditions in the absence and presence of inhibitors and
   protonophorous uncoupler of photosynthetic electron transport. It was
   shown that cyclic electron transport (CET) in chloroplasts of pea leaves
   operates at its highest rate after preillumination of leaves with white
   light and is strongly suppressed after preillumination with FR light.
   The FR light-induced suppression was partly released during prolonged
   dark adaptation. Upon FR illumination of dark-adapted leaves, the
   induction of CET was observed, during which CET activity increased to
   the peak from the low level and then decreased gradually. The kinetics
   of P700 oxidation induced by FR light of various intensities in leaves
   preilluminated with white light were fit to empirical sigmoid curves
   containing two variables. In leaves treated with a protonophore FCCP,
   the amplitude of FR light-induced changes Delta A (810) was strongly
   suppressed, indicating that the rate of CET is controlled by the pH

Abstract = {{Objective : The objective of the present study was to investigate the
   effects of one-year treatment with exenatide or Insulin Glargine,
   followed by a 5-week off-drug period, on postprandial lipidaemia,
   glycaemia and measures of oxidative stress.
   Methods : Sixty-nine metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes
   were randomised (using apermuted block randomisation scheme stratified
   by site and baseline HbA1c stratum (=8.5\% or >8.5\%) of which 60
   completed (exenatide n=30; Insulin Glargine n=30) the pre-treatment and
   on-drug meal test. Postprandial glucose, lipids and lipoproteins, and
   oxidative stress markers were studied at week -1, 51, and after a 5-week
   off-drug period following a breakfast and lunch mixed-meal containing
   50g fat, 75g carbohydrates, and 35g protein.
   Results : 51-Week exenatide treatment resulted in a significant
   reduction of prandial glucose, triglycerides, apo-B48, calculated
   VLDL-C, FFA and MDA excursions whereas Insulin Glargine predominantly
   reduced fasting glucose, FFA and MDA. Changes in markers of oxidative
   stress were related to changes in postprandial glucose and triglyceride
   excursions, independent of treatment arm. All postprandial measures
   returned to pre-treatment values in both groups after 5-week cessation
   of study treatment.
   Conclusion : Exenatide showed beneficial effects on postprandial
   glycaemia and lipidaemia, and these effects were related to changes in
   the oxidative stress markers MDA and oxLDL during one year of treatment
   as compared to Insulin Glargine. Following cessation of both exenatide
   and Insulin Glargine measures returned to pre-treatment values,
   suggesting that ongoing treatment is necessary to maintain the
   beneficial effects of either therapy. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although dam removal has been increasingly used as an option in dam
   management and as a river restoration tool, there are few studies
   providing detailed quantitative assessment of the response of fish
   populations to dam removal. In this study, we document the response of
   the fish community in the Pine River, Michigan, to the gradual removal
   of Stronach Dam. Ten sites were sampled annually during the course of
   the removal (1997-2003) and for 4 years following removal (2004-2007).
   Before the removal of Stronach Dam, 11 fish species were found only
   downstream of the dam, 1 species was found only upstream of the dam, and
   19 species were captured both above and below the dam. Following
   removal, 8 species formerly found only below the dam utilized newly
   available portions of the river above the dam. Most fish species (18 of
   the 25 evaluated) showed an increase in abundance following removal,
   strongly supporting the idea that dam removal reduces multiple factors
   limiting riverine fishes. Brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout
   Oncorhynchus mykiss were the primary sport fishes present in the river,
   and the abundance of both species increased by more than twofold over
   the course of the study. The abundance of white suckers Catostomus
   commersonii also increased significantly due to increased reproductive
   success. The results of this study illustrate how dam removal is a
   useful tool for restoration of habitat connectivity and habitat
   conditions and how the fish community in a coldwater stream responded to
   the removal.}},

Abstract = {{Solid bitumen, H2S, pyrite and anhydrite samples from the Lower Triassic
   Feixianguan Formation and Upper Permian Changxing Formation, and source
   rock kerogen samples from the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian and Permian
   in the East Sichuan Basin were analyzed for their sulfur content and
   delta S-34 values, to determine if the measurements were consistent with
   a thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) origin of the produced H2S and
   solid bitumen. The results show that the solid bitumen samples have
   sulfur contents from 2 6 to 12.5 wt.\% and delta S-34 values from +13.4
   parts per thousand to +22.1 parts per thousand The delta S-34 values are
   significantly heavier than those of potential Upper Permian source rock
   kerogens that average +1.3 parts per thousand (n = 3). suggesting that
   most of the sulfur in the solid bitumen is derived from isotopically
   heavy H2S of TSR origin (from +12.0 parts per thousand to +13.7 parts
   per thousand). Interestingly, two gases produced from gas to water
   transition zones during drill stem testing (DST) show significantly
   lighter delta S-34 values (+3 3 parts per thousand and +4 1 parts per
   thousand) than the H2S from gas-producing intervals. The isotopically
   light H2S may be genetically linked to fracture-filling isotopically
   heavy anhydrite with delta S-34 values from +38.5 parts per thousand to
   +39.6 parts per thousand which are significantly heavier than those of
   coeval seawater sulfate (+11 8 parts per thousand to +21 7 parts per
   thousand) as measured for bedded anhydrite. The link may have resulted
   from reduction of part of the dissolved sulfate by hydrocarbons under
   sulfate-limited conditions. Source rock kerogens show a secular change
   in delta S-34 values relative to source rock age A dramatic decrease and
   then increase in delta S-34(kerogen) was found toward the
   Permian/Triassic boundary for the first time in the East Sichuan Basin.

Abstract = {{Hitherto, it has not been easy to interpret the meaning of the amount of
   discrimination information conveyed in a term rationally and explicitly
   within practical application contexts; it has not been simple to
   introduce the concept of the extent of semantic relatedness between two
   terms meaningfully and successfully into scientific discussions. This
   study is part of an attempt to do this. We attempt to answer two
   important questions: 1) What is the discrimination information conveyed
   by a term and how to measure it? 2) What is the relatedness between two
   terms and how to estimate it? We focus on the first question and present
   an in-depth investigation into the discrimination measures based on
   several information measures, which are widely used in a variety of
   applications. The relatedness measures are then naturally defined
   according to the individual discrimination measures. Some key points are
   made for clarifying potential problems arising from using the
   relatedness measures, and solutions are suggested. Two example
   applications in the contexts of text mining and information retrieval
   are provided. The aim of this study, of which this paper forms part, is
   to establish a unified theoretical framework, with measurement of
   discrimination information (MDI) at the core, for achieving effective
   measurement of semantic relatedness (MSR). Due to its generality, our
   method can be expected to be a useful tool with a wide range of
   application areas.}},

   revealed that Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) doped in silica nanoparticles retained its

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide two generalizations of the CUR matrix
   decomposition Y = CUR (also known as pseudo-skeleton approximation
   method {[}1]) to the case of N-way arrays (tensors). These
   generalizations, which we called Fiber Sampling Tensor Decomposition
   types 1 and 2 (FSTD1 and FSTD2), provide explicit formulas for the
   parameters of a rank-(R, R, ..., R) Tucker representation (the core
   tensor of size R x R x ... x R and the matrix factors of sizes I-n x R,
   n = 1, 2, ... N) based only on some selected entries of the original
   tensor. FSTD1 uses PN-1(P >= R) n-mode fibers of the original tensor
   while FSTD2 uses exactly R fibers in each mode as matrix factors, as
   suggested by the existence theorem provided in Oseledets et al. (2008)
   {[}2], with a core tensor defined in terms of the entries of a subtensor
   of size R x R x ... x R. For N = 2 our results are reduced to the
   already known CUR matrix decomposition where the core matrix is defined
   as the inverse of the intersection submatrix, i.e. U = W-1.
   Additionally, we provide an adaptive type algorithm for the selection of
   proper fibers in the FSTD1 model which is useful for large scale
   applications. Several numerical results are presented showing the
   performance of our FSTD1 Adaptive Algorithm compared to two recently
   proposed approximation methods for 3-way tensors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Coronary stenting is the primary means of coronary
   revascularization. There are two basic techniques of stent implantation:
   stenting with balloon predilatation of stenosis and stenting without
   predilatation (direct stenting). Limiting the time that a fluoroscope is
   activated and by appropriately managing the intensity of the applied
   radiation, the operator limits radiation in the environment, and this
   saves the exposure to the patient and all personnel in the room.
   Nephrotoxicity is one of the most important properties of radiocontrast.
   The smaller amount of radiocontrast used also provides multiple positive
   effects, primarily regarding the periprocedural risk for the patients
   with the reduced renal function. The goal of the study was to compare
   fluoroscopy time, the amount of radiocontrast, and expenses of material
   used in direct stenting and in stenting with predilatation.
   Patients and methods. In a prospective study, 70 patients with coronary
   disease were randomized to direct stenting, or stenting with
   predilatation.
   Results. Fluoroscopy time and radiocontrast use were significantly
   reduced in the directly stented patients in comparison to the patients
   stented with balloon-predilatation. The study showed a significant
   reduction of expenses when using a direct stenting method in comparison
   to stenting with predilatation.
   Conslusions. If the operator predicts that the procedure can be
   performed using direct stenting, he is encouraged to do so. Direct
   stenting is recommended for all percutaneous coronary interventions when
   appropriate conditions have been met. If direct stenting has been
   unsuccessful, the procedure can be converted to predilatation.}},

Abstract = {{Infection by a parasite often induces behavioural changes in the host
   and these changes may benefit either the host or the parasite. However,
   whether these changes are active host defence mechanisms or parasitic
   manipulations or simply incidental byproducts of the infection is not
   always clear. It has been suggested that understanding the proximate
   mechanisms of these changes as well as comparative studies could help
   distinguish these alternatives better. Behavioural fever is a common
   response to an infection in many animals and we investigated the
   phenomenon in the novel host-parasite relationship between the honeybee
   and the temperature-sensitive microsporidian Nosema ceranae. Our results
   show that infected bees prefer higher temperatures and even though this
   seems to benefit the pathogen, the proximate mechanism underlying this
   change is the pathological stress underlying the infection. Especially
   because it is a new host-parasite relationship, it is best to label the
   observed behavioural change as a case of incidental benefit although
   this does not rule out selection acting on it. We discuss the importance
   of looking at the behavioural outcomes of host-parasite relationships
   and the importance of studying them at multiple levels for understanding
   their origin and maintenance.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: There is still no consensus as to the optimal treatment for
   sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease (SPD). Many recommend off-midline
   closure, if any excisional procedure is to be selected.
   METHODS: The authors prospectively studied 145 patients with SPD who
   presented at 3 hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo
   either modified Limberg flap (MLF) transposition (n = 72) or Karydakis
   flap reconstruction (n = 73). Surgical findings, complications,
   recurrence rates, and degree of patient satisfaction, evaluated via a
   standardized telephone interview, were compared.
   RESULTS: Operation time was, longer in the MLF group. There were no
   significant differences between the two groups in terms of complication
   rate, length of stay, or recurrence rate. Patients in the Karydakis
   group reported feeling completely healed more quickly postoperatively.
   The two groups reported similar rates of satisfaction. Mandatory patient
   withdrawal from a given study arm because of the orifice straying from
   the midline occurred more frequently in the Karydakis group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The MLF technique and the Karydakis procedure appear to
   generate comparable outcomes. With laterally situated orifices, however,
   the applicability of the Karydakis method may be limited. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Background. The authors aimed to investigate the effects of montelukast
   (ML) on the experimental rat colon anastomosis. Methods. A total of 80
   Wistar albino rats were divided into 4 groups: sham-operated, colon
   anastomosis, and colon anastomosis with oral administration (OAML) and
   rectal administration of 10 mg/kg/d ML (RAML). Anastomotic bursting
   pressure, anastomotic hydroxyproline contents, malondialdehyde (MDA),
   glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide
   dismutase (SOD) levels, and the expressions of Ki-67, vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor
   (bFGF) with immunohistochemistry were assessed on postoperative day 5.
   Results. Anastomotic bursting pressures and bFGF expressions were not
   changed, whereas tissue hydroxyproline concentrations and MDA levels and
   the expressions of Ki-67 and VEGF were significantly decreased, and GSH,
   GPX, and SOD levels were significantly increased in the OAML and RAML

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the possible anatomical
   risk factors of coronary heart disease (CHD) such as vascular geometry
   of the left coronary artery and its branches using coronary angiography.
   Patients and Methods: The trunk length (T) of the left coronary artery,
   the curve angle of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the
   bifurcation angle between the LAD and the circumflex artery (Cx) were
   measured in 77 patients (age range 20-83, mean 58.9+/-11.68).
   Results: The atherosclerotic plaque existence was investigated in LAD
   and Cx. The mean values of the T length, LAD curve angle and the LAD-Cx
   bifurcation angle were respectively 12.86 mm, 140.99 degrees and 94.07
   degrees. In patients who have atherosclerotic plaques in LAD, the mean
   value of the T lengths was found 2.5 mm shorter than those of the
   patients whose LADs are intact (p=0.020). On the other hand a
   significant negative correlation between the LAD curve angle and the
   bifurcation angle was found (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: In view of our results it can be suggested that geometrical
   pattern of LAD and its branches may be a congenital risk factor in
   development of CHD in patients who have no other risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{In bivalve molluscs, responses to bacterial infection have been largely
   characterized in terms of both functional responses and gene expression
   in the immune cells, the hemocytes. The effects of bacterial challenge
   at the tissue level, where bacterial infection may cause stressful
   conditions, have not been so far specifically investigated. Biomarkers
   are widely utilised to evaluate the health status of bivalves, from the
   molecular to the organism level, in response to both natural and
   anthropogenic stressors. In this work, the effects of in vivo challenge
   with heat-killed vibrio species, Vibrio splendidus LGP32 and Vibrio
   anguillarum (ATCC19264), on different biomarkers in the digestive gland
   of the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis were investigated.
   Mussels were injected with either vibrio and tissues sampled at 3, 6 and
   24 h post injection (p.i.). Lysosomal biomarkers, such as lysosomal
   membrane stability (LMS) and lipofuscin accumulation, as well as
   specific activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and glutathione
   transferase-GST) were evaluated. Moreover, the expression of antioxidant
   molecules (catalase, GST-n and metallothioneins MT10 and MT20) was
   determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Both V. splendidus and V. anguillarum
   significantly affected all parameters measured, to a different extent
   and at different times p.i. Interestingly, whereas both vibrios induced
   lysosomal membrane destabilisation and increases in the activities of
   antioxidant enzymes, distinct responses were observed in terms of
   lysosomal lipofuscin accumulation and expression of antioxidant
   molecules. In particular, V. splendidus induced a general increase in
   the transcription of antioxidant genes, indicating that Mytilus
   digestive gland can mount an efficient antioxidant response towards this
   vibrio species. On the other hand, a general down-regulation or no
   effect was observed with V. anguillarum. The lack of this response was
   reflected in stronger oxidative stress conditions in the digestive gland
   of mussels challenged with V. anguillarum, as indicated by higher levels
   of lysosomal lipofuscin observed at longer times p.i. Overall, these
   data indicate that lysosomal and oxidative stress biomarkers could be
   usefully applied in order to monitor early changes in the health status
   of bivalves induced by bacteria. Moreover, the results support the
   hypothesis that host responses to bacteria may be taken into account
   when interpreting biomarker data in ecotoxicological studies. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Microglial cells constitutively express Notch-1 and nuclear factor-kappa
   B/p65 (NF-kappa B/p65), and both pathways modulate production of
   inflammatory mediators. This study sought to determine whether a
   functional relationship exists between them and, if so, to investigate
   whether they synergistically regulate common microglial cell functions.
   By immunofluorescence labeling, real-time polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR), flow cytometry, and Western blot, BV-2 cells exhibited Notch-1
   and NF-kappa B/p65 expression, which was significantly up-regulated in
   cells challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This was coupled with an
   increase in expression of Hes-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). In BV-2 cells
   pretreated with N-{[}N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-1-alanyl]-S-phenyglycine
   t-butyl ester (DAFT), a gamma-secretase inhibitor, followed by LPS
   stimulation, Notch-1 expression level was enhanced but that of all other
   markers was suppressed. Additionally, Hes-1 expression and NE-kappa B
   nuclear translocation decreased as shown by flow cytometry. Notch-1's
   modulation of NF-kappa B/p65 was also evidenced in amoeboid microglial
   cells (AMC) in vivo. In 5-day-old rats given intraperitoneal injections
   of LPS, Notch-1, NF-kappa B/p65, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta
   immunofluorescence in AMC was markedly enhanced. However, in rats given
   an intraperitoneal injection of DAFT prior to LPS, Notch-1 labeling was
   augmented, but that of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta was reduced. The results
   suggest that blocking of Notch-1 activation with DAFT would reduce the
   level of its downstream end product Hes-1 along with suppression of
   NF-kappa B/p65 translocation, resulting in suppressed production of
   proinflammatory cytokines. It is concluded that Notch-1 signaling can
   trans-activate NF-kappa B/p65 by amplifying NF-kappa B/p65-dependent
   proinflammatory functions in activated microglia. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{This paper studies policy changes in capital taxation by focusing on
   policy interdependence induced by network dynamics at the international
   level. The empirical findings indicate that the competition mechanism
   induced by network position similarity in the network of portfolio
   investment and that of exports causes policy diffusion in corporate
   taxation; the socialization mechanism (policy learning and emulation)
   induced by network position proximity in the IGO networks also drives
   policy changes, and the evidence is much stronger in the IGO networks
   that facilitate policy learning than in those that facilitate emulation.
   The paper also discusses explicitly empirical challenges to incorporate
   network characteristics into connectivity matrices in spatial lag models
   often used to study policy diffusion. It suggests that students of
   policy diffusion should discuss as explicitly as possible the
   assumptions and procedures to construct connectivity matrices and
   present results from alternative specifications: our conclusion on the
   strength of policy diffusion is often sensitive to the choice of
   connectivity matrices.}},

Abstract = {{The amounts and composition of saliva produced in parotid glands can be
   influenced by dietary biologically active substances. Among phenolic
   compounds naturally present in some feedstuffs, particularly condensed
   tannins and hydrolysable tannins and derivates appear to play a role for
   the induction of Proline Rich Protein secretion in the parotid saliva of
   some animal species: this might be considered as a first evolutionary
   defence mechanism against the protein precipitating activity of tannins,
   preferably bond to proline and histatins in saliva. This is the first
   paper to report the preliminary results on the effects of full ripe
   acorns (Q pubescens) polyphenols measured as Tannic Acid Equivalents on
   the parotid gland of growing pigs. A total of 8 growing pigs were
   divided into 2 experimental groups (each n = 4): the control group was
   fed a conventional complete diet for pigs (pelleted; 890 g DM/kg; based
   on cereals and soybean extraction meal). The acorn-fed group was offered
   a combined diet, 70\% of ripe whole acorns shred (612 g DM/kg of fresh
   matter, 0.516 g TAE/kg DM) and 30\% of the complete diet. One additional
   pig was fed the experimental diet for 24 h only. All 8 animals from the
   2 experimental groups were sacrificed at 1 week after consumption, the
   additional pig, 24 h after consumption. Both parotid glands of each pig
   were removed and weighed. Maximum length and width were measured and the
   right parotids were used in toto to determine dry matter, crude protein
   and total proline content. Each left parotid gland was processed for
   microscopic check. Increased size (+53.8\% length; +19.9\% width), mass
   (+68.5\% fresh weight) and proline content (+33.8\% based on DM) were
   observed in animals fed the 70\% acorns diet after 7 days. These results
   inspire to perform further investigations on the rapid adaption of pigs
   to counteract the effects of tannins in whole acorns as found after only
   one day of exposure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Amaranth bars enriched with fructans: acceptability and nutritional
   value. There is an increasing appeal for convenience foods with
   potential health benefits to the consumer. Raw materials with high
   nutritional value and functional properties must be used on the
   development of these food products. Amaranth is a gluten-free grain with
   high nutrition value. Inulin and oligofructose are prebiotic ingredients
   presenting effects as the enhancement of calcium absorption. Amaranth
   bars enriched with inulin and oligofructose were developed in the
   flavors: banana, Brazilian nuts and dried grape, coconut, peach,
   strawberry and wall nut. The proximate composition were determined and
   compared to commercial cereal bars, available in traditional (n=59),
   light (n=60), diet (n=8), with soy (n=10) and quinoa (n=1) categories.
   Amaranth bars present mean global acceptance values from 6.3 to 7.6 on a
   9-point hedonic scale, nutritional advantages as compared to commercial
   cereal bars (caloric reduction and higher levels of dietary fiber).
   Although amaranth is an unknown raw material in Brazil, it shows good
   potential to be used in the manufacturing of ready-to-eat products. As
   they are gluten free, these amaranth bars are also an alternative
   product for celiacs, also contributing to the enhancement of calcium
   absorption, a problem frequently observed in these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulation of phosphate and ammonia in estuarine systems and
   subsequent dinoflagellate and algal blooms has been implicated in fish
   kills and in health risks for fishermen. Analytic chemistry kits are
   used to measure phosphate and ammonia levels in water samples, but their
   sensitivity is limited due to specificity for inorganic forms of these
   moieties. An Escherichia coli bioluminescent reporter system measured
   the bioavailability of inorganic nutrients through fusion of E. coli
   promoters (phoA or glnAp2) to the luxCDABE operon of Vibrio fischeri
   carried either on the chromosome or on a multicopy plasmid vector,
   resulting in emission of light in response to phosphate or ammonia
   starvation. Responses were shown to be under the control of expected
   physiological regulators, phoB and glnFG, respectively. Standard curves
   were used to determine the phosphate and ammonia levels in water samples
   from diverse watersheds located in the northeastern United States.
   Bioluminescence produced in response to nutrient starvation correlated
   with concentrations of phosphate (1-24 ppm) and ammonia (0.1-1.6 ppm).
   While the ammonia biosensor measured nutrient concentrations in tested
   water samples that were comparable to the amounts reported by a
   commercial kit, the phosphate biosensor reported higher levels of
   phosphate in Chesapeake water samples than did the kit.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we demonstrate a new form of immunoregulation: engagement
   on CD4(+) T cells of the complement regulator CD46 promoted the effector
   potential of T helper type 1 cells (T(H)1 cells), but as interleukin 2
   (IL-2) accumulated, it switched cells toward a regulatory phenotype,
   attenuating IL-2 production via the transcriptional regulator ICER/CREM
   and upregulating IL-10 after interaction of the CD46 tail with the
   serine-threonine kinase SPAK. Activated CD4(+) T cells produced CD46
   ligands, and blocking CD46 inhibited IL-10 production. Furthermore,
   CD4(+) T cells in rheumatoid arthritis failed to switch, consequently
   producing excessive interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Finally, gamma delta T
   cells, which rarely produce IL-10, expressed an alternative CD46 isoform
   and were unable to switch. Nonetheless, coengagement of T cell antigen
   receptor (TCR) gamma delta and CD46 suppressed effector cytokine
   production, establishing that CD46 uses distinct mechanisms to regulate
   different T cell subsets during an immune response.}},

Abstract = {{The plated thyreophoran or stegosaurian dinosaur Stegosaurus armatus was
   named in 1877 by Marsh for fragmentary remains from the Morrison
   Formation (Upper Jurassic) of Colorado, USA. Subsequent discoveries from
   the same formation in Wyoming and Colorado (USA) have been assigned to
   separate stegosaurian genera and species, but most of these are no
   longer considered valid. More recently, a partial stegosaurian skeleton
   from Wyoming was named Hesperosaurus mjosi. However, the validity of
   this genus has been questioned recently, raising the question: how much
   osteological difference among stegosaur taxa is needed to separate
   genera from species? The question is examined vis-A -vis species and
   genus recognition in other dinosaurs, including iguanodonts,
   lambeosaurine iguanodontids, chasmosaurine ceratopsians, tyrannosaurid
   theropods, and diplodocid sauropods. The basis for taxonomic distinction
   is largely philosophical: if the species are morphologically distinct
   enough, they should be treated as separate genera. Based on these
   criteria, Hesperosaurus mjosi is a distinct taxon.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the growth response of 25 yr old Lebanon cedar
   (Cedrus libani A. Rich.) plantation to thinnings of different
   intensities in Isparta in western Turkey The thinning intensity was
   measured by using the residual basal area (\%) as parameter In spring of
   2005, three treatments were tested; light, moderate and heavy thinning
   with respectively 10, 25 and 35\% of basal area removed. The statistical
   design of the experiment was a randomized incomplete block with two
   blocks and three treatments. Variables such as diameter at breast height
   (diameter) and height were measured. Growth rate ratios of diameter in
   moderately thinned and heavily thinned stands were 1.02 and 1.03,
   respectively Basal area growth rates in moderately thinned and heavily
   thinned plots were 0.93 and 1.05, respectively The largest values for
   the mean tree were observed with the heaviest thinning treatment.
   Absolute diameter increment was positively correlated with initial
   diameter in all plots. Relative diameter growth was negatively
   correlated with initial diameter Growth rate interpretations were
   supported by analysis of variance using Duncan's test of range multiple.
   The results obtained show significant differences between treatments for
   tree height growth, for the two inventories carried out (2005, 2008).
   However, diameter basal area and volume were no found between treatments

Abstract = {{1. Spatio-temporal distribution and anthropogenic mortality factors were
   investigated in loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) found stranded or
   floating in the waters around Italy. A total of 5938 records for the
   period 1980-2008 were analysed concerning loggerhead turtles measuring
   from 3.8 to 97 cm curved carapace length (mean: 48.3 cm).
   2. Results highlighted the following conservation issues: (i) in the
   study area, anthropogenic mortality is higher than natural mortality;
   (ii) interaction with fisheries is by far the most important
   anthropogenic mortality factor; (iii) longlines are an important
   mortality factor in the southern areas; (iv) trawlers are the cause of
   high numbers of dead strandings in the north Adriatic; (v) entanglement
   in ghost-gear or in other anthropogenic debris affects high numbers of
   turtles; and (vi) boat strikes are an important source of mortality in
   most areas but mostly in the warm seasons.
   3. Results also indicate that: (vii) the north Adriatic is the area with
   the highest turtle density; and (viii) the south Adriatic and to a
   lesser extent the surrounding areas of the north Adriatic and the
   Ionian, are important developmental areas for loggerhead turtles in the
   first years of life.
   4. Italy is in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea and borders major
   foraging areas for the loggerhead turtles in the region, and these
   results confirm previous concerns about the level of anthropogenic
   mortality in Italian waters. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid-propellant rocket engines are capable of on-command variable
   thrust or thrust modulation, an operability advantage that has been
   studied intermittently since the late 1930s. Throttleable
   liquid-propellant rocket engines can be used for planetary entry and
   descent, space rendezvous, orbital maneuvering including orientation and
   stabilization in space, and hovering and hazard avoidance during
   planetary landing. Other applications have included control of aircraft
   rocket engines, limiting of vehicle acceleration or velocity using
   retrograde rockets, and ballistic missile defense trajectory control.
   Throttleable liquid-propellant rocket engines can also continuously
   follow the most economical thrust curve in a given situation, as opposed
   to making discrete throttling changes over a few select operating
   points. The effects of variable thrust on the mechanics and dynamics of
   an liquid-propellant rocket engine as well as difficulties and issues
   surrounding the throttling process are important aspects of throttling
   behavior. This review provides a detailed survey of liquid-propellant
   rocket engine throttling centered around engines from the United States.
   Several liquid-propellant rocket engine throttling methods are
   discussed, including high-pressure-drop systems, dual-injector
   manifolds, gas injection, multiple chambers, pulse modulation, throat
   throttling, movable injector components, and hydrodynamically
   dissipative injectors. Concerns and issues surrounding each method are
   examined, and the advantages and shortcomings compared.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the results of the reprocessing and geological
   reinterpretation of a trio of regional seismic reflection lines acquired
   by the Ministere des Ressources naturelles du Quebec in 1978. The three
   profiles (M-2001, M-2002 and M-2003), which represent 280 km of data,
   cross the Chambly-Fortierville syncline and provide images of the St.
   Lawrence Platform and the Appalachian foreland thrust belt of southern
   Quebec. Profile M-2001, the longest profile, extends across the full
   width of the southern Quebec Appalachians. Post-stack seismic data
   processing has improved the quality of the original seismic sections by
   enhancing coherent reflection events and attenuating reflection noise.
   Time migration further improved the seismic data. The seismic
   interpretations provide new information on subsurface geology, including
   the recognition of complex structural patterns in platform and foreland
   units, the presence of a triangle zone at the structural front, and the
   geometry of thrust slices of platform units and Appalachian thrust
   nappes. The M-2001 line also provides images of the internal Humber
   Zone, including back-thrust faults on the flanks of Notre Dame Mountains
   Anticlinorium and mega thrust wedges, possibly involving Grenvillian
   basement, within the core of the anticlinorium. In southern Quebec, six
   conventional petroleum plays, plus shale gas potential, are recognized
   in the St. Lawrence Platform and Appalachian Foreland. From these, the
   Saint-Flavien field (161 million m(3) of past natural gas production)
   and other potential targets are imaged by the three seismic profiles
   studied. The reprocessing and reinterpretation of these seismic
   reflection profiles provide new insights into the structure, geological
   evolution and petroleum potential of the St. Lawrence Platform and the
   Appalachian foreland thrust belt of southern Quebec.}},

   Nineteen women were studied. Resting anal canal pressure was not
   significantly different before and after delivery (57.1 +/- 13.6 vs 51.1
   +/- 11.9 cmH(2)O, P = 0.1). Squeeze pressure was significantly lower
   postpartum (106.5 +/- 43.6 vs 75.5 +/- 45.6 cmH(2)O, P < 0.001). Fatigue
   rate was significantly reduced postpartum (-129.5 +/- 74.7 vs-76.1 +/-
   54.8 cmH(2)O/min, P = 0.001), but FRI was not significantly altered
   (1.23 +/- 1.49 vs 1.41 +/- 1.27 min, P = 0.09).
   Conclusion
   Maximal squeeze pressure and fatigue rate of the anal canal are
   significantly reduced after childbirth. Resting anal canal pressure and
   FRI are not significantly different.}},

Abstract = {{The present study first time detected D1-D5 dopamine receptor subtypes
   in the native human heart simultaneously, found presence of D1, D2, D4,
   and D5 in cardiac tissues, and revealed distribution features of
   dopamine receptor subtypes in the epicardium, myocardium, and
   endocardium. Samples from four native hearts coming from young
   brain-dead donors, which for technical reason were not used for
   transplants, were studied. Dopamine receptors were revealed by
   immunochemistry technique and immunoblot analysis. Morphometrical
   quantification of the density of each receptor subtype was performed by
   an image analyzer. Our results demonstrate that only four subtypes of
   dopamine receptors can be found in cardiac tissues: D1, D2, D4, and D5.
   These dopamine receptors have been detected in endocardium, myocardium,
   and epicardium. D1 receptors were stored primarily in the epicardial
   layer. Dopamine receptors are distributed in the wall of both atria and
   ventricles, and its transmural gradient can be described in the wall of
   the human heart. Sections of atria and ventricles exposed to
   antidopamine receptor antibodies showed fluorescent-positive reaction in
   the epicardium, myocardium and endocardium. D4 receptor immune
   reactivity was remarkably less intense than D2 receptor immune
   reactivity. All the subtypes of dopamine receptors are in close
   relationships with all cardiac structures. Our findings provide a
   favorable basis for researching the role of dopamine receptors in
   controlling functions of the human heart and in the pathogenesis of
   cardiovascular diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Current environmental and economical circumstances accelerate the
   developments of new concrete constituents. Whereas the process
   technology impacts the mix-design strategy, it seems obvious that
   manufacturing process is prone to evolutions. This article presents a
   method to compare environmental and economical consequences of different
   technological solutions on the basis of the influence on the cement
   consumption needed for a given concrete performance. Case study is the
   choice of dry batch or central mixed concrete production systems for a
   ready mixed concrete production. The theoretical difference in cement
   consumption is estimated by considering that the water content
   fluctuation is by far the dominant factor governing the truck to truck
   variation. The addition of a mixer is effectively found to contribute to
   cement reduction. Environmental comparison is performed using an EADT
   indicator (Environmental Amortization Duration Time) defined in the
   article, and testing various environmental data. The EADT for energy
   consumption, released CO2 and particles are found below 6 years, in the
   whole range attested environmental data for an annual production of
   40,000 m(3) yr(-1), with 2 m(3) mixer for the central mixed concrete
   plant. The NOx and SO2 EADT results are found sensitive to the releases
   of the steel plant. The financial amortization duration time
   corresponding to the purchase of a mixer, is found less than 2 years.
   Although the chosen application case is simplified, these results
   encourage further research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a human-machine system is related to interaction
   between human and machine. The main aim of the indicators used in a
   human machine system is to satisfy the interaction. This paper focuses
   on the design of indicator panel for passenger cars based on the
   axiomatic design principles. In this study, axiomatic design principles
   proposed by Suh are used under fuzzy environment. Both independence
   axiom and information axiom are utilized. The independence axiom is used
   for the following goals; (1) obtaining a design map, (2) determining
   design parameters and their importance, and (3) calculating the
   functional independency of the proposed design. In the scope of this
   paper, to calculate the functional independence, new formulas are
   presented under fuzzy environment differing from classical axiomatic
   design principles. Then, information axiom is used to determine the best
   design among the designs that satisfy independence axiom and put forward
   to suitable design characteristics. Furthermore the importances of
   functional requirements for the indicator panel design are determined by
   using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process in the presented study. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We consider the harmonic inversion problem, and the associated spectral
   estimation problem, both of which are key numerical problems in NMR data
   analysis. Under certain conditions (in particular, in exact arithmetic)
   these problems have unique solutions. Therefore, these solutions must
   not depend on the inversion algorithm, as long as it is exact in
   principle. In this paper, we are not concerned with the algorithmic
   aspects of harmonic inversion, but rather with the sensitivity of the
   solutions of the problem to perturbations of the time-domain data. A
   sensitivity analysis was performed and the counterintuitive results call
   into question the common assumption made in ``super-resolution{''}
   methods using nonuniform data sampling, namely, that the data should be
   sampled more often where the time signal has the largest signal-to-noise
   ratio. The numerical analysis herein demonstrates that the spectral
   parameters (such as the peak positions and amplitudes) resulting from
   the solution of the harmonic inversion problem are least susceptible to
   the perturbations in the values of data points at the edges of the time
   interval and most susceptible to the perturbations in the values at
   intermediate times. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biogas production through anaerobic biodigestion represents an important
   breakthrough for the problem of swine waste and energy availability for
   rural areas. This work aimed to develop a study to estimate the economic
   viability of a biointegrated system installation and operation to
   produce electricity from swine wastes. Data for the study were collected
   in an agroindustry where there are plenty of agricultural activities;
   however the swine production activity was selected for the anaerobic
   digestion process because it generates a large amount of waste, with a
   limited provision in the environment, which characterizes a case study.
   The analyzed biodigester is a continuous tubular model with brick
   concrete duct and plastic covering with a gasometer, and where the waste
   of 2,300 fattening pigs are deposited daily. The initial investment
   estimate for the installation was R\$ 51,537.17. The system annual costs
   were R\$ 5.708,20, for maintenance, R\$ 4,390.40 for depreciation and
   R\$ 1,366.77 for interests. It was concluded that the biointegrated
   system would achieve favorable economic results if the energy
   consumption were to 35 kW per hour a day, in average, where the net
   present value (NPV) is R\$ 9,494.90 and the internal rate of return

Abstract = {{Objective
   This study investigated the effect of regular orange juice consumption
   on blood lipids and lipoproteins of normolipidemic men and women.
   Methods
   All volunteers (n=29) consumed 750mL of orange juice daily for 60 days.
   Biochemical variables such as lipid profile, apolipoproteins, glucose,
   paraoxonase 1, and HDL size, were measured before and after the orange
   juice consumption period. Anthropometric and dietary data were also
   collected.
   Results
   Daily consumption of orange juice significantly reduced total
   cholesterol in men (11\%, p<0.05) and women (10\%, p<0.05) and
   LDL-cholesterol (15\%, p<0.05) in men and women. HDL-C and Apo A-I also
   decreased, reflecting the reduction in total cholesterol.
   Triacylglycerols, apolipoprotein B, PON 1, HDL size, BMI, body fat, and
   waist circumference were not affected by orange juice consumption.
   Conclusion
   Orange juice presented cholesterol-lowering activity and the association
   between citrus flavonoids and vitamin C may prevent oxidative stress and
   the development of atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{We consider Laurent polynomial (LP) matrices defined on the unit circle
   of the complex plane. QR decomposition of an LP matrix A(s) yields QR
   factors Q(s) and R(s) that, in general, are neither LP nor rational
   matrices. In this paper, we present an invertible mapping that
   transforms Q(s) and R(s) into LP matrices. Furthermore, we show that,
   given QR factors of sufficiently many samples of A(s), it is possible to
   obtain QR factors of additional samples of A(s) through application of
   this mapping followed by interpolation and inversion of the mapping. The
   results of this paper find applications in the context of signal
   processing for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless
   communication systems that employ orthogonal frequency-division
   multiplexing (OFDM).}},

Abstract = {{High throughput metabolic profiling via the metabolome-wide association
   study (MWAS) is a powerful new approach to identify biomarkers of
   disease risk, but there are methodological challenges: high
   dimensionality, high level of collinearity, the existence of peak
   overlap within metabolic spectral data, multiple testing, and selection
   of a suitable significance threshold. We define the metabolome-wide
   significance level (MWSL) as the threshold required to control the
   family wise error rate through a permutation approach. We used H-1 NMR
   spectroscopic profiles of 24 h urinary collections from the INTERMAP
   study. Our results show that the MWSL primarily depends on sample size
   and spectral resolution. The MWSL estimates can be used to guide
   selection of discriminatory biomarkers in MWA studies. In a simulation
   study, we compare statistical performance of the MWSL approach to two
   variants of orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS) method with respect
   to statistical power, false positive rate and correspondence of ranking
   of the most significant spectral variables. Our results show that the
   MWSL approach as estimated by the univariate t test is not outperformed
   by OPLS and offers a fast and simple method to detect disease-related
   discriminatory features in human NMR urinary metabolic profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Gene clustering is very important for extracting underlying biological
   information of gene expression data. Currently, SOM (self-organizing
   maps) is known as one of the most popular neural networks applied for
   gene clustering. However, SOM is sensitive to the initialization of
   neurons' weights. In this case, biologists may need to spend a lot of
   time in repeating experiments until they obtain a satisfactory
   clustering result. In this paper, we apply QBSOM (query-based SUM) to
   tackle the drawbacks of SOM. We have tested the proposed method by
   several kinds of real gene expression data. Experimental results show
   that QBSOM is superior to SOM in not only the time consumed but also the
   result obtained. Considering the gene clustering result of YF (yeast
   full) dataset, QBSOM yields 17\% less in MSE (mean-square-error) and
   68\% less in computation cost compared with SOM. Our experiments also
   indicate that QBSOM is particularly adaptive for clustering high
   dimensional data such as the gene expression data. It is better than SUM
   for system convergence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   first author of this paper in 2007 are the same as those of the constant
   average acceleration method (AAM) for linear elastic systems, except
   that the capability to capture dynamic loading was not explored. It was
   found that there were different quadrature equations to predict the next
   step displacement increment. A modified quadrature equation of this
   method was derived so that the equation to determine the next step
   displacement was numerically equivalent to the equation used in the
   constant AAM. It was verified that the original form of this method, in
   general, had a better capability to capture dynamic loadings than the
   constant AAM. This excellent property, in addition to computational
   efficiency, will help to make this method competitive with general
   second-order accurate integration methods.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica in
   sediment cores is important for paleoclimate reconstruction, especially
   in non-carbonate sediments, where no other bioindicators such as
   ostracods and foraminifera are available. Since most currently available
   analytical techniques are time-consuming and labour-intensive, we have
   developed a new, safer, faster and semi-automated online approach for
   measuring oxygen isotopes in biogenic silica. Improvements include
   software that controls the measurement procedures and a video camera
   that remotely records the reaction of the samples under BrF5 with a CO2
   laser. Maximum safety is guaranteed as the laser-fluorination unit is
   arranged under a fume hood in a separate room from the operator. A new
   routine has been developed for removing the exchangeable hydrous
   components within biogenic silica using ramp degassing. The sample plate
   is heated up to 1100 degrees C and cooled down to 400 degrees C in 7 h
   under a flow of He gas (the inert Gas Flow Dehydration method - iGFD)
   before isotope analysis. Two quartz and two biogenic silica samples
   (similar to 4.5 mg) of known isotope composition were tested. The
   isotopic compositions were reproducible within an acceptable error;
   quartz samples gave a mean standard deviation of <0.15 parts per
   thousand (1(sigma) and for biogenic silica <0.25 parts per thousand
   (1(sigma) for samples down to similar to 0.3 mg. The semi-automated
   fluorination line is the fastest method available at present and enables
   a throughput of 74 samples/week. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The present study has been carried out to evaluate the radioprotective
   effect of Trigonella foenum seeds extract (TFE) on peripheral blood of
   mice. For this purpose, mice were orally given double distilled water
   (control) or optimum dose (100 mg/kg of body weight per day) of TFE for
   five consecutive days (experimental). Thirty minutes after the last
   administration of double distilled water or TFE, these were exposed
   whole-body to 5 Gy gamma radiation and autopsied between 12 hours to 30
   days for hematological and biochemical estimation. Total erythrocyte
   count, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit percentage were decreased from
   normal in both the groups. A significant increase in these parameters
   was observed in TFE administered irradiated group, in contrast to
   without TFE irradiated one, by restoring towards normal values at the
   end of the experiment. From the results, it is evident that TFE may be
   responsible for the protection of stem cells in bone marrow which
   subsequently resulted in higher hematological constituents in peripheral
   blood. The study concludes the prophylactic use of such plant extract
   against radiation induced hematological alterations.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient realization of linear space-variant (non-convolution)
   filters is a challenging computational problem in image processing. In
   this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to filter an image with a
   Gaussian-like elliptic window of varying size, elongation and
   orientation using a fixed number of computations per pixel. The
   associated algorithm, which is based upon a family of smooth compactly
   supported piecewise polynomials, the radially-uniform box splines, is
   realized using preintegration and local finite-differences. The
   radially-uniform box splines are constructed through the repeated
   convolution of a fixed number of box distributions, which have been
   suitably scaled and distributed radially in an uniform fashion. The
   attractive features of these box splines are their asymptotic behavior,
   their simple covariance structure, and their quasi-separability. They
   converge to Gaussians with the increase of their order, and are used to
   approximate anisotropic Gaussians of varying covariance simply by
   controlling the scales of the constituent box distributions. Based upon
   the second feature, we develop a technique for continuously controlling
   the size, elongation and orientation of these Gaussian-like functions.
   Finally, the quasi-separable structure, along with a certain scaling
   property of box distributions, is used to efficiently realize the
   associated space-variant elliptical filtering, which requires O(1)
   computations per pixel irrespective of the shape and size of the filter.}},

Abstract = {{To effectively segment and select suppliers, a two-phase hybrid model
   was developed in this study for that purpose. Phase I developed a
   genetic simulated annealing k-means algorithm (GSKA) integrating genetic
   algorithm (CA), simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and k-means
   algorithm, and suppliers were clustered using this algorithm according
   to the characteristics for customer needs including multiple dimensions
   product cost, product quality and manufacturing time. In phase 2, a
   multi-criterion optimization mathematical model on supply partnership
   characterizing quality, cost and time was constructed based on the
   clusters from phase 1, and then the proposed Genetic Simulated Annealing
   Algorithm (GSA) was used to solve the optimization model to find the
   optimum supplier combinations. To prove the efficiency of the proposed
   model, a case study concerned with notebook computers was introduced in
   this study. According to the analysis results, the GSK A produced in
   phase 1 proved to be superior to k-means model and genetic k-means
   algorithm (GKA) model, while the multi-objective optimization model GSA
   proposed in phase 2 still proved better than GA. Moreover, by selecting
   suppliers after cluster analysis, unwanted candidate suppliers could be
   effectively eliminated, and the resulting supplier combination could
   still meet customer needs.}},

Abstract = {{The observation of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) shows that a tibia
   bone is a kind of bioceramic composite consisting of hydroxyapatite
   layers and collagen protein matrix. All the hydroxyapatite layers are
   parallel with the surface of the bone and consist of numerous
   hydroxyapatite sheets. The observation also shows that there is a kind
   of intercrossed microstructure of the hydroxyapatite sheets. In this
   kind of microstructure, the hydroxyapatite sheets in an arbitrary
   hydroxyapatite layer make a large intercrossed angle with the
   hydroxyapatite sheets in their adjacent hydroxyapatite layers. The
   maximum pullout force of the intercrossed microstructure, which is
   closely related to the fracture toughness of the bone, is investigated
   and compared with that of the parallel microstructure of the sheets
   through their representative models. The result of the investigation
   indicates that the maximum pullout force of the intercrossed
   microstructure is markedly larger than that of the parallel
   microstructure, which is experimentally verified.}},

Abstract = {{C-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.X) is one of the key enzymes for the
   biosynthesis of puerarin. This paper describes the methodology in
   purification and assay of the enzyme for the first time in Puerarin
   lobate (Willd.) Ohwi. C-glucosyltransferase from roots of P lobate was
   extracted and partially purified by (NH4)(2)SO4 saturation. The effects
   of pH, temperature, and substrate concentration on the activity of the
   enzyme were investigated. The properties of the puerarin produced by
   C-glucosyltransferase were studied by thin layer chromatography (TLC)
   and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The peak activity of
   C-glucosyltransferase was detected in fraction of by 80\% saturation of
   (NH4)(2)SO4 and the optimal conditions for enzymatic reaction were 35.5
   mu mol l(-1) of isoliquiritigenin and 560 mu mol l(-1) of UDP-G at pH
   8.1, 28 degrees C for 1 h. Mn2+ at 1 mmol l(-1) and Al3+ at 1 mmol l(-1)
   increased the enzyme activity while Mg2+ inhibited its activity The
   enzyme activity in Nicotiana tabacum and P lobate were detected under
   the above assay conditions. Higher activity was found in roots than in
   leaves and stems of P lobate, while no enzyme activity was detected in
   leaves of N. tabacum. It was the first time that activity of
   C-glucosyltransferase, which transforms isoliquiritigenin to puerarin,

Abstract = {{Single-crystalline Sb2S3 nanotubes have been successfully prepared by a
   simple hydrothermal method. It was found that ethylenediaminetetraacetic
   acid (EDTA) plays a key role in the formation of Sb2S3 nanotubes.
   Without EDTA, only irregular particles with a size of several
   micrometers were produced. The morphology and structure of the obtained
   Sb2S3 nanotubes were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, and EDS analysis in
   detail. UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy was further employed to estimate the
   band gap energy of the obtained products. The measurement of the optical
   properties revealed that the obtained nanotubes have a band gap of 1.55
   eV. The obtained Sb2S3 nanotubes may find potential applications in
   photoelectronic and solar energy because the experimental band gap is
   close to the optimum value for photovoltaic conversion. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Vaccines provide a powerful tool to combat devastating human disease.
   The identification of distinct glycoprotein and glycolipid constructs
   that are over expressed on the cell surfaces of malignant cells has
   spurred intense research into exploiting these tumour-associated
   carbohydrate antigens (TACA) for the development of anticancer vaccines.
   Recently, some synthetic immunogenic carbohydrate-protein conjugates
   have been advanced to clinical trials. In this review, the progress of
   TACA based vaccine molecules will be demonstrated, which including
   design strategies of vaccines, structure and total synthesis of TACA
   molecules, vaccine carrier protein and vaccine adjuvants. Problems and
   solutions related to total synthesis of oligosaccharides, components of
   vaccine candidates and pre-clinical results are also discussed.}},

   10.1152/ajpregu.00439.2009.-Distention of the proximal colon may have
   inhibitory or excitatory effects on the rectum and vice versa. The
   reflexes between the proximal colon and the rectum have not been well
   studied due to difficulties in accessing the proximal colon. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the reflex responses and their mechanisms
   between the proximal colon and the rectum in consideration of
   distention-related changes in tone and compliance of these regions as
   well as anal sphincter relaxation in a canine model. Proximal
   colon/rectal tone, compliance, and anal sphincter relaxation were
   investigated in six dogs chronically implanted with a proximal colon
   cannula while in the fasting state and during proximal colon distention
   or rectal distention. It was found that: 1) both rectal distention and
   proximal colon distention significantly and substantially decreased the
   compliance of the opposite regions, and guanethidine abolished proximal
   colon distention-induced changes in rectal compliance; 2)
   rectal/proximal colon distension decreased proximal colonic/rectal tone,
   and guanethidine abolished both of these inhibitory effects; 3) the anal
   sphincter was more sensitive to rectal distention than proximal colon
   distention; and 4) the minimal distention pressure required to induce
   anal inhibitory reflex was lower for rectal distention than proximal
   colon distention. It was concluded that distention-related changes in
   tone and compliance suggest the long inhibitory reflexes between the
   proximal colon and the rectum with the sympathetic involvement in rectal
   responses. The anal sphincter is more sensitive to the distention of the
   rectum than that of the proximal colon.}},

Abstract = {{A micro region measuring system has been developed to achieve the

   The proposed system uses a long-distance microscope and digital speckle

   especially suited for the long-term measurement of the nonuniform
   deformation. The creep tension tests are performed to obtain the creep
   strain distribution and evolution inside the thermal barrier coating
   specimen. According to the deformation measured from different micro
   regions, we obtained some fundamental knowledge about the time-dependent
   behavior of the failure mechanism in multi-layer coatings. The accuracy
   of the new measuring system and the corresponding error analyses are

Abstract = {{Inspired by Weber's Law, this paper proposes a simple, yet very powerful
   and robust local descriptor, called the Weber Local Descriptor (WLD). It
   is based on the fact that human perception of a pattern depends not only
   on the change of a stimulus (such as sound, lighting) but also on the
   original intensity of the stimulus. Specifically, WLD consists of two
   components: differential excitation and orientation. The differential
   excitation component is a function of the ratio between two terms: One
   is the relative intensity differences of a current pixel against its
   neighbors, the other is the intensity of the current pixel. The
   orientation component is the gradient orientation of the current pixel.
   For a given image, we use the two components to construct a concatenated
   WLD histogram. Experimental results on the Brodatz and KTH-TIPS2-a
   texture databases show that WLD impressively outperforms the other
   widely used descriptors (e.g., Gabor and SIFT). In addition,
   experimental results on human face detection also show a promising
   performance comparable to the best known results on the MIT+CMU frontal
   face test set, the AR face data set, and the CMU profile test set.}},

Abstract = {{Proper application of Design of experiments (DOE) methodologies is a
   critical component of Six Sigma and other quality management programs
   However, classical DOE methodologies are typically considered loo
   cumbersome or difficult, and many quality engineers resort to guesswork
   and trial-and-error when optimizing a design or process. It is therefore
   imperative that engineering and technology programs that train students
   to be competent in Six Sigma provide training in It DOE methodologies,
   including not only classical styles but alternatives such as Taguchi
   Parameter Design (TPD). Students need to understand the application of
   various DOE methodologies in a Six Sigma program, including which
   specific methodology is ideal in a given situation. This stiffly
   outlines the differences between classical DOE and TPD in optimization.
   Students learning Six Sigma techniques receive an optimization problem
   and split into two project teams, one using a full factorial design and
   one using TPD. The results support the literature indicating that TPD is
   a very capable and much more efficient method for optimization than
   traditional DOE full factorial designs.}},

   mixed Fisher and Arrow-Debreu market with homogeneous and log-concave
   utility functions; 2. The Fisher and Arrow-Debreu markets with several
   classes of concave non-homogeneous utility functions; are convex or
   log-convex. Furthermore, an equilibrium can be computed as convex
   optimization by an interior-point algorithm in polynomial time.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular responses to many external stimuli are mediated by
   mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). We investigated whether
   dynamic intracellular movement contributes to the spatial and temporal
   characteristics of the responses elicited by a prototypic MAPK, Fus3, in
   the mating pheromone response pathway in budding yeast (Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae). Confining Fus3 in the nucleus, via fusion to a histone H2B,
   reduced MAPK activation and diminished all responses (pheromone-induced
   gene expression, cell cycle arrest, projection formation, and mating).
   Elimination of MAPK phosphatases restored more robust outputs for all
   responses, indicating that nuclear sequestration impedes full MAPK
   activation but does not abrogate its functional competence. Restricting
   Fus3 to the plasma membrane, via fusion to a lipid-modified CCaaX motif,
   led to MAPK hyperactivation yet severely impaired all response outputs.
   Fus3-CCaaX also caused aberrant cell morphology and a proliferation
   defect. Unlike similar phenotypes induced by pathway hyperactivation via
   upstream components, these deleterious effects were independent of the
   downstream transcription factor Ste12. Thus, appropriate cellular
   responses require free subcellular MAPK transit to disseminate MAPK
   activity optimally because preventing dynamic MAPK movement either
   markedly impaired signal-dependent activation and/or resulted in
   improper biological outputs.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Chrysoporthe includes important pathogens of plantation-grown
   Eucalyptus spp. and has been reported from several tree genera in the
   order Myrtales in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. During
   disease surveys in South China, fruiting structures typical of
   Chtysoporthe spp. were observed on cankers on Eucalytus spp. and
   Syzygium cumini trees. The aim of this study was to confirm the identity
   of the Chrysoporthe cubensis infecting the Eucalyspnis spp. and S.
   cumini and to test the pathogenicity of the fungus. Following glasshouse
   trials to select virulent isolates, field inoculations were undertaken
   to screen different commercial Eucalyptus genotypes for their
   susceptibility to the fungus. Isolates were characterized based on their
   morphology and DNA sequence data for the P-tubulin and internal
   transcribed spacer regions of the ribosomal DNA. Results showed that the
   putative pathogen represented the Asian form of C. cubensis, which
   occurred on numerous different Eucalyptus spp. and hybrid clones as well
   as S. cumini. Field inoculations showed that all six of the Eucalyptus
   genotypes tested are susceptible to infection by C. cubensis.
   Significant differences were observed between them, providing prospects
   to select disease-tolerant planting stock in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Following the Chichi Earthquake (M(L)=7.3) in 1999, sediment-related
   disasters, such as landslides and debris flows, have become more
   frequent in Taiwan. Because engineering structures cannot be fully and
   rapidly emplaced, the government has initiated non-structural hazard
   mitigation programs. Initially, community debris flow evacuation drills
   were promoted in 2000. Typhoon Toraji caused numerous debris flow events
   in July 2001, and some communities evacuated according to the drills,
   significantly reducing the numbers of possible casualties. Based on that
   result, the government expanded the program for evacuation drills.
   Secondly, the early warning system created after the Chichi Earthquake
   will prevent many potential future casualties. Rainfall threshold values
   for debris flow warnings in different areas are determined from
   information received from local weather stations and modified for local
   geomorphologic situations. Realtime information is gradually being
   integrated to create a debris flow disaster warning system, the goal of
   which is to provide warnings to zones in which debris flows are likely.
   The warning system was launched in 2005 and has two levels of alarms:
   yellow and red. The final, red alarm triggers enforced evacuation.
   Overall, the decrease in casualties from debris flows during the decade
   after the Chichi Earthquake is not the result of a decrease in number or
   severity of sediment related disasters, but is more directly related to
   the gradually improved early warning and evacuation system. However, the
   compound hazards resulting from Typhoon Morakot in 2009 remind us of the
   ongoing need for improving the existing mitigation system.}},

Abstract = {{The parametric instability on lateral bending vibrations of a spinning

   to discretize the equations of motion into time-dependent ordinary
   differential equations with gyroscopic terms. A set of second-order
   ordinary differential equations with periodic coefficients of
   Mathieu-Hill type is formed to obtain the boundary frequencies of
   instability regimes. The influence of twist angle, spinning speed,

Abstract = {{A novel unsymmetrical diamine, 1,3-bis(4-aminophenoxy)naphthalene, was
   prepared through the nucleophilic displacement of
   1,3-dihydroxynaphthalene with p-fluoronitrobenzene in the presence of
   potassium carbonate, followed by catalytic reduction with hydrazine. A
   series of novel aromatic polyimides containing bis(phenoxy)naphthalene
   units were synthesized from the unsymmetrical diamine and a range of
   aromatic tetracarboxylic dianhydrides via the usual two-step procedures
   that included ring-opening polyaddition and thermal/chemical
   cyclodehydration. The poly(amic acid)s had inherent viscosities ranging
   from 0.65 to 2.01 dL/g. All the poly(amic acid)s could be converted
   thermally into transparent, flexible, and tough polyimide films. Most of
   the polyimides were soluble in organic solvents, such as
   dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, m-cresol, or o-chlorophenol
   due to the unsymmetrical and bulky pendant naphthalene groups. The
   tensile strength and elongation at break of the polyimide films ranged
   from 74 to 97 MPa and 4 to 7\%, respectively. These polyimides had glass
   transition temperatures ranging from 221 to 312 A degrees C.
   Thermogravimetric analysis revealed these polymers to be fairly stable
   up to 500 A degrees C, and the 10\% weight loss temperature were
   recorded in the range of 531-580 A degrees C in nitrogen and 522-570 A
   degrees C in air. The substituted position effect of
   bis(phenoxy)naphthalene on the properties of the polyimides were
   investigated. The polyimides derived from unsymmetrical 1,3-substituted
   bis(4-aminophenoxy) naphthalene showed better solubility without
   sacrificing their thermal and mechanical properties due to the
   unsymmetrical and bulky pendant effects.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape amenities and disamenities are important factors for
   households in making residence decision. This study presents a hedonic
   analysis of the amenity and disamenity effects arising from the
   heterogeneous urban landscape in a Chinese city. The sample is composed
   of 358 apartment characteristics and transaction data collected directly
   from home owners in the central built-up area of Shenzhen. Four types of
   urban landscapes were included, namely urban parks, residential gardens,
   Shenzhen Bay, and urban villages. We applied a three-dimensional model
   (availability, accessibility, and visibility) to estimate the
   amenity-disamenity effects of these urban landscape features. The
   results indicated that residential gardens were the most attractive
   landscape (an average increase of 17.2\% of housing price) and urban
   villages had disamenity effects (a decrease of 3.72\% for visibility and
   2.5\% for availability). The visibility of landscape was more valued
   than the accessibility. The lower weight accorded to the availability
   variable suggested: both benefits and possible negative impacts related
   to urban parks and Shenzhen Bay could be embodied in home buyers'
   behaviour; and the unavoidability of urban villages. The findings could
   provide insights to the location and design of residential areas
   vis-a-vis amenity-disamenity landscape features in Chinese cities that
   are rapidly expanding and redeveloping.}},

Abstract = {{Peer-to-peer (P2P) and service technology have been used in electronic
   commerce (e-commerce). To resolve network congestion and other problems
   in e-commerce applications, the e-commerce distribution systems based on
   the traditional paradigm are nowadays replaced by peer-to-peer systems
   that have a lot of advantages for e-commerce applications especially in
   digital content distribution field. Service technology can shield the
   heterogeneous platforms and is suitable for e-commerce applications. For
   these commerce applications, the security and P2P rights management
   become more and more urgent, and some new schemes and solutions are
   expected to function automatically or semi-automatically. In this paper,
   a secure digital content distribution scheme is presented, which can
   trace illegal distributors in P2P commerce applications. In this scheme,
   each decrypted media copy contains unique information that identifies
   the peer. The decryption operation and fingerprint embedding operation
   arc combined together, which avoids the leakage of plain media content.
   Additionally, these operations are implemented by the peer, which makes
   the scheme compliant with existing P2P Digital Rights Management (DRM)
   systems and very proper for P2P digital content distribution in
   e-commerce applications. As an example, the structure and payment mode
   of secure media distribution in e-commerce environment are presented and

Abstract = {{Food riots in the Elizabethan-Jacobean period were an explosive
   expression of discontent over the threat of food scarcity and
   starvation. They were ritualistic acts used by the commoners to compel
   the authorities to meet the standards of moral economy and to respect
   the plebeians' legitimate right to eat. In Coriolanus, Shakespeare
   highlights contemporary Jacobean food riots by rewriting and
   transferring the belly fable incident of usury riots into food riots and
   by repetitively referring to famine, hunger, and food hoarding in the
   riot scenes. Like Shakespeare's contemporary food rioters, the mobs in
   Coriolanus do not rise up to subvert the established social order; they
   revolt in order to alert the authorities that their grievances must be
   heard and respected. By portraying the crowd as exceptionally
   well-organized, the playwright transforms the play into a social
   critique to encourage his audience to think about the potential danger
   of popular disruptions and to urge the authorities to contemplate the
   consequences of ignoring the popular voice. Through this critique, the
   dramatist also manages to display how hunger can turn into a formidably
   collective power that poses a serious threat to the ruling authorities.}},

Abstract = {{Extraction of soil with solvents is commonly used to isolate fractions
   of soil organic matter (SOM) thought to cause soil water repellency.
   Previous studies have assessed the efficiency of extraction procedures
   by determining sample water repellency and S OM content, before and
   after extraction, and the ability of extracts to render wettable
   materials repellent. Here we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the
   direct, high-resolution examination of the effects of the most commonly
   used solvent (isopropanol/ammonia) on physicochemical properties of soil
   particle surfaces. Particles, from three pairs of wettable and water
   repellent sandy soils, were examined before and after Soxhlet extraction
   and following extract application to extracted soil material.
   Complementary evidence was provided by comparison with the effects of
   exposing clean sand to organic compounds of known composition. The
   extraction rendered all soils wettable and resulted in a reduction in
   particle surface area covered by SOM. Subsequent exposure of these
   wettable particles to extracts (i) re-introduced some level of water
   repellency despite achieving only a minimal increase in SUM; (ii) led to
   a more uniform scatter of soft regions, indicative of SOM; but (iii) did
   not consistently recreate original surface features. The outcomes
   suggest that (i) although isopropanol/ammonia extraction may be able to
   isolate key compounds involved in causing water repellency, these
   compounds appear to be obtained in a form with little affinity for clean
   mineral surfaces; (ii) the extent and distribution of SUM on soil
   particle surfaces appears to be a critical factor in the expression of
   water repellency.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose:
   To evaluate the distribution of anterior chamber angle (ACA) parameters
   and to assess association of these parameters with age in Asian
   subjects.
   Methods:
   Four hundred and thirty-nine consecutive Korean subjects aged from 30 to
   89 were enrolled from a university clinic. All participants were scanned
   using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT, Visante,
   version 2.0). We measured ACA parameters such as anterior chamber depth
   (ACD), angle opening distance at 500 and 750 mu m (AOD(500,750)), angle
   recess area at 500 and 750 mu m (ARA(500,750)), trabecular iris space
   area at 500 and 750 mu m (TISA(500,750)), and determined age-related
   changes in these parameters with use of a linear mixed effect model that
   adjusted for gender, axial length, intraocular pressure, and keratometry
   data. Slopes of ACA parameters as a function of age were determined. For
   various AS-OCT parameters, the normalized slope was calculated by
   dividing the slope by the mean value.
   Results:
   All analysed ACA parameters decreased with age in both nasal and
   temporal quadrants. Axial length and keratometry data were significant
   covariates for ACA changes. The slopes of ACD were -0.02396 mm/year,
   AOD(500), ARA(500), and TISA(500) measured at the temporal angle were
   -0.00634 mm/year, -0.0019 mm2/year, and -0.00177 mm2/year, respectively.
   There was no age-dependent difference in central corneal thickness (p
   value; 0.4597) Based on the normalized slopes, the AOD showed the
   steepest slope at both temporal and nasal sectors.
   Conclusion:
   All ACA parameters assessed by AS-OCT, which accounted for other ocular
   biometric parameters, showed significant negative slopes with increasing
   age. These results should be considered when assessing changes in the
   anterior chamber over time.}},

Abstract = {{The thermoluminescence (TL) properties of CVD diamond film irradiated
   with beta rays and illuminated with UV and visible light (200-450 nm)
   have been studied. The film (23 mm) was grown for 47 h on
   monocrystalline silicon. The TL glow curves are similar for beta
   irradiation and short wavelength UV light. The beta dose response curves
   and UV light time response curves exhibit linear-supralinear-sublinear
   behaviour. The structure of the glow curve was determined by a
   simultaneous deconvolution of a set of curves recorded after preliminary
   heating to various temperatures. One set of the TL peak parameters was
   found for all the curves during the deconvolution. The TL glow curves
   were found to consist of five strongly overlapped peaks. The peaks at
   about 350 and 400 K obey first-order kinetics. The next three peaks at
   about 480, 540 and 580 K are described well by general-order kinetics.
   The TL curves created with light of wavelength between 250 and 450 nm

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that all tree-level string theory amplitudes can be
   computed using the BCFW recursion relations. Our proof utilizes the
   pomeron vertex operator introduced by Brower, Polchinski, Strassler, and
   Tan. Surprisingly, we find that in a particular large complex momentum
   limit, the asymptotic expansion of massless string amplitudes is
   identical in form to that of the corresponding field theory amplitudes.
   This observation makes manifest the fact that field-theoretic Yang-Mills
   and graviton amplitudes obey KLT-like relations. Moreover, we conjecture
   that in this large momentum limit certain string theory and field theory
   amplitudes are identical, and provide evidence for this conjecture.
   Additionally, we find a new recursion relation which relates tachyon
   amplitudes to lower-point tachyon amplitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Across two experiments, the cognitive salience of a stigmatized ingroup
   identity harmed self-evaluation and elicited stereotype-consistent
   behavior to the degree that participants endorsed the political status
   quo. In Experiment 1, ethnic identity salience caused Filipina domestic
   workers in Hong Kong to evaluate their own labor as meriting less pay if
   they were high in social dominance orientation but more pay if they were
   low in social dominance orientation. In Experiment 2, gender identity
   salience caused women in the US to evaluate their work on a logic task
   (but not a verbal task) as meriting less pay if they were politically
   conservative but more pay if they were politically liberal-a pattern
   mirrored in task performance. Depending on the degree to which the
   political status quo is accepted or rejected, findings suggest that
   members of stigmatized groups can be either implicit participants in
   their own subjugation or agents of change. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{565-573}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Well-recognized markers for static (one time) or dynamic
   (monitoring over time) dehydration assessment have not been rigorously
   tested for their usefulness in clinical, military, and sports medicine
   communities.
   Objective: This study evaluated the components of biological variation
   and the accuracy of potential markers in plasma, urine, saliva, and body
   mass (B-m) for static and dynamic dehydration assessment.
   Design: We studied 18 healthy volunteers (13 men and 5 women) while
   carefully controlling hydration and numerous preanalytic factors.
   Biological variation was determined over 3 consecutive days by using
   published methods. Atypical values based on statistical deviations from
   a homeostatic set point were examined. Measured deviations in body fluid
   were produced by using a separate, prospective dehydration experiment
   and evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to
   quantify diagnostic accuracy.
   Results: All dehydration markers displayed substantial individuality and
   one-half of the dehydration markers displayed marked heterogeneity of
   intraindividual variation. Decision levels for all dehydration markers
   were within one SD of the ROC criterion values, and most levels were
   nearly identical to the prospective group means after volunteers were
   dehydrated by 1.8-7.0\% of B-m. However, only plasma osmolality (P-osm)
   showed statistical promise for use in the static dehydration assessment.
   A diagnostic decision level of 301 +/- 5 mmol/kg was proposed. Reference
   change values of 9 mmol/kg (P-osm), 0.010 {[}urine specific gravity
   (U-sg)], and 2.5\% change in B-m were also statistically valid for
   dynamic dehydration assessment at the 95\% probability level.
   Conclusions: P-osm is the only useful marker for static dehydration
   assessment. P-osm, U-sg, and B-m are valid markers in the setting of
   dynamic dehydration assessment. Am J Clin Nutr 2010;92:565-73.}},

Title = {{The Effects of Online User Reviews on Movie Box Office Performance:
   Accounting for Sequential Rollout and Aggregation Across Local Markets}},
Journal = {{MARKETING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{944-957}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Our objective in this paper is to measure the impact (valence, volume,
   and variance) of national online user reviews on designated market area
   (DMA)-level local geographic box office performance of movies. We
   account for three complications with analyses that use national-level
   aggregate box office data: (i) aggregation across heterogeneous markets
   (spatial aggregation), (ii) serial correlation as a result of sequential
   release of movies (endogenous rollout), and (iii) serial correlation as
   a result of other unobserved components that could affect inferences
   regarding the impact of user reviews. We use daily box office ticket
   sales data for 148 movies released in the United States during a
   16-month period (out of the 874 movies released) along with user review
   data from the Yahoo! Movies website. The analysis also controls for
   other possible box office drivers. Our identification strategy rests on
   our ability to identify plausible instruments for user ratings by
   exploiting the sequential release of movies across markets-because user
   reviews can only come from markets where the movie has previously been
   released, exogenous variables from previous markets would be appropriate
   instruments in subsequent markets.
   In contrast with previous studies that have found that the main driver
   of box office performance is the volume of reviews, we find that it is
   the valence that seems to matter and not the volume. Furthermore,
   ignoring the endogenous rollout decision does not seem to have a big
   impact on the results from our DMA-level analysis. When we carry out our
   analysis with aggregated national data, we obtain the same results as
   those from previous studies, i.e., that volume matters but not the
   valence. Using various market-level controls in the national data model,
   we attempt to identify the source of this difference.
   By conducting our empirical analysis at the DMA level and accounting for
   prerelease advertising, we can classify DMAs based on their
   responsiveness to firm-initiated marketing effort (advertising) and
   consumer-generated marketing (online word of mouth). A unique feature of
   our study is that it allows marketing managers to assess a DMA's
   responsiveness along these two dimensions. The substantive insights can
   help studios and distributors evaluate their future product rollout
   strategies. Although our empirical analysis is conducted using motion
   picture industry data, our approach to addressing the endogeneity of
   reviews is generalizable to other industry settings where products are
   sequentially rolled out.}},

Title = {{Boundary entropy of supersymmetric Janus solutions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we compute the holographic boundary entropy for half-BPS
   Janus deformations of the AdS(3) x S-3 x T-4 vacuum of type IIB
   supergravity. Previous work {[}24] has shown that there are two
   independent deformations of this sort. In one case, the six-dimensional
   dilaton jumps across the interface, while the other case displays a jump
   of axion and four-form potential.
   In case of a jump of the six-dimensional dilaton, it is possible to
   compare the holographic result with the weak-coupling result for a
   two-dimensional interface CFT where the radii of the compactified bosons
   jump across the interface. We find exact agreement between holographic
   and CFT results. This is to be contrasted with the holographic
   calculation for the non-supersymmetric Janus solution, which agrees with
   the CFT result only at the leading order in the jump parameter.
   We also examine the implications of the holographic calculation in case
   of a solution with a jump in the axion, which can be associated with a
   deformation of the CFT by the Z(2)-orbifold twist operator.}},

Abstract = {{The design of an embedded-feed type microstrip patch antenna, which can
   be mounted on metallic objects for radio frequency identification
   (RFID), is presented. The structure consists of an embedded feed with
   T-matching networks and a symmetrical radiating rectangular loop patch.
   The proposed antenna has no shorting plate or via hole and consists of a
   very thin structure of microstrip patch antenna compared with the
   conventional metallic tag antennas. The impedance of the presented
   antenna can be changed to match the impedance values of tag chips by
   using the T-matching network. The gain radiation pattern performance of
   the proposed antenna on metal surface is improved so that it can be used
   for a tag antenna mountable on metal surface in ultra-high frequency
   (UHF) band RFID applications. The antenna is analysed by full wave
   simulations, and experimental results are provided for the manufactured
   prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Background Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by clinical

   a patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy following acute infarction

   Case Report A 52-year-old man was admitted with acute infarction of the
   left middle cerebral artery territory and acute chest pain. Acute
   myocardial infarction was suspected because of elevated serum troponin
   levels and hypokinesia of the left ventricle on echocardiography.
   However, a subsequent coronary angiography revealed no stenosis within
   the coronary arteries or ballooning of the apical left ventricle.
   Conclusions We postulated that catecholamine imbalance due to the
   insular lesion could be responsible for these interesting features. J

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The objective of this study was to determine Bcl-2 expression in
   localized prostate cancer and its potential role as a predictive factor
   for biochemical recurrence (BCR).
   Materials and Methods
   This study included 171 Korean patients with newly diagnosed
   adenocarcinoma of the prostate who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP)
   without neoadjuvant therapy at a single center between February 2005 and
   May 2009. RP specimens obtained from these patients were analyzed for
   the expression of Bcl-2 using tissue microarray. The values of Bcl-2 and
   other clinicopathologic factors were evaluated. Statistical analysis was
   performed with contingency table analysis, chi-square tests, and a Cox
   proportional hazard model.
   Results
   Bcl-2 expression was immunohistologically-confirmed in 42 patients
   (24.6\%). Bcl-2 expression was not associated with conventional
   clinicopathologic factors. Bcl-2 negative patients had a significantly
   longer mean BCR-free survival than Bcl-2-positive patients (p=0.036).
   Among several variables, a high Gleason score in the RP specimen (>= 8),
   extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), lymphovascular
   invasion (LVI), and Bcl-2 expression were significant predictors of BCR
   based on univariate analysis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards
   analysis revealed that BCR was significantly associated with a high
   prostate specific antigen level (p=0.047), SVI (p<0.001), a positive
   surgical margin (p=0.004) and Bcl-2 expression (p=0.012).
   Conclusion
   Bcl-2 expression in RP specimens is associated with a significantly
   worse outcome, suggesting a potential clinical role for Bcl-2.
   Post-operative Bcl-2 could be a significant predictor of outcome after
   RP.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of tropical rainforest in Amazon is critically vulnerable to
   the change in rainfall and radiation than in temperature, and that
   amount of rainfall and cloudiness in the northeast region of South
   American is strongly affected by the Atlantic sea surface temperature
   (SST) Results from recent model experiments for future climate
   projection have indicated a reduction of Amazonian greenness by a
   weakening of tropical vapor circulation system related with the change
   in SST Therefore, the observational investigation of the relations
   between the Amazon greenness and Atlantic SST is fundamental to
   understand the response of Amazonian tropical forest to climate change.
   In this study, the effect of Atlantic SST on the spatial and temporal
   change of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the
   Amazonian region is examined by using satellite remote sensing data for
   the period of 1981-2001. A strong correlation between NDVI and SST is
   found for certain regions in Amazon during the periods of 1980s and
   1990s, respectively. In addition, strong correlations with NDVI lagging
   behind SST for two months and one year, respectively, are also
   identified from the interannual December-to-February (rain season)
   variations during 1981-2001. Despite these findings, the mechanisms
   behind the identified correlation remain unclear Further analyses using
   observed precipitation and radiation data are required to understand the
   potential changes of Amazonian rainforest in the context of global

Abstract = {{Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with chronic kidney failure are
   intolerant to most disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and
   NSAIDs due to their potential toxicities. Although the tumor necrosis
   factor (TNF) inhibitors have emerged as a highly effective treatment for
   RA, their safety and efficacy in RA patients with chronic kidney failure
   have not been well reported. We retrospectively evaluated the safety and
   efficacy of etanercept treatment in RA patients with chronic kidney
   failure. We describe three RA patients with chronic kidney failure who
   had been treated with DMARDs, steroids and NSAIDs, but were discontinued
   from these classical agents due to several side effects and
   nephrotoxicity. The patients were treated with 25 mg of etanercept once
   or twice a week. We evaluated disease activity and used decreasing renal
   function and increasing number of infections to monitor safety. All
   three patients improved after starting etanercept treatment and their
   steroid requirements were decreased. Linear relationships between
   Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation (MDRD) glomerular
   filtration rate (GFR) and time were observed. Thus, in all patients, the
   changes in GFR did not represent superimposed acute drug toxicity, but
   rather chronic progressive renal failure. These cases show that
   etanercept may be a safe and effective treatment option for RA patients
   with chronic kidney failure.}},

Abstract = {{Among woody plants, grapevines are often described as highly vulnerable
   to water-stress induced cavitation with emboli forming at slight
   tensions. However, we found native embolism never exceeded 30\% despite
   low xylem water potentials (Psi(x)) for stems of field grown vines. The
   discrepancy between native embolism measurements and those of previous
   reports led us to assess vulnerability curve generation using four
   separate methods and alterations (i.e. segment length and with/without
   flushing to remove embolism prior to measurement) of each. Centrifuge,
   dehydration and air-injection methods, which rely on measurement of
   percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC) in detached stems, were
   compared against non-invasive monitoring of xylem cavitation with
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. Short segment air-injection
   and flushed centrifuge stems reached > 90 PLC at Psi(x) of-0.5 and -1.5
   MPa, respectively, whereas dehydration and long-segment air-injection
   measurements indicated no significant embolism at Psi(x) > -2.0 MPa.
   Observations from NMR agreed with the dehydration and long segment
   air-injection methods, showing the majority of vessels were still
   water-filled at Psi(x) > -1.5 MPa. Our findings show V. vinifera stems
   are far less vulnerable to water stress-induced cavitation than
   previously reported, and dehydration and long segment air-injection
   techniques are more appropriate for long-vesseled species and organs.}},

   parameters such as the gap between upper die and lower binder to avoid
   the fracture and the position of an initial lower binder are optimized
   using thermo-mechanical analysis. As a result of the simulation, contact
   gap and initial binder position for successful hot stamping are
   determined as 5mm and 35mm, respectively. Through the hot stamping
   experiment using form type die set under the optimized condition, a high
   strength center pillar without defects such as wrinkle and fracture can

Abstract = {{Role based access control (RBAC) assigns access permissions to a role
   rather than a user. This simplifies access control management by simply
   assigning appropriate roles to users and by modifying the permissions of
   the roles. With the advent of ubiquitous computing, many kinds of
   services, especially personalized services to give convenience to users,
   have been introduced. Among them, providing proper access permissions to
   users based on the current context has become an important issue because
   their status and access privilege should be dynamically changed.
   Previously, various access control methods utilizing context awareness
   have been proposed; however, their constraint description methods, used
   to assign a role to a user, are quite complex and not enough to express
   detailed context. Also, they do not fully cover the various situations
   that can be occur red in ubiquitous computing environments. In this
   paper, we propose an access control scheme, combining RBAC with context
   awareness, to give proper privilege to users based on their current
   context in ubiquitous computing environments. Our scheme defines the
   constraints for assigning a role and modifying the permissions of each
   role, enabling more detailed descriptions. We also provide various
   access control algorithms to support diverse situations which occur in
   ubiquitous computing environments.}},

Abstract = {{Although there are numerous studies on the consequences of demographic
   diversity, relatively little research has been conducted on what
   determines the variation of demographic diversity. This study examines
   what factors are related to variations in two dimensions of
   diversity-race/ethnicity and gender-using data from the 291 federal
   agencies. The diversity models were tested using the ordinary least
   squares multiple regression method and the clustered robust standard
   errors method. The results show that the type of policy responsibility
   of the agency and task professionalization are important predictors of
   workforce diversity. The regulatory and distributive agencies have
   significantly lower levels of race/ethnic diversity. The redistributive
   agencies, however, tend to be more diversified in terms of
   race/ethnicity. Interestingly, gender diversity is positively associated
   not only with professionalized occupations but also with
   nonprofessionalized white-collar occupations, suggesting that gender is
   well balanced across the white-collar occupations in federal workforces.}},

Abstract = {{High-power phosphor-based LEDs are replacing conventional white-light
   sources for vertical scanning interferometry, but the spectrum of the
   phosphor-based LED is different from that of the conventional light

   conventional light source has only one peak in the Gaussian
   distribution. In this Letter, we investigate the effects of
   phosphor-based LEDs on vertical scanning interferometry. Our result
   shows that the use of a phosphor-based LED changes the fringe contrast
   function significantly, such that measurement repeatability decreases.
   We propose and demonstrate that a constraint on the input to the

Abstract = {{Megalin-mediated endocytic uptake constitutes the main pathway for
   clearance of plasma proteins from the glomerular filtrate in proximal
   tubules. Little is known, however, about mechanisms that control megalin
   expression and activity in the kidney. A widely discussed hypothesis
   states that upon ligand binding a regulated intramembrane proteolysis
   releases the cytosolic domain of megalin and this fragment subsequently
   modulates megalin gene transcription. Here, we tested this by generating
   a mouse model that co-expressed both the soluble intracellular domain
   and full-length megalin. Despite pronounced synthesis in the proximal
   tubules, the soluble intracellular domain failed to exert distinct
   effects on renal proximal tubular function, including megalin
   expression, endocytic retrieval of proteins, or global renal gene
   transcription. Hence, our study argues that the soluble intracellular
   domain does not have a role in regulating the activity of megalin in the
   kidney. Kidney International (2010) 78, 473-477;

Abstract = {{The molecular basis for the recognition of glucose as a germinant
   molecule by spores of Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 has been examined. A
   chromosome-located locus (BMQ\_1820, renamed gerWB) is shown to encode a
   receptor B-protein subunit that interacts with the GerUA and GerUC
   proteins to form a receptor that is cognate for both glucose and
   leucine. GerWB represents the third receptor B protein that binds to
   glucose in this strain. Site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) experiments
   conducted on charged proline and aromatic residues predicted to reside
   in the transmembrane domains of a previously characterized receptor B
   protein, GerVB, reveal the importance to receptor function of a cluster
   of residues predicted to reside in the middle of the transmembrane 6
   (TM6) domain. Reductions in the region of 70- to 165-fold in the
   apparent affinity of receptors for glucose in which Glu196, Tyr191, and
   Phe192 are individually replaced by SDM indicate that some or all of
   these residues may be directly involved in the binding of glucose and
   perhaps other germinants to the germinant receptor.}},

Abstract = {{We present two empirical studies of visual search in dynamic 3D
   visualisations of large, randomly ordered, photo collections. The aim is
   to assess the possible effects of geometrical distortions on visual
   search effectiveness, efficiency and comfort, by comparing the influence
   of two perspective representations of photo collections on participants'
   performance results and subjective judgments. Thumbnails of the 1000 or
   so photographs in each collection are plastered on the lateral surface
   of a vertical cylinder, either on the inside (inner view, IV) or on the
   outside (outer view, OV). IV and OV suggest two different interaction
   metaphors: locomotion in a virtual space (IV) versus manipulation of a
   virtual object (DV). They also implement different perspective
   distortions: enlargement and distortion of lateral columns (IV) versus
   enlargement of central columns and dwindling plus distortion of lateral
   columns (OV). Presentation of results focus on the second study, S2,
   which involved 20 participants and offered them strictly identical
   interaction facilities with the two views, unlike the initial pilot
   study, Si (8 participants and slightly different interaction facilities
   between the two views).
   Participants in both studies were experienced computer users (average
   age: 25.15 years, SD: 3.13). They performed two types of basic visual
   tasks that are carried out repeatedly while navigating photo
   collections: (i) searching for a photo meeting specific, visual and
   thematic, criteria, the photo and its location in the collection being
   unknown to participants (ST1) and (ii) looking for a visually familiar
   photo, the location of the photo being familiar to participants (ST2).
   According to post-experiment questionnaires and debriefings, all
   participants in S2 save one judged both 3D views positively in reference
   to standard 2D visualisations. Half of them preferred IV over OV, four
   appreciated OV better, and six expressed no clear opinion. Preferences
   were mainly motivated by the effects of perspective distortions on
   thumbnail visibility. They were barely influenced by interaction
   metaphors (e.g., the feeling of immersion induced by IV).
   Despite large inter-individual differences in performance, a majority of
   participants carried out ST1 tasks more effectively and efficiently with
   IV than with OV, as regards error rates (statistically significant
   difference) and search times (tendency). Performance results for ST2
   tasks were similar with the two views, due, probably, to the simplicity
   and brevity of ST2 tasks. Perspective distortions seem to have exerted
   less influence on participants' visual strategies than horizontal
   scrolling, a dynamic feature common to both views. Qualitative analyses
   of participants' behaviours suggest that IV has the potential to support
   spatial memory better than OV, presumably thanks to the locomotion
   metaphor.
   These results indicate that perspective views have the potential to
   facilitate and improve visual search in unstructured picture collections
   provided that distortions are adapted to users' individual visual
   capabilities. Further research is needed to better understand: (i) the
   actual relations between visual exploration strategies and geometrical
   properties of perspective visualisations and (ii) the influence of the
   manipulation and locomotion metaphors on spatial memory. This knowledge
   is necessary to further improve the comfort and effectiveness of visual
   search in large unstructured picture collections, using 3D
   visualisations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Wilms' tumour: a systematic review of risk factors and meta-analysis.
   Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 2010.
   Wilms' tumour comprises 95\% of all renal cancers among children less
   than 15 years of age. The purpose of this review is to examine the
   existing literature on perinatal and environmental risk factors for
   Wilms' tumour. A search for epidemiological studies that examined risk
   factors for Wilms' tumour was undertaken in Medline, LILACS, ISI Web of
   Science and Dissertation Abstracts. A total of 37 studies, including 14
   cohort, 21 case-control and 2 case-cohort studies, were identified that
   examined environmental and perinatal risk factors. Most studies were
   from Western Europe and North America, and among case-control studies,
   16 used randomly selected population-based controls.
   We observed a significantly increased risk of Wilms' tumour with
   maternal exposure to pesticides prior to the child's birth (OR = 1.37
   {[}95\% CI 1.09, 1.73]), high birthweight (OR = 1.36 {[}95\% CI 1.12,
   1.64]) and preterm birth (OR = 1.44 {[}95\% CI 1.14, 1.81]), although
   the results regarding pesticide exposure may be subject to publication
   bias (Egger's test, P = 0.09). Further analyses to adjust for the
   heterogeneity in the results for high birthweight and preterm birth did
   not statistically change the significance of the results. Additionally,
   an increased though not statistically significant risk of Wilms' tumour
   was associated with maternal hypertension (OR = 1.30 {[}95\% CI 0.99,
   1.72]), and, compared with the first born, being a second or later birth
   was associated with a significantly decreased risk (OR = 0.82 {[}95\% CI
   0.71, 0.95]). This review suggests a role for several perinatal and
   environmental risk factors in the aetiology of Wilms' tumour.}},

Abstract = {{The precursor was obtained through the reaction between SnCl4.5H(2)O and
   NaOH in the presence of PEG400 (polyethylene glycol, M = 400). Tin oxide
   (SnO2) nano-powders were prepared by heating the precursor with
   microwave method. SnO2 thick film sensors were fabricated using SnO2
   nano-materials as sensing materials. The phase composition and
   morphology of the material particles were characterized through X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   respectively. The average particle sizes of the samples obtained with
   616 W microwave heating and 800 W microwave heating (20 min) are about 5
   and 15 nm, respectively. The influence of the heating duration and
   heating power on the gas-sensing properties of sensors based on SnO2
   nano-materials were investigated. The sensitivities of the sensors based
   on SnO2 nano-materials heated with 616 and 800W for 20 min were higher
   than those of the sensors based on SnO2 nano-materials heated with 136,
   264 and 440 W for 20 min. When operating at 200-310 degrees C, the
   sensor based on SnO2 heated with 616 W for 20 min exhibits highest
   sensitivities in all sensors based on SnO2 heated with 616 W for
   different duration. The sensitivity to a few kinds of organic gases,
   such as (CH3)(3)N and (CH3)(2)CO were studied. It was found that the
   sensor based on SnO2 nano-materials (with 616 W microwave heating for 20
   min) exhibited good performance characterized by high sensitivity and
   short response time to dilute trimethylamine when operated at 255
   degrees C. The sensitivity to 0.001 ppm (CH3)(3)N at 255 degrees C was
   3. The response time and recovery time were about 30 and 100 s,
   respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights

Title = {{Multiscale dynamic analysis of blast furnace system based on intensive

Journal = {{CHAOS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the Hilbert-Huang transform method and time delay
   embedding method are applied to multiscale dynamic analysis on the time
   series of silicon content in hot metal collected from a medium-sized
   blast furnace with the inner volume of 2500 m(3). The results provide
   clear evidence of multiscale features in blast furnace ironmaking
   process. Ten intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are decomposed from the
   silicon content time series; the presence of noninteger fractal
   dimension, positive finite Kolmogorov entropy, and positive finite
   maximum Lyapunov exponent are found in some IMF components. In addition,
   the coupling of subscale structures of blast furnace system is studied
   using the dimension of interaction dynamics and a robust algorithm for
   detecting interdependence. It is found that IMF(3) is the main driver in
   the coupling system IMF(2) and IMF(3) while for the coupling system
   IMF(3) and IMF(4) neither subsystem can act as the driver. All these
   provide a guideline for studying blast furnace ironmaking process with
   multiscale theory and methods, and may open way for more candidate tools
   to model and control blast furnace system in the future. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{In this paper, two LiAlH4-NaNH2 samples with LiAlH4 to NaNH2 molar ratio
   of 1/2 and 2/1 were investigated, respectively. It was observed that

   the reaction pathways were different. For the LiAlH4-NaNH2 (1/2) sample,
   Li3Na(NH2)(4) and NaAlH4 were formed through cation exchange between
   reactants. The NaAlH4 formed further reacts with Li3Na(NH2)(4) and NaNH2
   to give H-2, NaH and LiAlN2H2. For the LiAlH4-NaNH2 (2/1) sample,
   Li3Na(NH2)(4), LiNH2 and NaAlH4 were formed firstly through the same
   cation exchange process. The resulting LiNH2 reacts with the remaining

Abstract = {{Background: Millions of family members deliver informal care and support
   to patients with heart failure (HF). Caregivers of patients with HF
   experience depressive symptoms, but factors associated with depressive
   symptoms are unknown. The purposes of this study were (1) to examine
   differences between caregivers with and without depressive symptoms in
   patients' characteristics and caregivers' functional status, caregiving
   burden (time devoted to caregiving, difficulty of caregiving tasks, and
   overall perceived caregiving distress), and perceived control; and (2)
   to determine predictors of depressive symptoms of caregivers. Method: A
   total of 109 caregivers (mean age of 57 years; spousal caregiver, 79\%)
   and patients with HF participated in this study. Depressive symptoms,
   perceived control, and functional status of both patients and caregivers
   were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II, the Control
   Attitudes Scale-Revised, and the Duke Activity Status Index,
   respectively. Caregivers' burden (time and difficulty of caregiving
   tasks and burden) were assessed using the Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale
   and the Zarit Burden Interview. Results: The 27.5\% of HF caregivers
   with depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory II score >= 14) had
   poorer functional status, lower perceived control, and higher perceived
   caregiving distress; experienced more caregiving difficulty; and spent
   more time in caregiving tasks than did caregivers without depressive
   symptoms. Controlling for age and sex in a multiple regression,
   caregivers' own functional disability (standard beta {[}s beta] = -.307,
   P < .001), perceived control (s beta = -.304, P < .001), and caregiver
   burden (s beta = .316, P = .002) explained 45\% of the variance in
   caregivers' depressive symptoms. Patients' New York Heart Association
   class and functional status did not predict caregivers' depressive
   symptoms. Conclusion: Caregivers' poor functional status, overall
   perception of caregiving distress, and perceived control were associated
   with depressive symptoms. Depressed caregivers of patients with HF may
   benefit from interventions that improve caregivers' perceived control,
   address the caregiving burden, and improve or assist with caregivers'
   functional status.}},

   envisaged in patients who have had access to specialized medical core,
   and agree with a prolonged medical follow-up.
   After 60 years old, physiological age and comorbidities need to be
   highly considered.
   In genetic obesity and craniopharyngioma, surgery is exceptional.
   Main contraindications consist in severe disorders in feeding be
   non-stabilized psychiatric disorders, alcoholism, drug addiction,
   inability to participate in prolonged medical follow-up.
   Surgical process includes many important stages: preparation and
   information by a multidisciplinary team (identify contraindication, give
   optimal information, look for and treat comorbidities {[}as sleep
   apneoas syndrome, diabetes, cardiopulmonary disease], assess nutritional
   and psychological status and feeding behaviour); the decision of
   intervention during a concerted analysis by a multidisciplinary team;
   follow-up (for life) led to screen for nutritional deficiencies and
   surgical complications, to reinforce diet and physical activity
   counselling, to adopt to new situations (as pregnancy), and advise
   psychological care if necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Background. This study analyzes the outcome of esophageal resection in
   patients 70 or more years of age, compared with patients aged less than
   70 years and identifies risk factors for worse outcome in the elderly.
   Methods. Comorbidity, postoperative morbidity, in-hospital mortality and
   survival rates were compared between 811 patients aged less than 70
   years and 250 patients aged 70 years or more who underwent esophagectomy
   for esophageal cancer in a single high-volume center from 1985 to 2005.
   Results. Groups were similar regarding surgical approach, resectability,
   and tumor stage. More patients aged 70 years or more had cardiovascular
   and respiratory concomitant disease. Among patients aged 70 years or
   more, the prevalence of adenocarcinoma and Barrett's transformation was
   higher (67\% versus 53\% for patients aged less than 70 years, and 22\%
   versus 15\%, respectively). There were no differences in surgical
   complications (20\% versus 17\%). Nonsurgical complications occurred
   more in patients aged 70 years or more (35\% versus 27\%) and operative
   mortality was higher among elderly patients (8.4 versus 3.8\%), as was
   in-hospital mortality (11.6\% versus 5.4\%). The disease-specific 5-year
   survival was lower for patients aged 70 years or more (27\% versus
   34\%). The 1-year survival, reflecting the impact of operative morbidity
   and mortality, was 58\% for patients aged 70 years or more and 68\% for
   the patients aged less than 70 years (p = 0.002). Among patients aged 70
   years or more, respiratory comorbidity and thoracoabdominal resection
   were risk factors for the occurrence of nonsurgical complications and
   respiratory comorbidity for in-hospital mortality.
   Conclusions. Older patients have increased operative and in-hospital
   mortality and decreased 5-year survival after esophageal resection for
   cancer. Our results indicate that especially thoracoabdominal resection
   for esophageal carcinoma should be carefully considered for patients
   older than 70 years who suffer from respiratory disease.}},

   40\% of women watched >= 2 hours TV/day; 9\% and 6\% respectively
   watched 4 hours/day. For both men and women, hours TV/day was associated
   with less than tertiary education, living outside of state capital

   the precision and the bias and agreement between arms when using
   mechanomyography or acceleromyography}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{310-317}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background. Studies comparing acceleromyography and mechanomyography
   indicate that the two methods cannot be used interchangeably. However,
   it is uncertain to what extent differences in precision between the
   methods and the naturally occurring arm-to-arm variation have influenced
   the results of these studies. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was
   to examine the precision and the arm-to-arm variation, when the same
   method is used on both of the arms.
   Methods. In the first part (n=20), mechanomyography was applied
   bilaterally and in the second part acceleromyography (n=20). Anaesthesia
   was induced with propofol and opioid, and neuromuscular block with
   rocuronium 0.6 mg kg(-1). The precision of the two methods and the bias
   and limits of agreement between the arms were evaluated using
   train-of-four (TOF) stimulation, without and with referral to the
   initial baseline value, that is, normalization.
   Results. Both methods were found to be precise (<5\% variation) without
   any difference between the dominant and non-dominant arms. There were no
   significant biases between the arms, except for the onset time obtained
   with acceleromyography, which was 10\% longer for the dominant arm.
   However, the individual differences (limits of agreement) were wide
   (0.20-0.25 at TOF 0.90). Normalization during recovery did not change
   bias or limits of agreement between the arms.
   Conclusions. In the research setting, acceleromyography and
   mechanomyography are both precise methods without difference between the
   arms. Although there is no mean bias between the arms, both methods show
   wide individual differences (limits of agreement), which might to a
   large extend explain the differences often found when two different
   methods are compared on the contralateral arms.}},

   provide working for power systems in a secure and economical way. RPO is
   used for the voltage control, decreasing of active power losses, and for
   the optimization of the power coefficients. In RPO the non-linear power
   loss function is used as a purpose function to be minimized. The control
   parameters of that function are bus voltages of the generators, level
   settings of transformers and the reactive power output values of the
   capacitors added to buses. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, one of
   the intuitive methods is used in this optimization study. In this study,
   by using the ABC algorithm, RPO provided on the IEEE 6-bus and IEEE
   30-bus test systems. The ABC algorithm is compared with some heuristic

Abstract = {{Cybersemiotics, in forging a new philosophy of science, addresses the
   failure of all disciplines to recognize and adequately account for
   qualia and motivation, interrogates the status of `knowing' contra the
   computational information-processing paradigm, and explores the role of
   the observer in knowing. The present article discusses these key
   features of cybersemiotics and, in particular, their consequences for
   biosemiotics (to which cybersemiotics is a contributor). It argues that
   the constructivist basis of `languaging' in the cybersemiotic project
   presents a potential impediment. It suggests that although `language' is
   clearly in question in conceptualizing `knowing' and `observing', the
   main issue for cybersemiotics has to do with the more general process of
   `modelling' that features in biosemiotics. Whilst the future of research
   in the sphere of biosemiotics will be enhanced by a greater
   understanding of `observership', the article argues that aspects of the
   relationship of constructivism and realism will need to be made clear,
   and that the tools for this are available closer to `cybersemiotics'
   home in general semiotics.}},

Abstract = {{The alleged discovery of the sites of Sodom and Gomorrah by the French
   traveler Louis Felicien de Saulcy in 1851 provided the occasion for a
   series of debates in Britain on the question of biblical authority that
   were also, for some audiences, about examining the crimes and sins of
   the Sodomites and defining them openly as homoerotic lust. In this way,
   and at this moment, questions of same-sex desire became an important
   accompaniment to pressing debates about faith. / REPRESENTATIONS 112.

Abstract = {{The securing elements presented in the paper are constituted from
   composite materials, realized by the embedding of the glass-coated
   ferromagnetic microwires (MW) in a celullosic matrix. These can be used

   The advantages of the MW securing were: the possibility of the
   identifying at distance, stable magnetic properties, even at high
   temperatures and corrosive media; stability at the mechanical action,
   small sizes and low consumption. A detector, specially designed,
   validates the presence of the ferromagnetic MW into the paper. Their
   metallic core, prepared from soft magnetic alloys, and their sizes,
   compatible with the sizes of the cellulosic fibers, even they are in the
   matrix randomly oriented disposed, recommend them as perfect filler for
   securing elements based on paper.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Acrophobia is one of the most prevalent phobias, affecting
   as many as 1 in 20 individuals. Of course, heights often evoke fear in
   the general population too, and this suggests that acrophobia might
   actually represent the hypersensitive manifestation of an everyday,
   rational fear. In this study, we assessed the role of sensory and
   cognitive variables in Acrophobia. Methods: Forty-five participants
   (Mean age 25.07 years, 71\% female) were assessed using a booklet with
   self-reports as well as several behavioral measures. The data analysis
   consisted in multivariate linear regression using fear of heights as the
   outcome variable. Results: The regression analyses found that visual
   field dependence (measured with the rod and frame test), postural
   control (measured with the Sharpened Romberg Test), space and motion
   discomfort (measured with the Situational Characteristics
   Questionnaire), and bodily symptoms (measured with the Bodily Sensation
   Questionnaire) all serve as strong predictors for fear of heights
   (Adjusted r(2) =.697, P <.0001). Trait anxiety (measured with the State
   Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y-2) was not related with fear of heights,
   suggesting that this higher order vulnerability factor is not necessary
   for explaining this particular specific phobia in a large number of
   individuals. Conclusion: The findings reveal that fear of heights is an
   expression of a largely sensory phenomena, which can produce strong
   feelings of discomfort and fear in the otherwise calm individuals. We
   propose a theory that embraces all these factors and provides new
   insight into the aetiology and treatment of this prevalent and
   debilitating fear. Depression and Anxiety 27:864-870, 2010. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Fenestrations are pores in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells that
   filter substrates and debris between the blood and hepatocytes.
   Fenestrations have significant roles in aging and the regulation of
   lipoproteins. However their small size (<200 nm) has prohibited any
   functional analysis by light microscopy. We employed structured
   illumination light microscopy to observe fenestrations in isolated rat
   liver sinusoidal endothelial cells with great clarity and spatial
   resolution. With this method, the three-dimensional structure of
   fenestrations (diameter 123 +/- 24 nm) and sieve plates was elucidated
   and it was shown that fenestrations occur in areas of abrupt cytoplasmic
   thinning (165 +/- 54 nm vs. 292 +/- 103 nm in non-fenestrated regions, P
   < 0.0001). Sieve plates were not preferentially co-localized with
   fluorescently labeled F-actin stress fibers and endothelial nitric oxide
   synthase but appeared to occur in primarily attenuated non-raft regions
   of the cell membrane. Labyrinthine structures were not seen and all
   fenestrations were short cylindrical pores. In conclusion,
   three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy has enabled the
   unlimited power of fluorescent immunostaining and co-localization to
   reveal new structural and functional information about fenestrations and
   sieve plates. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Materials and methods: In total, 104 subjects aged 20-27 years were
   included in the study. The salivary flow rate, buffer capacity, salivary
   mutans streptococci and lactobacilli counts were detected in each
   subject after a 3-week washout period using chair-side kits at baseline.
   Subjects were randomly assigned into three groups: Group I consumed 100
   mL kefir per day (n=35); Group II consumed 2 x 100 mL kefir per day
   (n=35); and Group III consumed 100 mL milk (n=34). A questionnaire
   investigating the oral and dietary habits of the subjects was also
   filled out by each subject. After 3 weeks of consumption of the
   experimental materials, salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli
   counts were reevaluated.
   Results: Statistically significant reductions were observed in both
   salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in Group II compared to
   the baseline (P = 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively).
   Conclusion: Short-term consumption of kefir might reduce high levels of
   salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.}},

Title = {{Disentangling the gamma-ray emission of NGC 1275 and that of the Perseus
   cluster}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{519}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context. The Gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters hosting active
   galaxies is a complex combination of diffuse and point-like emission
   features with different spectral and spatial properties.
   Aims. We discuss in details the case of the Perseus cluster containing
   the radio-galaxy NGC 1275 that has been recently detected as a bright
   gamma-ray source by the Fermi-LAT experiment, in order to disentangle
   the sources of emission.
   Methods. We provide a detailed study of the gamma-ray emission coming
   from the core of Perseus by modeling the central AGN emission with a
   multiple plasma blob model, and the emission from the extended cluster
   atmosphere with both a warming ray (WR) model and dark matter (DM)
   neutralino annihilation models. We set constraints on both the central
   galaxy and cluster SED models by using both archival multi-frequency
   data and the recent very high energy observations obtained by Fermi and
   MAGIC.
   Results. We find that: i) in all the viable models for the cluster
   gamma-ray emission, the emission detected recently by Fermi from the
   center of the Perseus cluster is dominated by the active galaxy NGC
   1275, that is found in a high-emission state; ii) the diffuse gamma-ray
   emission of the cluster, in the WR model and in the DM models with the
   highest allowed normalization, could be detected by Fermi if the central
   emission from NGC 1275 is in a low-emission state; iii) Fermi can have
   the possibility to resolve and detect the diffuse gamma-ray flux
   (predicted by the WR model) coming from the outer corona of the Perseus
   cluster atmosphere at distances r greater than or similar to 800 kpc.
   These results are consistent with the evidence that in the other
   frequency bands, the diffuse cluster emission dominates on the central
   galaxy one at low radio frequencies with. v less than or similar to 1
   GHz and at X-ray energies of order of E similar to keV.
   Conclusions. Our results show that a simultaneous study of the various
   emission mechanisms that produce diffuse gamma-rays from galaxy clusters
   and the study of the emission mechanisms that produce gamma-rays from
   active galaxies residing in the cluster atmospheres is absolutely
   crucial first to disentangle the spectral and spatial characteristics of
   the gamma-ray emission and secondly to assess the optimal observational
   strategy in the attempt to reveal the still elusive diffuse gamma-ray
   emission widely predicted for the atmospheres of large-scale structures.}},

Abstract = {{Long and dangerous `fragmented journeys' have become a common feature of
   global migration systems. These are more than simple responses to
   stricter migration controls and are associated with related developments
   in technology and communications. They are therefore a structural change
   in migration systems which require a re-examination of the ways in which
   protection is offered to migrants. This has become an important theme of
   international discussion since 2005 but the humanitarian situation of
   international migrants on particular routes remains of concern to aid
   groups and many in the international community. This paper, based on
   research in Morocco, considers the protection needs of three groups of
   `stranded' migrants: yet to be recognized refugees, previously
   recognized refugees and those with other protection needs. It examines
   migration histories to identify reasons why this third group of
   individuals may be unable or unwilling to return and the nature of
   humanitarian assistance they require.}},

Journal = {{INFECTION AND IMMUNITY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{3950-3956}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic movement of B cells increases the probability of
   encountering specific antigen and facilitates cell-cell interactions
   required for mounting a rapid antibody response. B1a and B1b cells are
   enriched in the coelomic cavity, contribute to T-cell-independent (TI)
   antibody responses, and increase in number upon antigen exposure. B1
   cell movement is largely governed by Cxc ligand 13 (Cxcl13), and mice
   deficient in this chemokine have a severe reduction in peritoneal B1
   cells. In this study, we examined the role of Cxcl13-dependent B cell
   migration using Borrelia hermsii infection or intraperitoneal
   immunization with pneumococcal polysaccharide or
   4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl-acetyl (NP)-Ficoll, all of which induce robust
   antibody responses from B1b cells. Surprisingly, we found that antibody
   responses to B. hermsii or to FhbA, an antigenic target of B1b cells,
   and the resolution of bacteremia were indistinguishable between
   wild-type and Cxcl13(-/-) mice. Importantly, we did not observe an
   expansion of peritoneal B1b cell numbers in Cxcl13(-/-) mice.
   Nonetheless, mice that had resolved infection were resistant to
   reinfection, indicating that the peritoneal B1b cell reservoir is not
   required for controlling B. hermsii. Furthermore, despite a reduced
   peritoneal B1b compartment, immunization with pneumococcal
   polysaccharide vaccine yielded comparable antigen-specific antibody
   responses in wild-type and Cxcl13(-/-) mice and conferred protection
   against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Likewise, immunization with NP-Ficoll
   elicited similar antibody responses in wild-type and Cxcl13(-/-) mice.
   These data demonstrate that homing of B1 cells into the coelomic cavity
   is not a requirement for generating protective TI antibody responses,
   even when antigen is initially localized to this anatomical compartment.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   The aim of this study was to investigate whether intraabdominal Ankaferd
   Blood Stopper (ABS) causes increased intraabdominal adhesion formation
   and to determine any side effects of ABS in vivo.
   METHODS
   The present experimental study was designed to examine the effects of
   Ankaferd solution on peritoneal adhesion formation in a rat model of
   cecal abrasion. Intraperitoneal adhesions were assessed macroscopically
   and histopathologically on the 10th postoperative day. The possible
   adverse affects of ABS on liver and lung tissues were analyzed
   histopathologically, and blood chemistry was also evaluated.
   RESULTS
   Our study revealed that ABS reduced intraperitoneal adhesion formation
   in an experimental rat model. The blood chemistry was not disturbed due
   to ABS administration. Intraperitoneal administration of ABS led to some
   minor changes in the lungs and serosal surfaces of the intestines, with
   minor architectural changes in the liver that were not considered as
   toxic. Further studies with various application doses and routes with
   more detailed cellular analysis are thus warranted to clarify the
   possible pleiotropic and adverse effects of this new agent away from
   hemostasis.
   CONCLUSION
   There was less intraperitoneal adhesion formation in the ABS group than
   in the control group and saline group. Intraperitoneal administration of
   ABS has no toxic effects on blood chemistry or the lungs, kidneys and
   the liver, but it has some minor adverse effects.}},

Abstract = {{Egypt is a fast growing Country with 78.9 million population and annual
   per capita installed power 0.286 MW as of July 2008. Moderate to mature
   population and economic growth trends forecast population and annual per
   capita installed power to reach 111 millions and 0.63 MW, respectively
   by 2032; and 128 millions at per capita power of 1.02 MW by 2052. With
   these trends in consideration installed electricity generation capacity
   are forecasted at 70 GW by 2032 and 132 GW by 2052 as compared to the
   2008 installed power of 22.6 GW. Meeting these demands is almost
   impossible using known limited national fossil fuel reserves. Current
   electricity generation policy exhausts about 65\% of country's total
   fossil production. Crude oil reserves are expected to deplete by 2012,
   while gas reserves will be over-strained starting from 2030. A major
   policy shift towards the use of non-fossil resources is to be adopted.
   In the article Egypt's major primary energy resources are evaluated.
   Electricity generation plans till 2022 are presented and an electricity
   generation strategy based on gradual introduction of nuclear power
   starting from 2018 is outlined. A balanced generation mix based on
   72.7\% fossil, 13\% nuclear and 14.3\% renewables is targeted by 2052.
   The mix is supposed to meet Egypt's electricity needs by 2052 and to

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We study a system of diffusing-aggregating particles with deposition and
   evaporation of monomers. By combining theoretical and numerical methods,
   we establish a clearer understanding of the non-equilibrium phase
   transition known to occur in such systems. The transition is between a
   growing phase in which the total mass increases for all time and a
   non-growing phase in which the total mass is bounded. In addition to
   deriving rigorous bounds on the position of the transition point, we
   show that the growing phase is in the same universality class as
   diffusion-aggregation models with deposition but no evaporation. In this
   regime, the flux of mass in mass space becomes asymptotically constant
   (as a function of mass) at large times. The magnitude of this flux
   depends on the evaporation rate but the fact that it is asymptotically
   constant does not. The associated constant flux relation exactly
   determines the scaling of the two-point mass correlation function with
   mass in all dimensions while higher order mass correlation functions
   exhibit nonlinear multi-scaling in dimension less than two. If the
   deposition rate is below some critical value, a different stationary
   state is reached at large times characterized by a global balance
   between evaporation and deposition with a scale-by-scale balance between
   the mass fluxes due to aggregation and evaporation. Both the mass
   distribution and the flux decay exponentially in this regime. Finally,
   we develop a scaling theory of the model near the critical point, which
   yields non-trivial scaling laws for the critical two-point mass
   correlation function with mass. These results are well supported by
   numerical measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity)
   ``Idiopathic environmental intolerance{''} has become the universally
   accepted terminology for a syndrome that has been referred to by various
   names, the most common of which was ``multiple chemical sensitivity{''}.
   This syndrome frequently but not necessarily links a highly varied
   collection of symptoms with an olfactory perception in the general or
   occupational environment of chemicals considered noxious by patients.
   This ailment is mainly studied in Western countries, where its
   prevalence varies quite substantially. Numerous and diverse
   etiopathogenic theories have been proposed, some suggesting a toxic
   cause (immunotoxic or neurotoxic mechanisms, etc.), others suggesting a
   psychopathological origin akin to those of psychosomatic diseases.
   Whatever the cause, this syndrome has highly negative repercussions on
   patients' personal and professional lives. This impact can be reduced
   through a medical approach that takes the patient's complaints into
   account, limits additional testing and workups to what is necessary to
   rule out other diagnoses, and aims at striking the best possible balance
   between banning suspected chemicals and preserving occupational and
   social activities.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative splicing creates diverse mRNA isoforms from single genes and
   thereby enhances complexity of transcript structure and of gene
   function. We describe a method called spliceotyping, which translates
   combinatorial mRNA splicing patterns along transcripts into a library of
   binary strings of nucleic acid tags that encode the exon composition of
   individual mRNA molecules. The exon inclusion pattern of each analyzed
   transcript is thus represented as binary data, and the abundance of
   different splice variants is registered by counts of individual
   molecules. The technique is illustrated in a model experiment by
   analyzing the splicing patterns of the adenovirus early 1A gene and the
   beta actin reference transcript. The method permits many genes to be
   analyzed in parallel and it will be valuable for elucidating the complex
   effects of combinatorial splicing.}},

Title = {{Cigarette Smoking and Adenocarcinomas of the Esophagus and

Abstract = {{Background Previous studies that showed an association between smoking
   and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction were
   limited in their ability to assess differences by tumor site, sex,
   dose-response, and duration of cigarette smoking cessation.
   Methods We used primary data from 10 population-based case-control
   studies and two cohort studies from the Barrett's Esophagus and
   Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium. Analyses were restricted to white
   non-Hispanic men and women. Patients were classified as having
   esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 1540), esophagogastric junctional
   adenocarcinoma (n = 1450), or a combination of both (all adenocarcinoma;
   n = 2990). Control subjects (n = 9453) were population based.
   Associations between pack-years of cigarette smoking and risks of
   adenocarcinomas were assessed, as well as their potential modification
   by sex and duration of smoking cessation. Study-specific odds ratios
   (ORs) estimated using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted
   for age, sex, body mass index, education, and gastroesophageal reflux,
   were pooled using a meta-analytic methodology to generate summary odds
   ratios. All statistical tests were two-sided.
   Results The summary odds ratios demonstrated strong associations between
   cigarette smoking and esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.96, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.64 to 2.34), esophagogastric junctional
   adenocarcinoma (OR = 2.18, 95\% CI = 1.84 to 2.58), and all
   adenocarcinoma (OR = 2.08, 95\% CI = 1.83 to 2.37). In addition, there
   was a strong dose-response association between pack-years of cigarette
   smoking and each outcome (P < .001). Compared with current smokers,
   longer smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk of all
   adenocarcinoma after adjusting for pack-years (< 10 years of smoking
   cessation: OR = 0.82, 95\% CI = 0.60 to 1.13; and >= 10 years of smoking
   cessation: OR = 0.71, 95\% CI = 0.56 to 0.89). Sex-specific summary odds
   ratios were similar.
   Conclusions Cigarette smoking is associated with increased risks of
   adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction in white
   men and women; compared with current smoking, smoking cessation was
   associated with reduced risks.}},

   the national motto becomes the aesthetic standard for judging
   ``beauty{''} and ``ugliness.{''} Beauty contests, for example, become
   sites of contestation in which competing representations of the face of
   the nation jostle for recognition. Identifying with marginalized
   African-Jamaican aspirants who often fail to win these competitions,
   discontented patrons routinely claim the right to assert alternative
   models of beauty that challenge the authority of the ``out of many
   one{''} aesthetic. The emergence of a modeling industry in Jamaica that
   valorizes idiosyncratic style has opened up a space in which black
   images of beauty take center stage. Caribbean Fashion Week is the major
   platform for displaying internationally acclaimed Jamaican models.
   Showcasing a high percentage of decidedly black male and female models
   wearing spectacular designer clothes, Caribbean Fashion Week enables
   multiple readings of the body as cultural text. The permissive modeling
   aesthetic engenders capricious images of beauty that contest the very
   conception of the ``model{''} as a mold into which a singular figure of
   beauty is impressed.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of small molecule metabolites on a large scale offers
   the opportunity for a more complete understanding of cellular
   metabolism. We developed a high-throughput method to quantify primary
   amine-containing metabolites in the yeast Saccharomyces cereyisiae by
   the use of capillary electrophoresis in combination with fluorescent
   derivatization of cell extracts. We measured amino acid levels in the
   yeast deletion collection, a set of 5000 strains each lacking a single
   gene, and developed a computational pipeline for data analysis. Amino
   acid peak assignments were validated by mass spectrometry, and the
   overall approach was validated by the result that expected pathway
   intermediates accumulate in mutants of the arginine biosynthetic
   pathway. Global analysis of the deletion collection was carried out
   using clustering methods. We grouped strains based on their metabolite
   profiles, revealing clusters of mutants enriched for genes encoding
   mitochondrial proteins, urea cycle enzymes, and vacuolar ATPase
   functions. One of the most striking profiles, common among several
   strains lacking ribosomal protein genes, accumulated lysine and a
   lysine-related metabolite. Mutations in the homologous ribosomal protein
   genes in the human result in Diamond-Blackfan anemia, demonstrating that
   metabolite data may have potential value in understanding disease
   pathology. This approach establishes metabolite profiling as capable of
   characterizing genes in a large collection of genetic variants.}},

Abstract = {{This essay examines sports as a repository for both idealized and
   degraded parts of self-experience. Sports as action and fantasy catalyze
   a variety of nostalgic longings, including wishes to resurrect positive
   experiences from childhood as well as to create false, idealized
   fantasies about who we wish we were then and now. Sports also contain
   degraded elements of self that result from attempted reconciliation
   between,playful fantasy and realistic disappointment. Athletes, as the
   containers of these idealized fantasies, are ambivalently held objects,
   adored but also hated because they can never live up to the longed-for
   idealization. The author also examines our longing for a time when play
   was our job and the suspension of disbelief in sports was a shorter jump
   from everyday life than the responsibilities and stresses of adult life
   allow. Nostalgia and the recollection of our sports heroes and our own
   achievements allow us to dip back into that treasure chest of memory
   and, of course, fantasy.}},

   LPS-stimulated macrophages by selectively blocking recruitment of Sp1 to
   the TNF-alpha promoter}},
Journal = {{CELL STRESS \& CHAPERONES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We have previously shown that exposure to febrile-range temperature
   (FRT, 39.5A degrees C) reduces LPS-induced TNF-alpha transcription in
   mouse macrophages through at least two mechanisms: (1) by directly
   recruiting heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) to a heat shock response element
   present in the TNF-alpha 5'-UTR and (2) by markedly reducing LPS-induced
   recruitment of NF kappa B-p65 to the kappa B enhancer (at -510) in the
   TNF-alpha gene. In the present study, we used EMSA and chromatin
   immunoprecipitation assays to further analyze the complex effects of FRT
   on the recruitment of transcription factors and co-activators on the
   TNF-alpha gene in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. Our
   results showed that in FRT-exposed RAW cells, HSF-1 was recruited only
   to the 5'-UTR site, and no additional interaction was evident in the
   TNF-alpha gene up to 1,300 nt upstream of the transcription start site.
   Similarly, FRT exposure selectively reduced LPS-induced NF kappa B-p65
   recruitment to the kappa B enhancer site at -510 without affecting the
   other three kappa B enhancer sites present in the TNF-alpha 5'-flanking
   sequence. Finally, we found that FRT exposure abrogated LPS-stimulated
   recruitment of Sp1 to the proximal TNF-alpha promoter without any change
   in associated histone H3 acetylation around the TNF-alpha promoter and
   despite a marked increase in the total intra-nuclear Sp1 DNA binding
   activity. In conclusion, our studies further emphasize the complex and
   redundant control of TNF-alpha transcription and identify additional
   potential mechanisms through which FRT exposure may reduce TNF-alpha
   expression by selectively modifying gene-specific recruitment of
   transcription factors to the proximal TNF-alpha promoter.}},

Abstract = {{Power-angle curves, describing the isotonic sub-maximal movement of the

   aim of this work was to compare the morphology of power-angle curves of
   pathological subjects (PS) and healthy subjects (HS) and to evaluate the
   feasibility of this approach to discriminate between pathological and
   healthy legs. Isotonic evaluation with leg-extension machine was
   performed on 46 HS and 16 PS previously submitted to knee surgery. The
   healthy group comprised 33 elderly healthy subjects (EHS) (mean: 65
   years) and 13 young healthy subjects (YHS) (mean: 35 years) and the
   influence of age on the curves was evaluated. All subjects performed a
   sub-maximal movement with the legs working alone and together. Each
   curve was interpolated with a parabolic function and the R(2) Pearson
   coefficient was used as a score for morphological regularity. R(2) of
   curves of PS obtained with legs working alone were statistically
   different from those of the HS group, considering both YHS and EHS (p <

Abstract = {{The aim of core needle biopsy (CNB) is to diagnose a breast abnormality
   prior to open surgical excision. The radiology-pathology correlation
   helps in interpretation of pathologic findings and is greatly assisted
   by specimen radiology of all cores performed for calcifications,
   separation of cores containing calcification from those without, and the
   availability of the specimen radiograph to the pathologist at the time
   of reporting. The nature of the imaging abnormality should also be
   clearly conveyed. CNB is processed in a routine manner for paraffin
   embedding with preservation of sufficient material in the block for
   further studies as needed. Possible pitfalls include the loss of
   calcifications at the time of section cutting, calcium remained in the
   formalin of the specimen container, and failure to recognize calcium
   oxalate deposition in the CNB. The challenges of CNB interpretation are
   complicated by the availability of only limited material, but are
   generally similar to those encountered in open surgical excision
   specimens. This discussion focuses on high-risk lesions and lesions that
   raise management issues. The most prudent approach for the pathologist
   is to provide sufficient information to prompt a surgical excision
   without overdiagnosing the lesion, thus placing the patient into the
   appropriate therapeutic algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary amino acid density responses are fairly well documented for Ross
   broilers but are sparse for the Cobb bird. Cobb 500 fast-feathering
   chicks were obtained from a commercial hatchery and fed either high,
   moderate, or low dietary amino acid density diets through a starter (0
   to 14 d, in crumbles), grower (14 to 28 d, in pellets), and finisher (28
   to 42 d, in pellets) phase program, for a total of 17 possible treatment
   combinations at d 42. Before formulation of the experimental diets,
   samples of the protein-contributing ingredients (corn, soybean meal, and
   Pro-Plus) were analyzed for total amino acid concentration. Live
   performance, carcass traits, breast and thigh meat composition, and feed
   cost efficiency served as evaluation criteria for this study. Body
   weight gain (P < 0.05) and feed conversion (P < 0.001) were improved
   when broilers were fed the high diets through most of their life, but
   mortality and BW uniformity remained unaltered (P > 0.05). Carcass yield
   was unaffected (P > 0.05) by dietary treatments. Breast meat yield was
   maximized (P < 0.05) in birds fed the high diets, whereas abdominal fat
   percentage (P < 0.01) was increased in birds fed the low diets. Breast
   meat protein and fat content were unaffected (P > 0.05) by diet, but
   protein concentration of thigh meat increased (P < 0.10) in birds fed
   the high diets compared with those fed the low diets, and birds fed the
   moderate diets had intermediate responses. The benefits observed when
   feeding high amino acid density diets were not necessarily the most
   economical when feeding these throughout the entire grow-out period. The
   Cobb 500 male showed an ability to respond to increasing amino acid
   density as the bird aged, and any beneficial effects of feeding high
   amino acid density diets early in life may not be warranted for this
   strain.}},

   avoid methylphenidate or SSRIs related side effects. Improvement in
   target symptoms were assessed using relevant scales and the Clinical
   Global Impression-improvement (CGI-1) scale.
   Results: Subjects were four boys and three girls (11.85 +/- 2.91 years).
   Duration of methylphenidate and mirtazapine treatment was 14.28 +/- 9.41
   and 3.71 0.95 months respectively. Final dose of mirtaza pine was 16 +/-
   2.64 mg/day. All subjects showed moderate to very much improvement in
   sleep and three subjects showed much improvement in appetite problems on
   CGI-I scale. Six subjects showed mild to very much improvement in
   anxiety disorders /symptoms and one subject showed much improvement in
   depression on CGI-I scale. Mirtazapine was generally tolerated well.
   Most frequently reported side effects were increased appetite (n=5),
   weight gain (n=4; 1000-4000 gm; 1357.14 +/- 1546.88 gm); day time
   sedation (n=4) and irritability (n=2).
   Conclusions: Young subjects with diagnosis of ADHD and comorbid anxiety
   or depressive disorders may benefit from mirtazapine addition
   particularly in the presence of methylphenidate or SSRIs related sleep
   and/or appetite problems.}},

Title = {{Absence of DOMR, a new antigen in the Dombrock blood group system that
   weakens expression of Dob, Gya, Hy, Joa, and DOYA antigens}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:
   The Dombrock (Do) blood group system consists of six distinct antigens:
   Doa, Dob, Gya, Hy, Joa, and DOYA. Our finding of a pregnant patient
   whose red blood cells (RBCs) were Hy+ but whose serum contained an
   apparent alloanti-Hy suggested the presence of a seventh antigen and
   prompted this study.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:
   Standard hemagglutination and polymerase chain reaction-based methods
   were used throughout.
   RESULTS:
   The patient's RBCs typed as Do(a-b+w), Gy(a+w), Hy+w, Jo(a+w), and
   DOYA+w. Her serum agglutinated RBCs with common Dombrock phenotypes. Hy-
   RBC samples were very weakly reactive or nonreactive, Jo(a-) and DOYA-
   RBC samples were reactive, and Gy(a-) RBC samples were nonreactive.
   Reactivity was obtained with RBCs treated with papain or
   alpha-chymotrypsin, but not with RBCs treated with trypsin or
   dithiothreitol. DNA analysis showed the patient to be DO{*}793G
   (DO{*}B/DO{*}B), DO{*}323G, DO{*}350C, DO{*}547T, and DO{*}898G and
   revealed two homozygous nucleotide changes of DO{*}431C > A and
   DO{*}432C > A in Exon 2, which predicts a change of Ala (GCC) at Amino
   Acid 144 to Glu (GAA). This indicates that she is homozygous DO{*}B-WL
   with Nucleotide 431 and 432 changes, which without knowing the effect of
   the two novel changes, is predicted to encode the Do(a-b+), Gy(a+), Hy+,
   Jo(a+), DOYA+ phenotype.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   The antibody in the patient's plasma recognizes the high-prevalence
   antigen absent from her RBCs. The Ala144Glu change caused an absence of
   a high-prevalence Do antigen that we have named DOMR {[}provisional ISBT
   number 014007 (DO7)]. The absence of DOMR is associated with weakening
   of Dob, Gya, Hy, Joa, and DOYA antigens.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is an uncommon and aggressive
   tumour representing only 5-10\% of all thyroid malignancies. MTC arises
   from parafollicular thyroid cells (C-cells) producing calcitonin
   hormone. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most frequent
   thyroid tumour (papillary or follicular), representing 80\% of all
   thyroid cancer. DTC derives from follicular thyroid cells, that come
   from the central thyroid sketch. The association between medullary and
   papillary thyroid cancer is rare. Several cases have been reported of
   mixed carcinomas.
   CASE REPORT: We report two cases of associated medullary and papillary
   carcinomas in two different foci in patients with respectively Graves'
   disease and multinodular goiter. A young woman affected by Grave's
   disease and multinodular goiter under pharmacological treatment with
   antithyroidal drugs underwent total thyroidectomy. The histopathological
   examination revealed the presence of a medullary carcinoma of the middle
   third of right lobe (1.1 cm) with an adjacent papillary microcarcinoma
   (0.5 cm). A 72-years-old woman, affected by euthyroid multinodular
   goiter, underwent total thyroidectomy. The pathological findings were
   two microcarcinomas, medullary (0.44 cm) in the left lobe and papillary
   (0.22 cm) in the right lobe.
   CONCLUSION: We can speculate that this coexistence is inferred, not
   having shown a specific cause that justifies the association between the
   two types of tumour and the high prevalence of papillary carcinoma.}},

Title = {{Measuring Patient Anxiety in Primary Care: Rasch Analysis of the 6-item

Abstract = {{Objectives:
   The 6-item Spielberger State Anxiety Scale has been used as a
   replacement of the original version in many health-care studies. The
   purpose of this study was to evaluate the measurement properties of the
   shortened 6-item Spielberger State Anxiety Scale using Rasch analysis in
   general medical practice patients (N = 297).
   Methods:
   Participants (aged 16 years or above) were recruited on a consecutive
   basis from three general medical practices. Prior to their appointment,
   participants were asked to complete a 6-item Spielberger State Anxiety
   Scale.
   Results:
   The results of the study showed that the scale is unidimentional, and
   each item measures a different level of patient anxiety. The rating
   scale operated well and item and person reliability was good.
   Furthermore, principal-components analysis of the residuals confirmed
   the scale measures a unitary concept. A scoring key was generated to
   allow conversion of raw scores to a continuous measurement.
   Conclusion:
   The 6-item Spielberger State Anxiety Scale is shorter than the original
   version and has good psychometric properties. This would suggest the
   scale is a valid alternative to the full version for use in primary
   health-care practice and research.}},

Abstract = {{The Wnts are a highly conserved family of secreted glycoproteins
   involved in cell-cell signaling and pattern formation during early
   embryonic development. Teasing out the role of individual Wnt molecules
   through development is challenging. Gene duplications are one of the
   most important mechanisms for generating evolutionary variations. The
   current consensus suggests that most anatomical variation is generated
   by divergence of regulatory control regions rather than by coding
   sequence divergence. Thus phylogenetic comparisons of divergent gene
   expression patterns are essential to understanding ancestral
   morphogenetic patterns from which subsequent anatomy diversified in
   modern lineages. We previously demonstrated strongest expression of
   zebrafish wnt9b within its heart tube, limb bud and ventral/anterior
   ectoderm during oral and pharyngeal arch patterning. Our goal is to
   compare and contrast zwnt9b to its closest paralog, zwnt9a. Sequenced,
   fulllength zebrafish wnt9a and wnt9b cDNA clones were used for
   phylogenetic analysis, which suggests their derivation from a common
   pre-vertebrate archeolog by gene duplication and divergence. Here we
   demonstrate that zwnt9a expression is found within unique (CNS,
   pronephric ducts, sensory organs) and overlapping (pectoral fin buds)
   expression domains relative to zwnt9b. Apparently, Wnt9 paralogs
   differentially parsed common ancestral expression domains during their
   subsequent rounds of gene duplication, divergence and loss in different
   vertebrate lineages. This expression data suggests ancestral roles for
   Wnt9s in early patterning of neural/oral-pharyngeal ectoderm and
   mesendoderm derivatives. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Room temperature ferromagnetic hysteresis is observed in commercial
   SrTiO3 substrates purchased from a variety of suppliers. It is shown
   that the ferromagnetic signal comes from the unpolished surfaces.
   Surface impurity phases cannot be detected using either x-ray
   diffraction or energy dispersive x-ray spectra on the unpolished
   surfaces. However, a possible correlation between surface disorder
   (x-ray diffraction peak linewidth) and ferromagnetism is observed. Ar
   ion bombardment (10-90 keV) can be used to produce surface layer
   disorder but is not found to induce ferromagnetism. Annealing of the
   substrates at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1100 degrees C is found
   to alter the hysteresis curves differently depending on whether the
   annealing is performed in air or in vacuum. Identical annealing behavior
   is observed if the substrates are artificially spiked with iron. This
   suggests that the ferromagnetic hysteresis of as purchased SrTiO3 could
   be due to Fe contamination of the unpolished surfaces. In addition, it
   is shown that no ferromagnetism is observed in samples that contain
   10(19)-10(21) cm(-3) of oxygen vacancies if all the faces are polished.

Abstract = {{Datasets from remote-sensing platforms and sensor networks are often
   spatial, temporal, and very large. Processing massive amounts of data to
   provide current estimates of the (hidden) state from current and past
   data is challenging, even for the Kalman filter. A large number of
   spatial locations observed through time can quickly lead to an
   overwhelmingly high-dimensional statistical model. Dimension reduction
   without sacrificing complexity is our goal in this article. We
   demonstrate how a Spatio-Temporal Random Effects (STRE) component of a
   statistical model reduces the problem to one of fixed dimension with a
   very fast statistical solution, a methodology we call Fixed Rank
   Filtering (FRF). This is compared in a simulation experiment to
   successive, spatial-only predictions based on an analogous Spatial
   Random Effects (SRE) model, and the value of incorporating temporal
   dependence is quantified. A remote-sensing dataset of aerosol optical
   depth (AOD), from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR)
   instrument on the Terra satellite, is used to compare spatio-temporal
   FRF with spatial-only prediction. FRF achieves rapid production of
   optimally filtered AOD predictions, along with their prediction standard
   errors. In our case, over 100,000 spatio-temporal data were processed:
   Parameter estimation took 64.4 seconds and optimal predictions and their
   standard errors took 77.3 seconds to compute. Supplemental materials
   giving complete details on the design and analysis of a simulation
   experiment, the simulation code, and the MISR data used are available
   on-line.}},

Abstract = {{Mexico has diverse gene pools of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)
   that have resulted from extended domestication and diversification
   processes, but are poorly documented in terms of fruit quality. To
   evaluate the physical, chemical and nutritional quality of wild tomato
   fruits (L. esculentum var. cerasiforme Dunal), 17 fruit samples were
   collected from eight municipalities in Oaxaca State, Mexico. Seeds from
   each sample were planted, following a randomized block design with three
   replications, under greenhouse conditions during Spring-Summer 2009.
   From each experimental plot, a sample of fruits (all fully red, firm and
   healthy) was analyzed for content of lycopene, vitamin C, soluble
   solids, pH, sugars, titratable acidity, and chromatic coordinates L{*},
   a{*} and b{*}. According to a principal components analysis, the content
   of lycopene, soluble solids, pH, sugars, titratable acidity and color
   parameters were the most important traits for describing fruit
   variability. The 17 accessions were classified into three groups by a
   cluster analysis. Differences (P < 0.05) were found among clusters and
   among accessions for all variables. Accessions L-063 and L-073, both
   from San Bias Atempa, stood out for their lycopene content on fresh
   weight (26.8 and 28.2 mg 100 g(-1)), as well as on dry weight (368.1 y
   343.9 mg 100 g(-1)). For vitamin C, accessions L-074 from Santiago
   Nuyoo, L-076, L-077, L-078 and L-079 from San Bias Atempa, and L-080
   from Nejapa de Madero, stood out with more than 15 mg 100 g(-1). Color

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of the category of unclassified renal
   cell carcinoma (URCC) on survival following nephrectomy.
   METHODS Patients with clear cell RCC (ccRCC, n = 3048) and URCC (n = 38)
   were identified. Patients with URCC were matched 4:1 with ccRCC patients
   based on year of surgery, symptoms at presentation, tumor size, stage,
   regional lymph node involvement, metastases, grade, coagulative tumor
   necrosis, and sarcomatoid differentiation. Survival was estimated using
   the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between ccRCC and URCC patients
   using log-rank tests.
   RESULTS Patients with URCC were more likely to have regional lymph node
   involvement (P <.001), higher grade (P <.001), tumor necrosis (P <.001),
   and sarcomatoid differentiation (P <.001) as compared to patients with
   ccRCC. Overall survival was not significantly different between URCC and
   ccRCC patients in either the unmatched (P = .337) or matched (P = .345)
   cohorts. Cancer-specific survival was significantly worse for URCC
   patients compared with unmatched ccRCC patients (P = .020). However,
   this difference was not statistically significant when the URCC patients
   were compared with the matched cohort (P = .688). Distant
   metastases-free survival was somewhat worse for M0 URCC patients
   compared with unmatched M0 ccRCC patients (P = .063), but not in the
   matched cohort (P = .788).
   CONCLUSIONS Although URCC is more likely to present with advanced
   clinicopathologic features compared with ccRCC, no statistically
   significant differences in outcome were noted after adjusting for these
   features in a matched analysis. UROLOGY 76: 580-586, 2010. (c) 2010

Title = {{The armadillo repeat domain of Apc suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis}},
Journal = {{MAMMALIAN GENOME}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{9-10}},
Pages = {{450-457}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is known to act as a tumor
   suppressor gene in both sporadic and hereditary colorectal cancer by
   negatively regulating WNT signaling. Familial adenomatous polyposis
   (FAP) patients develop intestinal polyps due to the presence of a single
   germline mutation in APC. The severity of the FAP phenotype is a
   function of the position of the APC mutation, indicating a complex role
   for APC that extends beyond the canonical WNT pathway. APC encodes a
   large protein with multiple functional domains, including an armadillo
   repeat domain that has been linked to protein protein interactions. To
   determine the effect of the armadillo repeat domain on intestinal
   tumorigenesis, we generated a congenic mouse line (Apc(Delta 242))
   carrying a gene trap cassette between exons 7 and 8 of the murine Apc
   gene. Apc(Delta 242/+) mice express a truncated Apc product lacking the
   armadillo repeat domain as part of a fusion protein with beta-geo.
   Expression of the fusion product was confirmed by X-gal staining,
   ensuring that Apc(Delta 242) is not a null allele. In contrast,
   Apc(min/+) mice produce a truncated Apc product that contains an intact
   armadillo repeat domain. On the C57BL/6J background, Apc(Delta 242/+)
   mice develop more polyps than do Apc(min/+) mice along the entire length
   of the small intestine; however, polyps were significantly smaller in
   Apc(Delta 242/+) mice. In addition, polyp multiplicity in Apc(Delta
   242/+) mice is affected by polymorphisms between inbred strains. These
   data suggest that the armadillo repeat domain of the Apc protein
   suppresses tumor initiation in the murine intestine while also promoting
   tumor growth.}},

Abstract = {{Background/aims
   To evaluate the association between demographical features, serum ALT
   and HBV DNA and the prevalence of significant fibrosis and inflammation
   on liver biopsy in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
   Methods
   In this cross-sectional study of patients on St Vincent's Hospital HBV
   database, patients were classified into three groups on the basis of
   HBeAg status and HBV DNA level and the prevalence of significant
   (F2/3/4) fibrosis and (A2/3) inflammation in each group was established.
   Patients were also divided into HBeAg-positive and -negative groups and
   examined for the prevalence of significant fibrosis/inflammation in the
   strata of HBV DNA and ALT. Predictors of significant fibrosis and
   inflammation in HBeAg-positive and -negative patients were examined by
   logistic regression.
   Results
   Three hundred and ninety four patients (HBeAg positive=198; HBeAg
   negative=196) with liver biopsy were identified. Fifty-eight percent of
   HBeAg-negative patients with HBV DNA > 25 000 IU/ml had F2/3/4 fibrosis.
   HBV DNA and F2/3/4 were positively correlated in HBeAg-negative patients
   {[}odds ratio (OR) 1.42, P=0.001] but inversely correlated in
   HBeAg-positive patients (OR 0.71, P=0.03). HBV DNA was an independent
   predictor of significant fibrosis in HBeAg negative (P=0.03) but not
   HBeAg-positive patients. In HBeAg-positive patients, age was the only
   predictor of significant fibrosis (P=0.001) and ALT the only predictor
   of significant inflammation (P=0.003). In the whole cohort there was a
   close positive association between inflammation and fibrosis.
   Conclusion
   Increasing levels of HBV DNA are associated with increasing prevalence
   of significant fibrosis only in patients with HBeAg-negative CHB.}},

   sigma(1)', of 0-70 MPa, as lateral strain was kept equal to zero. The
   samples were deposited as bioclastic facies in platform-top settings
   having paleo-water depths of <10-90 m. They were variably cemented with
   low-Mg calcite and five of the samples were dolomitized before burial to
   present depths of 39-635 m below sea floor with porosities of 8-46\%.
   Ten samples tested under dry conditions had up to 0.22\% strain at
   sigma(1)' = 50 MPa, whereas six samples tested saturated with brine,
   under drained conditions, had up to 0.33\% strain. The yield strength
   was reached in five of the plugs. The measured strains show an overall
   positive correlation with porosity. V-p ranges from 3640 to 5660 m/s and
   V-s from 1840 to 3530 m/s. Poisson coefficient is 0.20-0.33 and Young's
   modulus at 30 MPa ranged between 5 and 40 GPa. Water saturated samples
   had lower shear moduli and slightly higher P- to S-wave velocity ratios.
   Creep at constant stress was observed only in samples affected by pore
   collapse, indicating propagation of microcracks. Although deposited as
   loose carbonate sand and mud, the studied carbonates acquired reef-like
   petrophysical properties by early calcite and dolomite cementation. The
   small strains observed experimentally at 50 MPa indicate that little
   mechanical compaction would occur at deeper burial. However, as these
   rocks are unlikely to preserve their present high porosities to 4-5 km
   depth, further porosity loss would proceed mainly by chemical compaction
   and cementation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical in orientation, the focus of this article is the study of
   language teachers and teaching and builds on a body of research that has
   become increasingly influential since the mid-1990s. S. Borg's (2006)
   recent review of the field identifies a number of pathways with promise
   for new areas of research, but it also highlights the conceptual
   challenges that continue to exist in terms of moving the field forward.
   This article aims to engage with these themes and concerns by
   considering the potential of Vygotskian (Vygotsky, 1978, 1987)
   sociocultural theory as the basis for a conceptual framework to research
   language teacher cognition. The conceptual challenges addressed include
   the need for a theoretical orientation that recognizes the social,
   practical, and contextual dimension of cognition; an understanding of
   the teacher as a historical, sociological agent within larger (and
   political) contexts for practice; an awareness of the contradictions and
   tensions that arise within cognition as thinking and doing is mediated
   by and played out within the contexts that it exists; and an analytic
   framework commensurate with current empirical and methodological
   developments in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex and multifactorial disease. While
   large genome-wide association studies have had some success in
   identifying novel genetic risk factors for AD, case-control studies are
   less likely to uncover genetic factors that influence progression of
   disease. An alternative approach to identifying genetic risk for AD is
   the use of quantitative traits or endophenotypes. The use of
   endophenotypes has proven to be an effective strategy, implicating
   genetic risk factors in several diseases, including anemia, osteoporosis
   and heart disease. In this study we identify a genetic factor associated
   with the rate of decline in AD patients and present a methodology for
   identification of other such factors. We have used an established
   biomarker for AD, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau phosphorylated at
   threonine 181 (ptau(181)) levels as an endophenotype for AD, identifying
   a SNP, rs1868402, in the gene encoding the regulatory sub-unit of
   protein phosphatase B, associated with CSF ptau(181) levels in two
   independent CSF series (P(combined)=1.17 x 10(-05)). We show no
   association of rs1868402 with risk for AD or age at onset, but detected
   a very significant association with rate of progression of disease that
   is consistent in two independent series (P(combined)=1.71 x 10(-05)).
   Our analyses suggest that genetic variants associated with CSF ptau(181)
   levels may have a greater impact on rate of progression, while genetic
   variants such as APOE4, that are associated with CSF A beta(42) levels
   influence risk and onset but not the rate of progression. Our results
   also suggest that drugs that inhibit or decrease tau phosphorylation may
   slow cognitive decline in individuals with very mild dementia or delay
   the appearance of memory problems in elderly individuals with low CSF
   Ab42 levels. Finally, we believe genome-wide association studies of CSF
   tau/ptau(181) levels should identify novel genetic variants which will
   likely influence rate of progression of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Case Description A 10-year-old spayed female Corgi mix was examined for
   a 3-week history of lethargy and weight gain.
   Clinical Findings Physical examination findings included muffled heart
   sounds and a distended abdomen with a fluid wave on ballottement.
   Thoracic radiography revealed a globoid cardiac silhouette, and thoracic
   ultrasonography indicated pericardial effusion and a pedunculated mass
   originating from the right auricle.
   Treatment and Outcome Initial treatment consisted of pericardiocentesis.
   One week later, thoracoscopic right atrial mass resection was performed.
   No surgical complications were noted, and the dog was discharged
   approximately 28 hours after surgery. Results of histologic examination
   of the mass indicated a grade 2 hemangiosarcoma with incomplete margins.
   Treatment with doxorubicin was initiated 35 days after surgery. The dog
   survived for 177 days after mass resection, when it was euthanized
   because of complications related to metastatic disease.
   Clinical Relevance Findings suggested that thoracoscopic right atrial

Abstract = {{The Mailaka lava succession (central-western Madagascar) forms part of
   the Madagascar large igneous province and is characterized by basaltic
   to picritic basalt lava flows and minor evolved flows. In situ U-Pb
   dating of zircon in rhyodacites yields concordant ages of 89.7 +/- 1.4
   and 90.7 +/- 1.1 Ma. Therefore, the capping rhyodacitic unit of the
   Mailaka lava succession was emplaced just after the underlying basalt
   sequence (dated paleontologically at Coniacian-Turonian). Two
   geochemically different lava series are present. A transitional series
   ranging from picritic basalts to basalts has incompatible element
   abundances and Pb, Os, and Nd isotope ratios within the range of
   mid-ocean ridge basalts. In addition, the concentrations of
   platinum-group elements (Ir < 0.35 ng/g, Ru < 0.17 ng/g, Pd = 1.0-1.6
   ng/g) in the transitional basalts are generally lower than in basaltic
   lavas from oceanic plateaus (e.g., Ontong Java and Kerguelen) and other
   continental flood basalt provinces (e.g., Deccan and Etendeka). A
   tholeiitic series ranges from picritic basalts to rhyodacites and has
   relatively high concentrations of trace elements (e.g., Rb, Ba, Th, and
   light lanthanides) and the Pb-Sr-Nd and Os isotopic characteristic of
   magmas that have assimilated continental crust. The Pb isotope ratios of
   tholeiitic andesites indicate the involvement of a component highly
   depleted in radiogenic Pb, very likely old lower crust.
   Energy-constrained-assimilation-fractional-crystallization modeling
   indicates that the rhyodacites may be the result of similar to 25\%
   assimilation of upper continental crust, with a ratio between
   assimilated mass and subtracted solid of similar to 0.35. An andesite
   with low Pb isotope ratios may be the result of similar to 8\%
   assimilation of lower continental crust with a mass assimilated/mass
   accumulated ratio of similar to 0.1. Interaction of mantle-derived
   magmas with crustal lithologies of different age and evolutionary
   history thus occurred in this sector of the flood basalt province.
   Contamination of mantle-derived rocks by material of different crustal
   domains is a process also observed in other large igneous provinces,
   such as the Deccan Traps.}},

Abstract = {{The advance of exotic tree and shrub species is one of the main threats
   to conservation of the last relicts of natural grassland in South
   America; however, control actions in the region are still scarce and
   there are almost no evaluations of the recovery of natural ecosystems
   after removing invasive plants. Monitoring of the vegetation during the
   years after removal of invasive trees is critical in order to decide
   whether an active restoration strategy is necessary. The recovery of
   montane grassland four years after the control of a dense invasion of
   Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) is described in this study. Experimental
   clearing areas were followed during four years and compared to grassland
   controls. Variation was seen in the levels of recovery in function of
   the proximity of sectors of grassland that are free of invasive species
   and/or the density of invasive trees before control. Native species
   slowly replaced many exotic herbs that had appeared as pioneers, there
   was low recruitment of pine seedlings in spite of the quantity of seeds
   from trees that surrounded the clearings, and species richness and
   diversity were restored, including cover of the typical grasses in the
   controls. Recovery of grassland after felling was shown to be successful
   and does not seem to be seed limited if tree removal occurs early in the
   invasion process.}},

Abstract = {{Colon carcinoma is one of the common malignant tumors and has high
   morbidity and mortality in the world. Pigment epithelial-derived factor
   (PEDF) has been found to be the most potent natural inhibitor of
   angiogenesis and PEDF gene has been extensively used for the therapy of
   tumors, which suggests a potential approach to the therapy of colon
   carcinoma. However, the transfer of PEDF gene largely depends on the
   effective gene delivery systems. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)
   nanoparticles (PLGANPs) have been extensively used for gene therapy due
   to its low-toxicity, biocompatibility and biodegradability, due to its
   potential to be an excellent carrier of the PEDF gene. We investigated
   the effect of PEDF gene loaded in PLGA nanoparticles (PEDF-PLGANPs) on
   the mouse colon carcinoma cells (CT26s) in vitro and in vivo. Blank
   PLGANPs (bPLGANPs) showed lower cytotoxicity than PEI to the CT26s. In
   vitro, PEDF-PLGANPs directly induced CT26 apoptosis and inhibit human
   umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation. In vivo,
   PEDF-PLGANPs inhibited CT26 tumors growth by inducing CT26 apoptosis,
   decreasing MVD and inhibiting angiogenesis. Our present study
   demonstrates the inhibitory effect of PEDF-PLGANPs on the growth of
   CT26s in vitro and in vivo for the first time. PLGANP-mediated PEDF gene
   could provide an innovative strategy for the therapy of colon carcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{Nearest neighbor queries in high-dimensional space are important in
   various applications. One-dimensional mapping is an efficient indexing
   method to speed up the k-nearest neighbor search, which can transform a
   high-dimensional point into a single-dimensional value indexed by a
   B+-tree. In this paper, we present a new one-dimensional indexing scheme
   based on extended B+-tree for k-nearest neighbor search in
   high-dimensional space. We first partition the high-dimensional dataset
   and perform Principal Component Analysis on each partition. The distance
   of each point to the center of the partition is indexed using a B+-tree,
   and the projection on the first principal component of each point is
   embedded into leaf node of the B+-tree. In the query, a new filter
   strategy according to the spatial relationship between the query point
   and the axis determined by the first principal component is applied to
   improve the query performance. We also present a novel k-nearest
   neighbor search algorithm which can guarantee the accuracy of query
   results. Extensive experiments have been indicative of the effectiveness
   of our approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Exercise training attenuates anaphylactic venoconstriction in rat
   perfused liver, but does not affect anaphylactic hypotension in
   conscious rats}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Exercise training attenuates circulatory shock due to haemorrhage,
   endotoxin or heatstroke. However, it remains unknown whether exercise
   training attenuates anaphylactic shock. Hepatic venoconstriction is
   involved in rat anaphylactic hypotension. In the present study, we
   determined the effects of exercise training on both anaphylaxis-induced
   segmental venoconstriction in rat perfused livers and systemic
   anaphylaxis in conscious rats. The role of nitric oxide (NO) in the
   effect of exercise on the venoconstriction of perfused livers was also
   examined.
   2. Rats were subjected to running training on a motorized treadmill for
   4 weeks. Two weeks prior to the anaphylaxis experiment, Sprague-Dawley
   rats were actively sensitized with the antigen ovalbumin. In isolated
   livers perfused portally with blood, the portal venous pressure (P(pv))
   and sinusoidal pressure were measured to determine the pre- and
   post-sinusoidal resistances (R(pre) and R(post), respectively). In
   conscious rats, systemic arterial pressure (SAP) and P(pv) were
   determined.
   3. In the perfused livers of sedentary rats, antigen administration led
   to a predominant presinusoidal constriction, as evidenced by 4.6- and
   1.7-fold increases in R(pre) and R(post), respectively. The
   anaphylaxis-induced increase in R(pre) was significantly attenuated by
   24\% by exercise training. Inhibition of NO synthase with
   NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (100 mu mol/L) 10 min prior to the
   injection of antigen enhanced anaphylactic venoconstriction, but did not
   alter the effect of exercise training on the increase in R(pre). In
   contrast, exercise training did not attenuate either anaphylactic
   hypotension or portal hypertension in conscious rats.
   4. In conclusion, exercise training attenuates the anaphylaxis-induced
   presinusoidal constriction in rat isolated perfused livers, independent
   of NO production. However, this action is not evident in conscious rats
   and exercise training does not affect anaphylactic hypotension in
   conscious rats.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION}},

Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background. Methods used by dental practitioners to diagnose and treat
   dentin hypersensitivity are not well documented. The authors conducted a
   survey of dentists in the Northwest Practice-based REsearch
   Collaborative in Evidence-based DENTistry (PRECEDENT) to ascertain the
   treatment methods they used.
   Methods. Via an Internet survey, the authors collected data regarding
   methods used for diagnosis and treatment of dentin hypersensitivity from
   209 Northwest PRECEDENT dentists.
   Results. The PRECEDENT dentists indicated that they most often used
   fluoride varnishes and gels, advice regarding toothbrushing and diet,
   bonding agents, restorative materials and glutaraldehyde/2-hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate (HEMA) to treat dentin hypersensitivity. They reported that
   the most successful treatments were fluorides, glutaraldehyde/HEMA,
   bonding agents, potassium nitrates and restorative treatments; they
   considered observation, advice regarding toothbrushing and diet and
   laser therapy to be the least successful. Dentists listed fluorides,
   calcium phosphates, glutaraldehyde/HEMA and bonding agents as the
   treatments most desirable for inclusion in a future randomized clinical
   trial of dental hypersensitivity treatments.
   Conclusions. Dentists rely on patients to assess the severity of dentin
   hypersensitivity. Modalities for the diagnosis and treatment of
   hypersensitivity are diverse. Methods used to diagnose and treat dentin
   hypersensitivity in practice are challenging to justify.
   Clinical Implications. Practitioners should be aware of the diversity of
   methods available for diagnosing and treating dentin hypersensitivity as
   they manage the care of their patients with this condition.}},

   Imaging Scoring Method-Preliminary Assessment}},
Journal = {{RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{256}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{863-869}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess a simplified scoring method (Simplified Rheumatoid
   Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score {[}SAMIS]) developed to
   shorten interpretation time, while retaining both correlation with
   Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (RAMRIS) and same
   or better intra-and interreader reliability.
   Materials and Methods: Ethics board approval and written patient consent
   were obtained. The study was HIPAA compliant. Thirty-eight patients with
   rheumatoid arthritis and 20 patients with no or early unclassified
   arthritis underwent magnetic resonance imaging of both wrists and hands.
   RAMRIS was used to evaluate erosions (scale, 0-10), edema (scale, 0-3),
   and synovitis (scale, 0-3). SAMIS assessed only one hand and was based
   on the radiographic Simple Erosion Narrowing Score, thus reducing the
   number of study areas from 116 to 36. Erosions were scored with a scale
   from 1 to 10. Edema and synovitis were, respectively, scored with scales
   from 0 to 1 and 0 to 2. SAMIS correlation with RAMRIS was tested by
   using the Spearman test. Last, the intra-and interobserver
   reproducibility of both scores were calculated.
   Results: SAMIS was closely correlated with RAMRIS for the entire series
   (r = 0.91, 0.79, and 0.94, respectively, for erosion, edema, and
   synovitis), as well as in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (r = 0.93,
   0.81, and 0.92) and those with no or unclassified arthritis (r = 0.83,
   0.73, and 0.94). The time needed to assess examination results with
   RAMRIS ranged from 5 to 20 minutes (13 minutes 6 3.90 {[}standard
   deviation]), whereas it ranged from 2 to 7 minutes (5 minutes +/- 1.45)
   with SAMIS. For each of the three features (erosion, edema, and
   synovitis), intraobserver agreement (RAMRIS: k = 0.67, 0.94, 0.81,
   respectively; SAMIS: k = 0.66, 1.0, 0.91) and interobserver agreement
   (RAMRIS: k = 0.61, 0.58, 0.74, respectively; SAMIS: k = 0.59, 0.81,
   0.81) were good to excellent.
   Conclusion: This simplified reproducible scoring scheme could be used to
   monitor joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. (C) RSNA, 2010}},

   controlled with the use of massive chemical products, contributing to
   the development of resistance and decreasing the insect control
   efficiency. The control of dipterans with bioinsecticides based on
   Bacillus thuringiensis has been satisfactory, due to the production of
   insecticidal proteins denominated Cry (crystal), Cyt (cytolytic) toxins
   and Chi (chitinase), and to the synergistic effects among them. The
   present work aimed to select B. thuringiensis isolates efficient against
   A. aegypti larvae. A bacterial collection containing 1,073 isolates of
   B. thuringiensis, obtained from different locations of Brazilian
   territory, had the DNA isolated and submitted to PCR amplifications
   using specific primers for cry4Aa, cry4Ba, cry11Aa, cty11Ba, cyt1Aa,
   cyt1Ab, cyt2Aa and chi genes. For the LC50 and LC90 determination, the
   entomopathogenic isolates were evaluated by selective and quantitative
   bioassays. Only 45 isolates (4.2\%) presented amplicons for the cry and
   cyt genes. The chi gene sequence was detected in 25 (54.3\%) of those
   isolates. From the 45 isolates submitted to the selective bioassays, 13
   caused 100\% mortality of A. aegypti larvae. The identification of cry,
   cyt and chi genes of B. thuringiensis and the toxicity analysis on A.
   aegypti led to the selection of a set of isolates that have the
   potential to be used in the formulation of new bioinsecticides.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal mortality has been established as one of the priority problems
   of public health, directly affecting women in the pregnant puerperal
   cycle and belonging to underprivileged social classes. Considering this
   situation, the aim of the present study was to identify associations
   between the race of women living in the state of Paraiba and age,
   educational level and type of death of women who died of maternal death
   in the period 2000 to 2004. This cross-sectional study used as a source
   of data declarations of 109 maternal deaths. Bivariate and multivariate
   statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the association between
   variables using multiple logistic regression. The odds ratio to
   investigate the association between variables was calculated. It was
   observed that there was no statistical significance between race and age
   variables or with educational level, but there was significant evidence
   that non-white women from Paraiba were more likely to die from direct
   obstetric death than white women, (OR = 3.55; IC: 1,20-10,5). The
   results showed that the risk of maternal mortality in Paraiba was higher
   among non-white women, revealing an important expression of social
   inequality.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to study in field, the behavior of five
   cultivars of garlic from the tissue culture and establish a maximum time
   of conventional multiplication of each cultivar. The work was conducted
   in the experimental area Olericultura Sector of the Federal University
   of Lavras using the following cultivars: Amarante, Gigante Roxo,
   Gravata, Gigante de Lavinia and Gigante Roxao. Each of these cultivars
   have two origins: plant tissue culture and conventional propagation. For
   each year was adopted a design in randomized blocks with ten treatments
   considered (five cultivars from conventional multiplication and the same
   cultivars from plant tissue culture) with three replications. An annual
   index was calculated as the difference in production between the two
   roots of each cultivar is considered to control the variety of
   conventional origin. The analysis of variance was applied in the
   respective indices to adjust to a polynomial regression model. It was
   concluded that the cultivars Gigante Roxo, Gravata, Gigante de Lavinia e
   Gigante Roxao from multiplication by tissue culture, can be multiplied
   conventionally by at least nine consecutive years. It is suggested that
   cultivar Amarante be indexed for viruses and is subject to further

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Isolated pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcomas
   occur in 20-50\% of these (the issue is about metastases, not lung
   cancer) patients, and 70\% of these patients will present disease
   limited only to the lungs. Surgical resection is well accepted as a
   standard approach to treat metastases from soft tissue sarcomas isolated
   in the lungs, and many studies investigating this technique have
   reported an overall 5-year survival ranging from 30-40\%. The most
   consistent predictor of survival in these patients is complete
   resection. The aim of the present study was to determine the
   demographics and clinical treatment-related variables associated with
   long-term (90-month) overall survival in patients with lung metastases
   undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy from soft tissue sarcomas.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted in the
   Thoracic Surgery Department with lung metastases who underwent
   thoracotomy for resection following treatment of the primary tumor. Data
   regarding primary tumor features, demographics, treatment, and outcome
   were collected.
   RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two thoracotomies and 273 nodules were
   resected from 77 patients with previously treated soft tissue sarcomas.
   The median follow-up time of all patients was 36.7 months (range: 10-138
   months). The postoperative complication rate was 9.1\%, and the 30-day
   mortality rate was 0\%. The 90-month overall survival rate for all
   patients was 34.7\%. Multivariate analysis identified the following
   independent prognostic factors for overall survival: the number of
   metastases resected, the disease-free interval, and the number of
   complete resections.
   CONCLUSION: These results confirm that lung metastasectomy is a safe and
   potentially curative procedure for patients with treated primary tumors.
   A select group of patients can achieve long-term survival after lung
   resection.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the effect of using computer-aided detection (CAD) in
   second-read mode on readers' accuracy in interpreting computed
   tomographic (CT) colonographic images.
   Materials and Methods: The contributing institutions performed the
   examinations under approval of their local institutional review board,
   with waiver of informed consent, for this HIPAA-compliant study. A
   cohort of 100 colonoscopy-proved cases was used: In 52 patients with
   findings positive for polyps, 74 polyps of 6 mm or larger were observed
   in 65 colonic segments; in 48 patients with findings negative for
   polyps, no polyps were found. Nineteen blinded readers interpreted each
   case at two different times, with and without the assistance of a
   commercial CAD system. The effect of CAD was assessed in segment-level
   and patient-level receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
   analyses.
   Results: Thirteen (68\%) of 19 readers demonstrated higher accuracy with
   CAD, as measured with the segment-level area under the ROC curve (AUC).
   The readers' average segment-level AUC with CAD (0.758) was
   significantly greater (P = .015) than the average AUC in the unassisted
   read (0.737). Readers' per-segment, per-patient, and per-polyp
   sensitivity for all polyps of 6 mm or larger was higher (P <
   .011,.007,.005, respectively) for readings with CAD compared with
   unassisted readings (0.517 versus 0.465, 0.521 versus 0.466, and 0.477
   versus 0.422, respectively). Sensitivity for patients with at least one
   large polyp of 10 mm or larger was also higher (P < .047) with CAD than
   without (0.777 versus 0.743). Average reader sensitivity also improved
   with CAD by more than 0.08 for small adenomas. Use of CAD reduced
   specificity of readers by 0.025 (P = .05).
   Conclusion: Use of CAD resulted in a significant improvement in overall
   reader performance. CAD improves reader sensitivity when measured per
   segment, per patient, and per polyp for small polyps and adenomas and
   also reduces specificity by a small amount. (C) RSNA, 2010}},

Abstract = {{Methods. A retrospective French multicentre study included patients with
   a diagnosis of JIA according to the ILAR criteria who developed IBD
   while under anti-TNF-alpha therapy before 18 years of age. Intestinal
   biopsies were collected and reviewed by the same pathologist.
   Results. Eight patients were included. They had been treated with
   etanercept from 11 to 78 months before IBD onset. Gastro-intestinal
   symptoms included abdominal pain (six patients), diarrhoea (four
   patients), anorexia (four patients), anal abscess (three patients) and
   oral ulcers (one patient). Five patients presented with Crohn's disease
   (CD) and three with indeterminate IBD, of whom four had severe
   pancolitis. Clinical remission of IBD was obtained in all patients after
   discontinuation of etanercept and initiation of IBD-specific therapy,
   including infliximab in six patients.
   Conclusion. IBD must be suspected in JIA patients treated with
   etanercept who develop intestinal symptoms, including anal abscess. This
   series raises the possibility of a relationship between etanercept
   therapy and the occurrence of IBD in a subset of patients with JIA.}},

Abstract = {{Conditional goal setting is the tendency for people to see attainment of
   their future personal goals as necessary for their well-being. It has
   been argued that this represents an unhealthy way of relating to one's
   goals, as well as being particularly problematic when goals are
   perceived as unlikely. High conditional goal setting has been found to
   be related to depression and to hopelessness. The present study examined
   conditional goal setting in deliberate self-harm, where problematic
   thinking about the future is very prominent. A group of individuals
   attending hospital for a recent episode of deliberate self-harm (N = 25)
   were compared with controls attending hospital for minor injuries (N =
   25) as well as a psychologically disordered but non-suicidal control
   group (N = 25). Participants generated goals and rated goal likelihood,
   the extent to which those goals were seen as necessary for their future
   well-being (conditional goal setting), and also the extent to which the
   goals were seen as sufficient for their future well-being (goal
   sufficiency). Deliberate self-harm patients showed a higher degree of
   both conditional goal setting and goal sufficiency than did both of the
   other groups, further confirming the idea of painful engagement with
   personal goals, rather than disengagement, as characterising deliberate
   self-harm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The micro paddy lysimeter (MPL) was developed and evaluated for its

   Field Museum Honmachi of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology,
   Japan. For the physical characteristics of the hardpan layer, parameters
   such as thickness, and soil aggregate size, affecting the percolation
   rate were studied. For the plow layer, two types of plow soils, sieved
   and un-sieved soils were compared. The sieved soil plow layer was
   produced by mixing air-dried soils of different aggregate sizes of D >
   9.50, 9.50 a parts per thousand yen D > 4.75, 4.75 a parts per thousand
   yen D > 2.0 mm and D a parts per thousand currency sign 2.0 mm at 47.1,
   19.5, 20.6, and 12.8\%, respectively. The un-sieved plow layer soil was
   directly used after collecting from the field. Inert tracer was applied
   to ponding water with controlled boundary conditions to evaluate the
   reproducibility of the soil hydraulic characteristics. HYDRUS-1D was
   used to evaluate the movement of bromide tracer in the MPL. The proposed
   conditions of the MPL were that the hardpan layer can be made from soil
   aggregates smaller than 0.425 mm with 2 cm thickness and that the plow
   layer can be prepared with sieved or un-sieved soils. With these
   conditions, the obtained results proved that MPLs can be a useful tool
   to simulate solute transport in paddy environment.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced survival and future reproduction due to of current reproduction
   is a trade-off known as the cost of reproduction. Surprisingly, only a
   few studies have assessed the cost of reproduction in arthropod disease
   vectors, despite its effect on longevity, and thus on vectorial
   capacity. We evaluated the cost of reproduction on survival of Anopheles
   gambiae Giles by comparing mosquitoes that were denied exposure to the
   other sex, hereafter named virgins, and those that were allowed exposure
   to the other sex and mating, hereafter named mated. Merely 6 d of
   exposure to females with mating activity reduced male survival from a
   median of 17 d in virgins to 15 d in mated, indicating that male mating
   cost is substantial. The increase in mortality of mated males began
   several days after the exposure to females ended, indicating that mating
   is not associated with immediate mortality risk. Notably, body size was
   negatively correlated with male mortality in mated males, but not in
   virgins. The rate of insemination declined after 4 d of exposure to
   females, indicating that male mating capacity is limited and further
   supporting the hypothesis that mating is costly for males. Consistent
   with previous studies, female survival on sugar alone (median = 16 d)
   was shorter than on blood and sugar (median = 19 d), regardless if she
   was mated or virgin. Overall, survival of mated females was lower than
   that of virgins on a diet of blood and sugar, but no difference was
   found on a diet of sugar only. However, the cost of reproduction in
   females remains ambiguous because the difference in survival between
   virgin mid mated females was driven by the difference between virgin
   (median = 19 d) and uninseminated females exposed to males (median = 17
   d), rather than between virgin and inseminated females (median = 19 d).
   Accordingly, sperm and seminal fluid, egg development, and oviposition
   have negligible cost in terms of female survival. Only exposure to males
   without insemination decreased female survival. Nonetheless, if exposure
   to males under natural conditions is also associated with reduced
   survival, it might explain why females remain monogamous.}},

   an isothermal effective stress-strain equation based on the logarithmic

Abstract = {{Thyroid hormone (TH) affects diverse biological processes and can exert
   its effects through both gene regulation via binding the nuclear TH
   receptors (TRs) and non-genomic actions via binding to cell surface and
   cytoplasmic proteins. The critical importance of TH in vertebrate
   development has long been established, ranging from the formation of
   human cretins to the blockage of frog metamorphosis due the TH
   deficiency. How TH affects vertebrate development has been difficult to
   study in mammals due to the complications associated with the
   uterus-enclosed mammalian embryos. Anuran metamorphosis offers a unique
   opportunity to address such an issue. Using Xenopus as a model, we and
   others have shown that the expression of TRs and their
   heterodimerization partners RXRs (9-cis retinoic acid receptors)
   correlates temporally with metamorphosis in different organs in two
   highly related species, Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis. In vivo
   molecular studies have shown that TR and RXR are bound to the TH
   response elements (TREs) located in TH-inducible genes in developing
   tadpoles of both species. More importantly, transgenic studies in X.
   laevis have demonstrated that TR function is both necessary and
   sufficient for mediating the metamorphic effects of TH. Thus, the
   non-genomic effects of TH have little or no roles during metamorphosis
   and likely during vertebrate development in general. Published by

Abstract = {{Experimental and clinical data support a growth inhibitory role for HER4
   in breast cancer. Clinically HER4 expression is extinguished during
   breast tumorigenesis supporting a tumor suppressor function for HER4,
   however, a molecular mechanism to explain the selective loss of HER4
   expression has remained elusive. Epigenetic mechanisms, for example,
   aberrant gene promoter hypermethylation, have been shown to ablate tumor
   suppressor gene expression in breast carcinomas. We identified a CpG
   island within the HER4 promoter and show by pyrosequencing of
   bisulfite-treated DNA an inverse correlation between HER4 expression and
   the extent of promoter methylation. Treatment of the HER4-negative BT20
   cell line with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
   (DAC)-enhanced HER4 expression, confirming a role for DNA methylation in
   suppressed HER4 expression. DAC treatment to reactive HER4 expression in
   combination with the HER4 ligand heregulin-beta 1 (HRG) resulted in
   apoptosis of BT20 cells providing a novel therapeutic strategy for
   triple-negative tumors. The BT20 cells were rescued from apoptosis when
   preincubated with HER4 small interfering RNA, thereby confirming a role
   for HER4 in DAC/HRG-induced apoptosis. We verified HER4 promoter
   methylation in primary breast carcinomas and detected a significant
   increase in HER4 promoter methylation in HER4-negative breast tumors (P
   < 0.001). Furthermore, increased levels of HER4 promoter methylation
   were significantly associated with worse patient prognosis (P = 0.0234).
   Taken together, our data support a tumor suppressor function for HER4,
   which is epigenetically suppressed in breast tumors through promoter
   hypermethylation. Oncogene (2010) 29, 5214-5219;

Abstract = {{Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is the canonical greedy algorithm for
   sparse approximation. In this paper we demonstrate that the restricted
   isometry property (RIP) can be used for a very straightforward analysis
   of OMP. Our main conclusion is that the RIP of order K + 1 (with
   isometry constant delta < 1/3 root K) is sufficient for OMP to exactly
   recover any K-sparse signal. The analysis relies on simple and intuitive
   observations about OMP and matrices which satisfy the RIP. For
   restricted classes of K-sparse signals (those that are highly
   compressible), a relaxed bound on the isometry constant is also
   established. A deeper understanding of OMP may benefit the analysis of
   greedy algorithms in general. To demonstrate this, we also briefly
   revisit the analysis of the regularized OMP (ROMP) algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In the North of Europe, club membership is higher than in the South, but
   the frequency of contacts with friends, relatives and neighbors is
   lower. We link this fact to another one: the low geographical mobility
   rates in the South of Europe relative to the North.
   To interpret these facts, we build a model of local social capital and
   mobility. Investing in local ties is rational when workers do not expect
   to move to another region. We find that observationally close
   individuals may take different paths characterized by high local social
   capital, low mobility and high unemployment, vs. low social capital,
   high propensity to move and higher employment probability. Employment
   protection reinforces the accumulation of local social capital and thus
   reduces mobility.
   European data supports the theory: within a country and at the
   individual level, more social capital is associated with lower mobility.

   increased with available cobble substrate and shallow pool habitat.
   Preferred summer microhabitat included depths between 20 and 80 cm,
   velocities less than 0.1 m/s, and cover rocks with surface areas between
   200 and 1400 cm(2). Although other variables may affect presence, tuxedo
   darter distribution was limited by the availability of suitable habitat.
   Due to environmental variation in annual flow regimes, our models
   describe habitat use during drought and during above average flows.

Abstract = {{Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) represents a rare but aggressive and
   lethal form of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and frequently with
   HER-2 neu overexpressed or amplified. We retrospectively identified 16
   newly diagnosed HER-2/neu-positive IBC patients who were treated with
   preoperative trastuzumab. We determined the pathological complete
   response rate (pCR) when trastuzumab was added to preoperative
   chemotherapy in patients with HER2/neupositive IBC. Furthermore, we
   assessed the expression of CXCR4 in metastatic recurrence sites. Ten
   patients (62.5\%) achieved a pCR. Six patients (37.5\%) achieved a
   partial response. Median follow-up of all patients was 24.2 months. Four
   (25\%) patients have experienced a progression, of which three were in
   the brain. Two-year progression-free survival was 59.4\% (95\% CI
   35-100). High expression of CXCR4 was detected in the brain metastases.
   We conclude that in spite of high pCR rates among women with
   HER-2/neu-positive IBC treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based
   regimens the outcome remains dismal and brain recurrences are frequent.
   CXCR4 may represent a novel therapeutic target.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To describe a population of children diagnosed with
   Kawasaki's disease (1(13) in pediatric rheumatology centers of Rio de
   Janeiro, Brazil, defining the magnitude of the delay period in
   diagnosing KD and initiating treatment due to confusion with common
   childhood febrile illnesses and the impact of this delay on the
   frequency of coronary sequels. Methods: Data analysis from hospital
   records summarized in a dedicated form, including name, gender, age,
   date of first recorded clinical signs, date of admission to the
   specialty service, information about symptoms, clinical evolution,
   intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) use and coronary sequels. Results: Of
   125 patients, 63\% were males. 40\% were under 2 years at diagnosis.
   Average lapse between earliest signs and KD diagnosis was 12 days (mean
   fever duration, 14 d). Only 22.4\% had a diagnosis of KD before entering
   the specialty service. For the remainder, initial hypotheses included:
   bacterial (60\%) and viral infections (12\%), rheumatological diseases
   (4\%) and adverse vaccination reactions (1.6\%). Hence, prevalent
   febrile illnesses of childhood were major confounding factors. For
   records (85.6\%) mentioning treatment, 46.7\% reported IVIG treatment,
   beginning after day 10 in 23 cases (21.5\%). 20 patients (16\%)
   presented coronary sequels, 9 of which were diagnosed late, including 3
   given IVIG after day 10, and 6 given no IVIG. We found no significant
   association between the frequency of coronary sequels and: a) sex; b)
   age; c) clinical criteria; d) initiation of IVIG treatment (before or
   after day 10). Conclusions: Common febrile illnesses of childhood often
   confound the diagnosis of KD.}},

Abstract = {{Despite good clinical results, the mechanisms of action of spinal cord
   stimulation (SCS) for the treatment of chronic refractory neuropathic
   pain have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, the effects of
   SCS were assessed on various neurophysiological parameters in a series
   of 20 patients, successfully treated by SCS for mostly unilateral,
   drug-resistant lower limb pain due to failed back surgery syndrome.
   Plantar sympathetic skin response (SSR), F-wave and somatosensory-evoked
   potentials (P40-SEP) to tibial nerve stimulation, H-reflex of soleus
   muscle, and nociceptive flexion (RIII) reflex to sural nerve stimulation
   were recorded at the painful lower limb. The study included two
   recording sets while SCS was switched `ON' or `OFF' for 1 h. Significant
   changes in `ON' condition were as follows: SSR amplitude, H-reflex
   threshold, and RIII-reflex threshold and latency were increased, whereas
   SSR latency, F-wave latency, H-reflex amplitude, P40-SEP amplitude, and
   RIII-reflex area were reduced. Analgesia induced by SCS mainly
   correlated with RIII attenuation, supporting a real analgesic efficacy
   of the procedure. This study showed that SCS is able to inhibit both
   nociceptive (Rill-reflex) and non-nociceptive (P40-SEP, H-reflex)
   myelinated sensory afferents at segmental spinal or supraspinal level,
   and to increase cholinergic sympathetic skin activities (SSR
   facilitation). Complex modulating effects can be produced by SCS on
   various neural circuits, including a broad inhibition of both noxious
   and innocuous sensory information processing. (C) 2010 International

Abstract = {{The chemical stability of ceftriaxone for injection reconstituted with
   water was studied at different storage conditions by a validated
   stability-indicating ion-pair liquid chromatographic method. The study
   was performed on ceftriaxone for injection samples obtained from two
   pharmaceutical laboratories, at three different temperatures: 23 degrees
   C +/- 2 degrees C, + 8 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C and - 20 degrees C +/-
   0.5 degrees C, over 26 days, 55 days, and 76 days, respectively.
   Chromatographic separation was achieved on a RP-18 column, using a
   mobile phase consisting of 250 mL acetonitrile, 50 mL phosphate buffer
   (pH 7.4; 0.1M), 3.2 g tetrabutylammonium bromide made LIP to a volume of
   1 L with water, at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min(-1) and UV detection at 260
   nm. The stability-indicating capability of the assay was established by
   forced degradation studies under hydrolysis, high temperature and
   photolysis. The developed method was specific, stability indicating,
   accurate and precise for ceftriaxone determination. At room temperature
   and at + 8 degrees C the degradation of ceftriaxone followed first-order
   kinetics and the samples were chemically stable for at least 4 and 41
   days respectively. At - 20 degrees C the concentration of all samples
   remained higher than 90\% of the original concentration. Degradation of
   ceftriaxone was higher at room temperature; therefore lower storage
   temperatures improved the chemical stability of ceftriaxone for

Abstract = {{It was monitored variables related to production and structure of oat
   (Avena strigosa Schreb) and ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) pastures
   managed at four sward heights (10, 20, 30, and 40 cm) on continuous
   grazing with variable stocking (put and take). It was used crossbred
   beef steers at approximately 10 months of age and an average initial
   weight 190 kg in a complete random block design with three replicates.
   The type of sward height distribution in six different sample dates as
   well as the forage dry mass prediction through sward heights were
   investigated. Forage mass linearly increased according to the sward
   height: for each 1-cm increase of the height above 10 cm, there was an
   approximately 107 kg DM/ha addition in the forage mass. There was no
   effect of sward height on the accumulation rate (55.8 kg DM/ha) neither
   on the dry matter total production (8,210 kg of DM/ha). Frequency
   distributions fitted to the normal model in only one out of the 96
   analyzed data series. Gamma type distribution was the one that was the
   most frequently adjusted to sward height data, however, once grazing was
   started, pasture heterogeneity was so high that height distribution did
   not fit any of the investigated models. It is possible to estimate
   forage dry mass on the pasture by its average height so it is suggested
   to establish variable heights over the grazing cycle aiming to manage
   the heterogeneity caused by the animal.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophyllum commune is the only mushroom-forming fungus in which
   targeted gene deletions by homologous recombination have been reported.
   However, these deletions occur with a low frequency. To overcome this,
   the ku80 gene of S. commune was deleted. This gene is involved in the
   nonhomologous end-joining system for DNA repair. The delta ku80 strain
   was not affected in growth and development. However, the transformation
   efficiency was reduced up to 100-fold. This was accompanied by a strong
   increase in the relative number of transformants with a homologous
   integration of a knockout construct. Genes sc15, jmj3 and pri2 were

Abstract = {{In the complex practice of today's blended learning, educators need to
   be able to evaluate both online and face-to-face communication in order
   to get the full picture of what is going on in blended learning
   scenarios. The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability and
   feasibility of a practical instrument for analysing face-to-face
   communication that is in alignment with tools for analysing online
   communication. We examined whether an existing coding scheme for online
   communication could be modified to evaluate face-to-face communication.
   We investigated the reliability, validity and usability of a modified
   version of the Transcript Analysis Tool (TAT) in analysing communication
   among students during small-group sessions comprising presentations by
   students and discussion. The modified TAT proved to be effective in
   obtaining a detailed description of students' participation in the
   communication and of the focus of the communication. Evaluation was more
   efficient when direct video analysis was used than when a transcript of
   the same video was analysed. Direct analysis took about 2 h for 20 min
   of video recording and had an inter-rater reliability of kappa = 0.56.
   The modified TAT appears to be an effective and efficient instrument to
   analyse face-to-face communication in small group sessions. Its combined
   use with an evaluation instrument for online learning may create a
   powerful evaluation instrument for blended learning. Further studies are
   needed to establish the value of such an instrument. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The isothermal section of the Mg-Zn-Si system at 300 degrees C was
   determined through the characterization of annealed samples by means of
   scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis and X-ray
   powder diffraction. No ternary phases have been detected in this system
   at 300 degrees C. The Mg2Si phase was found to dissolve about 2 at.\%
   Zn, changing its lattice parameter from a = 0.6347(4) nm to a = 0.6335
   (4) mu; the other binary phases do not form detectable solid solutions
   with the third element. Based on the results obtained on samples
   subjected to different thermal treatments a U-type invariant equilibrium
   is proposed to occur in the solid state at 350 < T < 380 degrees C.
   Mg-Zn-Si powder blends of two different compositions were mechanically
   alloyed in a planetary ball mill. In both cases the milling process
   promoted solid state reactions between the constituent elements, leading

Abstract = {{CONTEXT: Early sexual initiation is associated with elevated teenage
   pregnancy and STD risk, yet little is known about the prevalence and
   correlates of sexual behavior among young adolescents. Better
   information is needed to guide interventions to prevent early sexual
   debut.
   METHODS: Data from a 2005 survey of 4,557 sixth-, seventh- and
   eighth-grade students at 14 urban public schools in Southern California
   were analyzed using chi-square tests and logistic regression, to
   identify correlates of oral sex, intercourse and both.
   RESULTS: Overall, 9\% of youth had ever had sexual intercourse, and 8\%
   had had oral sex. Three percent reported having had oral sex only, 4\%
   intercourse only and 5\% both. Among those who reported intercourse,
   69\% had used a condom at last intercourse, and 43\% had had multiple
   partners. Being male, being black and having at least one friend who had
   ever been involved in a pregnancy were positively associated with having
   had intercourse only and both intercourse and oral sex (odds ratios,
   1.7-4.2). Being in eighth grade, expecting to have intercourse in the
   next six months and currently having a boyfriend or girlfriend were
   positively associated with all three outcomes (2.1-7.2). Intercourse and
   oral sex were highly correlated.
   CONCLUSIONS: Interventions addressing oral sex, intercourse and multiple
   partners should begin before sixth grade and continue throughout the
   middle school years. Health professionals should target adolescent risk
   reduction counseling toward males, blacks, youth with a boyfriend or
   girlfriend, and those with a friend who has been involved in a
   pregnancy. Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, 2010,

Abstract = {{In-silico simulation based on Markov chains is a powerful way to
   describe and predict the activity of many transport proteins including
   ion channels. However, modeling and simulation using realistic models of
   voltage-or ligand-gated ion channels exposed to a wide range of
   experimental conditions require building complex kinetic schemes and
   solving complicated differential equations. To circumvent these
   problems, we developed IonChannelLab a software tool that includes a
   user-friendly Graphical User Interface and a simulation library. This
   program supports channels with Ohmic or Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz behavior
   and can simulate the time-course of ionic and gating currents, single
   channel behavior and steady-state conditions. The program allows the
   simulation of experiments where voltage, ligand and ionic concentration
   are varied independently or simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Objective of the study is to investigate how compliance during the first
   year of methotrexate (MTX) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is
   influenced by the patients' perception of the necessity for and concern
   about MTX, the patients' functional disability, and the dose of MTX. A
   total of 126 RA patients completed a questionnaire at start of MTX
   treatment and after 9 months. The MTX compliance was measured by using
   the Compliance Questionnaire Rheumatology (CQR). The prevalence of
   having a CQR score in the bottom quartile was stratified according to
   age, gender, the duration of RA, MTX dose, years of school education,
   functional disability, use of folic acid, and co-morbidity. Crude and
   adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were
   calculated by using log-binomial regression. The necessity and concern
   scales of the Beliefs about Medication Questionnaire were dichotomised
   into high perception of MTX necessity and low concern about MTX
   treatment, and the crude and adjusted PR of having a CQR score in the
   bottom quartile were estimated. The prevalence of having a CQR in the
   bottom quartile was 23\%, both at baseline and after 9 months, and this
   finding was not associated with the MTX dose level or the patients'
   functional disability. Among patients with a CQR in the bottom quartile,
   the prevalence of having low perceptions of MTX necessity was 37.1
   versus 14.0\% for patients with high perceptions of necessity
   {[}adjusted PR: 0.3 (95\% CI 0.2-0.8)]. The same tendency was seen after
   9 months. The prevalence of having a CQR in the bottom quartile or not
   was almost equally distributed among patients who had high or low
   concerns about treatment at baseline. After 9 months, however, the
   prevalence of having a CQR in the bottom quartile was 18.9\% for
   patients who had low concerns about the MTX treatment, versus 37.7\% for
   patients who had higher concerns about the treatment {[}adjusted PR: 0.5
   (95\% CI 0.2-1.3)]. During the first year of treatment, compliance with
   MTX treatment among RA patients could be explained by strong perceptions
   of a personal need for the treatment. Compliance did not seem to be
   influenced by the patients' functional impairment or the MTX dose level.}},

Abstract = {{Parasites from the Trypanosomatidae family cause different illnesses in
   human and animals. Drugs currently in use against them have limited
   efficacy and high toxicity, therefore is very important that scientists
   continue their efforts to look for new targets for the treatment of
   these diseases. Trypanosome brucei is the causal agent of African
   trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in human and animals, and is one of
   the trypanosome species that are actively investigated.
   Trypanosomes in the blood depend entirely from the glycolisis in order
   to obtain energy, so this is one of the possible points of attack. The
   aldolase fructose biphosphate seems to be until now the regulator of the
   glycolisis so its study is very important. The modeled three-dimensional
   structure of aldolase fructose biphosphate from Trypanosome brucei was
   obtained using the program Modeller based on the sequence previously
   published by Clayton. This modeled structure will help as a stamina
   point for future rational chemotherapy studies, and the methodology
   described could be used for other enzymes of unknown three dimensional
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we focus on two questions: How well do teachers
   understand their current pension plans, and what do they think about
   alternative plan structures? The data come from administrative records
   and a 2006 survey of teachers in Washington State. The results suggest
   that Washington's teachers are fairly knowledgeable about their
   pensions, although new entrants and mid-career teachers appear to be
   less knowledgeable than veterans. As for teachers' preferences for plan
   structure, the survey suggests that when it comes to investing
   additional retirement savings, a plurality of teachers favor defined
   contribution plans that offer more portability and choice but also more
   risk than traditional defined benefit plans. Again, perhaps
   unsurprisingly, the findings suggest that, all else equal, teachers
   newer to the profession are more likely than veterans to favor a defined
   contribution structure.}},

Abstract = {{Two anatomically preserved gymnosperm trunks with clusters of epicormic
   shoots are described from the Late Permian of Antarctica. The
   best-preserved trunk is 14 cm long. It has a small circular
   parenchymatous pith and 9 cm of secondary xylem that contains at least
   50 growth rings. The second specimen is slightly smaller (11 3 8 cm) and
   has 20 growth rings. Both specimens have pycnoxylic wood and produced
   more than 50 small shoots in a delimited zone on the surface of the
   trunk. Shoots have a wide parenchymatous pith that may be solid to
   septate with endarch primary xylem forming 8-10 sympodia and a small
   amount of secondary xylem similar to that of the parent trunk. The
   shoots branch and increase in number toward the outside of the trunk.
   Evidence based on anatomical comparisons and association at the site
   indicates that the specimens probably represent trunks of some
   glossopterid, the dominant group of seed ferns during the Permian in
   Gondwana. This is the first report of clusters of epicormic shoots in a
   Paleozoic gymnosperm. The ability to produce a large number of young
   shoots that were capable of developing into new branches indicates that
   these high-latitude trees possessed an architectural plasticity that
   allowed them to respond quickly to short-or long-term environmental
   stress.}},

Abstract = {{Elucidating the mechanisms by which honey bees process pollen vs.
   protein supplements are important in the generation of artificial diets
   needed to sustain managed honeybees. We measured the effects of diet on
   protein concentration, hypopharyngeal gland development and virus titers
   in worker honey bees fed either pollen, a protein supplement (MegaBee),
   or a protein-free diet of sugar syrup. Workers consumed more pollen than
   protein supplement, but protein amounts and size of hypopharyngeal gland
   acini did not differ between the two feeding treatments. Bees fed sugar
   syrup alone had lower protein concentrations and smaller hypopharyngeal
   glands compared with the other feeding treatments especially as the bees
   aged. Deformed wing virus was detected in workers at the start of a
   trial. The virus concentrations increased as bees aged and were highest
   in those fed sugar syrup and lowest in bees fed pollen. Overall results
   suggest a connection between diet, protein levels and immune response
   and indicate that colony losses might be reduced by alleviating protein
   stress through supplemental feeding. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure of rats to environmental heat enhances the expression of heat
   shock protein-72 (Hsp-72) in most of their organs proportionally to heat
   stress severity. Pre-induction or over-expression of Hsp-72 prevents
   organ damage and lethality, suggesting that heat shock proteins (Hsps)
   may have a pathogenic role in this condition. We investigated the
   expression profile of Hsps in baboons subjected to environmental heat
   stress until the core temperature attained 42.5A degrees C (moderate
   heatstroke) or occurrence of hypotension associated with core
   temperature a parts per thousand yen43.5A degrees C (severe heatstroke).
   Western blot analysis demonstrated a differential induction of Hsp-72
   among organs of heat-stressed animals with the highest induction in the
   liver and the lowest in lung. Hsp-60 and Hsc-70 expression was similar
   between control and heat-stressed animals. ELISA studies indicated a
   marked release of Hsp-72 into the circulation of baboons with severe
   heatstroke with a peak at 24 h post-heatstroke onset and remained
   sustained up to 72 h. Hsp-72 release was not associated with core
   temperature or systolic blood pressure, but correlated with markers of
   liver, myocardium, and skeletal muscle tissue necrosis. Non-survivors
   displayed significantly higher Hsp-72 levels than survivors. No Hsp-60
   was detected in the circulation. These findings add further evidence
   that increased expression of Hsp-72 may be an important component of the
   host response to severe heatstroke. They also suggest that extracellular
   Hsp-72 is a marker of multiple organs tissue damage. Whether
   extracellular Hsp-72 plays a role in the host immune response to heat
   stress merits further studies.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Few studies have investigated current practices in the USA
   relating to warfarin use and monitoring, or the effects of warfarin
   discontinuation on risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding
   complications. This study investigated the effect of warfarin
   discontinuation on rates of VTE recurrence in a real-world setting.
   Methods: Integrated Healthcare Information Services database records
   from January 2003 to September 2007 from patients aged at least 18
   years, hospitalized for VTE, and with at least two prescriptions or 60
   days of warfarin treatment were reviewed, with warfarin discontinuation
   and international normalized ratio (INR) data collated.
   Results: A total of 1027 of 8380 (12.3\%) patients discontinued warfarin
   within 3 months. Overall, 1656 (19.8\%) patients had no INR monitoring,
   with 38.1\% of INR values being inside the therapeutic range ( INR 2-3).
   Recurrent VTE was observed in 915 (10.9\%) patients. Significant
   predictors of recurrent VTE ( at any time) included discontinuation of
   warfarin within 3 months, time from index VTE to warfarin initiation,
   previous VTE-related hospitalization, and duration of index
   hospitalization. Conclusion: This study found that in a real-world
   population, less than 50\% of warfarin patients achieved INR values
   within the therapeutic range. Warfarin discontinuation within 3 months
   was associated with a higher rate of recurrent VTE.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Heart failure (HF) has clinically significant psychological
   and physical consequences for older persons, and hospitalization for HF
   is frequent and costly to the Medicare program. As HF is the most common
   primary Medicare home care diagnosis, there is a critical need to
   develop home care services that improve heath-related outcomes for this
   population. The primary aim of this pilot study was to develop,
   implement, and test the initial feasibility and potential efficacy of
   the Home-Care Education, Assessment, Remote-Monitoring, and Therapeutic
   Activities (HEART) trial, a nurse-directed multicomponent home care
   intervention. Observed outcomes were quality of life (QOL), depressive
   symptoms, and 90-day hospitalization. Methods: Twenty-four patients with
   a primary diagnosis of HF were assigned to the intervention (n = 12) or
   control group (n = 12) according to geographical location in a large
   multibranch Medicare-certified home health agency. Intervention group
   patients received 8 structured nurse education visits using
   evidence-based protocols designed in previous trials to teach HF
   self-management and to prevent/reduce depression, as well as a
   telemonitoring system. Control group patients received usual care and
   telemonitoring. Quality of life was assessed using the Minnesota Living
   With Heart Failure questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assed using
   the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 at baseline and 90-day study end
   point. Results: Study protocols and instrumentation were found to be
   feasible and effective. Examination of enrollment data led to a
   reevaluation of eligibility criteria. Patients participating in the
   HEART intervention demonstrated significantly improved QOL (F = 8.99, P
   = .007) and significantly reduced depressive symptoms (F = 35.10, P =
   .001) in comparison to control group patients at the study end point.
   There was a trend toward lower hospital readmission rates in the
   intervention group (16\% vs 25\%), but this was not statistically
   significant. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that a full-scale
   trial of the HEART intervention is feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aims to demonstrate demographic and clinical
   properties of patients referred to our oncologic rehabilitation unit
   with the diagnosis of breast cancer-related lymphedema.
   Materials and Method: Fifty-seven women were evaluated. Demographics,
   pathological diagnosis, treatments, number of dissected and metastatic
   nodes were recorded. Pain, numbness, heaviness, and functional loss were
   sought. Circumferential limb measurements were used in the assessment of
   lymphedema. The patients were divided into two groups: Group1 - with
   grade 1 lymphedema (reversible lymphedema, n=20) and Group 2 - with
   grade 2-3 lymphedema (irreversible lymphedema, n=37).
   Results: The mean age was 50.92 +/- 10.58 years and the mean
   postoperative period was 25.61 +/- 16.01 (4-72) months. The problems
   associated with lymphedema, such as sense of heaviness in the affected
   limb (n=25), pain (n=47), numbness (n=19), and functional loss (n=25),
   were observed. Circumferential measurements of the limb showed positive
   correlations with the body mass index (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: Lymphedema is one of the major causes of morbidity in breast
   cancer patients. It might result in pain, numbness, sense of heaviness,
   and functional loss. Obesity is an important risk factor for lymphedema.
   Patient lymphedema education as well as defining and controlling the
   risk factors are of importance in the prevention of lymphedema. Turk J

Abstract = {{For potential consideration by the Mind, Brain, and Education community,
   here is a modest but provocative hypothesis regarding the relationships
   between acquisition of languages, awareness of cultures, and development
   of ethics in human beings. Starting from the basic idea according to
   which ``a fish does not know what water is,{''} and using both various
   literature sources and my personal experience of linguistic/cultural
   diversity, I postulate, using the mathematical metaphor of the
   ``tesseract,{''} that mastery of several languages is not only essential
   to developing cultural awareness but also a key to (partial) access to
   global awareness. This might open research avenues for colleagues
   interested in some of these fields, or in all of them; if sound
   neuroscientific work, possibly combined with quantitative studies,
   proves the hypothesis right, then we may hope to take one small step
   toward more tolerance: yet another ``giant leap for mankind{''}? Let us

   Within a typical healthcare institution, one particular facility which

Volume = {{53}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis We examined whether small amounts of low-intensity
   physical activity were associated with reduced risk of developing type 2
   diabetes in a national sample of people aged 50 years and over.
   Methods The sample comprised 7,466 individuals (55.9\% women) free from
   self-reported doctor-diagnosed diabetes and was prospectively followed
   for a mean of 45.3 months. Baseline self-reported physical activity was
   categorised as physical inactivity, low-and vigorous/moderate-intensity
   physical activity at least once a week. Cox proportional hazard
   regression was used to model the association between baseline physical
   activity and incident type 2 diabetes.
   Results Vigorous/moderate-intensity physical activity at least once a
   week was associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (HR 0.64, 95\%
   CI 0.43-0.95, p=0.026) but low-intensity physical activity at least once
   a week was not (HR 0.87, 95\% CI 0.58-1.30, p=0.497) after adjustment
   for all covariates. However, age-stratified analysis showed that
   low-intensity physical activity at least once a week was associated with
   reduced risk of type 2 diabetes for those aged 70 years and over (HR
   0.53, 95\% CI 0.28-1.02, p=0.059), but not for those aged 50 to 59 years
   (HR 1.09, 95\% CI 0.52-2.29, p=0.828) or those aged 60 to 69 years (HR
   1.15, 95\% CI 0.55-2.41, p=0.715) after adjustment for all covariates.
   Conclusions/interpretation Compared with physical inactivity, any type
   of physical activity was associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes
   in adults aged 70 years and over, while in adults aged 50 to 69 years,
   physical activity needed to be vigorous/moderate in intensity to be
   associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the use of stimulated recall interviews as a
   technique for investigating how people approach interactions in a number
   of different situations. In general, the technique I describe involves
   interviewing individuals by playing them audio or audiovisual recordings
   of their own behavior in social situations and discussing different
   aspects of those recorded interactions. Doing so can help us to
   understand what signals interactants understand as important, what
   signals they try to convey to others, and how they choose from various
   options to act upon the information they receive in interactions. Using
   the example of jazz jam sessions, I ask why it is that interactions can
   sometimes go smoothly and uneventfully, or sometimes break down
   completely. The stimulated recall interviews provide a valuable tool in
   helping the ethnographer to answer these kinds of questions.}},

   conditions the widespread disdain toward polygamy, and that renders it
   fundamentally different from familial configurations that are associated
   with national identity. Relating political and philosophical doctrines
   to the archival documentation and insights of contemporary legal and
   cultural historians of anti-polygamy sentiment, it elucidates the racial
   Anglo-Saxonism of Hegel's ruminations on marriage and on the state, and
   highlights its reverberation within the political philosophy that
   justified the criminalization of polygamy and its supporting
   institutions in the nineteenth century and in contemporary immigration

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate for up to 7 years
   the prevalence of autoimmune disorders among naive (untreated) multiple
   sclerosis family members compared with a contemporary general control
   population in Northern Greece, in a prospective case-control study, and
   to examine the possible relationship between immunomodulatory treatment
   and the appearance of additional autoimmune disorders.
   Methods: The patients and controls enrolled comprised 1383 patients with
   definite MS and 4392 relatives in their families and a total of 452
   controls families with 1652 members.
   Results: At baseline, 891 multiple sclerosis families with 3112 members
   (73 multiplex multiple sclerosis families with 292 members and 818
   simplex families with 2820 members) and 355 control families with 1580
   members were examined regarding whether they had any of 12 autoimmune
   diseases. The baseline affected multiplex plus simplex multiple
   sclerosis families, the family members and the coexistent additional
   autoimmune disorders were higher compared with controls. There was an
   increase in longitudinally affected multiple sclerosis families,
   multiple sclerosis family members and coexistent additional autoimmune
   disorders compared with respective findings at the baseline observation.
   Comparison analysis between two time point observations (after a mean
   7.1 +/- 2.2 years) for each autoimmune disorder in overall multiple
   sclerosis family members revealed increased rates for longitudinal
   autoimmune Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, insulin-dependent
   diabetes mellitus, psoriasis and vitiligo (p = 0.02, p = 0.006, p =
   0.0004, p = 0.05, and p = 0.05, respectively). Some 145 newly developed,
   longitudinally definite autoimmune cases were recognized in multiplex
   plus simplex multiple sclerosis families; 116 (80\%) of these disorders
   were observed in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with
   immunomodulatory medications, and 68 of these 116 (58.6\%) cases
   exhibited baseline positive autoreactive antibodies. Binary logistic
   regression analysis revealed that immunotherapy predisposes to
   autoimmunity (odds ratio 2.8, p < 0.001) independently of the presence
   of baseline autoantibodies and patients' gender.
   Conclusions: There is a longitudinally increased frequency of additional
   autoimmune disorders among multiple sclerosis family members, probably
   related to immunomodulatory therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To determine the anaesthetic and systemic effects of dorsolumbar
   epidural anaesthesia using non-stylet multiport catheters via the caudal
   approach to administer hypertonic 5\% lignocaine (HL) or hypertonic
   0.5\% bupivacaine (HB) to the flank in standing cattle.
   Materials and methods
   Six healthy adult cattle weighing 310-455 kg received 0.2 mg/kg HL or
   0.025 mg/kg of HB; control animals received 0.9\% saline solution. All
   drugs were injected into the dorsolumbar epidural space via a caudal
   approach through a non-stylet multiport catheter. Each animal received
   each treatment at random. Evaluations of anaesthesia, ataxia, heart
   rate, arterial pressures, respiratory rate and rectal temperature were
   obtained at 0 (basal), 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 min after
   epidural injection and then at 30-min intervals until loss of
   anaesthesia. All animals received a standard noxious stimulus and a
   4-point scale was used to score the response. A second scale was used to
   score ataxia.
   Results
   The duration of anaesthesia in the upper and lower flanks in cattle was
   68 +/- 12 and 110 +/- 15 min (mean +/- SD) after dorsolumbar epidural HL
   or HB, respectively. Both hypertonic local anaesthetics produced a mild
   ataxia. The systemic changes were within acceptable limits in these
   clinically healthy cattle.
   Conclusion
   In standing cattle the dorsolumbar epidural injection of hypertonic
   lignocaine provided faster onset of anaesthesia and fewer cardiovascular
   effects, but had a shorter duration of anaesthesia than hypertonic
   bupivacaine.}},

Abstract = {{Lymphocele is a well-known complication of renal transplantation.
   Presenting symptoms are nonspecific; most patients are entirely
   asymptomatic. Herein, we have reported a case of lymphocele due to an
   asymptomatic lymphatic Wuchereria bancrofti filariasis with
   deterioration of graft function. A 53-year-old man with end-stage renal
   disease secondary to vascular disease was admitted 40 days after
   transplantation with vague, isolated abdominal pain. An abdomen and
   pelvis ultrasound examination demonstrated a cystic structure in the
   renal hilus. Graft function deteriorated, so the patient underwent
   puncture of the lymphocele followed by povidone iodine sclerotherapy. In
   the percutaneous drainage, we noted a fine whitish strand 4-mm thick
   similar to the shape of the stent, a part of which seemed to go into the
   transplantation fossa. Parasitological examination showed an adult
   female worm of W bancrofti measuring 6 cm. The test for microfilaremia
   was negative. The patient was treated for 10 days with a combination of
   Ivermectin and Albendazole associated with Doxycycline. The collection
   rapidly decreased after worm treatment. This case describes a post-renal
   transplantation lymphocele due to asymptomatic lymphatic filariasis.}},

Abstract = {{We report the first hollow core photonic crystal fibers (HC PCF) in

   index glass, we use both band diagram analysis to define the required
   photonic bandgap and numerical simulations of finite size HC PCFs to
   compute the guiding losses. The material losses have also been taken
   into account to compute the overall losses of the HC PCF profiles. These
   fibers were fabricated by the stack and draw technique from Te20As30Se50
   (TAS) glass. The fibers we drew in this work are composed of six rings
   of holes and regular microstructures. Two profiles are presented, one is
   known as a kagome lattice and the other one corresponds to a triangular
   lattice. Geometrical parameters are compared to the expected parameters
   obtained by computation. Applications of such fibers include power
   delivery or fiber sensors among others. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{RESEARCH IN SOCIAL \& ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{232-245}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Migraine is a common, disabling, and underdiagnosed
   condition. Pharmacists are in an excellent position to help improve
   migraineur outcomes. The Pharmacists Care of Migraineurs Scale (PCMS)
   may be useful for documenting migraineur care and in the design and
   targeting of interventions aimed at improving care.
   Objectives: (1) To identify personal and situational work variables
   associated with pharmacists' provision of care to migraineurs that is
   measured using the PCMS; and (2) to determine which of these same
   variables are associated with each domain of care composing the PCMS.
   Methods: The PCMS is a 41-item measure eliciting pharmacists'
   frequencies of engagement in certain care behaviors comprising 7 unique
   domains. A survey questionnaire was mailed to a nationwide random sample
   of 6000 community pharmacists containing the PCMS and other items
   measuring personal and situational work variables. Factor scores of
   responses from a principal axis factoring procedure composing the PCMS
   were saved as dependent variables. Respondents' composite PCMS scores
   and each of the 7 factor scores were regressed over the personal and
   situational work variables in 8 unique stepwise regression procedures to
   identify those variables significant in explaining pharmacists' care of
   migraineurs.
   Results: The 3 independent study variables most closely related to
   provision of care to migraineurs were self-assessed knowledge of
   migraine, perceived difficulty (lack of), and caring ability. Models for
   individual PCMS domains were similar; however, some models included
   extroversion and pharmacy organizational culture variables, such as
   patient orientation and quality focus.
   Conclusions: Self-assessed knowledge of migraine, perceived lack of
   difficulty, and caring ability are important determinants in the level
   of care provided to migraineurs by pharmacists. Future study should
   further delineate the role of the pharmacy's work environment and
   pharmacists' training needs in elevating levels of care. Comprehensive
   continuing education programs on migraine management would appear
   advisable. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and most
   aggressive types of primary brain tumors in humans. Even with aggressive
   surgical resections using state of the art preoperative and
   intraoperative neuroimaging, along with the most recent techniques in
   radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis for GBM patients remains
   dismal. Survival after diagnosis is about 12-14 months. The tumor cells
   which already have migrated into normal brain tissue beyond the surgical
   resection margin account for the inability to effectively treat this
   tumor. Understanding how to control the migration of GBM cells is
   paramount to future therapies. In this review, we will focus on the
   emerging targets and agents which are being exploited to inhibit the
   migration of glioma cells in GBM.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the generalization to a three-dimensional (3D) case
   of a mechanically-based approach to non-local elasticity theory,
   recently proposed by the authors in a one-dimensional (1D) case. The
   proposed model assumes that the equilibrium of a volume element is
   attained by contact forces between adjacent elements and by long-range
   forces exerted by non-adjacent elements. Specifically, the long-range
   forces are modelled as central body forces depending on the relative
   displacement between the centroids of the volume elements, measured
   along the line connecting the centroids. Further, the long-range forces
   are assumed to be proportional to a proper, material-dependent,
   distance-decaying function and to the products of the interacting
   volumes. Consistently with the modelling of the long-range forces as
   central body forces, the static boundary conditions enforced on the free
   surface of the solid involve only local stress due to contact forces.
   The proposed 3D formulation is developed both in a mechanical and in a
   variational context. For this the elastic energy functionals of the
   solid with long-range interactions are introduced, based on the
   principle of virtual work to set the proper correspondence between the
   mechanical and the kinematic variables of the model. Numerical
   applications are reported for 2D solids under plane stress conditions.

Abstract = {{Before the Revolution, colonial American consumers reconstituted the
   English apple orchard. Unremarkable random seedling apples and
   ``high{''} flavored English cider fruits were devalued. Late colonial
   consumers selected a range of sweeter; more versatile apples for fresh
   use and culinary preparations, others for drying, and many ``winter
   keepers{''} for long-term storage. These trees were supplied by
   distinctive, horticulturally trained farmers who produced grafted trees
   as part of their mixed crop output. Demand for this first catalog of
   American apple trees exploded in the Ohio Valley, where surging farm
   establishment fueled commercial agricultural enterprises. By 1800
   pioneer artisan horticulturists were selling America's favorite
   cultivated apple tree varieties to frontier farmers while mythologized
   peddlers of unimproved, random seedlings contributed only marginally. By
   1820 craft nurserymen marketed tens of thousands of grafted apple trees
   annually and were among the most commercially oriented farmers in the
   Old Northwest.}},

Volume = {{45}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Shal K+ (K(v)A) channels in mammalian neurons have been shown to be
   localized exclusively to somato-dendritic regions of neurons, where they
   function as key determinants of dendritic excitability. To gain insight
   into the mechanisms underlying dendritic localization of K(v)4 channels,
   we use Drosophila melanogaster as our model system. We show that Shal K+
   channels display a conserved somato-dendritic localization in vivo in
   Drosophila. From a yeast-2-hybrid screen, we identify the novel
   interactor, SIDL (for Shal Interactor of Di-Leucine Motif), as the first
   target protein reported to bind the highly conserved dileucine motif
   (LL-motif) implicated in dendritic targeting. We show that SIDL is
   expressed primarily in the nervous system, co-localizes with GFP-Shal
   channels in neurons, and interacts specifically with the LL-motif of
   Drosophila and mouse Shal channels. We disrupt the Shal-SIDL interaction
   by mutating the LL-motif on Shal channels, and show that Shal K+
   channels are then mislocalized to some, but not all, axons in vivo.
   These results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms underlying Shal
   K+ channel targeting, one of which depends on the LL-motif. The
   identification of SIDL may provide the first step for future
   investigation into the molecular machinery regulating the
   LL-motif-dependent targeting of K+ channels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A recent contribution published in this journal (Dias-da-Silva and Ilha
   2009) reported a dermal skull fragment indicating the presence of a
   putative plagiosauroid temnospondyl in the Lower Triassic Sanga do
   Cabral Formation of the Parana Basin, Southern Brazil. The taxonomic
   assignation of this specimen was necessarily tentative as it was based
   on circumstantial evidence, specifically the presence of a dense
   pustular ornamentation over four partial dermal skull bones,
   consideration of the described taxa known to bear such ornamentation,
   and the stratigraphic and paleobiogeographic range of such taxa.
   Therefore, Diasda-Silva and Ilha (2009) could not be totally certain
   about the plagiosauroid affinities of the new specimen and ascribed it
   to ?Plagiosauridae. It was particularly difficult to make a precise
   osteological identification of the specimen and six alternative
   osteological interpretations were made in comparison to both Gerrothorax
   and Peltobatrachus (see Dias-da-Silva and Ilha 2009: fig. 2). In spite
   of the poor taxonomic resolution, the new specimen raised interesting
   questions regarding the presence of plagiosauroid stereospondyls in
   western Gondwana, as well as their evolutionary patterns,
   biostratigraphic and paleobiogeographic implications. After
   Dias-da-Silva and Ilha's (2009) contribution was published, new data
   from Damiani et al. (2009) raised the possibility of narrowing down the
   taxonomic identity of the plagiosauroid from Brazil. Accordingly, this
   brief report provides a more precise taxonomic assignation for this
   material.}},

Abstract = {{Focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) is a completely noninvasive method of
   thermally destroying a target tissue while sparing adjacent tissues and
   organs. Treatment is relatively painless and can be carried out under

   monitor treatments in near real-time, further increasing the safety
   profile of MRgFUS. This technology provides a very personalized
   treatment, adjusted to the individual patient anatomy, pathology and
   treatment response, hence it meets the needs of patients, as well as of
   physicians. MRgFUS has been used extensively in the successful treatment
   of uterine fibroids, and has been shown to be an effective treatment in
   the breast and in bone metastases in smaller scale studies. It shows
   great potential in the treatment of prostate and liver tumors, as well

Abstract = {{Aim Automatic CT dataset classification is important to efficiently
   create reliable database annotations, especially when large collections
   of scans must be analyzed.
   Method An automated segmentation and labeling algorithm was developed
   based on a fast patient segmentation and extraction of statistical
   density class features from the CT data. The method also delivers
   classifications of image noise level and patient size. The approach is
   based on image information only and uses an approximate patient contour
   detection and statistical features of the density distribution. These
   are obtained from a slice-wise analysis of the areas filled by various
   materials related to certain density classes and the spatial spread of
   each class. The resulting families of curves are subsequently classified
   using rules derived from knowledge about features of the human anatomy.
   Results The method was successfully applied to more than 5,000 CT
   datasets. Evaluation was performed via expert visual inspection of
   screenshots showing classification results and detected characteristic
   positions along the main body axis. Accuracy per body region was very
   satisfactory in the trunk (lung/liver > 99.5\% detection rate, presence
   of abdomen > 97\% or pelvis > 95.8\%) improvements are required for
   zoomed scans.
   Conclusion The method performed very reliably. A test on 1,860 CT
   datasets collected from an oncological trial showed that the method is
   feasible, efficient, and is promising as an automated tool for image
   post-processing.}},

Abstract = {{The vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for the structural
   integrity of the vessel wall and also serves as a substrate for the
   binding and retention of secreted products of vascular cells as well as
   molecules coming from the circulation. Although proteomics has been
   previously applied to vascular tissues, few studies have specifically
   targeted the vascular ECM and its associated proteins. Thus, its
   detailed composition remains to be characterized. In this study, we
   describe a methodology for the extraction of extracellular proteins from
   human aortas and their identification by proteomics. The approach is
   based on (a) effective decellularization to enrich for scarce
   extracellular proteins, (b) successful solubilization and
   deglycosylation of ECM proteins, and (c) relative estimation of protein
   abundance using spectral counting. Our three-step extraction approach
   resulted in the identification of 103 extracellular proteins of which
   one-third have never been reported in the proteomics literature of
   vascular tissues. In particular, three glycoproteins (podocan,
   sclerostin, and agrin) were identified for the first time in human
   aortas at the protein level. We also identified extracellular adipocyte
   enhancer-binding protein 1, the cartilage glycoprotein asporin, and a
   previously hypothetical protein, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
   spondin. Moreover, our methodology allowed us to screen for proteolysis
   in the aortic samples based on the identification of proteolytic enzymes
   and their corresponding degradation products. For instance, we were able
   to detect matrix metalloproteinase-9 by mass spectrometry and relate its
   presence to degradation of fibronectin in a clinical specimen. We expect
   this proteomics methodology to further our understanding of the
   composition of the vascular extracellular environment, shed light on ECM
   remodeling and degradation, and provide insights into important
   pathological processes, such as plaque rupture, aneurysm formation, and
   restenosis. Molecular \& Cellular Proteomics 9:2048-2062, 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This article presents an improved pencil-beam dose calculation
   formalism based on an experimental kernel obtained by deconvolution. The
   new algorithm makes it possible to calculate the absorbed dose for all
   field sizes.
   Methods: The authors have enhanced their previous work {[}J. D. Azcona
   and J. Burguete, Med. Phys. 35, 248-259 (2008)] by correcting the kernel
   tail representing the contribution to the absorbed dose far from the
   photon interaction point. The correction was performed by comparing the
   calculated and measured output factors. Dose distributions and absolute
   dose values calculated using the new formalism have been compared to
   measurements. The agreement between calculated and measured dose
   distributions was evaluated according to the gamma-index criteria. In
   addition, 35 individual intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
   fields were calculated and measured in polystyrene using an ionization
   chamber. Furthermore, a series of 541 IMRT fields was calculated using
   the algorithm proposed here and using a commercial IMRT optimization and
   calculation software package. Comparisons were made between the
   calculations at single points located at the isocenter for all the
   beams, as well as between beams grouped by anatomic location.
   Results: The percentage of points passing the gamma-index criteria (3\%,
   3 mm) when comparing calculated and measured dose distributions is
   generally greater than 99\% for the cases studied. The agreement between
   the calculations and the experimental measurements generally lies in the
   +/- 2\% interval for single points, with a mean value of 0.2\%. The
   agreement between calculations using the proposed algorithm and using a
   commercial treatment planning system is also between +/- 5\%.
   Conclusions: An improved algorithm based on an experimental pencil-beam
   kernel obtained by deconvolution has been developed. It has been
   validated clinically and promises to be a valuable tool for IMRT quality
   assurance as an independent calculation system for monitor units and
   dose distributions. An important point is that the algorithm presented
   here uses an experimental kernel, which is therefore independent of
   Monte-Carlo-calculated kernels. (c) 2010 American Association of

Abstract = {{This study observed young, middle-aged, and older adults (N = 239; M-age
   = 49.6 years; range = 18-89 years) for 30 consecutive days to examine
   the association between daily stress and negative affect, taking into
   account potential risk (i.e., self-concept incoherence) and resilience
   (i.e., age, perceived personal control) factors. Results indicated that
   younger individuals and individuals with a more incoherent self-concept
   showed higher average negative affect across the study. As well,
   individuals reported higher negative affect on days that they
   experienced more stress than usual and on days that they reported less
   control than usual. These main effects were qualified by significant
   interactions. In particular, the association between daily stress and
   negative affect was stronger on days on which adults reported low
   control compared with days on which they reported high control (i.e.,
   perceptions of control buffered stress). Reactivity to daily stress did
   not differ for individuals of different ages or for individuals with
   different levels of self-concept incoherence. Although all individuals
   reported higher negative affect on days on which they reported less
   control than usual, this association was more pronounced among younger
   adults. The current study helps to elucidate the role of risk and
   resilience factors when adults are faced with daily stress.}},

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies provide seasonally and spatially resolved information on
   the isotopic characteristics of nitrate supply and N cycling in Southern
   Ocean surface waters. The new data improve our understanding of the
   nitrate supply to the Antarctic surface and its isotopic
   characteristics, especially with regard to the summertime subsurface
   minimum temperature (T(min)) layer in the Antarctic. We use these
   findings to update and compile estimates of the N isotope effect of
   nitrate assimilation, epsilon, in the Southern Ocean near Australia. A
   poleward decrease in epsilon emerges, from 8-9\% in the Subantarctic
   Zone (SAZ, 40-52 degrees S) to similar to 5\% in the Polar Antarctic
   Zone (PAZ, similar to 66 degrees S). epsilon is strongly correlated with
   mixed layer depth at the time of sampling. We hypothesize that the
   correlation is driven by the physiological response of diatoms to light
   availability, with light limitation leading to higher cellular efflux of
   nitrate and thus higher epsilon. Citation: DiFiore, P. J., D. M. Sigman,

Abstract = {{Up to two layers of epitaxial graphene have been grown on the Si-face of

   step of the SiC in a Si-containing gas, followed by an annealing step in
   argon for epitaxial graphene formation. The structure and morphology of
   this graphene has been characterized using atomic force microscopy, high
   resolution transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.
   Furthermore, top-gated radio frequency field-effect transistors

Abstract = {{Consumption of grape seed extract (GSE) is widely marketed as a dietary
   supplement and is considered safe for human health. Nevertheless, the
   analytical composition of GSE from different grape cultivars, growing in
   special agronomic constraints, differs greatly in flavan-3-ols content.
   The major concern with GSE studies is a lack of availability of
   uniformly standardised preparations, which raises an important question
   whether different GSE samples have comparable activity and trigger the
   same mechanisms of action on a given biological system. Therefore, it is
   tempting to speculate that GSE, obtained from different cultivars, could
   exert differentiated anticancer effects. The focus of the present study
   is to determine the selective biological efficacy of GSE obtained from
   three different sources on the human colon cancer cell line Caco-2.
   Irrespective of its source, high doses of GSE induced a significant
   inhibition on Caco-2 cell growth. Moreover, apoptosis was enhanced
   through both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms,
   leading to an early apoptosis-inducing factor release and, further, to a
   dramatic increase in caspase 7 and 3 activity. However, a significant
   difference in apoptotic rates induced by the three grape sources clearly
   emerged when treating cancer cells with low and intermediate GSE
   concentrations (25 and 50 mu g/ml).}},

Title = {{The comparability of mother-report structured interviews and checklists
   for the quantification of youth externalizing symptoms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Although structured interviews are assumed to be scientifically superior
   to checklists for measuring youth psychopathology, few studies have
   tested this hypothesis. Interviews place a much greater burden on
   respondents, making it critical to determine their added value when
   quantifying psychiatric symptoms.
   Methods:
   Confirmatory factor analysis was used to compare interviews and
   checklists in community (N = 251) and clinically referred (N = 406)
   samples of youth aged 5 to 17 years. We examined the associations
   between mother-reported externalizing symptoms assessed by interview
   versus checklist against (a) teacher-reported externalizing symptoms,
   and (b) child's gender, academic performance, single- versus two-parent
   family, and family income. Models in which associations were estimated
   freely were contrasted to models in which the interview and the
   checklist were constrained to have equal associations with the
   variables. Finding these models fit comparably would suggest no
   difference between interviews and checklists.
   Results:
   In the community sample, both the constrained and unconstrained models
   provided comparable fit to the data, suggesting no marked differences
   between interviews and checklists. In the clinical sample, associations
   with the interview were generally stronger. Reducing the number of items
   on the interview to match those on the 6-item checklist eliminated these
   differences, suggesting that the increased reliability of the interview
   scales, afforded by additional items, enhanced their quantification of
   psychopathology.
   Conclusions:
   Consistent with previous studies, interviews were not notably superior
   to checklists for the measurement of externalizing symptoms. When only a
   few items are used, small performance differences between checklists and
   interviews may be due to scale length.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleotides are a class of molecules that play an essential role in
   biological systems. A new method has been developed in the detection of
   nucleotides. These molecules can exist as monomers or constituents of
   oligomers and polymers. As such, they carry from one to several negative
   charges. In this study, different cationic ion-pairing reagents were
   used to complex with each of the 28 nucleotide monomers and nucleotide
   containing compounds. By using this method, this discrete set of anions
   was able to be detected in the positive-mode electrospray ionization
   mass spectrometry, as positively charged complexes. Tandem mass
   spectrometry experiments were also completed on the ion-pairing reagents
   that performed the best in the single ion monitoring (SIM) ion mode, and
   the sensitivity was lowered even further for most of the anions. Limits
   of detection for compounds such as thymidine diphosphate were improved
   as much as 100 times compared to the positive SIM mode, and 750 times
   when compared to the negative mode. A few nucleotides did not show a
   significant increase in sensitivity when analyzed in the positive ion
   mode, but in general the new method developed herein resulted in a much
   greater sensitivity than traditional detection in the negative mode.}},

   thiophene), or an alcohol (ethanol, or 1-butanol, or 1-hexanol, or
   1-octanol, or 1-dodecanol)) have been determined at ambient pressure. A
   dynamic method was used over a broad range of mole fractions and
   temperatures from (260 to 330) K. For the binary systems, the simple
   eutectic diagrams were observed with immiscibility in the liquid phase
   with an upper critical solution temperature (UCST). For mixtures with
   alcohols, it was observed that with increasing chain length of an
   alcohol the solubility decreases and the UCST increases. In the case of
   mixture (IL + benzene, or alkylbenzene, or thiophene) the eutectic
   systems with mutual immiscibility in the liquid phase with very high
   UCSTs were observed. These points were not detectable with our method
   and they were observed at low ionic liquid mole fraction. Densities at
   high temperatures were determined and extrapolated to T = 298.15 K.
   Well-known UNIQUAC, and NRTL equations have been used to correlate
   experimental SLE data sets. For the systems containing immiscibility
   gaps \{IL + an alcohol\} parameters of the LLE correlation equation have
   been derived using only the NRTL equation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We establish an hitherto hidden connection between zero modes and
   instantons in the context of the Kraichnan model for passive scalar
   turbulent advection, that relies on the hypothesis that the production
   of strong gradients of the scalar is associated with Bose-like
   condensation of Lagrangian particles. It opens the way to the
   computation of scaling exponents of the N-th-order structure functions
   of the scalar by techniques borrowed from many-body theory. To lowest
   order of approximation, scaling exponents are found to increase
   asymptotically as logN in two dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric barrier discharge plasma was used to generate a stable strain
   of Klebsiella pneumoniae (designated to as Kp-M2) with improved
   1,3-propanediol production. The specific activities of glycerol
   dehydrogenase, glycerol dehydatase and 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase in
   the crude cell extract increased from 0.11, 9.2 and 0.15 U mg(-1),
   respectively, for wild type to 0.67, 14.4 and 1.6 U mg(-1) for Kp-M2.
   The glycerol flux of Kp-M2 was redistributed with the flux to the
   reductive pathway being increased by 20\% in batch fermentation. The
   final 1,3-propanediol concentrations achieved by Kp-M2 in batch and
   fed-batch fermentations were 19.9 and 76.7 g l(-1), respectively, which
   were higher than those of wild type (16.2 and 49.2 g l(-1)). The results
   suggested that dielectric barrier discharge plasma could be used as an
   effective approach to improve 1,3-propanediol production in K.

Title = {{Assessment of the Neuropeptide S System in Anxiety Disorders}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Background: The G protein-coupled receptor neuropeptide S receptor 1
   (NPSR1) and its ligand neuropeptide S (NPS) form a signaling system
   mainly implicated in susceptibility to asthma and inflammatory disorders
   in humans and regulation of anxiety and arousal in rodents. We addressed
   here the role of NPS and NPSR1 as susceptibility genes for human anxiety
   disorders.
   Methods: We performed comprehensive association analysis of genetic
   variants in NPS and NPSR1 in three independent study samples. We first
   studied a population-based sample (Health 2000, Finland) of 321 anxiety
   disorder patients and 1317 control subjects and subsequently a Spanish
   clinical panic disorder sample consisting of 188 cases and 315 control
   subjects. In addition, we examined a birth cohort of 2020 children (Barn
   Allergi Miljo Stockholm Epidemiologi {[}BAMSE], Sweden). We then tested
   whether alleles of the most significantly associated single nucleotide
   polymorphisms alter DNA-protein complex formation in electrophoretic
   mobility shift assays. Finally, we compared acute stress responses on
   the gene expression level in wild-type and Npsr1(-/-) mice.
   Results: We confirmed previously observed epidemiological association
   between anxiety and asthma in two population-based cohorts. Single
   nucleotide polymorphisms within NPS and NPSR1 associated with panic
   disorder diagnosis in the Finnish and Spanish samples and with
   parent-reported anxiety/depression in the BAMSE sample. Moreover, some
   of the implicated single nucleotide polymorphisms potentially affect
   transcription factor binding. Expression of neurotrophin-3, a
   neurotrophic factor connected to stress and panic reaction, was
   significantly downregulated in brain regions of stressed Npsr1(-/-)
   mice, whereas interleukin-1 beta, an active stress-related
   immuno-transmitter, was upregulated.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that NPS-NPSR1 signaling is likely
   involved in anxiety.}},

   diaminomaleodinitrile with the substituted cinnamils (StCO)(2) obtained
   from biacetyl and arylaldehydes ArCHO. The new porphyrazine macrocycles
   were characterized by electronic absorption and emission spectra, which
   provide evidence of efficient pi-interaction of the peripheral styryl
   moieties with the central pyrazinoporphyrazine framework. The electronic
   excitation of the stylbenoid chromophore in the near UV-region (400 nm)
   leads to strong emission of the porphyrazine chromophore near 700 nm,
   allowing to consider the styryl-substituted porphyrazines as efficient
   light-harvesting species. Their spectral properties and electrochemical
   behavior are compared with those of stylbenoid phthalocyanines and
   peripherally substituted tetrapyrazinoporphyrazines.}},

Abstract = {{The slug flow is a common occurrence in gas-liquid piping flows. Usually
   it is an undesirable flow regime since the existence of long lumps of
   liquid slug moving at high speed is unfavorable to gas-liquid
   transportation, so that considerable effort has been devoted to study
   its hydrodynamic characteristics. In this work, a capacitive probe was
   used for dynamic measurements in the horizontal air-water slug flows,
   for several flow rates. The acquired signals were representative of the
   effective liquid layer thickness near every cross sectional area of the
   flow, instead of merely the holdup or void fraction in a finite volume
   of the flow. This was possible because probe had a thin sensing
   electrode that minimizes the axial length effect on the measurements.
   Tests were performed in a 34 mm i.d. acrylic pipe, 5 m long; in which
   slug flows as well as stratified-smooth and stratified-wavy flows were
   generated. Signal analysis techniques were applied for flow regime
   identification and toward characterization of these two-phase flows:
   Power Spectrum Density (PSD) from Fourier Transform and Probability
   Density Function (PDF) from Statistical Analysis. Therefore, PSD and PDF
   graphs were taken as signatures of each flow under test and a
   correlation was calculated for each PSD and PDF set of data, which
   showed to be a robust parameter for correct flow regime identification.

Abstract = {{ITAQUAQUECETUBA FORMATION PALYNOSTRATIGRAPHY, SAO PAULO BASIN, BRAZIL.
   In order to identify the palynofloristic associations and their
   respective guide-species from the Mine Itaquareia 1 outcropping beds, in
   Itaquaquecetuba Formation (Sao Paulo sedimentary basin), 44 samples were
   analyzed, of which, 42 were collected along 10 columnar section and 2 of
   them immediately on the crystalline basement. The identification of the
   palynological associations endorsed the establishment of paleoclimate
   prevailing at the time of sedimentation, while the determination of the
   guide species aimed at defining the age. of this lithostratigraphical
   unit. This age is very controversial in the literature, where is
   referred from the Eocene to the Pleistocene. This study has identified
   two palynofloristic associations: one Late Eocene and the other Early
   Oligocene. The first one is characterized by great diversity in
   palynoflora, especially, angiosperms, while the second, on the last
   three samples from the top of the section showed a reduction in
   biodiversity of flowering plants and increased amount of gymnosperms,
   especially, Dacrydiumites florinii. The Late Eocene palynofloristic
   associations suggested a subtropical to tropical moist paleoclimatic
   conditions, while the reduction of biodiversity and the expansion of
   gymnosperms, which occurs in the samples of the upper portion of the
   section, Early Oligocene in age, are evidence of colder weather in this
   period.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of the present study was to verify the
   hypothesis that no difference in biocompatibility exists between
   different orthodontic adhesives. Material and Methods: Thirty male
   Wistar rats were used in this study and divided into five groups (n=6):
   Group 1 (control, distilled water), Group 2 (Concise), Group 3 (Xeno
   III), Group 4 (Transbond XT), and Group 5 (Transbond plus Self-Etching
   Primer). Two cavities were performed in the subcutaneous dorsum of each
   animal to place a polyvinyl sponge soaked with 2 drops of the respective
   adhesive in each surgical loci. Two animals of each group were
   sacrificed after 7, 15, and 30 days, and their tissues were analyzed by
   using an optical microscope. Results: At day 7, Groups 3 (Transbond XT)
   and 4 (Xeno III) showed intense mono- and polymorphonuclear inflammatory
   infiltrate with no differences between them, whereas Groups 1 (control)
   and 2 (Concise) showed moderate mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. At
   day 15, severe inflammation was observed in Group 3 (Transbond XT)
   compared to other groups. At day 30, the same group showed a more
   expressive mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate compared to other groups.
   Conclusion: Among the orthodontic adhesive analyzed, it may be concluded
   that Transbond XT exhibited the worst biocompatibility. However, one
   cannot intrepret the specificity of the data generated in vivo animal
   models as a human response.}},

Abstract = {{Among Americans, the risk for kidney disease is higher in individuals of
   African descent (AA) when compared with Caucasians. We considered
   whether there are similar racial differences in kidney function soon
   after donor nephrectomy. Of the 31 928 live kidney donors that donated
   between the years 2000 and 2005, 16 996 (53\%) had post-donation serum
   creatinine recorded at a mean follow-up of 156 d (range 1-1410 d). A
   total of 14 525 (85\%) were Caucasians and 2471 (15\%) were AA. When
   compared with Caucasians, AA donors were more likely to be younger,
   heavier, and male, had a higher baseline serum creatinine and a shorter
   duration of follow-up. After accounting for these differences, the serum
   creatinine after donation and fractional rise in serum creatinine after
   donation were similar between the two groups (AA vs. Caucasian donors,
   1.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.3 mg/dL; 53\% vs. 45\%) and the post-donation
   estimated glomerular filtration rate was also similar (57.2 +/- 0.6 vs.
   56.0 +/- 0.2 mL/min per 1.73 m2). We observed no major clinical
   difference in glomerular filtration rate and ability to compensate for
   loss of renal mass soon after live kidney donation between Caucasian and
   AA donors.}},

   this field and, finally, the sources of financing are isufficient.
   Despite the good news that much has been improved after establishment of
   the Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund, the smallest
   progress has been made in the sphere of defining the waste management
   centres, one of which is planned in every county instead of up to four,
   which is considered cost effective from the economic standpoint. In
   addition, appropriate design documents are still lacking, and many waste
   disposal sites have not been improved and closed as planned, which has
   bad a negative effect on water protection. Some problems have also been
   encountered in the selection of technology. Two technologies, advocated
   by powerful monopolices, are currently dominant on the international
   plan. One is the mechanical-biological treatment, which has been
   accepted (with modifications) by the Croatian Governament, and the other
   implies construction of waste-powered plants. However, both of these

   genotypes. Although the differences of SOD activities between two
   genotypes in response to Al toxicity depended on Al concentration and
   durations of treatment, SOD activities in the roots of PI were higher
   than those in the roots of corresponding Young in the presence of Al for
   36 or 48 h. Meanwhile, the POD activities in PI roots increased as the
   Al levels and durations of treatment increased, significantly higher
   than those in the corresponding Young roots. Moreover, Al-treated PI had
   significantly lower lipid peroxidation than Young at both root and
   callus levels. These results suggest that the enhanced
   antioxidant-related enzyme activities and reduced lipid peroxidation in
   PI might be one of Al-tolerant mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Testate amoebae are increasingly used for environmental monitoring as
   well as paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Paleoecological
   interpretations of testate amoebae assemblages depend on the
   understanding of the ecological processes operating today. We then ask
   the question of the link between testate structure and its environment.
   This study analyses both the grain size and mineralogical assemblage of
   tests of common species belonging to the genus Centropyxis and
   Difflugia. It is concluded that grain size is a limiting factor for test
   construction, whereas mineral composition is not. Hence, when analyzing
   agglutinated testate amoebae for paleoenvironmental reconstructions, it
   should be taken into account the mean grain size of the sediment. A
   non-appropriate grain-size probably inhibits the development of a
   testate amoebae specific assemblage. (C) 2010 Academic des sciences.

Abstract = {{Wave overtopping nearshore coastal structures, such as shore-parallel
   breakwaters, can significantly alter the current circulation and
   sediment transport patterns around the structures, which in turn affects
   the formation of tombolos and salients in the nearshore area. This paper
   describes the implementation of a wave overtopping module into an
   existing depth-averaged coastal morphological mode: COAST2D and model
   applications to investigate the effect of wave overtopping on the
   hydrodynamics and morphodynamics around a group of shore-parallel
   breakwaters. The hydrodynamic aspects of the model were validated
   against a series of laboratory conditions. The model was then applied to
   a study site at Sea Palling, Norfolk, UK, where 9 shore-parallel
   segmented breakwaters including 4 surface-piercing and 5 low-crested
   breakwaters are present, for the storm conditions in Nov 2006. The model
   results were compared with laboratory data and field measurements,
   showing a good agreement on both hydrodynamics and morphological
   changes. Further analysis of wave overtopping effect on the nearshore
   hydrodynamics and morphodynamics reveals that wave overtopping has
   significant impacts on the nearshore circulation, sediment transport and
   the resulting morphological changes within such a complex breakwater
   scheme under the storm and macro-tide conditions. The results indicate
   the importance of including the wave overtopping in modelling nearshore
   morphodynamics with the presence of coastal structures. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Ciliate Euplotes octocarinatus centrin (EoCen) is a member of the
   EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins. It has been proven,
   using Tb3+ as a fluorescence probe, that EoCen has four calcium-binding
   sites. The sensitized emission arises from nonradiative energy transfer
   between the three tyrosine residues (Tyr46, Tyr72, and Tyr79) of the
   N-terminal half and the bound Tb3+ ions. To determine the most critical
   of the three tyrosine residues for the process of fluorescence resonance
   energy transfer, six mutants of the N-terminal domain of EoCen, which
   contain one (N-Tyr46/N-Tyr72/N-Tyr79) or two (N-Y46F/N-Y72F/N-Y79F)
   tyrosine residues, were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. The
   aromatic residue-sensitized Tb3+ fluorescence of N-Y79F was most
   affected, displaying a 50\% reduction compared with wild-type N-EoCen.
   Among the tyrosines, Tyr79 is the shortest mean distance from the
   protein-bound Tb3+ (at sites I/II), as calculated via the Forster
   mechanism. The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence parameters of
   the wild-type N-EoCen and the three double mutants suggest that Tyr79,
   which exists in a hydrophobic environment, has the highest quantum yield
   and a relatively long average lifetime. The decay of Tyr79 is the least
   heterogeneous among the three tyrosine residues. In addition, molecular
   modeling shows that a critical hydrogen bond is formed between the
   4-hydroxyl group of Tyr79 and the oxygen from the side chains of the
   residue Asn39. Kinetic experiments on tyrosine and Tb3+ fluorescence
   demonstrate that tyrosine fluorescence quenching is largely due to the
   self-assembly of EoCen, and that the quenching degrees of the mutants
   differ. Resonance light scattering and crosslinking analysis carried out
   on the full-length single mutants (Y46F, Y72F, and Y79F) showed that
   Tyr79 also plays the most important role in the Tb3+-dependent
   self-assembly of EoCen among the three tyrosines.}},

Abstract = {{Significant growth inhibition effects of procyanidins from lotus

   found both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo treatment with LSPCs inhibited
   tumour growth in C57BL/6 J mice by 55.3\% in terms of average tumour

   catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in liver tissue. In
   vitro assay of anti-cancer activities suggested that LSPCs (25-100 mu

   dose-dependent mode. Furthermore, LSPCs had significant (P<0.05)
   stimulatory effects on mouse splenocyte proliferation. The prevention of

Title = {{Feeding preferences of the sandhopper Orchestoidea tuberculata: the

Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{651}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Factors such as nutritional quality and the secondary metabolite content
   of food resources have been shown to influence the feeding behavior of
   herbivores in many marine habitats. For intertidal macroalgae consumers
   on sandy beaches, the influence of these factors on feeding behavior and
   the consequences on their performance is poorly understood. In this
   study, we evaluated the relationships of nutritional quality, chemical
   defenses (phlorotannins), and the structure of three macroalgal species
   that form the bulk of imported wrack subsidies to beaches in southern
   Chile, with the feeding behavior, absorption efficiency, and growth rate
   of the talitrid amphipod Orchestoidea tuberculata, one of the most
   abundant organisms in this environment. The amphipods preferred
   Durvillaea antarctica over Lessonia nigrescens and Macrocystis pyrifera
   when simultaneously offered fresh pieces of each alga. Similar results
   were observed when artificial food made of dry powdered algae of each
   species was provided, suggesting that the structure of these three algae
   did not influence preference. The performance of amphipods when reared
   on a diet of a single algal species matched feeding preferences; higher
   growth rates were observed in treatments with the preferred alga, D.
   antarctica. These results imply that D. antarctica is a superior food
   item for O. tuberculata when compared to L. nigrescens or M. pyrifera,
   and also that the alga's intrinsic quality (i.e., not structure) may
   influence dietary preference in these consumers. The higher content of
   proteins and carbohydrates found in D. antarctica may explain why this
   macroalga represents better quality food for O. tuberculata.
   Phlorotannin content did not have obvious negative effects on diet
   choice or growth, as D. antarctica, the alga with greater content of
   these secondary metabolites, was preferred and associated with higher
   growth rates of O. tuberculata. However, it is necessary to emphasize
   that the low phlorotannins concentrations registered in the three
   macroalgae species examined in this study, may not have been sufficient
   to deter O. tuberculata. When the amphipods were fed with each alga
   individually, they consumed significantly higher quantities of D.
   antarctica, which suggests that O. tuberculata did not eat more to
   compensate for the lower nutritional quality of the other algal species
   in order to maintain growth. Nor was compensation for lower food quality
   achieved by increasing absorption efficiency. Our results imply that the
   composition of the macroalgae arriving on the beach can significantly
   affect the performance and subsequent life history traits of O.
   tuberculata and by extension other amphipod species.}},

Abstract = {{The principal advances in understanding of the molecular genetics of
   migraine come from studies of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), a rare
   migraine variant with aura, which has autosomal dominant inheritance.
   Three genes have been identified, all of which code for ion
   transporters. In cellular models and in transgenic mice, mutations
   causing FHM result in neuronal hyperexcitability, thus facilitating the
   triggering of waves of cortical spreading depression, the phenomenon
   which underlies the migrainous aura. Large numbers of linkage analysis
   and association studies in the most common forms of migraine, whether
   with or without aura, have yielded inconclusive results. This is
   probably due to the clinical heterogeneity of migraine. New methods of
   phenotype analysis and of exploration of association over the whole
   genome now seem to offer the best chance of identifying the genes of

Title = {{Impact of platelet transfusion on hematoma expansion in patients
   receiving antiplatelet agents before intracerebral hemorrhage}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Patients receiving antiplatelet medications are reported to
   be at increased risk for hematoma enlargement and worse clinical
   outcomes following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). While platelet
   transfusions are frequently administered to counteract qualitative
   platelet defects in the setting of ICH, conclusive evidence in support
   of this therapeutic strategy is lacking. In fact, platelet transfusions
   may be associated with adverse effects, and represent a finite resource.
   We sought to determine the clinical efficacy of platelet transfusion and
   its impact on systemic complications following ICH in a cohort of
   patients receiving antiplatelet medications.
   Methods: We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 66 patients
   admitted to our institution from June 2003 to July 2008 who suffered a
   primary ICH while receiving antiplatelet (acetylsalicylic acid and/or
   clopidogrel) therapy. The primary outcome was the rate of significant
   (>25\% increase from admission) hematoma expansion in transfused (n=535)
   versus non-transfused (n=531) patients. Discharge modified-Rankin score
   (mRS) and the rates of systemic complications were also assessed.
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences in rates of
   hematoma expansion between cohorts, nor were there differences in
   demographic variables, systemic complications or discharge mRS. Subgroup
   analysis revealed that there was a higher rate of hematoma expansion in
   the clopidogrel cohort (p=0.034) than in the cohort of patients
   receiving aspirin alone.
   Discussion: This study suggests that platelet administration does not
   reduce the frequency of hematoma expansion in ICH patients receiving
   antiplatelet medications. This lack of efficacy may relate to
   transfusion timing, as a significant proportion of hematoma expansion
   occurs within 6 hours post-ictus. Additionally, the increased rates of
   hematoma expansion in the clopidogrel cohort may relate to its prolonged
   half-life. A larger, prospective study is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF), which prevalence increases with age, is a
   growing public health problem and a well known risk factor for stroke.
   On the other hand, dementia is one of the most important neurological
   disorders in the elderly, and with aging of the population in developed
   countries, the number of demented patients will increase in absence of
   prevention. In the past decade, several vascular risk factors
   (hypertension, obesity and metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia)
   have been found, with various degree of evidence, to be associated with
   vascular dementia but also, surprisingly, with Alzheimer's disease. This
   review is devoted to the links between atrial fibrillation, cognitive
   decline and dementia. Globally, transversal studies showed a significant
   association between atrial fibrillation, cognitive decline and dementia.
   However, these studies are particularly sensitive to various biases. In
   this context, recent longitudinal studies of higher level of evidence
   have been conducted to assess the link between AF and dementia. One
   study disclosed a high incidence of dementia among patients suffering
   from atrial fibrillation during a 4.6 years follow-up. Similarly another
   study showed that atrial fibrillation was significantly associated with
   conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia during a 3 years
   follow-up. Nevertheless two other longitudinal studies did not find any
   significant association between AF and dementia, but this discrepancy
   should be interpreted taking into account that the comparability of all
   these studies is moderate because they were using different
   methodologies (population, cognitive testing, and mean follow-up).
   Possible explanatory mechanisms for the association between AF and the
   risk of dementia are proposed, such as thrombo-embolic ischemic damage
   and cerebral hypo perfusion due to fluctuations in the cardiac output.
   Thus, there is some evidence that FA could be associated with cognitive
   decline and dementia but this link should be supported by more powerful
   long term longitudinal studies.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In object-substitution masking (OSM), a sparse, common-onset mask
   impairs perception of a target when the mask's offset is later than the
   target's offset and spatial attention is dispersed. OSM is thought to
   reflect the interaction of feed-forward and reentrant processes in the
   brain: Upon stimulus presentation, a low-resolution representation of
   the target and mask progresses from sensory to anterior brain regions,
   triggering reentrant processing to confirm stimulus identity. It is
   hypothesized that dispersing spatial attention prolongs the required
   reentrant iterations, increasing the likelihood that only the lingering
   mask stimulus will remain physically present and thus substitute for the
   target in consciousness. However, empirically, it remains unclear
   whether substitution stems from delayed feed-forward or reentrant
   processing. Here, we demonstrate that delayed reentrant processing
   causes OSM, by showing that a task tapping high-level brain regions
   involved in reentrant processing leads to a spatially attended target
   being replaced by the mask. Our results confirm a key role for reentrant
   processing in conscious perception.}},

   high-mass (greater than or similar to 10(11) M-circle dot) systems. On
   average, low-mass systems exhibit a dominant late burst of star
   formation which creates a large fraction of their stellar mass.
   Conversely, high-mass systems tend to have a significant amount of
   stellar mass that formed much earlier. We also find that the high-mass
   SFHs evolve more strongly than the low-mass SFHs. These findings are
   consistent with the phenomenon of downsizing observed in optically

Abstract = {{The aim of this ex post facto study was to investigate the predictors of
   refusal, dropout and therapeutic failure among men attending a community
   batterer treatment program. The sample consisted of 451 abusive men who
   voluntarily sought therapeutic help in the last ten years (1997-2007).
   The intervention program was a structured, intensive, 20-week,
   individual treatment based on cognitive-behavioral therapy. According to
   a logistic regression model, the refusal of therapy (n = 255; 56.1\%)
   was higher when batterer men were immigrants and when the victims were
   not also in treatment in an integral approach. Participants dropped out
   of the program (n = 88; 45\%) more easily when they were unemployed and
   when the victim was not also in treatment. In turn, therapeutic failure
   in treatment completers (n = 13; 13.7\%) was strongly associated with
   low empathy and with lack of adjustment to everyday life. Finally, there
   were no clear predictors of loss of subjects (n = 44; 46.3\%) in the
   12-month follow-up. Implications of the current findings for further
   research in the field of batterer treatment are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Long range atmospheric transport and deposition is a significant
   introduction pathway of organic pollutants to remote oceanic regions,
   leading to their subsequent accumulation in marine organisms. Persistent
   organic pollutants (POPs) bioconcentrate in planktonic food webs and
   these exert a biogeochemical control on the regional and global cycling
   of POPs. Therefore, an important issue is to determine whether the
   anthropogenic chemical perturbation of the biosphere introduced by the
   myriad of organic pollutants present in seawater influences
   phytoplankton abundance and productivity. The results reported here from
   five sets of experiments performed in the NE Atlantic Ocean show that
   there is a toxic effect induced by trace levels of complex mixtures of
   organic pollutants on phytoplankton oceanic communities. The levels of
   single pollutant, such as phenanthrene and pyrene, at which lethality of
   phytoplankton is observed are high in comparison to field levels.
   Complex mixtures of organic pollutants, however, have an important toxic
   effect on phytoplankton abundances, viability and concentrations of
   Chlorophyll a at pollutant concentrations 20-40 folds those found in the
   open ocean. The toxicity of these complex mixtures of organic pollutants
   exceeds by 103 times the toxicity expected for a single pollutant.
   Therefore, our results point out the need for a systematic investigation
   of the influence of complex mixtures of organic hydrophobic pollutants
   to oceanic phytoplankton communities, a perturbation not accounted for
   on previous assessments of anthropogenic pressures in the marine
   environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Quarantine nematodes in Swiss vegetable growing
   Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are the most important group of
   plant-parasitic nematodes in Switzerland causing significant problems in
   vegetable production areas. The most common root-knot nematode species
   is Meloidogyne hapla, followed by the tropical and subtropical species
   M. incognita, M. arenaria and M. javanica, which are found in
   greenhouses only. In surveys conducted in the years 2002 to 2006, the
   quarantine nematodes M. chitwoodi and M. fallax were found in
   greenhouses in Switzerland. However, they were confined to a few
   greenhouses only and have not yet spread further confirming that the
   phytosanitary measures were successfully implemented. From 2006 to 2008,
   only M. fallax could be identified in samples from infested greenhouses
   and heated plastic tunnels. An intensive survey conducted in 2009 and
   2010 confirmed the absence of M. chitwoodi. The species M. fallax was
   still present in greenhouses and heated tunnels, but unheated plastic
   tunnels or open fields adjacent to the infested greenhouse proved to be
   free of quarantine nematodes.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral edema is a feared complication to acute liver failure (ALF),
   but the pathogenesis is still poorly understood. The water channels
   Aquaporin-1 (Aqp1) and -4 (Aqp4) has been associated with brain edema
   formation in several neuropathological conditions, indicating a possible
   role of Aqp1 and/or Aqp4 in ALF mediated brain edema. We induced acute
   liver injury and hyperammonemia in mice, to evaluate brain edema
   formation and the parallel expression of Aqp1 and Aqp4 in ALF. Liver
   injury and hyperammonemia were induced by +D-galactosamine (GLN) plus
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally and intravenous
   ammonia-acetate (NH4 (+)), the GLN+LPS+NH4 (+) group. The vehicle
   control group (CONTROL) was treated with NaCl and phosphate-buffered
   saline. The GLN+LPS+NH4 (+) group showed significantly elevated
   p-alanine aminotransferase, p-INR and p-ammonium vs. CONTROL (p <
   0.001). Cortical brain water content was significantly elevated in the
   GLN+LPS+NH4 (+) group vs. CONTROL, mean (SEM) 80.8(0.3) vs 80.0(0.1) \%
   (p < 0.05). Western blot of membrane enriched cortical brain tissue
   showed significantly upregulation of Aqp4 in the GLN+LPS+NH4 (+) group
   vs. CONTROL, mean AU (SEM) 100775(14820) vs. 58857(6266) (p < 0.05), and
   stationary levels for Aqp1. Aqp1 and Aqp4 mRNA were stationary. This
   study indicates that Aqp4, but not Aqp1, may be of importance in the
   pathogenesis of cortical brain edema in mice with ALF.}},

   VSC: controlling each part individually while the other was set to a
   constant value and controlling both parts together using the same
   algorithm. Three different control algorithms such as proportional,
   integral, differential (PID), fuzzy logic and Artificial Neural Network
   (ANN) were experimented. In the first case, PID controller presented
   reasonable control solution for more stable SH and T-wo values in the
   steady state. In the second case, ANN controller pair was selected to
   achieve minimum power consumption and more stable SH and T-wo values
   against to a disturbance. In this manner, ANN controller showed lower
   power consumption of 8.1 percent and 6.6 percent than both PhD and Fuzzy

Abstract = {{One option for using organs from donors with a suboptimal nephron mass,
   e.g. expanded criteria donors (ECD) kidneys, is dual kidney
   transplantation (DKT). In adult recipients, DKT can be carried out by
   several techniques, but the unilateral placement of both kidneys (UDKT)
   offers the advantages of single surgical access and shorter operating
   time. One hundred UDKT were performed using kidneys from ECD donors with
   a mean age of 72 years (Group 1). The technique consists of
   transplanting both kidneys extraperitoneally in the same iliac fossa.
   The results were compared with a cohort of single kidney transplants
   (SKT) performed with the same selection criteria in the same study
   period (Group 2, n = 73). Ninety-five percent of UDKTs were positioned
   in the right iliac fossa, lengthening the right renal vein with an
   inferior vena cava patch. In 69\% of cases, all anastomoses were to the
   external iliac vessels end-to-side. Surgical complications were
   comparable in both groups. At 3-year follow-up, patient and graft
   survival rates were 95.6 and 90.9\% in Group 1, respectively. UDKT can
   be carried out with comparable surgical complication rates as SKT,
   leaving the contralateral iliac fossa untouched and giving elderly
   recipients a better chance of receiving a transplant, with optimal
   results up to 3-years follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Clinical trials are assessing the efficacy of
   fibrinolysis in extended time windows for acute ischemic stroke.
   Methods-An Internet-based survey was sent to 400 US vascular
   neurologists affiliated with a university to assess whether there are
   consensus opinions on how they treat patients beyond 3 hours from
   symptom onset and which patients they are willing to enroll into
   clinical trials of fibrinolysis for acute ischemic stroke.
   Results-We received 161 responses; 81\% were male. Ninety-three percent
   of respondents treat patients with intravenous tissue plasminogen
   activator beyond 3 hours. More than 80\% were treated beyond 3 hours
   with intra-arterial therapy (IAT). When asked if IAT improves stroke
   outcome, >50\% selected the choice of ``yes for middle cerebral artery
   and basilar occlusions{''} and only 2\% selected the choice that ``IAT
   does not improve outcome.{''} Over half believe that imaging could be
   used to approximate the penumbra but with improvements to better
   identify salvageable tissue. Eighty-seven percent were willing to enroll
   patients into a placebo-controlled intravenous thrombolysis beyond 3
   hours. For IAT trials, >80\% would randomize beyond 3 hours with or
   without prior intravenous treatment.
   Conclusions-Vascular neurologists have been treating acute ischemic
   stroke beyond 3 hours with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator even
   before the American Heart Association guidelines supported extending the
   therapeutic window. There is a paradox among the respondents willing to
   enroll patients into trials involving IAT given that a majority is
   offering IAT as part of their practice. These results suggest that
   clinical practice may impair enrollment into trials testing reperfusion
   therapies for acute ischemic stroke. (Stroke. 2010;41:2038-2043.)}},

Abstract = {{Muscle cramps are not uncommon complications of hemodialysis (HD)
   treatments and lead to early termination of HD sessions and are
   therefore a significant cause of under-dialysis. The etiology of cramps
   in dialysis patients remains a matter of debate. Many reports suggested
   that vitamin E (vit. E) may be effective for the prevention of
   HD-associated cramps. We decided to perform a selected controlled trial
   of supplementary vit. E for treatment of patients on HD who experience
   frequent attacks during and between HD sessions. The goal was to compare
   the number of attacks of muscle cramps with the patient's baseline over
   a specific period of time. In this study, 19 HD patients were randomly
   selected of different age groups and ethnicity. Patient must have had at
   least 60 attacks of muscle cramps during and between HD sessions over a
   12-week period. All selected patients received vit. E at a dose of 400
   international units daily for 12 weeks, and the number of attacks of
   muscle cramps was recorded. The frequency of muscle cramps decreased
   significantly during vit. E therapy, and, at the end of the trial, vit.
   E led to cramp reductions of 68.3\%. The reduction in number of attacks
   of muscle cramps had no significant correlation with age, sex, etiology
   of end-stage renal disease, serum electrolytes, or HD duration, and it
   showed a statistically positive correlation (P = 0.0001) with vit. E
   therapy. No vit. E-related adverse effects were encountered during the
   trial. Shortterm treatment with vit. E is safe and effective in reducing
   number of attacks of muscle cramps in HD patients, as shown in our
   study.}},

Abstract = {{The present investigation was undertaken with the objective of
   formulating orodispersible film(s) of the antidepressant drug tianeptine
   sodium to enhance the convenience and compliance by the elderly and
   pediatric patients. The novel film former, lycoat NG73 (granular
   hydroxypropyl starch), along with different film-forming agents
   (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and polyvinyl
   alcohol), in addition to three film modifiers; namely, maltodextrin,
   polyvinyl pyrrolidone K90 and lycoat RS780 (pregelatinized hydroxypropyl
   starch) were evaluated. Eight formulae were prepared by the
   solvent-casting method; and were evaluated for their in vitro
   dissolution characteristics, in vitro disintegration time, and their
   physico-mechanical properties. The promising orodispersible film based
   on lycoat NG73 (F1); showing the greatest drug dissolution, satisfactory
   in vitro disintegration time and physico-mechanical properties that are
   suitable for orodispersible films, was evaluated for its bioavailability
   compared with a reference marketed product (Stablon (R) tablets) in
   rabbits. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between
   the bioavailability parameters (C(max) (ng/ml), t(max) (h), AUC(0-t) (ng
   h ml(-1)), and AUC(0-infinity) (ng h ml(-1))] of the test film (F1) and
   the reference product. The mean ratio values (test/reference) of C(max)
   (89.74\%), AUC(0-t) (110.9\%), and AUC(0-infinity) (109.21\%) indicated
   that the two formulae exhibited comparable plasma level-time profiles.
   These findings suggest that the fast orodispersible film containing
   tianeptine is likely to become one of choices for acute treatment of
   depression.}},

Title = {{Temporal trend of in-hospital major bleeding among patients with non

Journal = {{AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{160}},

Pages = {{420-427}},

Abstract = {{Background Although randomized controlled trials support the use of
   intensive medical and invasive therapies for non-ST segment elevation
   acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS), major bleeding is a serious
   treatment complication. We sought to determine the temporal trend of
   in-hospital major bleeding among patients with NSTE-ACS, in relation to
   the evolving management pattern.
   Methods We identified 14 111 NSTE-ACS patients enrolled in 4 successive,
   prospective, multicenter registries (ACS I, 1999-2001; ACS II,
   2002-2003; GRACE, 2004-2007; and CANRACE, 2008) in Canada between 1999
   and 2008. We collected data on patient characteristics, use of cardiac
   medications and procedures on standardized case report forms. In all
   registries, major bleeding was defined a priori as life threatening or
   fatal bleeding, bleeding requiring transfusion of >= 2 U of packed red
   cells, or resulting in an absolute decrease in hemoglobin of > 30g/L.
   Results A total of 14 111 patients had a final diagnosis of NSTE-ACS and
   were included in this study (3294 in the ACS-I registry, 1956 in the
   ACS-II registry, 7543 in GRACE, and 1318 in CANRACE). Over time, there
   was a substantial increase in the use of dual anti-platelet (aspirin and
   thienopyridine) therapy (P for trend <.001), and in rates of in-hospital
   cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (both Ps
   for trend <.001). Overall, major bleeding was relatively infrequent
   (1.7\%). There was no significant increase in the unadjusted rates of
   major bleeding over time (P for trend = .19). In multivariable analysis
   adjusting for GRACE risk score and intensive treatment, enrolment period
   was not an independent predictor of bleeding (P for trend = .98). There
   was no interaction between the enrolment period and the use of intensive
   medical and invasive management.
   Conclusion Despite more widespread use of dual anti-platelet therapies
   and invasive cardiac procedures in the management of NSTE-ACS, the rate
   of major bleeding remains relatively low and has not increased
   significantly over time. Our findings suggest that physicians
   selectively target treatment for their patients, and these
   evidence-based therapies can be safely administered to ACS patients in
   clinical practice. (Am Heart J 2010;160:420-7.)}},

Abstract = {{The usefulness of a specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on recombinant GRA6
   antigen for distinguishing between acute and chronic Toxoplasma
   infection was investigated. Two sets of serum samples obtained from
   pregnant women with acute, chronic, or no Toxoplasma infection collected
   in France and Iran were used. Among the French subjects, 19 of 20 (95\%)
   women who experienced seroconversion during the past 4 months before
   sampling displayed low-avidity IgG antibodies against GRA6, while all 17
   (100\%) women with chronic infection had high-avidity antibodies. When
   the Euroimmun IgG avidity ELISA was used, 15 of 19 (78.9\%) recently
   infected women had low-avidity antibodies, and 20 of 22 (90.9\%) women
   with chronic infection displayed high-avidity antibodies. The results
   suggested better performance of the GRA6 avidity ELISA than the
   Euroimmun avidity ELISA for exclusion of a recent infection occurring
   less than 4 months previously. Similarly, all 35 Iranian women with
   acute Toxoplasma infection had low-avidity antibodies against GRA6,
   whereas all 34 women with chronic infection displayed IgG antibodies of
   high avidity, indicating the value of GRA6 avidity testing for ruling
   out a recent infection. Avidity tests based on lysed whole-cell
   Toxoplasma gondii antigen are currently used to exclude recently
   acquired infections; however, the use of recombinant antigen(s) might
   improve the diagnostic performance of avidity tests and facilitate the
   development of more standardized assays.}},

Title = {{The relationship between Developmental Co-ordination Disorders, child's

Journal = {{CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{36}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Developmental Co-ordination Disorder (DCD) may negatively impact
   children's self-efficacy and limit their performance and participation
   in school as well as in leisure activities performed after school hours.
   However, a lack of information exists regarding the relationships
   between DCD, child's self-efficacy and participation. Moreover, the
   literature about the way children with DCD experience these limitations
   and report about them is scarce. This study aimed to compare the
   perceived self-efficacy and the preference to participate in leisure
   activities of children with DCD and typical peers and to illuminate the
   relationship between self-efficacy, activity preference and DCD
   severity.
   Methods
   Participants were 37 children with DCD and 37 typical peers, aged
   5.08-9.83 years. All children performed the Movement Assessment Battery
   for Children, the Perceived Efficacy and Goal Setting System and the
   Preference for Activities of Children.
   Results
   The scores of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children confirmed the
   motor gaps between the two groups. Children with DCD scored
   significantly lower in self-efficacy on all the Perceived Efficacy and
   Goal Setting System subscales and demonstrated a lower preference to
   participate in leisure activities according to all scales of the
   Preference for Activities of Children. The lower their self-efficacy,
   the lower their motor performance and their preference to participate in
   activities.
   Conclusions
   Children's preference to participate in activities may be limited by
   motor difficulties, but further hindered by low self-efficacy. Early
   identification of DCD and associated negative outcomes, also based on
   child's self-reports, should receive special attention in intervention
   programmes in order to enhance children's self-confidence, feelings of
   belonging, optimal development and participation in daily activities.}},

Abstract = {{Formation of intra-and intermolecular disulfide bonds is an essential
   step in the synthesis of secretory proteins. In eukaryotic cells, this
   process occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and requires an
   oxidative environment with the action of several chaperones and folding
   catalysts. During protein folding, Ero1p oxidizes protein disulfide
   isomerase (PDI), which then directly catalyzes the formation of
   disulfide bonds in folding proteins. Recent cell-free studies suggest
   that the terminal electron acceptor in the pathway is molecular oxygen,
   with the resulting formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We report for
   the first time the measurement of ER H2O2 level in live cells. By
   targeting a fluorescent protein-based H2O2 sensor to various
   intracellular compartments, we show that the ER has the highest level of
   H2O2, and this high concentration is well confined to the lumen of the
   organelle. Manipulation of the Ero1-La level-either by overexpression or
   by siRNA-mediated inhibition-caused parallel changes in luminal H2O2,
   proving that the activity of Ero1-La results in H2O2 formation in the
   ER. We also found that calcium mobilization from intracellular stores
   induces a decrease in ER H2O2 level, suggesting a complex interplay
   between redox and calcium signaling in the mammalian ER. Antioxid. Redox

Journal = {{PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{646-652}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Our objectives were to characterize resident knowledge of
   bag-mask ventilation (BMV) and to identify predictors of a
   well-developed mental model of BMV.
   Methods: A pilot survey of airway experts identified 6 steps considered
   essential in situations of difficult BMV. Subsequently, residents from
   pediatric, emergency medicine, and medicine-pediatric programs at a
   tertiary care hospital completed the same pediatric scenario-based item
   given to airway experts.
   Results: Of all surveys, 75\% (n = 103) were completed. No resident
   identified all 6 maneuvers for difficult BMV. With decreasing frequency,
   the items identified were as follows: reposition patient/airway (82\%),
   oral airway (61\%), nasal airway (39\%), jaw thrust (37\%), 2-person
   technique (7\%), and call for help (4\%). Emergency medicine residents
   had a higher mean (SD) score than the medicine-pediatric and pediatric
   residents of a possible 6 (2.71 (1.26) vs 2.01 (1.07), P = 0.004) and
   were significantly more likely to identify certain maneuvers: oral
   airway (81\% vs 52\%, P = 0.006), nasal airway (57\% vs 29\%, P =
   0.006), and 2-person technique (14\% vs 3\%, P = 0.042). Only 15\% of
   all residents were able to identify 4 or more essential maneuvers.
   Higher level of training was associated with identifying the 2-person
   technique. In addition, residents who completed 1 month of pediatric or
   adult anesthesia were more likely to identify use of nasal airway, oral
   airway and 2-person technique, and to identify 4 or more maneuvers.
   Conclusions: Emergency medicine residents identified more steps to
   optimize difficult BMV, although most residents exhibited a poorly
   developed mental model for difficult BMV compared with the consistent
   mental model of airway experts. Future research should investigate
   strategies for improving residents' mental model of BMV and its impact
   on patient care.}},

Abstract = {{P>The goal of the present study was to investigate arousal thresholds
   (ATs) in tonic and phasic episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,
   and to compare the frequency spectrum of these sub-states of REM to
   non-REM (NREM) stages of sleep. We found the two REM stages to differ
   with regard to behavioural responses to external acoustic stimuli. The
   AT in tonic REM was indifferent from that in sleep stage 2, and ATs in
   phasic REM were similar to those in slow-wave sleep (stage 4). NREM and
   REM stages of similar behavioural thresholds were distinctly different
   with regard to their frequency pattern. These data provide further
   evidence that REM sleep should not be regarded a uniform state.
   Regarding electroencephalogram frequency spectra, we found that the two
   REM stages were more similar to each other than to NREM stages with
   similar responsivity. Ocular activity such as
   ponto-geniculo-occipital-like waves and microsaccades are discussed as
   likely modulators of behavioural responsiveness and cortical processing
   of auditory information in the two REM sub-states.}},

Abstract = {{Atorvastatin is commonly used as a cholesterol lowering agent in
   patients. Recently, the neuroprotective effects of atorvastatin became
   the focus of many research studies. In this study, we have formulated
   chitosan microspheres containing atorvastatin calcium. In-vitro
   characterization of chitosan microspheres and quantification of
   atorvastatin calcium from formulations were also evaluated. The
   neuroprotective efficiency of atorvastatin calcium was investigated by
   an experimental spinal cord injury model. Atorvastatin calcium
   microspheres were implanted at the laminectomy area (1 mg/kg)
   immediately after trauma. Twenty-four hours after injury, motor
   functions of animals were scored according to modified Tarlov Scale. In
   spinal cord tissues tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin
   (IL)-1 beta, IL-6 and lipid peroxidation levels were quantified and
   ultrastructural changes have been investigated. The results of all
   parameters indicate that microspheres containing atorvastatin calcium
   were capable of improving functional outcome, attenuating the expression
   of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6; lowering lipid peroxidation levels and
   maintaining the preservation of the cellular uniformity.}},

Abstract = {{We report on atomic gas (Hi) and molecular gas (as traced by CO(2-1))
   redshifted absorption features toward the nuclear regions of the closest
   powerful radio galaxy, Centaurus A (NGC 5128). Our Hi observations using
   the Very Long Baseline Array allow us to discern with unprecedented
   sub-parsec resolution Hi absorption profiles toward different positions
   along the 21 cm continuum jet in the inner 0 `'.3 (or 5.4 pc). In
   addition, our CO(2-1) data obtained with the Submillimeter Array probe
   the bulk of the absorbing molecular gas with little contamination by
   emission, which was not possible with previous CO single-dish
   observations. We shed light on the physical properties of the gas in the
   line of sight with these data, emphasizing the still open debate about
   the nature of the gas that produces the broad absorption line (similar
   to 55 km s(-1)). First, the broad Hi line is more prominent toward the
   central and brightest 21 cm continuum component than toward a region
   along the jet at a distance similar to 20 mas (or 0.4 pc) further from
   the nucleus. This indicates that the broad absorption line arises from
   gas located close to the nucleus, rather than from diffuse and more
   distant gas. Second, the different velocity components detected in the
   CO(2-1) absorption spectrum match well with other molecular lines, such
   as those of HCO+(1-0), except the broad absorption line that is detected
   in HCO+(1-0) (and most likely related to that of the HI). Dissociation
   of molecular hydrogen due to the active galactic nucleus seems to be
   efficient at distances r less than or similar to 10 pc, which might
   contribute to the depth of the broad Hi and molecular lines.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to estimate the phenotypic divergence in wine grapes
   based on 11 agronomic variables. Two contrasting groups. both for white
   as for red grapes, were formed by principal component analysis. In white
   grapes. greatest divergence was observed in the accessions Baco Blanc,
   Campanario and Palomino. In red grapes. the most divergent were Ammon
   and Tannat; Castelao and Mars. The standardized Euclidean distance
   indicated 52.4 and 40.0\% white and red grape accessions. respectively,
   with means exceeding the overall mean. By UPGMA, four major groups were
   formed for white and red grapes. Both principal component analysis and
   UPGMA showed that the genealogy of the accessions Petite Sirah FR and
   Petite Sirah RS is similar The accessions with most divergence in the
   traits studied should be used to produce hybrids. as well as for
   selection of accessions with a view to regional wine making.}},

Abstract = {{Time resolved Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) experiments were
   carried out to investigate turbulent, subcooled boiling flow of
   refrigerant HFE-301 through a vertical rectangular channel with one
   heated wall. Measurements were performed with liquid Reynolds numbers
   (based on the hydraulic diameter) of Re = 3309, 9929 and 16,549 over a
   wall heat flux range of 0.0-64.0 kW/m(2). Turbulence statistics are
   inferred from PTV full-field velocity measurements. Quantities such as:
   instantaneous 2D velocity fields, time-averaged axial and normal
   velocities, axial and normal turbulence intensities, and Reynolds
   stresses are obtained. The present results agree well with previous
   studies and provides new information due to the full-field nature of the
   technique. This work is an attempt to provide turbulent subcooled
   boiling flow data for validation and improvement of two-phase flow
   computational models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the safety aspects of carers' enteral feeding
   technique when home enteral tube feeding children with inherited
   metabolic disorders (IMD).
   Methods 40 patients (median age, 5.1 years; range, 0.3-13.6 years) with
   IMD requiring pump tube feeding were recruited. 12 patients had glycogen
   storage disease, 11 organic acidemias, 8 fatty acid oxidation disorders,
   4 urea cycle disorders, and 5 had other conditions. 50\% of the patients
   were fed by gastrostomy and 50\% nasogastric tube. A questionnaire and
   practical assessment of feeding process was completed with carers by a
   dietician and nurse in the child's home. Areas investigated included
   carer hygiene, feed preparation, tube care, tube changing, use of
   feeding pumps and equipment, and storage of enteral feeding equipment.
   Results The main issues identified were poor hygiene practices (78\%
   unclean work surfaces; 25\% no hand washing); inaccurate ingredient
   measuring (40\%); irregular checking of tube position (40\%); inadequate
   tube flushing (50\%); poor knowledge of how to clear tube blockages
   (80\%); incorrect priming of pump sets (50\%); incorrect position of
   child for night feeding (63\%); untrained secondary carers (43\%); and
   poor knowledge of pump alarms, battery life, and charging time. Children
   commonly slept in parent's room as a safety precaution (58\%).
   Conclusions Long term follow-up of children with IMD on home enteral
   tube feeding suggests that regular updates on knowledge and technique
   for carers may be necessary to reduce risk.}},

Abstract = {{We present scintillation calculations in weak atmospheric turbulence for
   partially coherent general beams based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel
   integral and a Matlab function designed to handle expressions both of
   the average intensity and the average squared intensity. This way, the
   integrations are performed in a semi-analytic manner by the associated
   Matlab function, and this avoids lengthy, time-consuming and error prone
   hand derivations. The results are obtained for the partially coherent
   fundamental and higher-order sinusoidal and annular Gaussian beams. By
   plotting the scintillation index against the propagation distance and
   source size, we illustrate the on-axis scintillation behaviors of these
   beams. Accordingly, it is found that within specific source and
   parameter ranges, partially coherent fundamental, higher-order
   sinusoidal and annular Gaussian beams are capable of offering less
   scintillations, in comparison to the fundamental Gaussian beam.}},

Abstract = {{The presence and activity of deoxyribonucleases (DNases) in the cortex

   investigated. Maximum enzyme activity in the sponge homogenate was
   detected at pH values of 4.27, 7.0, and 8.5-8.75. Among different
   specimens, several distinct patterns of neutral DNase isozymes were
   observed in the cortex region. In each investigated specimen, the
   highest neutral DNase activity was associated with high molecular weight
   proteins (up to75 kDa). The acid DNases showed a low level of activity.
   In the endosome, the acid DNase activity was up to 10 times higher than
   in the cortex and the presence of a DNase II-like protein was detected.
   Neutral DNase exhibiting the highest activity in all investigated
   specimens had a molecular weight of 20 kDa and belonged to the DNase
   I-like family. The results indicate that the activity of neutral and
   acid DNases is related to the region of the sponge and its biological
   functions. The cortex region communicating with the environment showed a
   high interindividual variability and heterogeneity of neutral DNases,
   while the endosome, where the intracellular digestion occurs, is a site
   of high acid DNase activity.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective:
   A pooled analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of varenicline
   versus placebo for smoking cessation in Asian populations. A secondary
   objective was to compare the data to pooled trials among predominantly
   Western populations.
   Research design and methods:
   Smokers (n = 893) in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
   multicenter, phase IIb or III trials conducted in six Asian countries
   (Japan, Taiwan, Korea, China, Singapore, and Thailand), received
   varenicline (1 mg twice daily; n = 447) or placebo (n = 446) for 12
   weeks. Non-treatment follow-up lasted 12 weeks (40 weeks in Japan).
   Primary endpoint was the carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence
   rate (CAR) for weeks 9-12 (last 4 weeks of treatment). Secondary
   endpoint was CAR for weeks 9-24.
   Results:
   CAR was higher for varenicline than placebo during weeks 9-12 (58.6 vs.
   34.3\%; odds ratio {[}OR]: 2.74; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]:
   2.08-3.60; p < 0.0001), and through 12 weeks of follow-up (CAR weeks
   9-24; 41.4 vs. 25.3\%; OR: 2.08; 95\% CI: 1.56-2.77; p < 0.0001). The
   most frequent adverse events (AEs) in the varenicline group (greater
   incidence than the placebo group) were: nausea (31.5\%), headache
   (8.5\%), dizziness (7.8\%), insomnia (7.4\%), and upper abdominal pain
   (5.4\%). Serious AEs occurred in four varenicline and five placebo
   participants. Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 3.6\% of
   varenicline and 1.6\% of placebo participants. Compared with the Western
   studies, abstinence rates for both varenicline and placebo were
   numerically higher in the Asian studies, although treatment effects were
   similar between the two populations. AEs reported in the Asian trials
   were largely similar to those in the Western populations.
   Conclusions:
   Varenicline significantly improved smoking abstinence in Asian
   populations from six countries. AEs were predominantly of mild or
   moderate intensity. These data were largely the same as those seen in
   Western populations, but the studies were not designed to explore racial
   or cultural differences.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Most cases of cervical cancer are associated with human papillomavirus
   (HPV) types 16 and 18. This study examined the effect of message framing
   on mother's intentions to obtain HPV vaccination for their teenage
   daughters and investigated predictors of HPV vaccination intentions.
   Methods
   Seventy-two mothers of daughters in the 8-16-year age group were
   randomly assigned to read either a gain-framed (describing the benefits
   of receiving the vaccine) or a loss-framed (describing the costs of not
   receiving the vaccine) message and completed measures assessing their
   intention to have their daughter/s vaccinated, normative beliefs,
   attitudes and perceived behavioural control.
   Conclusions
   Awareness of HPV was low but intentions to vaccinate were high. There
   was no effect of message frame on vaccination intentions. Attitudes
   towards HPV vaccination and the influence of both peers and medical
   professionals are important factors in HPV vaccine acceptability.}},

Abstract = {{A Bi-22at.\%Sb alloy was water-quenched from 973 K; its microstructure
   was dendritic with primary Sb-rich arms up to 50 mu m in diameter. The
   cast alloy was first rolled to tape, then cut into equal lengths and
   subjected to multiple roll bonding (MRB) processes. The evolution of the
   microstructure during deformation was followed by optical microscopy,
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field-emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FESEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and x-ray
   diffraction analysis. After three MRB cycles, an overall area reduction
   ratio of 4 x 10(3) was achieved. Due to the relatively low process
   temperature, a relevant fraction of dendrites was preserved. Plastic
   strain caused dendritic arms to elongate in the rolling direction and to
   flatten in the transverse direction. As a result of different starting
   size and orientation, the dendritic arms were transformed into Sb-rich
   inclusions of various shapes and dimensions at the end of the MRB
   process. In particular, inclusions with a transverse size down to 20 nm
   were observed.}},

Abstract = {{A bacterial strain capable of utilizing dibutyl phthalate (DBP) as its
   sole source of carbon and energy was isolated from municipal solid waste
   in a landfill bioreactor. Based on its morphology, physiochemical
   characteristics, and 165 rDNA sequence, the strain was identified as
   Enterobacter sp. T5. Microbial degradation of DBP was studied for
   several environmental factors. The optimal pH and temperature for its
   biodegradation activities were 7.0 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The
   effect of initial DBP concentrations on the degradation was investigated
   between 100 and 1500 mg l(-1). The results showed that the degradation
   fit a first-order kinetic model, and the degradation half-life was about
   20.9 h when the concentration of DBP was lower than 1000 mg l(-1). The
   major DBP degradation products by Enterobacter sp. T5 were preliminarily
   identified as PA and MBP. Enterobacter sp. T5 also grew with dimethyl
   phthalate, diethyl phthalate or dioctyl phthalate solution as the sole
   source of carbon and energy, which suggested its ability to resist
   phthalic acid diester (PAE) toxicities. These results suggested that
   Enterobacter sp. T5 could be used as a candidate for remediating
   PAE-containing wastes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear chemical fingerprinting is a new technique for analyzing
   traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). We developed such a method and
   applied it to Glycyrrhiza, a significant TCM. Nonlinear chemical
   fingerprints were obtained for Glycyrrhiza from four different
   production areas, and for 14 other TCMs with similar induction time. The
   calculation of their similarities was based on similarity system theory.
   Using intuitive visual comparison of the data and the similarity
   calculation results, Glycyrrhiza was discriminated from the 14 other
   TCMs. There was a linear relationship between the content of active TCM
   components and the induction time. This was used to compare the content
   of active components in Glycyrrhiza from the four different production
   areas, and establish an equivalent-dose relationship for these four
   samples. This method provides a new tool for discrimination and
   evaluation of Glycyrrhiza, and a dosage reference for clinical
   application of Glycyrrhiza from the four regions studied.}},

   of triglyceride polymers (TGP), triglyceride dimers (TGD), oxidised
   triglyceride monomers (oxTGM), diglycerides (DG), and free fatty acids
   (FFA) during frying. The ability of the USM to resist the TGP formation
   was higher than that of the TBHQ. The USM and TBHQ showed lower

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Helical tomotherapy (HT, Hi-Art TomoTherapy (R))
   is a recently developed radiation device delivering highly conformal
   dose with a rotational gantry resulting in more uniform target doses and
   better avoidance of organs at risk. Treatment failure patterns in head
   and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated with HT were analyzed.
   Patients and Methods: 63 patients with a biopsy-proven HNC were treated
   with HT. In patients with locoregional failure, the volume of failure
   (Vf) was contoured and co-registered with the initial planning computed
   tomography scan. With the use of dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis,
   the Vf was classified as ``in-field{''} (InF), ``marginal{''} (MF) or
   ``outside-field{''} (OutF), if >= 95\%, 20-94\%, and < 20\% of Vf,
   respectively, were within the 95\% isodose.
   Results: Median follow-up time was 25 months (95\% confidence interval
   19.4-28 months). 2-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and
   locoregional control were 66\%, 54\%, and 77\%, respectively. 13
   patients developed a locoregional failure (four local, eight regional,
   and one local and regional). After DVH analysis, there were ten InF and
   two ME recurrences as well as one OutF recurrence.
   Conclusion: Target delineation and coverage were adequate. The majority
   of locoregionalfailures were InF, i.e., in the high-dose region. Future
   work on dose escalation to the highest risk regions is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Objective(s)
   Rapid tests for detection of Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B
   Streptococci (GIBS) at the onset of labor are needed to permit early
   intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. This study aimed to evaluate the PCR
   assays targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rDNA) for detection of
   the GBS in comparison with a specific culture method.
   Materials and Methods
   Two swabs were used to obtain vaginal specimens from the 330 pregnant
   women attended delivery room at Hedayat hospital, Tehran, Iran. One swab
   was analyzed by direct plating onto selective GBS agar medium (ISLAM)
   and the other swab was used for a PCR assay, which amplified the 16S
   rDNA of S. agalactiae. Comparative study between the selective culture
   and the PCR assay was done among the 330 tested women.
   Results
   The GBS colonization rate based on the culture results was 20.6\%
   (68/330). Both culture and PCR methods were positive for 56 and negative
   for 253 women. The culture method was positive and PCR was negative in
   12 women. The culture was negative and the PCR positive for 9 women.
   Sensitivity of the PCR assay was 82.3\% and specificity was 96.5\%. The
   positive predictive value was 86.15\% and negative predictive value was
   95.4\%.
   Conclusion
   ISLAM diagnostic procedure and PCR are rapid and reliable analyzing
   methods, which might be useful for accurate diagnosis of GBS
   colonization in pregnant women at the time of delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Simulating semi-solid metal forming requires modelling semi-solid
   behaviour. However, such modelling is difficult because semi-solid
   behavior is thixotropic and depends on the liquid-solid spatial
   distribution within the material. In order to better understand and
   model relationships between microstructure and behavior, a model based
   on micromechanical approaches and homogenisation techniques is
   presented. This model is an extension of a previous model established in
   a pure viscoplastic framework to account for elasticity. Indeed,
   experimental load-displacement signals reveal the presence of an
   elastic-type response in the earlier stages of deformation when
   semi-solids are loaded under rapid compression. This elastic feature of
   the behaviour is attributed to the response of the porous solid skeleton
   saturated by incompressible liquid. A good quantitative agreement is
   found between the elastic-viscoplastic predicted response and the
   experimental data. More precisely, the strong initial rising part of the
   load-displacement curve, the peak load and the subsequent fall in load
   are well captured. The effect of solid fraction on mechanical response
   is in qualitative agreement with experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a degradation-based model to jointly determine the
   optimal burn-in, inspection, and maintenance decisions, based on
   degradation analysis and an integrated quality and reliability cost
   model. Degradation modeling plays an important role in reliability
   prediction and analysis for many highly reliable components and
   equipment, when the failures can rarely be observed. Unlike traditional
   applications, quality and reliability must be considered simultaneously
   for devices subject to degradation, because quality inspection decisions
   often impact anticipated reliability and failure-time distributions.
   This paper presents an integrated model to jointly optimize quality and
   reliability for devices subject to degradation, with a focus on burn-in,
   quality inspection, and maintenance policies. Based on the degradation
   modeling and analysis, the reliability function and the time-to-failure
   distribution are derived under the condition that the quality inspection
   is applied following the burn-in period. The optimal burn-in, quality
   inspection, and preventive maintenance policies are determined by
   minimizing the expected total cost per usage lifetime. The proposed
   model is illustrated using the application of light display devices, in
   which the degradation path follows a negative shifted lognormal
   distribution with a random failure threshold. A numerical example is
   provided to illustrate the application of our model to the light display
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Progranulin (GRN) gene variability has been analyzed in a sample of 354
   patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) compared with 343 controls. No
   significant differences were observed, but by stratifying according to
   MS subtypes, a significant increased frequency of the rs2879096 TT
   genotype was found in primary progressive MS (PPMS) patients versus
   controls (16.0 vs 3.5\%, P = 0.023, odds ratio (OR) 5.2, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 1.2-21.4). In addition, in PPMS, an association with the C
   allele of rs4792938 was observed (55.3 vs 33.5\%, P = 0.011, OR 2.4,
   95\% CI 1.2-4.7). An independent population was studied as replication,
   failing to confirm results previously obtained. Stratifying according to
   gender, an association with rs4792938 C allele was found in male PPMS
   patients compared with controls (40.7 vs 26.9\%, P = 0.002, OR 1.87,
   95\% CI 1.2-2.8). An association with the rs2879096T allele was observed
   (29.2 in patients compared with 18.9\% in controls, P = 0.012, OR 1.77,
   95\% CI 1.1-2.8). Haplotype analysis showed that TC haplotype frequency
   is increased in PPMS male patients compared with male controls (25.7 vs
   16.6\%; P = 0.02, OR 1.69, 95\% CI 1.1-2.7), whereas the respective GC
   haplotype seems to exert a protective effect, as its frequency is
   decreased in patients compared with controls (55.8\% vs 70.9\%; P =
   0.001, OR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.4-0.8). Therefore, GRN haplotypes likely
   influence the risk of developing PPMS in males. Genes and Immunity

Abstract = {{The standard FAO methodology for the determination of crop water
   requirements uses the product of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and
   crop coefficient values. This methodology can be also applied to
   soil-grown plastic greenhouse crops, which occupy extended areas in the
   Mediterranean basin, but there are few data assessing methodologies for
   estimating ETo in plastic greenhouses. Free-drainage lysimeters were
   used between 1993 and 2004 to measure ETo inside a plastic greenhouse
   with a perennial grass in Almeria, south-eastern Spain. Mean daily
   measured greenhouse ETo ranged from values slightly less than 1 mm
   day(-1) during winter to values of approximately 4 mm day(-1) during
   summer in July. When the greenhouse surface was whitened from March to
   September (a common practice to control temperature), measured ETo was
   reduced by an average of 21.4\%. Different methodologies to calculate
   ETo were checked against the measurements in the greenhouse without and
   with whitening. The methods that performed best in terms of accuracy and
   statistics were: FAO56 Penman-Monteith with a fixed aerodynamic
   resistance of 150 s m(-1), FAO24 Pan Evaporation with a constant Kp of
   0.79, a locally-calibrated radiation method and Hargreaves. Given the
   data requirements of the different methods, the Hargreaves and the
   radiation methods are recommended for the calculation of greenhouse ETo
   because of their simplicity.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical study was carried out on the presence of antioxidant
   constituents and the in vitro antioxidant capacity in the extracts of
   three species of Spanish red-skinned cactus pear fruits (Opuntia
   ficus-indica, Opuntia undulata and Opuntia stricta). The cactus pear
   fruit extracts were analyzed for determined constituents: ascorbic acid,
   flavonoids (quercetin, isorhamnetin, myricetin, kaempferol and
   luteolin), betalains, taurine, total carotenoids and total phenolics.
   The antioxidant capacity was assessed by means of two different methods:
   the 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Trolox
   equivalent antioxidant capacity) method and the
   2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical method. Opuntia ficus-indica fruit
   extract had the strongest antioxidant capacity and taurine content. O.
   stricta fruits were the richest in ascorbic acid and total phenolics,
   whereas O. undulata fruits showed the highest carotenoid content.
   Quercetin and isorhamnetin were the main flavonoids detected. This study
   provides basic information on the presence of bioactive compounds and
   antioxidant capacity in extracts of cactus pear fruits, in order to
   consider these extracts as ingredient for the production of
   health-promoting food.}},

   Comparison with cell proliferation and GABAergic system markers}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{The calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR) has been widely used as a
   marker of neuronal differentiation. In the present study we analyzed the
   distribution of CR-immunoreactive (CR-ir) elements in the embryonic and
   postembryonic retina of two elasmobranchs, the lesser spotted dogfish
   (Scyliorhinus canicula) and the brown shyshark (Haploblepharus fuscus).
   We compared the distribution of CR with that of a proliferation marker
   (the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA) in order to investigate
   the time course of CR expression during retinogenesis and explored the
   relationship between CR and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the
   synthesizing enzyme of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which has
   been reported to play a role in shark retinogenesis. The earliest CR
   immunoreactivity was concurrently observed in subsets of: a) ganglion
   cells in the ganglion cell layer; b) displaced ganglion cells in the
   inner plexiform layer and inner part of the inner nuclear layer (INLi);
   c) amacrine cells in the INLi, and d) horizontal cells. This pattern of
   CR distribution is established in the developing retina from early stage
   32, long after the appearance of a layered retinal organization in the
   inner retina, and coinciding with photoreceptor maturation in the outer
   retina. We also demonstrated that CR is expressed in postmitotic cells
   long after they have exited the cell cycle and in a subset of GABAergic
   horizontal cells. Overall our results provide insights into the
   differentiation patterns in the elasmobranch retina and supply further
   comparative data on the development of CR distribution in the retina of
   vertebrates. This study may help in understanding the possible
   involvement of CR in aspects of retinal morphogenesis. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We treated two patients with asymptomatic high grade internal carotid
   artery stenosis, by carotid artery stenting (CAS) with embolus
   protection filters 75\% and 70\%, respectively (North American
   Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy criteria). The immediate cranial and
   carotid angiogram showed a good result with regular patency of carotid
   and cerebral vessels. In both cases, the CAS procedure was complicated
   with symptomatic embolism, in one case 6 h after CAS and the other one
   occuring after seven days. The duplex scan (DS) control revealed the
   presence of plaque protrusion intra-stent in both cases. An early
   treatment with stent removal and carotid surgery was performed <24 h
   after the presenting symptoms (in one case a standard endarterectomy in
   the other and a carotid bypass was performed). Both patients were
   discharged without neurological deficit. At neurological follow-up at 30
   days the patients were in good general condition without neurological
   symptoms or deficit and the DS follow-up at 30 days and six to 12 months
   show the patency of carotid vessels. These two cases demonstrate that
   plaque protrusion is a possible complication of CAS, where symptoms
   which may occur either immediately or later and can be managed
   successfully with urgent surgical intervention of carotid stent removal.

Abstract = {{We report an eye-tracking study in which we investigate the on-line
   processing of written irony. Specifically, participants' eye movements
   were recorded while they read sentences which were either intended
   ironically, or non-ironically, and subsequent text which contained
   pronominal reference to the ironic (or non-ironic) phrase. Results
   showed longer reading times for ironic comments compared to a non-ironic
   baseline, suggesting that additional processing was required in ironic
   compared to non-ironic conditions. Reading times for subsequent
   pronominal reference indicated that for ironic materials, both the
   ironic and literal interpretations of the text were equally accessible
   during on-line language comprehension. This finding is most in-line with
   predictions of the graded salience hypothesis, which, in conjunction
   with the retention hypothesis, states that readers represent both the
   literal and ironic interpretation of an ironic utterance. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This paper explores whether the decisions made by a negotiator during
   negotiations are consistent with her preferences. By considering the
   entire set of offers exchanged during a negotiation, the measures of
   consistency developed in this paper provide a compact representation of
   important behavioral characteristics throughout the negotiation process.
   The consistency measures developed in this paper are validated with data
   from an experimental study in which the impact of two factors on
   negotiation processes is studied: the availability of analytical support
   and imposed vs. elicited preferences. We find that negotiators behave
   more consistently when preferences are assigned to them by the
   experimenters than when their preferences are elicited. On the other
   hand, an impact of analytical support is only found when preferences are
   elicited. These results shed light on both the design of negotiation
   experiments and the development of negotiation support systems.}},

   Inclusion of the field error produced by port holes in the close-fitting

   probe and radial displacement and distortion of power deposition from RF
   antenna heating. In this work, an analytic solution for the magnetic
   field error produced by a port hole is added to the equilibrium. Without
   inclusion, the beam trajectory can deviate by over a centimeter (on the
   order of the detector width) at the analyzer apertures. In addition, the

Abstract = {{In clostridia, n-butanol production from carbohydrates at yields of up
   to 76\% of the theoretical maximum and at titers of up to 13 g/L has
   been reported. However, in Escherichia coli, several groups have
   reported butyric acid or butanol production from recombinant expression
   of clostridial genes, at much lower titers and yields. To pinpoint
   deficient steps in the recombinant pathway, we developed an analytical
   procedure for the determination of intracellular pools of key pathway
   intermediates and applied the technique to the analysis of three sets of
   E. coli strains expressing various combinations of butyrate biosynthesis
   genes. Low expression levels of the hbd-encoded S-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
   dehydrogenase were insufficient to convert acetyl-CoA to
   3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, indicating that hbd was a rate-limiting step in
   the production of butyryl-CoA. Increasing hbd expression alleviated this
   bottleneck, but in resulting strains, our pool size measurements and
   thermodynamic analysis showed that the reaction step catalyzed by the
   bcd-encoded butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase was rate-limiting. E. coli strains
   expressing both hbd and ptb-buk produced crotonic acid as a byproduct,
   but this byproduct was not observed with expression of related genes
   from non-clostridial organisms. Our thermodynamic interpretation of pool
   size measurements is applicable to the analysis of other metabolic
   pathways.}},

   food being an important part of the treatment of the disease. Those

Abstract = {{Our understanding of RNA functions in the cell is evolving rapidly. As
   for proteins, the detailed three-dimensional (3D) structure of RNA is
   often key to understanding its function. Although crystallography and
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can determine the atomic coordinates of
   some RNA structures, many 3D structures present technical challenges
   that make these methods difficult to apply. The great flexibility of
   RNA, its charged backbone, dearth of specific surface features, and
   propensity for kinetic traps all conspire with its long folding time, to
   challenge in silico methods for physics-based folding. On the other
   hand, base-pairing interactions (either in runs to form helices or
   isolated tertiary contacts) and motifs are often available from
   relatively low-cost experiments or informatics analyses. We present
   RNABuilder, a novel code that uses internal coordinate mechanics to
   satisfy user-specified base pairing and steric forces under chemical
   constraints. The code recapitulates the topology and characteristic
   L-shape of tRNA and obtains an accurate noncrystallographic structure of
   the Tetrahymena ribozyme P4/P6 domain. The algorithm scales nearly
   linearly with molecule size, opening the door to the modeling of
   significantly larger structures.}},

Abstract = {{Food quality is directly linked to the food's appearance, texture and
   flavor. All three components must be in harmony for the food to be
   considered delicious. Understanding how various textures can be designed
   requires a comprehensive approach of evaluating food structure, oral
   processing and sensory evaluation. Oral processing considers the
   physiological processes in first bite, mastication and swallowing.
   Sensory stimuli during oral processing are used to determine the
   acceptance of texture. Recent research has focused on how milk proteins
   can be used to create desirable textures. Whey protein-polysaccharide
   mixtures were used to show how microstructure can be manipulated to
   produce a range of textures and control water release. The importance of
   microstructure in determining a variety of texture terms was
   demonstrated in whey protein emulsion gels. Finally, fat content in
   Cheddar cheese was shown to be critical to producing a desirable
   breakdown pattern. These and other applications will be discussed. (c)

Abstract = {{The stability and control of systems possessing passivity violations is
   considered. The authors seek to exploit the finite gain characteristics
   of a plant over a range in which a passive mapping no longer exists
   while implementing a similar hybrid passive and finite gain controller.
   Using the dissipative systems framework the authors define a hybrid
   system: one which possesses a passive map, and finite gain
   characteristics when the passive map is destroyed. The definition of a
   hybrid system utilises a switching parameter to break the system into
   passive and finite gain regions. It is shown that this switching
   parameter is equivalent to an ideal low-pass filter and can be
   approximated by a Butterworth filter. The stability of two hybrid
   systems within a negative feedback interconnection is also considered. A
   hybrid passivity and finite gain stability theorem is developed using
   both Lyapunov and input-output techniques, which yield equivalent
   results. Sufficient conditions for the closed-loop system to be stable
   are presented, which resemble an amalgamation of the traditional
   passivity and small-gain theorems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is growing support for the emotion context
   insensitivity hypothesis, which states that major depressive disorder
   (MDD) is associated with a deficit in emotional reactivity. Under this
   hypothesis, depressed individuals exhibit reduced behavioral and
   physiological responses to both appetitive and aversive stimuli. We
   sought to examine this possibility using the late positive potential, a
   neural response sensitive to aversive and threatening stimuli. Methods:
   Forty-seven individuals participated in the study, 22 of whom met
   criteria for current MDD and 25 with no history of depression or other
   Axis I disorders. All individuals passively viewed emotional faces while
   event-related potentials were recorded. Results: The vertex positive
   potential was significantly increased in response to fearful and angry
   faces across the entire sample. The late positive potential was also
   increased in response to threatening faces, but only among
   never-depressed individuals. In the MDD group, this electrocortical
   response to emotional faces was absent. Conclusions: This study provides
   neural evidence in support of the view that MDD is associated with
   blunted emotional reactivity to negative stimuli, which until now has
   been examined primarily with measures of behavior, self-report, and
   peripheral physiology. These results are also consistent with two prior
   studies showing reduced amygdala activation in response to fearful faces
   among depressed individuals. It remains to be determined whether
   abnormal activity in response to emotional stimuli is associated with
   trait risk for MDD or results from MDD. Depression and Anxiety

Abstract = {{Assessment of circulating CD4 count change over time in HIV-infected
   subjects on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a central component of
   disease monitoring. The increasing number of HIV-infected subjects
   starting therapy and the limited capacity to support CD4 count testing
   within resource-limited settings have fueled interest in identifying
   correlates of CD4 count change such as total lymphocyte count, among
   others. The application of modeling techniques will be essential to this
   endeavor due to the typically nonlinear CD4 trajectory over time and the
   multiple input variables necessary for capturing CD4 variability. We
   propose a prediction-based classification approach that involves first
   stage modeling and subsequent classification based on clinically
   meaningful thresholds. This approach draws on existing analytical
   methods described in the receiver operating characteristic curve
   literature while presenting an extension for handling a continuous
   outcome. Application of this method to an independent test sample
   results in greater than 98\% positive predictive value for CD4 count
   change. The prediction algorithm is derived based on a cohort of n = 270
   HIV-1 infected individuals from the Royal Free Hospital, London who were
   followed for up to three years from initiation of ART. A test sample
   comprised of n = 72 individuals from Philadelphia and followed for a
   similar length of time is used for validation. Results suggest that this
   approach may be a useful tool for prioritizing limited laboratory
   resources for CD4 testing after subjects start antiretroviral therapy.}},

   febrile UTI during a 5-year period were evaluated. The ability of acute
   DMSA scintigraphy to reveal dilating (grades 3-5) or severe (grades 4-5)
   VUR was assessed by comparing DMSA scan findings with those of voiding
   cystourethrography.
   RESULTS: Of the 296 children included, 46 had dilating and 25 severe
   VUR. Abnormal DMSA scan results were associated with an odds ratio of
   4.36 for dilating and 5.50 for severe VUR. For detecting dilating VUR,
   the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.68, the positive likelihood ratio
   (LR) was 2.00, and the negative LR was 0.46; for severe VUR, those
   values were 0.69, 2.10, and 0.38, respectively. Children with abnormal
   DMSA scan results combined with abnormal ultrasonography had an odds
   ratio of 3.60 for dilating and 6.32 for severe VUR. Despite normal
   findings on both investigations, 12 children had dilating and 4 severe
   VUR. For dilating VUR, the area under the (AUC) was 0.65, the positive
   LR was 1.70, and the negative LR was 0.47; for severe VUR, the values
   were 0.69, 1.90, and 0.29, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that acute DMSA scintigraphy has limited
   overall ability in identifying VUR and should not be endorsed as
   replacement for voiding cystourethrography in the evaluation of young
   children with a first febrile UTI. Pediatrics 2010;126:e513-e519}},

Abstract = {{We present a large-scale approach to investigate the functional
   consequences of sequence variation in a protein. The approach entails
   the display of hundreds of thousands of protein variants, moderate
   selection for activity and high-throughput DNA sequencing to quantify
   the performance of each variant. Using this strategy, we tracked the
   performance of > 600,000 variants of a human WW domain after three and
   six rounds of selection by phage display for binding to its peptide
   ligand. Binding properties of these variants defined a high-resolution
   map of mutational preference across the WW domain; each position had
   unique features that could not be captured by a few representative
   mutations. Our approach could be applied to many in vitro or in vivo
   protein assays, providing a general means for understanding how protein
   function relates to sequence.}},

Abstract = {{With the economic and social changes in Europe at the end of the
   sixteenth century and the formation and consolidation of an urban
   network throughout the continent, questions such as poverty, sanitation,
   and hygiene began to pose acute problems in the cities of the age. A new
   school of thought, known in Spain as Ciencia de Policia and in the
   Mediterranean area as Policy Science, proposed solutions for these
   problems and tested them through practical interventions inside the
   urban setting. In this article the author compares the work of two
   thinkers: Cristobal Perez de Herrera, a Spaniard, and Nicolas Delamare,
   a Frenchman. Writing in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
   centuries, Perez de Herrera examined the organization of Madrid, the
   newly founded (though still not firmly established) capital of Spain.
   Delamare based his study on the Paris of the early eighteenth century.
   The author stresses the coincidences in some of the ideas of both
   thinkers and shows how their writings begin to embody a new idea of the
   city, many aspects of which have survived until the present day.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregation of human therapeutic antibodies represents a significant
   hurdle to product development. In a test across multiple antibodies, it
   was observed that IgG1 antibodies aggregated less, on average, than IgG2
   antibodies under physiological pH and mildly elevated temperature. This
   phenomenon was also observed for IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses of
   anti-streptavidin, which shared 95\% sequence identity but varied in
   interchain disulfide connectivity. To investigate the structural and
   covalent changes associated with greater aggregation in IgG2 subclasses,
   soluble aggregates from the two forms of anti-streptavidin were isolated
   and characterized. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation
   (SV-AUC) measurements confirmed that the aggregates were present in
   solution, and revealed that the IgG1 aggregate was composed of a
   predominant species, whereas the IgG2 aggregate was heterogeneous.
   Tertiary structural changes accompanied antibody aggregation as
   evidenced by greater ANS (8-Anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid) binding
   to the aggregates over monomer, and differences in disulfide character
   and tryptophan environments between monomer, oligomer and aggregate
   species, as observed by near-UV circular dichroism (CD). Differences
   between subclasses were observed in the secondary structural changes
   that accompanied aggregation, particularly in the intermolecular
   beta-sheet and turn structures between the monomer and aggregate
   species. Free thiol determination showed similar to 2.4-fold lower
   quantity of free cysteines in the IgG1 subclass, consistent with the
   2.4-fold reduction in aggregation of the IgG1 form when compared with
   IgG2 under these conditions. These observations suggested an important
   role for disulfide bond formation, as well as secondary and tertiary
   structural transitions, during antibody aggregation. Such degradations
   may be minimized using appropriate formulation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{History and admission findings: A 53-year-old woman presented with
   recurrent episodes of cough and non-specific pulmonary symptoms. For
   many years she had been known to have primary biliary cirrhosis.
   Investigations: The chest X-ray showed multiple pulmonary nodules.
   Microbiological examination did not detect any pathogen and
   transbronchial biopsy of the pulmonary nodules failed to provide a
   diagnosis. Histology of a surgical lung biopsy showed interstitial
   inflammation, vasculitis and non-caseating granulomas.
   Treatment and course: The findings indicated necrotizing sarcoid
   granulomatosis. During oral corticoid therapy the pulmonary nodules
   regressed within a few weeks. The patient has remained free of pulmonary
   symptoms.
   Conclusion: Pulmonary necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis is a rare
   condition to consider in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary
   nodules. Because of the histological findings and its benign course it
   resembles sarcoidosis.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies of kinship in mammalian societies have been able to consider
   the complex interactions between home range overlap, association
   patterns and kinship, which have created a critical gap in our
   understanding of social evolution. We investigated the association
   patterns of female bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in the eastern
   gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia and found that they depended upon
   the complex interplay of at least three factors: home range overlap,
   matrilineal kinship and biparental kinship. While home range overlap was
   positively correlated with female association patterns, preferred
   associations were found between females showing as little as 27\% home
   range overlap, and some pairs showed avoidance despite 100\% home range
   overlap. Furthermore, on average, both casual and preferred associations
   took place between females that were more closely biparentally related
   than expected by chance and this pattern varied depending upon whether
   or not pairs of females shared the same matriline. (C) 2010 The

   situations demand of physicians. Objective: The authors attempt to
   identify and close gaps in the biopsychosocial model that hinder its
   application in certain real-life clinical situations. Method: The
   authors review some of the current and historical literature on the
   development and application of the biopsychosocial model, and argue the
   shortcomings of this modality in various clinical situations. Results:
   The authors present three dicta to guide clinicians toward relevant
   areas of inquiry: 1) Think neuroanatomically; 2) Think existentially;
   and 3) Think ``dirty;{''} that is, understand that patients and
   physicians sometimes work toward different goals. Discussion: These
   dicta form an addendum to the biopsychosocial model, identifying and
   filling three specific, commonly-encountered gaps in that paradigm,
   which, ironically, is usually considered all-inclusive. (Psychosomatics

   significant decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit, despite modern

   deleterious effects on patients, including delayed rehabilitation,
   exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions, higher complication rates,
   and increased pain. The ability to limit the amount of postoperative
   bleeding may reduce the amount of postoperative pain that patients

Title = {{Interpretation and intent: A study of the (mis)understanding of DNAR
   orders in a teaching hospital}},
Journal = {{RESUSCITATION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR) orders have been shown to be subject
   to misinterpretation in the 1980s and 1990s. We investigated whether
   this was still the case, and examined what perceptions doctors and
   nurses had of what care patients with DNAR orders receive.
   Methods: Using an anonymous written questionnaire, we directly
   approached 50 doctors and 40 nurses from a range of medical specialities
   and grades in our teaching hospital.
   Results: All 50 physicians and 35/40 nurses took part. Using McNemar's
   test, there were highly significant differences (p < 0.0001) in what
   doctors believed `should' take place and what they perceived `in
   practice' occurred on patients with DNAR orders in all areas questioned
   (e.g., frequency of nursing observations and contacting medical staff in
   the event of a patient's deterioration). Using Fisher's exact test,
   there were significant differences between what nursing staff thought
   occurred and what doctors thought should occur, for example, frequency
   of nursing observations (p < 0.001), contacting the medical team (p =
   0.01) and giving fluids (p < 0.005).
   Conclusions: Despite widespread use of DNAR orders, they are still
   misunderstood. This article highlights the frequency with which DNAR
   orders are interpreted to mean that other care should be withheld. In
   addition, it shows that although some doctors know that this should not
   be the case, they believe that DNAR orders affect the care that their
   patients receive. We propose that options for more detailed care plans
   should be embedded within the resuscitation decision and documentation
   to improve communication and understanding. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Polyethoxylated 2-perfluoroalkylethanols ('fluorotelomer ethoxylates',
   F-(CF2-CF2-)(x)-(CH2-CH2-O)(y)-H, FTEO) are an important class of
   non-ionic fluorinated surfactants, which have been disregarded as
   potential source of per- and polyfluorinated organic pollutants despite
   their high production and application amounts.
   A commercial mixture of FTEO with a perfluoroalkyl chain length between
   6 and 10 carbon atoms and an ethoxymer distribution between 0 and 13 was
   subjected to a biodegradation test. Monitoring of the aerobic
   biotransformation process by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS showed that FIE are rapidly
   transformed with a half-life of approximately 1 d.
   Structural elucidation of the biotransformation products with the help
   of hybrid quadrupole - linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry revealed
   oxidation to the respective carboxylic acid followed by sequential
   shortening of ethoxylate units which led to FTEO carboxylates (FTEOC).
   The conversion rate of FTEOC was found to diminish with decreasing
   number of ethoxylate units and virtually ceased for compounds with seven
   intact ethoxy units. These short-chain FTEOC were not further degraded
   within 48 d.
   Nonetheless, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and perfluorooctanoic acid
   (PFOA) were detected, whose formation is ascribed to degradation of
   residual fluorotelomer alcohols present in the commercial product.
   This article represents the first of two parts of a series concerning
   FTEO. Whilst this part is clearly focused on results of a biodegradation
   study of FTEO, part two will pinpoint analytical aspects, synthesis of
   biotransformation products and first evidence of environmental presence
   of the biotransformation products. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Motivation: In nature, protein-protein interactions are constantly
   evolving under various selective pressures. Nonetheless, it is expected
   that crucial interactions are maintained through compensatory mutations
   between interacting proteins. Thus, many studies have used evolutionary
   sequence data to extract such occurrences of correlated mutation.
   However, this research is confounded by other evolutionary pressures
   that contribute to sequence covariance, such as common ancestry.
   Results: Here, we focus exclusively on the compensatory mutations
   deriving from physical protein interactions, by performing large-scale
   computational mutagenesis experiments for >260 protein-protein
   interfaces. We investigate the potential for co-adaptability present in
   protein pairs that are always found together in nature (obligate) and
   those that are occasionally in complex (transient). By modeling each
   complex both in bound and unbound forms, we find that naturally
   transient complexes possess greater relative capacity for correlated
   mutation than obligate complexes, even when differences in interface
   size are taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies repeated games with imperfect public monitoring where

   We introduce the concept of perfect public ex post equilibrium (PPXE),
   and show that it can be characterized with an extension of the
   techniques used to study perfect public equilibria. We develop
   identifiability conditions that are sufficient for a folk theorem; these
   conditions imply that there are PPXE in which the payoffs are
   approximately the same as if the monitoring structure and payoff
   functions were known. Finally, we define perfect type-contingently
   public ex post equilibria (PTXE), which allows players to condition
   their actions on their initial private information, and we provide its
   linear programming characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The knowledge of the mechanical response of bones and their
   substitutes is pertinent to numerous medical problems. Understanding the
   effects of mechanical influence on the body is the first step toward
   developing innovative treatment and rehabilitation concepts for
   orthopedic disorders.
   Methods: This was a comparative study of 5 synthetic scaffolds based on
   porous calcium phosphates and natural bones, with regard to their
   microstructural, chemical, and mechanical characterizations. The
   structural and chemical characterizations of the scaffolds were examined
   by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray
   spectroscopy analysis. The mechanical characterization of bones and bone
   graft biomaterials was carried out through compression tests using
   samples with noncomplex geometry.
   Results: Analysis of the chemical composition, surface features,
   porosity, and compressive strength indicates that hydroxyapatite-based
   materials and trabecular bone have similar properties.}},

Abstract = {{Macrophages are heterogeneous and include classically activated M1 and
   alternatively activated M2 macrophages, characterized by pro- and
   anti-inflammatory functions, respectively. Macrophages that express heme
   oxygenase-1. also exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. We assessed the
   anti-inflammatory effects of statin in experimental anti-glomerular
   basement membrane glomerulonephritis and in vitro, focusing on the
   macrophage heterogeneity. Rats were induced anti-glomerular basement
   membrane glomerulonephritis and treated with atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day)
   or vehicle (control). Control rats showed infiltration of macrophages in
   the glomeruli at day 3 and developed crescentic glomerulonephritis by
   day 7, together with increased mRNA levels of the M1
   macrophage-associated cytokines, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis
   factor-a, and interleukin-12. In contrast, stain reduced the level of
   proteinuria, reduced infiltration of macrophages in glomeruli with
   suppression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression, and inhibited
   the formation of necrotizing and crescentic lesions. The number of
   glomerular ED3-positive macrophages decreased with down-regulation of M1
   macrophage-associated cytokines. Furthermore, statin augmented
   ED2-positive M2 macrophages with up-regulation of the M2
   macrophage-associated chemokines and cytokines, chemokine (C-C motif)
   ligand-17 and interleukin-10. Statin also increased the glomerular
   interleukin-10-expressing heme oxygenase-1-positive macrophages. Statin
   inhibited macrophage development, and suppressed ED3-positive
   macrophages, but augmented ED2-positive macrophages in M2-associated
   cytokine environment in vitro. We conclude that the anti-inflammatory
   effects of statin in glomerulonephritis are mediated through inhibition
   of macrophage infiltration as well as augmentation of anti-inflammatory
   macrophages. (Am J Pathol 2010, 177:1143-1154; DOI:

Abstract = {{An interval node in the upper limb termed the mid-arm node was recently
   identified. However, its surgical anatomy remains unclear. We report a
   patient with metastatic melanoma of the mid-arm node and the
   epitrochlear node at 10 years after removal of the primary tumour from
   the forearm and therapeutic axillary lymph node dissection. The mid-arm
   node is located halfway up the upper arm on the medial intermuscular
   septum, at the site where the brachial vessels, the median nerve and the
   ulnar nerve run adjacent to each other. The mid-arm node lies adjacent
   to the basilic vein where lymphatic vessels ascend and converge. This is
   the first report regarding the surgical anatomy of the mid-arm node. (C)

Abstract = {{N-{[}6-{[}2-{[}(5-Bromo-2-pyrimidinyl)oxy]ethoxy]-5-(4-methylphenyl)-4-p
   yrimidinyl]-4-(2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylethyl) benzenesulfonamide sodium
   salt (TA-0201) carboxylic acid form (TA-0201CA) is the primary and
   pharmacologically active metabolite of TA-0201, which is an orally
   active nonpeptide antagonist for endothelin receptors. A major
   elimination route of TA-0201CA in rats was biliary excretion. The aim of
   this study was to clarify the transporters responsible for the
   hepatobiliary transport of TA-0201CA by in vivo pharmacokinetic study
   and in vitro study using sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes (SCRH) from
   normal rats {[}Sprague-Dawley rats (SDR)] and Eisai hyperbilirubinemic
   rats (EHBR). After intravenous administration, TA-0201CA was extensively
   excreted into bile with a high biliary clearance in SDR. In contrast,
   the biliary clearance in EHBR was lower than that in SDR. These results
   indicated that multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) was
   partly involved in the biliary excretion of TA-0201CA. In SCRH, the
   hepatic uptake of TA-0201CA was significantly decreased by the presence
   of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp) substrates/inhibitors
   and a Na+-free condition, which is a driving force of the
   Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp). The canalicular
   secretion of TA-0201CA was inhibited by the bile salt export pump (Bsep)
   inhibitor glibenclamide and by the Mrp2 inhibitor
   3-{[}{[}3-{[}2-(7-chloroquinolin-2-yl)vinyl]phenyl]-(2-dimethylcar-bamoy
   lethylsulfanyl) methylsulfanyl] propionic acid (MK-571) in SCRH from SDR
   and EHBR. These results suggested that TA-0201CA was transported into
   hepatocytes via Oatps and Ntcp and excreted into bile via Mrp2 and Bsep
   in rats.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have suggested that maximum tumor diameter (MTD) is a
   predictor of PSA recurrence or biochemical recurrence (BCR) in prostate
   cancer after radical prostatectomy (RP). The significance of MTD in BCR
   prediction was evaluated using RP specimens of 364 patients with a BCR
   of 18\% (n=66) during a mean follow-up of 37.4 months (range: 10-109
   months). MTD was defined as the largest diameter of the largest tumor,
   and its median MTD was 15mm (range: 0.9-50 mm). MTD was significantly
   associated with pre-operative PSA levels, pathological T stage,
   Gleason's score and positive surgical margin. In a univariate analysis,
   pathological T stage, Gleason's score, positive surgical margin and MTD
   were associated significantly with the risk of BCR. Patients with >20mm
   MTD had a significantly higher risk of BCR than did those with <= 20mm
   MTD (P<0.001). Cox multivariate models indicated that pathological
   stage, Gleason's score, positive surgical margin and MTD were
   independent prognostic factors for BCR. MTD would be a useful tool for
   predicting BCR, as calculation of MTD is a simple and reliable measure.

Abstract = {{Modification by a halogen containing compound made the Pt/KL zeolite
   catalyst more active and selective than the original Pt/KL zeolite in
   the aromatization of C-6 and C-7 fractions in naphtha. Furthermore, the
   catalyst life of the halogen-modified Pt/KL (Pt/FKL) was much longer
   than that of Pt/KL due to less carbon formation rate. These features led
   Pt/FKL to industrial applications. TEM, H-2 adsorption, and NH3-TPD
   measurements revealed that the treatment of Pt/KL with halogen produces
   well dispersed Pt without changing the acidic property of the catalyst.
   The Pt/FKL catalyst has been commercialized as Aromax(A (R)) II
   catalyst; it was loaded into several Aromax(A (R)) process units in
