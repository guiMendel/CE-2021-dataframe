Abstract = {{Freeze-drying using a partial load is a common occurrence during the
   early manufacturing stages when insufficient amounts of active
   pharmaceutical ingredient (API) are available. In such cases, the
   immediate production needs are met by performing lyophilization with
   less than a full freeze dryer load. However, it is not obvious at what
   fractional load significant deviations from full load behavior begin.
   The objective of this research was to systematically study the effects
   of variation in product load on freeze drying behavior in laboratory,
   pilot and clinical scale freeze-dryers. Experiments were conducted with
   5\% mannitol (high heat and mass flux) and 5\% sucrose (low heat and
   mass flux) at different product loads (100\%, 50\%, 10\%, and 2\%).
   Product temperature was measured in edge as well as center vials with
   thermocouples. Specific surface area (SSA) was measured by BET gas
   adsorption analysis and residual moisture was measured by Karl Fischer.
   In the lab scale freeze-dryer, the molar flux of inert gas was
   determined by direct flow measurement using a flowmeter and the molar
   flux of water vapor was determined by manometric temperature measurement
   (MTM) and tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS)
   techniques. Comparative pressure measurement (capacitance manometer vs.
   Pirani) was used to determine primary drying time. For both 5\% mannitol
   and 5\% sucrose, primary drying time decreases and product temperature
   increases as the load on the shelves decreases. No systematic variation
   was observed in residual moisture and vapor composition as load
   decreased. Further, SSA data suggests that there are no significant
   freezing differences under different load conditions. Independent of
   dryer scale, among all the effects, variation in radiation heat transfer
   from the chamber walls to the product seems to be the dominant effect
   resulting in shorter primary drying time as the load on the shelf
   decreases (i.e., the fraction of edge vials increases). (C) 2010

Abstract = {{An electron-donor-acceptor type co-polymer. PDTTBBO, composed of
   3,5-dihexyldithieno{[}3,2-b:2'3'-d] dithiophene as donor and
   2,6-dimethyl benzo{[}1,2-d; 5,4-d'] bisoxazole as an acceptor unit was
   synthesized by Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) olefination reaction via
   multi-step procedure. The UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence
   emission peaks of the co-polymer in chlorobenzene were observed in a
   range from UV to near 700 nm. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
   (LUMO) and highest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the
   co-polymer were estimated at -5.71 eV and -3.46 eV, respectively,
   corresponding to a band-gap of 2.25 eV. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic
   cells were fabricated using a blend of PDTTBBO and PCBM with a ratio of
   1:1. The short-circuit current density (J(sc)), open-circuit voltage
   (V-oc) and fill factor (FF) of the device were estimated to be 1.306
   mA/cm(2), 0.628 and 0.37, respectively, corresponding to power
   conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.31\% under AM 1.5 illumination. (C)

Abstract = {{The nuclease activities of the malabaricones have been studied so as to
   establish a structure-activity correlation and deduce the mechanistic
   pathway of the process. The inactivity of malabaricone A and
   malabaricone D revealed that the resorcinol moiety, present in the
   malabaricones did not contribute to the nuclease activity. Amongst the
   test compounds, malabaricone C (mal C) containing a B-ring catechol
   moiety showed significantly better Cu(II)-dependent nuclease activity
   than the partially methylated catechol derivative, mal B and curcumin.
   Mal C was found to bind efficiently with Cu(II) and DNA to facilitate
   the DNA nicking via a site-specifically generated Cu(I)-peroxo complex.
   Consistent with its Cu(II)-dependent nuclease property, mal C showed
   better cytotoxicity (IC50 = 5.26 +/- 1.20 mu M) than curcumin (IC50 =
   24.46 +/- 3.32 mu M) against the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line.
   The mal C-induced killing of the MCF-7 cells followed an apoptotic
   pathway involving oxidative damage to the cellular DNA. (C) 2010

Title = {{THE SIN OF ABORTION AND ITS ANTHROPOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS ON THE DESTINY

Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Our contemporary society tends to be a worldlier rather than a spiritual
   one and pays less and less respect to the righteous human values that
   are supported and promoted by the anthropological Word of wisdom given
   by the Church of Jesus Christ. It promotes an autonomous human being and
   rejects God from His own creation by placing Him almost completely out
   of its life. The abortion - the murder of unborn children or termination
   of pregnancy - is the sin that has spread so much and has become so
   frequent that it may be called a real massacre of innocent children, a
   violent attack on the meaning of life. Preventing the birth of a child
   is a true calendar of death according to which the maternity of the
   ``modern{''} and ``emancipated{''} woman has turned out into a cynical
   child murder. People of our times who represent the contemporary lay
   world without God are totally disordered from a spiritual perspective
   and therefore cannot understand that, since the very moment of
   conception, life in the uterus equals to the individual human life, and
   what we call ``fetal existence{''} is recognized by God as a fully
   personal life. The newly created human being reflects the ``image{''} of
   God and it becomes the ``sacred reflection{''} that defines the personal
   identity of any human being. According to the Word of Church abortion is
   a first degree murder as the right to live is taken from a human being
   that is completely innocent. It can be named genocide because by killing
   a conceived life one also destroys the lives of possible successors and
   it may as well be called deicide as the child is taken away the right to
   share the Holy Spirit during the Sacrament of Baptism, and the blood of
   Jesus Christ is wasted together with the child's blood, which is the
   reflection of the Holy Image. We are created by the Almighty because of
   His conceiving love, and therefore, we have no right to intervene on any
   conceived human being, no matter its stage of development. Be it just an
   embryo, it has life, it is alive, and we have no right to refuse the
   gift God sends us. It carries the divine image and it is called to the
   eternal life in the name of God. Therefore, the abortion means murder,
   and it is a sin against God, who is the source of life and entire
   existence, it is a sin against the human nature and its never-ending
   destiny, it is a sin against the institution of family and society which
   are less vigorous because of fewer and fewer newborns. There is the
   Lord's Commandment ``You shall not kill!{''} (Exodus 20: 13) and we
   should blame this modern sin and fight against this ``plague{''} of our
   contemporary society We should take urgent measures against the practice
   of abortion, and even more against its legalization and we should be
   highly aware that the willing termination of a pregnancy and murder of
   an unborn child is the sin that destroys the very essence of humankind.}},

Abstract = {{A Total Joint Replacement Registry was developed in a large
   community-based practice to track implant utilization, monitor revisions
   and complications, identify patients during recalls and advisories, and
   provide feedback on clinical practices.
   We describe the development, implementation, and integration of this
   Total Joint Replacement Registry, highlighting critical steps in
   aligning information technology and operations.
   The primary Total Joint Replacement Registry data source consists of
   standardized electronic health record forms developed by consensus. The
   Total Joint Replacement Registry forms are integrated into the clinical
   workflow (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative) and produce a
   standardized progress note for electronic health record documentation.
   Secondary data are extracted from other electronic data sources using
   standard terminologies (ie, ICD-9 codes) to supplement the Total Joint
   Replacement Registry forms. Electronic screening algorithms are applied
   to identify complications, in combination with chart review validation
   and quality control mechanisms.
   Three hundred fifty surgeons voluntarily contribute to the registry with
   90\% participation. The registry has been used for implant recalls and
   advisories, contract decision making, and identification of patients at
   risk for revisions (eg, younger patients having total knee
   arthroplasty). Tracking of overall survival of implants influenced
   clinical practice, with feedback resulting in the reduction of the
   number of unicompartmental and uncemented knee arthroplasties performed,
   usage of femoral head sizes < 28 mm, and the number of minimally
   invasive surgical procedures performed.
   The Total Joint Replacement Registry has effectively aligned operations
   with information technology and leveraged that to enhance our ability to
   respond to recalls and advisories as well as improve quality of care,
   cost-effectiveness, and create research opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Plasma proteins {[}vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
   soluble VEGF receptor 2 (sVEGFR-2), carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), tissue
   inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), and Ras p21] and one tumor
   gene (VHL) were analyzed to identify prognostic biomarkers or indicators
   of response to sorafenib in a subset of patients enrolled in the
   Treatment Approaches in Renal Cancer Global Evaluation Trial.
   Experimental Design: Nine hundred three patients with advanced renal
   cell carcinoma (RCC) were randomized to 400 mg sorafenib twice a day or
   placebo. Samples collected at baseline and after 3 and 12 weeks were
   subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. VHL exons were
   sequenced from tumor biopsies.
   Results: Baseline biomarker data were available for VEGF (n = 712),
   sVEGFR-2 (n = 713), CAIX (n = 128), TIMP-1 (n = 123), Ras p21 (n = 125),
   and VHL mutational status (n = 134). Higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology
   Group performance status (ECOG PS) score correlated with elevated
   baseline VEGF (P < 0.0001) and a higher incidence of VHL mutations (P =
   0.008), whereas higher Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)
   score correlated with elevated VEGF (P < 0.0001), CAIX (P = 0.027), and
   TIMP-1 (P = 0.0001). Univariable analyses of baseline levels in the
   placebo cohort identified VEGF (P = 0.0024), CAIX (P = 0.034), TIMP-1 (P
   = 0.001), and Ras p21 (P = 0.016) as prognostic biomarkers for survival.
   TIMP-1 remained prognostic for survival in a multivariable analysis
   model (P = 0.002) that also included ECOG PS, MSKCC score, and the other
   biomarkers assayed. In the placebo cohort, TIMP-1 (P < 0.001) and Ras
   p21 (P = 0.048) levels increased at 12 weeks. In the sorafenib cohort,
   VEGF levels increased at 3 and 12 weeks of treatment (both weeks P <
   0.0001), whereas sVEGFR-2 (both weeks P < 0.0001) and TIMP-1 levels (P =
   0.002, week 3; P = 0.006, week 12) decreased.
   Conclusions: VEGF, CAIX, TIMP-1, and Ras p21 levels were prognostic for
   survival in RCC patients. Of these, TIMP-1 has emerged as being
   independently prognostic. Clin Cancer Res; 16(19); 4853-63. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{P>Along with sperm quality parameters, the protein profile of European
   eel seminal plasma was analyzed during induced spermiation (n = 56
   samples). Motility, Percentage of live cells, spermatozoa head
   morphometry and concentration showed low values during the initial weeks
   of spermiation and maintained high levels throughout the rest of the
   experiment. The protein profile gradient by SDS-PAGE (4-15\%) registered
   four important electrophoretic bands around 80, 40, 26 and 12 KDa. Three
   of them showed significant differences in concentration during treatment
   (80, 40 and 12 KDa), and all of them showed the highest value on the 8th
   week. Both 80 and 12 KDa bands increased until the 8th week, followed by
   a progressive decline. One possible explanation for these profiles is
   that, in the first weeks of treatment, proteins originated from blood
   plasma are accumulated in the seminal plasma, and from the 8th week some
   of these proteins are incorporated into the spermatic membranes. The 40
   KDa protein band also increased during the first 8 weeks, but maintained
   high concentrations in the seminal plasma for the rest of the
   experiment. One result confirms the theory that the presence of proteins
   in the seminal plasma having a molecular weight lower than 50 KDa
   increased spermatozoa motility, since the 40 KDa band displayed
   significantly higher values coinciding with the high percentages of
   spermatozoa motility. Seminal plasma proteins seem to have an important
   role in spermatogenesis and spermatozoa movement, but further studies
   are necessary to discover the identity of these proteins and their
   precise functions.}},

Abstract = {{By converting an optimal control problem for nonlinear systems to a
   Hamiltonian system, a symplecitc-preserving method is proposed. The
   state and costate variables are approximated by the Lagrange polynomial.
   The state variables at two ends of the time interval are taken as
   independent variables. Based on the dual variable principle, nonlinear
   optimal control problems are replaced with nonlinear equations.
   Furthermore, in the implementation of the symplectic algorithm, based on
   the 2 (N) algorithm, a multilevel method is proposed. When the time grid
   is refined from low level to high level, the initial state and costate
   variables of the nonlinear equations can be obtained from the Lagrange
   interpolation at the low level grid to improve efficiency. Numerical
   simulations show the precision and the efficiency of the proposed
   algorithm in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In pregnant sheep at 120-128 clays of gestational age, a study was done
   to evaluate the effect of the co-administration of verapamil (Vpm) and
   ivermectin (IVM) on the maternal and fetal disposition kinetics after
   intravenous administration of IVM. Ten pregnant Suffolk Down sheep of
   63.5 +/- 6.6 kg body weight (bw) were surgically prepared to insert
   polyvinyl catheters in the fetal femoral artery and vein and amniotic
   sac. The ewes were randomly assigned to two experimental groups. In
   Group 1 (control), 5 ewes were treated with an intravenous bolus of 0.2
   mg IVM/kg bw. In Group 2 (Vpm-IVM), 5 ewes were subcutaneously treated
   with Vpm (2.5 mg/kg x 3 doses at 12 h intervals) and 0.2 mg/kg IVM by
   intravenous route. Maternal and fetal blood samples were taken before
   and after IVM administration during a 144h post-treatment period.
   Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography (HPLC). A
   non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed and statistical
   differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test.
   Significantly higher IVM levels in maternal plasma concentrations were
   determined after co-administration of Vpm/IVM compared with the group
   treated with IVM alone. Significant decreases in the volume of
   distribution and in the half-life of elimination (t(1/2) (beta)) were
   observed in the Vpm/IVM treated group. A significantly faster (T-max)
   and higher (C-max) (P < 0.05) increase in IVM fetal plasma
   concentrations were observed in the group of fetuses from pregnant ewes
   treated with Vpm/IVM. The results of our study support the hypothesis
   that pharmacological blockage of P-glycoprotein with Vpm can increase
   the transfer of IVM to fetal circulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   progeny (BC!) carried the Inn] gene and were resistant to imazamox, and
   to analyze the parentage of F-1 and BC1 plants. The average seed set of

   plants had jointed goatgrass as the maternal parent; whereas, most BC1
   plants (85.7\%) were produced with IR winter wheat as the paternal
   backcross parent. Although the backcrossing of F-1 hybrids with jointed

Abstract = {{Introduction: Neurobiological research has implicated the cerebellum as
   one possible site of neurophysiological dysfunction in ADHD. Latest
   theoretical conceptualizations of the cerebellum as core site of the
   brain to model motor as well as cognitive behavior puts further weight
   to the assumption that it might play a key role in ADHD pathophysiology.
   Methods: 30 medication free adult ADHD patients and 30 group matched
   (gender, age and education) healthy controls were investigated using the
   method of chemical shift imaging (CSI) of the cerebellum. The vermis,
   left and right cerebellar hemispheres were processed separately.
   Results: We found significantly increased glutamate-glutamine (Glx) to
   creatine (Cre) ratios in the left cerebellar hemisphere. No other
   differences in measured metabolite concentrations were observed.
   Discussion: To our knowledge this is the first evidence for
   neurochemical alterations in cerebellar neurochemistry in adult ADHD.
   They relate well to recent hypotheses that the cerebellum might control
   mental activities by internal models. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Though commonly used in social science research to measure the influence
   of social networks, the link between discussing ``important matters{''}
   within networks and the achievement of instrumental ends is frequently
   unspecified or untested. To address this gap, we explore the
   consequences of using the general ``important matters{''} approach
   versus one in which the substance of discussions is directly linked to
   the outcomes of interest. The egocentric social networks of people
   experiencing an acute health crisis are examined. We identify the
   characteristics of and the degree of membership overlap between
   ``important matters{''} and ``health matters{''} discussants, and
   explore their relative power in explaining a wide range of health and
   health services-related outcomes. We find no evidence for the influence
   of ``important matters{''} networks, while characteristics of ``health
   matters{''} networks demonstrate a significant effect across all models.

Abstract = {{Tumor-associated macrophages can potentially kill tumor cells via the
   high concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible nitric
   oxide synthase (iNOS); however, tumor-associated macrophages actually
   support tumor growth, as they are skewed toward M2 activation, which is
   characterized by low amounts of NO production and is proangiogenic. We
   show that the mouse renal cell carcinoma cell line, RENCA, which, on
   stimulation, expresses high levels of iNOS mRNA, loses its ability to
   express the iNOS protein. This effect is mediated by the microRNA
   miR-146a, as inhibition of RENCA cells with anti-miR-146a restores iNOS
   expression and NO production (4.8 +/- 0.4 versus 0.3 +/- 0.1 mu mol/L in
   uninhibited cells, P < 0.001). In vivo, RENCA tumor cells do not stain
   for iNOS, while Infiltrating tumor-associated macrophages showed intense
   staining, and both cell types expressed iNOS mRNA. Restoring iNOS
   protein expression in RENCA cells using anti-miR-146a increases
   macrophage-induced death of RENCA cells by 73\% (P < 0.01) in vitro and
   prevents tumor growth in vivo. These results suggest that, in addition
   to NO production by macrophages, tumor cells must produce NO to induce
   their own deaths, and some tumor cells may use miR-146a to reduce or
   abolish endogenous NO production to escape macrophage-mediated cell
   death. Thus, inhibiting miR-146a may render these tumor cells
   susceptible to therapeutic strategies, such as adoptive transfer of
   M1-activated macrophages. (Am J Pathol 2010, 177:2046-2054; DOI:

Abstract = {{Biofuels can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by replacing fossil
   fuels. However, the energy yield from agronomic crops varies due to
   local climate, weather and soil variability. A variation in the yield of
   raw material used (feedstock) could also cause variability in GHG
   reductions if biofuels are used. The goal of the present study was to
   determine the net reduction of GHG emissions if ethanol from wheat
   produced in different regions of the south-eastern USA is used as an
   alternative to gasoline from fossil fuel sources. Two scenarios were
   investigated; the first included ethanol produced from grain only, and
   the second included ethanol produced from both grain and wheat straw.
   Winter wheat yield was simulated with the Cropping System Model
   (CSM)-CERES-Wheat model for climate, soil and crop management
   representing six counties in the following USA states : Alabama, Florida
   and Georgia. Ethanol production was determined from the simulated grain
   and straw yields together with fixed grain and straw yield ethanol
   ratios. Subsequently, net reductions in GHG emissions were determined by
   accounting for the emissions from the replaced gasoline, and by animal
   feed and electricity that were replaced by ethanol processing
   co-products. Greenhouse gases that were emitted in the ethanol
   production chain were also taken into account. Across all locations, the
   reduction in GHG emissions was 187 g CO2-equivalents/km in the
   grain-only scenario and 208 g CO2-equivalents/km in the grain and straw
   scenario. The reductions in GHG emissions varied significantly between
   locations and growing seasons within the two scenarios. Similar
   approaches could be applied to assess the environmental impact of GHG
   emissions from other biofuels.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala is a fascinating complex structure that lies at the center
   of much of our current thinking about emotion Here I will review data
   that suggest that the amygdala is involved in several processes linked
   to determining what a stimulus is and what the organism should therefore
   do - the two questions that are part of the title This piece will focus
   on three main aspects of amygdala function namely attention value
   representation and decision making by reviewing both non-human and human
   data Two mechanisms of affective attention will be described The first
   involves projections from the central nucleus of the amygdala to the
   basal forebrain which has extensive and diffuse projections throughout
   the cortical mantle The second Involves projections from the basal
   amygdala to multiple levels across the visual cortex I will also
   describe how the basolateral amygdala is important for the
   representation of value and in decision making Overall it will be argued
   that the amygdala plays a key role in solving the following problem How
   can a limited-capacity information processing system that receives a
   constant stream of diverse inputs be designed to selectively process
   those inputs that are most significant to the objectives of the system?
   What is it? and What s to be done? processes can then be viewed as
   important building blocks in the construction of emotion a process that
   is intertwined with cognition Furthermore answering the two questions
   directs how resources should be mobilized as the organism seeks out

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general stochastic model developed for a class of
   cooperative wireless relay networks, in which imperfect knowledge of the
   channel state information at the destination node is assumed. The
   framework incorporates multiple relay nodes operating under general
   known nonlinear processing functions. When a nonlinear relay function is
   considered, the likelihood function is generally intractable resulting
   in the maximum likelihood and the maximum a posteriori detectors not
   admitting closed form solutions. We illustrate our methodology to
   overcome this intractability under the example of a popular optimal
   nonlinear relay function choice and demonstrate how our algorithms are
   capable of solving the previously intractable detection problem.
   Overcoming this intractability involves development of specialized
   Bayesian models. We develop three novel algorithms to perform detection
   for this Bayesian model, these include a Markov chain Monte Carlo
   approximate Bayesian computation (MCMC-ABC) approach; an auxiliary
   variable MCMC (MCMC-AV) approach; and a suboptimal exhaustive search
   zero forcing (SES-ZF) approach. Finally, numerical examples comparing
   the symbol error rate (SER) performance versus signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) of the three detection algorithms are studied in simulated
   examples.}},

Abstract = {{Arabidopsis ATSIP2 has recently been suggested to be a raffinose
   synthase gene. However, it has high amino acid identity to functionally

   mays. Using the Sf9 insect cell expression system, we demonstrate that
   recombinant ATSIP2 is a genuine alkaline alpha-galactosidase with a
   distinct substrate specificity for raffinose, and not a raffinose
   synthase. A beta-glucuronidase reporter construct using the ATSIP2
   promoter shows that ATSIP2 is strongly expressed in sink tissues of
   Arabidopsis, i.e. sink leaves and non-xylem parts of the root stele,
   suggesting a physiological function in raffinose phloem unloading.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effects of electrical stimulation (ES),
   stretching and their combined effects in matrix metalloproteinases
   (MMPs) gene expression and activity during early denervation of rat
   tibialis anterior (TA) muscle by axonotmesis.
   Methods: Thirty adult male Wistar rats were divided into five groups:
   normal (N), denervated TA (D), denervated TA submitted to daily ES (D +
   ES), denervated TA submitted to daily stretching (D + St) and denervated
   TA submitted daily to both ES and stretching concurrently (D + ES + St).
   Both zimographic analysis and real time polymerase chain reaction of
   MMPs were used to muscular evaluation. In addition, muscle fiber
   cross-section area (CSA) was also evaluated.
   Results: Stretching increased MMP-2 activity in denervated muscle when
   performed alone as well as in association with ES (p<0.01). Both
   stretching and ES, individually and in association, increased MMP-2 gene
   expression in denervated muscle compared to N and D (p<0.05). All
   denervated groups decreased muscle fiber CSA compared to N (p<0.05).
   Discussion: While stretching is the main stimulus leading to the
   activation of MMP-2, both ES and stretching are able to increase MMP-2
   gene expression in rat denervated muscle suggesting ECM remodeling.}},

Title = {{ASSESSMENT OF MATURITY OF LOIRE VALLEY WINE GRAPES BY MID-INFRARED
   SPECTROSCOPY}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL DES SCIENCES DE LA VIGNE ET DU VIN}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim: The objective of the present study was to assess the ripening of
   grapes collected at different stages of maturation between the
   ``veraison{''} and harvest periods from mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS)
   analysis.
   Methods and results: Grape berries of Cabernet Franc collected in two
   locations of the Loire Valley region (Touraine and Anjou), from 28 vine
   plots and during two vintages (2005 and 2006) were analysed. With
   principal component analysis (PCA) of spectral data of grape musts,
   different levels of ripening were described during the three to four
   weeks before harvest. A separation according to origin (Touraine or
   Anjou) was also observed and confirmed by the results of partial least
   squares (PLS) discriminant analysis (88 \% of correct classification).
   Similar evolutions and geographical discriminations were obtained for
   specific physicochemical parameters. By PLS regression, good predictions
   of titratable acidity and sugar concentration from berry spectral data
   were obtained, with root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.53
   g/L for titratable acidity (expressed in H2SO4) and 8 g/L for sugar
   concentration. Moreover, when the data from only one of the regions were
   considered, the predictions of titratable acidity and sugar
   concentration were improved and those of real acidity (pH) and maturity
   index were then satisfactory. The RMSEP values for samples from Touraine
   and Anjou were reduced, respectively,to 0.05 and 0.02. units for pH, 0.4
   and 0.12 g/L for titratable acidity (expressed in H2SO4), 6.6 and 3.2
   g/L for sugar concentration, and 5 and 2.2 units for maturity index.
   Conclusion: Spectroscopic and classic chemical analyses of grape berries
   yielded highly similar results. The evolution of berries from
   ``veraison{''} to harvest can be characterized according to both time
   course and region. The samples showed similar PCA results for chemical
   and IR spectra parameters. PLS regression between chemical and spectral
   data showed that Fourier transform IR is a good method to predict
   acidity and sugar concentration throughout ripening. And the results for
   these parameters, as well as for pH, maturity index and anthocyanin
   concentration, are improved if the regressions are calculated from
   sample sets restricted to a single growing region. Consequently, a
   calibration model is required for each grape geographical origin.
   Significance and impact of the study: The potential of MIRS was
   demonstrated for the quantification of the main indicators of maturity
   during berry ripening. Furthermore, these spectra can be used to
   estimate grape maturity in particular in reference to a spectral
   database established over several years of study. The association
   infrared spectroscopy, chemometric methods and database will help to
   monitor ripening and to determine the optimum harvest date.}},

Abstract = {{An assemblage of primary, extremely As- and Sb-rich, Nb-Ta minerals from
   the Szklary pegmatite includes columbite-(Fe), columbite-(Mn),
   tantalite-(Mn), stibiocolumbite, stibiotantalite, an as yet unnamed
   (As,Sb,U)-rich (Ta,Ti)-oxide, Mn3UAs2Sb2Ta2Ti2O20, and holtite.
   Anomalous trends of Mn-Fe and Ta-Nb fractionation in the columbite group
   and crystallization sequences in the primary assemblage can be explained
   by the contamination of the pegmatite-forming melt by ultramafic and
   mafic wall-rocks, the competition among these minerals for Ta and Sb and
   with biotite and tourmaline for Mg, Fe, and Ti, and local variations in
   melt composition. A hot magmatic fluid, exsolved from the parental melt,
   reacted with the primary Nb-Ta oxides, inducing two different patterns
   of alteration. The columbite-group minerals were altered to fersmite,
   pyrochlore, and bismutopyrochlore locally grading to plumbopyrochlore,
   whereas stibiocolumbite, stibiotantalite, and the (As,Sb,U)-rich
   (Ta,Ti)-oxide altered to stibiomicrolite, uranmicrolite grading to
   betafite, and then to bismutomicrolite or Bi-dominant betafite. In all
   of the secondary pyrochlore-group minerals, Ta-Nb fractionation is
   comparable to, or only slightly greater, than that in the primary Nb-Ta
   oxides, indicating a modest differentiation of the residual melt
   coexisting with the fluid.}},

Abstract = {{Children with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) often do not present like
   adults with an ascending paralysis and sensory abnormalities, but
   typically have pain and gait difficulties as predominant symptoms. We
   present a case of paediatric GBS that was not diagnosed until late in
   the course because of limited neurological examination, erroneous
   interpretation of newly acquired data and insufficient familiarity with
   the disorder in children. Through this case, essentials of paediatric
   GBS are reviewed.
   Conclusion:
   pain and gait difficulties can be the main features of paediatric GBS at
   presentation. In addition, a comprehensive neurological exam in any case
   of weakness or diffuse pain combined with ongoing critical
   interpretation of a disease course allows for adjustment of a
   preliminary diagnosis towards a potentially life-threatening disease.}},

Abstract = {{We present and discuss density functional theory calculations addressing
   the electronic structure and energetics of isolated oxygen ad-atoms at
   the (001) surfaces of PbTiO3 (PTO) and LaMnO3 (LMO) cubic perovskites.
   Both AO- and BO2-type of surface terminations are considered for each
   perovskite. Difference electron density analysis has been carried out
   for each surface to probe local electronic charge redistribution upon
   oxygen adsorption. Our results show that the (001) surfaces of the two
   perovskites behave quite differently towards oxygen adsorption. In the
   case of the PTO (001) surfaces, the adsorbate oxygen atom was found to
   form a peroxide-type molecular species along with a surface lattice
   oxygen atom on both PbO- and TiO2-terminated surface facets. On the
   other hand, the most stable oxygen adsorption site for the LMO (001)
   surfaces corresponds to the one expected from a natural continuation of
   the perovskite lattice. Moreover, the dissociative adsorption of
   molecular oxygen varies from being only slightly exothermic on the PTO
   (001) facets to being highly exothermic on the LMO (001) facets. The
   AO-terminated facets, in general, showed a stronger binding to the
   adsorbed oxygen. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We aimed to assess through Raman spectroscopy and
   fluorescence the levels of calcium hydroxyapatite (CHA) and lipids and
   proteins in complete fractures treated with internal rigid fixation
   (IRF) treated or not with laser phototherapy (LPT) and associated or not
   with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and guided bone regeneration
   (GBR). Background: Fractures have different etiologies and treatments
   and may be associated with bone losses. LPT has been shown to improve
   bone healing. Methods: Tibial fractures were created on 15 animals and
   divided into five groups. LPT started immediately after surgery,
   repeated at 48-h intervals. Animal death occurred after 30 days.
   Results: Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence were performed at the
   surface. Fluorescence data of group IRF + LPT + Biomaterial showed
   similar readings to those of the group IRF-no bone loss. Significant
   differences were seen between groups IRF + LPT + Biomaterial and IRF +
   LPT; IRF + LPT + Biomaterial; and IRF + Biomaterial; and between IRF +
   LPT + Biomaterial and IRF. CH groups of lipids and proteins readings
   showed decreased levels of organic components in subjects treated with
   the association of LPT, biomaterial, and GBR. Pearson correlation showed
   that fluorescence readings of both CHA and CH groups of lipids and
   proteins correlated negatively with the Raman data. Conclusions: The use
   of both methods indicates that the use of the biomaterials associated
   with infrared LPT resulted in a more-advanced and higher quality of bone
   repair in fractures treated with miniplates and that the DIAGNOdent may
   be used to perform optical biopsy on bone.}},

Title = {{Robust solutions to Stackelberg games: Addressing bounded rationality
   and limited observations in human cognition}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{174}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{1142-1171}},

Abstract = {{How do we build algorithms for agent interactions with human
   adversaries? Stackelberg games are natural models for many important
   applications that involve human interaction, such as oligopolistic
   markets and security domains. In Stackelberg games, one player, the
   leader, commits to a strategy and the follower makes her decision with
   knowledge of the leader's commitment. Existing algorithms for
   Stackelberg games efficiently find optimal solutions (leader strategy),
   but they critically assume that the follower plays optimally.
   Unfortunately, in many applications, agents face human followers
   (adversaries) who - because of their bounded rationality and limited
   observation of the leader strategy - may deviate from their expected
   optimal response. In other words, human adversaries' decisions are
   biased due to their bounded rationality and limited observations. Not
   taking into account these likely deviations when dealing with human
   adversaries may cause an unacceptable degradation in the leader's
   reward, particularly in security applications where these algorithms
   have seen deployment. The objective of this paper therefore is to
   investigate how to build algorithms for agent interactions with human
   adversaries.
   To address this crucial problem, this paper introduces a new
   mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for Stackelberg games to consider
   human adversaries, incorporating: (i) novel anchoring theories on human
   perception of probability distributions and (ii) robustness approaches
   for MILPs to address human imprecision. Since this new approach
   considers human adversaries, traditional proofs of correctness or
   optimality are insufficient; instead, it is necessary to rely on
   empirical validation. To that end, this paper considers four settings
   based on real deployed security systems at Los Angeles International
   Airport (Pita et al., 2008 1351), and compares 6 different approaches
   (three based on our new approach and three previous approaches), in 4
   different observability conditions, involving 218 human subjects playing
   2960 games in total. The final conclusion is that a model which

Abstract = {{A certain number of autistic children seem to develop normally for the
   first 12 months of their lives to regress then or have their development
   stop, and manifest a pathology of autism near 18months. From the data
   present in the literature, and our clinical observation in this article
   we will attempt to demonstrate that it is possible to diagnose the
   autistic pathology within the aforementioned category of infants before
   the appearance of the obvious symptoms, that is to say during their 1st
   year as well as to propose a reflection on the aptitudes that fall into
   place during this period and which prepare the sequel of their
   development, and finally, to examine the possible role of the reaction
   to the novelty of the stimuli in the early diagnosis of this pathology.
   It has to be said that the clinical observation of autistic children,
   the testimony of their parents and of young high level autistic adults
   underline a recurrent symptom in this population, whatever their age or
   level of achievement: It is the difficulty or even the impossibility
   they experience when faced with new situations, demonstrated by a marked
   resistance to changes in their daily routine. These subjects appear to
   present an obsessive and anguished need to preserve a stable environment
   without the slightest transformation. It seems that they have an
   extremely intense reaction to the novelty of stimuli. Does this
   particularity exist in the infant who will become an autistic child,
   could parents identify this particularity, and could it constitute a
   sign for the early diagnosis of autism? Around 60\% of these children
   ``become{''} autistic after their first birthday. In some, the
   developmental curve shifts and the signs of autism appear gradually. In
   others, a phenomenon of regression is described at the same time as the
   emergence of behavioral problems. The fields where this regression is
   most obvious are language and social interaction. Our hypothesis is that
   the syndrome of autism does not suddenly appear at the age of eighteen
   months, but that its `emergence' is in the making during the infant's
   first months through a series of dysfunctional phenomena, that are
   unobtrusive and so go unnoticed by the parents. We have explored these
   phenomena, using the cognitive genesis habitually described in children
   with a typical development. We arrived at the conclusion that the subtle
   disorders relative to the perceptive-sensorial treatments have since the
   beginning gradually invaded the sphere of their relation to the
   surrounding world, perturbing their experience of closeness and bonding.
   Anomalies which lead to faults in the pattern of expected aptitudes,
   faults which undermine and weaken the foundations, leading to a movement
   of reversal during the second year and to the massive actualization of
   the signs of autism, which had previously been latent because the
   aptitudes, which should have been the base on which the subsequent ones
   stand, cannot develop due to the missing support of the previous ones,
   so that the evolutional dynamics are interrupted. Communicational and
   social behavioral disorders in autistic subjects might come, at least in
   part, from a major difficulty early on, in processing new aspects of
   their environment, which are often saturated with dynamic informations.
   Our study leads us to think that the abnormal reaction of patients with
   autism faced with the novelty of a situation constitutes one of the key
   deficits of autism and could be a sign for the diagnosis of this
   pathology in the first months of life. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Title = {{The prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) urine test in men with previous

   influence the performance of the PCA3 score in predicting positive
   biopsies?}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To determine the performance characteristics of the prostate cancer gene
   3 (PCA3) score on the outcome of biopsy relative to different ranges of
   free-to-total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ratio (f/tPSA) in men with
   a previous negative biopsy and a PSA level of 2.5-10 ng/mL, as urine
   tests like PCA3 are currently under investigation in order to improve
   prostate cancer diagnosis and to decrease the rate of unnecessary
   rebiopsies.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS
   Data from the previous prospective European multicentre study were
   reviewed. Only patients with a PSA level of 2.5-10 ng/mL were included
   in the present study. In all, 301 patients had complete data. The
   diagnostic accuracy of the PCA3 score for predicting a positive biopsy
   outcome was studied using sensitivity, specificity, negative and
   positive predictive values. The PCA3 performance was evaluated relative
   to three different subgroups of f/tPSA, as follows: > 20\% (group 1),
   10-20\% (group 2) and < 10\% (group 3).
   RESULTS
   The prostate cancer detection rates were 18.8\%, 23.9\% and 34.8\% in
   groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve of the PCA3 score, total PSA and f/tPSA was 0.688,
   0.553 and 0.571, respectively. The percentage of men with positive
   biopsies was 30.6\%, 37.0\% and 44.4\% in those with a PCA3 score of >
   30, vs 10.3\%, 15.5\% and 28.6\% when the PCA3 score was < 30, in groups
   1, 2 and 3, respectively. The difference was significant only in groups
   1 and 2. In men with a f/tPSA of < 10\% the difference in detection
   rates relative to the PCA3 score was not statistically significant
   regardless of which PCA3 threshold was used. A high PCA3 score was
   significantly associated with age, clinical T2 stage and positive biopsy
   (P < 0.001, 0.013 and < 0.001, respectively). In bivariate analysis
   accounting for the PCA3 score and the f/tPSA, a PCA3 score of > 30 was a
   significant independent predictor of positive biopsies (odds ratio 3.01;
   95\% confidence interval 1.74-5.23; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS
   PCA3 remained a better predictor of prostate cancer than f/tPSA. In men
   with a f/tPSA of > 10\%, the use of the PCA3 score was highly correlated
   with the risk of having cancer on re-biopsy, and could prevent
   unnecessary prostate biopsies if the value is low.}},

Abstract = {{Barium titanate (BT) and montmorillonite (MMT) nanoparticles were
   covalently-bonded by organically modifying the particle surfaces and
   chemically reacting them in solution. These integrated two-material
   hybrid inorganic nanofillers were subsequently dispersed in epoxy resin

   inorganic component consisted of well dispersed BT spherical
   nanoparticles that are surrounded by attached layered MMT nanoplatelets,
   with the latter having the ability to react with the epoxy matrix. The
   thermodynamic properties of the glass transition process, the
   macroscopic mechanical properties of the nanocomposites, and the
   dynamics of the polymer segments at the inorganic interfaces, all
   indicate that this filler configuration enhances the polymer-ceramic
   interfaces. Polarization as a function of electric field and dielectric
   breakdown show improvements in the electrical properties of these
   composites, compared to the corresponding unfilled epoxy, despite the
   expected reduction in crosslinking density. The resulting nanocomposites
   have a property set which can be utilized in energy storage and power
   system applications. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The structures of two crystal modifications of the W34F mutant
   ribonuclease from the bacterium Bacillus intermedius (binase) were
   solved and refined at 1.7 and 1.1 resolution. The kinetic parameters of
   the hydrolysis of substrates of different length (GpU, GpUp, and
   poly(I)) by binase and its W34F mutant were investigated and compared.
   The catalytic activity of the enzymes was shown to increase with
   increasing length of the substrate. The substitution of tryptophan for
   phenylalanine does not lead to a change in the activity of the enzyme
   but results in a decrease of the binding constants for substrates
   containing more than one phosphate groups. A comparison of the structure
   of the mutant enzyme with the previously established structures of
   binase and its complexes with sulfate ions and guanosine monophosphate
   showed that the difference in their kinetic parameters is related to the
   fact that the mutant ribonuclease cannot bind the second phosphate
   group. Both crystal modifications of the mutant binase contain dimers,
   like in the crystal structure of binase studied previously. In these
   dimers, only one enzyme molecule can bind the substrate molecule. Since
   the dimers were found in the crystals grown under four different
   conditions, it can be suggested that the enzyme can exist as dimers in
   solution as well. Mutants of binase, which could exclude the formation
   of dimers, are suggested.}},

Volume = {{222}},

Abstract = {{Rhabdomyosarcomas are soft tissue sarcomas of mesenchymal origin. Unlike
   rhabdomyosarcomas observed in paediatric patients which typically
   respond well to chemotherapeutic treatment, adults generally present
   with pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas that are typically associated with
   poor prognosis. Therefore, understanding the molecular biology that
   gives rise to pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas is critical. In this issue
   of The Journal of Pathology, Doyle and colleagues have generated elegant
   tissue-specific Cre/loxP-dependent mouse models that mimic pleomorphic
   rhabdomyosarcoma development in humans. In this report, the authors
   employed KRas(G12V)-expressing mouse models that concomitantly either
   express mutant p53 ( p53R172H) or have deleted the p53 gene. Mice that
   express mutant p53 have decreased survival with development of
   aggressive metastases as compared to mice that have simply lost
   wild-type p53. The data presented herein provide the first in vivo
   evidence that in rhabdomyosarcomas, expression of mutant p53 results in
   a more aggressive p53R172H-dependent gain-of-function phenotype.

Abstract = {{The relevance of radical initiation methodologies for the classical
   hydrosilylation reactions of organic compounds bearing C-C multiple
   bonds is due to the need to come up with newer and more efficient
   methods to effect this reaction, on account of its applications on
   surface chemistry. In the past, when organic solvents were employed,
   thermal and photochemical methods for the chain initiation reaction have
   been documented (thermal and photochemical decompositions of azo
   compounds). We herein present the dioxygen-initiation technique of the
   classical radical hydrosilylation reaction of C-C triple bonds with
   tris(trimethylsilyl)silane ((Me(3)Si)(3)SiH) in water. This initiation
   technique is confronted with the photochemical radical initiation in the
   absence of a chemical radical precursor other than the silane and also
   confronted with the classical thermal initiation triggered by the
   decomposition of an azo compound, both performed in water. The
   radical-based dioxygen initiation methodology studied in water is shown
   to afford the highest Z:E stereoselective ratios of hydrosilylated
   alkenes. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   a strong secondary hardening at high strain range as a result of a

   to nucleate in austenitic grains containing a high density of
   dislocations but not at slip band intersections, as is usually reported
   for austenitic stainless steels. Considering the unstable composition of
   the steel studied and the decrease of the grain size, dislocations
   structures inside austenite grains are unchanged but cyclic solicitation
   promotes the induced transformation of austenitic phase. Localization of
   the martensite grains formed depends on the grain texture and the grain

   and metabolism in patients with acute ICH show similar abnormalities to
   those that occur in patients with traumatic brain injury, thus raising
   the question of whether there are common mechanisms of injury shared by
   the 2 conditions. In both ICH and traumatic brain injury, there is an
   early reduction in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen without
   ischemia, mitochondrial dysfunction, and transient focal increases in
   regional glucose metabolism that occur after a few days. ICH and
   traumatic brain injury share barotrauma from pressure waves that
   propagate through the intracranial contents as a common mechanism of
   brain injury. Recent data demonstrating contralateral hemispheric damage
   in patients with acute ICH provide further support for this theory of
   common injury mechanisms. (Stroke. 2010;41{[}suppl 1]:S107-S110.)}},

Abstract = {{Identifying integrable coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations
   (ODEs) of dissipative type and deducing their general solutions are some
   of the challenging tasks in nonlinear dynamics. In this paper we
   undertake these problems and unearth two classes of integrable coupled
   nonlinear ODEs of arbitrary order. To achieve these goals we introduce
   suitable nonlocal transformations in certain linear ODEs and generate
   the coupled nonlinear ODEs. In particular, we show that the problem of
   solving these classes of coupled nonlinear ODEs of any order effectively
   reduces to solving a single first order nonlinear ODE. We then describe
   a procedure to derive explicit general solutions for the identified
   integrable coupled ODEs, when the above mentioned first order nonlinear
   ODE reduces to a Bernoulli equation. The equations which we generate and
   solve include the two coupled versions of modified Emden equations (in
   second order), coupled versions of Chazy equations (in third order), and
   their variants, higher dimensional coupled Ricatti and Abel's chains, as
   well as a new integrable chain and higher order equations. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{``Controlled cyclophotocoagulation{''} is a real-time dosage control
   which reduces the complications of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation to
   a negligible amount in European eyes. Applied to a few African eyes,
   however, the method failed. Obviously, the physical parameters of the
   laser procedure need adjustment to African eyes.
   After theoretical investigations and tests in African cadaver eyes, 940
   nm laser wavelength instead of 810 nm and a different fiber coupling had
   solved the problem of physical differences between European and African
   eyes to a large extent. The method was then applied to 272 eyes of 188
   patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, of which it was possible to
   follow 26 eyes of 18 patients for at least 1 year. Median age of the
   patients was 63.7 years, with the youngest 16.8 years, the oldest 88.8
   years. Either 16 or 24 laser spots were applied at random. If both eyes
   were treated, they were treated in the same session.
   The average intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction after 1 year was 7.5
   mmHg, with average glaucoma drug reduction from 1.5 to 1.2 substances.
   At least one pop spot occurred in 32\% of the eyes. No statistically
   significant difference between 16 and 24 spots was found. No severe
   complications such as intraocular bleeding, hypotony < 7 mmHg, choroidal
   detachment or phthisis were observed.
   Controlled cyclophotocoagulation with the 940 nm laser is a safe method
   which can be applied as the first-choice treatment to African primary
   open-angle glaucoma eyes. Individual IOP prediction, however, is very
   difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Concurrent signal transduction inhibition with the
   epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib and the
   mammalian target-of-rapamycin inhibitor everolimus has been hypothesized
   to result in enhanced antitumor activity in patients with non-small cell
   lung cancer (NSCLC). This phase II trial assessed the efficacy of the
   combination of gefitinib and everolimus in patients with advanced NSCLC.
   Methods: Two cohorts of 31 patients with measurable stage IIIB/IV NSCLC
   were enrolled: (1) no prior chemotherapy and (2) previously treated with
   cisplatin or carboplatin and docetaxel or pemetrexed. All patients
   received daily everolimus 5 mg and gefitinib 250 mg. Response was
   assessed after 1 month and then every 2 months. Pretreatment tumor
   specimens were collected for mutation testing.
   Results: Sixty-two patients were enrolled (median age: 66 years, 50\%
   women, 98\% stage IV, all current/former smokers, and 85\%
   adenocarcinoma). Partial responses were seen in 8 of 62 patients
   (response rate: 13\%; 95\% confidence interval: 5-21\%); five responders
   had received no prior chemotherapy. Three partial responders had an EGFR
   mutation. Both patients with a KRAS (G12F) mutation responded. The
   median time to progression was 4 months. Median overall survival was 12
   months, 27 months for no prior chemotherapy patients, and 11 months for
   patients previously treated with chemotherapy.
   Conclusions: The 13\% partial response rate observed did not meet the
   prespecified response threshold to pursue further study of the
   combination of gefitinib and everolimus. The response rate in patients
   with non-EGFR mutant tumors was 8\%, likely reflecting activity of
   everolimus. Further investigation of mammalian target-of- rapamycin
   inhibitors in patients with NSCLC with KRAS G12F-mutated tumors is
   warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Drought during the pre-flowering stage can increase yield of peanut.
   There is limited information on genotypic variation for tolerance to and
   recovery from pre-flowering drought (PFD) and more importantly the
   physiological traits underlying genotypic variation. The objectives of
   this study were to determine the effects of moisture stress during the
   pre-flowering phase on pod yield and to understand some of the
   physiological responses underlying genotypic variation in response to
   and recovery from PFD. A glasshouse and field experiments were conducted
   at Khon Kaen University, Thailand. The glasshouse experiment was a
   randomized complete block design consisting of two watering regimes,
   i.e. fully-irrigated control and 1/3 available soil water from emergence
   to 40 days after emergence followed by adequate water supply, and 12
   peanut genotypes. The field experiment was a split-plot design with two
   watering regimes as main-plots, and 12 peanut genotypes as sub-plots.
   Measurements of N(2) fixation, leaf area (LA) were made in both
   experiments. In addition, root growth was measured in the glasshouse
   experiment. Imposition of PFD followed by recovery resulted in an
   average increase in yield of 24 \% (range from 10 \% to 57 \%) and 12 \%
   (range from 2 \% to 51 \%) in the field and glasshouse experiments,
   respectively. Significant genotypic variation for N(2) fixation, LA and
   root growth was also observed after recovery. The study revealed that
   recovery growth following release of PFD had a stronger influence on
   final yield than tolerance to water deficits during the PFD. A
   combination of N(2) fixation, LA and root growth accounted for a major
   portion of the genotypic variation in yield (r = 0.68-0.93) suggesting
   that these traits could be used as selection criteria for identifying
   genotypes with rapid recovery from PFD. A combined analysis of
   glasshouse and field experiments showed that LA and N(2) fixation during
   the recovery had low genotype x environment interaction indicating
   potential for using these traits for selecting genotypes in peanut
   improvement programs.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: There is limited knowledge on the relationship between
   lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and asthma and wheezing during
   infancy, as there are few studies with prospective design, birth cohort
   and in non selected population. The objectives of the present study were
   to determine the prevalence of asthma and recurrent wheezing in
   childhood and to analyse the relationship between LTRI during the first
   year of life and the development of asthma and/or wheezing in childhood.
   Patients and Methods: Prospective birth cohort study conducted in the
   Hospital del Mar (Barcelona). We recruited 487 children, followed up
   from the pregnancy to the 6th year of life. As outcomes we studied: the
   presence of asthma and wheezing. As independent variables we studied:
   LTRI occurring during the first year of life, and some covariables
   including, among others: prematurity, birth weight, maternal history of
   asthma and atopy, breastfeeding, prenatal exposure to tobacco.
   Results: The asthma prevalence at 6 year of age was 9.3\%. The variables
   associated with the development of asthma were LTRI, prematurity, atopic
   mother and formula breastfeeding. LTRI during the first year of life
   were also related with early recurrent wheezing and persistent wheezing.
   Conclusions: Our results confirm that LTRI during the first year of life
   are related to the diagnosis of asthma and with the clinical phenotypes
   of early wheezing and persistent wheezing. These results are in
   accordance with the concept that LTRI occurring during a critical period
   of development, as are the first years of life, have an important role
   on in the later development of asthma and recurrent wheezing. (C) 2010

Title = {{Evaluating the Modulation Transfer Function of Auditory Steady State
   Responses in the 65 Hz to 120 Hz Range}},
Journal = {{EAR AND HEARING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{667-678}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Auditory steady state response (ASSR) tests allow
   frequency-specific assessment of the auditory system. The responses can
   be elicited with long-duration tones that are modulated at particular
   rates. The literature has reported that some rates may evoke larger
   responses than others. Modulation transfer functions (MTFs), which show
   ASSR response as a function of modulation rate, can be created by
   presenting a fixed carrier with a modulation rate that is swept over
   time. Here, we explore the profiles of MTFs with particular effort made
   toward examining (1) the rates in the MTF that provided the maximum and
   minimum values, (2) the means and ranges of ASSRs within each MTF, and
   (3) MTF test-retest repeatability. Because recording ASSRs to a 500-Hz
   carrier frequency is often difficult at 60 dB SPL or less, we focused
   our efforts on this frequency. The main objective of this study was to
   evaluate the possibility of using MTFs for the purpose of identifying
   both optimal and unfavorable modulation rates.
   Design: Fifty-four normal hearing adult subjects were allocated to one
   of four experimental conditions. The first two conditions used a 500-Hz
   carrier and generated MTFs where modulation rate was varied continuously
   across a low (66 to 102 Hz) or high (86 to 121 Hz) range. In two
   additional conditions, a 500-Hz carrier having a modulation rate fixed
   at 82 Hz and a 2000-Hz carrier having a swept modulation rate (66- to
   102-Hz range) were also obtained for comparison. Stimuli were presented
   at 60 dB SPL. The two ranges of modulation were used because these have
   implications for the generators and characteristics of the evoked
   responses. Responses were analyzed for each condition using a Fourier
   analyzer. To assess the stability of the MTF, two recordings, of 25 mins
   each, were obtained for each subject.
   Results: MTF profiles and modulation rates associated with maximum and
   minimum amplitudes clearly demonstrated repeatability between the two
   recordings. More specifically, modulation rates for the maximum and
   minimum amplitudes showed correlations above 0.92 between the two
   recordings. Using combined data from the two replications, we found that
   differences between maximum and minimum amplitudes were between 34 and
   51 nV when modulation rate was varied. For the fixed modulation rate
   condition, the difference was only 22 nV, which was due to fluctuations
   in noise. Response amplitude and noise estimates obtained in this study
   suggest that similar to 30\% of individuals would require at least 10
   mins more recording time if an actual hearing test was performed using
   the modulation rate associated with the ASSR amplitude minimum rather
   than the maximum. For some individuals, the ASSR would not be detected
   in a practical amount of time if the wrong modulation rate were relied
   upon during a clinical test.
   Conclusions: In research applications requiring repeated measurements,
   or clinical contexts such as intraoperative monitoring or assessment of
   aided hearing, setting stimulus modulation rate parameters based on a
   previous analysis of an individual's MTF could be extremely beneficial.
   Sufficient time must be spent in recording the MTF to adequately
   attenuate the contribution of noise to the ASSR amplitude estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Fusarium head blight (FHB) is primarily caused by Fusarium graminearum
   in North America. Isolates of F graminearum can be identified as one of
   three chemotypes: 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3ADON),
   15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (I5ADON), and nivalenol (NIV). In this study,
   we characterized F graminearum isolates collected in 1980 to 2000 (old
   collection) and in 2008 (new collection) from North Dakota and found a
   I5-fold increase of 3ADON isolates in the new collection. Evaluation of
   randomly selected 3ADON isolates and 15ADON isolates on three spring
   wheat genotypes (Grandin. Steele-ND, and ND 2710) by single-floret
   inoculation indicated that the 3ADON population caused a higher disease
   severity and produced more DON at a significant level than the 15ADON
   population on Grandin (susceptible to FHB) and ND 2710 (with FHB
   resistance from Sumai 3). However, no significant differences in disease
   severity and DON production were observed between the two populations on
   Steele-ND (with moderate resistance from Triticum dicoccoides). The
   3ADON isolates also exhibited a higher DON production in rice culture
   and produced more spores on agar media than the 15ADON isolates,
   suggesting a fitness advantage of the newly emerging 3ADON population
   over the prevalent 15ADON population. Population genetic analyses using
   DNA markers revealed a significant genetic differentiation between the
   two populations. The information obtained in this study could have an
   impact on development of FHB-resistant wheat cultivars and disease
   management.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the properties of orbital period changes of four short
   period sdB-type eclipsing binaries, HW Vir, HS 0705 + 6700, HS 2231 +
   2441, and NSVS 14256825, we have monitored them photometrically since
   2006. Apart from HW Vir, it is found that the O-C diagrams of HS 0705 +
   6700 and HS 2231 + 2441 can also be described by a cyclic variation
   superimposed on a downward parabolic curve, indicating a long-term
   period decrease in the two systems. Therefore, of the four binary
   systems, long-term period variations have been detected for three ones
   that can be explained by magnetic braking of the fully convective
   component stars. This may drive these systems to evolution into normal
   cataclysmic variables. As for the cyclic period variations observed in
   the four systems, the light-travel time effect via the presence of a
   tertiary component is the most possible mechanism to interpret the
   periodic change, which reveals the presence of extremely low-mass
   objects (e.g., brown dwarf stars and huge planets) in this kind of
   binaries.}},

Abstract = {{The helix-loop-helix inhibitor of differentiation and DNA binding (Id1)
   is well known as an oncogene in various tumors. Although it has been
   reported that Id1 promotes several oncogenic processes, it is still
   unclear whether Id1 functions through epigenetic transcriptional
   regulation. In this study, we examined the effect of Id1 on polycomb
   group (PcG) proteins, which are crucial epigenetic gene silencers, and
   found that Id1 regulated the expression of Mel-18 and Bmi-1, both of
   which belong to polycomb repressive complex 1. We also confirmed that
   Id1 induced Mel-18 downregulation, which was mediated by the Akt
   pathway, and consequently upregulated the transcription of its target
   gene, c-Myc. Using a promoter-reporter, we demonstrated that Id1
   regulated Bmi-1 transcription through c-Myc binding to its E-box in the
   promoter. Finally, we examined the activity of E3 ligase RING1b, whose
   catalytic activity is increased by binding with the RING finger protein
   Bmi-1, and found that Id1 overexpression enhanced RING1b E3 ligase
   activity leading to accumulation of H2A ubiquitination and
   ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of geminin. Taken together,
   our study provided a novel link between Id1 and PcG proteins and
   suggested that Id1 may contribute to tumor development through
   PcG-mediated epigenetic regulation. Oncogene (2010) 29, 5818-5827; doi:

Abstract = {{Cr-modified silicide coatings were prepared on a Ti-Nb-Si based
   ultrahigh temperature alloy by Si-Cr co-deposition at 1250 degrees C,
   1350 degrees C and 1400 degrees C for 5-20 h respectively. It was found
   that both coating structure and phase constituents changed significantly
   with increase in the co-deposition temperature and holding time. The
   outer layers in all coatings prepared at 1250 degrees C for 5-20 h
   consisted of (Ti,X)(5)Si(3) (X represents Nb, Cr and Hf elements).
   (Ti,X)(5)Si(4) was found as the only phase constituent in the
   intermediate layers in both coatings prepared at 1250 degrees C for 5
   and 10 h, but the intermediate layers in the coatings prepared at 1250
   degrees C for 15 and 20 h were mainly composed of (Ti,X)(5)Si(3) phase
   that was derived from the decomposition of (Ti,X)(5)Si(4) phase. In the
   coating prepared at 1350 degrees C for 5 h, single (Ti X)(5)Si(3) phase
   was found in its outmost layer, the same as that in the outer layers in
   the coatings prepared at 1250 degrees C; but in the coatings prepared at
   1350 degrees C for 10-20 h, (Nb(1.95)Cr(1.05))Cr(2)Si(3) ternary phase
   was found in the outmost layers besides (Ti,X)(5)Si(3) phase. In the
   coatings prepared at 1400 degrees C for 5-20 h,
   (Nb(1.95)Cr(1.05))Cr(2)Si(3) ternary phase was the single phase
   constituent in their outmost layers. The phase transformation
   (Ti,X)(5)Si(4)->(Ti,X)(5)Si(3) + Si occurred in the intermediate layers
   of the coatings prepared at 1350 and 1400 degrees C with prolonging
   co-deposition time, similar to the situation in the coatings prepared at
   1250 degrees C for 15 and 20 h, but this transformation has been speeded
   up by increase in the co-deposition temperature. The transitional layers
   were mainly composed of (Ti,X)(5)Si(3) phase in all coatings. The
   influence of co-deposition temperature on the diffusion ability of Cr
   atoms was greater than that of Si atoms in the Si-Cr co-deposition
   processes investigated. The growth of coatings obeyed inverse
   logarithmic laws at all three co-deposition temperatures. The Si-Cr
   co-deposition coating prepared at 1350 degrees C for 10 h showed a good
   oxidation resistance due to the formation of SiO(2) and Nb, Cr-doped
   TiO(2) scale after oxidation at 1250 degrees C for 10 h. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Rice seed dormancy is an important trait related to the preharvest
   sprouting resistance of rice and is controlled by a polygene network. To
   identify the genes involved in this process, transcriptome analysis was
   applied to strong seed dormancy indica cultivar N22 and its weak
   dormancy mutant Q4646. The results showed that 280 genes were
   significantly upregulated and 244 genes significantly downregulated in
   the seed of Q4646 as compared to N22 during 25 to 28 days after heading.
   These genes were mainly involved in stress response, C-compound
   metabolism, plant development, DNA processing, and lipid metabolism.
   Some of these genes were colocalized with several reported dormancy
   QTLs, suggesting that they are possibly candidate genes underlying rice
   seed dormancy. Our work provides important clues for future effort to
   clone seed dormant genes in rice.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have suggested that leptin works as a key regulator in
   the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA), and genetic factors modulate
   OA. This study assessed the contribution of leptin gene (LEP)
   polymorphism(s) to knee OA among Han Chinese. Three tag
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering all those LEP SNPs of
   which the minor allele frequencies were over 10\% were selected. Study
   subjects (697 patients and 699 controls) were divided into four groups
   (underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese) by body mass index
   (BMI). Allele and genotype frequencies in the three tag SNPs were
   significantly different in the normal weight and overweight groups. In
   the normal weight, overweight and obese groups, BMI (P=4.3 x 10(-5),
   0.012 and 0.009, respectively) and gender (P=3.5 x 10(-22), 5.1 x
   10(-23) and 2.1 x 10(-8), respectively) were effective factors. Age was
   an independent effective factor in the overweight group (P 0.009).
   Haplotypes were associated with OA in the normal weight group (CAT,
   P=0.015) and the overweight group (AGC, P=0.015). Our results suggest an
   association between LEP and knee OA in the normal weight and overweight
   groups among Han Chinese. Journal of Human Genetics (2010) 55, 704-706;

   spiral arm clouds by CH absorption lines}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{521}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We have observed CH absorption lines (J = 3/2, N = 1 <- J = 1/2, N = 1)
   against the continuum source Sgr B2(M) using the Herschel/HIFI
   instrument. With the high spectral resolution and wide velocity coverage
   provided by HIFI, 31 CH absorption features with different radial
   velocities and line widths are detected and identified. The narrower
   line width and lower column density clouds show ``spiral arm{''} cloud
   characteristics, while the absorption component with the broadest line
   width and highest column density corresponds to the gas from the Sgr B2
   envelope. The observations show that each ``spiral arm{''} harbors
   multiple velocity components, indicating that the clouds are not uniform
   and that they have internal structure. This line-of-sight through almost
   the entire Galaxy offers unique possibilities to study the basic
   chemistry of simple molecules in diffuse clouds, as a variety of
   different cloud classes are sampled simultaneously. We find that the
   linear relationship between CH and H-2 column densities found at lower
   AV by UV observations does not continue into the range of higher visual
   extinction. There, the curve flattens, which probably means that CH is
   depleted in the denser cores of these clouds.}},

Abstract = {{Scholars and commentators alike have long used `organized medicine' as
   shorthand for the American Medical Association (AMA). However, organized
   medicine has increasingly shown signs of fragmentation into specialty
   societies over the last two decades. While the AMA remains the largest
   association of physicians, and wields a great deal of influence in
   political circles, its use as a proxy for organized medicine may warrant
   reevaluation due to the changing political organization of medicine. We
   developed a unique database of specialty medical society appearances
   before all Congressional committees by combining records from
   Lexis-Nexis Congressional and the Policy Agendas database. Descriptive
   statistics were used to evaluate the participation of specialty
   societies by committee and by hearing type. The Herfindahl-Hirschman
   Index (HHI) was used to measure whether specialty societies develop
   niche roles with specific committees, and the Chi-Square Goodness of Fit
   test was used to study the distribution of specialty society testimonies
   in health hearings more formally.
   We found that although the AMA participates in Congressional hearings at
   a higher rate than any other individual medical specialty society, it
   accounts for a decreasing percentage of all specialty society
   appearances over time. In addition, specialty societies have developed
   niche and monopoly roles in health policymaking as well as relationships
   with particular congressional committees over time. We conclude that the
   increasing participation of specialty medical societies in the
   policymaking process is important because medical societies do not
   testify solely to promote the economic self-interest of their members.
   Specialization in medicine has segmented lobbying roles, such that
   specialty societies have a different focus than the AMA. Thus,
   `organized medicine' and the AMA are no longer synonymous. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We assessed density, gut fullness and prey composition of round goby

   Round goby had been present at the area of original introduction since

   into the outermost reaches sampled in the study. Catch per unit angling
   effort in nearshore sites indicated that round goby density in the area
   of original introduction was more than double their density in the
   upstream expansion area and nearly three times the density in the
   downstream expansion area. Gut fullness index was lower in gobies from
   the area of original introduction than for those at the upstream and
   downstream edges of their expanded range. The most dramatic difference
   in diet composition was with dreissenids, where large gobies (a parts
   per thousand yen70 mm) occupying the area of original introduction had
   almost no dreissenid biomass in their guts, whereas dreissenids were the
   predominant prey type in gobies occupying the two expansion areas.
   Post-hoc zebra mussel density in the area of original introduction was
   an order of magnitude lower than in the two expansion areas which,
   combined with the differences in stomach fullness and prey composition,
   suggest that local, density-related reduction of this prey type was
   occurring in the river.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful tool for the
   analysis of various electrochemical systems because it allows the
   separation and characterization of individual kinetic processes. In this
   paper we investigate whether changes in the EIS characteristics can be
   used to distinguish between solid-state ISE membrane that have been
   subjected to physical damage, biofouling or leaching of active
   components. We conclude that with these relatively simple electronic
   measurements, we can effectively evaluate the functionality of the ISE
   membrane; i.e. we can predict whether the sensors are fully functional,
   in need for calibration or are completely non-functional. We believe
   this could form the basis of a simple but effective diagnostic tool for
   probing the condition of remotely deployed ISEs in widely distributed
   chemo-sensor networks (e.g. for environmental monitoring) and for
   enhancing the reliability of these devices. Our ultimate goal is to
   implement such tools in place of conventional approaches to ISE testing
   like calibration with standard solutions, which require the integration
   of complex and costly fluidics.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral Schwinger model with the Faddeevian anomaly is considered. It is
   found that imposing a chiral constraint this model can be expressed in
   terms of chiral boson. The model when expressed in terms of chiral boson
   remains anomalous and the Gauss law of which gives anomalous Poisson
   brackets between itself. In spite of that a systematic BRST quantization
   is possible. The Wess-Zumino term corresponding to this theory appears
   automatically during the process of quantization. A gauge invariant
   reformulation of this model is also constructed. Unlike the former one
   gauge invariance is done here without any extension of phase space. This
   gauge invariant version maps onto the vector Schwinger model. The gauge
   invariant version of the chiral Schwinger model for a=2 has a massive
   field with identical mass however gauge invariant version obtained here
   does not map on to that.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To assess the efficacy of vacuum therapy in mechanically straightening
   the penile curvature of Peyronie's disease (PD).
   PATIENTS AND METHODS
   Modelling of the tunica albuginea has been shown to be possible during
   penile implant surgery and this principle has been applied as an
   alternative conservative therapy. In all, 31 patients with PD (mean
   duration 9.9 months; mean age 51 years, range 24-71) completed the
   study. Over a 12-week period, the patients used a vacuum device (Osbon
   ErecAid (R), MediPlus, High Wycombe, UK) for 10 min twice daily. The
   assessment at study entry and at completion after 12 weeks included the
   International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire, a perceived pain
   intensity score, stretched penile length measurement and the angle of
   penile deformity after an intracavernous injection with prostaglandin
   E1.
   RESULTS
   There was a clinically and statistically significant improvement in
   penile length, angle of curvature and pain after 12 weeks of using the
   vacuum pump. Of the 31 patients, 21 had a reduction in the angle of
   curvature by 5-25 degrees, three had worsening of the curvature and
   there was no change in the remaining seven. The curvature was corrected
   surgically in 15 patients while the remaining 16 (51\%) were satisfied
   with the outcome.
   CONCLUSION
   Vacuum therapy can improve or stabilize the curvature of PD, is safe to
   use in all stages of the disease, and might reduce the number of
   patients going on to surgery.}},

   of a fifteen year old male patient who reported with the complaint of
   swelling and mild pain in the lower right side of the jaw.
   Investigations revealed multiple cystic lesions in both upper and lower
   jaws which were found to be Odotogenic Keratocysts (OKC), presence of

Abstract = {{During assembly and budding of retroviruses, host cell proteins are
   incorporated into viral particles. Identification of virion-associated
   proteins may help pinpoint key cellular components required for virus
   production and function. The cellular protein annexin 2 (Anx2) is
   incorporated into HIV-1 particles, and knockdown of Anx2 has been
   reported to cause defects in Gag processing and infectivity of HIV-1
   particles in macrophages. Here, we tested whether Anx2 was required for
   HIV-1 production in other cell types capable of producing HIV-1 virions.
   Endogenous Anx2 levels were knocked down by similar to 98\% using
   lentivirus encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or small interfering
   RNAs (siRNAs) targeting Anx2. Under these conditions, there was no
   reduction in HIV-1 virus-like particle (VLP) production in either COS-1,
   293T, or Jurkat T cells or primary human monocyte-derived macrophages
   (MDMs). Murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from Anx2(-/-) mice
   produced the same levels of VLPs as matched cells from wild-type mice.
   The calcium-mediated spike in VLP production still occurred in
   Anx2-depleted COS-1 cells, and there was no apparent alteration in the
   intracellular Gag localization. Overexpression of Anx2 in trans had no
   effect on Gag processing or VLP production. Neither Anx2 depletion nor
   Anx2 overexpression altered the infectivity of HIV-1 particles produced
   by COS-1 or 293T cells. However, supernatants containing virus from Anx2
   siRNA-treated primary human MDMs exhibited decreased infectivity. These
   data indicate that Anx2 is not required for HIV-1 assembly or Gag
   processing but rather plays a cell type-dependent role in regulating
   production of infectious HIV-1 by macrophages.}},

Abstract = {{General purpose object-oriented programs typically aren't embarrassingly
   parallel. For these applications, finding enough concurrency remains a
   challenge in program design. To address this challenge, in the P (a)
   over tilde(n) over bar ini project we are looking at reconciling
   concurrent program design goals with modular program design goals. The
   main idea is that if programmers improve the modularity of their
   programs they should get concurrency for free. In this work we describe
   one of our directions to reconcile these two goals by enhancing
   Gang-of-Four (GOF) object-oriented design patterns. GOF patterns are
   commonly used to improve the modularity of object-oriented software.
   These patterns describe strategies to decouple components in design
   space and specify how these components should interact. Our hypothesis
   is that if these patterns are enhanced to also decouple components in
   execution space applying them will concomitantly improve the design and
   potentially available concurrency in software systems. To evaluate our
   hypothesis we have studied all 23 GOF patterns. For 18 patterns out of
   23, our hypothesis has held true. Another interesting preliminary result
   reported here is that for 17 out of these 18 studied patterns,
   concurrency and synchronization concerns were completely encapsulated in
   our concurrent design pattern framework.}},

   possibility of sensing the IR energy reflected back from the object. The
   proposed system can perform dynamic range enhancement, by utilizing an
   intelligent scheme, where, the output from the IR sensor system is used
   as a feedback to adaptively switch one of the IR LEDs. Experimental
   studies confirm that our developed system can indeed implement dynamic
   range enhancement, when compared to a conventional IR range finder
   system.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical multilayer, multispecies two-phase model for polymer
   electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) is presented based on fundamental
   molecular theory using the general transport equation (GTE). The GTE was
   previously developed and applied to bridge the gap that exists between
   the benchmark modeling philosophies in the literature for transport
   across the PEFC. In the current work, the GTE is applied with Darcy's
   law to describe water transport and water uptake through the porous and
   quasiporous layers of a PEFC under single-and two-phase operating
   conditions. The characteristic transport equations and available
   material properties from the literature are translated into a
   single-cell fuel cell model, which is implemented using the object
   modeling technique. The PEFC model is applied to predict and validate
   the net water transport ratio and water content under a range of
   operating conditions. The numerical model exhibits good agreement with
   experimental data under both vapor- and liquid-equilibrated conditions.
   The model is then applied in a water transport study to determine the
   effects of cell compression on local water content, liquid water
   intrusion, water transport, and Ohmic resistance across nonreinforced
   polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) under two-phase operating
   conditions. The modeling results suggest that the presence of liquid
   water at the cathodic boundary of the PEM and a well-established liquid
   water network can affect water uptake and water transport and can reduce
   the Ohmic resistance of the PEM. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4001004]}},

Abstract = {{Details of a customized cryogenic test system for use in in situ
   single-event radiation tests on semiconductor devices at cryogenic
   temperatures are presented. The lightweight portable system is designed
   for performing heavy-ion broadbeam single-event radiation testing at
   different beam facilities. It is designed for use with either liquid
   nitrogen or liquid helium as cryogens, depending on the desired lower
   temperature limit. A controlled heating system on the inside allows for
   single-event radiation tests as a function of temperature. To enable
   single-event strikes at angles, the device under test can be rotated
   about a vertical axis without having to break vacuum. Electrical
   connectivity to the device under test is provided through six fully
   customizable hermetically sealed connecting ports. The system has been
   used to conduct single-event tests over temperature on a test circuit
   fabricated in IBM CMOS 130 nm technology. Single-event transient pulse
   widths were found to increase by up to 30\% as the temperature was
   varied from - 135 degrees C to + 20 degrees C. Device simulations
   indicate that single-event-induced parasitic bipolar transistor turn-on
   in the n-well of PMOS transistors is responsible for the observed
   increase in pulse widths across the temperature ranges considered. (C)

Abstract = {{Initially thought to play a restricted role in calcium homeostasis, the
   pleiotropic actions of vitamin D in biology and their clinical
   significance are only now becoming apparent. However, the mode of action
   of vitamin D, through its cognate nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), and
   its contribution to diverse disorders, remain poorly understood. We
   determined VDR binding throughout the human genome using chromatin
   immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing
   (ChIP-seq). After calcitriol stimulation, we identified 2776 genomic
   positions occupied by the VDR and 229 genes with significant changes in
   expression in response to vitamin D. VDR binding sites were
   significantly enriched near autoimmune and cancer associated genes
   identified from genome-wide association (GWA) studies. Notable genes
   with VDR binding included IRF8, associated with MS, and PTPN2 associated
   with Crohn's disease and T1D. Furthermore, a number of single nucleotide
   polymorphism associations from GWA were located directly within VDR
   binding intervals, for example, rs13385731 associated with SLE and
   rs947474 associated with T1D. We also observed significant enrichment of
   VDR intervals within regions of positive selection among individuals of
   Asian and European descent. ChIP-seq determination of transcription
   factor binding, in combination with GWA data, provides a powerful
   approach to further understanding the molecular bases of complex
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Historical isolation during Pleistocene low sea level periods is thought
   to have contributed to divergence among marine basin populations across
   the Coral Triangle. In the Philippine archipelago, populations in the
   South China Sea, Sulu Sea-inland seas, and Philippine Sea-Celebes Sea
   basins might have been partially isolated. Meanwhile, present-day
   broadscale oceanographic circulation patterns suggest connectivity
   between these basins. To evaluate hypotheses regarding the influence of
   historical and contemporary factors on genetic structure,
   phylogeographic patterns based on mitochondrial control region sequences
   for a reef-associated fish, Siganus fuscescens, were analysed. Three
   distinct lineages were recovered. One lineage was identified as the
   morphologically similar species Siganus canaliculatus, while two
   lineages are monophyletic with S. fuscescens. Clade divergence and
   demographic expansion in S. fuscescens occurred during the Pleistocene.
   A strong signal of latitudinal structure was detected (Theta(CT) =
   0.188), driven by marked differences in clade distribution: one clade is
   widely distributed (clade A), while a second clade (clade B) has a
   restricted northern distribution. Regional structure of clade A is
   consistent with the basin isolation hypothesis (Theta(CT) = 0.040) and
   suggests isolation of the South China Sea (Theta(CT) = 0.091).
   Fine-scale structure was observed in the South China Sea and south
   Philippine Sea, while Sulu Sea and inland seas were unstructured.
   Genetic structure across multiple spatial scales (archipelagic,
   regional, and fine-scale within basins) suggests the influence of
   vicariant barriers and contemporary limits to gene flow in S. fuscescens
   that may be influenced by oceanographic circulation, geographical
   distance between available habitats, and latitudinal temperature
   differences.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of marine crabs as a source of biologically active
   products is largely unexplored. In the present study, antimicrobial
   activity of the hemolymph (plasma) and hemocytes (plasma cells) of six
   brachyuran crabs was investigated against 16 pathogenic strains. Among
   the 16 strains tested maximum zone of inhibition was recorded in the
   hemolymph of Hyas araneus against Shigella flexineri. Interestingly
   Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were susceptible to all the
   hemolymph and hemocytes samples. Likewise, the highest zone of
   inhibition was exhibited by both hemolymph and hemocytes samples against
   Vibrio cholerae. On the basis of TLC, (HNMR)-H-1, and (CNMR)-C-13 it may
   be concluded that the antimicrobial activity in the hemolymph extract is
   due to the presence of lipids. This observation is further supported by
   the ESI-MS of the methanolic extract of hemolymph of H. araneus. ESI-MS
   shows cluster of peaks in the region m/z 445 to m/z 491 due to
   lysoglycerolipids/glycerides and cluster of signals between m/z 216 and
   246, due to fatty acids/esters present in the sample.}},

Abstract = {{A tridentate nitrogen-sulfur Schiff base, 3-methylbenzyl
   2-(6-methylpyridin-2-ylmethylene) hydrazine carbodithioate (6mpyS3M),
   was synthesized by condensation of 6-methylpyridine-2-aldehyde with
   S-3-methylbenzyldithiocarbazate. It crystallized in space group P
   2(1)/n. It displayed intermolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot
   N hydrogen bonding between the alpha-nitrogen and the pyridyl nitrogen.
   The thione sulfur is in a trans position with respect to the
   6-methylpyridine fragment across the C-N bond but adopts a cis position
   with the 3-methylbenzyl fragment through the C-S bond. Octahedral
   complexes containing two 6mpyS3M ligands were prepared with Cu(II),
   Ni(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II). 6mpyS3M and its metal complexes were assayed
   against selected microbes and two breast cancer cell lines. 6mpyS3M was
   strongly active against both cancer cell lines. Its metal complexes
   showed high selectivity with Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes
   strongly active against only one of the cancer cell lines, whereas the
   Cd(II) complex was strongly active only against the other. Only Cu(II)
   and Cd(II) complexes were active against some of the bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid) is a water soluble vitamin which is an
   antioxidant and has a wide variety of biological functions for growth
   and development of the human body. It is very essential for immune
   enhancement in human beings. Vitamin C-deficiency and falciparum malaria
   are two major public health problems in developing countries. Falciparum
   malaria is associated with significant destruction of erythrocytes and
   leading to severe anaemia. The present study was delineated to estimate
   the serum ascorbic acid concentration in 150 acute falciparum-malaria
   patients (aged two to ten years). Serum ascorbate level concentrations
   of 20 healthy volunteers (aged two to ten years) were included as
   controls. The mean serum ascorbic acid concentration of healthy controls
   was 1.163 +/- 0.059 mg/dL and that of diseased cohort was 0.685 +/-
   0.0145 mg/dL. The mean parasitemia was 1239.2 +/- 33.609 per mu L. The
   diseased cohort demonstrated significant reduction in concentrations of
   ascorbic acid in comparison to healthy controls (p<0.001) and there was
   inverse relationship (coefficient of correlation r = -0.98) between
   parasitemia and serum ascorbic acid concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, some residency programs in emergency medicine (EM)
   have implemented scholarly tracks into their curricula. The goal of the
   scholarly track is to identify a niche in which each trainee focuses his
   or her scholarly work during residency. The object of this paper is to
   discuss the current use, structure, and success of resident scholarly
   tracks. A working group of residency program leaders who had implemented
   scholarly tracks into their residency programs collated their
   approaches, implementation, and early outcomes through a survey
   disseminated through the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency
   Directors (CORD) list-serve. At the 2009 CORD Academic Assembly, a
   session was held and attended by approximately 80 CORD members where the
   results were disseminated and discussed. The group examined the
   literature, discussed the successes and challenges faced during
   implementation and maintenance of the tracks, and developed a list of
   recommendations for successful incorporation of the scholarly track
   structure into a residency program. Our information comes from the
   experience at eight training programs (five 3-year and three 4-year
   programs), ranging from 8 to 14 residents per year. Two programs have
   been working with academic tracks for 8 years. Recommendations included
   creating clear goals and objectives for each track, matching track
   topics with faculty expertise, protecting time for both faculty and
   residents, and providing adequate mentorship for the residents. In
   summary, scholarly tracks encourage the trainee to develop an academic
   or clinical niche within EM during residency training. The benefits
   include increased overall resident satisfaction, increased success at
   obtaining faculty and fellowship positions after residency, and
   increased production of scholarly work. We believe that this model will
   also encourage increased numbers of trainees to choose careers in
   academic medicine.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper was to make a brief review of the main
   problematics raised by depression in oncology in terms of prevalence,
   semiology, screening, risk, prognosis factors and treatment. This
   reflection was based on recent literature data obtained through a PubMed
   search. Depressive disorders have frequently been encountered in cancer
   patients. During routine oncology daily care, depression screening,
   assessment and treatment are of paramount importance regarding
   psychosocial management. Depressive elements have a tremendous impact on
   the quality of life, tolerance and compliance with anticancer treatment.
   Moreover, depression morbidity and its possible influence on prognosis
   represent an important challenge in terms of prevention. A specific
   semiology for depressive disorders in the oncologic field might be more
   relevant with practical clinical implications. Optimal care of these
   mood disorders have to be implemented as soon as possible and be
   supported by the association of pharmacological treatment and
   psychotherapy. (C) 2010 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique

Abstract = {{Zoanthids comprise an order of benthic, generally colonial cnidarians,
   which can usually be distinguished from other hexacorallians by embedded
   sand and detritus in their mesoglea to help strengthen their structure.
   These animals are becoming increasingly important research subjects in
   biochemistry and other research fields. Their inclusion of both calcium
   and silica results in the need for both decalcification and
   desilification for internal morphological examinations. Since the
   methodology of hydrofluoric acid (HF) desilification has rarely been
   documented in zoanthids, histological surveys for zoanthid taxonomy have
   often been abandoned and their taxonomy is often problematic. Recent
   investigations utilizing molecular methods have brought a clearer
   understanding of zoanthid diversity, but standardization of HF
   treatments are still needed to provide a link between molecular and more
   traditional techniques, and to properly examine specimens for which
   molecular methods may not be an option (e.g., formalin-preserved
   specimens, etc.). Here, we use both ``straight{''} HF and, for the first
   time with zoanthids, buffered HF (BHF) treatments at different treatment
   lengths (1-48 h) on polyps from three different species of zoanthids for
   histological examination. Section conditions were judged based on the
   presence/absence of embedded detritus, drag marks, and tissue condition.
   Results show that the BHF treatment resulted in slightly better tissue
   conditions for all specimens, and suggest that desilification works well
   regardless of treatment time for species with smaller (polyp diameter <
   0.5 cm), less heavily encrusted polyps. Desilification of heavily
   encrusted Palythoa mutuki polyps were still problematic, with at least
   24 h treatment needed. To aid future research, we provide guidelines for
   HF treatments of zoanthid specimens.}},

Abstract = {{One of the reasons for resin-dentin degradation is poor polymerization
   of the adhesive layer. This study evaluated the effect of prolonged
   polymerization times on the immediate and 6-month resin-dentin bond
   strengths, silver nitrate uptake, and polymer quality of etch-and-rinse
   adhesives. Thirty extracted teeth were obtained, and a flat dentin
   surface was exposed on each tooth. Adhesives (Adper Single Bond 2 and
   One Step Plus) were applied to the dentin surface of these teeth and
   light-cured for 10, 20, or 40 s at 600 mW cm-2. Bonded sticks (0.6 mm2)
   were tested in tension (0.5 mm min-1) and analyzed, after immersion in
   50\% silver nitrate, using scanning electron microscopy. The polymer
   quality of adhesive films was evaluated using thermogravimetric
   analysis. Statistically higher bond strengths were observed for both
   adhesives when light-cured for 40 s. Degradation of dentin bonds
   occurred under all experimental conditions but it was less pronounced
   for adhesives light-cured for 40 s. Longer exposure times reduced silver
   nitrate uptake for Adper Single Bond 2. Solvent retention and the amount
   of residual monomer were statistically lower when both adhesives were
   light-cured for 40 s. Although longer exposure times than those
   recommended cannot prevent degradation of the dentin bonds, they can
   increase bond strength, probably because of the removal of an increased
   amount of solvent and the presence of a lower amount of residual
   monomer.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to examine the effects of dietary ascorbic acid
   (AsA) and phospholipid (PL) and their interaction on growth, survival,
   and stress resistance in red sea bream larvae. Twenty-six days old red
   sea bream were fed nine micro-bound diets supplemented three levels of
   AsA (0, 800 and 1600 mg kg-1 diet) and PL (0, 20 and 40 g kg-1 diet) for
   15 days. Dietary AsA and PL were both significant factors on survival
   rates. There was also an interaction between dietary AsA and PL on
   survival rate (P < 0.05). The larvae fed 800 or 1600 mg kg-1 AsA with 40
   g kg-1 PL diets showed the highest survival rate, with values similar to
   those of the live-food supplemented group. Stress resistance against low
   salinity exposure significantly increased with increased dietary level
   of AsA and PL. However, significant interaction of AsA and PL was not
   detected. The larvae fed 1600 mg kg-1 AsA with 40 g kg-1 PL diet showed
   the highest stress resistance among all diets, but it was not
   significantly different than that of larvae fed 800 mg kg-1 AsA with 40
   g kg-1 PL diet. This study clearly demonstrated that combined use of AsA
   and PL can improve survival of 26-40 days posthatching red sea bream
   larvae. Moreover, the present study suggested that 800 mg kg-1 AsA with
   40 g kg-1 PL in diet was needed for producing high quality seedling
   under the stressful conditions.}},

Abstract = {{RENTCH, J. S. (Division of Forestry and Natural Resources, P.O. Box

   between treefall direction, slope-aspect, and wind in eight old-growth
   oak stands in the Central Hardwood Forest, USA. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 137:
   391-400. 2010.-This study examined the relationship between direction of
   treefall, slope-aspect and prevailing wind in five old-growth stands
   where single-tree canopy gaps characterize the dominant disturbance
   regime. All live and downed trees were inventoried in 0.45-ha sample
   plots, and crown sizes of live trees were measured along two
   perpendicular axes. Directions of fall and slope-aspect of downed trees
   also were recorded. Regional prevailing winds and wind gusts were
   obtained from four nearby airports. I used circular statistics to
   determine if directions of treefall for each study stand had a mean
   direction or if the directions of fall were uniformly distributed. If
   directions of treefall had a true mean, they were then compared to mean
   slope aspect and prevailing wind directions. At two of eight plots,
   treefall directions were uniformly distributed (i.e., no mean
   direction). Only one plot showed a statistically significant similarity
   between mean slope-aspect and mean direction of fall, and only three of
   the eight study plots showed statistically significant similarities
   between mean treefall and wind directions. Mean crown asymmetry (ratio
   of long and short diameters) was 1.26, and there were no significant
   differences in asymmetry values when current gap border trees and non
   border trees were compared. While trees may fall downhill and downwind,
   the high variation in treefall and wind directions precluded
   establishing a consistent statistical relationship between these data
   sets. I suggest that crown asymmetry, resulting from differential crown
   growth of trees on sloped-hillsides and within canopy gaps, exerts a
   strong additional influence on direction of fall.}},

Abstract = {{We propose F-18-FDG PET as a method to monitor acute rejection of
   allogeneic renal transplants in a rat model. Methods: Allogeneically
   transplanted (aTX) rats (binephrectomized Lewis-brown Norway to Lewis)
   served as the renal transplant model. aTX rats treated with cyclosporine
   A (CSA) served as a therapy monitoring group. Healthy control rats, rats
   with acute CSA nephrotoxicity, rats with acute tubular necrosis,
   syngeneically transplanted (sTX) rats, and aTX rats treated with CSA
   since postoperative day 0 served as controls. After surgery, renal
   glucose metabolism was assessed in vivo serially up to postoperative day
   7 by performing small-animal PET 3 h after intravenous injection of 30
   MBq of F-18-FDG. Mean radioactivity (cps/mm(3) of tissue) was measured
   and the percentage injected dose calculated. Results were confirmed by
   histologic, functional, and autoradiographic analysis. Results: Renal
   F-18-FDG uptake was significantly elevated at postoperative day 4 in aTX
   rats, when compared with control, sTX, acute tubular necrosis, or
   CSA-treated rats (P < 0.05). In vivo F-18-FDG uptake correlated with the
   results of autoradiography and with inflammatory infiltrates observed on
   histologic examination. Notably, F-18-FDG PET assessed the response to
   therapy 48 h earlier than the time at which serum creatinine decreased
   and when histologic examination still showed signs of allograft
   rejection. In aTX rats, the CSA-susceptible graft infiltrate was
   dominated by activated cytotoxic T cells and monocytes/macrophages.
   Conclusion: F-18-FDG PET is an option to noninvasively assess early
   response to therapy in rat renal allograft rejection.}},

Abstract = {{Apoptosis of motor neurons is a well-documented feature in amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related motor neuron diseases (MNDs).
   However, the role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of these diseases
   remains unresolved. One possibility is that the affected motor neurons
   only succumb to apoptosis once they have exhausted functional capacity.
   If true, blocking apoptosis should confer no therapeutic benefit. To
   directly investigate this idea, we tested whether tissue-specific
   deletion in the mouse CNS of BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) and
   BCL2-homologous antagonist/killer (BAK), 2 proapoptotic BCL-2 family
   proteins that together represent an essential gateway to the
   mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, would protect against motor neuron
   degeneration. We found that neuronal deletion of Bax and Bak in a mouse
   model of familial ALS not only halted neuronal loss, but prevented
   axonal degeneration, symptom onset, weight loss, and paralysis and
   extended survival. These results show that motor neurons damaged in ALS
   activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway early in the disease
   process and that apoptotic signaling directly contributes to
   neuromuscular degeneration and neuronal dysfunction. Hence, inhibiting
   apoptosis upstream of mitochondrial permeabilization represents a
   possible therapeutic strategy for preserving functional motor neurons in
   ALS and other MNDs.}},

Abstract = {{Actin filaments constitute one of the main components of cell
   cytoskeleton. Assembled into bundles in filopodia or in stress fibres,
   they play a pivotal role in eukaryotes during cell morphogenesis,
   adhesion and motility. The bundle emergence has been extensively related
   to specific actin regulators(1-3) in vivo(4-7). Such dynamic modulation
   was also highlighted by biochemical reconstitution of the actin-network
   assembly, in bulk solution or with biomimetic devices(8-18). However,
   the question of how geometrical boundaries, such as those encountered in
   cells, affect the dynamic formation of highly ordered actin structures
   remains poorly studied(14,19). Here we demonstrate that the nucleation
   geometry in itself can be the principal determinant of actin-network
   architecture. We developed a micropatterning method that enables the
   spatial control of actin nucleation sites for in vitro assays. Shape,
   orientation and distance between nucleation regions control filament
   orientation and length, filament-filament interactions and
   filopodium-like bundle formation. Modelling of filament growth and
   interactions demonstrates that basic mechanical and probabilistic laws
   govern actin assembly in higher-order structures.}},

Abstract = {{Reynolds R, Lakie M. Postmovement changes in the frequency and amplitude
   of physiological tremor despite unchanged neural output. J Neurophysiol
   104: 2020-2023, 2010. First published July 21, 2010;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00513.2010. Active or passive movement causes a temporary
   reduction in muscle stiffness that gradually returns to baseline levels
   when the muscle remains still. This effect, termed muscle thixotropy,
   alters the mechanical properties of the joint around which the muscle
   acts, reducing its resonant frequency. Because physiological tremor is
   affected by joint mechanics, this suggests that prior movement may alter
   tremor independently of neural output. To address this possibility,
   vertical acceleration of the outstretched prone hand was recorded in
   eight healthy subjects, along with EMG activity of the extensor
   digitorum communis muscle. A series of voluntary wrist flexion/extension
   movements was performed every 20 s, interspersed by periods during which
   hand position was maintained. Time-dependent changes in the amplitude
   and frequency of acceleration and EMG were analyzed using a continuous
   wavelet transform. Immediately following movement, acceleration
   displayed a significant increase in wavelet power accompanied by a
   reduction in peak frequency. During the postmovement period, power
   declined by 63\%, and frequency increased from 7.2 to 8.0 Hz. These
   changes occurred with an exponential time constant of 2-4 s, consistent
   with a thixotropic mechanism. In contrast to acceleration, EMG activity
   showed no significant changes despite being strongly related to
   acceleration during the movement itself. These results show that prior
   movement transiently increases the amplitude and reduces the frequency
   of physiological tremor, despite unchanging neural output. This effect
   is best explained by a reduction in joint stiffness caused by muscle
   thixotropy, highlighting the importance of mechanical factors in the
   genesis of physiological tremor.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new analytical method for vibration analysis of a
   cracked simply supported beam is investigated. By considering a
   nonlinear model for the fatigue crack, the governing equation of motion
   of the cracked beam is solved using perturbation method. The solution of
   the governing equation reveals the superharmonics of the fundamental
   frequency due to the nonlinear effects in the dynamic response of the
   cracked beam. Furthermore, considering such a solution, an explicit
   expression is also derived for the system damping changes due to the
   changes in the crack parameters, geometric dimensions and mechanical
   properties of the cracked beam. The results show that an increase in the
   crack severity and approaching the crack location to the middle of the
   beam increase the system damping. In order to validate the results,
   changes in the fundamental frequency ratios against the fatigue crack
   severities are compared with those of experimental results available in
   the literature. Also, a comparison is made between the free response of
   the cracked beam with a given crack depth and location obtained by the
   proposed analytical solution and that of the numerical method. The
   results of the proposed method agree with the experimental and numerical
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands are critical activators of innate
   immunity and are being developed as vaccine adjuvants. However, their
   utility in conjunction with viral vector-based vaccines remains unclear.
   In this study, we evaluated the impact of a variety of TLR ligands on
   antigen-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses elicited by a recombinant
   adenovirus serotype 26 (rAd26) vector expressing simian immunodeficiency
   virus Gag in mice. The TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) suppressed Gag-specific
   cellular immune responses, whereas the TLR4 ligands lipopolysaccharide
   and monophosphoryl lipid A substantially augmented the magnitude and
   functionality of these responses by a MyD88- and TRIF-dependent
   mechanism. These data demonstrate that TLR ligands can modulate the
   immunogenicity of viral vaccine vectors both positively and negatively.
   Moreover, these findings suggest the potential utility of TLR4 ligands

   cell(-1)). However, ciguatoxins were not detected by LC-MS/MS.
   Partitioned fractions of the cell extracts potentially containing
   maitotoxin were found to be very toxic to mice after intraperitoneal
   (i.p.) injection. A. carterae was also of interest as extracts of mass
   cultures caused respiratory paralysis in mice at high doses, both by
   i.p. injection and by oral administration. The Rarotongan isolate fell
   into a different clade to New Zealand A. carterae isolates, based on DNA
   sequence analysis, and also had a different toxin profile. As A.
   carterae co-occurred with G. australes, it may contribute to human
   poisonings attributed to CTX and warrants further investigation. A crude
   extract of C. monotis was of low toxicity to mice by i.p. injection, and

Abstract = {{Buoyancy has a substantial contribution to the total mechanical cost of
   diving in waterbirds. Most of the techniques currently employed to
   estimate buoyancy are based on measuring the volume of carcasses or
   forcibly submerged birds using the water displacement (Archimedes)
   principle. In such techniques, the voluntary control the bird might have
   over plumage and respiratory air volumes is neglected. Here, I propose
   an adjustment to the water displacement measurement that allows the
   measurement of buoyancy in real-time from unrestrained live birds diving
   voluntarily. The novelty and accuracy of the technique lie in using a
   pressure sensor to continuously measure the water level inside the dive
   tank while filtering out the interference from surface waves. The error
   of the volume measurement in the proposed technique was only +/- 2.4\%.
   Feasibility of measurement is demonstrated on captive Great Cormorants
   (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis). The measured volumes of Great Cormorants
   exceeded predictions made based on the volume of carcasses and on
   average resembled values measured from live restrained birds. However
   the technique highlighted the high variation in buoyancy of live birds
   (up to 30\%) as a result of small changes in the air volumes taken with
   the bird underwater.}},

Title = {{Endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric lesions: results of an
   European inquiry}},

Abstract = {{Background and study aims: In Japanese centers, endoscopic submucosal
   dissection (ESD) is commonly used for the resection of early gastric
   lesions. However, in Europe, only a few reports have been published. The
   aim of the current study was to survey the current use of ESD by
   European endoscopists.
   Methods: Between April and May 2009, European endoscopists (n = 490) who
   had articles published in the journals Endoscopy and/or Gastrointestinal
   Endoscopy during 2007 and 2008 were asked to complete an online
   questionnaire.
   Results: A total of 58 endoscopists completed the questionnaire (12 \%).
   Only 20 centers performed ESD, which was mostly performed by a single
   endoscopist in each center. Each endoscopist had treated a mean of four
   cases during the previous year (mean total experience 11 ESDs) bringing
   a total of 510 ESDs across all European centers that responded (197
   during the past year). Lesions were located in the antrum in 35\% of
   cases; 39\% were Paris classification IIa, 22\% IIa+b, and 18\% IIa+c.
   Overall, the average of mean lesion diameter was 15.7mm (range 1-70.0
   mm). Most cases were non-invasive high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia
   (44 \%) or adenocarcinoma (36 \%). An insulated-tipped knife (1 or 2)
   was used in 70\% of procedures and an average of the mean duration of
   procedures was 108 minutes. In all, 78\% of lesions were removed en bloc
   with an R0 rate of 77\%. Endoscopists experienced major complications
   (perforation or major bleeding) in 13\% of cases.
   Conclusion: ESD in Europe seems to be performed at a few centers, with
   most endoscopists performing a low number of procedures, achieving a
   high rate of efficacy and a moderate rate of major complications.
   However, as a potential selection bias may have occurred, multicenter
   registries should be conducted to help address the problem of
   dissemination of this technique.}},

Abstract = {{At first glance, Part 3-1 of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) seems to
   overlap with long-established anti-discrimination laws, offering
   protection against adverse, attribute-based conduct in employment. On
   close analysis, however, it turns out to be a new and quite different
   regime. Although the Fair Work Act offers a simple alternative to dated
   and complicated anti-discrimination laws, its provisions are at times
   overly-simple, raising uncertainty about how they will operate. Our
   analysis leads us to conclude that the approach to discrimination
   protection in the Fair Work Act, while an important addition to the
   remedies available to Australian workers, is compromised by failing to
   take account of lessons learned in the long history of
   anti-discrimination law.}},

Journal = {{SMPTE MOTION IMAGING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{62-67}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A gain screen is a technology used to increase the light levels seen by
   the audience without increasing the output of the projector. The quoted
   gain of the screen is the location of the highest gain, which is
   available at a single location on the screen (the hot spot), and for a
   limited number of seat locations near the center aisles. However, the
   perceived brightness of the image on the screen is not solely determined
   by the peak brightness of the hot spot, nor is the seat in the center of
   the auditorium the only location with an audience member. The perceived
   brightness, a subjective quantity, is more closely related to the total
   amount of light reflecting from the screen to the viewer than to the
   single hot spot point. Objectively, what we really want to know is the
   Lumen value at the viewer's location, rather than the foot-Lambert value
   of a single point on the screen. Measuring the gain of the screen at
   many locations in the theater is not practical, but fortunately the
   information to calculate the gain at each seat exists in the screen
   specification sheets, and the room geometry. Once the screen gain is
   calculated for each seat in the auditorium, the overall effective screen
   gain can be determined from their average. A method is demonstrated for
   calculating this average screen gain and the overall effective room
   light level. The gain averaged over the screen and over all seats in the
   auditorium is always lower than the quoted gain of the screen. For 3D
   systems using silver screens, the average left eye/right eye crosstalk
   across the screen is negatively impacted by the screen doing an
   imperfect job of maintaining polarization, especially at the edges of
   the auditorium. Larger values of crosstalk are coincident with poor
   performance from both a gain and uniformity standpoint.}},

Abstract = {{The microenvironment of cells in vivo is defined by spatiotemporal
   patterns of chemical and biophysical cues. Therefore, one important goal
   of tissue engineering is the generation of scaffolds with defined
   biofunctionalization in order to control processes like cell adhesion
   and differentiation. Mimicking extrinsic factors like integrin ligands
   presented by the extracellular matrix is one of the key elements to
   study cellular adhesion on biocompatible scaffolds. By using special
   thermoformable polymer films with anchored biomolecules micro structured
   scaffolds, e.g. curved and A mu-patterned substrates, can be fabricated.
   Here, we present a novel strategy for the fabrication of A mu-patterned
   scaffolds based on the ``Substrate Modification and Replication by
   Thermoforming{''} (SMART) technology: The surface of a poly lactic acid
   membrane, having a low forming temperature of 60A degrees C and being
   initially very cell attractive, was coated with a photopatterned layer
   of poly(L-lysine) (PLL) and hyaluronic acid (VAHyal) to gain spatial
   control over cell adhesion. Subsequently, this modified polymer membrane
   was thermoformed to create an array of spherical microcavities with
   diameters of 300 A mu m for 3D cell culture. Human hepatoma cells
   (HepG2) and mouse fibroblasts (L929) were used to demonstrate guided
   cell adhesion. HepG2 cells adhered and aggregated exclusively within
   these cavities without attaching to the passivated surfaces between the
   cavities. Also L929 cells adhering very strongly on the pristine
   substrate polymer were effectively patterned by the cell repellent
   properties of the hyaluronic acid based hydrogel. This is the first time
   cell adhesion was controlled by patterned functionalization of a
   polymeric substrate with UV curable PLL-VAHyal in thermoformed 3D
   microstructures.}},

Abstract = {{This study documents the global distribution and characteristics of
   diurnally varying low-level jets (LLJs), including their horizontal,
   vertical, and temporal structure, with a special emphasis on
   highlighting the underlying commonalities and unique qualities of the
   various nocturnal jets. Two tools are developed to accomplish this goal.
   The first is a 21-yr global reanalysis performed with the
   fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model
   (MM5) using a horizontal grid spacing of 40 km. A unique characteristic
   of the reanalysis is the availability of hourly three-dimensional
   output, which permits the full diurnal cycle to be analyzed.
   Furthermore, the horizontal grid spacing of 40 km better resolves many
   physiographic features that host LLJs than other widely used global
   reanalyses. This makes possible a detailed examination of the systematic
   onset and cessation of the jets, including time-height representations
   of the diurnal cycle. The second tool is an index of nocturnal LLJ
   (NLLJ) activity based upon the vertical structure of the wind's temporal
   variation, where the temporal variation is defined in local time. The
   first available objectively constructed global maps of recurring NLLJs
   are created from this index, where the various NLLJs can be
   simultaneously viewed at or near their peak time. These maps not only
   highlight all of the locations where NLLJs are known to recur, but they
   also reveal a number of new jets.
   The authors examine the basic mechanisms that give rise to the NLLJs
   identified in four disparate locations, each having a profound influence
   on the regional climate. The first, the extensively studied Great Plains
   NLLJ, is used to confirm the veracity of the global analysis and the
   index of NLLJ activity. It also provides context for three of the many
   newly identified NLLJs: 1) Tarim Pendi in northwest China; 2) Ethiopia
   in eastern Africa; and 3) Namibia-Angola in southwest Africa. Jets in
   these four regions illustrate the variety of physiographic and thermal
   forcing mechanisms that can produce NLLJs.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a dramatic increase in the nonmedical use of prescription drugs
   among illicit drug users, their motives for abusing prescription drugs
   are still largely unknown. The objective of this study was to (a)
   determine the motivations for engaging in the nonmedical use of
   prescription opioids and sedatives among street-based illicit drug
   users, methadone maintenance patients, and residential drug treatment
   clients; (b) examine associations between prescription drug abuse
   motivations and gender, age, race/ethnicity, and user group; and (c)
   examine associations between specific motivations and prescription drug
   abuse patterns. Quantitative surveys (n = 684) and in-depth interviews
   (n = 45) were conducted with a diverse sample of prescription drug
   abusers in South Florida between March 2008 and November 2009. The three
   most common motivations reported were ``to get high,{''} ``to sleep,{''}
   and ``for anxiety/stress.{''} There were age, race/ethnicity, and gender
   differences by motives. Prescription drug abuse patterns were also found
   to be associated with specific motivations. Although additional research
   is needed, these findings serve to inform appropriate prevention and
   treatment initiatives for prescription drug abusers. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{Internal representation of task rules by recurrent dynamics: the
   importance of the diversity of neural responses}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Neural activity of behaving animals, especially in the prefrontal
   cortex, is highly heterogeneous, with selective responses to diverse
   aspects of the executed task. We propose a general model of recurrent
   neural networks that perform complex rule-based tasks, and we show that
   the diversity of neuronal responses plays a fundamental role when the
   behavioral responses are context-dependent. Specifically, we found that
   when the inner mental states encoding the task rules are represented by
   stable patterns of neural activity (attractors of the neural dynamics),
   the neurons must be selective for combinations of sensory stimuli and
   inner mental states. Such mixed selectivity is easily obtained by
   neurons that connect with random synaptic strengths both to the
   recurrent network and to neurons encoding sensory inputs. The number of
   randomly connected neurons needed to solve a task is on average only
   three times as large as the number of neurons needed in a network
   designed ad hoc. Moreover, the number of needed neurons grows only
   linearly with the number of task-relevant events and mental states,
   provided that each neuron responds to a large proportion of events
   (dense/distributed coding). A biologically realistic implementation of
   the model captures several aspects of the activity recorded from monkeys
   performing context-dependent tasks. Our findings explain the importance
   of the diversity of neural responses and provide us with simple and
   general principles for designing attractor neural networks that perform
   complex computation.}},

   Paludicella articulata, and three phylactolaemates, Fredericella sultana
   with a circular funnel-shaped lophophore, and Cristatella mucedo and

Volume = {{147}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1443-1460}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Female mimicry is commonly considered in the context of alternative
   mating tactics as mimics can avoid male male competition to gain
   increased access to females. We describe a case where one of the
   benefits to being a female mimic could be the increase in size of a
   sexually selected trait that should eventually decrease the mimics'
   ability to fool males. In the sword-tail fish Xiphophorus
   nezahualcoyotl, a small percentage of males have a permanent pigment
   pattern known as `false brood spot' (FBS), express a horizontal bar
   pigment pattern common for females, and yet have longer swords (a
   sexually selected trait) for their body size. FBS males did not use more
   `coercive' behaviours in the field, and females do not appear to
   distinguish between males based on whether or not they have FBS in the
   laboratory. However, in the field males with FBS were chased less by
   other males, spent significantly more time feeding, and those that
   expressed the horizontal bar had greater access to females. We suggest
   that FBS males with swords can still fool other males into thinking they
   are females because the true brood spot remains informative as long as
   the frequency of FBS males (mimics) remains low.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the treatment effects of
   non-thermal atmospheric gas plasmas on dentin surfaces used for
   composite restoration. Extracted unerupted human third molars were
   prepared by removing the crowns and etching the exposed dentin surfaces
   with 35\% phosphoric acid gel. The dentin surfaces were treated using a
   non-thermal atmospheric argon plasma brush for various periods of time.
   The molecular changes of the dentin surfaces were analyzed using Fourier
   transform infrared spectrophotometry/attenuated total reflectance
   (FTIR/ATR), and an increase in the amount of carbonyl groups was
   detected on plasma-treated dentin surfaces. Adper Single Bond Plus
   adhesive and Filtek Z250 dental composite were applied as directed. To
   evaluate the dentin/composite interfacial bonding, the teeth thus
   prepared were sectioned into micro-bars and analyzed using tensile
   testing. Student-Newman-Keuls tests showed that the bonding strength of
   the composite restoration to peripheral dentin was significantly
   increased (by 64\%) after 30 s of plasma treatment. However, the bonding
   strength to plasma-treated inner dentin did not show any improvement. It
   was found that plasma treatment of the peripheral dentin surface for up
   to 100 s resulted in an increase in the interfacial bonding strength,
   while prolonged plasma treatment of dentin surfaces (e.g. 5 min)
   resulted in a decrease in the interfacial bonding strength.}},

Abstract = {{Oil sand is a mixture of quartz grains, clay minerals, bitumen, water,
   and minor accessory minerals. There is a need in oil sands mining
   operations for a robust method to estimate total bitumen content in real
   time; and so modelling of the total bitumen content (TBC) in Athabasca
   oil sands of Western Canada was undertaken on the basis of hyperspectral
   reflectance spectra. A selection of different bitumen, water, and clay
   mineral spectral features (3.0-30.0 mu m) was used to develop broad-band
   TBC predictive models that have good accuracy, with less than 1.5\%
   error with respect to laboratory methods of bitumen assay. These models
   are also robust, in that they are independent of mine location. Simple
   broad band models, based upon previously identified Gaussian features or
   wavelet features, provide an incremental improvement over the currently
   deployed industry two-band ratio model. An improved two-band model was
   also developed, which makes use of a combination of the same two bands
   but normalised to their mean. A wavelet-based, broad-band model
   comprised of indices and five bands, where the bands are normalised to
   the mean of the bands, adequately addresses the influence of water,
   clay, and textural variation on selected bitumen features. This
   five-band model appears to produce the most robust estimator of TBC,
   with a dispersion of similar to 1.1-1.5\%, which can be applied to
   different sites within a mine and to different mines without additional
   tuning or calibration, as evidenced by regression slopes of 0.99-1.0 for
   modelling, validation, and blind data sets.}},

   Emerita (Merida, Spain), specifically those found in the Mithraeum
   House. In particular, we describe and characterise the hydraulic mortars
   and coatings of the viridarium water channel. The recipient of the
   channel was covered with two hydraulic mortars and a finishing coating.
   Hydrated lime was used as binder. Calcite grains with different
   morphology have been observed in the mortars studied. The siliceous
   aggregate was composed of quartz, mica and feldspars. Ceramic fragments,
   which were added to the mortar to improve its hydraulic properties, were
   composed of quartz, mica, iron oxides, anorthite and an amorphous phase;
   aluminium-iron silicates were used as raw materials for their
   manufacture. We discuss the interactions between the hydrated lime and
   the surface of the ceramics in the mortars. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Images of cellular structures in growing plant roots acquired using
   confocal laser scanning microscopy have some unusual properties that
   make motion estimation challenging. These include multiple motions,
   non-Gaussian noise and large regions with little spatial structure. In
   this paper, a method for motion estimation is described that uses a
   robust multi-frame likelihood model and a technique for estimating
   uncertainty. An efficient region-based matching approach was used
   followed by a forward projection method. Over small timescales the
   dynamics are simple (approximately locally constant) and the change in
   appearance small. Therefore, a constant local velocity model is used and
   the MAP estimate of the joint probability over a set of frames is
   recovered. Occurrences of multiple modes in the posterior are detected,
   and in the case of a single dominant mode, motion is inferred using
   Laplace'e method. The method was applied to several Arabidopsis thaliana
   root growth sequences with varying levels of success. In addition,
   comparative results are given for three alternative motion estimation
   approaches, the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi tracker, Black and Anandan's robust
   smoothing method, and Markov random field based methods.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations into the nature of mate choice suggest that variation in
   female mate preferences is often context dependent, varying in response
   to genetic and environmental influences on female condition as well as
   to external environmental stimuli. Determining whether variation in
   female mate preference is adaptive requires understanding the variables
   involved that produce this variation and how they interact. Comparative,
   multivariate studies of wild-caught adult females can be used as initial
   assessments of variation in female mate preferences, providing valuable
   insights into the parameters that influence female preferences under
   natural conditions. We examined variation in female preferences for the
   pigment pattern vertical bars across five populations of the swordtail,
   Xiphophorus cortezi. The populations we examined are genetically
   differentiated and varied in the frequency of males and females with
   bars. We also considered a variable indicative of within-individual
   variation (size, as influenced by age) and a variable that varies across
   individuals (genotype for vertical bars: barred or barless). Using
   Akaike information criterion, all candidate models explaining variation
   in strength of preference included female bar state, female size, and
   population. We suggest that a combination of genetic (bar state) and
   environmental (female size) conditions influenced how they responded to
   experience with both male phenotypes in X. cortezi. Future studies
   should examine the possibility that barred and barless females respond
   differently over an environmental gradient.}},

Title = {{Effects of density, climate, and supplementary forage on body mass and

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{164}},

Abstract = {{The influence of short- and long-term (cohort) effects of climate and
   density on the life-histories of ungulates in temperate regions may vary
   with latitude, habitat, and management practices, but the life-histories
   of ungulates in the Mediterranean region are less well known. This study
   examined the short- and long-term effects of rainfall and absolute
   density on hinds in two of the southernmost populations of red deer
   (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) in Europe. One population received
   supplementary forage. Unlike more northerly latitudes, where red deer
   hinds lose body mass in winter as a result of adverse weather, in the
   Spanish populations, hinds did not lose body mass. Hinds in the
   population that received supplementary forage were heavier and more
   likely to become pregnant than were the hinds in the unsupplemented
   population. The likelihood of pregnancy occurring was strongly
   influenced by hind body mass; the proportion of yearlings that became
   pregnant was consequently lower in the unsupplemented population than in
   the population that received supplementary forage. Cohort effects on
   hind body mass (negative for density and positive for rainfall at birth)
   and on the probability of pregnancy (negative for density at birth) were
   apparent only in the unsupplemented population, which implies that
   supplemental feeding may partially compensate for negative
   density-dependent factors during early growth, and that supplemented
   deer hinds may experience reduced selection pressures. These results
   reflect the particular seasonal variation in the abundance and quality
   of food in Mediterranean habitats. The delayed effects of climate and
   density at birth on adult hind body mass and the prevalence of pregnancy
   probably affects population dynamics and constitutes a mechanism by
   which cohort effects affect the population dynamics in Iberian red deer.
   The management of Iberian red deer populations should take into account
   cohort effects and supplemental feeding practices, which can buffer
   density- and climate-dependent effects and reduce natural selection
   pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Ciguatera fish poisoning characterizes the intoxication caused by
   consumption of fish from tropical and subtropical areas, which have
   accumulated ciguatoxins (CTXs). The observed pattern of ciguatoxins in
   fish highly depends on the marine region and the causative organisms. It
   is evident that differences exist between ciguatoxins produced by
   certain strains of the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus and other
   Gambierdiscus spp. In this context cultured strains purchased from the
   Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton
   (CCMP) and strains from Vietnam were analyzed. Besides, lyophilized
   samples of several Gambierdiscus spp. from the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), USA and lyophilized samples of G.
   toxic-us from Vietnam were analyzed. The latter has been cultured at
   different salinities.
   We observed differences between the toxin ratios of the analogues in the
   strain from Vietnam depending on the salinity. The CTX profiles of the
   Vietnamese samples were compared with cultures of Gambierdiscus spp.
   from CCMP and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
   resulting in an overview of toxins in cultures from different regions.
   Hence, it was obvious that the strain from Vietnam forms a
   characteristic CTX profile which is not directly comparable to CTX
   pattern observed in other tropical marine regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier

   fish, crabs, squids and shrimps were the major component of food items.
   Priacanthus hamrur was the most preyed upon fish with a high I RI

   squid Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis (15.5\%) and prawn Solenocera hextii

Abstract = {{The depot of the MRT Chaloem Ratchamongkhon line in Bangkok was designed
   and constructed as an elevated concrete platform structure of some 250
   000 m(2), supported by 17 000 driven prestressed, precast concrete
   piles. The design of piles considered full hydrostatic pressure in the
   long term, with soft clay negative skin friction due to the ongoing land
   subsidence. These requirements required that the piles be founded
   sufficiently in a deep sand stratum in order to ensure an adequate
   factor of safety against bearing capacity failure. This paper reports on
   the rigorous construction control procedures that were implemented with
   the aid of a pile driving analyser, in order to ensure that the design
   requirements were achieved. The procedures included monitoring the drive
   system performance, driving stresses, assessment of pile integrity and
   evaluation of pile capacity. The timely development and implementation
   of these procedures was fundamental to the early completion of piling,
   and to confidence in the integrity and capacity of the piles.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers have invested much effort in constructing models of the
   state-dependent (sometimes risk-averse and sometimes risk-prone) nature
   of human decision making. An important open question is how
   state-dependent risk behavior can arise and remain prominent in
   populations. We believe that one part of the answer is the interplay
   between risk-taking and sequentiality of choices in populations subject
   to evolutionary population dynamics. To support this hypothesis, we
   provide simulation and analytical results for evolutionary lottery
   games, including results on evolutionary stability. We consider a
   parameterized class of imitation dynamics in which the parameter 0 <= a
   <= 1 yields the replicator dynamic with alpha = 1 and the
   imitate-the-better dynamic with alpha = 0. Our results demonstrate that
   for every population dynamic in this class except for the replicator
   dynamic, the interplay between risk-taking and sequentiality of choices
   allows state-dependent risk behavior to have an evolutionary advantage
   over expected-value maximization.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a parametric investigation of aluminum-water reaction
   to generate hydrogen, using a novel activated aluminum powder. An
   original thermo-chemical process involving a small fraction of a
   lithium-based activator enables a spontaneous reaction of the activated
   aluminum particles with water, which otherwise would not react due to
   the existence of an oxide or hydroxide surface layer. Experiments have
   shown that a fast, self sustained reaction of activated aluminum with
   water takes place even at room temperature and, for appropriate
   operating conditions, results in a practically 100\% yield of hydrogen
   generation. The reaction rate may be controlled by the aluminum particle
   size, water temperature, metal activation conditions and metal/water
   mass ratio. The method demonstrates safe and compact hydrogen storage
   (11 wt\% compared to the aluminum). Among its potential applications may
   be fuel cells, as well as automotive and marine propulsion. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Background: Regional prefrontal cortex gray matter reductions have been
   identified in schizophrenia, likely reflecting a combination of genetic
   vulnerability and disease effects. Few morphometric studies to date have
   examined regional prefrontal abnormalities in non-psychotic biological
   relatives who have not passed through the age range of peak risk for
   onset of psychosis. We conducted a region-of-interest morphometric study
   of prefrontal subregions in adolescent and young adult relatives of
   schizophrenia patients.
   Methods: Twenty-seven familial high-risk (FHR) first-degree relatives of
   schizophrenia patients and forty-eight control subjects without a family
   history of psychosis (ages 13-28) underwent high-resolution magnetic
   resonance imaging at 1.5 Tesla. The prefrontal cortex was parcellated
   into polar, dorsolateral, ventrolateral, ventromedial and orbital
   subregions. The Chapman scales measured subpsychotic symptoms. General
   linear models examined associations of prefrontal subregion volumes with
   familial risk and subpsychotic symptoms.
   Results: FHR subjects had significantly reduced bilateral ventromedial
   prefrontal and frontal pole gray matter volumes compared with controls.
   Ventromedial volume was significantly negatively correlated with magical
   ideation and anhedonia scores in FHR subjects.
   Conclusions: Selective, regional prefrontal gray matter reductions may
   differentially mark genetic vulnerability and early symptom processes
   among non-psychotic young adults at familial risk for schizophrenia. (C)

Abstract = {{We have shown that the methodology based on the estimation of
   root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between two sets of chemical shifts is
   very useful to rapidly assign the spectral signatures of H-1(N),
   C-13(alpha), C-13(beta), C-13', H-1(alpha) and N-15 spins of a given
   protein in one state from the knowledge of its resonance assignments in
   a different state, without resorting to routine established procedures
   (manual and automated). We demonstrate the utility of this methodology
   to rapidly assign the 3D spectra of a metal-binding protein in its
   holo-state from the knowledge of its assignments in apo-state, the
   spectra of a protein in its paramagnetic state from the knowledge of its
   assignments in diamagnetic state and, finally, the spectra of a mutant
   protein from the knowledge of the chemical shifts of the corresponding
   wild-type protein. The underlying assumption of this methodology is
   that, it is impossible for any two amino acid residues in a given
   protein to have all the six chemical shifts degenerate and that the
   protein under consideration does not undergo large conformational
   changes in going from one conformational state to another. The
   methodology has been tested using experimental data on three proteins,
   M-crystallin (8.5 kDa, predominantly beta-sheet, for apo- to
   holo-state), Calbindin (7.5 kDa, predominantly alpha-helical, for
   diamagnetic to paramagnetic state and apo to holo) and EhCaBP1 (14.3
   kDa, alpha-helical, the wild-type protein with one of its mutant). In
   all the cases, the extent of assignment is found to be greater than
   85\%. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK) gene is crucially involved in
   neuronal plasticity and microtubule-guided retrograde transport of
   signaling molecules. We have explored the possibility that DCLK is
   involved in pain-induced signaling events in adult male Wistar rats. Our
   results show that both DCLK-short and DCLK-long splice variants are
   present in the cell body and proximal dendrites of neurons in
   stress-related nuclei, ie, the paraventricular nucleus of the
   hypothalamus (PVN) and the non-preganglionic Edinger-Westphal nucleus
   (npEW) in the rostroventral periaqueductal grey. We found that DCLK-long
   but not DCLK-short is phosphorylated in its serine/proline-rich domain.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of DCLK-long in the
   npEW is increased by acute pain, whereas DCLK-long phosphorylation in
   the PVN remains unaffected. This is the first report revealing that DCLK
   isoforms in the PVN and npEW occur in the adult mammalian brain and that
   pain differentially affects DCLK-long-mediated neuronal plasticity in
   these 2 stress-sensitive brain centers.
   Perspective: Pain is a burden for society and the individual, and
   although the mechanisms underlying pain are relatively well known, its
   treatment remains difficult and incomplete. Pain stress can lead to
   diseases like chronic pain and depression. The differential
   DCLK-phosphorylation in stress-sensitive brain areas is a potential
   novel therapeutic target in pain research. (C) 2010 by the American Pain

Abstract = {{Previous studies on fracture networks have shown that fractures
   contained within distinct mechanical units ({''}stratabound{''}) are
   regularly spaced while those that terminate within the rock mass are
   clustered ({''}non-stratabound{''}). Lacunarity is a parameter which can
   quantify the distribution of spaces between rock fractures. When
   normalized to account for differences in fracture abundance, lacunarity
   characterizes the distribution of spaces as the degree of clustering in
   the fracture network. Normalized lacunarity curves, L{*}(r), computed
   using the gliding-box algorithm and plotted as a function of box-size,
   r, were constructed for natural fracture patterns from Telpyn Point,
   Wales and the Hornelen basin, Norway. The results from analysis of the
   Telpyn Point fractures indicate that such curves are sensitive to
   differences in the clustering of different fracture sets at the same
   scale. For fracture networks mapped at different scales from the
   Hornelen basin, our analysis shows that clustering increases with
   decreasing spatial scale. This trend is attributed to the transition
   from a ``stratabound{''} system at the scale of sedimentary cycles
   (100-200 m) that act as distinct mechanical units to a
   ``non-stratabound{''} fracture system geometry at the finer 10's of
   meters thick bedding scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Determination of initiation fracture toughness of ductile materials is a
   challenging task due to the ambiguity associated with the identification
   of the point of departure of the initial linear region of the fracture
   resistance curve. Acoustic emission (AE) is a technique that is capable

   toughness tests using a single specimen. The objective of this
   investigation is to illustrate some results related to monotonic and
   cyclic fracture behaviour of AISI 304LN weldments estimated by this
   `combined type' experiment. The use of cyclic J-integral tests has been
   proposed to simulate the deleterious effect of periodic load reversals
   during monotonic loading. A comparative analysis of all these data leads
   to the conclusion that the fracture toughness of a material determined
   from AE parameters is generally conservative compared to that obtained
   by conventional techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to their unique properties, ferrocene compounds are gaining
   increasing interest for biological applications, particularly as enzyme
   inhibitors. Phosphonate derivatives including a ferrocenyl moiety were
   synthesized by reaction of dimethyl- and diphenylphosphite with
   ferrocenyl methyl maleimide. The ferrocenyl diphenyl phosphonate complex
   was characterized by X-ray diffraction. The ability of these
   organometallic compounds to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the serine
   esterases acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase was investigated. It
   appeared that the new ferrocenyl phosphonates inhibited both enzymes by
   competitive, mixed or non competitve mechanisms with inhibition
   constants in the range 35-1000 mu M. Both compounds also behave as slow
   time-dependent inactivators of butyrylcholinesterase. The presence of
   the ferrocenyl entity seems then to have a dramatic effect on the
   biochemical behavior of the systems. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Eleven fragments of the meteorite Almahata Sitta (AHS) have been
   analyzed for oxygen isotopes. The fragments were separately collected as
   individual stones from the meteorite's linear strewn field in the Nubian
   Desert. Each of the fragments represents a sample of a different and
   distinct portion of asteroid 2008 TC(3). Ten of the fragments span the
   same range of values of delta 18O, delta 17O, and Delta 17O, and follow
   the same trend along the carbonaceous chondrite anhydrous minerals
   (CCAM) line as monomict and polymict members of the ureilite family of
   meteorites. The oxygen isotope composition of fragment \#25 is
   consistent with its resemblance petrographically to an H5 ordinary
   chondrite. Our results demonstrate that a single small asteroidal parent
   body, asteroid 2008 TC(3), only 4 m in length, encompassed the entire
   range of variation in oxygen isotope compositions measured for monomict
   and polymict ureilites.}},

Abstract = {{Methods: A panel of oncology products approved by the European Medicines
   Agency (EMA) in the period 2006-2008 was considered. The explored
   sequential phases included the times to market for: the EMA;
   pharmaceutical companies; the Italian Medicines Agency (Agenzia Italiana
   del Farmaco, AIFA); and IRs as final providers of health care. The IR's
   time to market was also analyzed by a Cox regression model.
   Results: The overall mean time required before patients access was 2.3
   years. EMA accounted for the greater proportion of time (31.8\%),
   followed by AIFA (28.2\%). However, the duration for both pharmaceutical
   companies and IRs was associated with the highest variability. An
   oncology product authorized with a risk-sharing agreement showed an
   early access in the IRs. On the contrary, the introduction in IRs having
   a compulsory formulary was delayed. Both a high forecast of economic
   impact and a high oncology product price can also delay the patient
   access.
   Conclusion: The process before patient access to an oncology product is
   time and cost consuming. This study identifies the main predictors that
   affect the missing overlap between market and patient access in Italy.}},

Abstract = {{Hanging is one of the commonest medico-legal entities that a forensic
   pathologist may come across and is almost always a suicide. We report a
   case of homicide by hanging, masquerading as a sudden death, where a
   32-year-old man was hanged by his wife, helped by her boyfriend, who
   nearly escaped from the grip of the law. The autopsy findings were
   almost in keeping with that of a suicidal suspension except for the
   small contusion in the inner aspect of the lower lip and multiple
   abrasions in the lower part of the legs, which were due to the struggle
   and terminal asphyxial movements. Furthermore, the victim was under the
   influence of alcohol, which is usually expected in a case of this
   nature.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A study in the general population has shown a higher acute
   respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) mortality among blacks. We studied
   whether black blunt-trauma patients experience different ARDS incidence,
   ARDS-associated mortality, or ARDS case fatality rates.
   Methods: National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) extracts of blunt-trauma
   patients with Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 16 and length of
   stay greater than 3 days were used for this study. ARDS incidence,
   ARDS-associated mortality, and ARDS case fatality rates were calculated
   for Caucasians, blacks, and Hispanics, and compared using chi(2). In
   order to adjust for confounders (age, gender, comorbidities,
   hypotension, and injury severity) multiple logistic regression models
   were built for the 3 outcomes. Odd ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence
   intervals (Cls) were calculated. A p < .05 was used for all statistics.
   Results: Among the 96350 patients studied, ARDS incidence,
   ARDS-associated mortality, and ARDS case fatality rates were 0.92\%,
   0.18\%, and 19.1\%, respectively. Differences among racial/ethnic groups
   were found between blacks and Caucasians for ARDS incidence (0.70\% vs
   0.93\%) and between Hispanic and Caucasians for ARDS-associated
   mortality (0.27\% vs 0.17\%). Multiple logistic regression models
   adjusting for confounders, using Caucasian race/ethnicity as a
   reference, revealed a protective effect of black race/ethnicity for ARDS
   incidence (OR, 0.73; 95\% Cl, 0.58-0.91). Hispanics, but not blacks,
   experienced higher odds of adjusted ARDS-associated mortality (OR, 1.76;
   95\% Cl, 1.15-2.62) and ARDS case fatality (OR, 1,92:95\% Cl,
   1.17-3.09).
   Conclusions: Black race/ethnicity is not associated with ARDS mortality
   among blunt-trauma patients. Black race/ethnicity seems to have a
   protective effect in relation to ARDS incidence. Hispanic ethnicity was
   associated with a higher mortality and case fatality rates for ARDS.}},

   hyperactivity disorder was analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis.
   For both the home and school versions, a two-factor structure comprising
   items designed to measure inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity
   showed best fit to the data. A three-factor model splitting the
   hyperactivity and impulsivity items onto separate factors resulted in
   similar fit, but with a correlation between these two factors of .94 on
   both versions of the instrument. The two-factor structure is preferred,

Abstract = {{Background: Classical laparoscopic left colon resection requires a
   minilaparotomy. This wound can cause pain and morbidity. We describe our
   technique to avoid minilaparotomy by natural orifice specimen
   extraction.
   Methods: A four-port standard laparoscopic dissection for diverticular
   disease and small tumors of the left colon was performed. A silicon
   McCartney tube was transanally inserted into the rectum to remove the
   specimen and to pass the anvil of the circular stapler into the
   abdominal cavity. The head of the anvil was mechanically pretilted to
   facilitate introduction into the proximal colon. Double-stapled
   anastomosis was performed in the usual manner.
   Results: Eight patients with diverticular disease or small tumors were
   operated. There were no adverse events. Operating time ranged between 95
   and 180 minutes. For malignancies, tissue margins and lymphadenectomy
   were oncologically adequate. Four week follow-up was uneventful.
   Conclusion: The described natural orifice specimen extraction technique
   has the potential to avoid incision-related morbidity of the
   minilaparotomy in laparoscopic left colon resections.}},

Abstract = {{The pharmacodynamic effect of a 7-day oral treatment with a suspension
   of Coprinus comatus at doses of 0.835 and 1.670 g/kg in rats was
   studied. Changes in body weight, bile secretion and hypoglycaemic action
   were examined together with antipyretic activity and paw oedema tests.
   Such treatments resulted in a significantly lower increase in the body
   weight of tested animals (15.73 +/- 8.36 g/rat in the untreated group,
   8.44 +/- 8.23 g/rat (p < 0.05) and 3.18 +/- 7.93 g/rat (p < 0.05), for
   C. comatus 0.835 and 1.67 g/kg, respectively). Hypoglycaemic action was
   evident only in the glucose load test (6.79 +/- 0.61 to 9.70 +/- 1.16 (p
   < 0.05) in the untreated group and 6.47 +/- 0.35 to 7.27 +/- 0.76 for C.

   suggested certain protective functions of the mushroom suspension in
   alloxan poisoning. In the antipyretic test, a significantly lower
   increase in body temperature was observed in the mushroom-pretreated
   rats. In the paw oedema test, no decrease in oedema induced by formalin

   modify the properties and function of albumin molecules. In the present
   study, we used optical spectroscopic techniques to explore the binding
   sites of lead, present in albumin. Structural and chemical analysis of
   albumin molecules using fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy, predicted
   the modification of two major amino acids in albumin due to lead
   binding. No secondary structural changes are observed in the protein
   molecule, which is further confirmed using circular dichroism absorption
   measurements. The results indicate that loss of charge from the binding
   site of albumin by the charged lead ions, give rise to dipole
   interaction which acts as the major contributor to promote protein
   agglomeration.

Abstract = {{A subgrid-scale model pertaining to Large Eddy Simulation (LES) was
   developed by modifying the standard Smagorinsky model in order to take
   into account the inhomogeneities of the mean flow. According to this
   model, the magnitude of mean strain-rate is subtracted from the
   magnitude of the resolved strain-rate tensor for the calculation of
   eddy-viscosity. In this work, we perform large eddy simulation of
   turbulent channel flows at low and moderate Reynolds numbers. The
   predicted results compare well with the DNS data and results due to
   dynamic LES closure. The focus of this study has been on the assessment
   of capabilities of the model pertaining to the description of flow
   physics for the Reynolds numbers of interest. Also, the results are
   intended to establish the dominant effects of shear-length-scale near
   the wall. The simulations highlight other statistical features and
   turbulence characteristics too in order to broaden the applicability of
   the model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A modified degumming technique, involving boiling in 0.25\% Na(2)CO(3)
   with addition of 1\% sodium dodecyl sulphate and intermittent ultrasonic
   agitation, was developed for knitted silk scaffolds. Sericin was
   efficiently removed, while mechanical and structural properties of
   native silk fibroin were preserved. Biocompatible and mechanically
   robust hybrid nano-microscaffolds were fabricated by coating these
   degummed silk scaffolds with an intervening adhesive layer of silk
   solution followed by electrospun poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)
   nanofibers. Cell proliferation on the hybrid silk scaffolds was improved
   by seeding cells on both surfaces of the flat scaffolds. Rolling up and
   continued culture of the cell-seeded hybrid scaffolds yielded
   cylindrical constructs that permitted cell proliferation, extracellular
   matrix deposition, and generated ligament/tendon graft analogs. Although
   PLGA-based hybrid scaffolds have earlier been proposed for dense
   connective tissue engineering, rapid biodegradation of PLGA was a
   drawback. In contrast, the underlying strong and slowly-degrading
   microfibrous silk scaffold used in this study ensured that the hybrid
   scaffold maintained adequate mechanical properties for longer periods,
   which is vital for continued support to the injured ligament/tendon
   throughout its healing period. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Abstract = {{Background: Little is known about whether neuraminidase inhibitors are
   effective for children infected with oseltamivir-resistant influenza
   A(H1N1) viruses.
   Methods: Children aged 15 years and younger having influenza-like
   illness and who visited outpatient clinics within 48 hours of fever
   onset were enrolled from 2006-2007 to 2008-2009 influenza seasons in
   Japan. Patients received oseltamivir, zanamivir, or no treatment after
   screening by a rapid antigen test. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected
   before antiviral therapy and were used for virus isolation. Oseltamivir
   resistance was determined by detection of the H275Y mutation in
   neuraminidase, and susceptibility test using neuraminidase inhibition
   assay. Daily body temperature was evaluated according to drug type and
   susceptibility by univariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results: Of 1647 patients screened, 238 oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 cases
   (87 oseltamivir-treated, 64 zanamivir-treated, and 87 nontreated) and
   110 oseltamivir-susceptible cases (60 oseltamivir-treated and 50
   nontreated) were evaluated. In oseltamivir-resistant cases, fever on
   days 4 to 5 after the start of treatment was significantly higher in
   oseltamivir-treated and nontreated than in zanamivir-treated patients (P
   < 0.05). In oseltamivir-susceptible cases, fever was significantly lower
   in oseltamivir-treated than nontreated on days 3 to 6 (P < 0.01).
   Similar findings were obtained for duration of the fever and proportion
   of recurrent fever. Reduced effectiveness of oseltamivir was more
   prominent in children 0 to 6 years old than in those 7 to 15 years old.
   Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that lower age,
   nontreatment, and oseltamivir treatment of oseltamivir-resistant
   patients were factors associated with the duration of the longer fever.
   Conclusions: Infection with oseltamivir-resistant viruses significantly
   reduced the effectiveness of oseltamivir, and this tendency was more
   apparent in younger children.}},

Abstract = {{Objective We evaluated the partial volume effect in PET/CT images and
   developed a simple correction method to address this problem.
   Methods Six spheres and the background in the phantom were filled with
   F-18 and we thus obtained 4 different sphere-to-background (SB) ratios.
   Thirty-nine cervical lymph nodes in 7 patients with papillary thyroid
   carcinoma (15 malignant and 24 benign) were also examined as a
   preliminary clinical study. First, we developed recovery coefficient
   (RC) curves normalized to the maximum counts of the 37-mm sphere. Next,
   we developed a correction table to determine the true SB ratio using
   three parameters, including the maximum counts of both the sphere and
   background and the lesion diameter, by modifying the approximation
   formula of the RC curves including the point-spread function correction.
   The full width at half maximum in this formula is estimated with the
   function of the SB ratio.
   Results In the phantom study, a size-dependent underestimation of the
   radioactivity was observed. The degree of decline of RC was influenced
   by the SB ratio. In preliminary clinical examination, the difference in
   the SUV(max) between malignant and benign LNs thus became more prominent
   after the correction. The PV correction slightly improved the diagnostic
   accuracy from 95 to 100\%.
   Conclusions We developed a simple table lookup correction method for the
   partial volume effect of PET/CT. This new method is considered to be
   clinically useful for the diagnosis of cervical LN metastasis. Further
   examination with a greater number of subjects is required to corroborate
   its clinical usefulness.}},

   correct diagnosis was recalled by 6 patients. Two common interpretations
   of BMD test results emerged: (1) no news was considered to be good news
   (n = 9) and (2) evidence of compromised bone health was not considered
   to be serious or accurate (n = 6). Medication adherence did not appear
   to be associated with perception of bone health or actual BMD results.
   Patients' perceptions of their current bone health did not correspond to
   the results of their most recent BMD test. Standardized bone
   densitometry reporting may improve patients' understanding of their bone

Abstract = {{Combining ability analysis was conducted on 12 parental genotypes and
   their 27 F(1) hybrids to identify superior genotypes based on
   morpho-physiological traits in Basmati rice following line x tester
   mating design. Highly significant genetic variability was present among
   treatments, parents, parents vs. crosses, crosses, testers and line x
   tester interaction for flag leaf area, panicle density, harvest index,
   biological yield per plant and yield per plant. However, lines were
   significant for all the traits except flag leaf area and yield per
   plant. Preponderance of non-additive gene effects was realized by higher
   value of specific combining ability comparing to general combining
   ability, ratio of variance of general combining ability to variance of
   specific combining ability and degree of dominance. Four parental
   genotypes for grain yield per plant, 5 for flag leaf area, 4 for plant
   height, 5 for panicle density, 4 for harvest index and 3 for biological
   yield per plant were found good general combiners based on significant
   high mean performance and GCA effects. Seven hybrids for yield per
   plant, 4 for flag leaf area, 7 for plant height, 7 for panicle density,
   4 for harvest index and 3 for biological yield per plant excelled other
   hybrids in attaining high mean performance and SCA effects, hence these
   are recommended for heterosis breeding to improve yield and yield
   related traits. Based on SCA effects of the hybrids in relation to GCA
   effects of their parents, Kashmir Basmati x Basmati-385 is recommended
   for recombination breeding with early selection of desired plants
   whereas DM-107-4 x Basmati-385 and Super Basmati x Basmati-385 are
   proposed for recombination breeding with the condition of delayed
   selection of superior genotypes to develop potential varieties.}},

Abstract = {{Clavulanic acid (CA) is a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases. Oil can
   be used as a source of carbon and energy in CA production. To develop a
   policy for enhanced production of CA, the selection of a production
   medium and an optimum pH, different vegetable oils as carbon source have
   been used. The effects of different medium containing vegetable oil on
   cell growth and CA yield production during the fermentation of
   Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 were demonstrated. In this study,
   three out of eight tested oils supported CA production. Medium
   containing olive oil showed two-fold higher CA yield than glycerol
   containing medium. The highest productivity was obtained at initial pH
   7. We concluded that using olive oil as a sole source of carbon and
   energy for cultivation of S. clavuligerus is a promising strategy for CA
   production. It has several scientific advantages and economic benefits
   that lead to increased antibiotic titre and can be considered as a
   cheaper alternative compared to carbohydrates. The results of this study
   can be applied for the efficient production of alpha-lactamase
   inhibitory antibiotics.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) rely on various electroencephalography
   methodologies that allow the user to convey their desired control to the
   machine. Common approaches include the use of event-related potentials
   (ERPs) such as the P300 and modulation of the beta and mu rhythms. All
   of these methods have their benefits and drawbacks. In this paper, three
   different selective attention tasks were tested in conjunction with a
   P300-based protocol (i.e. the standard counting of target stimuli as
   well as the conduction of real and imaginary movements in sync with the
   target stimuli). The three tasks were performed by a total of 10
   participants, with the majority (7 out of 10) of the participants having
   never before participated in imaginary movement BCI experiments.
   Channels and methods used were optimized for the P300 ERP and no
   sensory-motor rhythms were explicitly used. The classifier used was a
   simple Fisher's linear discriminant. Results were encouraging, showing
   that on average the imaginary movement achieved a P300 versus No-P300
   classification accuracy of 84.53\%. In comparison, mental counting, the
   standard selective attention task used in previous studies, achieved
   78.9\% and real movement 90.3\%. Furthermore, multiple trial
   classification results were recorded and compared, with real movement
   reaching 99.5\% accuracy after four trials (12.8 s), imaginary movement
   reaching 99.5\% accuracy after five trials (16 s) and counting reaching
   98.2\% accuracy after ten trials (32 s).}},

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{829-840}},

Abstract = {{Medulloblastoma is an aggressive childhood cerebellar tumor. We recently
   reported a mouse model with conditional deletion of Patched1 gene that
   recapitulates many characteristics of the human medulloblastoma.
   Qualitative symptoms observed in the mouse model include irregular
   stride length, impaired cranial nerve function and decreased motor
   coordination and performance. In our current study, several quantitative
   behavioral assays including a mouse rotarod, a forced air challenge, a
   screen inversion test, a horizontal wire test, and stride length
   analysis were evaluated to determine the most sensitive and
   cost-effective functional assay for impaired neuromotor behavior
   associated with disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   was used to confirm and monitor tumor growth and as an anatomical
   biomarker for therapeutic response. Wild type mice or
   medulloblastoma-prone, conditional Patched1 knockout mice were observed
   by behavioral assays and MRI from postnatal weeks 3-6. Bortezomib
   treatment was administered during this period and therapeutic response
   was assessed using cerebellar volumes at the end of treatment. Of the
   behavioral tests assessed in this study, stride length analysis was best
   able to detect differences between tumor-prone mice and wild type mice
   as early as postnatal day 37 (P = 0.003). Significant differences
   between stride lengths of bortezomib treated and control tumor-bearing
   mice could be detected as early as postnatal day 42 (P = 0.020).
   Cerebellar volumes measured by MRI at the end of treatment validated the
   therapeutic effects seen by behavioral tests (P = 0.03). These findings
   suggest that stride length analysis may serve as one of the more
   sensitive and cost-effective method for assessing new therapeutic
   compounds in this and other preclinical model of brain tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Friction welding of dissimilar metal combination of aluminum alloy and
   austenitic stainless steel was examined to investigate the effect of
   welding conditions on mechanical properties of the dissimilar metal
   combination. The welded joints were produced by varying forge pressure
   (F (g)), friction pressure (F (r)), and burn-off length (B). The joints
   were subjected to mechanical testing methods such as the tension, notch
   Charpy impact tests. The tensile strength and toughness decrease with an
   increase in friction pressure. The tensile strength decreases with an
   increase in burn-off length at a low forge pressure while tensile
   strength increases with an increase in burn-off length at a high forge
   pressure. The tensile failure of the welded joint occurred in aluminum
   alloy just away from interface in the thermo-mechanically affected zone
   indicates good joint strength at the condition of low friction pressure,
   high forge pressure, and high burn-off length. The maximum tensile
   strength was observed with low friction pressure and high forge
   pressure. The tensile strength of dissimilar joint is approximately
   equal to tensile strength of 6063 aluminum alloys at the condition of
   low friction pressure, high forge pressure, and high burn-off length.
   The tensile and impact failure of joints was examined under scanning
   electron microscope and failure modes were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Human serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is known as an antioxidant and is also
   involved in the detoxification of many compounds. In this study, a novel
   purification strategy was employed to purify the PON1 by using
   cholesterol-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles. Magnetic nanoparticles
   were synthesized and conjugated with cholesterol through diazotized
   p-aminohippuric acid. In Fourier transform infrared spectrum of
   cholesterol-p-aminohippuric acid-Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the appearance of
   peaks at 3,358.3, 1,645 cm(-1), and at 2,334.9 cm(-1) confirmed the
   conjugation. The molecular weight of purified PON1 was nearly 45 kDa on
   sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE),
   and isoelectric point was 5.3. The specific activity was 438 U mg(-1)
   protein, and the purification fold was 515 with 73\% yield. The K (m)
   values were 1.3 and 0.74 mM with paraoxon and phenyl acetate,
   respectively. Western blot of 2D-PAGE confirmed the homogeneity and
   stability of the enzyme. Mg+2, Mn+2, glycerol, (NH4)(2)SO4, PEG 6000,
   Triton X-100, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride did not show any effect
   on activity. Pb+2, Co+2, Zn2+, ethanol, beta-mercaptoethanol, and
   acetone reduced the activity while Ni2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, iodoacetic acid,
   SDS, dimethylformamide, DMSO inhibited the activity. In vitro enzyme
   activity was slightly reduced by acetyl salicylic and acetaminophen and
   reduced 50\% with amino glycosides and ampicillin antibiotics at
   concentrations of 0.6 and 30 mg ml(-1), respectively. This is the first
   report for the synthesis of cholesterol-conjugated magnetic
   nanoparticles for simple purification of PON1 enzyme.}},

Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Pediatric aneuryms are rare and have characteristics that distinguish
   them from their adult counterparts. There is a greater capacity for
   pediatric aneurysms to arise de novo and progress rapidly.
   Saccular aneurysms are rarer; fusiform/giant aneurysms are more common.
   Hemorrhage is less common at presentation than are symptoms that result
   from mass effect. These patients also present with comorbidities that
   are unique to children and these conditions may influence treatment
   selection between minimally invasive procedures and microsurgery. Life
   expectancy is typically measured in decades for this population and thus
   treatment durability is of considerable importance.
   Our retrospective review indicated that complete aneurysm obliteration
   occurred in 93\% of microsurgery patients versus 79\% of endovascular
   patients. Although functional outcomes were similar for both treatment
   modalities, the need for additional treatment was over four times more
   likely in children receiving endovascular therapy.
   The need for continued follow-up cannot be overstated for this patient
   group, therefore, nor can the collaborative efforts of both surgeons and
   interventionalists to design the most appropriate treatment approach.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) over 40 years of age are
   often not offered treatment with hematopoietic cell transplantation
   (HCT) because of concerns about treatment-related morbidity or
   mortality. To evaluate this risk, we analyzed outcomes after allogeneic
   HCT from HLA-identical sibling donors for all older patients with SAA at
   our center since 1988. The 23 consecutive patients ranged in age from 40
   to 68 years. The conditioning regimen was cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg)
   and horse antithymocyte globulin. Methotrexate and cyclosporine were
   given for postgrafting immunosuppression. The cumulative incidences of
   grades II, III, and IV acute graft-versus-host-disease were 30\%, 4\%,
   and 0\%, respectively; that for chronic GVHD was 26\%. With a median
   follow-up of 9.1 years, overall survival was 65\%. Documented infections
   within 1 month before HCT were significantly associated with risk of
   early treatment-related mortality (P < .001). The median time to
   discontinuation of posttransplant immunosuppression was 6.2 (range:
   5.9-92.0) months. Three patients developed superficial basal cell
   carcinoma between 5.5 and 15 years after HCT. Our data favor a practice
   of extending HLA-identical sibling HCT for treatment of SAA in patients
   older than 40 years of age who are without significant medical

Abstract = {{This paper develops particle-resolved simulations to predict
   conductivity within porous composite electrodes. Hundreds of spherical
   particles (order fractions of a micron) are packed randomly into a
   cubical region (order of a few microns), using two alternative packing
   algorithms. The composite structures include both ion-conducting and
   electron-conducting particles. The particle network is discretized using
   tetrahedral meshes that fully resolve the interiors of the particles and
   their intersections. Charge-conservation equations are solved to predict
   current through the network. These simulations are used to derive the
   effective conductivities that are required for macroscale simulations at
   length scales much larger than the particle scale. Because the
   microstructures are synthesized via random particle packing, multiple
   realizations are needed to deliver statistically invariant results. The
   results show that a few hundred particles with a few hundred
   realizations is sufficient. Predicted coordination numbers, percolation
   probabilities, and three-phase-boundary lengths are consistent with
   percolation theory, but the predicted effective conductivities are
   significantly smaller than those predicted with conventional percolation
   theory. By adjusting the Bruggeman factor from the conventional value of
   1.5-3.5 brings the percolation-theory prediction for effective
   conductivity in line with the fully resolved results. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Bursts resulting from the chemical reaction between hydrochloric or

   delinquency in western countries because of its easiness of achievement
   A fast simple selective and cost effective method allowing the

   was thus required This article focused on the development and validation
   of a CE method using a BGE containing 2 6 pyridinedicarboxylic acid
   (PDC) acting as both an anionic chromophore and as an aluminum(III)
   complexing agent First the achievement of the speciation diagram of
   Al(III) in the presence of PDC allowed the choice of pH conditions for
   which aluminum(III) was globally anionic The study of the selectivity
   for Al(III) in the presence of ten other cationic species potentially
   present in post blast residues dictated the choice of the PDC
   concentration at 20 mM The validation step next demonstrated the figures
   of merit of the method with an intermediate precision for Al(III) of 2\%
   on normalized migration times and 3 5\% on corrected areas Finally this
   method was used for analyses of real post blast extracts from acid

Abstract = {{The bryophyte Mielichhoferia elongata is known to occur on copper-rich
   substrate, but the exact resistance level remained to be determined by
   in vitro experiments. Here, we tested its copper tolerance in graded
   copper solutions and compared the results to the moss Physcomitrella
   patens that is not known to inhabit heavy metal sites. Our results
   confirm the survival of M. elongata in classical resistance experiments
   of up to 10 mM Cu-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution.
   Interestingly, P. patens is equally resistant. Cultured on
   copper-enriched agar plates for over 5 weeks, P. patens survived even
   higher copper levels of up to 100 mM Cu-EDTA and an increment of growth
   was detected on all concentrations tested. Obviously, P. patens is able
   to withstand harmfully high levels of copper in both solution and
   substrate. In this short communication, we give a detailed description
   of the growth rates and discuss the results in comparison to other moss
   species and heavy metals.}},

Abstract = {{To study the effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective
   alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor agonist, on emergence agitation (EA), recovery
   profiles, and parents' satisfaction after sevoflurane anesthesia in
   pediatric ambulatory surgery.
   In a double-blind trial, 81 children (ASA PS 1 or 2, 1-9 years)
   undergoing same-day or overnight-stay surgery were randomly assigned to
   receive intravenous DEX 0.3 mu g kg(-1) (n = 39) or saline (n = 42) over
   10 min after induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced and
   maintained with sevoflurane using a facemask or laryngeal mask airway
   with spontaneous respiration. Agitation was assessed with a 1-4 point
   scale and pain with a 0-10 point scale. The patients' parents were
   interviewed 24 h after surgery, and adverse events and the parents'
   level of satisfaction with perioperative care were recorded.
   The incidence of EA (agitation scale score 3 or 4) was significantly
   lower in the DEX group (28\%) than in the saline group (64\%) (P =
   0.0011). The mean pain scales in the DEX group were significantly lower
   than in the saline group during the stay in the post-anesthesia care
   unit (PACU) (P < 0.01). The incidence of adverse events, times to the
   first drinking and voiding in the PACU, time spent in the PACU, and
   parents' satisfaction level were not different between the two groups.
   Intravenous DEX at a dose of 0.3 mu g kg(-1) after induction of
   anesthesia reduced sevoflurane-associated EA and postoperative pain in
   pediatric ambulatory surgery, with no increase in the incidence of
   adverse events and with no change in parents' satisfaction level.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Despite how common folds are as structural features, along-strike fold
   propagation has proven elusive to document. However, if a fold grows
   laterally along its axis, early-formed fold-related joints may differ
   significantly in orientation from joints that form later. In this paper,
   we integrate mechanical stratigraphy with joint pattern analysis to
   determine relative timing of jointing. Additionally, we demonstrate that
   joint patterns can be related to stresses on both the top and bottom of
   the bed during flexure.
   We present joint data from eight sedimentary beds on the fold terminus
   at Sheep Mountain Anticline, Wyoming, USA. The joint patterns around the
   terminus show two distinct patterns: joints in six of the beds show a
   radial pattern around the terminus whereas joint patterns in the two
   remaining beds differ from proximal units, despite being in the same
   structural position. Fracture resistance calculations confirm that the
   beds with mis-oriented fractures are less resistant to fracturing than
   other units in the study, and therefore would have fractured earlier in
   fold growth history. We present a plate bending model that illustrates
   potential joint patterns around a plunging fold nose from stresses along
   both the top and bottom of the bed. The joint strike predictions for the
   area in front of the inflection line on the fold nose match the
   orientations in our less resistant beds, which are now positioned behind
   the inflection line, suggesting that the fold grew laterally. The
   combined analysis of fracture pattern and mechanical stratigraphy
   provides a new way to investigate fold evolution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Background
   Gastro-esophageal reflux is considered a major culprit in the
   pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus (BE). Still, there is controversy on
   the role of weakly acidic and weakly alkaline reflux in BE. To compare
   characteristics of reflux episodes patients with BE, erosive esophagitis
   (EE), and healthy volunteers (HV).
   Methods
   One hundred consecutive patients with BE (75 short-segment BE, 25
   long-segment BE), 50 with EE and 48 HV underwent multichannel
   intraluminal impedance-pH off-therapy. We quantified esophageal acid
   exposure, characteristics, and proximal extension of reflux episodes.
   Key Results
   Total and acid reflux episodes gradually increased from HV {[}28
   (17.5-43) and 18 (8-31)] to EE {[}73.5 (54-96) and 52 (39-68)],
   short-segment BE (SSBE) {[}83 (73.2-131) and 65 (43.3-95)] and
   long-segment BE (LSBE) {[}105 (102-187) and 77 (75-107)]. Weakly acidic
   reflux episodes were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in LSBE {[}36
   (27.5-50.5)] and SSBE {[}34 (18.5-41)] compared to EE {[}21.5 (15-37)]
   and HV {[}19 (14-25)]. No differences in terms of proportion of acid,
   weakly acidic and weakly alkaline reflux were found {[}HV
   (49\%-49\%-2\%) vs EE (68\%-32\%-1\%) vs SSBE (65\%-34\%-1\%) vs LSBE
   (69\%-30\%-1\%); P = ns]. In LSBE, a higher percentage of reflux
   episodes (P < 0.05) reached the proximal esophagus (59\%) compared with
   SSBE (43\%).
   Conclusions \& Inferences
   Barrett esophagus patients have more severe reflux as shown by the
   number of acid and weakly acidic reflux episodes, re-reflux episodes and
   proximal migration. Given that PPI change only the pH of the refluxate,
   the role of weakly acidic reflux in Barrett's patients on acid
   suppressive therapy warrants further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{(137)Cs content in lichens and substrate (soil, bark) collected from W.
   Macedonia, Greece was measured 20 years after the Chernobyl reactor
   accident. Archive material from previous collections was also used for
   comparison and a diachronic estimation of the radio-contamination
   status. A gradual decrease was detected which depended on various
   factors such as the collected species, location, growth rate and
   substrate. Maximum accumulation capacity of (137)Cs was observed in
   epilithic lichens in comparison to epigeic or epiphytic ones.
   Furthermore, foliose or crustose lichens such as Parmelia sulcata,
   Xanthoria parietina, Xanthoria calcicola, Xanthoparmelia somloensis were
   more contaminated than filamentose at the same biotope. Among
   filamentose or fruticose species those with large surface area to
   biomass ratio e.g. Usnea sp. showed also greater accumulation capacity.
   Autoradiography revealed an amount of (137)Cs distributed more or less
   uniformly in lichen thalli. The high (137)Cs activities found in lichens
   20 years after Chernobyl suggest that these primitive plants are
   effective, suitable and inexpensive biological detectors of the
   distribution and burden of fallout radionuclide fallout pattern. (C)

Abstract = {{Corrosion in the overhead condensing system of atmospheric distillation
   units is a common occurrence in petroleum refineries worldwide. These
   corrosion problems are influenced by the presence of three phases:
   vapours, liquid hydrocarbons and aqueous phase containing hydrochloric
   acid formed during distillation by decomposition of chloride salts of
   calcium and magnesium.
   Present studies highlight the corrosion control of naphtha fractions of
   Bombay High and Dubai crude oils in laboratory distillation device by
   chemical treatment using various corrosion inhibitors having different
   functional groups. These studies were carried out using two phase
   systems (aqueous-hydrocarbon) in the distillation device having
   facilities for monitoring the corrosion and temperatures in vapour
   condensing region and liquid condensate. Corrosion monitoring was
   carried out by potentiodynamic polarization technique and dissolved iron
   analysis using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
   (ICPAES). Experimental findings indicate that Dubai naphtha fraction is
   more corrosive in nature when compared to Bombay High naphtha. This
   observation can also be explained on the basis of characterization of
   both crude oils and their naphtha fractions. At normally recommended
   dosage level as in refinery overhead systems, water soluble corrosion
   inhibitors are more effective than hydrocarbon soluble ones in the
   vapour condensing region as well as in the liquid condensate of both
   naphtha fractions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Pediatric patients with Crohn's disease often have low bone mass
   (osteopenia) for age. No randomized, placebo-controlled trials using
   zoledronic acid have ever been performed in this population. The
   objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of zoledronic acid in
   children with Crohn's disease and osteopenia.
   Methods:
   A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design was used. Thirteen
   adolescents received either a single intravenous dose of zoledronic acid
   (0.066 mg/kg, max 4 mg, n = 7) or saline placebo (n = 6). The primary
   outcome was change in lumbar spine bone mineral density (LSBMD) z-score
   at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included bone markers and adverse
   events.
   Results:
   At 6 months, the change in LSBMD z-score was significantly higher in the
   zoledronic acid group compared to placebo (0.7 vs 0.1, P < 0.001).
   Volumetrically adjusted LSBMD z-score also significantly increased in
   the treated group. This significant difference persisted until 12
   months. With zoledronic acid, urinary C-telopeptide excretion decreased
   by 50\% at 6 months and remained suppressed at 12 months (P = 0.02), but
   no changes were observed with placebo. Both groups had similar adverse
   events which included transient fever, arthralgias, and nausea (3/7
   treated, 2/6 placebo, P = NS).
   Conclusions:
   In this study, zoledronic acid demonstrated a significant increase in
   LSBMD at 6 and 12 months following a well-tolerated infusion.}},

Abstract = {{A Thomson scattering diagnostic designed to measure both edge and core
   physics has been implemented on MAST. The system uses eight Nd:YAG
   lasers, each with a repetition rate of 30 Hz. The relative and absolute
   timing of the lasers may be set arbitrarily to produce fast bursts of
   measurements to suit the time evolution of the physics being studied.
   The scattered light is collected at F/6 by a 100 kg six element lens
   system with an aperture stop of 290 mm. The collected light is then
   transferred to 130 polychromators by 130 independent fiber bundles. The
   data acquisition and processing are based on a distributed computer
   system of dual core processors embedded in 26 chassis. Each chassis is
   standalone and performs data acquisition and processing for five
   polychromators. This system allows data to be available quickly after
   the MAST shot and has potential for real-time operations.

Abstract = {{Because of the increasing incidence of worldwide obesity, cell culture
   models which enable the study of adipose tissue development are of
   particular importance. The murine embryonic stem cell (ESC) line CGR8
   differentiates into adipocytes with a differentiation efficiency of up
   to 15\%. A critical step for the analysis of stem cell-derived
   adipogenesis is the reliable separation of adipocytes. Here we report on
   how to (i) gently separate the cells of embryoid bodies (EBs) and (ii)
   identify and sort adipocytes from the rest of the heterogeneous cell
   mixture. Up to the present, no adipocyte specific surface marker is
   known for fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). After separation
   we employed two independently existing FACS methods for adipocyte cell
   sorting. These methods are based on Nile red staining and granularity.
   For stem cell-derived adipocytes only the combination of both methods
   led to a reliable, efficient, and highly reproducible FACS analysis, as
   shown by the presence and absence of adipocyte specific markers in
   positively and negatively sorted cells. (C) 2010 International Society

Abstract = {{P>1. In ectotherms, temperature and body size are the most influential
   and well studied variables affecting metabolic rate. Understanding
   mechanisms driving the evolution of metabolic rates is crucial to
   broader ecological theory. The metabolic cold adaptation hypothesis
   (MCA) makes predictions about the evolution of ectotherm metabolic rates
   and temperature-metabolic rate reaction norms.
   2. We examined intra and interspecific patterns in metabolic rate among
   populations in the Fundulus notatus species group (F. notatus, F.
   olivaceus and F. euryzonus). We ask if patterns of intra and
   interspecific variability in metabolic rate are consistent with the MCA
   and if metabolic rates in general are developmentally plastic.
   3. Support for the MCA was mixed among intra and interspecific tests.
   The northern population of F. olivaceus had increased metabolic rate and
   no difference in temperature sensitivity (slope of temperature-metabolic
   rate reaction norm). Northern populations of F. notatus had lower
   temperature sensitivity and no difference in overall metabolic rate. The
   southern coastal drainage endemic (F. euryzonus) had intermediate
   metabolic rates compared to southern populations of the other two more
   broadly distributed species. Metabolic rates were also developmentally
   plastic. Adults reared at warmer temperatures had lower metabolic rates
   after accounting for body size and temperature.
   4. Differences in thermal regimes explain some variability in metabolic
   rates among populations consistent with MCA. However, interspecific
   comparisons are not consistent with MCA and are likely influenced by
   species differences in ecology and life history strategies.}},

Title = {{A granular variant of CD63 is a regulator of repeated human mast cell
   degranulation}},
Journal = {{ALLERGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1242-1255}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{P>Background:
   Mast cells are secretory immune cells whose degranulation can provoke
   acute allergic reactions. It is presently unclear, however, whether an
   individual mast cell can repeatedly degranulate or turns dysfunctional
   after a single antigen stimulus. This work thus aims to better define
   the mast cell life cycle, with particular focus on new target structures
   for therapeutic or diagnostic approaches in allergy.
   Methods:
   Monoclonal antibodies were raised against degranulated cord
   blood-derived human mast cells. A subset of these antibodies that
   exclusively recognized degranulated mast cells, but did not cross-react
   with quiescent mast cells or other hematopoietic cell types, became key
   reagents in subsequent experiments.
   Results:
   We identified a granular variant of tetraspanin CD63 as an exclusive
   molecular marker of degranulated human mast cells. Mutant analyses
   indicate that a cysteine cluster around residue C170 and protein
   glycosylation at residue N172 account for the antibody specificity.
   Here, we show that mast cells, which underwent an initial Fc epsilon
   RI-mediated degranulation, can be degranulated for at least another
   cycle in vitro. Repeated degranulation, however, requires an IgE/antigen
   stimulus that differs from the preceding one. Furthermore, the new
   variant-specific anti-CD63 antibodies effectively impair repeated cycles
   of mast cell degranulation.
   Conclusion:
   Our findings indicate that mast cells are stable, multiple-use cells,
   which are capable of surviving and delivering several consecutive hits.
   Surface expression of the novel CD63 variant is a distinguishing feature
   of such primed cells. Reagents directed against this molecular hallmark
   may thus become valuable diagnostic and therapeutic agents.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, the Asia-Pacific region has experienced the
   most dynamic economic development of any of the world's regions, leading
   to a rapid increase in resource use and associated emissions. The region
   is now a major driver towards overshooting global resource use limits.
   In this paper, we provide an estimate of material use and resource
   efficiency in the Asia-Pacific region and its sub-regions for the first
   time, to complement existing knowledge on global resource use. We show
   that the Asia-Pacific has become the single largest user of resources
   globally, and that the efficiency of resource use in the region
   decreased over the period 1970-2005. Furthermore we show that the
   region's share of total resource use is now so significant that
   decreasing resource efficiency there has driven a decrease in overall
   global resource efficiency, for the first time in a century. Using an
   IPAT framework we found that rising per capita incomes contributed more
   strongly to growing material use than did population growth. Technology
   did not moderate material use growth to the extent expected. We argue
   that a failure to make these issues a central and immediate focus of
   public policy in the Asia-Pacific region would compromise
   competitiveness, resource security, and poverty reduction in the region
   over the medium to long term. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare the performance of partial ceramic crowns (PCCs)
   inserted with RelyX Unicem (RXU) either with (RXU+E) or without (RXU)
   selective enamel etching. Methods: 34 patients (15 male, 19 female)
   participated in the investigation, with a total of 68 PCC restorations.
   In each patient, one PCC was randomly assigned to insertion with RXU,
   the second PCC was assigned to insertion with RXU+E. The PCCs were
   CAD/CAM fabricated using the Cerec 3 system. RXU: 25 PCCs were placed in
   molars, nine in premolars. RXU+E: 26 PCCs were placed in molars, eight
   in premolars. The restorations were clinically rated using modified
   United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria at baseline, 6 and
   12 months after placement. The median patient age was 41 years (24-59
   years). The median (25-75\%) PBI was 6\% (3-9\%). Results: All patients
   were available for the three recall appointments. One PCC (RXU) debonded
   after 11 months in situ, one PCC (RXU+E) fractured after 12 months in
   situ. Both restorations had to be replaced. At the 12 months recall, 66
   of 68 controlled restorations were functional without need of
   replacement. The evaluation using USHPS criteria revealed a significant
   decrease of alfa ratings over time with respect to criteria marginal
   adaptation and marginal discoloration. No statistically significant
   differences between the two luting techniques, RXU and RXU+E, were
   observed during the observation period of 1 year. Within the limitations
   of the present study, adhesive luting with RXU with or without selective
   enamel etching can be recommended. (Am J Dent 2010;23:240-246).}},

Abstract = {{A decentralized model-based control strategy is designed to reduce
   low-frequency sound radiation from periodically stiffened panels. While
   decentralized control systems tend to be scalable, performance can be
   limited due to modeling error introduced by the unmodeled interaction
   between neighboring control units. Since bounds on modeling error are
   not known in advance, it is difficult to ensure the decentralized
   control system will be robust without making the controller overly
   conservative. Therefore an iterative approach is suggested, which
   utilizes frequency-shaped loop recovery. The approach accounts for
   modeling error introduced by neighboring control loops, requires no
   communication between subsystems, and is relatively simple. The control
   strategy is evaluated numerically using a model of a stiffened aluminum
   panel that is representative of the sidewall of an aircraft. Simulations
   demonstrate that the iterative approach can achieve significant
   reductions in radiated sound power from the stiffened panel without
   destabilizing neighboring control units. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {{Sequence stratigraphy has been applied in a wide range of scales of time
   and space, from decimeter-thick layers formed within hours to
   kilometer-thick basin fills formed during hundreds of millions of years.
   The traditional approach to practice sequence stratigraphy in this wide
   range of scales is to subdivide the sediment piles into an ordered
   hierarchy of sequence cycles of different duration and different
   architecture. An alternative are scale-invariant models with fractal
   characteristics. Published data confirm two predictions of the
   ordered-hierarchy model: sequences of very short duration (<1 x 10(3)
   years) are parasequences bounded by flooding surfaces, very long
   sequences (>200 x 10(6) years) are symmetrical transgressive- regressive
   cycles. However, the sequence record in the range of 1 x 10(4)-200 x
   10(6) years, the principal domain of sequence stratigraphy, shows a
   rather irregular succession of sequences with variable symmetry and
   bounded by flooding surfaces or exposure surfaces. For these time
   scales, scale-invariant models are a good first approximation,
   particularly because the evidence for scale-invariance and randomness in
   the stratigraphic record is strong: Frequency spectra of sea-level
   change as well as rates of sedimentation and rates of accommodation
   change plotted against length of observation span show basic trends
   indistinguishable from random walk. These trends, combined with
   scale-invariant sequence models may be the most efficient tools for
   across-the-board predictions on sequences and for locating islands of
   order in the sequence record.}},

Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Aim:
   Intrauterine conditions may interfere with foetal brain development. We
   compared the neurodevelopmental outcome between infants < 32 weeks
   gestational age after maternal preeclampsia or chorioamnionitis and
   controls.
   Methods:
   Case-control study on infants with maternal preeclampsia,
   chorioamnionitis and controls (each n = 33) matched for gestational age.
   Neurodevelopment at 2 years was assessed with the Bayley Scales of
   Infant Development II.
   Results:
   A total of 99 infants were included with a median gestational age of 29
   weeks (range 25-32). Median mental developmental index (MDI) was 96 in
   the control, 90 in the chorioamnionitis and 86 in the preeclampsia
   group. Preeclampsia infants had a lower MDI compared with the control
   group (univariate p = 0.021, multivariate p = 0.183) and with the
   chorioamnionitis group (univariate p = 0.242; multivariate p = 0.027).
   Median psychomotor index was 80.5 in the control, 80 in the preeclampsia
   and 85 in the chorioamnionitis group and was not different between these
   three groups (p > 0.05). Chorioamnionitis or preeclampsia exposure was
   not associated with major neurodevelopmental impairments (cerebral
   palsy, MDI < 70, PDI < 70).
   Conclusion:
   The results of this preliminary study suggest that preeclampsia and
   chorioamnionitis play a relatively minor role among risk factors for
   adverse neurodevelopment outcome. Postnatal factors such as ventilation
   and bronchopulmonary dysplasia may have a greater impact on
   neurodevelopmental outcome.}},

   define the potential influence of vasoactive factors in renal tissue

   Animals-10 purpose-bred 6-month-old sexually intact female cats.
   Procedures-10 cats underwent renal autotransplantation after 30 minutes
   In = 5) or 3 hours (5) of simple, ex vivo cold storage of renal
   autographs. Following autograft reperfusion, direct hemodynamic
   variables were measured with a telemetric implant and samples were
   collected for plasma renin concentration. Activation of vascular-related
   genes (renin, endothelin, and angiotensin converting enzyme) relative to
   2-hour simple cold or warm ischemia was also evaluated.
   Results-No significant difference between groups was detected in any of
   the hemodynamic variables or postreperfusion plasma renin concentrations
   measured in this study relative to the duration of cold ischemic
   storage. There was also no difference between warm- and cold-stored
   kidneys in the expression of vascular-related genes.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Prolonged renal ischemia for
   clinically relevant durations does not appear to predispose clinically
   normal cats to altered hemodynamics or high plasma renin concentrations
   following graft reperfusion. Activation of vasoactive genies does not
   appear to be influenced by type of ischemia over 2 hours. (Am J Vet Res

Abstract = {{In eukaryotic cells, the Rad6/Rad18-dependent monoubiquitination of the
   proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) plays an essential role in the
   switching between replication and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). The
   DNA polymerase Pol eta binds to PCNA via a consensus C-terminal
   PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) motif. It also specifically interacts
   with monoubiquitinated PCNA thanks to a recently identified
   ubiquitin-binding domain (UBZ). To investigate whether the TLS activity
   of Pol eta is always coupled to PCNA monoubiquitination, we monitor the
   ability of cell-free extracts to perform DNA synthesis across different
   types of lesions. We observe that a cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer
   (TT-CPD), but not a N-2-acetylaminofluorene-guanine (G-AAF) adduct, is
   efficiently bypassed in extracts from Rad18-deficient cells, thus
   demonstrating the existence of a Pol eta-dependent and Rad18-independent
   TLS pathway. In addition, by complementing Pol eta-deficient cells with
   PIP and UBZ mutants, we show that each of these domains contributes to
   Pol eta activity. The finding that the bypass of a CPD lesion in vitro
   does not require Ub-PCNA but nevertheless depends on the UBZ domain of
   Pol eta, reveals that this domain may play a novel role in the TLS
   process that is not related to the monoubiquitination status of PCNA.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: To assess the value of additional fine needle
   aspiration (FNA) to core needle biopsy (CNB) in computed
   tomography-guided biopsy of lesions of the lung, liver, pancreas, or of
   enlarged lymph nodes in an offsite cytopathologist setting.
   Materials and Methods: This retrospective Health Insurance Portability
   and Accountability Act-compliant study was approved by the Institutional
   Review Board (IRB); informed consent (IC) was waived. Data of 377
   patients who underwent computed tomography-guided FNA and CNB of lesions
   of the lung, liver, pancreas, or enlarged lymph nodes were enrolled. An
   onsite cytopathologist was not available. Sensitivity and specificity
   were calculated for FNA, CNB, and combined FNA/CNB. For the purpose of
   our study, positive diagnoses from CNB specimens or subsequent biopsy or
   surgical resection specimens or clinical follow-up data were considered
   as the standard of reference.
   Results: CNB yielded a significantly higher sensitivity than FNA in all
   sites, except the pancreas, where the difference did not reach
   statistical significance. Additional FNA to CNB did not significantly
   increase the sensitivity. Specificity did not significantly differ
   between FNA, CNB, and combined FNA/CNB in all sites. Malignancies of
   1.7\% were detected only with FNA, without evidence of malignancy in
   CNB; for the remaining malignancies, CNB was positive or indeterminate.
   Conclusion: Additional FNA to CNB without an onsite cytopathologist does
   not yield higher sensitivity or specificity compared to CNB alone.}},

Title = {{Do selected drugs increase the risk of lupus? A matched case-control
   study}},

Abstract = {{AIM
   To investigate the association between risk of lupus and exposure to
   selected drugs implicated in risk of lupus in a number of case reports.
   METHODS
   In this matched nested case-control study we utilized primary care data
   from the UK General Practice Research Database recorded between 1987 and
   2001. Cases with at least one medical code for systemic lupus
   erythematosus or drug-induced lupus in their computerized records were
   matched to controls without a medical code for lupus or any other
   autoimmune disorder. Using conditional logistic regression we computed
   odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for risk of lupus
   associated with exposure to selected drugs.
   RESULTS
   There were 875 incident cases, of which 12\% (n = 107) had evidence of a
   prescription for one or more of the suspected drugs, and 3632 matched
   controls. For some drugs, prescriptions were too uncommon to be able to
   estimate associated risk of lupus. Despite small numbers of exposed
   patients and low statistical precision we observed an increased risk of
   lupus for hydralazine (OR = 6.62, 95\% CI 1.03, 42.74), minocycline (OR
   = 4.23, 95\% CI 2.65, 6.75) and carbamazepine (OR = 1.88, 95\% CI 1.09,
   3.22). There was some indication that the effect of carbamazepine was
   restricted to women (P for interaction by gender = 0.047).
   CONCLUSION
   This study shows that even those drugs suggested by case reports as
   causing lupus cannot all be clearly shown to be associated, even in a
   very large population-based database. Our findings support causal
   relationships for carbamazepine, minocycline and possibly hydralazine.
   Overall, drugs do not seem to be a major cause of lupus.}},

   transition to environmental change in north-west Europe are critically
   re-examined in the light of accumulating palaeoenvironmental data, and a

   with declining marine productivity in the western Baltic, and the other
   with a proposed shift to drier, more continental conditions across
   north-west Europe. Both models are found to be unsatisfactory, although
   the case for southern Scandinavia seems to hold greater potential, at
   least for this region. Problems arise in the spatial scale over which
   climate change models are intended to apply, and over poor chronological
   resolution. Understanding the extent and nature of climate change at the
   relevant period, c. 6000/5800 cal. BP, is far from straightforward, as

Abstract = {{Platelets are essential corpuscular blood components required for
   hemostasis. They are released from precursor cells in the bone marrow by
   cellular fragmentation into the blood stream. Although some aspects of

   It first introduces current models of thrombopoiesis including open
   questions on cell biology. Second, it presents current findings on the
   release of megakaryocytes over the endothelial barrier into the blood
   stream where platelet production takes place outside the bone marrow.
   Finally, it reports on the translation of the more basic science into an
   improved understanding of novel parameters from automated blood counters
   surveying platelet volume (MPV), distribution width (PDW), mass (PCT)
   and the immature platelet fraction (IPF) into clinics where platelet
   counts are often the only accessible parameter to evaluate the risk of

Abstract = {{Sexual differentiation of the rodent brain occurs during a perinatal
   critical period when androgen production from the male testis is locally
   converted to estradiol in neurons, resulting in masculinization of adult
   sexual behavior. Adult brain responses to hormones are programmed
   developmentally by estradiol exposure, but the mechanism(s) by which
   these changes are permanently organized remains poorly understood.
   Activation of steroid receptors plays a major role in organization of
   the brain, and we hypothesized that estradiol-induced alteration of
   steroid-receptor gene methylation is a critical component to this
   process. Estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ER-beta and progesterone
   receptor are expressed at high levels within the preoptic area (POA) and
   the mediobasal hypothalamus, two brain regions critical for the
   expression of male and female sexual behavior. The percent methylation
   on the ER-alpha promoter increased markedly across development. During
   the critical period of sexual differentiation, females had significantly
   increased methylation than males or females masculinized with estradiol
   at two CpG sites. By adulthood, the neonatal sex difference and hormonal
   modulation of methylation were replaced with a new pattern at a
   different CpG site on the ER-alpha promoter. In contrast, the percent
   methylation on the progesterone receptor and ER-beta promoter did not
   change developmentally but was modulated by hormones and exhibited only
   late emerging transient sex differences. These data indicate that sex
   differences in the methylation pattern of genes important for sexual
   behavior are epigenetically modified during development, but the
   specific changes observed do not endure and are not necessarily
   temporally associated with neonatal hormone exposure. (Endocrinology

Abstract = {{In the 1990s, North Korea experienced one of the severest famines in

   in totalitarian states, substantial debate exists over how differently

   investigate regional differences in socioeconomic living conditions by
   comparing height-for-age z scores (HAZs) of 9934 preschool children
   living in 11 administrative provinces. Data are based on 2 UN/DPRK
   anthropometric surveys performed in North Korea representing cohorts
   born from 1991 to 2002. Through regression of pooled HAZs on a set of
   province dummies, the authors find that children born in Pyongyang are
   more healthy, providing evidence that elites residing in the capital
   seemingly possess comparative advantages in food supply. When
   controlling for further variables, they find that boys and older
   children suffered more during the crisis, although cohorts born before
   the onset of the famine were significantly better-off.}},

Abstract = {{A model has been developed to predict the kinetic rate constants

   electrophilicity index omega(q) {[}Wondrousch, D., et al. (2010) J.
   Phys. Chem. Lett. I, 1605-1610] at the beta-carbon atom as a descriptor
   of reactivity, a descriptor for resonance stabilization of the
   transition state, and one for steric hindrance at the reaction sites
   involved. Overall, the Michael addition model performs well (r(2) =
   0.91; rms = 0.34). It includes various classes of compounds with double
   and triple bonds, linear and cyclic systems, and compounds with and
   without substituents in the alpha-position. Comparison of experimental
   and predicted rate constants demonstrates even better performance of the
   model for individual classes of compounds (e.g., for aldehydes, r(2) =
   0.97 and rms = 0.15; for ketones, r(2) = 0.95 and rms = 0.35). The model
   also allows for the prediction of the RC50 values from the Schultz
   chemoassay, the accuracy being close to the interlaboratory experimental
   error. Furthermore, K-GSH and associated RC50 values can be predicted in
   cases where experimental measurements are not possible or restricted,
   for example, because of low solubility or high volatility. The model has
   the potential to provide information to assist in the assessment and
   categorization of toxicants and in the application of integrated testing

   methane steady state concentrations similar to Titan's atmospheric
   conditions. In our experiment, an initial similar to 5\% methane
   concentration is necessary to ensure a similar to 1.5\% methane steady
   state concentration in the plasma.
   The tholin mass production rate has been quantified as a function of the
   initial methane concentration. A maximum was found for a steady state
   CH4 concentration in agreement with Titan's atmospheric CH4
   concentrations. At this maximum, the tholin C/N ratio is about 1.45 and
   the carbon gas to solid conversion yield is about 35\%.
   We have modeled the mass production rate by a parabolic function,
   highlighting two competitive chemical regimes controlling the tholin
   production efficiency: an efficient growth process which is proportional
   to the methane consumption, and an inhibiting process which opposes the
   growth process and dominates it for initial methane concentrations
   higher than similar to 5\%. To explain these two opposite effects, we
   propose two mechanisms: one involving HCN patterns in the tholins for
   the growth process, and one involving the increasing amount of atomic
   hydrogen in the plasma as well as the increase in aliphatic
   contributions in the tholins for the inhibiting process. This study
   highlights new routes for understanding the chemical growth of the
   organic aerosols in Titan's atmosphere. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the dietary intake of antioxidant supplements
   could be a useful strategy to reduce the incidence of diseases
   associated with oxidative stress. The aim of present work is to study
   the possibility to obtain compounds with antioxidant activity from wine
   wastes using water as solvent. Results have shown that it is possible to
   obtain flavan-3-ol compounds from wine wastes both from V. vinifera (cv.
   Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) and V. labrusca (cv. Bordo and Isabella)
   species. The main phenolic compounds found in the extracts were catechin
   and epicatechin, followed by procyanidin B3, procyanidin B1, procyanidin
   B2, gallic acid, epigallocatechin, and procyanidin B4. All flavan-3-ol
   extracts showed significant in vitro and in vivo activities. It was
   found that the extracts were able to prevent lipid and protein oxidative
   damage in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus tissues of
   rats. Although further studies are necessary, these flavan-3-ol extracts
   show potential to be used to reduce the incidence of degenerative

Abstract = {{Object. The role of adenosine A(2A) receptors in the early vascular
   response after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is unknown. In other forms
   of cerebral ischemia both activation and inhibition of A(2A) receptors
   is reported to be beneficial. However, these studies mainly used
   pharmacological receptor modulation, and most of the agents available
   exhibit low specificity. The authors used adenosine A(2A) receptor
   knockout mice to study the role of A(2A) receptors in the early vascular
   response to SAH.
   Methods. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced in wild-type mice (C57BL/6)
   and A(2A) receptor knockout mice by endovascular puncture. Cerebral
   blood flow, intracranial pressure, and blood pressure were recorded, and
   cerebral perfusion pressure was deduced. Animals were sacrificed at 1,
   3, or 6 hours after SAH or sham surgery. Coronal brain sections were
   immunostained for Type IV collagen, the major protein of the basal
   lamina. The internal diameter of major cerebral arteries and the area
   fraction of Type IV collagen-positive microvessels (< 100 mu m) were
   determined.
   Results. The initial increase in intracranial pressure and decrease in
   cerebral perfusion pressure at SAH induction was similar in both types
   of mice, but cerebral blood flow decline was significantly smaller in
   A(2A) receptor knockout mice as compared with wild-type cohorts. The
   internal diameter of major cerebral vessels decreased progressively
   after SAH. The extent of diameter reduction was significantly less in
   A(2A) receptor knockout mice than in wild-type mice. Type IV collagen
   immunostaining decreased progressively after SAH. This decrease was
   significantly less in A(2A) receptor knockout mice than in wild-type
   mice.
   Conclusions. These results demonstrate that global inactivation of A(2A)
   receptors decreases the intensity of the early vascular response to SAH.
   Early inhibition of A(2A) receptors after SAH might reduce cerebral
   injury. (DOI: 10.3171/2009.9.JNS09802)}},

Abstract = {{This descriptive study examined factors associated with adolescent girls

   initiated, 80\% (264 of 334 girls 15-19 years old) returned after
   enrollment. Chi-square analyses found statistically significant
   differences (p < .001 to .05) between the girls who continued (n = 264)
   and those who did not (n = 68), associated with recruiter's experience,
   recruitment method, contact status, and parental awareness of study

Abstract = {{Numerous epidemiological studies have associated episodes of increased
   air pollution with increased incidence of respiratory disease, including
   pneumonia, croup, and bronchitis. Trichloroethylene (TCE) and chloroform
   are among 33 hazardous air pollutants identified by the U. S.
   Environmental Protection Agency as presenting the greatest threat to
   public health in the largest number of urban areas. Also, both are
   common indoor air pollutants. Here, we assessed the potential effects of
   TCE and chloroform on resistance to pulmonary bacterial infection and
   related alveolar macrophage (AM) function. CD 1 mice were exposed by
   inhalation to filtered air (control) or concentrations of TCE ranging
   from 5 to 200 ppm, or concentrations of chloroform ranging from 100 to
   2000 ppm. Immediately following exposure, mice were challenged with an
   aerosol of Streptococcus zooepidemicus and monitored for clearance of
   bacteria from the lung and mortality. In separate experiments, exposed
   mice were injected intratracheally with viable bacteria and phagocytic
   function was evaluated in macrophages obtained from lung washes 30 min
   later. The NOEL for enhanced mortality to infection was 25 ppm for TCE
   and 500 ppm for chloroform. Relative to the air controls, differences in
   clearance of bacteria from the lung were noted in mice exposed to TCE
   (NOEL = 50 ppm) and to chloroform (NOEL 100 ppm), and differences in AM
   phagocytic index were noted for TCE (NOEL = 100 ppm) and for chloroform
   (NOEL < 100 ppm). The data support the utility of the S. zooepidemicus
   infectivity model in assessing potential increased risk of respiratory
   infection and suggest that delayed clearance of bacteria from the lung
   or decreased phagocytosis are viable alternatives to mortality as an
   endpoint. Collectively, these endpoints are among the most sensitive
   health effects reported for TCE.}},

Abstract = {{Of all the organs of the human body, the skin is most commonly affected
   by malignancy, and ultraviolet radiation has long been implicated as the
   primary mutagenic exposure leading to the development of many cutaneous
   cancers. However, as research in this field has continued, it has become
   clear that the effect of ultraviolet radiation on the skin is quite
   complex. Distinct cell types within the skin exhibit differing responses
   to ultraviolet radiation, and even within the same cell type, divergent
   effects may be observed; depending on the dose or wavelength of the
   radiation, or the maturational state of the affected cell, unique
   responses can be elicited. Melanocytes form a minor component of the
   outermost layer of skin, but they have an enormous impact on not only
   the appearance of the skin, but also the ability of the skin to
   withstand exposure to ultraviolet radiation. In addition, melanocytes
   give rise to melanoma, one of the most deadly types of skin cancer.
   Clearly, it is critical that we achieve a better understanding of the
   effect of ultraviolet radiation on melanocytes, and that we clarify its
   role in the oncogenesis of melanoma. Although the picture is far from
   complete, the mechanisms by which melanocytes respond to ultraviolet
   radiation are beginning to be elucidated, and, as these pathways emerge,
   they offer new targets for chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial quality of some
   minimally processed vegetables. A total of 345 samples of minimally
   processed vegetables were acquired at a department store, a local
   supermarket, and a restaurant in Seoul, Korea. Samples were tested for
   microorganism distributions and for the presence of pathogenic bacteria.
   The aerobic mesophilic counts ranged between 2.0 and 9.7 log CFU/g, with
   the highest count recorded from the sprouts. Counts of psychrotrophic
   microorganisms were as high as those of the mesophilic microorganisms.
   Total coliform populations between 1.0 and 8.8 log CFU/g were found in
   98.3\% of the samples. Microbiological counts for fresh-cut fruits were
   very low. Sprouts were highly contaminated with microorganisms and
   showed a high incidence of Escherichia coli and Clostridium
   perfringence. Salmonella species and Listeria monocytogenes were
   detected in 1.5 and 0.3\% of samples, respectively. E. coli O157:H7 and

Abstract = {{Background. Tumor stage may relate to the chronology of neoplasm growth
   and has been used as an outcome variable when studying diagnostic delay
   in oral cancer. However, tumor growth rate may act as a confounding
   factor.
   Methods. We reviewed a total of 63 incident cases of oral cancer. The
   variables considered for the study included age, sex, smoking history,
   tumor site, TNM stage, Ki-67 score, and diagnostic delay.
   Results. Significant differences between survivors and exitus were found
   in terms of tumor stage at diagnosis (I-II vs III-IV), sex, and Ki-67
   scores. When the analysis was adjusted for tumor stage at diagnosis
   (I-II vs III-IV), proliferative activity resulted to be an independent
   prognostic factor for survival, whereas diagnostic delay did not
   influence survival.
   Conclusion. These results seem to suggest that survival from oral cancer
   is affected more by the biology of the cancer (rapid tumor growth) than
   by diagnostic delay. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 32:

Abstract = {{Novel applications and injection sites for Botox are continually
   evolving. This study aimed to analyze Botox outcomes for various
   injection sites to differentiate treatments that consistently yield
   impressive results from those that produce less patient satisfaction.
   The change in the prevalence of Botox usage for each facial subsite over
   a 2-year period also was evaluated.
   A retrospective chart review was performed for 60 patients who received
   Botox injections in a private cosmetic surgery practice. Patients were
   sampled from 24-month periods 2 years apart. The information collected
   included dosing and injection intervals and patterns. The outcomes
   analyzed included the prevalence of injections by subsite and the
   retention rate.
   The most frequently injected subsite was the glabellar region. The
   findings showed an impressive trend toward increasing numbers of
   patients receiving treatment of the superolateral orbicularis oculi
   (57-80\%) and the depressor anguli oris (10-20\%).
   Botox injection for facial rejuvenation has an excellent track record
   for patient satisfaction. The prevalence of treatment for the
   traditional injection sites was very stable over the measured period.
   The study findings support the use of Botox in certain more recently
   described regions such as the superolateral orbicularis oculi and the
   depressor anguli oris.}},

Abstract = {{We use Global Positioning System (GPS) velocities and dislocation
   modeling to investigate the rate and nature of interseismic strain
   accumulation in the area affected by the 1908 Mw 7.1 Messina earthquake
   (southern Italy) within the framework of the complex central
   Mediterranean microplate kinematics. Our data confirm a change in the
   velocity trends between Sicily and Calabria, moving horn NNW-ward to
   NE-ward with respect to Eurasia. and detail a fan-like pattern across
   the Messina Straits where maximum extensional strain rates are -65
   nanostrains/yr. Extension normal to the coast of northern Sicily is
   consistent with the presence of SW-NE trending normal faults. Half-space
   dislocation models of the GPS velocities are used to infer the
   slip-rates and geometric fault parameters of the fault zone that
   ruptured in the Messina earthquake. The inversion, and the bootstrap
   analysis of model uncertainties, finds optimal values of 3.5(+2 0)(-1 3)
   and 1.63(+0.3)(-0.2) mm/yr for the dip-slip and strike-slip components,
   respectively, along a 30(+1) (-0 7)(1)degrees SE-ward dipping normal
   fault, locked above 7.6(+4 6)(-2 9) km depth. By developing a regional
   elastic block model that accounts for both crustal block rotations and
   strain loading or block-bounding faults, and adopting two different
   competing models for the lonian-Calabria convergence rates, we show that
   the measured velocity gradient across the Messina Straits may be
   significantly affected by the elastic strain contribution from other
   nearby faults. In particular, when considering the contribution of the
   possibly locked Calabrian subduction interface onto the observed
   velocity gradients in NE-Sicily and western Calabria, we find that this
   longer wavelength signal can be presently super-imposed on the observed
   velocity gradients in NE-Sicily and Calabria. The inferred slip-rate on
   the Messina Fault is significantly impacted by elastic strain from the
   subduction thrust. By varying the locking of the subduction thrust
   fault, in fact, the Messina Fault slip-rate varies from 0 to 9 mm/yr.

Abstract = {{A new tangential two-dimensional soft x-ray imaging system (SXRIS) is
   being designed to examine the edge island structure in the lower X-point
   region of DIII-D. Plasma shielding and/or amplification of the
   calculated vacuum islands may play a role in the suppression of
   edge-localized modes via resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs). The
   SXRIS is intended to improve the understanding of three-dimensional (3D)
   phenomena associated with RMPs. This system utilizes a tangential view
   with a pinhole imaging system and spectral filtering with beryllium
   foils. SXR emission is chosen to avoid line radiation and allows
   suitable signal at the top of a H-mode pedestal where T(e) similar to
   1-2 keV. A synthetic diagnostic calculation based on 3D SXR emissivity
   estimates is used to help assess signal levels and resolution of the
   design. A signal-to-noise ratio of 10 at 1 cm resolution is expected for
   the perturbed signals, which are sufficient to resolve most of the
   predicted vacuum island sizes. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Concentrations of elements (As, Co, Cu, Ni, Mo, Pb, V, and Zn) are
   studied in the sediments of two adjacent stretches of Chenar Rahdar
   river. The first stretch (S1) is influenced by urban and arable land
   wastewater, and the second (S2) is mainly loaded with industrial
   effluents. The average abundance order of heavy metals content in S1
   sediments is Ni > V > Zn > Cu > Co > As > Pb > Mo and in S2 sediments is
   Ni > Zn > V > Cu > Mo > Pb > Co > As. The maximum average concentration
   for these heavy metals (except for As) occurs in the S2 sediments. The
   contamination factor (CF) base of background in S1 for eight analyzed
   elements is moderate. The CF for Cu, Zn, and Pb in S2 sediments is
   considerable. The highest CF in S1 and S2 sediments is observed for Mo
   (CF = 10.95 and 12.41) and indicates very high contamination. The
   application of modified degree of contamination values (mC(d)) indicates
   low and high degree of contamination (1.89-4.15) in S1 and S2,
   respectively. Calculated enrichment factors (EF) reveal enrichment of Mo
   and As in S1 and Zn, Cu, Mo, and Pb in S2 compared to the average
   abundances of background level. The maximum EF for Mo is 7.61
   (significant enrichment), while Pb, Zn, and Cu with maximum EF between 2
   and 5 indicate moderate contamination. Principal component analysis
   (PCA) shows distinctly different elemental associations in S1 and S2
   sediments. The strong association of Zn, Co, Ni, Sc, Cu, Al and Fe in S1
   suggests a similar source. The results of PCA for Zn, Pb, Mo and Cu in
   S2 (componente2) indicate that these metals are influenced by
   anthropogenic activity. Also, high loading heavy metals with OC (0.97)
   indicate that organic carbon plays a significant role in the
   distribution and sorption of these heavy metals in the sediments. Factor
   analysis indicates that As and Mo behave differently in sediment
   samples.}},

   Different kinds of biological systems have been used for this purpose.

   Tetraselmis suecica as a reducing agent of HAuCl, (chloroauric acid)
   solution. The UV-visible spectrum of the aqueous medium containing AuNPs
   indicated a peak at 530 nm, corresponding to the surface plasmon
   absorbance of AuNPs. The X-ray diffraction pattern also showed a Bragg
   reflection related to AuNPs. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was
   performed for analysis of surface functional groups of AuNPs.
   Transmission electron microscopy and particle-size-distribution patterns
   determined by the laser-light-scattering method confirmed the formation
   of well-dispersed AuNPs. The most frequent size of particles was 79 nm.}},

Abstract = {{There is a heterogeneous group of noninfectious gastroenterocolitis
   syndromes that are characterized by immune dysregulation. Recent
   advances in pathologic analysis have allowed for better characterization
   of many of these disorders. Some entities demonstrate characteristic
   disease distribution, epidemiologic features, natural history, and
   response to specific therapy. For instance, celiac disease occurs in
   genetically susceptible individuals who are sensitive to gluten,
   eosinophilic esophagitis is an immune response to ingested allergens,
   and microscopic colitis predominantly occurs in older patients with
   chronic diarrhea and is induced or exacerbated by drugs. Eosinophilic
   gastroenteritis has a variety of clinical and imaging manifestations.
   Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are multifactorial immune-mediated
   chronic inflammatory disorders and have become increasingly prevalent in
   recent years. Multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance
   imaging provide valuable information that may be used to diagnose these
   conditions, guide treatment, and assess changes after treatment, and the
   role of imaging in evaluating response to therapy continues to evolve
   and expand. (C) RSNA, 2010 . radiographics.rsna.org}},

Abstract = {{Amphotericin B (AmB) is a poorly water soluble antibiotic and is used to
   treat fungal infections of the central nervous system (CNS). However,
   AmB shows poor penetration into the CNS. Angiopep-2, the ligand of
   low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) present on the
   BBB, exhibits higher transcytosis capacity and parenchymal accumulation,
   which allowed us to consider the selectivity of it for receptor-mediated
   drug targeting to the brain. With this in mind, we prepared angiopep-2
   modified PE-PEG based micellar drug delivery system loaded with the
   antifungal drug AmB to evaluate the efficiency of AmB accumulating into
   the brain. PE-PEG based micelles as nano-scaled drug carriers were
   investigated by incorporating AmB with high drug entrapping efficiency,
   improving solubilization of AmB and reducing its toxicity to mammalian
   cells. The AmB-incorporated angiopep-2 modified micelles showed highest
   efficiency in penetrating across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) than
   unmodified micelles and Fungizone (deoxycholate amphotericin B) in vitro
   and in vivo. Meanwhile, contrary to the free Rho 123, the enhancement of
   Rho 123-incorporated angiopep-2 modified micelles across the BBB can be
   explained by angiopep-2 modified polymeric micelles that have a
   potential to overcome the activity of efflux proteins expressed on the
   BBB such as P-glycoprotein. In conclusion, angiopep-2 modified polymeric
   micelles could be developed as a novel drug delivery system for brain
   targeting. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave induced copolymerization of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and
   chitosan (Ch) resulted in copolymer Ch-g-beta-CD synthesized without any
   radical initiator or catalyst. Copolymer samples of different
   performances in terms of Pb(II) binding were synthesized by changing
   beta-CD concentration at fixed microwave power and exposure time. To
   understand the advantage of using microwaves in the adsorbent synthesis,
   the copolymer synthesized using a K2S2O8/ascorbic acid redox pair at
   identical beta-CD and Chitosan concentrations (\% G 103) was also
   evaluated as Pb(II) sorbent, and the results obtained were compared with
   that of microwave synthesized copolymer. A representative sample of
   microwave synthesized adsorbent was characterized using FTIR
   spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, TGA, SEM analysis and using this sample
   adsorption of lead (II) was studied as a function of pH, initial Pb(II)
   concentration. The adsorption data followed both Freundlich and Langmuir
   isotherms. On the basis of the Langmuir model, Q(max) was calculated to
   be 434.78 mg/g for microwave synthesized copolymer (Ch-g-beta-CD) in
   comparison to 294.11 mg/g for conventionally synthesized copolymer
   (Ch-g-beta-CD). In order to investigate dynamic behaviour of
   Ch-g-beta-CD as an adsorbent, the kinetic data were modelled using
   pseudo-second-order and second-order. The regeneration experiments
   revealed that the Ch-g-beta-CD can be successfully reused for seven
   cycles. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the aggregation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the
   presence of N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was studied
   by monitoring turbidity as a function of time. BSA-CTAB aggregation
   exhibits an exponential growth, with a pronounced lag phase and a
   subsequent rapid growth of the aggregates. On the addition of sugars and
   polyols to BSA-CTAB solution, there is an increase in the lag time and
   decrease in the rate constant of growth phase indicating that the
   inhibitors affect both the pre- and post-nucleation processes. The
   concentration dependence studies of lag time of BSA-CTAB aggregation in
   the presence of additives points towards the involvement of more number
   of monomers in the nucleus/start aggregate. The increase in the
   stability of BSA in the presence of these additives indicates probable
   role of activation energy in the aggregation. However, the temperature
   dependence of lag time of BSA-CTAB aggregation shows that the hindrance
   to molecular collisions, as indicated by decrease in the pre-exponential
   factor, due to increased viscosity in the presence of additives is the
   main factor responsible for their inhibitory action. Similarly, higher
   viscosity of sucrose makes it a much better inhibitor of the heat and
   surfactant induced aggregation of BSA-CTAB than mannitol. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective. To investigate pregnancy and labour outcomes in grand and
   great grand multiparous women.
   Study design. A retrospective population-based study was conducted
   between the years 1988 and 2007. Parturients were classified into three
   groups: multiparous; 2-5 deliveries, grand multiparous; 6-9 deliveries,
   and great grand multiparous; 10+ deliveries. Stratified analyses
   included multiple logistic regression models.
   Results. A significant linear association was found between parity and
   adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes such as malpresentation, labour
   dystocia, caesarean delivery, postpartum haemorrhage, maternal anaemia
   (HB<10), congenital malformations and perinatal mortality. Using
   multivariable logistic regression models, grand multiparity was found an
   independent risk factor for labour dystocia, first stage (OR=1.5,
   P<0.001), and perinatal mortality (OR=2.0, P<0.001). Great grand
   multiparity was found an independent risk factor for labour dystocia,
   first stage (OR=2.6, P<0.001), labour dystocia, second stage (OR=2.1,
   P<0.001), and perinatal mortality (OR=2.5, P<0.001).
   Conclusion. Women with high birth order are at increased risk for
   adverse obstetric outcomes. The risk is higher for great grand
   multiparous women compared to grand multiparous women. Grand and great
   grand multiparity are independent risk factors for labour dystocia and
   perinatal mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the quality pertaining to the various structural
   components and aspects of research articles published in Iranian
   journals of dentistry in the first six months of the year 2006.
   Methodology: This descriptive study assessed the quality of 100 original
   articles published in Iranian Journals of dentistry in terms of their
   various structural components including abstracts, introductions,
   methodology, results, discussions and references. Based on 52 variables
   the articles were classified into three categories of ``adequate{''},
   ``relatively adequate{''} and ``inadequate{''}. Data analysis was done
   using Chi-square statistical test.
   Results: The mean number of authors for each article was 2.9 +/- 0.84.
   Failure rate to report the ``reliability{''} of the instrument of
   measurement was 96\%, followed by failure to justify the sample size
   (93\%). Justification for publication was not reported in 73\% of the
   articles and 87\% didn't cite the limitations and valuable findings of
   the study. No statistically significant association was found between
   the quality of published articles and study designs, number of authors
   and references (P<0.3).
   Conclusion: Significant quality related issues of concern were observed
   in articles published in Iranian dental journals. Attention to and
   rectification of these, by authors, reviewers and editors will improve
   the quality of future publications.}},

Title = {{INDUCTION OF PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH IN ARABIDOPSIS AND RICE BY
   SINGLE-WALL CARBON NANOTUBES}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study : Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have many
   unique structural and mechanical properties. Their potential
   applications, especially in biomedical engineering and medical
   chemistry, have been increasing in recent years, but the toxicological
   impact of nanoparticles has rarely been studied in plants.
   Methods : We exposed Arabidopsis and rice leaf protoplasts to SWCNTs and
   examined cell viability, DNA damage, reactive oxygen species generation,
   and related gene expression. We also tested the effects of nanoparticles
   on Arabidopsis leaves after injecting a SWCNT solution. EM-TUNEL
   (electron-microscopic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
   dUTP nick end-labeling) and a cerium chloride staining method were used.
   Key results : SWCNTs caused adverse cellular responses including cell
   aggregation, chromatin condensation along with a TUNEL-positive
   reaction, plasma membrane deposition, and H2O2 accumulation. The effect
   of SWCNTs on the survival of cells was dose dependent, with 25 mu g/mL
   inducing 25\% cell death in 6 h. In contrast, activated carbon, which is
   not a nanosized carbon particle, did not induce cell death even 24 h
   after treatments. The data indicated that the nano-size of the particle
   is a critical factor for toxicity. Moreover, endocytosis-like structures
   with cerium chloride deposits formed after SWCNT treatment, suggesting a
   possible pathway for nanoparticles to traverse the cell membrane.
   Conclusions : Consequently, SWCNTs have an adverse effect on protoplasts
   and leaves through oxidative stress, leading to a certain amount of
   programmed cell death. Although nanomaterials have great advantages in
   many respects, the benefits and side effects still need to be assessed
   carefully.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass, one of the most important renewable energies, is playing and
   will continue to play an important role in the future energy structure
   of the world. This article aims to analyze the position and role, assess
   the resource availability, discuss the geographic distribution, market
   scale and industry development, and present the policy options of
   biomass in China. The resource availability and geographical
   distribution of biomass byproducts are assessed in terms of crop
   residues, manure, forest and wood biomass byproducts, municipal waste
   and wastewater. The position of biomass use for power generation is just
   next to hydropower among types of renewable energy in China. The
   potential quantity of all biomass byproducts energy in 2004 is 3511 Mtce
   (Mtce is the abbreviation of million tons of coal equivalents and 1 Mtce
   is equal to10(6) tce.), while the acquirable quantity is 460 Mtce.
   Biomass energy plays a critical role in rural regions of China. The
   geographical distribution and quantity of biomass byproducts resources
   depends mainly on the relationship between ecological zones and climate
   conditions. Our estimation shows that the total quantity of crop
   residues, manure, forest and wood biomass byproducts, municipal waste
   and wastewater resources are 728, 3926, 2175, 155 and 48240 Mt (million
   tons), respectively. Crop residues come mainly from the provinces of
   Henan, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Sichuan. All manure is mainly
   located in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei and Hunan.
   Forest and wood biomass byproducts are mainly produced in the provinces
   or autonomous regions of Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, Heilongjiang and Inner
   Mongolia, while most of municipal waste mainly comes from Guangdong,
   Shandong, Heilongjiang, Hubei and Jiangsu. Most of wastewater is largely
   discharged from advanced provinces like Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang,
   Shandong and Henan. Biomass byproducts' energy distribution also varies
   from province to province in China. Based on the analysis of the market
   scale and industry development, the article argues that China's biomass
   energy industry is still at a very early stage of development and that
   Feed-in Tariffs (FIT) might be the best policy option for China to
   promote its development of biomass energy. A successful enforcement of
   FIT in China needs some policy combination of special capital subsidies,
   R\&D funding, tax incentives and pricing.}},

   undergraduate health science degree. Most reflective practice
   publications are focused on medical or teachers' training rather than
   undergraduates in general. This is surprising given that reflective
   practice is an impetus to deeper learning. The students were required to
   write a 500 word reflective piece after writing essays on the disease
   model and a public health approach to problem gambling, substance use,
   tobacco use, or eating disorders. This innovative study demonstrated
   that reflective practice can help the students learn on a deeper level
   both academically and personally. In particular, reflective practice
   should become compulsory for graduates entering the health sectors as
   they will cross paths with those suffering from addictions. Themes
   emerging from the reflective writing were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We studied electrostatic charging on amorphous ice films induced by the
   impact of 100 key Ar(+) ions at 45 degrees incidence. We derived the
   positive surface electrostatic potential from the kinetic energy of
   sputtered molecular ions. Measurements were performed as a function of
   film thickness, ion flux and accumulated fluence. The main results are
   (a) films charge up to a saturation value, following an exponential time
   dependence. (b) The time constant for charging is approximately
   proportional to the reciprocal of the ion flux. (c) The maximum surface
   voltage depends on film thickness and ion flux. (d) Charging does not
   occur for films thinner than the maximum range of projectile. (e)
   Dielectric breakdown is observed for surface potentials above similar to
   100 V. We explain the measurements with a model in which charges can
   drift into the substrate or be trapped temporarily near the ionization
   range of the projectiles. A charge can be released from the trap by the
   electric field produced by a nearby charge injected by subsequent
   projectiles. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dihydroxy aromatics in coal tar undergo rapid coupling reactions with
   each other and with some coal-derived species during coal pyrolysis and
   liquefaction. However, only limited information on the structure of
   dihydroxy aromatics is known. In this study. Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to characterize the
   dihydroxy aromatics in a low-temperature pyrolyzed coal tar and its
   distillate and residue fractions. Negative-ion electrospray ionization
   (ESI) FT-ICR MS spectra of coal-tar-derived samples had low molecular
   masses and narrow mass ranges. Negative-ion ESI is extremely selective
   for the dihydroxy aromatics present in coal tar. The O-2 class species
   had the highest ion intensity among the species in the negative-ion
   FT-ICR mass spectrum for each sample. Dihydroxy compounds with an
   aromatic core structure of benzene, indan. biphenyl (and/or
   acenaphthene), and naphthalene were identified in the distillate
   fractions. Dihydroxy compounds in the residue fraction were dihydroxy
   fluorenes and phenanthrenes (and/or anthracenes). The O-2 class species
   with relatively high molecular masses were likely dihydroxy
   acenaphthylenes and/or hydroxy dibenzofurans but could not be
   distinguished from each other because these compounds have the same
   molecular mass.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: VEGF and BMP play important roles in angiogenesis and
   osteogenesis. Combining these two factors may be a promising therapeutic
   strategy for avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH).
   Methods: Rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were
   isolated and purified by density gradient centrifugation combined with
   attachment culture methods. The purity and characteristics of the BMSCs
   were detected by cell surface antigen identification. The best MOI of
   BMSCs transfected with rAAV was detected by fluorescent cell counting,
   and cell viability was determined by MU assay. Expression of the genes
   of interest was detected by GFP gene expression, RT-PCR assay, and ELISA
   assay. The biological activities of VEGF and BMP were detected by
   angiogenic and osteogenic assays.
   Results: The best MOI of BMSCs transfected with rAAV was 5 x 10(4)
   v.g./cell. Cell growth curves showed vigorous cell viability.
   Expressions of the GFP, VEGF(165), and BMP, genes were detected 1 day
   post-transfection and peaked 14 days post-transfection. Expression of
   the genes of interest was sustained over 1 month. VEGF and BMP proteins
   secreted from BMSCs transfected with rAAV-hVEGF(165)-IRES-hBMP(7)
   enhanced angiogenesis and osteogenesis in vitro.
   Conclusion: Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors co-expressing the
   hVEGF(165) and hBMP(7) genes showed efficient gene expression ability.
   The VEGF(165) and BMP7 proteins expressed from the vector have efficient
   biological activity in vitro. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We used time-series sediment trap data for four major components,
   organic matter and ballast minerals (CaCO3, opal, and lithogenic matter)
   from 150, 540, and 1000 m in the western subarctic Pacific (WSAP), where
   opal is the predominant mineral in sinking particles, to develop four
   simple models for settling particles, including the ``ballast model{''}.
   The ballast model is based on the concept that most of the organic
   matter ``rain{''} in the deep sea is carried by the minerals. These four
   models are designed to simultaneously reproduce the flux of each major
   component of settling particles at 540 and 1000 m by using the data for
   each component at 150 m as initial values. Among the four models, the
   ballast model, which considers the sinking velocity increase with depth,
   was identified as the best using the Akaike information criterion as a
   measure of the model fit to data. This model successfully reproduced the
   flux of organic matter at 540 and 1000 m, indicating that the ballast
   model concept works well in the shallow zone of the WSAP on a seasonal
   timescale. This also suggests that ballast minerals not only physically
   protect the organic matter from degradation during the settling process
   but also enhance the sinking velocity and reduce the degree of
   decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{The cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) has emerged as an important
   experimental animal model for biomedical research in various domains,
   necessitating the more extensive characterization of the genetic
   backgrounds influencing the macaque's response to drugs and sensitivity
   to experimental disease. The diversity of the variable mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) D-loop region has been analyzed phylogenetically among
   geographically isolated populations or within subdivisions of the same
   regional population. However, the genetic differences among several
   substructures originating from a common population have not yet been
   investigated. By sequencing fragments of the mtDNA D-loop region from
   two subpopulations from the Indochinese region (Cambodian-Chinese and
   Vietnamese) along with two native Indonesian and Filipino populations,
   we identified 87 mtDNA D-loop haplotypes, of which 67 are new. The
   phylogenetic relationship suggests that the Indochinese haplotypes are
   intermingled in comparison to the distinct divergence of the Indonesian
   and Filipino lineages. The subpopulations were shown by estimation of
   evolutionary divergence and Wright's F-statistic (Fst) to have little
   genetic differentiation. Altogether, the subpopulations may be used in
   biomedical research, even though a slight difference is observed in
   haplotype frequencies among them. Therefore, genetic diversity analyses
   will be necessary for the elucidation of genetic differences among the
   populations, as well as to obtain a better understanding of genetic
   diversity for biomedical research. This will involve the selection of
   macaques and the monitoring of genetic heterogeneity among and within
   breeding facilities.}},

Title = {{Coproduction in successful software development projects}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Context: Coproduction of new products has been deemed successful in
   organizational partnerships by adding to the quality and scope of the
   product. Techniques that involve users during the development of
   software tend to mimic this environment, but differ in the type of
   product and internal client roles. The question is thus, whether
   coproduction improves the outcomes of a software development project as
   it has in other disciplines.
   Objective: This paper evaluates how the coproduction relationship
   between software developers and users improves the outcomes of a
   development project. Coproduction is believed to improve outcomes when
   available knowledge is accessible and applicable to the objective of the
   development project. Should the relationships hold, coproduction
   approaches to development can be approached with confidence and
   improvements made by attention to the development and deployment of
   expertise.
   Method: A quantitative questionnaire related to the coproduction
   environment was developed for four variables to include coproduction,
   applying expertise, locating expertise, and project success. 128 users
   from development teams responded to the survey and represent a variety
   of industries, individual characteristics, and project sizes.
   Results: Expertise is crucial to the success of a software development
   project and coproduction improves the ability to access and apply the
   needed expertise. In addition, coproduction directly improves outcomes.
   Conclusion: Coproduction can be an effective approach to the development
   of systems in terms of meeting project goals. Additionally, the assembly
   of expertise on the team is an important contributor to successful
   outcomes that may be enhanced through effective selection of team
   members. The ability to locate the available expertise is crucial,
   indicating the value of team building functions to promote awareness of
   expertise location. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate dinoflagellate cysts as indicators of salinity or
   eutrophication and to document the historical occurrence of ellipsoidal
   Alexandrium cysts in the Korean coastal areas we studied a sediment core
   from Yeoja Bay The analyzed dinoflagellate cysts Include over 30 taxa
   commonly reported from other temperate regions Cluster analysis based on
   dinoflagellate cyst assemblages indicated two main time intervals from
   the mid-1990s to 2006 (Zone II) and from the early 1900s to early 1990s
   (Zone I) The total cyst concentration Increased sharply in Zone IT to
   reach approximately five times the level in Zone I The salinity in Yeoja
   Bay increased after 1995 (from 28 to 31 psu) possibly due to a stronger
   intrusion of the Tsushima Warm Current The increase in salinity
   coincided with increases in the abundance of Brigantedinium spp and
   Selenopemphix nephroides In addition ellipsoidal Alexandrium cysts have
   occurred since the 1980s and increased in abundance since the mid-1990s
   when a paralytic shellfish poisoning outbreak and increases in
   ellipsoidal Alexandrium cysts were recorded in several Korean and
   Japanese coastal areas This suggests that ellipsoidal Alexandrium cysts
   may have been carried to the Korean coast, including Yeoja Bay by the
   current system possibly the Tsushima Warm Current, and that the current
   system may influence the growth of Alexandrium cysts (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Melatonin has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of malignant and
   transformed human prostate epithelial cells by transcriptional
   up-regulation of p27Kip1 expression via MTNR1A receptor-mediated
   activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) in
   parallel. Given that melatonin MTNR1A receptor is a G protein-coupled
   receptor, this study was conducted to identify the specific G proteins
   that mediate the antiproliferative action of melatonin on human prostate
   epithelial cells. In 22Rv1 and RWPE-1 cells, knockdown of either G
   alpha(s) or G alpha(q), but not G alpha(i2) expression by RNA
   interference, abrogated the effects of melatonin on p27Kip1 and cell
   proliferation. Conversely, cellular overexpression of activated mutants
   of G alpha(s) and G alpha(q) in 22Rv1 and RWPE-1 cells mimicked the
   effects of melatonin on prostate epithelial cell antiproliferation by
   increasing p27Kip1 expression through downstream activation of PKA and
   PKC in parallel. Moreover, melatonin or 2-iodomelatonin induced
   elevation of adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in 22Rv1 and
   RWPE-1 cells. The effects of 2-iodomelatonin on cAMP were blocked by the
   nonselective MTNR1A/MTNR1B receptor antagonist luzindole but were not
   affected by the selective MTNR1B receptor antagonist
   4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetraline (4-P-PDOT). Furthermore, knockdown of G
   alpha(s) mitigated the stimulatory effects of 2-iodomelatonin on cAMP.
   Collectively, the data demonstrated, for the first time, functional
   coupling of MTNR1A receptor to G alpha(s) in cancerous or transformed
   human cells expressing endogenous melatonin receptors. Our results also
   showed that dual activation of G alpha(s) and G alpha(q) proteins is
   involved in the signal transduction of MTNR1A receptor-mediated
   antiproliferative action of melatonin on human prostate epithelial

Abstract = {{Background and Aims:
   Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is commonly used to detect liver
   damage. Recent studies indicate that ALT levels at the upper range of
   normal limits are predictors of adverse outcomes, especially diabetes
   mellitus (DM) and the metabolic syndrome. The aim of our study was to
   define the ALT threshold for both men and women that may predict the
   onset of DM.
   Methods:
   We analyzed a large Health Maintenance Organization cohort of 157 308
   healthy subjects with no evidence of liver disease and with baseline ALT
   levels < 120 U/L, and identified those who developed DM within 6 years.
   Results:
   Overall, an elevated baseline serum ALT value was significantly
   associated with the development of DM, with an odds ratio of 3.3 when
   comparing the higher and the lower quartiles of the whole study
   population. A subgroup analysis revealed that baseline ALT values higher
   than 10 U/L among women and 22 U/L among men were already significantly
   associated with an increased risk for DM for any increment in ALT level.
   Notably, ALT values higher than similar to 55 U/L were associated with
   increased risk for DM that was relatively constant for any increment in
   ALT. Higher baseline ALT levels were stronger predictors for DM as
   compared with age, triglycerides and cholesterol levels.
   Conclusion:
   Our study implies that ALT values higher than 10 U/L and 22 U/L for
   women and men, respectively, may predict DM. We suggest redefining ALT
   values as either `normal' or `healthy', with the later reflecting much
   lower values, above which an individual is at increased risk for DM.}},

Title = {{A new method for estimating carbon dioxide emissions from transportation
   at fine spatial scales}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Detailed estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at fine spatial
   scales are useful to both modelers and decision makers who are faced
   with the problem of global warming and climate change. Globally,
   transport related emissions of carbon dioxide are growing. This letter
   presents a new method based on the volume-preserving principle in the
   areal interpolation literature to disaggregate transportation-related
   CO2 emission estimates from the county-level scale to a 1 km(2) grid
   scale. The proposed volume-preserving interpolation (VPI) method,
   together with the distance-decay principle, were used to derive emission
   weights for each grid based on its proximity to highways, roads,
   railroads, waterways, and airports. The total CO2 emission value summed
   from the grids within a county is made to be equal to the original
   county-level estimate, thus enforcing the volume-preserving property.
   The method was applied to downscale the transportation-related CO2
   emission values by county (i.e. parish) for the state of Louisiana into
   1 km(2) grids. The results reveal a more realistic spatial pattern of
   CO2 emission from transportation, which can be used to identify the
   emission `hot spots'. Of the four highest transportation-related CO2
   emission hotspots in Louisiana, high-emission grids literally covered
   the entire East Baton Rouge Parish and Orleans Parish, whereas CO2
   emission in Jefferson Parish (New Orleans suburb) and Caddo Parish (city
   of Shreveport) were more unevenly distributed. We argue that the new
   method is sound in principle, flexible in practice, and the resultant
   estimates are more accurate than previous gridding approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-The age-adjusted stroke death rate in adults aged
   >= 45 years is significantly higher in the Northwest region than in the
   rest of the United States. Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and
   Washington have substantial rural and frontier areas with unique
   characteristics and complexities that pose challenges to timely acute
   stroke care and ultimately affect the patient.
   Methods-A regional needs assessment was conducted to assess acute stroke
   care capacity and services in the Northwest region. Hospitals with an
   emergency department were surveyed with a standardized online tool based
   on the Brain Attack Coalition recommendations and developed by stroke
   neurologists, emergency medical services leaders, state public health
   professionals, and American Stroke Association members.
   Results-Approximately 76\% of hospitals completed the questionnaire.
   Striking rural-urban differences were seen with rural hospitals having a
   much lower capacity to adequately care for patients with stroke. Two
   thirds lacked the necessary personnel, one third lacked necessary
   neuroimaging equipment, and one fourth were functioning without written
   emergency department and tissue plasminogen activator stroke protocols.
   Conclusions-This survey represents the first comprehensive regional
   assessment of stroke care capacity and services both in the Northwest
   region and the whole United States. The findings have confirmed the need
   to focus on strengthening stroke personnel, increasing access to care,
   and promoting written protocols, especially in rural settings.
   Additionally, promoting stroke center certification, increasing the
   number of stroke registries throughout the region, encouraging use of
   inpatient stroke care protocols in rural hospitals, and conducting
   ongoing stroke care capacity and services surveys is highly recommended.

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore the usefulness of ``anhedonia{''}, ``fatigue{''}
   and ``depressed mood{''} as screening symptoms for predicting a
   depressive episode in physically ill patients.
   Method: 290 patients filled in a modified version of the Patient
   Questionnaire and were subsequently assessed by psychiatrists with the
   Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI; ICD-10 version).
   Results: 63 patients suffered from a current depressive episode
   according to the CIDI. If at least two of the three symptoms were used
   for screening positively (ICD-10 algorithm), the sensitivity was 93.2\%
   and the specificity 72.7\%, while the simpler algorithm of DSM-IV -
   requiring depressed mood or anhedonia to be present - yielded a slightly
   higher sensitivity (95.2\%) and a slightly lower specificity (66.5\%).
   One in five patients with a depressive episode did not report
   ``depressed mood{''}.
   Limitation: It remains unclear how relevant the three core symptoms of
   depression are for the diagnosis of an ICD-10 depression in people who
   are not physically ill.
   Conclusion: The fact that both diagnostic algorithms yielded comparable
   results suggests that the more parsimonious DSM-IV algorithm is
   preferable and ``fatigue{''} could be left out as a screening symptom.
   Since ``depressed mood{''} was absent in a substantial proportion of
   patients, special attention has to be paid to ``anhedonia{''}. Medical
   students and non-psychiatric clinicians should be especially trained to
   ask for anhedonia, so that cases of depression will not be overlooked.

Abstract = {{Air pollution is a major contributor to several respiratory problems, it
   affects the whole population in general but children are more
   susceptible. Exposure to automobile exhaust is associated with increased
   respiratory symptoms and may impair lung function in children. In view
   of this, the study was conducted among the children of Delhi, the
   capital city of India, where ambient air quality was much above the
   National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The study was conducted in
   children aged 9-17 years. Pulmonary function test was carried out
   following the guideline of American Thoracic Society using a portable,
   electronic spirometer. Air quality data was collected from Central and
   State Pollution Control Boards. In addition, the level of particulate
   matter in indoor air was measured by portable laser photometer. Lung
   function was reduced in 43.5\% schoolchildren of the urban area compared
   with 25.7\% of control group. The urban children had increased
   prevalence of restrictive, obstructive, as well as combined type of lung
   functions deficits. Besides higher prevalence, the magnitude of lung
   function deficits was also much more in them. After controlling
   potential confounders like season, socioeconomic conditions and ETS,
   PM10 level in ambient air was found to be associated with restrictive
   (OR = 1.35, 95\% CI 1.07-1.58), obstructive (OR = 1.45, 95\% CI
   1.16-1.82), and combined type of lung function deficits (OR = 1.74, 95\%
   CI 1.37-2.71) in children. Spearman's rank correlation test reaffirmed
   the association. The study confirms that the level of air pollution is
   affecting the children.}},

   cognitive function and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in mice, and
   whether apolipoprotein E isoform modulates these effects. Mice
   expressing human apolipoprotein E3 or E4 were exposed to methamphetamine
   (5 mg/kg) or saline once a day from postnatal days 11-20 and

Abstract = {{Economic research on the determinants of gender differences in economic

   Extending these investigations to other outcomes such as wealth up till

   German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) we find a significant `raw' gender
   wealth gap of 50,000euro for married partners. Decomposition analyses
   reveal that the gap is largely driven by differences in characteristics
   between men and women (observables), particularly by individual's own
   income and labour market experience. This is especially true at the
   bottom and at the top of the wealth distribution, which we show using
   semi-parametric decomposition techniques. Differences in the lower half
   of the distribution are mostly driven by the wealth function, i.e., the
   way in which women transform their characteristics into wealth.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. We report the clinical, radiological and pathological
   features of a spinal pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, an unusual
   neoplastic entity in a really rare location, establish an appropriated
   management of these lesions and review the short available english
   literature.
   Case report. A 60 years old woman consulted with doctor because she felt
   progressive clumsiness accompanied by occasional paresthesias on her
   left hand. Neurological examination showed up weakness and slight
   propioceptive disturbances. The differential imagine diagnosis was
   established between intramedullary astrocytoma and ependimoma. Patient
   underwent surgical gross total remove. Histopathological examination
   confirmed the diagnosis of pleomorfic xanthoastrocytoma. We performed
   MRI controls at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months that did not reveal recurrence.
   Nowadays, the patient has regained her previous quality of life.
   Discussion and conclusion. Comparing to published cases about
   intracranial pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, spinal pleomorphic
   xanthoastrocytomas (SPXA) present different epidemiological
   characteristics. The known SPXAs affected to cervical and/or high
   thoracic levels. The hypothesis about a more ggressive behaviour of PXA
   in spinal cord may be corroborated after literature review. Extension
   examination is mandatory since dissemination along the neuroaxis has
   been described. Removal extension is crucial in the prevention of tumour
   recurrence. Adyuvant radiotherapy should only be considered when there
   is postoperative residual tumour and/or anaplastic features. Randomized
   clinical trials or databases are necessary to know all the aspects of
   this pathological entity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To prospectively validate the Parent and Adolescent Medication
   Barriers Scales (PMBS and AMBS) for assessing perceived barriers to
   medication adherence in adolescent transplant recipients by examining
   the relations of perceived barriers to medication adherence and clinical
   outcomes at 18-month follow-up. Methods Of the 82 adolescent recipients
   enrolled in the initial cohort, 66 families participated in the
   follow-up. Relations among barriers, adherence, and clinical outcomes
   were examined. Results Reported barriers demonstrated temporal stability
   over an extended span of time. Adolescent-perceived barriers of Disease
   Frustration/Adolescent Issues and parent-perceived barriers of Regimen
   Adaptation/Cognitive Issues were associated with poorer adherence to
   medication taking at follow-up. Interestingly, medical complications and
   mortality were significantly associated with both parent and
   adolescent-perceived ingestion issues barriers. Conclusions Barriers to
   adherence are essential to address in an effort to ameliorate adherence
   difficulties and potentially reduce the incidence of medical
   complications.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prevention strategies in atopic dermatitis (AD) using
   allergen avoidance have not been consistently effective. New research
   reveals the importance of the skin barrier in the development of AD and
   possibly food allergy and asthma. Correcting skin barrier defects from
   birth may prevent AD onset or moderate disease severity.
   Objective: We sought to determine the feasibility of skin barrier
   protection as a novel AD prevention strategy.
   Methods: We enrolled 22 neonates at high risk for developing AD in a
   feasibility pilot study using emollient therapy from birth.
   Results: No intervention-related adverse events occurred in our cohort
   followed up for a mean time of 547 days. Of the 20 subjects who remained
   in the study, 3 (15.0\%) developed AD, suggesting a protective effect
   when compared with historical controls. Skin barrier measurements
   remained within ranges seen in normal-appearing skin.
   Limitations: No conclusions regarding efficacy can be made without a
   control group.
   Conclusions: Skin barrier repair from birth represents a novel and
   feasible approach to AD prevention. Further studies are warranted to
   determine the efficacy of this approach. (J Am Acad Dermatol

   The hR(F) values of these cephalosporins were investigated on silica gel
   G-zinc ferrocyanide layers. Mixing of zinc ferrocyanide with silica gel
   G resulted in a decrease in hR(F) values, removal of tailing and better
   resolutions. The influence of silica gel G-zinc ferrocyanide ratio and
   mobile phases on the chromatographic behavior of cephalosporins on thin
   layers was investigated. Cephalosporins were selectively separated in
   their binary and ternary synthetic mixtures and pharmaceutical

   Long-term monitoring work includes the measurements of temperature
   (inside and outside house), relative humidity (inside and outside house)
   and illumination level (inside and outside house) for 25 days in all the
   seasons (January: winter, April: spring/pre-summer.july: summer/monsoon
   and October: autumn/pre-winter) of the year 2008. Temperatures profile
   across all the seasons represents strong daily and seasonal
   fluctuations. Formulae have been developed based on part of the
   monitoring data to predict the indoor maximum, average and minimum
   temperatures inside the same house occupied by the same family. The
   predicted formulae were developed based on the measured data for the
   month of January and July and were validated with the measured data of
   April and October months. It is found that the correlation coefficient

Abstract = {{Background: Portal hypertension in the mucosa of the intestine and the
   presence of granulomas in the wall of this organ can alter digestive
   function in patients with schistosomiasis. Citrulline is a potential
   marker of intestinal function in some diseases that affect the
   morphometry of the mucosa because of its close association with
   enterocytes. The aims of the present study were to determine serum
   citrulline concentrations in mice with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis,
   analyze the morphologic repercussions for the mucosa of the small
   intestine, correlate citrulline concentrations with morphometric changes
   in the intestinal mucosa, and evaluate the effect of splenectomy on
   citrulline concentration.
   Methods: After approval from the local ethics committee, 46 adult female
   albino Swiss mice were divided into two groups: Control (23 healthy
   mice) and experimental (23 mice with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis).
   Blood samples were collected for the analysis of plasma citrulline
   before and after splenectomy. A segment of the jejunum was resected for
   morphometric analysis.
   Results: The average body mass in the control group was greater than
   that in the experimental group (p = 0.00062). The average citrulline
   concentration in the control group was greater than that in the
   experimental group both before and after splenectomy (p <0.001). In the
   experimental group, the villi had less height and area, and there was a
   smaller perimeter of the mucosal surface (p = 0.003, <0.001, and p =
   0.001, respectively). There was a direct correlation between citrulline
   concentration and the height and area of the villi (p = 0.003 and 0.04,
   respectively). There was no correlation between citrulline concentration
   and the perimeter of the surface of the jejunal mucosa. After
   splenectomy, there was a reduction in the mean citrulline concentration
   in the experimental group (p = 0.009).
   Conclusions: Serum citrulline concentrations were reduced in mice with
   schistosomiasis, and a direct correlation was found between the
   citrulline concentration and the morphometry of the jejunal villi.
   Moreover, there was a reduction in the plasma concentration of
   citrulline after splenectomy.}},

Abstract = {{Information on oxygen permeability through polymer films is essential
   for some applications, especially in food packaging where the control of
   oxygen levels can be critical in avoiding food spoilage. A permeability
   testing device using fluorescence-based optical oxygen sensing was
   developed as a potential new instrument for measuring the oxygen
   permeability of packaging films. The fluorescence-based permeability
   tester was validated against two existing commercial oxygen permeability
   measuring devices, the Mocon Ox-Tran 2/20 and PBI-Dansensor OPT-5000.
   Oxygen transmission rates (OTR) of polylactide (PLA) and
   nanoclay-reinforced PLA films, as well as polyethylene/poly(ethylene
   terephthalate) (PE/PET) and polypropylene/poly(ethylene terephthalate)
   (PP/PET) laminated films were determined at 23 degrees C and 50\%
   relative humidity using each of these instruments. No significant
   differences were observed between mean OTR values obtained by the
   fluorescence method and the corresponding values obtained using the
   OPT-5000 but significantly lower values were measured when using the
   Mocon Ox-Tran 2/20. In general, oxygen permeability data for the tested
   films were within the range of values found in the literature; however,
   in terms of further development, the fluorescence-based technique gave
   OTR with relatively high standard deviation compared to the commercial
   methods and equipment modifications to address this issue are considered
   desirable. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for the simultaneous measurement of the effective ionic
   conductivity and effective electronic conductivity in a porous sheet
   consisting of an electronic conductor and an ionic conductor
   (electrolyte) is proposed. In this method, two potentiostats and a
   voltage source are used, and these instruments are connected to the
   sample via two terminals made of the electronic conductor and two
   terminals made of the ionic conductor. The underlying principle of this
   technique does not include any assumption about charge-transfer
   resistance at the ionic conductor/electronic conductor interface, since
   the measurement is designed to let the potential difference at the
   interface be the OCP value at each point throughout the sample. The
   validity of this method was confirmed by measuring a pseudo-catalyst
   layer for a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The results
   revealed that the effective ionic and electronic conductivity depends on
   the relative humidity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an attempt was made to mathematically model and predict
   algal blooms in Tolo Harbor (Hong Kong) using genetic programming (GP).
   Chlorophyll plays a vital role in blooms and was used in this model as a
   measure of algal bloom biomass, and eight other variables were used as
   input for its prediction. It has been observed that GP evolves multiple
   models with almost the same values of errors-of-measure. Previous
   studies on GP modeling have primarily focused on comparing GP results
   with actual values. In contrast, in this study, the main aim was to
   propose a systematic procedure for identifying the most appropriate GP
   model from a list of feasible models (with similar error-of-measure)
   using a physical understanding of the process aided by data
   interpretation. Evaluation of the GP-evolved equations shows that they
   correctly identify the ecologically significant variables. Analysis of
   the final GP-evolved mathematical model indicates that, of the eight
   variables assumed to affect algal blooms, the most significant effects
   are due to chlorophyll, total inorganic nitrogen and dissolved oxygen
   for a 1-week prediction. For longer lead predictions (biweekly),
   secchi-disc depth and temperature appear to be significant variables, in
   addition to chlorophyll. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are a group of lipid mediators synthesized in
   response to a number of physiological and pathological stimuli. Because
   of the low tissue concentrations of NAEs, analyses often include liquid
   extraction followed by solid-phase extraction and subsequent
   quantitation by LC/MS or GC/MS. Reported levels of NAEs vary
   considerably, however, and often no explanation is given for these
   discrepancies. Brought on by difficulties encountered during method
   development, the effects of using four different brands of
   silica-containing solid phase extraction (SPE) columns and five
   different brands of chloroform for sample preparation were investigated.
   Considerable variation in the retention and recoveries of seven NAEs and
   2-arachidonoylglycerol existed between the SPE columns. Furthermore, it
   was found that some chloroforms contained quantifiable amounts of
   N-palmitoylethanolamine and N-stearoylethanolamine. Finally, it was
   found that use of one of the chloroforms resulted in a loss of
   N-oleoylethanolamine from solution due to addition of chlorine to the
   omega-9 bond. The identity of this reaction product was confirmed by
   LC-MS/MS and NMR. It is recommended that these aspects of sample
   preparation and analysis should be thoroughly validated during method
   development and the relevant information on specific brands used be
   reported in future communications in order to better estimate the
   validity of reported quantitative data.-Skonberg, C., A. Artmann, C.

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: The goals were (1) to describe and to characterize pediatric
   clinical research networks (PCRNs) in the United States and Canada, (2)
   to identify PCRN strengths and weaknesses, (3) to evaluate the potential
   for collaboration among PCRNs, and (4) to assess untapped potential
   interest in PCRN participation.
   METHODS: Data collection included (1) initial identification of PCRNs
   through an Internet search and word of mouth, (2) follow-up surveys of
   PCRN leaders, (3) telephone interviews with 21 PCRN leaders, and (4) a
   survey of 43 American Academy of Pediatrics specialty leaders regarding
   untapped interest in network research.
   RESULTS: Seventy exclusively pediatric networks were identified. Of
   those, specialty care networks constituted the largest proportion
   (50\%), followed by primary care (28.6\%) and disease-specific (21.4\%)
   networks. A network profile survey (response rate: 74.3\%) revealed that
   similar to 90\% held infrastructure funding. Nearly 75\% of respondents
   viewed cross-network collaborations positively. In-depth telephone
   interviews corroborated the survey data, with cross-network
   collaboration mentioned consistently as a theme. American Academy of
   Pediatrics specialty leaders indicated that up to 30\% of current
   nonparticipants might be interested in research involvement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric networks exist across the care continuum.
   Significant numbers of uninvolved practitioners may be interested in
   joining PCRNs. A strong majority of network leaders cited potential
   benefits from network collaboration. Pediatrics 2010;126:740-745}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Inflated responsibility has been hypothesized as an
   important influence on OCD symptoms. According to Salkovskis and
   colleagues (1999) there are in turn five developmental pathways that
   lead to inflated responsibility. Coles and Schofield (2008) proposed the
   Pathways to Responsibility Beliefs Scale (PIRBS) as a measure of these
   pathways. Method: In the present study the psychometric properties of an
   Icelandic translation of the PIRBS were evaluated and its factor
   structure was studied in a confirmatory factor analysis. Further it was
   tested whether responsibility mediated between pathways to
   responsibility beliefs and OCD symptoms. Results: While neither a four
   nor a five-factor structure of the PIRBS was found to be wholly
   satisfactory; support for the latter was slightly better. Correlations
   of the PIRBS scales with measures of responsibility and
   obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms were moderate as expected.
   Support was found for a mediating role of responsibility attitudes
   between pathways measured by the PIRBS and OCD symptoms in support of
   Salkovskis and colleagues' theory (1999). Conclusion: The PIRBS is a
   promising approach to study the developmental precursors of inflated
   responsibility and OCD symptoms but its factor structure may need a
   revision}},

   people consume disinfected water in the United States. This study was
   conducted to evaluate the potential immunotoxicological effects of DBA
   exposure when administered for 28 days via drinking water to B6C3F1
   mice, at concentrations of 125, 500, and 1000 mg/L. Multiple endpoints
   were evaluated to assess innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immune
   components, as well as host resistance. Standard toxicological
   parameters were unaffected, with the exception of a dose-responsive
   increase in liver weight and a decrease in thymus weight at the two
   highest exposure levels. Splenocyte differentials were affected,
   although the effects were not dose-responsive. Exposure to DBA did not
   significantly affect humoral immunity (immunoglobulin M {[}IgM] plaque
   assay and serum IgM anti-sheep erythrocyte titers) or cell-mediated
   immunity (mixed-leukocyte response). No effects were observed on innate
   immune function in either interferon-gamma-induced in vitro macrophage
   cytotoxic activity or basal natural killer (NK)-cell activity. Augmented
   NK-cell activity (following exposure to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid)
   was decreased at the low dose, however the effect was not
   dose-responsive. Finally, DBA exposure had no effect on resistance to
   infection with either Streptococcus pneumoniae or Plasmodium yoelii, or
   challenge with B16F10 melanoma cells. With the exception of changes in
   thymus weight, these results indicate that DBA exposure resulted in no
   immunotoxic effects at concentrations much larger than those considered
   acceptable in human drinking water.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to systematically evaluate the
   impact of methodology on thromboelastometry with canine whole blood.
   Thromboelastometry was performed on citrated blood using a variety of
   combinations of clotting activators {[}ex-tem (tissue factor or TF),
   in-tem (ellagic acid), diluted TF from Innovin, or Ca (recalcification
   only)] and storage times. Thromboelastometry was also performed using
   diluted TF from Innovin on blood collected into a contact inhibitor.
   Ex-vivo contact activation was compared between canine and human blood.
   Clotting activator had a marked impact on coagulation time, a minor
   impact on alpha angle, and no impact on clot formation time or maximum
   clot firmness. When ex-tem or in-tem was the clotting activator, sample
   storage up to 30 min did not affect results. With diluted TF from
   Innovin or Ca, sample storage was associated with the development of
   increased coagulability (as indicated by shorter coagulation time and
   clot formation time and higher alpha angle) due to ex-vivo contact
   activation. Canine blood underwent markedly more ex-vivo contact
   activation than did human blood. Canine blood undergoes significant
   ex-vivo contact activation during and after collection, which influences
   thromboelastometry results when a weak clotting activator (such as low
   TF or recalcification) is used. Thromboelastometry with a strong
   activator (such as ex-tem or in-tem) is less influenced by ex-vivo
   changes, and, therefore, likely to be more reflective of in-vivo
   hemostatic capabilities and to provide consistently interpretable and
   comparable results. Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis 21: 692-702 (c) 2010

Abstract = {{Women treated with chest radiation for a pediatric cancer have low

   This study characterized the relationship between perceptions of
   mammography and screening practices. A cross-sectional survey was
   administered to 523 women in North America who were treated with chest
   radiation before 21 years of age. Women with inconsistent mammography
   perceptions and practices were identified using the Pros and Cons of
   Mammography for perceptions and Transtheoretical Model stages of
   adoption for prior and intended screening practices. Classification and
   regression tree (CART) analysis was used to identify barriers to and
   facilitators of screening among women with positive and negative
   perceptions. Nearly one-third of the cohort had inconsistent perceptions
   and practices: 37.4\% had positive perceptions and were not having
   mammograms; 27.6\% had negative/neutral perceptions and were having
   mammograms. Regardless of perceptions, a recent physician's
   recommendation for mammography, age a parts per thousand yen 40, and
   interest in routine health care were universally associated with
   mammography practices. For women with positive perceptions and a
   physician's recommendation, barriers to screening included high
   acceptance coping, low active-planning coping, and high internal health
   locus of control. For women with negative perceptions, acknowledging the
   importance of asymptomatic screening was associated with mammography.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{69}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Victims of violence are likely to become repeat victims of
   violence. Emergency department-based secondary prevention initiatives
   have been proposed to help break the cycle of violence for these youth.
   Trauma centers, by nature of their designation, are often charged with
   the responsibility of developing these prevention initiatives. We
   hypothesize that the majority of youth who are injured by violence are
   treated in nontrauma centers. Given the goal is to prevent recurrent
   injury, trauma center-based initiatives may be misdirected.
   Methods: We used a retrospective population-based cohort study design in
   the province of Ontario to evaluate the type of facility (trauma center
   vs. nontrauma center) where injured youth (aged 15-24 years) presented
   for assessment after intentional injury. The National Ambulatory Care
   Reporting System database was used to identify all subjects during the
   years 2003-2007. Intentional injury was analyzed through E-codes and
   hospital identifiers were linked to trauma center status. Descriptive
   statistics and multiple logistic regression were performed to evaluate
   demographic and injury characteristics predictive of patients presenting
   to a trauma center.
   Results: The cohort included 51,487 patients presenting to 193 hospitals
   in Ontario. The mean age was 19.4 years and 80\% were men. Eighty
   percent (80\%) of youth injured by violence were treated at nontrauma
   centers. Patients with injuries caused by blunt objects (odds ratio
   {[}OR], 1.51 {[}95\% confidence interval \{CI\}: 1.39-1.65]), stab
   wounds (OR, 1.62 {[}95\% CI: 1.50-1.75]), and gunshot wounds (OR, 4.18
   {[}95\% CI: 3.21-5.45]) were more likely to attend trauma centers than
   those with injuries because of bodily force. Patients who attended
   trauma centers were more likely to be admitted (OR, 3.58 {[}95\% CI:
   3.25-3.96]) or die in hospital (OR, 2.18 {[}95\% CI: 1.12-4.26]).
   Conclusions: Given the vast majority of patients are not seen at trauma
   centers, any prevention initiatives located here will not achieve the
   goals of preventing recurrent injury on a population basis. Secondary
   prevention initiatives should be implemented and evaluated in nontrauma
   centers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose We evaluated the location of porous gelatin particles (GP;
   Gelpart; Nippon Kayaku/Astellas, Tokyo, Japan) within the arterial
   vasculature and their acute effects on uterine necrosis and inflammation
   after uterine artery embolization (UAE) in swine.
   Materials and Methods Adult nonpregnant pigs (n = 6) were allocated to
   either 1- (n = 3) or 2-mm GP (n = 3). Superselective and bilateral
   embolization of the uterine arteries was performed. All animals were
   killed 1 week after UAE. Macroscopic and microscopic findings, including
   the level of arterial occlusion and their effect on uterine necrosis and
   inflammation, were analyzed.
   Results All UAE procedures were completed without severe complications.
   The macroscopic necrosis was seen in two animals in the 2-mm group with
   an extent of <50\%. The location of the occluded arteries did not differ
   significantly between groups. The median diameters of the occluded
   arteries were 449 mu m (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 417-538 mu m) in
   the 1-mm GP group and 484 mu m (95\% CI 370-560 mu m) in the 2-mm GP
   group. As for microscopic necrosis, no statistically significant
   difference was observed. The qualitative inflammatory reaction was
   significantly greater in the 2-mm GP group than in the 1-mm group (p <
   0.001).
   Conclusions Both 1- and 2-mm GP occluded the arteries relevant to the
   target diameter for UAE in porcine uterus, presumably due to the plastic
   deformity. Both sizes of GP were associated with limited areas of
   necrosis; however, evaluation of inflammatory reaction was preliminary.
   Further study with adequate evaluation of inflammatory reactions is
   suggested.}},

Abstract = {{P>We have shown that immunization with dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with
   hepatitis B virus core antigen virus-like particles (HBc-VLP) packaging
   with cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) (HBc-VLP/CpG) alone were able
   to delay melanoma growth but not able to eradicate the established
   tumour in mice. We tested whether, by modulating the vaccination
   approaches and injection times, the anti-tumour activity could be
   enhanced. We used a B16-HBc melanoma murine model not only to compare
   the efficacy of DC vaccine immunized via footpads, intravenously or via
   intratumoral injections in treating melanoma and priming tumour-specific
   immune responses, but also to observe how DC vaccination could improve
   the efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells to induce an enhanced
   anti-tumour immune response. Our results indicate that, although all
   vaccination approaches were able to protect mice from developing
   melanoma, only three intratumoral injections of DCs could induce a
   significant anti-tumour response. Furthermore, the combination of
   intratumoral DC vaccination and adoptive T cell transfer led to a more
   robust anti-tumour response than the use of each treatment individually
   by increasing CD8+ T cells or the ratio of CD8+ T cell/regulatory T
   cells in the tumour site. Moreover, the combination vaccination induced
   tumour-specific immune responses that led to tumour regression and
   protected surviving mice from tumour rechallenge, which is attributed to
   an increase in CD127-expressing and interferon-gamma-producing CD8+ T
   cells. Taken together, these results indicate that repeated intratumoral
   DC vaccination not only induces expansion of antigen-specific T cells
   against tumour-associated antigens in tumour sites, but also leads to
   elimination of pre-established tumours, supporting this combined
   approach as a potent strategy for DC-based cancer immunotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids have been proposed as a way of integrating large numbers of
   distributed renewable energy sources with distribution systems. One
   problem with microgrid implementation is designing a proper protection
   scheme. It has been shown that traditional protection schemes will not
   work successfully. In this paper a protection scheme using digital
   relays with a communication network is proposed for the protection of
   the microgrid system. The increased reliability of adding an additional
   line to form a loop structure is explored. Also a novel method for
   modeling high impedance faults is demonstrated to show how the
   protection scheme can protect against them. This protection scheme is
   simulated on a realistic distribution system containing a high
   penetration of inverter connected Distributed Generation (DG) sources
   operating as a microgrid. In all possible cases of operation the primary
   and secondary relays performed their intended functions including the
   detection of high impedance faults. This system is simulated using
   Matlab Simulink's SimPowerSystems toolbox to establish the claims made
   in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Background Although percentage risk formats are commonly used to convey
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, people find it difficult to
   understand these representations.
   Aims To compare the impact of providing a CVD risk message in either a
   traditional format (\% risk) or using an analogy of risk (Heart-Age) on
   participants' risk perceptions and intention to make lifestyle changes.
   Methods Four hundred and thirteen men and women were randomly allocated
   to one of two conditions; CVD risk as a percentage or as a Heart-Age
   score (a cardiovascular risk adjusted age).
   Results There was a graded relationship between perceived and actual CVD
   risk only in those participants receiving a Heart-Age message (P<0.05).
   Heart-Age was more emotionally impactful in younger individuals at
   higher actual CVD risk (P<0.01). Self-reported emotional reactions
   further mediated the relationship between risk perception and intention
   to make lifestyle changes.
   Conclusion This study found that the Heart-Age message significantly
   differed from percentage CVD risk score in risk perceptions and was more
   emotionally impactful in those participants at higher actual CVD risk

Abstract = {{MgH2 75 at.\%-C 25 at.\% composites are synthesized by ball milling
   using different kinds of carbon additives: carbon black (CB),
   nanodiamonds (ND) and amorphous carbon soot (AC). X-ray diffraction
   analysis showed that the MgH2 phase in the as-obtained composite powders
   is nanocrystalline (80-100 nm). The SEM observations revealed that the
   samples consist of 5-15 mu m MgH2 particles, surrounded and in some
   cases coated by carbon flakes. The composite containing nanodiamonds
   revealed strong decrease of the MgH2 decomposition temperature with more
   than 100 degrees C, compared to ball-milled pure MgH2. Important issue
   of the present study is also the low temperature hydriding of the
   ball-milled Mg-C nanocomposites, investigated by high-pressure DSC. The
   process starts at about 200 degrees C for all materials studied, but the
   hydriding mechanism looks different for the composites with different
   kinds of carbon additives. Whereas for Mg-carbon black it takes place in
   a relatively narrow temperature range, expressed by a single exothermic
   peak (200-300 degrees C) for the other two composites the hydriding is a
   multi-step process, featured by two overlapped exothermic peaks for
   Mg-nanodiamonds and by two well separated exothermic effects (at about
   300 degrees C and 400 degrees C) for Mg-amorphous carbon soot. The
   observed difference in the hydriding behavior of the Mg-C composites is
   attributed to the different kind of carbon component, which is supposed
   to play a catalytic role as well as protects magnesium from oxidation.
   The incorporation of carbon into the MgH2 particles results in the
   formation of high density of defects (dislocations and grain
   boundaries), which is supposed to be among the most possible reasons for
   the decreased hydride decomposition temperature. The Mg-C nanocomposites
   show reproducible hydriding/dehydriding behavior (thermodynamics and
   kinetics) during multiple cycling. Among the composites in the present
   study ``Mg-carbon black{''} reveals the best hydriding characteristics
   low temperature of hydriding in a relatively narrow temperature range by
   a single-step reaction and relatively fast hydriding kinetics. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a law banning the use of
   cellular phones by drivers in the Canadian province of Alberta.
   Method: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a probabilistic
   decision-analytic model and publicly available data. We adopted a
   societal perspective. Health gains were measured in terms of
   quality-adjusted life-years. Costs include those associated with
   awareness raising, enforcement and the welfare loss associated with the
   reduction in cellular phone use, less savings in health care and other
   costs associated with automobile accidents.
   Results: A ban promotes health and releases resources worth more than
   the costs. There is an 80\% chance that a ban will be `cost saving', and
   a 94\% chance that a ban will cost less than Can\$50 000/QALY. The
   results are sensitive to the additional risk posed by cellular phone use
   while driving, and the rate and pattern with which drivers comply with a
   ban.
   Conclusion: Under our base line assumptions a cellular phone ban is
   likely to be cost saving from a societal perspective. The results are
   sensitive to parameters for which there is very little information or
   for which the available information is contradictory. Copyright (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Purpose: We report varicocele prevalence in adolescents. Surgical
   treatment has been proposed in adolescents with relevant testicular
   disproportion to avoid fertility problems in adulthood. We prospectively
   analyzed the testicular volume variation in adolescents with varicocele
   and hypoplastic testis.
   Materials and Methods: In a 2-year period we selected 54 consecutive
   pediatric patients with a median age of 14.5 years (range 13 to 16) who
   had left varicocele using certain criteria, including testicular volume
   discrepancy greater than 20\%, no previous inguinal-testicular surgery
   and no symptoms. Adolescents were divided into 2 groups, including 27
   who underwent surgical correction with lymphatic sparing microsurgical
   varicocelectomy (intervention) and 27 who were only observed (control).
   After surgery or at first observation patients were evaluated clinically
   and by ultrasound at 3, 6 and 12 months. Testicular volume was estimated
   by the prolate ellipsoid formula.
   Results: We noted significant improvement in testicular volume with less
   than 20\% disparity between the 2 gonads in 23 patients (85.2\%) in the
   intervention group and in 8 controls (29.6\%). Two recurrences (7.4\%)
   were reported in the intervention group, each in an adolescent with
   increased testicular volume.
   Conclusions: Our study confirms significantly increased testicular
   volume in many surgically treated boys and shows that physiological
   catch-up growth occurs in adolescents with varicocele without treatment.
   Considering critically results in each group, in select cases clinical
   and ultrasound followup is indicated before intervention due to a
   possible spontaneous decrease in testicular asymmetry. Further
   histopathological studies are needed to identify the relationship
   between testicular hypoplasia, irreversible damage and future fertility
   problems to determine which adolescents should be treated.}},

Abstract = {{The segregation of suri and huacaya fleece types in alpacas in the

   noted. These results are consistent with a single autosomal dominant
   gene controlling sun i fleece production, with an additional relatively
   common genetic mechanism that can suppress the sun i phenotype in some
   animals. These results are especially important in cases where the two
   fleece types are crossed with one another, as they result in a relative

Abstract = {{The effect of flow rate on the methanol electro-oxidation reaction in
   laminar flow was investigated using a direct methanol laminar flow fuel
   cell (LF-FC). A micro fuel cell was fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane
   using standard soft-lithography techniques. The electrochemical
   performance of methanol oxidation was characterized by anode
   polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis with
   and without sulfuric acid. The results show that in the absence of a
   sulfuric acid electrolyte (H2SO4) the methanol flow rate significantly
   influences methanol oxidation kinetics of the laminar flow direct
   methanol fuel cell. In the absence of H2SO4, it was found that the
   charge transfer resistance and onset potential of the methanol oxidation
   reaction significantly increases as the methanol flow rate increases. As
   a result, the anode current density of LF-FCs decreases at higher flow
   rates of methanol. However, this negative effect was reduced when a
   strong electrolyte, such as sulfuric acid, was mixed with the methanol

Abstract = {{Study objective: Emergency department (ED) crowding increases ambulance
   diversion. Ambulance diversion disproportionately affects individuals
   who rely on ambulance transport. The purpose of this study is to
   determine which populations rely most on ambulance transport.
   Methods: We queried the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
   database for 1997 to 2000 and 2003 to 2005 for patients who arrived by
   ambulance or personal transport. We performed bivariate analysis to
   assess the extent to which all patients and a subset of critically ill
   patients use ambulance transport relative to self-transport.
   Results: In our sample, 30,455 (15\%; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   15\% to 16\%) patients arrived by ambulance and 162,091 (85\%; 95\% CI
   84\% to 85\%) arrived by walk-in/self-transport. Overall, patients with
   Medicare insurance were more likely to rely on ambulance transport, at
   34\% (95\% CI 33\% to 35\%), than the privately insured, at 11\% (95\%
   CI 10\% to 11\%). Among the critically ill, privately insured patients
   were less likely to rely on ambulance transport, at 47\% (95\% CI 42\%
   to 52\%), than those with Medicare insurance (61\%; 95\% CI 58\% to
   65\%), the publicly insured (60\%; 95\% CI 52\% to 67\%), or the
   uninsured (57\%; 95\% CI 49\% to 64\%). Among the critically ill,
   patients aged 15 to 24 years and those older than 74 years were most
   likely to rely on ambulance transport, at 63\% (95\% CI 53\% to 72\%)
   and 67\% (95\% CI 62\% to 71\%), respectively. Fifty-seven percent (95\%
   CI 54\% to 59\%) of the critically ill used ambulance versus 15\% (95\%
   CI 14\% to 15\%) of noncritical patients.
   Conclusion: Patients with Medicare insurance or public insurance, the

   on ambulance transport to the ED. Ambulance diversion may
   disproportionately affect these populations. {[}Ann Emerg Med.

Abstract = {{The Indonesian traditional fermented food, red fermented peanut cake
   (oncom merah) limited to West Java is produced from legume residues by
   filamentous fungus Neurospora sp. Oncom Bandung is prepared from peanut
   residues after oil extraction. Conidia, usually oval and pink in color,
   form branched chains at the tips of the aerial hyphae. Since the pigment
   of the fungus can be utilized in pharmacy and food. We are interested to
   study the fungus for further utilization in pharmacy. In this study, the
   molecular identification of Neurospora sp N-1 which was isolated from
   oncom merah was carried out based on the genetic analysis partially on
   ribosomal DNA included the subunit of 28S rDNA (D1/D2 region) and
   Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS). Results analysis showed that
   Neurospora sp N-1 was homology 100\% by amplification on D1/D2 region
   and 99\% by amplification on ITS region to Neurospora intermedia. Based
   on phylogenetic analysis using D1/D2 region and ITS methods, Neurospora
   intermedia N-1 has a close relation to Neurospora crassa. We concluded
   that the fungus Neurospora sp N-1 isolated from oncom Bandung is
   Neurospora intermedia. It is a new information since it before that the
   fungus for oncom merah fermentation was Neurospora sitophila.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclical electrical field flow fractionation (CyElFFF) is a variation on
   electrical field flow fractionation (ElFFF) where cyclical electrical
   fields are used instead of steady DC fields to increase the effective
   field experienced by particles in the flow channel. Even though the
   effective field increases more than 20-fold compared to normal ElFFF,
   the retention and resolution in CyElFFF has not been shown to be better
   than in ElFFF. In this paper we report how one can optimize operational
   parameters in CyElFFF to obtain good retention and resolution in
   CyElFFF. The effects of offset voltage, frequency, flowrate,
   concentration of particles and sample size on retention, resolution and
   retained peak/void peak ratio have been observed. The results obtained
   from these experiments were analyzed and suggestions have been made to
   improve both retention and resolution. A 4-fold improvement in retention
   without a significant increase in band broadening is reported.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) enables the
   investigation of hydrated and uncoated plant samples and the in situ
   observation of dynamic processes. Water vapor in the microscope chamber
   takes part in secondary electron detection and charge prevention. Two
   ESEM modes are available and offer a broad spectrum of applications. The
   environmental or wet mode prevents sample dehydration by the combination
   of sample cooling (5A degrees C) and a vapor pressure of 4-6 Torr. In
   the low vacuum mode, the maximum chamber pressure is limited to 1 Torr
   (corresponding to about 5\% relative humidity in the chamber) and allows
   the simultaneous use of a backscattered electron detector for imaging
   material contrast. A selection of characteristic plant samples and
   various applications are presented as a guide to ESEM for plant
   scientists. Leaf surfaces, trichomes, epicuticular waxes, and inorganic
   surface layers represent samples being comparatively resistant to
   dehydration, whereas callus cells and stigmatic tissue are examples for
   dehydration- and beam-sensitive samples. The potential of investigating
   dynamic processes in situ is demonstrated by studying anther opening, by
   tensile testing of leaves, and by performing hydration/dehydration
   experiments by changing the vapor pressure. Additionally, automated
   block-face imaging and serial sectioning using in situ ultramicrotomy is
   presented. The strengths and weaknesses of ESEM are discussed and it is
   shown that ESEM is a versatile tool in plant science.}},

Abstract = {{Single event electrospraying (SEE) is a method for on-demand deposition
   of picoliter volumes of liquids. The steady electrospraying of water in
   the cone-jet mode is difficult under normal operating conditions. This
   paper shows that SEE can be used for water to deposit very small volumes
   (1 pL) and spray water in a stable pulsed cone-jet mode. The stability
   regime for SEE of deionized water with regard to pulse time and
   frequency of applied voltage was determined and was explained by the
   analysis of the characteristic times involved in SEE. With our unique
   set-up it is possible to use a pulsed cone-jet mode for a stable
   ejection on-demand. The pulse time for stable SEE of water is limited
   due to the time of formation of a space charge in between the nozzle and
   the counter electrode. Moreover, the maximum pulse frequency is limited
   to two times the natural oscillation frequency of the liquid.
   Additionally, the volume of liquid deposited per SEE can be calculated
   using a theoretical consideration of the electrohydrodynamic
   displacement of water inside the capillary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the frequency, root cause, and outcome of
   wrong-site and wrong-patient procedures in the era of the Universal
   Protocol.
   Design: Analysis of a prospective physician insurance database performed
   from January 1, 2002, to June 1, 2008. Deidentified cases were screened
   using predefined taxonomy filters, and data were analyzed by evaluation
   criteria defined a priori.
   Setting: Colorado.
   Patients: Database contained 27 370 physician self-reported adverse
   occurrences.
   Main Outcome Measures: Descriptive statistics were generated to examine
   the characteristics of the reporting physicians, the number of adverse
   events reported per year, and the root causes and occurrence-related
   patient outcomes.
   Results: A total of 25 wrong-patient and 107 wrong-site procedures were
   identified during the study period. Significant harm was inflicted in 5
   wrong-patient procedures (20.0\%) and 38 wrong-site procedures (35.5\%).
   One patient died secondary to a wrong-site procedure (0.9\%). The main
   root causes leading to wrong-patient procedures were errors in diagnosis
   (56.0\%) and errors in communication (100\%), whereas wrong-site
   occurrences were related to errors in judgment (85.0\%) and the lack of
   performing a ``time-out{''} (72.0\%). Nonsurgical specialties were
   involved in the cause of wrong-patient procedures and contributed
   equally with surgical disciplines to adverse outcome related to
   wrong-site occurrences.
   Conclusions: These data reveal a persisting high frequency of surgical
   ``never events.{''} Strict adherence to the Universal Protocol must be
   expanded to nonsurgical specialties to promote a zero-tolerance
   philosophy for these preventable incidents.}},

   who had received a minimum of 1 year of treatment with stimulant
   medication were compared to adolescents with a childhood history of ADHD
   who were never treated with stimulants and a demographically matched
   comparison group on self-reports of depressive symptoms and diagnoses of
   depressive disorders. Both subgroups with childhood ADHD reported
   significantly higher dimensional ratings of depression and categorical
   rates of depressive disorders relative to the comparison group (all p <

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-A blood-based biomarker of acute ischemic stroke
   would be of significant value in clinical practice. This study aimed to
   (1) replicate in a larger cohort our previous study using gene
   expression profiling to predict ischemic stroke; and (2) refine
   prediction of ischemic stroke by including control groups relevant to
   ischemic stroke.
   Methods-Patients with ischemic stroke (n=70, 199 samples) were compared
   with control subjects who were healthy (n=38), had vascular risk factors
   (n=52), and who had myocardial infarction (n=17). Whole blood was drawn
   <= 3 hours, 5 hours, and 24 hours after stroke onset and from control
   subjects. RNA was processed on whole genome microarrays. Genes
   differentially expressed in ischemic stroke were identified and analyzed
   for predictive ability to discriminate stroke from control subjects.
   Results-The 29 probe sets previously reported predicted a new set of
   ischemic strokes with 93.5\% sensitivity and 89.5\% specificity.
   Sixty-and 46-probe sets differentiated control groups from 3-hour and
   24-hour ischemic stroke samples, respectively. A 97-probe set correctly
   classified 86\% of ischemic strokes (3 hour + 24 hour), 84\% of healthy
   subjects, 96\% of vascular risk factor subjects, and 75\% with
   myocardial infarction.
   Conclusions-This study replicated our previously reported gene
   expression profile in a larger cohort and identified additional genes
   that discriminate ischemic stroke from relevant control groups. This
   multigene approach shows potential for a point-of-care test in acute
   ischemic stroke. (Stroke. 2010;41:2171-2177.)}},

Abstract = {{The subcommissural organ (SCO) is a roof plate differentiation located
   in the caudal diencephalon under the posterior commissure (PC). A role
   for SCO and its secretory product, SCO-spondin, in the formation of the
   PC has been proposed. Here, we provide immunohistochemical evidence to
   suggest that SCO is anatomically divided in a bilateral region positive
   for SCO-spondin that surrounds a negative medial region. Remarkably,
   axons contacting the lateral region are highly fasciculated, in sharp
   contrast with the defasciculated axons of the medial region. In
   addition, lateral axon fascicles run toward the midline inside of
   tunnels limited by the basal prolongations of SCO cells and
   extracellular SCO-spondin. Our in vitro data in collagen gel matrices
   show that SCO-spondin induces axonal growth and fasciculation of
   pretectal explants. Together, our findings support the idea that
   SCO-spondin participates in the guidance and fasciculation of axons of
   the PC. Developmental Dynamics 239:2584-2593, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss,

Title = {{Pneumonia following antipsychotic prescriptions in electronic health
   records: a patient safety concern?}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{579}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background
   In screening the Intercontinental Medical Statistics (IMS) Health
   Disease Analyzer database of GP records from the UK, an increased
   registration of pneumonia subsequent to the prescription of some
   antipsychotic medicines was identified.
   Aim
   To investigate the temporal pattern between antipsychotic prescriptions
   and pneumonia with respect to age, type of pneumonia and other chest
   infections, and antipsychotic class.
   Design of study
   Self-controlled cohort analysis.
   Setting
   Electronic health records from the UK IMS Health Disease Analyzer
   database.
   Method
   Three groups of pneumonia-related International Classification of
   Diseases (ICD)-10 terms and prescriptions of atypical and conventional
   antipsychotic medicines were studied. Separate analyses were carried out
   for patients aged >= 65 years. The observed rate of pneumonia terms
   registered in different time periods in connection to antipsychotic
   prescriptions was contrasted to the overall rate of pneumonia terms
   relative to prescriptions of other drugs in the same dataset.
   Results
   In patients aged >= 65 years, an increased registration of a group of
   terms defined as `acute chest infections', after atypical antipsychotic
   prescriptions, was identified. The corresponding increase after
   conventional antipsychotic prescriptions was much smaller.
   Bronchopneumonia had a striking increase after both atypical and
   conventional antipsychotic prescriptions, and was commonly recorded with
   fatal outcome. Few registrations of hypostatic. pneumonia were noted.
   Patients aged <65 years did not have a higher rate of acute chest
   infections after receiving antipsychotic prescriptions.
   Conclusion
   The consistent pattern of an increased rate of chest infections after
   atypical antipsychotic prescriptions in older people seen in this
   outpatient study, together with the higher risk shown in a previous
   study on hospitalised patients, suggests a causal relationship. This is
   of importance since bronchopneumonia seems highly linked to fatal
   outcome. In the absence of a mechanism, further investigation of the
   role of antipsychotics in older people is needed.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{S19-S22}},

Abstract = {{Staphylococcus aureus is a well adapted human pathogen, capable of
   living freely in the inanimate environment and spreading from person to
   person, existing as a colonizer or commensal, hiding in intracellular
   compartments and, most importantly, inducing various forms of human
   disease. Infections caused by S. aureus, above all by
   antibiotic-resistant strains, have reached epidemic proportions
   globally. The overall burden of staphylococcal disease caused by
   antibiotic-resistant S. aureus, particularly by the
   methicillin-resistant strains, is increasing in many countries,
   including Italy, in both healthcare and community settings. The
   widespread use of antibiotics has undoubtedly accelerated the evolution
   of S. aureus, which, acquiring multiple resistance genes, has become
   able to survive almost all antibiotic families; this evolution versus
   more resistant phenotypes has continued among the newer agents,
   including linezolid and daptomycin. The diminished clinical usefulness
   of vancomycin is seen as one of the most worrisome problems in many
   clinical settings and in many countries. In fact, the increasing spread
   of heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) and
   vancomycin intermediate ( VISA) strains adds new problems, not only in
   terms of the treatment of severe infections sustained by these
   microorganisms, but also in the microbiological definition of
   susceptibility. (C) 2010 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

Abstract = {{Research shows widespread misunderstanding of stocks and flows, even
   among highly educated adults. People fail to grasp that any stock rises
   (falls) when the inflow exceeds (is less than) the outflow. Rather,
   people often use the correlation heuristic, concluding that a system's
   output is positively correlated with its inputs. Although many argue
   that system dynamics training will help, evidence is scant. This paper
   reports an experiment with MIT graduate students to assess the impact of
   an introductory system dynamics course on intuitive understanding of
   accumulation. Results show large, statistically significant improvements
   in overall performance and a reduction in the prevalence of the
   correlation heuristic. Modest exposure to stocks and flows improves
   understanding of accumulation, at least among these highly educated
   adults. However, a minority still show evidence of correlational
   reasoning. The discussion considers additional experiments to deepen our
   knowledge of the training required to develop people's intuitive
   understanding of accumulation. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Accurate medication histories at hospital admission are an
   important element of medication safety. Discrepancies may have
   clinically significant consequences, especially in the elderly
   population.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical pharmacist's performance in obtaining
   patients' medication histories and in reconciling these data with the
   medical records and medication orders and whether the patients'
   residential situation prior to hospitalization influences the number of
   drug discrepancies.
   METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted at a 29-bed
   acute geriatric ward of a Belgian university hospital. Medication
   histories acquired by clinical pharmacists were compared with those
   documented in the medical records by the attending physicians. All
   discrepancies were identified and categorized by an independent
   pharmacist and were scored for their clinical relevance in consensus by
   a senior internist and a senior geriatrician.
   RESULTS: Of the 215 screened geriatric (aged >= 65 years) patients
   admitted between October 27, 2007, and September 23, 2008, 197 were
   enrolled in the study. For patients living in the community, as well as
   those residing in a nursing home prior to hospitalization, clinical
   pharmacists identified significantly more preadmission drugs compared
   with physicians, with a median number of 8 correctly identified
   medications versus 6, respectively (p < 0.001). Extra identified drugs
   consisted of over-the-counter as well as prescription medications.
   Furthermore, 117 other medication discrepancies were noted, mainly
   related to erroneous drug identification and incorrect drug dose. In
   all, the clinical pharmacists identified 379 (24.2\%) medication
   discrepancies, of which 188 (49.6\%) were judged clinically relevant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist-acquired medication histories enhance the
   medication reconciliation process, both in patients residing at home and
   in a nursing home prior to hospitalization. A focus should be placed on
   seamless care procedures that facilitate the transfer of medication
   histories between primary and secondary care in both of these
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To develop and validate an assessment tool, based on the
   `Royal College of General Practitioners' (RCGP) Video Assessment Tool',
   for assessment of pharmacist prescribers' consultation skills.
   Methods. Competency areas of the RCGP tool were left unchanged but
   performance criteria for each were modified to reflect pharmacist
   prescribing. Each criterion and the overall consultation were rated from
   1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).
   A purposive sample of 10 experienced prescribing pharmacists was
   selected. Each pharmacist identified, recruited and consented two
   patients. Video recordings of consultations were assessed independently
   by two randomly assigned GPs, experienced in the use of the RCGP tool,
   using the newly developed scale. Inter-rater reliability was assessed.
   Construct validity was assessed by comparing the assessor score with a
   patient satisfaction score. Spearman's rho was used to test the
   correlation between the two scores.
   Results. The RCGP tool was modified to give the `Pharmacist Consultation
   Assessment Tool' (PharmaCAT). The median overall PharmaCAT consultation
   rating was 3. There was good agreement between the two assessors for
   total scores (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.694).
   Fourteen (78\%) patient satisfaction questionnaires were returned; most
   (n = 13, 93\%) agreed/strongly agreed that they were entirely satisfied
   with the consultation. Correlations between average total scores on
   PharmaCAT and the patient satisfaction questionnaire were weak
   (Spearman's rho = 0.142 and 0.242 for both assessors).
   Conclusions. The PharmaCAT has been tested in the pharmacist prescriber
   setting. The tool had discriminatory power across different domains and
   inter-rater reliability. The PharmaCAT has potential to be used as a
   formative and/or summative assessment tool.}},

   electrophysiological recordings, we examined the activation of
   frontoparietal areas during visual stimulation in the awake, fixating
   monkey. We measured activity with BOLD fMRI in three animals and
   analyzed the data individually for each animal and at group level. We
   found reliable activations in lateral prefrontal and parietal areas,
   even though task-related decision making was minimal, as a response to
   simple update of visual information. These activations were significant
   for each individual animal, as well as at group level. Similar to human
   imaging results the update of visual input was enough to activate an
   extensive network of frontoparietal cortex in the macaque brain, a
   network which is normally associated with complex cognitive control

Abstract = {{Analyses of the effects of extreme climate periods have been used as a
   tool to predict ecosystem functioning and processes in a warmer world.
   The winter half-year 2006/2007 (w06/07) has been extremely warm and was
   estimated to be a half-a-millennium event in central Europe. Here we
   analyse the consequences of w06/07 for the temperatures, mixing
   dynamics, phenologies and population developments of algae and daphnids
   (thereafter w06/07 limnology) in a deep central European lake and
   investigate to what extent analysis of w06/07 limnology can really be
   used as a predictive tool regarding future warming. Different approaches
   were used to put the observations during w06/07 into context: (1) a
   comparison of w06/07 limnology with long-term data, (2) a comparison of
   w06/07 limnology with that of the preceding year, and (3) modelling of
   temperature and mixing dynamics using numerical experiments. These
   analyses revealed that w06/07 limnology in Lake Constance was indeed
   very special as the lake did not mix below 60 m depth throughout winter.
   Because of this, anomalies of variables associated strongly with mixing
   behaviour, e.g., Schmidt stability and a measure for phosphorus upward
   mixing during winter exceeded several standard deviations the long-term
   mean of these variables. However, our modelling results suggest that
   this extreme hydrodynamical behaviour was only partially due to w06/07
   meteorology per se, but depended also strongly on the large difference
   in air temperature to the previous cold winter which resulted in
   complete mixing and considerable cooling of the water column.
   Furthermore, modelling results demonstrated that with respect to
   absolute water temperatures, the model `w06/07' most likely
   underestimates the increase in water temperature in a warmer world as
   one warm winter is not sufficient to rise water temperatures in a deep
   lake up to those expected under a future climate.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the structure of plant communities may have much more impact
   on ecosystem carbon (C) cycling than any phenotypic responses to
   environmental changes. We studied these impacts via the response of
   plant litter quality, at the level of species and community, to
   persistent water-level (WL) drawdown in peatlands. We studied three
   sites with different nutrient regimes, and water-level manipulations at
   two time scales. The parameters used to characterize litter quality
   included extractable substances, cellulose, holocellulose, composition
   of hemicellulose (neutral sugars, uronic acids), Klason lignin, CuO
   oxidation phenolic products, and concentrations of C and several
   nutrients. The litters formed four chemically distinct groups:
   non-graminoid foliar litters, graminoids, mosses and woody litters.
   Direct effects of WL drawdown on litter quality at the species level
   were overruled by indirect effects via changes in litter type
   composition. The pristine conditions were characterized by Sphagnum moss
   and graminoid litters. Short-term (years) responses of the litter inputs
   to WL drawdown were small. In long-term (decades), total litter inputs
   increased, due to increased tree litter inputs. Simultaneously, the
   litter type composition and its chemical quality at the community level
   greatly changed. The changes that we documented will strongly affect
   soil properties and C cycle of peatlands.}},

Abstract = {{Micropore membranes have been used to form arrays of microinterfaces
   between immiscible electrolyte solutions (A mu ITIES) as a basis for the
   sensing of non-redox-active ions. Implementation of stripping
   voltammetry as a sensing method at these arrays of A mu ITIES was
   applied recently to detect drugs and biomolecules at low concentrations.
   The present study uses computational simulation to investigate the
   optimum conditions for stripping voltammetric sensing at the A mu ITIES
   array. In this scenario, the diffusion of ions in both the aqueous and
   the organic phases contributes to the sensing response. The influence of
   the preconcentration time, the micropore aspect ratio, the location of
   the microinterface within the pore, the ratio of the diffusion
   coefficients of the analyte ion in the organic and aqueous phases, and
   the pore wall angle were investigated. The simulations reveal that the
   accessibility of the microinterfaces during the preconcentration period
   should not be hampered by a recessed interface and that diffusional
   transport in the phase where the analyte ions are preconcentrated should
   be minimized. This will ensure that the ions are accumulated within the
   micropores close to the interface and thus be readily available for back
   transfer during the stripping process. On the basis of the results, an
   optimal combination of the examined parameters is proposed, which
   together improve the stripping voltammetric signal and provide an
   improvement in the detection limit.}},

Abstract = {{A toolkit (BEUDcal) has been developed for evaluating the effectiveness
   and for predicting the outcome of treatment plans by calculating the
   biologically effective uniform dose (BEUD) and complication-free tumor
   control probability. The input for the BEUDcal is the differential
   dose-volume histograms of organs exported from the treatment planning
   system. A clinical database is built for the dose-response parameters of
   different tumors and normal tissues. Dose-response probabilities of all
   the examined organs are illustrated together with the corresponding
   BEUDs and the P+ values. Furthermore, BEUDcal is able to generate a
   report that simultaneously presents the radiobiological evaluation
   together with the physical dose indices, showing the complementary
   relation between the physical and radiobiological treatment plan
   analysis performed by BEUDcal. Comparisons between treatment plans for
   helical tomotherapy and multileaf collimator-based intensity modulated
   radiotherapy of a lung patient were demonstrated to show the versatility
   of BEUDcal in the assessment and report of dose-response relations. (C)

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this prospective dose-finding pilot study is to
   demonstrate the tolerability and safety of four dosages of 25\% human
   albumin in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). For each dosage
   group, the study will enroll 20 patients who meet the eligibility
   criteria. The enrolled patients will undergo follow-up for 90 days
   post-treatment. The primary tolerability hypothesis is that intravenous
   25\% human albumin can be given without precipitating treatment related
   serious adverse events beyond expectations. The study will determine the
   maximum tolerated dosage of 25\% human albumin therapy based on the rate
   of treatment related serious adverse events during treatment: severe or
   life-threatening heart failure. The secondary objectives are to obtain
   preliminary estimates of the albumin treatment effect using the
   incidence of neurological deterioration within 15 days after symptom
   onset. In addition, the incidence of rebleeding, hydrocephalus,
   seizures, delayed cerebral ischemia and the incidence of vasospasm (both
   symptomatic and by transcranial Doppler ultrasound criteria) within 15
   days after symptom onset will be evaluated. Furthermore, the serum
   osmolality and serum albumin concentrations, serum magnesium
   concentration, blood pressure and heart rate within 15 days of symptom
   onset will also be observed. The Glasgow Outcome Scale, Barthel Index,
   modified Rankin Scale, NIH Stroke Scale, and Stroke Impact Scale will be
   performed 3 months after the onset of symptoms to assess residual
   neurological deficits.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental consequences of corrosion on metals are enormous and
   its inhibition has been deeply investigated. The use of inhibitors is
   one of the most practical methods for protection against corrosion,
   especially in acidic media(1). Inhibitors play an important role in
   controlling corrosion of metals(2). The use of naturally occurring
   substances as inhibitors for metals exposed to acid environment has
   continued to receive attention as replacement for synthesized organic
   inhibitors mainly due to its biodegradability and eco- friendliness.
   Natural oil extracted from Pennyroyal mint was evaluated as corrosion
   inhibitor of steel in molar hydrochloric acid(3). Extracts of different
   parts of Carica papaya (seeds, leaves, heart wood and bark) were proved
   as eco- friendly corrosion inhibitors(4). Acidic extracts of Ficus
   benghalensis and sprouted seeds of Phaseolus aureus were also found to
   have excellent inhibition properties(5,6).
   Green inhibitors displaying substantially improved environmental
   properties will be the inhibitors most widely used in future. Hence, the
   present study has been effectuated to investigate the action of seed
   extract of Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (CT) on corrosion inhibition of mild

Abstract = {{Developmental changes of cell adhesion molecule expression, especially
   in nonparenchymal cells, have hardly ever been analyzed in the murine
   liver. The present study was undertaken to immunohistochemically examine
   the expression of NCAM, ICAM, VCAM, and N-cadherin during mouse liver
   development and in fetal liver cell cultures. NCAM was transiently
   expressed in mesenchymal cells of the septum transversum and sinusoidal
   cells in liver development. In vitro studies demonstrated that
   desmin-positive stellate cells expressed this cell adhesion molecule.
   NCAM expression in periportal biliary epithelial cells and connective
   tissue cells also coincided well with bile duct remodeling processes in
   the perinatal periods. Expression of ICAM and VCAM was transiently
   restricted to hepatoblasts, hepatocytes and hemopoietic cells in fetal
   stages. N-cadherin was expressed not only in hepatoblasts and
   hepatocytes, but also in nonparenchymal cells such as endothelial cells,
   stellate cells and connective tissue cells, however the expression was
   weak. These results suggest that each cell adhesion molecule may play an
   important role during development in hepatic histogenesis, including
   hepatoblast/ hepatocyte-stellate cell interactions, hemopoiesis, and
   bile duct morphogenesis. Anat Rec, 293:1698-1710, 2010. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Defining a methodology for measuring temperature in fire resistance

   thermometers, bare-bead thermocouples, Inconel grounded and ungrounded

   thermocouples provided comparable results to those of the bear-bead
   thermocouples and are most suitable when a fast response time is
   desirable. Because of the fast response time and good durability,
   grounded and ungrounded junction thermocouples are well-suited for use
   in controlling the temperature in fire resistance standard test
   furnaces. The predicted and measured incident heat flux in furnaces
   controlled by either the bare-bead or grounded and ungrounded sheathed

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a set of methods to map the American Community
   Survey (ACS) data disseminated by the U.S. Census Bureau. The ACS
   replaces part of the original census (long form) in the 2010 decennial
   Census in the U.S. Reliability of estimates should be taken into
   account. when analyzing and mapping ACS data because these estimates are
   derived from surveys with sample sizes much smaller than those in the
   decennial censuses. Most maps using ACS data do not include data
   reliability information. In this article, we review the standard data
   quality or reliability information accompanying the ACS estimates. We
   propose a set of techniques to map ACS estimates by incorporating the
   margin of error (MOE) or related information either on the map display
   or in the mapping process. The techniques are proposed in two contexts:
   recognizing the varying degree of reliability among estimates, and
   determining if estimates are statistically different. They offer
   cartographers anti GIS users some options to map ACS estimates and
   handle the reliability information simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To investigate the relationships between cardiorespiratory
   fitness and adiposity among young children, and their influence on a
   comprehensive cardiovascular risk profile.
   Study design The sample included 95 healthy weight, 54 overweight, and
   31 obese children (n = 180, 10.9 +/- 2.1 years). All children had a
   medical assessment that included a physical examination and fasting
   investigations including glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol,
   high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides,
   insulin and glucose levels. Body mass index and waist circumference
   z-scores were calculated. Children's fitness level was measured with the
   Queens College step test.
   Results Although low fitness was independently associated with
   cardiovascular risk, multi-level analysis demonstrated that waist
   circumference z-score was the only significant predictor of
   cardiovascular risk factors including SBP (beta = 3.29, P <.001), DBP
   (beta = 1.88, P <.005), high-density lipoprotein (beta = -0.12, P
   <.001), and triglyceride levels (beta = 0.14, p <.001), fasting insulin
   (beta = 2.83, P <.001), C-peptide (beta = 0.11, P <.001), and HOMA-IR
   (beta = 0.34, P <.001), with increasing waist circumference z-score
   associated with increasing cardiovascular risk. Within the healthy
   weight children, high fitness was associated with significantly reduced
   triglyceride levels, and lower fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR.
   Conclusions Young children's health may be influenced more by body
   fatness, and in particular, the distribution of body fat than by
   cardiorespiratory fitness. However, within the healthy weight children,
   high fitness was associated with a favorable metabolic profile,
   suggesting that cardiorespiratory fitness may exert a protective effect
   on metabolic risk in children whose risk is not confounded by fatness.

Abstract = {{Catalytic steam reforming of glycerol, a by-product in biodiesel
   production, represents an attractive route to hydrogen. For the first
   time, the kinetics of the glycerol steam reforming reaction over a Pt/C
   catalyst was considered. Kinetic data, i.e., glycerol conversion vs.
   space time, were obtained experimentally by using a fixed-bed reactor
   and were analyzed by the integral method of analysis. It was found that
   in the studied ranges of temperature from 623 to 673 K and space time
   from 0.39 to 1.56 g h/mol the investigated reaction is of the
   first-order with respect to glycerol. The specific reaction rate
   constant at 673 K was determined to be 1.1.10(5) cm(3)/g(cat) h. The
   values of glycerol conversion predicted by the first-order kinetic model
   were in good agreement with those obtained experimentally. The increase
   in temperature, space time, and initial water/glycerol ratio caused the
   expected increase in hydrogen yield.}},

Abstract = {{Bistable populations of bacteria give rise to two or more subtypes that
   exhibit different phenotypes. We have explored whether the periodontal
   pathogen Porphyromonas gin givalis exhibits bistable invasive
   phenotypes. Using a modified cell invasion assay, we show for the first
   time that there are two distinct subtypes within a population of P. gin
   givalis strains NCTC 11 834 and W50 that display differences in their
   ability to invade oral epithelial cells. The highly invasive subtype
   invades cells at 10-30-fold higher levels than the poorly invasive
   subtype and remains highly invasive for approximately 12-16 generations.
   Analysis of the gingipain activity of these subtypes revealed that the
   highly invasive type had reduced cell-associated arginine-specific
   protease activity. The role of Arg-gingipain activity in invasion was
   verified by enhancement of invasion by rgpAB mutations and by inclusion
   of an Arg-gingipain inhibitor in invasion assays using wild-type
   bacteria. In addition, a population of Delta rgpAB bacteria did not
   contain a hyperinvasive subtype. Screening of the protease activity of
   wild-type populations of both strains identified high and low protease
   subtypes which also showed a corresponding reduction or enhancement,
   respectively, of invasive capabilities. Microarray analysis of these
   bistable populations revealed a putative signature set of genes that
   includes oxidative stress resistance and iron transport genes, and which
   might be critical to invasion of or survival within epithelial cells.}},

   a two-step model for the phase transition involving site ordering
   followed by displacement is not likely to be correct. We suggest that an
   interstitial solid solution of oxygen and octahedral vacancies exists,
   and that the observation of any omega-phase diffraction pattern of
   alloys of these metals at ambient temperature and pressure should be
   viewed as a potential sign of the presence of oxygen in the octahedral
   interstitial sites.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee can be defined as primary
   (non-traumatic) or secondary (post-traumatic). Both non-traumatic OA and
   post-traumatic OA have been described predominantly in the medial
   compartment of the knee. The objective of this study was to compare the
   location of structural radiographic changes in non-traumatic OA and
   post-traumatic OA. A non-traumatic cohort, consisting of 155 patients
   suffering from chronic knee pain without known major injuries, was
   compared with a post-traumatic cohort, consisting of 176 patients, all
   of whom had sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury while playing
   soccer. A standardized weight-bearing knee radiography of the
   tibiofemoral joint was performed. Joint space narrowing (JSN) and
   osteophytes were graded according to the radiographic atlas of the
   Osteoarthritis Research Society International. JSN and osteophytes were
   located predominantly in the medial compartment in the non-traumatic
   cohort. In the post-traumatic cohort, structural changes were evenly
   distributed between the lateral and the medial compartments. We were
   thus able to demonstrate radiological differences between post-traumatic
   and non-traumatic OA.}},

Abstract = {{Electrodeposition (ED) and chemical bath deposition (CBD) are both
   solution processing methods that assemble solid materials from
   molecules, ions, or complexes in solution. The reactions occur on solid
   surfaces to produce polycrystalline and epitaxial films, porous
   networks, nanorods, superlattices, and composites. Both methods can be
   used to produce metals, semiconductors, magnetic materials, and ceramics
   in a wide array of architectures. Because of the low processing
   temperatures (often near room temperature), the techniques are ideal for
   producing nanostructured materials and interfaces. The methods are not
   only inexpensive and relatively simple, but they can often produce
   materials and nanostructures that cannot be accessed in ultrahigh
   vacuum. For example, the shape and orientation can be tuned by
   controlling the pH or through solution additives. Also, in ED, the
   departure from equilibrium can be precisely controlled through the
   applied potential. This issue attempts to provide understanding of the
   growth mechanisms from the molecular to final structure - of interfacial
   electrochemical and CBD reactions. For example, the influence of
   solution additives and pH and the effect of external parameters such as
   the applied potential will be discussed. Practical applications of these
   films and nanostructures include photovoltaic/photoelectrochemical cells
   and chemical/magnetic sensors.}},

Abstract = {{A web-based, interactive system for the remote processing of imaging
   data sets (i.e., EUV, X-ray, and microwave) and the automated

   resolved, phenomena such as kink, sausage, and longitudinal propagating
   and standing waves. The system implements the methods of Periodmapping
   for pre-analysis, and Pixelized Wavelet Filtering for detailed analysis
   of the imaging data cubes. The system is implemented on the dedicated
   data-processing server http://pwf.iszf.irk.ru, which is situated at the
   Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, Irkutsk, Russia. Input data in
   the .sav, .fits, or .txt formats can be submitted via the local and/or
   global network (the Internet). The output data can be in the png, jpeg,
   and binary formats, on the user's request. The output data are
   periodmaps; narrowband amplitude, power, phase and correlation maps of
   the wave's sources at significant harmonics and in the chosen spectral
   intervals, and mpeg movies of their evolution. The system was tested by
   the analysis of the EUV and microwave emission from the active region
   NOAA 10756 on 4 May 2005 observed with TRACE and the Nobeyama
   Radioheliograph. The similarity of the spatial localization of
   three-minute propagating waves, near the footpoint of locally open
   magnetic-field lines determined by the potential-field extrapolation, in
   both the transition region and the corona was established. In the
   transition region the growth of the three-minute amplitude was found to
   be accompanied by the decrease in the line-of-sight angle to the

   thyroid cancer.
   Material and methods: The study group comprised 71 persons (47 females
   and 24 males aged 18-56), diagnosed and treated at Zaklad Medycyny
   Nuklearnej i Endokrynologii Onkologicznej Centrum Onkologii - Instytutu
   im. Marii Sktodowskiej-Curie, Oddzial w Gliwicach. All the patients had
   completed the first stage of treatment (medical examination at least two
   years after being diagnosed). Life satisfaction was graded with the Life
   Satisfaction Scale (E. Diener, R.A Emmons, R.J. Larson and S. Griffin,
   Polish adaptation Z. Juczynski) and level of hope with Cantril's Ladder.
   Results and conclusions: Life satisfaction and hope, as positive
   resources, are vital factors of personality and give zest for life as
   well as helping to set subsequent life goals. Most patients evaluate
   their life satisfaction and level of hope rather highly. The level of
   life satisfaction in the study group was 21.8 points on average, which
   corresponds to a value of 8 on the sten scale. Only 7\% of patients in
   the group showed low results in the SWLS test with marks below 4 points
   on the sten scale. The level of hope in the study group was also
   evaluated. It was found that 43.6\% of patients showed an optimistic
   attitude towards their health condition. A similar number of patients
   (43.6\%) find their future situation similar to their present one (test
   results at the value of 0). Only in 12.8\% was an unsatisfactory
   attitude towards their future reported. The problems of patients with
   negative attitudes towards their lives and future prospects will be
   presented in the context of family support.}},

Abstract = {{Cytokeratin (CK) 18 M30 antigen has been proposed as a diagnostic marker
   of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We studied serum CK18 M30
   antigen level and examined the correlations among CK18 and biological
   data, dietary intake, and plasma fatty acid composition in middle-aged
   Japanese males with (NAFLD; n=42) and without NAFLD) (control; n=35).
   NAFLD was diagnosed if subjects showed fatty liver on abdominal
   ultrasonography and their alcohol consumption was <20 g/d. They were
   also confirmed to have negative serological results for tests of
   autoimmune liver disease and hepatitis B and C. In the NAFLD group. body
   mass index, waist circumference. serum M30 antigen. alanine transaminase
   (ALT), cholinesterase, triacylglycerol. LDL-cholesterol, and HbA1c were
   significantly higher than in the control group. In the fatty acid
   analysis of plasma phospholipids, significantly higher
   dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), total saturated fatty acids (SPA),
   and palmitic/linoleic acid ratio as well as lower arachidonic acid/DGLA
   ratio were observed in the NAFLD group compared with the control group.
   In the NAFLD group. M30 antigen was correlated positively with serum
   ALT. plasma DGLA. dietary SFA, and serum TNF-alpha as determined by
   partial correlation analysis controlled for BMI. On the basis of
   multivariate regression analysis using a stepwise method, M30 antigen
   was significantly associated with ALT and plasma DGLA. Regarding the
   determinants of NAFLD as revealed by logistic regression analysis, a
   high odds ratio was observed for plasma DGLA. In conclusion, members of
   the NAFLD group showed higher levels of serum CK18 M30 antigen and M30
   antigen was strongly associated with serum ALT and plasma DGLA. Abnormal
   fatty acid metabolism may be a factor that causes aggravation of NAFLD.}},

Abstract = {{In climatology, one of the most important pieces of information about
   the climate of a place or a region is information about the
   Climatological Normals (CLINO)-the average values of meteorological
   elements for a 30-year period. This kind of information usually comes in
   tables and is available for different observation sites from national
   meteorological services or from World Meteorological Organisation
   publications. The key issue, then, becomes how to interpolate these
   values over the entire area of interest to get reliable and accurate
   estimates (maps) of climatic elements. Here, the regression kriging
   framework has been applied for mapping of 20 climatological parameters
   for the 1961-1990 period for the 56,594 km(2) of Croatian territory,
   with a resolution of 1 km. In total, 152 main and climatological and 567
   precipitation-measuring stations have been used in the analysis.
   Extensive pre-processing of metadata on station co-ordinates has been
   done, as well as completion of missing monthly averages. The final
   results are 20 climatological maps available in high resolution together
   with error maps and accuracy assessment measures.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochromic switchable mirror glass is expected to be implemented in
   new energy-saving windows, as it can switch between reflective and
   transparent states simply through an applied voltage. In its reflective
   state, it can effectively control the solar radiation coming into a
   room. However, conventional windows are often affected by environmental
   factors such as temperature and humidity. In this work, we investigated
   the effects of the environment on the optical switching properties of
   the mirror. In accelerated degradation studies, when the mirror was kept
   in a simulated environment with high temperature and high relative
   humidity controlled by a thermostat/humidistat bath, its optical
   switching properties degraded. After being kept for 34 days at a
   temperature of 30 degrees C and a relative humidity of 80\%, the mirror
   never showed its optical switching property. Moreover surface roughness
   increased up to R-a=13.1 nm, due to the degradation of the surface layer
   of the Mg4Ni thin film. The layer changed into a non-metallic state of
   oxide and hydroxide, as determined by the X-ray photoelectron
   microscopy. We confirmed that the mirror was significantly affected by
   the environment, especially by high relative humidity in the atmosphere,
   which caused rapid degradation of the mirror. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We introduce the liquid-liquid system to utilize both of the spatial and
   the temporal localized energy simultaneously by adding temporal
   localization to micro-fluidics. Liquid droplets in the gas phase
   confined in microchannels are used for spatial-temporal localization to
   realize various chemical processes. A highly accelerated droplet
   generates the high kinetic energy and momentum in the spatial
   localization. ``Rapid{''} collision caused by the highly accelerated
   droplet enables the spatial and temporal localization of the
   high-energy, which induces the conversion and transfer of the
   high-energy. We refer to this new microfluidics system as a ``micro
   droplet collider.{''} We fabricated launchers for the droplet shot,
   tracks for the droplet run, and a chamber for the collision between two
   droplets on a microchip based on gas-liquid Laplace pressure. The
   acceleration of the droplet to the high velocity (10(6) mu m s(-1);
   10(2) times faster velocity and 10(4) times higher energy than that of
   typical water-in-oil droplet format), rapid collision (<100 mu s) at a
   small interface between droplets were achieved. Inelastic and minimally
   deformable collision was conducted, which enabled the utilization of the
   localized high-energy efficiently. As one application to chemical
   processes, we demonstrated rapid mixing (0.5 s) between two droplets
   (volume ratio; 1 (0.25 nl):10), a process that has not been achieved
   yet. Mixing time was 6,000 times faster than that of molecular diffusive
   mixing by utilizing the localized high-energy. The developed micro
   droplet collider is expected to contribute greatly to microfluidics and
   chemical processes on a microchip.}},

Abstract = {{Let C be a closed and convex subset of a real Hilbert space H. Let T be
   a nonexpansive mapping of C into itself, A be an alpha-inverse
   strongly-monotone mapping of C into H and let B be a maximal monotone
   operator on H, such that the domain of B is included in C. We introduce
   an iteration scheme of finding a point of F(T) boolean AND (A + B)(-1)0,
   where F(T) is the set of fixed points of T and (A + B)(-1)0 is the set
   of zero points of A + B. Then, we prove a strong convergence theorem,
   which is different from the results of Halpern's type. Using this
   result, we get a strong convergence theorem for finding a common fixed
   point of two nonexpansive mappings in a Hilbert space. Further, we
   consider the problem for finding a common element of the set of
   solutions of a mathematical model related to equilibrium problems and
   the set of fixed points of a nonexpansive mapping.}},

Abstract = {{Cholangiocarcinoma is a particularly devastating carcinoma with limited
   treatment options. Tousled-like kinase 1 (TLK1) is a serine/threonine
   protein kinase that regulates DNA replication and DNA repair pathways.
   Here, we show that TLK1 is abundantly expressed in cholangiocarcinoma as
   well as in cell lines derived from cholangiocarcinoma. Although siRNA
   knockdown of TLK1 did not affect the viability of cholangiocarcinoma
   cells, it sensitized cholangiocarcinoma cells to cisplatin-induced
   apoptosis. Immunofluorescence analysis of gamma H2AX foci showed that
   silencing of TLK1 enhanced DNA damage induced by cisplatin treatment.
   Our results suggest that TLK1 plays a pivotal role for the repair of
   cisplatin-induced DNA damage. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An experimental study on the adhesion of thin films was conducted for

   interfacial delamination increases with the increases in the time of UV
   curing, indicating that the indentation method is efficient to examine
   the adhesion of coating. As the UV curing time increases, the film
   thickness and the Si-CH3 bond structure decrease, whereas the SiO2
   network structure develops and the mechanical properties of the film are
   improved. Furthermore, the energy release rate of SiOC film/Si
   interfacial delamination is well correlated in a proportional manner to
   the Young's modulus of the film.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to assess gender differences in
   diabetes-related vascular reactivity in murine aortas. Diabetes is a
   risk factor for ischemic heart disease, cerebral ischemia, and
   atherosclerosis, conditions in which endothelial dysfunction plays a
   pathogenetic role. We examined vascular responses in aortas isolated
   from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mice and age-matched
   control mice, and looked for gender differences in the diabetes-induced
   changes in these responses. For each gender, the plasma adiponectin
   levels were lower in diabetic mice than in the controls, and they were
   significantly higher in females than in males. The acetylcholine
   (ACh)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortic rings was
   impaired (vs. that in the age-matched controls) in diabetic male mice,
   but not in diabetic female mice. The sodium nitroprusside-induced
   endothelium-independent aortic relaxation was not altered by diabetes in
   either male or female mice. The norepinephrine-induced aortic
   contraction was enhanced (vs. that in the control group) in diabetic
   female mice, but not in diabetic male mice, whereas in the presence of
   N-G-nitro-L-arginine neither gender exhibited a significant
   diabetes-induced change in this contraction. The clonidine-induced and
   insulin-induced endothelium-dependent aortic relaxations were impaired
   only in the diabetic female group (vs. the age-matched controls). These
   results suggest that: a) in male diabetic mice, which exhibited low
   adiponectin levels, these were impairments of both the aortic relaxation
   and nitric oxide (NO) production induced by ACh, whereas b) in female
   diabetic mice, there were impairments of the aortic relaxations induced
   by both insulin and clonidine.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is induced by
   transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) after corneal wounding. This
   study addressed the role of the extracellular matrix in the induction of
   CTGF by TGF-beta.
   METHODS. Human corneal fibroblasts (HCFs) were grown on fibronectin
   (FN), vitronectin (VN), or collagen (CL) in supplemented serum-free
   media alone or with TGF-beta 1 or fibroblast growth factor plus heparin.
   CTGF mRNA was analyzed by qPCR and protein expression by Western blot
   analysis of Triton X-100 (TX-100)-soluble and TX-100-insoluble cell
   lysates using antibodies to N-terminal, mid, and C-terminal CTGF
   regions. Immunocytochemistry was performed on nonconfluent or
   scrape-wounded confluent HCFs.
   RESULTS. TGF-beta-treated HCFs grown on CL produced five times more
   38-kDa CTGF than untreated controls (72 hours). TGF-beta-treated HCFs on
   CL secreted twofold more CTGF than those on FN or VN. Furthermore, a
   31-kDa CTGF form, lacking the N-terminal domain, was detected in Triton
   X-100 insoluble fractions in Western blot analysis. Immunodetectable
   extracellular CTGF formed linear arrays parallel to, but not colocalized
   with, CL or FN. It also did not colocalize with FAK, vinculin, or
   integrins alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(5)beta(1). Intracellular CTGF was
   detected in the Golgi apparatus and vesicles, including endosomes.
   CONCLUSIONS. Enhanced CTGF secretion induced by TGF-beta in CL-grown
   cells may contribute to positive feedback in which CL is overexpressed
   in CTGF-induced fibrosis. N-terminal CTGF fragments in the plasma of
   patients with severe fibrotic disease may be a product of CTGF
   proteolysis that also produces the newly identified 31-kDa CTGF that
   remains cell associated and may have its impact by non-integrin
   signaling pathways. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2010;51:5002-5011)

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an exchangeable negative binomial distribution
   resulting from relaxing the independence of the Bernoulli sequence
   associated with a negative binomial distribution to exchangeability. It
   is demonstrated that the introduced distribution is a mixture of
   negative binomial distributions and can be characterized by infinitely
   many parameters that form a completely monotone sequence. The moments of
   the distribution are derived and a small simulation is conducted to
   illustrate the distribution. For data analytic purposes, two methods,
   truncation and completely-monotone links, are given for converting the
   saturated distribution of infinitely many parameters to parsimonious
   distributions of finitely many parameters. A full likelihood procedure
   is described which can be used to investigate correlated and
   overdispersed count data common in biomedical sciences and teratology.
   In the end, the introduced distribution is applied to analyze a real
   clinical data of burn wounds on patients. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{To elucidate the pathophysiologic changes in the kidney due to aging, we
   used physiological, morphometric, and imaging techniques to quantify GFR
   and its determinants in a group of 24 older (>= 55 years) compared to 33
   younger (<= 45 years) living donors. Mathematical modeling was used to
   estimate the glomerular filtration coefficients for the whole kidney
   (K-f) and for single nephrons (SNKf), as well as the number of filtering
   glomeruli (N-FG). Compared to younger donors, older donors had a modest
   (15\%) but significant depression of pre-donation GFR. Mean whole-kidney
   K-f, renocortical volume, and derived NFG were also significantly
   decreased in older donors. In contrast, glomerular structure and SNKf
   were not different in older and younger donors. Derived N-FG in the
   bottom quartile of older donors was less than 27\% of median-derived
   N-FG in the two kidneys of younger donors. Nevertheless, the remaining
   kidney of older donors exhibited adaptive hyperfiltration and
   renocortical hypertrophy post-donation, comparable to that of younger
   donors. Thus, our study found the decline of GFR in older donors is due
   to a reduction in K-f attributable to glomerulopenia. We recommend
   careful monitoring for and control of post-donation comorbidities that
   could exacerbate glomerular loss. Kidney International (2010) 78,

Abstract = {{In a thin elongated current sheet, it is likely that more than one
   X-line forms and thus multiple magnetic islands are produced. The
   islands are then subject to merging. By simulating such a case with a
   two-dimensional full-particle code, we show that a merger forming a
   large island produces the most energetic electron population in the
   system. By setting the lateral extent of the simulation box to be as
   large as similar to 100 ion inertial lengths, we introduce many (16)
   small islands in the initial thin current sheet (similar to 1 ion
   inertial length thickness). Merging of these islands proceeds to leave
   only two islands in the system. Then, strong electron acceleration is
   seen upon the final merger that produces the single island in the large
   simulation box. The most energetic electrons in the system are
   accelerated at the merging line. The merging line acceleration dominates
   because the reverse-reconnection facilitating the final merger is in
   such a strongly driven manner that the associated electric field is an
   order of magnitude larger than those available upon normal reconnection.
   Combining the results from additional runs enables us to obtain a
   scaling law, which suggests a non-negligible role played by merging
   lines in the observed electron acceleration phenomena. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of
   obesity on testicular function by evaluating reproductive hormones,
   inhibinB, insulin-like 3(INSL3), and leptin, in obese and non-obese
   adolescents according to pubertal Tanner stages.
   Design and methods: Eighty adolescent boys were grouped (n = 20) as;
   Group1 : obese-Tanner2, Group2: non-obese-Tanner2, Group3:
   obese-Tanner4, Group4: non-obese-Tanner4. Serum INSL3, luteinizing
   hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, total testosterone, free
   testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin, inhibin B and
   leptin levels were assessed in all groups.
   Results: INSL3 levels were significantly lower in obese adolescents
   compared to non-obese boys (p = 0.003, Tanner2) and (p = 0.031,
   Tanner4). There was a negative correlation between INSL3 and leptin (r =
   -0.468, p = 0.001). The negative correlation between INSL3 and BMISDS
   indicates that pubertal obesity leads to Leydig cell impairment.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated for the first time in the
   literature that obesity effects testicular Leydig cell function starting
   from Tanner stage 2. (C) 2010 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Title = {{Partial rootzone irrigation increases water use efficiency, maintains
   yield and enhances economic profit of cotton in arid area}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1527-1533}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Partial rootzone irrigation (PRI) can substantially reduce irrigation
   amount and has been demonstrated as a promising irrigation method for
   crops in arid or semiarid areas. Many earlier researches have shown that
   PRI reduces leaf transpiration by narrowing stomatal opening. In this
   study we verified the hypothesis that PRI can also save irrigation water
   by substantially reducing soil evaporation. Field experiment was
   conducted in an arid area where cotton production almost completely
   relies on irrigation. Water was applied to furrows in the cotton field
   either alternatively (AFI, alternative furrow irrigation), or evenly to
   all the furrows (CFI, conventional furrow irrigation), or to one fixed
   furrow in every two (FFI, fixed furrow irrigation). Our results show
   that surface evaporation constitutes a large fraction of the irrigation
   water loss from cropped field (more than 20\%), and with the two PRI
   treatments nearly 40\% of the evaporative water loss is saved.
   Transpiration accounted for 48\%, 58\% and 57\% of the total amount of
   irrigation respectively for the CFI, AFI and FFI treatments. This result
   suggests that PRI increases the proportion of applied water that is
   transpired, and therefore leads to a higher water use efficiency than
   regular irrigation. Overall, when irrigation was reduced by 30\%, the
   average final yield loss of AFI was only 4.44\%, a non-significant
   reduction statistically. The FFI had a significant reduction in yield of
   12.01\% in comparison to CFI. Moreover, PRI brings in earlier flowering
   and a higher economical return due to early harvested cotton. This
   indicates that the final economical output could compensate for the loss
   of cotton yield due to water-saving. With very little extra cost to
   implementation. PRI proves a very promising method in cotton production
   in arid zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{P>Sphingolipids play critical roles in many physiologically important
   events in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we screened for
   yeast mutants showing high sensitivity to Aureobasidin A, an inhibitor
   of inositol phosphorylceramide synthase, and found that a lack of SAC1
   encoding phosphoinositides phosphatase causes high sensitivity to the
   inhibitor. Double mutation analysis involving the SAC1 and non-essential
   sphingolipid-metabolizing enzyme genes revealed that csg1 Delta, csg2
   Delta, ipt1 Delta or scs7 Delta causes synthetic lethality with deletion
   of SAC1. As previously reported, SAC1-repressed cells exhibited a
   reduced cellular phosphatidylserine (PS) level, and overexpression of
   PSS1 encoding PS synthase complemented the growth defects of scs7 Delta,
   csg1 Delta and ipt1 Delta cells under SAC1-repressive conditions.
   Furthermore, repression of PSS1 expression resulted in synthetic growth
   defect with the deletion of CSG1, IPT1 or SCS7. The growth defects of
   scs7 Delta, csg1 Delta and ipt1 Delta cells under SAC1- or
   PSS1-repressive conditions were also complemented by overexpression of
   Arf-GAP AGE1, which encodes a protein related to membrane trafficking.
   Under SAC1-repressive conditions, scs7 Delta, csg1 Delta and ipt1 Delta
   cells showed defects in vacuolar morphology, which were complemented by
   overexpression of each of PSS1 and AGE1. These results suggested that a
   specific group of sphingolipid-metabolizing enzyme is required for yeast
   cell growth under impaired metabolism of glycerophospholipids.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: To determinate the etiology and risk factors for a first
   episode of cerebral ischemia in young adults at three hospitals of Lima
   and Callao-Peru.
   Methods: Multicentric study carried out at three national hospitals in
   Lima. The sample included 30 patients with a first episode of stroke and
   60 controls matched by age and sex 2:1 with the patients. Serum
   biochemistry studies, EKGs and echocardiograms were done. Etiologies
   were classified based on the classification of Baltimore-Washington
   Cooperative Young Stroke Study.
   Results: The most frequent etiologies were cardiac embolism and
   atherosclerotic valvular heart disease, which were 30\% of the cases (9
   patients) each one. Hypertriglyceridemia (p = 0.014), valvular heart
   disease (p = 0.001) and hormonal contraception/replacement therapy (p =
   0.002) were independent risk factors for a first episode of cerebral
   ischemia in peruvian young adults. Motor deficiency was the most
   frequent presentation (50.0\%). Intracraneal hypertension and urinary
   tract infection were the most frequent complications during acute
   ischemia and mortality was raised up to 10\%.
   Conclusions: The hypertriglyceridemia, valvular heart disease and the
   use of oral contraceptives are independent risk factors for a first
   episode of ischemia in young adults from three hospitals of Lima and
   Callao. The most frequent etiologies were cardiac embolism and
   atheroesclerotic valvular heart disease. (C) 2009 Sociedad Espanola de

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate BR55, a new VEGFR2-specific ultrasound contrast
   agent, for imaging prostate tumors in an orthotopic model in the rat.
   Materials and Methods: Rat prostate adenocarcinoma were established by
   injection of G Dunning R-3327 tumor cells in one lobe of the prostate of
   Copenhagen rats. Imaging experiments were performed with BR55, SonoVue,
   and streptavidin-functionalized microbubbles coupled with an
   anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) antibody
   using a clinical ultrasound scanner. Contrast enhancement in the tumor
   and healthy prostate was followed over time by intermittent imaging at
   low acoustic power. Signal quantification and statistical analysis were
   performed in the tumor and healthy tissue to compare the behavior of the
   3 contrast agents. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the prostate
   and tumor specimen to determine the expression of VEGFR2.
   Results: Comparable contrast enhancement was observed in tumors at peak
   intensity for BR55 and SonoVue. Then, once unbound microbubbles had
   cleared from the circulation, a strong enhancement of the tumor was
   obtained with BR55, whereas no significant microbubble accumulation was
   detected in the healthy prostate tissue. SonoVue microbubbles were
   rapidly eliminated, and no significant binding was observed in the
   tumor. The tumor to prostate ratio calculated after signal
   quantification was about 20 for the 3 doses of BR55 tested. The
   enhancement obtained with BR55 in the tumor was not significantly
   different from the one observed with antibody-coupled streptavidin
   microbubbles. Intense staining for VEGFR2 was detected in the tumor
   vessels by immunohistochemistry.
   Conclusions: This study showed that BR55 binding to prostate tumors
   resulted in a strong enhancement of the lesions as early as a few
   minutes after contrast injection, whereas minimal nonspecific
   accumulation occurred in the healthy part of the gland. BR55, like
   Sonovue, provide information on tissue perfusion during the early
   vascular phase, but BR55 binding to the tumoral endothelium allows to
   gain additional information by highlighting the sites of active
   angiogenesis. The late phase enhancement of the tumor should be
   particularly valuable for prostate cancer detection and for biopsy
   guidance.}},

Abstract = {{Cefaclor (CEF), a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic, possesses
   various donor sites for interaction with transition metal (II) ions such
   as Cu(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) to form complexes of the type {[}
   M(CEF)(H2O)Cl], with a molar ratio of metal: ligand (M: L) of 1:1. These
   complexes were prepared and characterized by physicochemical and
   spectroscopic methods. Their UV-Vis, IR and mass spectra suggest that
   CEF potentially acts as a bi-dentate ligand. The electrochemical
   behavior of these synthesized and in solution complexes is studied over
   glassy carbon electrode in various buffer solutions using cyclic, linear
   sweep, differential pulse (DP) and square wave (SW) voltammetric
   techniques. CEF enrichment is observed over Cu(II) complex. The peak
   current and peak potential of the complex depend on pH, initial
   potential, and scan rate. DP and SW voltammetric techniques were used
   for the determination of CEF-Cu(II) complex. For solid synthesis
   complex, the linear response was within 1x10(-6) - 3x10(-5) M with a
   detection limit on one decimal point: 2.26x10(-7) for DPV and
   2.30x10(-7) M for SWV techniques in acetate buffer at pH 4.70. The
   repeatability of the methods was within 0.82-0.78\% for peak potentials
   and 1.16-0.71\% for peak currents. All necessary validation parameters
   were investigated as detailed in all media. The complexes have been
   screened for antibacterial activity and results were compared with the
   activity of the uncomplexed antibiotic against Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
   Kluvyeromyces fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus,
   Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus megaterium, Candida
   albicans, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus cloacae
   and Micrococcus leteus. The copper complex was found to be more potent
   against two bacterial species than the uncomplexed CEF.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Many of the hypotheses have been suggested to explain the
   mechanism of the secondary effects of traumatic spinal cord injury
   (TSCI) as follows: ischaemia/reperfusion disability theory, free
   radicals theory, exitotoxicity theory, immunological destruction theory,
   apoptosis theory. Recently, free radicals, lipid peroxidation reactions
   and apoptosis theories have been much more accepted than others. In this
   study, possible protective effects of the alpha lipoic acid were
   evaluated in the traumatic spinal cord of rats.
   Methods: Using a well characterised weight drop technique, spinal cord
   contusions were formed to 48 Wistar albino rats at thoracal 8-10 level.
   After alpha lipoic acid and methylprednisolone were administered
   intraperitoneally, the spinal cord tissues were harvested for
   histopathological and biochemical studies.
   Results: Histopathological examination results showed that neither
   methylprednisolone nor alpha lipoic acid can play an act to decrease or
   block the neural tissue destruction and necrosis in hyperacute and
   subacute stage of the TSCI in rats. Biochemical study results showed
   that alpha lipoic acid was much more decreased the lipid peroxidation
   levels than methylprednisolone in subacute stage. However, none of the
   agents was changed the myeloperoxidation level in subacute stage.
   Interpretation: Alpha lipoic acid and methylprednisolone administrations
   did not alter the onset or degree of necrosis at the zone of the TSCI in
   rats. On the other hand, alpha lipoic acid is more effective than
   methylprednisolone treatment for the prevention of lipid peroxidation
   after spinal cord injury. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A method for measuring the distribution of electroosmotic flow velocity
   and electric field intensity in a microchannel by micro- particle image
   velocimetry (mu PIV) is described. Two types of particles with differing
   electric surface properties were used as tracer particles in order to
   subtract the velocity component due to the effects of the
   electrophoretic force from the velocity of the particles. A calibration
   experiment was first carried out using a one-dimensional microchannel to
   obtain the correlation functions between the apparent electric field
   intensity and the velocity of the two particles. mu PIV measurements
   were then carried out in the target microchannel to measure the
   electroosmotic flow and electric fields by using the same two tracer
   particles and the correlation function. To validate the present method,
   experiments were conducted for two types of microchannels. One was a
   straight channel that consisted of a material different from that used
   in the calibration, and the other was a corrugated channel. The results
   were compared with those of an experiment using fluorescent dye, as well
   as with numerical simulations. Good agreement was observed in both
   comparisons, affirming the validity of the proposed method.}},

   literacy requires focusing on the era in which cinema began Only by
   examining the 19(th) century more deeply can we perceive what lies
   beyond that invention of the Lumiere brothers The essay shows that

   current study examined whether social workers practicing in the area of
   children and families had education in genomics/genetics throughout
   their career, including continuing education, and the impact of that on
   their opinions about the use of genetic testing in adoption. A random
   selection of 1000 NASW members received the survey packet, which was
   completed and returned by 261 people (26\%). Of the respondents, the
   most recent social work graduates were no more likely to have had any
   education in genetics than those who graduated 25 or more years ago.
   Having received education was associated with more favorable opinions
   about the use of genetic testing in adoption. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The impact of climate change on hydrologic design and management of
   hydrosystems could be one of the important challenges faced by future
   practicing hydrologists and water resources managers. Many water
   resources managers currently rely on the historical hydrological data
   and adaptive real-time operations without consideration of the impact of
   climate change on major inputs influencing the behavior of hydrologic
   systems and the operating rules. Issues such as risk, reliability and
   robustness of water resources systems under different climate change
   scenarios were addressed in the past. However, water resources
   management with the decision maker's preferences attached to climate
   change has never been dealt with. This short paper discusses issues
   related to impacts of climate change on water resources management and
   application of a soft-computing approach, fuzzy set theory, for
   climate-sensitive management of hydrosystems. A real-life case study
   example is presented to illustrate the applicability of a soft-computing
   approach for handling the decision maker's preferences in accepting or
   rejecting the magnitude and direction of climate change. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This is the second of a series of articles reporting critically
   evaluated rotational-vibrational line positions, transition intensities,
   pressure dependences, and energy levels, with associated critically
   reviewed assignments and uncertainties, for all the main isotopologues
   of water. This article presents energy levels and line positions of the
   following singly deuterated isotopologues of water: (HDO)-O-16,
   (HDO)-O-17, and (HDO)-O-18. The MARVEL (measured active
   rotational-vibrational energy levels) procedure is used to determine the
   levels, the lines, and their self-consistent uncertainties for the
   spectral regions 0-22708, 0-1674, and 0-12 105 cm(-1) for (HDO)-O-16,
   (HDO)-O-17, and (HDO)-O-18, respectively. For (HDO)-O-16, 54 740
   transitions were analyzed from 76 sources, the lines come from spectra
   recorded both at room temperature and from hot samples. These lines
   correspond to 36 690 distinct assignments and 8818 energy levels. For
   (HDO)-O-17, only 485 transitions could be analyzed from three sources;
   the lines correspond to 162 MARVEL energy levels. For (HDO)-O-18, 8729
   transitions were analyzed from 11 sources and these lines correspond to
   1864 energy levels. The energy levels are checked against ones
   determined from accurate variational nuclear motion computations
   employing exact kinetic energy operators. This comparison shows that the
   measured transitions account for about 86\% of the anticipated
   absorbance of (HDO)-O-16 at 296 K and that the transitions predicted by
   the MARVEL energy levels account for essentially all the remaining
   absorbance. The extensive list of MARVEL lines and levels obtained are
   given in the Supplementary Material of this article, as well as in a
   distributed information system applied to water, W@DIS, where they can
   easily be retrieved. In addition, the transition and energy level

Abstract = {{P>Background and objective:
   Ingestion of the medicinal herb kava has been associated with
   hepatotoxicity. We aimed to compare two different quantitative methods
   of causality assessment of patients with assumed hepatotoxicity by the
   herb.
   Methods:
   We assessed causality in 26 patients from Germany and Switzerland, using
   two structured quantitative analytical methods: the system of Maria and
   Victorino (MV) and that of the Council for International Organizations
   of Medical Sciences (CIOMS). In all 26 patients, regulatory ad hoc
   evaluation had suggested a causal relationship between liver disease and
   kava use.
   Results and discussion:
   Assessment with the MV scale resulted in no or low graded causality for
   kava in the 26 patients with liver disease. Causality was probable (n =
   1), possible (n = 2), unlikely (n = 7), and excluded (n = 16). Causality
   for kava was more evident with the CIOMS scale: highly probable (n = 1),
   probable (n = 2), possible (n = 6), unlikely (n = 2) and excluded (n =
   15). However, the results of both quantitative causality assessments are
   not supportive for most of the regulatory ad hoc causality assessments
   of the 26 patients.
   Conclusion:
   Grades of causality for suspected hepatotoxicity by kava were much lower
   when evaluated by structured quantitative causality assessment scales
   than by regulatory ad hoc judgements. The quantitative CIOMS scale is
   the preferable tool for causality assessment of spontaneous reports of
   hepatotoxcity involving kava.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated long-term magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of Knee
   Osteochondral Autologous Transplantation (OAT)-Mosaicplasty and
   correlated MRI findings and clinical outcome. Twenty-four patients (mean
   age 29.9 +/- 8.7, 70.8\% male) undergoing arthroscopic OAT between 1997
   and 2000 were prospectively enrolled. The International Cartilage Repair
   Society (ICRS)/International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores
   and Tegner scores were employed for clinical evaluation. The magnetic
   resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) was utilized
   for description and assessment of the repair tissue. Median follow up
   was 113 months (interquartile range {[}IQR] 106-122). MRI showed good
   survival of grafted cartilage in 62.5\% of patients. The integration of
   the graft was complete in 75\% of cases, while the repaired tissue was
   intact in 62.5\% and had an homogeneous structure in 70.8\%. The MOCART
   score significantly correlated with objective and subjective scores (p =
   0.003 and p = 0.002). Contrastingly, overall MOCART showed no
   correlation with the Tegner score. MRI revealed to be a powerful tool
   for non-invasive long-term assessment of OAT. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Fireworks display during festive celebrations can cause acute short term
   air pollution. Deepawali -the festival of light- is celebrated in India,
   every year during October or November with great fireworks display.
   Concentration of air pollutants such as SPM (suspended particulate
   matter), PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and NO2 were monitored for six consecutive
   days during Deepawali in Salkia, a densely populated residential area
   near Kolkata, India, for assessing the impacts of fireworks on ambient
   air quality. The pollutant concentrations as recorded on Deepawali were
   found to be several times higher (6.44 times for SPM, 7.16 times for
   PM10, 5.35 times for PM2.5, 1.73 times for SO2 and 1.27 times for NO2)
   compared to a typical winter day value. The results indicated the huge
   contribution of fireworks on the pollutant levels. The particulate
   concentrations on Deepawali exceeded its respective 24 hour residential
   standards by several times (11.6 times for SPM, 22.3 times for PM10, and
   34.3 times for PM2.5). Concentrations of metals like Ba, Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg,
   Al in collected PM2.5 were found to be increased by many times on
   Deepawali (56.72, 79.00, 16.67, 14.86, 12.00 and 6.26 times,
   respectively) compared to the previous day. The probable health impact
   of this huge though short-lived deterioration of the ambient air quality
   is estimated through Monte Carlo's simulation in terms of increase in
   relative risk of mortality and morbidity in exposed individuals and
   found to be extremely high. It suggests some controls on fireworks
   during festive celebrations.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We sought to assess the evolution of Crohn's
   disease behavior in an American population-based cohort. METHODS:
   Medical records of all Olmsted County, Minnesota residents who were
   diagnosed with Crohn's disease from 1970 to 2004 were evaluated for
   their initial clinical phenotype, based on the Montreal Classification.
   The cumulative probabilities of developing structuring and/or
   penetrating complications were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
   Proportional hazards regression was used to assess associations between
   baseline risk factors and changes in behavior. RESULTS: Among 306
   patients, 56.2\% were diagnosed between the ages of 17 and 40 years.
   Disease extent was ileal in 45.1\%, colonic in 32.0\%, and ileocolonic
   in 18.6\%. At baseline, 81.4\% had nonstricturing nonpenetrating
   disease, 4.6\% had stricturing disease, and 14.0\% had penetrating
   disease. The cumulative risk of developing either complication was
   18.6\% at 90 days, 22.0\% at 1 year, 33.7\% at 5 years, and 50.8\% at 20
   years after diagnosis. Among 249 patients with nonstricturing,
   nonpenetrating disease at baseline, 66 changed their behavior after the
   first 90 days from diagnosis. Relative to colonic extent, ileal,
   ileocolonic, and upper GI extent were significantly associated with
   changes in behavior, whereas the association with perianal disease was
   barely significant. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based cohort study,
   18.6\% of patients with Crohn's disease experienced penetrating or
   stricturing complications within 90 days after diagnosis; 50\%
   experienced intestinal complications 20 years after diagnosis. Factors
   associated with development of complications were the presence of ileal
   involvement and perianal disease.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of extracts
   of Schleichera oleosa (Sapindaceae) for its cytotoxic and hydroxyl
   radical-scavenging activities. The bark of the tree was used to prepare
   extracts with different solvents (i.e., hexane, chloroform, ethyl
   acetate, methanol, and water). The extracts were initially assessed for
   their in vitro cytotoxicity potential in the sulforhodamine B dye assay
   against cell lines, such as 502713 (colon), SW-620 (colon), HCT-15
   (colon), A-549 (lung), HEP-2 (liver), SK-NS-H (central nervous system),
   and IMR-32 (neuroblastoma). It was observed that the water extract was
   effective against all the three colon cancer cell lines, while only
   methanol and water extracts were effective against A-549 (lung) and
   HEP-2 (liver), respectively. As DNA damage is one of the hallmarks of
   cell death, so the extracts were assessed for their ability to scavenge
   hydroxyl radicals, in the deoxyribose degradation assay (site-and
   nonsite specific) as well as their protective effect against the
   hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage in the plasmid nicking assay, using
   pBR322. It was observed that all the extracts, except chloroform and
   hexane, exhibited relatively greater antioxidant activity in the
   nonsite-specific than in the site-specific assay. Similarly, the
   extracts were also found to be effective in inhibiting the hydroxyl
   radical-induced unwinding of supercoiled DNA, which further confirmed
   the hydroxyl radical-scavenging ability of the extracts in the
   deoxyribose degradation method.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling parenting is associated with child anxiety however the
   direction of effects remains unclear. The present study implemented a
   Latin-square experimental design to assess the impact of parental
   control on children's anxious affect, cognitions and behaviour. A
   non-clinical sample of 24 mothers of children aged 4-5 years were
   trained to engage in (a) controlling and (b) autonomy-granting
   behaviours in interaction with their child during the preparation of a
   speech. When mothers engaged in controlling parenting behaviours,
   children made more negative predictions about their performance prior to
   delivering their speech and reported feeling less happy about the task,
   and this was moderated by child trait anxiety. In addition, children
   with higher trait anxiety displayed a significant increase in observed
   child anxiety in the controlling condition. The pattern of results was
   maintained when differences in mothers' levels of negativity and
   habitual levels of control were accounted for. These findings are
   consistent with theories that suggest that controlling parenting is a
   risk factor in the development of childhood anxiety. (c) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background
   Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic
   stem cell disorders with a high propensity to transform into acute
   myeloid leukemia. Heterozygous missense mutations in IDH1 at position
   R132 and in IDH2 at positions R140 and R172 have recently been reported
   in acute myeloid leukemia. However, little is known about the incidence
   and prognostic impact of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in myelodysplastic
   syndromes.
   Design and Methods
   We examined 193 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and 53 patients
   with acute myeloid leukemia arising from myelodysplastic syndromes for
   mutations in IDH1 (R132), IDH2 (R172 and R140), and NPM1 by direct
   sequencing.
   Results
   We found that mutations in IDH1 occurred with a frequency of 3.6\% in
   myelodysplastic syndromes (7 mutations in 193 patients) and 7.5\% in
   acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndromes (4 mutations
   in 53 patients). Three mutations in codon R140 of IDH2 and one mutation
   in codon R172 were found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia
   following myelodysplastic syndromes (7.5\%). No IDH2 R140 or R172
   mutations were identified in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
   The presence of IDH1 mutations was associated with a shorter overall
   survival (HR 3.20; 95\% CI 1.47-6.99) and a higher rate of
   transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (67\% versus 28\%, P=0.04).
   In multivariate analysis when considering karyotype, transfusion
   dependence and International Prognostic Scoring System score, IDH1
   mutations remained an independent prognostic marker in myelodysplastic
   syndromes (HR 3.57; 95\% CI 1.59-8.02; P=0.002).
   Conclusions
   These results suggest that IDH1 mutations are recurrent molecular
   aberrations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, and may become
   useful as a poor risk marker in these patients. These findings await

Abstract = {{Purpose: We sought to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of dual
   energy (DE) bone and plaque removal in head and neck CT angiography.
   Materials and methods: 20 patients with suspected carotid stenoses
   received head and neck DE-CTA as part of their pre-interventional
   workup. Visual grading using multiplanar reformations (MPR), thick slab
   maximum intensity projections (MIP) and quantitative vessel analysis
   (QVA) of stenoses was performed prior and after DE bone removal. Results
   were evaluated for the detection of relevant stenoses (vessel area
   reduction >70\%). Vessel segmentation errors were analyzed.
   Results: Segmentation errors occurred in 19\% of all vessel segments.
   Nevertheless, most post-bone removal artifacts could be recognized using
   the MPR technique for reading. Compared to MPR reading prior to bone
   removal, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
   values after bone removal were 100\%, 98\%, 88\% and 100\% for MPR
   reading and 100\%, 91\%, 63\% and 100\% for exclusive MIP reading,
   respectively. There was a good agreement between the QVA results prior
   and post-DE plaque removal (r(2) = 0.8858).
   Conclusion: DE bone and plaque removal for head and neck angiography is
   feasible and offers a rapid and highly sensitive overview over vascular
   head and neck studies. Due to a slightly limited specificity of the MIP
   technique due to segmentation errors, possible stenoses should be
   verified and graded using MPR techniques. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   L'Ensorcelee and Les Diaboliques depict a range of cruel attacks on the

   approach to violence, but also about the relationships between author,
   reader, and text that such representations of violence foreground. The
   notion of readerly pleasure theorized by Roland Barthes and linked to
   identity formation by Emma Wilson is associated with the witnessing or
   experiencing of pain in these texts. The reader is problematically
   positioned as both sadist, vicariously enjoying the suffering he or she
   is forced to witness, and masochist, taking pleasure in the authors'
   manipulations of them. These depictions of violated bodies ask whether
   and by what means violence can be represented in language, and this
   discussion leads to an analysis of the impact that such representations
   of violence have on the reader's experience of a text.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale, aims and objectives
   This paper applies the concepts of `adaptive leadership', as developed
   by Ron Heifetz, MD, to the practice of medicine.
   Methods
   Literature review and theory development.
   Results
   Patients are complex adaptive systems facing both adaptive and technical
   health challenges. Technical health challenges are amenable to the
   simple or complicated expert-mediated technical interventions that are
   common in modern medicine, but complex adaptive challenges can only be
   addressed by patients doing the adaptive work to learn new attitudes,
   beliefs and behaviours. In medicine, we often make the mistake of
   offering technical interventions in lieu of supporting patients'
   adaptive work. This error can result in poor clinical outcomes and
   wasted resources. Expecting simple or complicated technical `solutions'
   to resolve complex adaptive health challenges is a failure of adaptive
   leadership and violates Ashby's law of requisite variety. Adaptive
   leadership behaviours correspond to and complement doctor practices that
   have been shown to improve health outcomes and doctor-patient
   communication.
   Conclusions
   Adopting an adaptive leadership framework in the practice of medicine
   will require adaptive work on our part, but it promises to improve the
   doctor-patient relationship, increase our effectiveness as healers and
   reduce unnecessary health care utilization.}},

Abstract = {{20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH) control a variety of
   physiological events during insect development and metamorphosis. To
   understand how 20E and JH developmentally regulate energy metabolism in
   insects, we performed a genome-wide microarray analysis of fat body
   tissues isolated from the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Many genes involved in
   energy metabolism, including genes in the glycolytic pathway, were
   down-regulated during molting and pupation, when 20E levels are high.
   Notably, 20E treatment exhibited inhibitory effects on key glycolytic
   enzyme mRNA levels and activities, and RNA interference of the 20E
   receptor EcR-USP had the opposite effects to 20E treatment. Meanwhile,
   JH treatment stimulated both mRNA levels and activities of the key
   glycolytic enzymes, presumably via antagonizing the 20E action. Taken
   together, we conclude that 20E acts as a general blocker for glycolysis
   in the Bombyx fat body during molting and pupation, whereas the
   physiological role of JH is contrast with 20E during molting.}},

   concentrations of the 16 detected PBDE congeners were in the range of
   1.4 to 425 and 2.9 to 767 ng/g lipid for invertebrates and fish,
   respectively. The summed concentrations of the six major PBDE congeners
   (BDE-28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154) (Sigma 6PBDEs) in fish were
   significantly higher than in invertebrates, while demersal fish
   concentrations were higher than pelagic fish. The congeners BDE-47, 99,
   and 100 contributed more in viscera or liver than in muscle, indicating
   that the metabolic capability of the viscera or liver is greater than
   that of muscle. The ratio of BDE-47/99 was relatively higher in fish
   than in invertebrate samples, suggesting a more developed metabolism
   capacity in fish. Polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners tend to
   accumulate in viscera or liver rather than in muscle. The fully
   brominated congener BDE-209 was detected in some species, suggesting
   that it can be accumulated by organisms. Uptake from sediment may be the
   major uptake pathway for most brominated PBDEs in benthic species.

Abstract = {{In pursuit of the anticancer effects of seeds of the rain forest plant
   Bixa orellana (annatto), we found that its constituent cis-bixin induced
   cytotoxicity in a wide variety of tumor cell lines (IC50 values from 10
   to 50 mu M, 24-h exposures) and, importantly, also selectively killed
   freshly collected patient multiple myeloma cells and highly
   drug-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines. Mechanistic studies
   indicated that cis-bixin-induced cytotoxicity was greatly attenuated by
   co-treatment with glutathione or N-acetylcysteine (NAC); whereas
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) assays using the
   cell-permeable dyes 5-(and-6)
   chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester
   (CM-H(2)DCFDA), or dihydroethidium demonstrated that cis-bixin rapidly
   induced cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in dose-and
   time-dependent fashions, collectively implicating ROS as contributory to
   cis-bixin-induced cytotoxicity. In pursuit of potential contributors to
   ROS imposition by cis-bixin, we found that cis-bixin inhibited both
   thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) activities at
   concentrations comparable to those required for cytotoxicity,
   implicating the inhibition of these redox enzymes as potentially
   contributing to its ability to impose cellular ROS and to kill cancer
   cells. Collectively, our studies indicate that the annatto constituent
   cis-bixin has intriguing selective antimyeloma activity that appears to
   be mediated through effects on redox signaling. Antioxid. Redox Signal.

Abstract = {{Early-onset lung cancer diagnosed up to the age of 50 is a very rare
   disease, with an increasing incidence rate. Differences in aetiology,
   characteristics and epidemiology of early and older onset lung cancer
   have been described previously, suggesting the importance of genetic
   factors in early-onset lung cancer aetiology. A case-control study was
   conducted to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms in the
   MPO, EPHX1, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1 and NQO1 genes on the risk of
   early-onset lung cancer development. Six hundred thirty-eight Caucasian
   patients under the age of 51 with confirmed primary lung cancer and
   1,300 cancer free control individuals, matched by age and sex, were
   included in this analysis. Seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms and
   two deletion polymorphisms were genotyped. No significant association
   was found for any of the analyzed polymorphisms and overall lung cancer
   risk. Nonsignificantly decreased risk of lung cancer was observed for
   carriers of 1 or 2 copies of GSTM1. Subgroup analysis revealed gender-
   and/or smoking-specific effects of EPHX1 rs2854455 (IV-1464C > T) and
   rs2234922 (His139Arg), GSTT1 deletion, GSTP1 rs1695 (Ile105Val),
   rs947895 (+991C > A) and rs4891 (Ser185Ser) and NQO1 rs1800566
   (Pro187Ser) polymorphisms. However, none of the observed effects were
   confirmed by interaction tests nor were they significant after
   Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In summary, our study
   suggested a modifying effect of polymorphisms in EPHX1, GSTP1, GSTT1,
   GSTM1 and NQO1 genes on the risk of early-onset lung cancer. To confirm
   these observations and to eliminate possible bias in our analyses,
   larger studies are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need to standardise the numbering configuration of

   conflicting numbering schemes that may confuse operators of these varied

   of coloured indicator lights and coloured print lines designated for
   gamma and neutron alarms. In addition, second-party software that
   changes the alarm colour scheme may also have been installed.
   Furthermore, no provision exists for the colour blind or to provide work
   stations with only black ink on alarm printouts. These inconsistencies
   and confusing set-ups could inadvertently cause a misinterpretation of
   the alarm, resulting in the potential release of a radiological hazard
   into a sovereign country. These issues are discussed, and a proposed
   solution is offered.}},

Volume = {{77}},

Abstract = {{The timing of maturation in haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus was
   examined using changes in gonad development, follicle stimulating
   hormone beta (FSH-beta) transcript expression profile, growth and
   condition of 1 year old females held under a common environment between
   the summer and winter solstices. The circumnuclear ring, cortical
   alveolus and vitellogenic oocyte stages were first observed in August,
   October and November, respectively. FSH-beta transcript levels did not
   change significantly until September but increased markedly thereafter
   in maturing fish. A combined analysis of the mean oocyte diameter of the
   leading cohort, histological staging and FSH-beta transcript profile
   provided evidence of a commitment to maturation by October or November.
   Contrary to that previously proposed for gadoid species, histological
   analysis of field-caught immature M. aeglefinus during the spawning
   season indicated that cortical alveolar, rather than circumnuclear ring,
   stage oocytes provided definitive evidence of maturation. A decrease in
   relative liver size following the summer solstice suggested a possible
   link between energy status and maturation.}},

Abstract = {{Firewood can serve as a vector in the transport of non-native species,
   including wood-boring insects that feed within the wood and thus can be
   transported accidentally. Governments have enacted limitations on the
   movement of firewood in an effort to limit the anthropogenic movement of
   non-native species through, for example, recreational camping. Although
   the movement of invasive species through firewood is a documented
   invasion pathway, it is not trivial for governments to determine a
   ``safe{''} allowable distance for moving firewood. We were motivated by
   this challenge and developed a theoretical simulation to determine the
   campgrounds that could be potentially exposed to infested firewood based
   upon the hypothetical distribution of an invasive species and the
   allowable distance for moving firewood. We extend this concept to the
   known distributions of emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire
   (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) and Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora
   glabripennis (Motschulsky) Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). We illustrate,
   based upon theoretical and empirical observations, that as the
   distribution of an invasive species increases, more rigid constraints on
   the movement of firewood would be required relative to those species
   that are distributed over a smaller scale. Also, on the level of
   management within a state, smaller states have far less margin for error
   than larger ones, as even extremely rigid restrictions on the movement
   of firewood could have little management effect unless the infested area
   is spatially limited. These results collectively suggest the potential
   for a dynamic management strategy that adjusts allowable distances for
   firewood movement based upon the distribution of the non-native species.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we demonstrate a fully integrated three-axis Hall magnetic
   sensor by exploiting microfabrication technologies applied to a
   GaAs-based heterostructure. This allows us to obtain, by the same
   process, three mutually orthogonal sensors: an in-plane Hall sensor and
   two out-of-plane Hall sensors. The micromachined devices consist of a
   two-dimensional electron gas AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs multilayer which
   represents the sensing structure, grown on the top of an InGaAs/GaAs
   strained bilayer. After the release from the substrate, the strained
   bilayer acts as a hinge for the multilayered structure allowing the
   out-of-plane self-positioning of devices. Both the in-plane and
   out-of-plane Hall sensors show a linear response versus the magnetic
   field with a sensitivity for current-biased devices higher than 1000 V
   A(-1) T-1, corresponding to an absolute sensitivity more than 0.05 V T-1
   at 50 mu A. Moreover, Hall voltage measurements, as a function of the
   mechanical angle for both in-plane and out-of-plane sensors, demonstrate
   the potential of such a device for measurements of the three vector
   components of a magnetic field.}},

Abstract = {{Although drugs used in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) cause renal
   injury, glomerulopathies may also accompany IBD. We report a case with
   the rare association of ulcerative colitis (UC) and acute progressive
   interstitial nephritis. Although the kidney is acknowledged as a target
   organ for injury as a result of drug nephrotoxicity, our findings lend
   support to the novel recognition that the deranged autoimmune system
   emerging in UC causes interstitial nephritis as an extraintestinal
   manifestation. Overt renal failure due to interstitial nephritis has
   rarely been reported in UC patients. The case presented here therefore
   provides novel information on UC-associated nephropathy.}},

Abstract = {{Few in the history of surgery and just as few in the history of medicine
   can reach the level of clinical visibility as achieved by the Mayo
   brothers. The brothers changed the face of medicine while they were
   alive, and their fame and influence continued to grow after their death
   in 1939. The Mayo American surgical legacy had incredible proportions.
   The brothers systematically modified the field as few others had done
   before. They were great surgical innovators who took the surgical
   techniques of others and added a touch of their own to make the surgical
   procedure better and more secure. The Mayos were the stars regionally,
   nationally, and around the world. They attracted attention from their
   generation and occupied center stage long after. To speak of the Mayos
   is to speak of the quintessential American values of professionalism,
   respect, commitment, and caring for their fellow human beings. Their
   creation, the Mayo Clinic, surpassed the wildest hopes and predictions
   that anyone could have had regarding their best dreams.}},

Abstract = {{The linear attenuation coefficients for normal (adipose and glandular)

   monoenergetic X-ray beams at the energy range of 8-30 key, combining
   narrow beam geometry and high energy resolution obtained using a
   diffracted X-ray beam. The measured values are compared with predicted
   ones calculated according to the mixture rule and with previous
   experimental data showing a good agreement within the experimental
   uncertainties. Our results show that there is some degree of overlap
   among glandular, benign and malignant values. Nevertheless, significant
   differences (p < 0.05) exist in the linear attenuation coefficient
   between glandular and malignant at energies below 28 keV. Finally, a
   fitting procedure was applied to values for each group (mean and

Abstract = {{The genetic component of colorectal cancer (CRC) predisposition has been
   only partially explained. We recently suggested that a subtle decrease
   in the expression of one allele of the TGFBR1 gene was a heritable
   quantitative trait predisposing to CRC. Here, we refined the
   measurements of allele-specific expression (ASE) of TGFBR1 in a
   population-based series of CRC patients and controls. Five
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3'-untranslated region of
   the gene were genotyped and used for ASE determination by
   pyrosequencing. After eliminating non-informative samples and samples
   with RNA of insufficient quality 109 cases and 125 controls were
   studied. Allelic ratios ranged between 0.74 and 1.69 without evidence of
   bimodality or cutoff points for `ASE' versus `non-ASE'. Treating ASE as
   a continuous variable, cases had non-significantly different values than
   controls (P = 0.081 when comparing means by permutation test). However,
   cases had significantly higher ASE values when comparing medians by
   permutation test (P = 0.0027) and when using Wilcoxon test (P = 0.0094).
   We conclude that with the present-day technology, ASE differences
   between individuals and between cases and controls are too subtle to be
   used to assess CRC risk. More advanced technology is expected to resolve
   this issue as well as the low informativity caused by the limited
   heterozygosity of transcribed SNPs.}},

Abstract = {{An important solid-solid phase change heat storage material (PCM)
   2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol was investigated by calorimetric
   methods. The molar heat capacities of the compound were measured in the
   temperature range from 78 to 405 K by means of a small sample automated
   adiabatic calorimeter. A solid-solid and solid-liquid phase transitions
   were found at T = 351.598 K and 380.633 K. respectively, from the
   experimental C-p-T curve. The molar enthalpies and entropies of these
   transitions were determined to be 24.33 +/- 0.02 kJ mol(-1), 69.20 +/-
   0.07 J K-1 mol(-1) for the solid-solid phase transition and 4.01 +/-
   0.01 kJ mol(-1), 10.52 +/- 0.01 J K-1 mol(-1) for the solid-liquid phase
   transition, respectively. The thermodynamic functions (H-T-H-298.15) and
   (S-T-S-298.15), were derived from the heat capacity data in the
   temperature range of 78-405 K with an interval of 5 K. A precise
   oxygen-bomb combustion calorimeter was used to obtain the standard molar
   enthalpy of combustion and the standard molar enthalpy of formation,
   Delta H-c(m)0 (C5H11NO2, Cr) = ( -3326.25 +/- 0.52) kJ mol(-1) and Delta
   H-f(m)0 (C5H11NO2, Cr) = (-213.37 +/- 0.86) kJ mol(-1). DSC and TG tests
   were performed to investigate the solid-solid and solid-liquid phase
   transition behaviors and its thermostability. The results were in
   agreement with those obtained from heat capacity measurements, which
   indicated that 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol possesses typical
   solid-solid phase change material characteristics, such as, suitable
   transition temperature, high transition enthalpy and good thermal
   stability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread zoonotic pathogen capable of causing
   serious disease in humans and animals. As an obligate intracellular
   parasite, T. gondii relies on the orchestrated secretion of proteins
   from its apical complex organelles including the multimodular,
   transmembrane micronemal protein 2 (MIC2) that couples recognition of
   the host cell with cytoskeletal reorganization of the parasite to drive
   invasion. To probe the basis by which the von Willebrand Factor A
   (vWA)-Integrin like module of TgMIC2 engages the host cell, we solved
   the crystal structure of a truncated form of TgMIC2A/I (TgMIC2A/Ic)
   phased by iodide SIRAS and refined to a resolution of 2.05 angstrom. The
   TgMIC2A/Ic core is organized into a central twisted beta sheet flanked
   by a-helices consistent with a canonical vWA fold. A restricted basic
   patch serves as the putative heparin binding site, but no heparin
   binding was detected in native gel shift assays. Furthermore, no metal
   was observed in the metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS).
   Structural overlays with homologous A/I domains reveal a divergent
   organization of the MIDAS beta 4-alpha 4 loop in TgMIC2A/Ic, which is
   stabilized through the burial of Phe195 into a deep pocket formed by
   Gly185. Intriguingly, Gly185 appears to be unique among A/I domains to
   TgMIC2A/I suggesting that the divergent loop conformation may also be
   unique to TgMIC2A/I. Although lacking the C-terminal extension, the
   TgMIC2A/Ic structure reported here is the first of an A/I domain from an
   apicomplexan parasite and provides valuable insight into defining the
   molecular recognition of host cells by these widespread pathogens.}},

   dehydroaromatization (MDA) over Mo and W catalysts supported on HZSM-5.
   The effects of preactivation of the catalysts and the use of
   methane/hydrogen cycles on the catalytic activity and stability have
   been investigated. It was found that the activity was directly related
   to Bronsted sites on the external surface of HZSM-5 and the regeneration
   of these sites can augment the conversion in the MDA reaction. Moreover,
   the use of methane/hydrogen cycles removed a fraction of the coke formed
   during the reaction and improved the catalytic stability.}},

Abstract = {{The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid
   disorders characterised by impaired peripheral blood cell production due
   to bone marrow dysplasia affecting one or more of the major myeloid cell
   lines. MDS are one of five major categories of myeloid neoplasms
   according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system
   for haematological cancers. Given their cytological and cytogenetic
   heterogeneity, these diseases probably constitute a group of molecularly
   distinct entities with variable degrees of ineffective haematopoiesis
   and susceptibility to leukaemic transformation. Recent studies provide
   some insights into the physiopathology of MDS. In the early stages, one
   mechanism contributing to hypercellular marrow and peripheral blood
   cytopenia is a significant increase in programmed cell death (apoptosis)
   in haematopoietic cells. Furthermore, altered responses in relation to
   cytokines, the immune system and bone marrow stroma also contribute to
   the disease phenotype. Deletions of chromosome 5q31-q32 are the most
   common recurring cytogenetic abnormalities detected in MDS. The 5q-
   syndrome is a new entity recognised in the WHO classification since 2001
   and is associated with a good prognosis. Haploinsufficiency of multiple
   genes mapping to the common deleted region at 5q31-32 may contribute to
   the pathogenesis of 5q- syndrome and other MDS with 5q- deletion. Many
   studies have demonstrated that altered DNA methylation and histone
   acetylation can alter gene transcription. Abnormal methylation of
   transcription promoter sites is universal in patients with MDS, and the
   number of involved loci is increased in high-risk disease and secondary
   leukaemias. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of MDS can
   contribute to the development of new treatments such as hypomethylating
   drugs, immunomodulatory agents such as lenalidomide, and
   immunosuppressive drugs aimed at reversing the specific alteration that
   results in improvement in patients with MDS.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a novel method based on the instantaneous autocorrelation
   function (IACF) is proposed to determine the time evolution of the
   linear stability parameters of a boiling water reactor (BWR) using
   neutronic noise signals. The IACF allow us to track the instantaneous
   signal envelope changes in time by defining an envelope instantaneous
   decay ratio (EIDR) which is used as a measure of local stability. In
   order to account for long-term changes in BWR stability, the accumulated
   envelope-based decay ratio (ACEDR) measure is introduced as the product
   of the local EIDRs. As it is shown in this paper, the ACEDR measure
   clearly reflects major long-term changes in BWR stability. Last the
   natural resonant frequency of the nuclear reactor is estimated from the
   Fourier transform of a weighted version of the IACF called generalized
   local autocorrelation function (GLACF). In order to validate our method,
   synthetic and real neutronic signals were used. The methodology was
   tested on the Laguna Verde Unit 1 and three events reported in the
   Ringhals stability benchmark. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Hemophilia A is caused by a deficiency in blood coagulation Factor (F)
   VIII. Treatment for acute bleeding in patients comprises prophylactic
   infusion with human plasma-derived (pd) or recombinant (r)FVIII to
   increase circulating FVIII levels. However, alloantibodies (inhibitor)
   may arise in patients, limiting the efficacy of replacement therapy,
   especially in patients who develop high-titer inhibitors. For these
   patients, FVIII-bypassing agents are proposed, but there is a rare risk
   of thrombotic events. Porcine pdFVIII successfully achieves hemostatic
   FVIII levels in patients in whom human FVIII was ineffective, but
   possible residual viral contamination and immunogenicity prevents
   routine use. OBI-1, being developed by Ipsen and Inspiration
   Biopharmaceuticals Inc, is a bioengineered form of porcine rFVIII that
   is highly purified. OBI-1 has the procoagulant and biochemical
   properties of porcine pdFVIII, with improvements in risk of toxicity,
   infection and ease of manufacture. OBI-1 demonstrated significantly less
   immunogenicity than pdFVIII in a murine model of hemophilia A. Moreover,
   in cynomolgus monkeys, OBI-1 did not generate detectable inhibitors.
   OBI-1 was effective in a phase II, open-label clinical trial in patients
   with hemophilia A and inhibitor against porcine FVIII, who were
   experiencing a non-life or -limb threatening bleed. OBI-1 was well
   tolerated, without drug-related serious adverse events and is promising
   for further studies.}},

Abstract = {{In order to increase the permeability of cell membranes for low doses of
   cytostatic drugs, two bioelectrochemical methods have been compared: (a)
   electric pore formation in the plasma membranes by single electric
   impulses (electroporation), and (b) reordering of membrane structure by
   alternating currents (capacitively coupled). These treatments were
   applied to human leukemic K-562 cells and human lymphoma U-937 cells,
   yielding apoptotic and necrotic effects, determinated by flow cytometry.
   Additional cell death occurs after exposure to light irradiation at
   wavelengths lambda>600 nm, of cells which were electroporated and had
   incorporated actinomycin-C or daunomycin (daunorubicine). It is observed
   that drug uptake after an exponentially decaying electroporation pulse
   of the initial field strength Eo= 1.4 kV/cm and pulse time constants in
   the time range 0.5-3 ms is faster than during PEMF-treatment, i.e.,
   application of an alternating current of 16 kHz, voltage U< 100 V, I =
   55 mA, and exposure time 20 min. However, at the low ac. voltage of this
   treatment, more apoptotic and necrotic cells are produced as compared to
   the electroporation treatment with one exponentially decaying voltage
   pulse. Thus, additional photodynamic action appears to be more effective
   than solely drugs and electroporation as applied in clinical
   electrochemotherapy, and more effective than the noninvasive pulsed
   electromagnetic fields (PEMEs), for cancer cells in general and animals
   bearing tumors in particular. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{A Call to Action for Evidence-Based Military Women's Health Care:
   Developing a Women's Health Research Agenda That Addresses Sex and

Abstract = {{Women in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines are serving in complex
   occupational specialties that sustain national policy and ensure combat
   effectiveness of our forces. Their roles have evolved from supportive
   roles during early conflicts to active roles in combat support and
   counterinsurgency operations today. Although women have received
   military health care over the past three decades, sex- and
   gender-specific care has been limited to reproductive needs and has
   rarely addressed military-specific health risks and outcomes. The
   complexity of military jobs and increased deployments to combat
   operations has led to increased occupational and health risks for women.
   As differences have been noted between men and women's
   deployment-related health outcomes, it is incumbent on the Military
   Health Care System (MHS) to create an evidence base that addresses sex
   and gender differences in the health of its service members. A working
   group of military women's health advanced practice nurses (APN) and
   research experts proposes to address this gap in knowledge and practices
   through sex- and gender-specific research. A sex-and gender-based
   research agenda for military women's health will be a valuable
   instrument to those who are dedicated to the health of this population,
   including members of the Army, Navy, and Air Force military nursing
   community. Using the knowledge that the research agenda generates,
   military health care providers can develop clinical practice guidelines,
   influence policy, and participate in program development to improve the
   health of servicewomen. Shaping a sex- and gender-specific military
   women's health research agenda will create the foundation for future
   evidence-based care.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To test the microablation of excess graft choroidal tissue with the
   pulsed electron avalanche knife (PEAK-fc) in an in-vitro model of
   autologous retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-echoroid translocation.
   Methods Choroidal tissue of porcine RPE-choroid explants was ablated
   with the PEAK-fc. Tissue morphology was assessed by light microscopy
   (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The amount of ablated
   choroidal tissue was analysed as a function of three PEAK-fc parameters:
   (1) amplitude of biphasic voltage (70-100\%); (2) distance between
   choroidal tissue and tip of the PEAK-fc (0-300 mu m); and (3) exposure
   time (2-8 s).
   Results LM and SEM showed a smooth plain within the ablation area with
   well defined cutting edges and preserved adjacent tissue structure. The
   mean amount of ablated tissue correlated linearly with applied voltage
   (range 79-120 mm, r=0.34) and distance between choroidal tissue and
   PEAK-fc tip (range 10-100 mu m, r=0.74). The mean amount of ablated
   tissue increased with exposure time between 2 and 4 s (36-88 mu m,
   r=0.4) and remained constant between 4 and 8 s.
   Conclusion The PEAK-fc accurately microablates choroidal tissue
   in-vitro. The adjacent choroidal tissue structure and Bruch's membrane
   are preserved. Patient studies are required to test the PEAK-fc in
   RPE-choroid translocation surgery.}},

Abstract = {{P>The dynamics of all ecosystems are dictated by intrinsic,
   density-dependent mechanisms and by density-independent environmental
   forcing. In spite of the importance of the gastrointestinal microbiota
   in health and disease, the ecology of this system remains largely
   unknown. Here, we take an ecological approach to gut microbial community
   analysis, with statistical modelling of time series data from
   chemostats. This approach removes effects of host forcing, allowing us
   to describe a network of intrinsic interactions determining the dynamic
   structure of an experimental gut microbiota. Surprisingly, the main
   colonization pattern in this simplified model system resembled that of
   the human infant gut, suggesting a potentially important role of
   density-dependent interactions in the early gut microbiota. Knowledge of
   ecological structures in microbial systems may provide us with a means
   of controlling such systems by modifying the strength and nature of
   interactions among microbes and between the microbes and their
   environment.}},

Volume = {{176}},

Abstract = {{In the 1960s and 1970s, Hilary Putnam articulated a notion of
   relativized apriority that was motivated to address the problem of
   scientific change. This paper examines Putnam's account in its
   historical context and in relation to contemporary views. I begin by
   locating Putnam's analysis in the historical context of Quine's
   rejection of apriority, presenting Putnam as a sympathetic commentator
   on Quine. Subsequently, I explicate Putnam's positive account of
   apriority, focusing on his analysis of the history of physics and
   geometry. In the remainder of the paper, I explore connections between
   Putnam's account of relativized a priori principles and contemporary
   views. In particular, I situate Putnam's account in relation to analyses
   advanced by Michael Friedman, David Stump, and William Wimsatt. From
   this comparison, I address issues concerning whether a priori scientific
   principles are appropriately characterized as ``constitutive{''} or
   ``entrenched{''}. I argue that these two features need to be clearly
   distinguished, and that only the constitutive function is essential to
   apriority. By way of conclusion, I explore the relationship between the
   constitutive function a priori principles and entrenchment.}},

Abstract = {{Dependence of the surface electric conductivity of the layered
   Au/Si(111)5.55 x 5.55-Cu structure on the thickness of Au film and
   exposure in oxygen has been studied using low-energy electron
   diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy, and four-point-probe
   conductivity measurements. The samples were obtained by depositing Au
   (1-5 monolayers, ML) in vacuum at room temperature onto preliminary
   prepared Si(111)5.55 x 5.55-Cu surface, after which the structure was
   kept in oxygen (to a total exposure varied within 0-14000 L) at room
   temperature. It is established that the increasing oxygen exposure of
   both the initial and Si(111)5.55 x 5.55-Cu surface and that coated with
   gold to 1-3 ML leads to a significant decrease in the surface
   conductivity of samples. In contrast, the conductivity of samples coated
   with more than 3 ML of gold remains almost unchanged, which is explained
   by the fact that a continuous Au film is formed in this case on the
   Si(111)5.55 x 5.55-Cu surface.}},

Abstract = {{In vitro studies with keloid fibroblasts frequently present
   contradictory results. This may occur because keloids present distinct
   genotypic and phenotypic characteristics in its different regions, such
   as the peripheral region in relation to the central region. We suggest
   an explant model for keloid fibroblasts harvesting, standardising the
   initial processing of keloid samples to obtain fragments from different
   regions, considering its biological differences, for primary cell
   culture. The different keloid regions were delimited and fragments were
   obtained using a 3-mm diameter punch. To remove fragments from the
   periphery, the punch was placed in one longitudinal line extremity,
   respecting the lesion borders. For the central region, it was placed in
   the intersection of lines at the level of the largest longitudinal and
   transversal axes, the other fragments being removed centrifugally in
   relation to the first one. Primary fibroblast culture was carried out by
   explant. Flow cytometry analysis showed cell cycle differences between
   the groups, confirming its different origins and biological
   characteristics. In conclusion, our proposed model proved itself
   efficient for keloid fibroblast isolation from specific regions and
   cultivation. Its simplicity and ease of execution may turn it into an
   important tool for studying the characteristics of the different
   keloid-derived fibroblasts in culture.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Data from rodent models indicate that invariant natural
   killer T (iNKT) cells are key regulators of many immune responses
   including autoimmune arthritis, but their role in human diseases is
   unclear. The aims of this study are to determine whether iNKT cell
   frequency and function are altered in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
   (RA), and the clinical significance of such iNKT cell abnormalities.
   Methods Peripheral blood iNKT cell frequency and proliferative response
   to an iNKT cell-specific agonist, a-galactosylceramide were measured in
   46 RA patients (including 23 untreated, newly diagnosed patients), 22
   healthy controls and 27 patients presenting with recent-onset joint
   pain. The relationship between iNKT cell frequency and clinical
   characteristics and the effects of immunosuppressive treatment was
   examined.
   Results Compared with healthy controls, RA patients had a decreased
   frequency of peripheral blood iNKT cells (median 0.001\% vs 0.021\%, p <
   0.001) and the proliferative response of this subset to
   a-galactosylceramide was also diminished in the patient group (median
   fold-expansion 31 vs 121, p = 0.037). These abnormalities preceded the
   initiation of disease-modifying or immunosuppressive therapy, whose
   effect was to increase the circulating iNKT cell frequency (p = 0.037).
   Furthermore, iNKT cell frequency correlated inversely with the systemic
   inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (p = 0.008). Finally, in
   patients presenting with recent-onset joint symptoms, normal peripheral
   blood iNKT cell frequency predicted a non-inflammatory cause of joint
   pain.
   Conclusion iNKT cell deficiency is present in patients with RA and other
   inflammatory arthropathy. Normal iNKT cell frequency predicts
   non-inflammatory causes of joint pain.}},

Abstract = {{P>Responses to host amyloids and curli amyloid fibrils of Escherichia
   coli and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium are mediated through
   Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2. Here we show that TLR2 alone was not
   sufficient for mediating responses to curli. Instead, transfection
   experiments with human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells and
   antibody-mediated inhibition of TLR signalling in human macrophage-like
   (THP-1) cells suggested that TLR2 interacts with TLR1 to recognize curli
   amyloid fibrils. TLR1/TLR2 also serves as a receptor for tri-acylated
   lipoproteins, which are produced by E. coli and other Gram-negative
   bacteria. Despite the presence of multiple TLR1/TLR2 ligands on intact
   bacterial cells, an inability to produce curli amyloid fibrils markedly
   reduced the ability of E. coli to induce TLR2-dependent responses in
   vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our data suggest that curli amyloid
   fibrils from enterobacterial biofilms significantly contribute to
   TLR1/TLR2-mediated host responses against intact bacterial cells.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we numerically optimize the triggering time of several
   discrete heaters attached to a channel in forced convection. The flow is
   assumed laminar and fully developed and the strength of each dissipating
   heat source is determined by a sinusoidal function of time having a
   phase lag (phi) and a frequency (omega). The objective of this work
   summarizes to numerically determine an optimal set of activation phase
   lag and position for each heater, such that minimal thermal resistance
   is achieved for the system. The calculations were performed using a
   finite volume numerical code. The temperature history in any point of
   the channel was decomposed as a combination of steady-state and two
   harmonic components leading to a linear system of differential
   equations. The optimization procedure relied on a genetic algorithm,
   which was coupled to the numerical code implemented. The optimized
   results show that the activation phase lag and position of each heater
   can significantly decrease the overall thermal resistance. The designs
   optimized with respect to phase lags are relatively insensitive to
   frequency. The numerical results were found to qualitatively agree with
   the scale analysis proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive malignant brain
   tumor. Despite some recent improvement in the treatment of this
   malignancy, life expectancy of GBM patients remains extremely low.
   Therefore, continuous efforts to develop new treatment modalities are
   mandatory. A novel approach to cancer treatment is the use of targeted
   treatments, alone and in combination with other therapies. In this
   study, we evaluated the effects of novel combinations of conventional
   anti-cancer treatments (temozolomide or irradiation) with the targeted
   drug, imatinib, or with psychotropic drugs, belonging to the selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and phenothiazine subclasses, as
   well as combination of imatinib with psychotropic agents, on a human U87
   glioblastoma cell line. The combination of temozolomide with imatinib or
   the psychotropic drugs resulted in an additive anti-proliferative
   effect, while the combination of irradiation and the psychotropic agents
   resulted in a less than additive effect on cell proliferation. A marked
   synergistic anti-proliferative effect of imatinib combined with the
   psychotropic drugs fluoxetine, sertraline or perphenazine was
   demonstrated. None of the single or combined treatments led to a
   reduction in the expression of phosphorylated MAP kinase. However, a
   marked synergistic reduction in the expression of the key regulatory
   molecule, pAKT, was detected, following the combined treatment of the
   cells with the imatinib/psychotropics combination. This down-regulation
   of pAKT may mediate the synergistic anti-proliferative interaction of
   imatinib with the psychotropic agents. Although the concentrations of
   the psychotropic agents used in this and other in vitro studies were
   beyond the clinically relevant blood levels in humans, recent studies
   have demonstrated anti-proliferative effects in vivo, using sertraline
   in a human colon cancer model. Thus, it seems that further in vivo
   studies combining imatinib with psychotropic agents, especially
   fluoxetine and sertraline, are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This multihospital study determined the contributors to
   patient/family satisfaction levels with nurses' call light
   responsiveness and compared the reasons for call light usage as
   perceived by patients and nurses.
   Background: Delayed responses to answering call lights may result in a
   patient falling and can affect patient satisfaction.
   Methods: This cross-sectional survey study was conducted from September
   2008 to November 2009 in 4 US hospitals; 1,253 patients/family
   participants and 988 nurses were surveyed. Descriptive and multiple
   regression analyses were conducted.
   Results: Women, older patient/family participants, and those who
   perceived that nurses often answered call lights in person, that their
   problems were resolved after pushing the call light, and that their call
   lights less frequently involved safety issues were more satisfied with
   nurses' responsiveness. The top 5 reasons for using call lights were the
   same for patients and nurses.
   Conclusion: Nursing administrators should emphasize increasing staff's
   call light responsiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Foodborne outbreaks caused by noroviruses (NoVs) and hepatitis A virus
   (HAV) are often linked to consumption of contaminated shellfish. The
   objective of this study was to identify an appropriate virus recovery
   method for real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR detection and
   subsequently to evaluate this method on shellfish bioaccumulated with
   virus in a collaborative study. Five methods were compared for recovery
   of NoV GII.7 and feline calicivirus from spiked digestive tissue of
   oysters and mussels. A method based on proteinase K digestion followed
   by NucliSENS miniMAG extraction was found to be the most efficient with
   a 50\% limit of detection (LOD50) of 62 and 12 RT-PCR U/1.5 g digestive
   tissue for NoV GII.7 in oysters and mussels, respectively. Evaluation of
   the method in four laboratories found the percentage of sensitivity,
   based on low/high levels of virus bioaccumulated in oysters, to be 33/80
   for NoV GI.3b, 13/92 for NoV GII.4 and 50/42 for HAV. A specificity of
   100\% was found for all three viruses in non-bioaccumulated oysters. As
   process control Mengovirus (vMC(0)) showed an average recovery of 1.8\%
   from oysters and 1.2\% from mussels. The study demonstrates that this
   recovery method can be useful for harmonized data generation and routine
   viral analyses of shellfish. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: An influenza pandemic occurred in 2009 and myocarditis
   associated with the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic was reported among
   hospitalized patients from August 2009.
   Methods and Results: The Japanese Circulation Society organized the
   Clinical Research Committee on Myocarditis Associated with Influenza
   Pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 and called for a case report on myocarditis for a
   national survey. The diagnosis of myocarditis was performed using the
   Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Myocarditis (JCS 2009).
   Fifteen patients were reported to the committee. Fulminant myocarditis
   developed in 10 patients. Mechanical circulatory support (intra-aortic
   balloon pumping (IABP) and/or percutaneous cardiopulmonary support
   (PCPS)) was used on all 10 patients, 8 of whom were rescued.
   Abnormalities on echocardiography and elevated cardiac enzymes were seen
   in most of the patients. Myocarditis was found by endomyocardial biopsy
   in 6 patients. Three patients had complications with pneumonia.
   Conclusions: In reality, myocarditis associated with pandemic influenza
   A (H1N1) seemed to be more common in hospitalized patients, compared
   with previous seasonal influenza virus outbreaks. To avoid misdiagnosis
   of acute myocarditis associated with influenza pandemic A (H1N1) 2009,
   it is essential to determine the characteristic symptoms, signs, and
   laboratory findings of acute myocarditis during influenza pandemics.
   Mechanical circulatory support (IABP and/or PCPS) was required to rescue
   patients with fulminant myocarditis. (Circ J 2010; 74: 2193-2199)}},

Abstract = {{The apparent molar volume of quinic acid and its sodium salt were
   determined from the density data of aqueous solutions up to molality of
   0.4 mol kg(-1) and in the temperature range from 293.15 to 328.15 K. The
   apparent molar volume of sodium quinate comprises the ionic and the
   associated ion-pair contributions. From the apparent molar volumes of
   quinic acid and the quinate ion, the molecular contributions to that of
   quinic acid are derived. At 298.15 K, the limiting apparent molar volume
   of quinic acid is 119.8 +/- 0.5 cm(3) mol(-1), and that of the quinic
   ion is 111.6 +/- 0.3 cm(3) mol(-1). Similarly, at 298.15 K, the limiting
   apparent molar expansibility of sodium quinate is 0.198 +/- 0.003 cm(3)
   mol(-1) K(-1), and that of quinic acid is 0.142 +/- 0.003 cm(3) mol(-1)
   K(-1). From these limiting ionic and molecular apparent molar volumes,
   the limiting volume change caused by ionization of quinic acid was
   calculated as -8.2 cm(3) mol(-1) at 298.15 K. The coefficients of
   thermal expansion of these solutions were calculated from the density
   data, and from these the apparent molar expansibilities of quinic acid
   and its sodium salt were derived.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this article are (i) to utilize computer methods in
   detection of stent struts imaged in vivo by optical coherence tomography
   (OCT) during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI); (ii) to provide
   measurements for the assessment and monitoring of in-stent restenosis by
   OCT post PCI. Thirty-nine OCT cross-sections from seven pullbacks from
   seven patients presenting varying degrees of neointimal hyperplasia
   (NIH) are selected, and stent struts are detected. Stent and lumen
   boundaries are reconstructed and one experienced observer analyzed the
   strut detection, the lumen and stent area measurements, as well as the
   NIH thickness in comparison to manual tracing using the reviewing
   software provided by the OCT manufacturer (LightLab Imaging, MA, USA).
   Very good agreements were found between the computer methods and the
   expert evaluations for lumen cross-section area (mean difference = 0.11
   +/- 0.70 mm(2); r(2) = 0.98, P < 0.0001) and the stent cross-section
   area (mean difference = 0.10 +/- 1.28 mm(2); r(2) = 0.85, P value <
   0.0001). The average number of detected struts was 10.4 +/- 2.9 per
   cross-section when the expert identified 10.5 +/- 2.8 (r(2) = 0.78, P
   value < 0.0001). For the given patient dataset: lumen cross-sectional
   area was on the average (6.05 +/- 1.87 mm(2)), stent cross-sectional
   area was (6.26 +/- 1.63 mm(2)), maximum angle between struts was on the
   average (85.96 +/- 54.23 degrees), maximum, average, and minimum
   distance between the stent and the lumen were (0.18 +/- 0.13 mm), (0.08
   +/- 0.06 mm), and (0.01 +/- 0.02 mm), respectively, and stent
   eccentricity was (0.80 +/- 0.08). Low variability between the expert and
   automatic method was observed in the computations of the most important
   parameters assessing the degree of neointimal tissue growth in stents
   imaged by OCT pullbacks. After further extensive validation, the
   presented methods might offer a robust automated tool that will improve
   the evaluation and follow-up monitoring of in-stent restenosis in
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to develop a new - and easy to use - method for
   early night-time near-surface air temperature pattern estimation based
   on surface temperature data in urban areas. The surface temperature data
   have been collected by an airborne thermal infrared sensor at an
   altitude of 2000 m above ground level. The study area was covered by
   hundreds of images with a spatial resolution of about 2 m. The measured
   values were calibrated with data of in situ surface measurements of
   different land use types. Simultaneous air temperature measurements were
   carried out using a carbased temperature sensor along an almost 12 km
   long N-S urban transect. The measured points were located using a GPS
   device. Data were processed with GIS methods, including newly developed
   algorithms. In order to find the relationship between air and surface
   temperatures a wider environment, the source area which determines the
   air temperature at a given point and time was taken into account. Using
   a source area with a radius of 500 m, a strong relationship was detected
   between the two parameters. Namely, the temperatures of the surfaces
   found in the surroundings (weighted by the distance) determine the
   temperature of the air parcel located at a given point. The obtained
   regression equation was applied to extend our results in order to model
   the air temperature field in a larger urban area.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Identification of biomarkers for the natural history of
   abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) holds the key to non-surgical
   intervention and improved selection for AAA repair. We aimed to
   associate the basic proteomic composition of AAA wall tissue with the
   expansion rate and size in patients with AAA. Methods: A proteomic
   approach was used, consisting of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (MS) to identify
   differentially expressed proteins in AAA tissue. Relevant protein spots
   were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS/MS). Results: Spearman's correlation analysis revealed 16 protein
   spots were strongly correlated with AAA expansion rate (rho> +/- 0.75).
   Nine protein spots were identified. Six protein spots showed correlation
   with AAA size (rho> +/- 0.5). Three protein spots were identified:
   vitronectin with traces of calreticulin, albumin and a spot containing
   two proteins: collagen alpha-3(VI) chain and vitamin D binding protein.
   Interestingly, in our previous study vitronectin was shown to be
   down-regulated in a ruptured AAA group compared with non-ruptured AAA.
   Western blot analysis in the present study confirmed a correlation of
   vitronectin bands with AAA size in aortic aneurysm tissue. Conclusion: A
   proteomic approach seems valuable, and identified several candidates not
   previously associated with AAA. Larger studies are required to confirm
   the potential and clinical role of the identified proteins. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{It has been well documented that the 15- to 35-Hz oscillatory activity
   of the sensorimotor cortex shows coherence with the muscle activity
   during weak to moderate steady contraction. To investigate the muscle
   dependency of the corticomuscular coherence and its training-related
   alterations, we quantified the coherence between electroencephalogram
   (EEG) from the sensorimotor cortex and rectified electromyogram (EMG)
   from five upper limb (first dorsal interosseous, flexor carpi radialis,
   extensor carpi radialis, biceps brachii, triceps brachii) and four lower
   limb muscles (soleus, tibialis anterior, biceps femoris, rectus
   femoris), while maintaining a constant force level at 30\% of maximal
   voluntary contraction of each muscle, in 24 untrained, 12 skill-trained
   (ballet dancers), and 10 strength-trained (weightlifters) individuals.
   Data from untrained subjects demonstrated the muscle dependency of
   corticomuscular coherence. The magnitude of the EEG-EMG coherence was
   significantly greater in the distally located lower limb muscles, such
   as the soleus and tibialis anterior, than in the upper or other lower
   limb muscles in untrained subjects (P < 0.05). These results imply that
   oscillatory coupling between the sensorimotor cortex and spinal
   motoneurons during steady contraction differs among muscles, according
   to the functional role of each muscle. In addition, the ballet dancers
   and weightlifters showed smaller EEG-EMG coherences than the untrained
   subjects, especially in the lower limb muscles ( P < 0.05). These
   results indicate that oscillatory interaction between the sensorimotor
   cortex and spinal motoneurons can be changed by long-term specialized
   use of the muscles and that this neural adaptation may lead to finer
   control of muscle force during steady contraction.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed account of the experimental methodology of surface pump-probe
   femtosecond-laser mass spectrometry is presented. This recently

   reaction via multiphoton ionization. As a model system, the
   photodissociation dynamics of methyl iodide adsorbed at submonolayer

   surface preparation and characterization as well as the pulsed
   deposition of methyl iodide are described. The femtosecond-laser
   excitation (pump) and, in particular, the resonant multiphoton
   ionization surface detection (probe) schemas are discussed in detail.
   Results of pump-probe time-resolved methyl and iodine atom detection
   experiments are presented and the potential of this method for

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was the assessment of volatile organic
   compounds produced by Sporidiobolus salmonicolor (CBS 2636) using methyl
   and ethyl ricinoleate, ricinoleic acid and castor oil as precursors. The
   analysis of the volatile organic compounds was carried out using Head
   Space Solid Phase Micro-Extraction (HS - SPME). Factorial experimental
   design was used for investigating extraction conditions, verifying
   stirring rate (0-400 rpm), temperature (25-60 degrees C), extraction
   time (10-30 minutes), and sample volume (2-3 mL). The identification of
   volatile organic compounds was carried out by Gas Chromatography with
   Mass Spectrum Detector (GC/MSD). The conditions that resulted in maximum
   extraction were: 60 degrees C, 10 minutes extraction, no stirring,
   sample volume of 2.0 mL, and addition of saturated KCl (1: 10 v/v). In
   the bio-production of volatile organic compounds the effect of stirring
   rate (120-200 rpm), temperature (23-33 degrees C), pH (4.0-8.0),
   precursor concentration (0.02-0.1\%), mannitol (0-6\%), and asparagine
   concentration (0-0.2\%) was investigated. The bio-production at 28
   degrees C, 160 rpm, pH 6,0 and with the addition of 0.02\% ricinoleic
   acid to the medium yielded the highest production of VOCs, identified as
   1,4-butanediol, 1,2,2-trimethylciclopropilamine, beta-ionone;

Abstract = {{Little information is available regarding the auditory function in Pompe
   patients. Hearing loss has been reported in classic infantile patients,
   but it is still unknown whether central nervous system involvement
   interferes with auditory function and whether enzyme replacement therapy
   can improve hearing. Auditory function has not been studied in children
   with milder forms of the disease. We analyzed repetitive auditory
   brainstem response measurements and pure tone audiometry in 24 children
   with Pompe disease. Only 1 of 13 patients with milder phenotypes showed
   recurrent conductive hearing loss, while 10 out of 11 classic infantile
   patients had sensorineural hearing defects. These patients also had a
   high prevalence of conductive hearing loss. Five patients showed
   evidence of mild retrocochlear pathology, suggestive of glycogen
   accumulation in the central nervous system. Hearing loss persisted
   during therapy in all patients. The results emphasize the need for
   careful monitoring of auditory function in classic infantile Pompe
   patients, and for early implementation of hearing aids to protect speech

Abstract = {{Objective Transcranial sonography (TCS) shows characteristic
   hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra (SN) in patients with
   Parkinson's disease (PD). Although this feature is well established,
   sufficient observer reliability and diagnostic accuracy are
   prerequisites for advancements of this method.
   Methods The authors investigated both aspects in a cross-sectional study
   with four blinded TCS raters in 22 PD patients and 10 healthy controls.
   Results As expected, the authors found significant bilateral SN
   hyperechogenicity in PD patients. Quantitative computerised SN
   planimetry had a substantial intra- (intraclass correlation coefficient
   (ICC) 0.97 and 0.93 respectively for both hemispheres) and inter-rater
   reliability (ICC 0.84 and 0.89), while visual semiquantitative
   echogenicity grading of the SN revealed a moderate intrarater (weighted
   kappa 0.80 ipsilateral and 0.74 contralateral) and slight (0.33) to fair
   (0.51) inter-rater reliability only. Diagnostic accuracy measured as the
   area under the curve of receiver-operating characteristics plots was
   highest in TCS of the SN opposite the clinically most affected body side
   (planimetry 0.821, echogenicity grading 0.792) with a hyperechogenic
   area of 0.24 cm(2) as the optimum cut-off value for the differentiation
   between PD and controls (sensitivity 79\%, specificity 81\%).
   Conclusions The data demonstrate that the observer variability of SN
   planimetry is low in the hands of experienced investigators. This
   approach also offers adequate diagnostic accuracy. The authors conclude
   that reliable SN TCS data on PD can be achieved in clinical routine and
   multicentre trials when standardised analysis protocols and certain
   quality criteria of brain parenchyma sonography are met.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 180 pigs was slaughtered in the same slaughterhouse, but
   divided in six different trials distributed over Winter (December-March)
   and Summer (April-September). Meat quality measurements (pH, electrical
   conductivity, color and/or water-holding capacity) were carried out 30
   min, 24 and/or 35 h after slaughter in three different muscles: M.
   gracilis, M. semimembranosus and M. longissimus dorsi. A tendency
   towards a higher proportion of PSE meat during Summer was found in the
   examined muscles. Moreover a higher protein, higher dry matter content,
   a lower water/protein ratio and a lower slicing yield were found for the
   cooked hams suggesting a higher PSE prevalence in the Summer. A lairage
   time between 2 and 4 h during Summer and less than 2 h during Winter was
   related to a lower proportion of PSE meat. The correlation coefficients
   between the individual meat quality variables were moderate, but showed
   the predictive power of the pH measured 24 h post-mortem in the M.
   gracilis for meat quality. (C) 2010 The American Meat Science

Abstract = {{Objective. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is important in the innate
   immune response. MBL2 gene polymorphisms affect MBL expression, and
   genotypes yielding low MBL levels have been associated with an elevated
   risk for infections in hematological cancer patients undergoing
   chemotherapy. However, these reported associations are inconsistent, and
   data on patients with solid tumors are lacking. Here, we investigated
   the effects of MBL2 genotypes on irinotecan-induced febrile neutropenia
   in patients with solid tumors.
   Patients and Methods. Irinotecan-treated patients were genotyped for the
   MBL2 gene. Two promoter (-550 H/L and -221 X/Y) and three exon
   polymorphisms (52 A/D, 54 AIR, and 57 A/C) were determined, together
   with known risk factors for irinotecan-induced toxicity. Neutropenia and
   febrile neutropenia were recorded during the first course.
   Results. Of the 133 patients, 28\% experienced severe neutropenia and
   10\% experienced febrile neutropenia. No associations were found between
   exon polymorphisms and febrile neutropenia. However, patients with the
   H/H promoter genotype, associated with high MBL levels, experienced
   significantly more febrile neutropenia than patients with the H/L and
   L/L genotypes (20\% versus 13\% versus 5\%). Moreover, patients with the
   HYA haplotype encountered significantly more febrile neutropenia than
   patients without this high MBL-producing haplotype (16\% versus 4\%). In
   the subgroup with wild-type exon polymorphisms (A/A), patients with the
   high MBL promoter phenotype had the highest incidence of febrile
   neutropenia, regardless of known risk factors.
   Conclusion. Patients with high MBL2 promoter genotypes and haplotypes
   seem more at risk for developing febrile neutropenia. If confirmed,
   these preliminary findings may contribute to more individualized
   approaches of irinotecan treatment. The Oncologist 2010; 15:1063-1072}},

Abstract = {{Methods. The study population is a sample of the general population of
   Groningen, the Netherlands (n = 3398). UAC was measured (nephelometry)
   in a first morning void urine sample collected at home and sent to a
   laboratory by post. Information on demographics and the presence of CV
   risk factors was obtained by a questionnaire. The presence of CKD was
   determined during examination at an outpatient clinic.
   Results. At baseline, 12\% of the subjects met the criteria of Approach
   1, 33\% of Approach 2, 8\% of Approach 3 and 25\% of Approach 4. CKD was
   diagnosed in 370 subjects (11\%). Approach 2 detected the most CKD
   patients (sensitivity 65\%), while Approach 3 resulted in the lowest
   number needed to screen (1.9). During a follow-up of 7 years, only the
   UAC pre-screening approaches detected CKD patients who had both
   significantly accelerated renal function loss and increased CV risk
   compared to subjects without CKD. Only 28\% of CKD patients detected by
   the UAC approaches used antihypertensive/angiotensin-converting enzyme
   inhibitor treatment prior to screening.
   Conclusions. This study suggests that pre-screening based on UAC should
   be favoured in comparison to screening based on CKD risk factors to
   detect CKD patients at high renal and CV risk.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Short-term follow-up studies show good results in foot
   function, after surgical treatment of idiopathic clubfeet. Long-term
   follow-up studies are rare and probably represent a mixture of
   experience of different treating orthopedic surgeons. The purpose of
   this study is to present the long-term results of the posteromedial
   release (PMR) in congenital clubfoot treatment of 1 treating surgeon.
   Materials and Methods: Thirty-eight patients with 58 clubfeet had an a
   la carte PMRe, performed by 1 experienced pediatric orthopedic surgeon
   before the age of 2 years. This group had a mean follow-up of 16 years
   (range 13 to 24 years). All patients were interviewed and examined.
   Thereafter, the standing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the
   feet were taken. The results of the treatment were graded according to
   the system of Laaveg and Ponseti, and with the radiographs the grade of
   osteoarthritis was determined. The results were compared with the
   controlateral normal feet.
   Results: In 53 feet, the mean rating was 80.6 points (range 43 to 97),
   according to the system of Laaveg and Ponseti. There were 15 excellent,
   17 good, 13 fair, and 8 poor results. The majority of patients had the
   limitation of foot function with a significant decrease in dorsiflexion
   of 31\% and a significant decrease of pronation-suppination of 24\%. The
   grade of osteoarthritis was consistently higher in the clubfeet than in
   the controlateral normal feet. Five feet (9\%) needed an additional bony
   procedure because of pain and overcorrection of the clubfeet. This was
   considered to be a failure of the surgical treatment.
   Conclusion: In our study population, PMR will lead to stiff, and
   therefore to clinical not fully functional, feet after a follow-up of 16
   years.
   Level of Evidence: Therapeutic level III.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Transthoracic contrast echocardiography (TTCE) can detect
   pulmonary right-to-left shunting (RLS) and is used to screen for
   pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) in patients with
   hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). We studied the prevalence
   and size of pulmonary RLS in HHT type 1, HHT type 2, and HHT-negative
   controls, and its positive predictive value (PPV) and negative
   predictive value (NPV) for PAVMs that can be treated by embolotherapy.
   Methods: In 343 consecutive persons referred for possible HHT as
   first-degree family members of index patients a TTCE and chest CT scan
   were performed. All persons were offered genetic analysis.
   Results: An HHT-causing mutation was confirmed in 92 (mean age 41 +/- 15
   y; 59\% female) HHT1 relatives and in 97 (mean age 47 +/- 14 y; 52\%
   female) HHT2 relatives. TTCE showed a pulmonary RLS in 78 (85\%) HHT1-
   and 34 (35\%) HHT2-related mutation carriers, respectively (P<.0001). In
   HHT1 relatives, 29 of 53 (55\%) PAVMs and in HHT2 relatives three of 17
   (18\%) PAVMS were treated, resulting in a PPV of TTCE for treatable
   PAVMs of 36.3\% and 8.3\%, respectively. The accompanying NPV was 100\%.
   A minimal, moderate, or large shunt was present in 12 (13\%), 24 (26\%),
   and 42 (46\%) HHT1-related, and in 20 (21\%), 6 (6\%), and 8 (8\%)
   HHT2-related mutation carriers, respectively (P for trend <.0001). A
   large shunt predicted treatable PAVMs in 55.8\% of HHT1 relatives and
   37.5\% of HHT2 relatives. TTCE was positive in four (6\%) of 63 persons
   without HHT.
   Conclusions: A pulmonary shunt on TTCE is more prevalent and larger in
   HHT1- compared with HHT2-related mutation carriers. Shunt grading is
   helpful to predict treatable PAVMs, particularly in the HHT2 group. TTCE
   is also positive in a small fraction of persons without HHT. CHEST 2010;

Abstract = {{Objective. The treatment of patients with fibromyalgia (FM), a
   high-prevalence chronic pain condition with a high impact on both
   patients and society, poses a great challenge to clinicians due to a
   lack of effective treatments. In view of the large individual
   variability in outcome, selecting patients at risk of long-term
   dysfunction and offering tailored treatment may be promising for
   beneficial treatment effects.
   Methods. High-risk patients were selected and classified into 2 groups
   (pain-persistence and pain-avoidance groups) and subsequently randomized
   in groups to either a treatment condition (TC) or a waiting list control
   condition (WLC). Treatment consisted of 16 sessions of
   cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and exercise training in groups,
   tailored to the patient's specific cognitive-behavioral pattern,
   delivered within 10 weeks. Physical and psychological functioning and
   impact of FM were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month
   followup. Treatment effects were evaluated using a linear mixed model.
   Results. The treatment effects were significant for all primary
   outcomes, showing significant differences in physical (pain, fatigue,
   and functional disability) and psychological (negative mood and anxiety)
   functioning, and impact of FM for the TC in comparison with the WLC.
   Effect sizes in the TC were overall large, and reliable change indices
   indicated a clinically relevant improvement among the TC.
   Conclusion. The presented results demonstrate for the first time that
   tailored CBT and exercise training for high-risk patients with FM is
   effective in improving short-and long-term physical and psychological
   functioning, indicating that tailoring treatment is likely to promote
   beneficial outcomes in FM and reduce the burden for patients and
   society.}},

Abstract = {{Sepsis and septic shock are frequently encountered in the intensive care
   unit. Despite the evolution of intensive care medicine during the last
   decades, septic shock is still associated with high mortality and
   complications of sepsis such as cholestasis, liver dysfunction, and
   massive intravascular volume deficit. Little is known about the whole
   pattern of changes at the transcriptional level during the development
   of acute sepsis. Here we present a detailed molecular biological
   analysis of the events in the liver during the first day of acute
   bacterial infection in a clinically relevant model of porcine peritoneal
   sepsis. Before and 21 h after induction of sepsis by autologous fecal
   inoculum, liver samples were taken for microarray analysis. There were
   two groups of animals (7 control and 8 sepsis), two of each group where
   used in microarray, the remaining were used for confirmation of selected
   genes by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Pathway analysis revealed
   that in acute sepsis, gene expression was significantly changed in
   processes related to apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidant/redox balance.
   Although after 21 h these animals are expected to die within the next 3
   to 4 h from massive complications, functional induction of apoptosis
   could not be confirmed. Computer analysis identified three key regulator
   genes (IL8, CCL2, and CXCL2) among the first genes to be upregulated
   specifically in the sepsis group, and these can directly or indirectly
   control the bulk of the sepsis response. Induction of inflammatory
   mediators by sepsis was supported by the detection of corresponding
   cytokines (interleukin 6 and interleukin 8) in the blood.}},

Abstract = {{In independent studies delirium was associated with higher levels of
   cortisol, interleukin(IL)s, and S100B. The aim of this study was to
   simultaneously compare cortisol, IL-6, IL-8, and S100B levels in
   patients aged 65 years and older admitted for hip fracture surgery with
   and without delirium. Cortisol, IL-6, IL-8, and S100B were assayed in
   repeated blood samples. 120 patients (mean age 84 years, 62 patients
   with delirium) were included. Highest levels of IL-8 (27.1, 95\%
   Confidence Interval (CI): 13.6-53.1 pg/ml) and cortisol (666, 95\% CI:
   475-859 nmol/L) were before delirium, but of IL-6 (84.3, 95\% CI:
   46.5-151.4 pg/ml) and S100B (0.18, 95\% CI: 0.12-0.24 mu g/L) during
   delirium. In multivariable analysis cortisol, LogIL-6, and LogS100B were
   significantly associated with delirium, but adjusted for pre-existing
   cognitive impairment, only LogS100B remained significantly associated.
   Cortisol, IL-6 and S100B may have a role in the pathogenesis of
   delirium, but S100B is the strongest independent marker. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The pharmacological properties of essential oils have been widely
   studied However the interaction and contribution of the individual
   constituents assayed singularly and in combination remains relatively
   unexplored To investigate these possible interactions, various essential
   oil constituents (EOC's) were combined and the interactions on their
   antimalarial and toxicity properties determined using the tritiated
   hypoxanthine incorporation and the tetrazolium-based cellular viability
   assays, respectively In combination, two inactive EOC's (IC50 values
   greater than 1 mM), rho-cymene and carvacrol interacted in a synergistic
   manner (Sigma FIC= 0 02) against a chloroquine-resistant strain of
   Plasmodium falciparum This interaction was comparable to that between
   the potent E- and Z-(+/-)-nerolidol (IC50 value 0 9 +/- 0 3 mu M) and
   the standard antimalarial, quinine (IC50 value 0 13 +/- 0 04 mu M)
   (Sigma FIC=0 01) However, this latter combination also potentiated the
   toxicity (Sigma FIC=0 001) of each molecule A similar increase in
   toxicity was noted between p-cymene and gamma-terpinene, as well as E-
   and Z-()-nerolidol and (-)-pulegone These results show that the
   pharmacological activities of individual EOC's can vary greatly when

Abstract = {{The development of antagonists to the alpha 4 integrin family of cell
   adhesion molecules has been an active area of pharmaceutical research to
   treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Presently being tested in
   human clinical trials are compounds selective for alpha 4 beta 1 (VLA-4)
   as well as several dual antagonists that inhibit both alpha 4 beta 1 and
   alpha 4 beta 7. The value of a dual versus a selective small molecule
   antagonist as well as the consequences of inhibiting different affinity
   states of the alpha 4 integrins have been debated in the literature.
   Here, we characterize TBC3486, a N,N-disubstituted amide, which
   represents a unique structural class of non-peptidic, small molecule
   VLA-4 antagonists. Using a variety of adhesion assay formats as well as
   flow cytometry experiments using mAbs specific for certain
   activation-dependent integrin epitopes we demonstrate that TBC3486
   preferentially targets the high affinity conformation of alpha 4 beta 1
   and behaves as a ligand mimetic. The antagonist is capable of blocking
   integrin-dependent T-cell co-activation in vitro as well as proves to be
   efficacious in vivo at low doses in two animal models of allergic
   inflammation. These data suggest that a small molecule alpha 4 integrin
   antagonist selective for alpha 4 beta 1 over alpha 4 beta 7 and,
   specifically, selective for the high affinity conformation of alpha 4
   beta 1 may prove to be an effective therapy for multiple inflammatory
   diseases in humans. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach is suggested for determining the kinetic parameters and
   rate constants of the elementary steps of reversible chain reactions
   having self-acceleration periods due to the long time required for the
   concentrations of the chain-carrier radicals to reach their steady-state
   values. This approach is illustrated by the example of the reversible
   chain reaction between N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-benzoquinonediimine and
   2,5-dichlorohydroquinone in chlorobenzene. The disappearance rate of one
   of the initial reactants, N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-benzoquinonediimine, at the
   inflection point of its disappearance curve, is considered as the basic
   kinetic characteristic of the reaction. The empirical function y =
   aexp(bt (c) ) + d, where a, b, c, and d are the fitted parameters (b <
   0, c > 1), is suggested for approximating the S-shaped kinetic curves
   and for calculating the reaction rate. The rate constants of the
   elementary steps are preferably derived from experimental data obtained
   at equal concentrations of the initial reactants, and also product
   additions when their effect on the reaction rate is studied. The
   effective rate constant of chain termination is derived from the time to
   reach the steady state. The results obtained in this way are compared
   with earlier data obtained using the ``initial{''} reaction rates
   calculated by means of exponential approximation of portions of
   N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-benzoquinonediimine disappearance curves after the
   inflection point.}},

Title = {{Pigeonpea genomics initiative (PGI): an international effort to improve
   crop productivity of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.)}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR BREEDING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{393-408}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), an important food legume crop in the
   semi-arid regions of the world and the second most important pulse crop
   in India, has an average crop productivity of 780 kg/ha. The relatively
   low crop yields may be attributed to non-availability of improved
   cultivars, poor crop husbandry and exposure to a number of biotic and
   abiotic stresses in pigeonpea growing regions. Narrow genetic diversity
   in cultivated germplasm has further hampered the effective utilization
   of conventional breeding as well as development and utilization of
   genomic tools, resulting in pigeonpea being often referred to as an
   `orphan crop legume'. To enable genomics-assisted breeding in this crop,
   the pigeonpea genomics initiative (PGI) was initiated in late 2006 with
   funding from Indian Council of Agricultural Research under the umbrella
   of Indo-US agricultural knowledge initiative, which was further expanded
   with financial support from the US National Science Foundation's Plant
   Genome Research Program and the Generation Challenge Program. As a
   result of the PGI, the last 3 years have witnessed significant progress
   in development of both genetic as well as genomic resources in this crop
   through effective collaborations and coordination of genomics activities
   across several institutes and countries. For instance, 25 mapping
   populations segregating for a number of biotic and abiotic stresses have
   been developed or are under development. An 11X-genome coverage
   bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library comprising of 69,120
   clones have been developed of which 50,000 clones were end sequenced to
   generate 87,590 BAC-end sequences (BESs). About 10,000 expressed
   sequence tags (ESTs) from Sanger sequencing and ca. 2 million short ESTs
   by 454/FLX sequencing have been generated. A variety of molecular
   markers have been developed from BESs, microsatellite or simple sequence
   repeat (SSR)-enriched libraries and mining of ESTs and genomic amplicon
   sequencing. Of about 21,000 SSRs identified, 6,698 SSRs are under
   analysis along with 670 orthologous genes using a GoldenGate SNP (single
   nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping platform, with large scale SNP
   discovery using Solexa, a next generation sequencing technology, is in
   progress. Similarly a diversity array technology array comprising of ca.
   15,000 features has been developed. In addition, > 600 unique nucleotide
   binding site (NBS) domain containing members of the NBS-leucine rich
   repeat disease resistance homologs were cloned in pigeonpea; 960 BACs
   containing these sequences were identified by filter hybridization, BES
   physical maps developed using high information content fingerprinting.
   To enrich the genomic resources further, sequenced soybean genome is
   being analyzed to establish the anchor points between pigeonpea and
   soybean genomes. In addition, Solexa sequencing is being used to explore
   the feasibility of generating whole genome sequence. In summary, the
   collaborative efforts of several research groups under the umbrella of
   PGI are making significant progress in improving molecular tools in
   pigeonpea and should significantly benefit pigeonpea genetics and
   breeding. As these efforts come to fruition, and expanded (depending on
   funding), pigeonpea would move from an `orphan legume crop' to one where
   genomics-assisted breeding approaches for a sustainable crop improvement
   are routine.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, dynamic ageing characteristics associated with the
   application of equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) to Al6061 alloy at
   elevated temperatures was investigated. Followed by ECAP, Vickers
   microhardness measurement on the cross-sectional planes and
   microstructural observations were undertaken using transmission electron
   microscopy. The combination of the ECAP process with dynamic ageing at
   both 100 degrees C and 150 degrees C resulted in a significant increase
   in hardness. The grain size was measured as similar to 160 nm after four
   passes. A comparison with the published data on the same alloy processed
   by ECAP at room temperature and statically aged, suggests several
   advantages in incorporating dynamic ageing with ECAP. These advantages
   consist of the ability to attain better grain refinement, increased
   hardness and the potential for saving time and energy. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Recent research has indicated that individuals with social
   interaction anxiety make biased interpretations of positive social
   interactions, with greater general apprehension in response to such
   events and more negative predictions about the future. There has also
   been some preliminary evidence for a second facet of interpretation
   bias, namely a failure to accept others' positive reactions at face
   value, but this has so far not been adequately studied. Method: The
   present study developed a new measure of this ``discounting{''}
   dimension and utilized a nonclinical sample of undergraduate students to
   provide an initial analysis of the scale. Results: Results provide early
   support for the psychometric properties of our scale, and indicate that
   discounting mediates the relationship between social interaction anxiety
   and low positive affect, over and above the previously studied aspect of
   positive event interpretation bias. Conclusions: The implications for
   treatment interventions and further research are discussed.}},

   Design: Historical cohort study.
   Setting: Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia,

   Patients: Adult patients undergoing elective surgery at a tertiary care
   center who were administered the STOP-BANG questionnaire for 3
   consecutive days in May 2008.
   Main Outcome Measures: Number and types of complications.
   Results: A total of 135 patients were included in the study, of whom 56
   (41.5\%) had high risk scores for OSAS. The mean (SD) age of patients
   was 57.9 (14.4) years; 60 (44.4\%) were men. Patients at high risk of
   OSAS had a higher rate of postoperative complications compared with
   patients at low risk (19.6\% vs 1.3\%; P<.001). Age, American Society of
   Anesthesiologists class of 3 or higher, and obesity were associated with
   an increased risk of postoperative complications. On multivariate
   analysis, high risk of OSAS and American Society of Anesthesiologists
   class 3 or higher were associated with higher odds of complications.
   Conclusion: The STOP-BANG questionnaire is useful for preoperative
   identification of patients at higher than normal risk for surgical
   complications, probably because it identifies patients with occult OSAS.}},

   breviflorus (Amaryllidaceae): implications for seed production}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{106}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Animal pollination is typically an uncertain process that interacts with
   self-incompatibility status to determine reproductive success. Seed set
   is often pollen-limited, but species with late-acting
   self-incompatibility (SI) may be particularly vulnerable, if self-pollen
   deposition results in ovule discounting. Pollination is examined and the
   occurrence of late-acting SI and ovule discounting assessed in
   Cyrtanthus breviflorus.
   The pollination system was characterized by observing floral visitors
   and assessing nectar production and spectral reflectance of flowers. To
   assess late-acting SI and ovule discounting, growth of self- and
   cross-pollen tubes, and seed set following open pollination or hand
   pollination with varying proportions of self- and cross-pollen, were
   examined.
   Native honeybees Apis mellifera scutellata pollinated flowers as they
   actively collected pollen. Most flowers (>= 70 \%) did not contain
   nectar, while the rest produced minute volumes of dilute nectar. The
   flowers which are yellow to humans are visually conspicuous to bees with
   a strong contrast between UV-reflecting tepals and UV-absorbing anthers
   and pollen. Plants were self-incompatible, but self-rejection was
   late-acting and both self- and cross-pollen tubes penetrated ovules.
   Seed set of open-pollinated flowers was pollen-limited, despite pollen
   deposition exceeding ovule number by 6-fold. Open-pollinated seed set
   was similar to that of the cross + self-pollen treatment, but was less
   than that of the cross-pollen-only treatment.
   Flowers of C. breviflorus are pollinated primarily by pollen-collecting

   clade of the Amaryllidaceae. Pollinators of C. breviflorus deposit
   mixtures of cross- and self-pollen and, because SI is late-acting,
   self-pollen disables ovules, reducing female fertility. This study thus
   contributes to growing evidence that seed production in plants with

Title = {{The Risk of West Nile Virus Infection Is Associated with Combined Sewer
   Overflow Streams in Urban Atlanta, Georgia, USA}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: At present, the factors favoring transmission and
   amplification of West Nile Virus (WNV) within urban environments are
   poorly understood. In urban Atlanta, Georgia, the highly polluted waters
   of streams affected by combined sewer overflow (CSO) represent
   significant habitats for the WNV mosquito vector Culex quinquefasciatus.
   However, their contribution to the risk of WNV infection in humans and
   birds remains unclear.
   OBJECTIVES: Our goals were to describe and quantify the spatial
   distribution of WNV infection in mosquitoes, humans, and corvids, such
   as blue jays and American crows that are particularly susceptible to WNV
   infection, and to assess the relationship between WNV infection and
   proximity to CSO-affected streams in the city of Atlanta, Georgia.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied spatial statistics to human, corvid,
   and mosquito WNV surveillance data from 2001 through 2007. Multimodel
   analysis was used to estimate associations of WNV infection in Cx.
   quinquefasciatus, humans, and dead corvids with selected risk factors
   including distance to CSO streams and catch basins, land cover, median
   household income, and housing characteristics.
   RESULTS: We found that WNV infection in mosquitoes, corvids, and humans
   was spatially clustered and statistically associated with CSO-affected
   streams. WNV infection in Cx. quinquefasciatus was significantly higher
   in CSO compared with non-CSO streams, and WNV infection rates among
   humans and corvids were significantly associated with proximity to
   CSO-affected streams, the extent of tree cover, and median household
   income.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study strongly suggests that CSO-affected streams are
   significant sources of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes that may
   facilitate WNV transmission to humans within urban environments. Our
   findings may have direct implications for the surveillance and control
   of WNV in other urban centers that continue to use CSO systems as a
   waste management practice.}},

Abstract = {{P>Effect of heat treatment involved in domestic cooking on the
   bioaccessibility of beta-carotene from yellow-orange as well as green
   leafy vegetables was evaluated. Heat treatment of these vegetables by
   pressure-cooking, stir-frying and open-pan boiling had a beneficial
   influence on the bioaccessibility of beta-carotene. The extent of
   increase in the per cent bioaccessibility of beta-carotene as a result
   of pressure-cooking was 21-84\%. Stir-frying in presence of a small
   quantity of oil brought about an enormous increase in the
   bioaccessibility of beta-carotene from these vegetables, the extent of
   increase being 67-191\%. Open-pan boiling of vegetables increased the
   bioaccessibility of beta-carotene in the range 23-36\%. Thus, among the
   three domestic heat processing methods, stir-frying results in maximum
   bioaccessibility of this provitamin. The use of suitably heat-processed
   vegetable sources of beta-carotene could form a dietary strategy to
   derive this micronutrient maximally by the population dependent on plant
   foods.}},

Abstract = {{Hundreds of genomes have been successfully sequenced to date, and the
   data are publicly available. At the same time, the advances in
   large-scale expression and purification of recombinant proteins have
   paved the way for structural genomics efforts. Frequently, however,
   little is known about newly expressed proteins calling for large-scale
   protein characterization to better understand their biochemical roles
   and to enable structure function relationship studies. In the Structural
   Genomics Consortium (SGC), we have established a platform to
   characterize large numbers of purified proteins. This includes screening
   for ligands, enzyme assays, peptide arrays and peptide displacement in a
   384-well format. In this review, we describe this platform in more
   detail and report on how our approach significantly increases the
   success rate for structure determination. Coupled with high-resolution
   X-ray crystallography and structure-guided methods, this platform can
   also be used toward the development of chemical probes through screening
   families of proteins against a variety of chemical series and focused
   chemical libraries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   femoral gland structure, as these are shifted towards the distal part of
   the thigh, close to the knee joint. The new species are apparently
   microendemic to a small stretch of Madagascar's east coast and have so
   far not been found at higher elevations. Since both new species are
   tolerant of habitat disturbance and occur in anthropogenically altered
   habitats, such as plantations and villages, we propose an IUCN threat

Abstract = {{Chronic inflammation has been implicated in the pathology of
   hypertension; however, the role for specific cytokines remains unclear.
   We tested whether tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockade with etanercept
   (Etan) reduces mean arterial pressure in a female mouse model of
   systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic inflammatory
   disorder with prevalent hypertension. Thirty-week-old SLE (NZBWF1) and
   control mice (NZW/LacJ) received Etan (0.8 mg/kg SC weekly) for 4 weeks
   or vehicle. Mean arterial pressure (in millimeters of mercury) was
   increased in SLE mice (150 +/- 5 versus 113 +/- 5 in controls; P < 0.05)
   and was lower in Etan-treated SLE mice (132 +/- 3) but not controls (117
   +/- 5). Albuminuria (in micrograms per milligram of creatinine) was
   elevated in SLE mice (28 742 +/- 9032 versus 1075 +/- 883; P < 0.05) and
   was lower in Etan-treated SLE mice (8154 +/- 3899) but not control
   animals (783 +/- 226). Glomerulosclerosis (in percentage of glomeruli)
   was evident in SLE mice (2.5 +/- 1.6 versus 0.0 +/- 0.0 in controls; P <
   0.05) and was ameliorated in Etan-treated SLE mice (0.1 +/- 0.1). Renal
   cortex CD68(+) cell staining (in percentage of area) was elevated in SLE
   mice (4.75 +/- 0.80 versus 0.79 +/- 0.12 in controls; P < 0.05) and was
   lower in Etan-treated SLE mice (2.28 +/- 0.32) but not controls (1.43
   +/- 0.25). Renal cortex NADPH oxidase activity (relative light units per
   milligram of protein) was higher in SLE mice compared with controls (10
   718 +/- 1276 versus 7584 +/- 229; P +/- 0.05) and lowered in
   Etan-treated SLE mice (6645 +/- 490). Renal cortex nuclear factor kappa
   B (phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated) was increased in SLE mice
   compared with controls and lower in Etan-treated SLE mice. These data
   suggest that TNF-alpha mechanistically contributes to the development of
   hypertension in a chronic inflammatory disease through increased renal
   nuclear factor kappa B, oxidative stress, and inflammation.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Olive oil mill wastewaters (OMW) from a three-phase system
   were treated in a laboratory-scale continuous stirred tank reactor
   (CSTR) for hydrogen production. Microbiological and physicochemical
   characterizations of raw and anaerobically treated olive oil mill
   effluents were performed. Toxicity assessment was also conducted in
   order to determine the impact of residual waters on the aquatic
   environment.
   RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa that has the ability to utilize phenolic
   compounds was isolated in raw OMW, along with several gram-negative
   bacteria (Serratia odorifera, Enterobacter cloacae and Aeromonas
   hydrophila). The dominant species in the untreated effluent appears to
   be Enterobacter cloacae, whereas in the treated effluent it is
   Citrobacter braakii. Phenols, pH, NO(2)(-), total dissolved solids (TDS)
   and conductivity were the main parameters related to the observed
   toxicity.
   CONCLUSION: A significant differentiation in the microbiological flora
   was detected between treated and untreated effluents whereas the
   microbial communities were correlated to the toxicity test results,
   pointing to the need for further research regarding identification of
   the microbial flora. This can improve the treatment processes to
   optimize management of OMW for environmentally safe discharge. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In South Africa, relatively small, but healthy populations of Opsaridium
   peringueyi remain in the middle reaches of the Luvuvhu, Blyde, Sabie and
   Pongolo Rivers. The species may be extinct in some rivers like the
   Shingwedzi and lower-Olifants and its status is uncertain in the
   Crocodile and lower Komati/Mlumati Rivers. In many cases the rivers are
   transformed by the combined impact of alien species, dams and weirs,
   water abstraction, water regulation, pollution from industrial,
   agricultural, mining, forestry and urban areas as well as by
   sedimentation. These factors have caused the species distribution to
   become fragmented and have made it vulnerable to possible extinction.
   Because of the transformed nature of river systems in South Africa, the
   use of older historical data for biodiversity planning and conservation
   assessments might increase the risk of underrating conservation status
   and risks.}},

Abstract = {{West Nile virus (WNV) is widely distributed in South Africa, but since a
   few cases of neurological disease have been reported from this region,
   endemic lineage 2 strains were postulated to be of low virulence.
   Several cases of nonfatal encephalitis in humans as well as fatal cases
   in a foal, dog, and ostrich chicks have, however, been associated with
   lineage 2 WNV in South Africa. The pathogenesis of lineage 2 WNV strains
   was investigated using mouse neuroinvasive experiments, gene expression
   experiments, and genome sequence comparisons which indicated that
   lineage 2 strains that are highly pathogenic exist. To determine whether
   cases of WNV were being missed in South Africa, horses with fever and
   neurological disease were investigated. Several cases of WNV were
   identified, all associated with severe neurological disease, 85\% of
   which had to be euthanized or died. All cases positive by RT-PCR were
   shown to belong to lineage 2 WNV by DNA sequencing and phylogenetic
   analysis. Two cases of occupational infection were investigated,
   including a case of zoonotic transmission to a veterinarian who
   performed an autopsy on one of the horses as well as a laboratory
   infection after a needle stick injury with a neuroinvasive lineage 2
   strain. Both resulted in neurological disease. Cytokine expression was
   investigated in the second case to assess the immunopathogenesis of WNV.
   Collectively, these studies suggest that lineage 2 WNV may be
   significantly under estimated as a cause of neurological disease in
   South Africa.}},

Journal = {{ORAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{686-695}},

Abstract = {{Objective:
   This study was designed to test the hypothesis that periodontal
   pathogens Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis are
   synergistic in terms of virulence potential using a model of
   mixed-microbial infection in rats.
   Materials and methods:
   Three groups of rats were infected orally with either T. forsythia or P.
   gingivalis in mono-bacterial infections or as mixed-microbial infections
   for 12 weeks and a sham-infected group were used as a control. This
   study examined bacterial infection, inflammation, immunity, and alveolar
   bone loss changes with disease progression.
   Results:
   Tannerella forsythia and P. gingivalis genomic DNA was detected in
   microbial samples from infected rats by PCR indicating their
   colonization in the rat oral cavity. Primary infection induced
   significantly high IgG, IgG2b, IgG1, and IgG2a antibody levels
   indicating activation of mixed Th1 and Th2 immune responses. Rats
   infected with the mixed-microbial consortium exhibited significantly
   increased palatal horizontal and interproximal alveolar bone loss.
   Histological examinations indicated significant hyperplasia of the
   gingival epithelium with moderate inflammatory infiltration and apical
   migration of junctional epithelium. The results observed differ compared
   to uninfected controls.
   Conclusion:
   Our results indicated that T. forsythia and P. gingivalis exhibit
   virulence, but not virulence synergy, resulting in the
   immuno-inflammatory responses and lack of humoral immune protection
   during periodontitis in rats.}},

Abstract = {{Alexithymia is a multifaceted personality construct which encompasses
   difficulties in identifying and expressing feelings along with an
   externally oriented cognitive style. We investigated whether congruent
   vs. incongruent emotional musical priming (happy and angry music) during
   encoding would moderate the effects of alexithymia on recognition rates.
   We found that high alexithymia scorers recognized fewer joy and anger
   words than low scorers. Angry music decreased recognition rates in high
   alexithymia scorers compared to low alexithymia scorers. The congruency
   and incongruency effects between music and words depended on alexithymia
   level. The anger deficit in high alexithymia scorers and the possible
   support provided by happiness cues are discussed. Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Variation in personality traits is 30-60\% attributed to genetic
   influences. Attempts to unravel these genetic influences at the
   molecular level have, so far, been inconclusive. We performed the first
   genome-wide association study of Cloninger's temperament scales in a
   sample of 5117 individuals, in order to identify common genetic variants
   underlying variation in personality. Participants' scores on Harm
   Avoidance, Novelty Seeking, Reward Dependence, and Persistence were
   tested for association with 1,252,387 genetic markers. We also performed
   gene-based association tests and biological pathway analyses. No genetic
   variants that significantly contribute to personality variation were
   identified, while our sample provides over 90\% power to detect variants
   that explain only 1\% of the trait variance. This indicates that
   individual common genetic variants of this size or greater do not
   contribute to personality trait variation, which has important
   implications regarding the genetic architecture of personality and the
   evolutionary mechanisms by which heritable variation is maintained. (c)

Abstract = {{Efficient and high-gain aperture coupled patch antenna arrays with
   superstrate at 60 GHz are studied and presented. It is noted that adding
   a superstrate with a specific size will induce a significant effect on
   antenna gain and radiation patterns. This capability is applied on the
   design of 2 x 2 and 4 x 4 arrays for high-gain application. The maximum
   measured gain of a 2 x 2 superstrate antenna array is 16 dBi with an
   efficiency of 63\%, which is 4 dB higher than that of a classical 2 x 2
   array at 60 GHz. The 2:1 measured voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR)
   bandwidth is 6.8\%. Also the maximum gain measured for a 4 x 4
   superstrate antenna array is found to be 19.7 dBi with an estimated
   efficiency of 51\%. The radiation patterns are found to be broadside all
   over the frequency band with very low back radiation. Hence aperture
   coupled superstrate antenna array is a good candidate for high-efficient
   high-gain application at 60 GHz. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {{Cow raw milk from dairy cooperatives was examined for its microbial
   composition. Among the isolates identified, 17.6\% were yeasts. The most
   frequent genus was Candida, although members belonging to the genera
   Brettanomyces, Dekkera, and Geotricum were also identified. Although
   qualitative and quantitative tests for extracellular proteolytic
   activity were positive for all the species isolated, Candida buinensis
   showed the highest response (23.5 U/mg); therefore, it was selected for
   subsequent investigation. The results of fermentations carried out at
   variable temperature, pH, and soybean flour concentration, according to
   a 2(3) full factorial design, demonstrated that this yeast ensured the
   highest production of extracellular proteases (573 U/mL) when cultivated
   at 35 A degrees C, pH 6.5, and using soybean flour concentrations in the
   range 0.1-0.5\% (w/v). The cell-free supernatants showed the highest
   activity at 25 A degrees C and pH 7.0, and satisfactory stability in the
   ranges 25-30 A degrees C and pH 7-9. The first-order rate constants of
   protease inactivation in the cell-free supernatants were calculated at
   different temperatures from semi-log plots of the residual activity
   versus time and then used in Arrhenius and Eyring plots to estimate the
   main thermodynamic parameters of thermoinactivation (E{*} = 40.0 kJ/mol;
   Delta H{*} = 37.3 kJ/mol; Delta S{*} = -197.5 J/mol K; Delta G{*} = 101

Abstract = {{In the internal French Alps, subalpine grasslands become dominated by
   the tussock grass, Festuca paniculata, when mowing ceases. Does litter
   or living plants affect seedling recruitment in these subalpine
   communities, and does this vary between mown and unmown grasslands? Can
   the vegetation patterns observed in the field be related to the effects
   of F. paniculata ? These hypotheses were tested using both a field and
   pot experiment. Seedlings of Bromus erectus, a subordinate species in
   these grasslands, were used as phytometers in both experiments. At both
   mown and unmown subalpine grassland sites in the French Alps, a removal
   experiment was established. This field experiment included removal of
   litter and living vegetation in order to differentiate their respective
   effect on seedling establishment. Vegetation and litter had contrasting
   effects. Vegetation affected the recruitment success of B. erectus by
   limiting seedling growth at the mown site and survival at the unmown
   site. Litter modified recruitment only at the unmown site, where it
   increased survival but limited growth. Survival and growth of seedlings
   responded to different environmental factors. Survival was determined
   more by soil moisture, while growth probably depended more on light
   availability. Where there is a thick litter layer, as is the case in
   unmown subalpine grasslands, the competitive effect of vegetation can be
   counterbalanced by an increase in soil moisture due to the litter
   reducing rate of evaporation of water. The effect on seedlings of the
   presence of Festuca paniculata, the dominant species at these sites, was
   also quantified using a pot experiment, including a cutting treatment.
   This experiment showed that the competitive effect of the vegetation
   could be largely explained by the inhibitory effect on growth of the
   dominant species, F. paniculata. This study provides a better
   understanding of the processes that result in conservative plants, such
   as E paniculata, becoming dominant in these subalpine environments upon
   cessation of traditional management practices.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the influence of quenching/tempering
   temperatures on the fracture toughness and fatigue life of SAE 5160
   steel, considering different phosphorus contents. Quenching and
   tempering treatments were applied to samples removed from different bars
   of commercial SAE 5160 steel with different P content. Three different
   austenitizing temperatures for quenching: 850, 900 and 1000 degrees C
   and a constant holding time of 15 minutes were used. The oil temperature
   for quenching was kept at 66 degrees C and the tempering conditions were
   470, 500 and 530 degrees C with the necessary time for a final hardness
   of 45 +/- 3 HRC. Therefore, the heat treatments cycles were applied to
   specimens containing low (0.012 wt. (\%)), medium (0.017 wt. (\%)) and
   high (above 0.025 wt. (\%)) phosphorus contents, in order to observe the
   effects of this element on the susceptibility of these steels to enhance
   quench and tempering embrittlements. The Charpy tests results showed
   that the phosphorus content analyzed in this work has caused
   embrittlement, even in the bars with the lowest P content, leading to
   intergranular fracture. However, if the nucleation life is taken into
   consideration, this embrittlement has no effect on the nucleation
   fatigue life of the component.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of soils and other geologic media is a complex
   three-dimensional object. Most of the physical material properties
   including mechanical and hydraulic characteristics are immediately
   linked to the structure given by the pore space and its spatial
   distribution. It is an old dream and still a formidable challenge to
   relate structural features of porous media to their functional
   properties. Using tomographic techniques, soil structure can be directly
   observed at a range of spatial scales. In this paper we present a
   scale-invariant concept to quantify complex structures based on a
   limited set of meaningful morphological functions. They are based on d+1
   Minkowski functionals as defined for d-dimensional bodies. These basic
   quantities are determined as a function of pore size or aggregate size
   obtained by filter procedures using mathematical morphology. The
   resulting Minkowski functions provide valuable information on the size
   of pores and aggregates, the pore surface area and the pore topology
   having the potential to be linked to physical properties. The
   theoretical background and the related algorithms are presented and the
   approach is demonstrated for the pore structure of an arable soil and
   the pore structure of a sand both obtained by X-ray micro-tomography. We
   also analyze the fundamental problem of limited resolution which is
   critical for any attempt to quantify structural features at any scale
   using samples of different size recorded at different resolutions. The
   results demonstrate that objects smaller than 5 voxels are critical for
   quantitative analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aims:
   Investigating the effect of perturbations, with relatively low Cu
   concentrations, on yeast community composition in low-nutrient virgin
   soil.
   Methods and Results:
   Culturable soil yeast populations were monitored at an experimental site
   treated with the fungicide copper oxychloride (10 mg Cu per kg soil).
   Yeast numbers were unaffected by additional Cu; however, a shift in
   yeast community composition from Hymenomycetes to Urediniomycetes
   species occurred. Subsequent growth experiments conducted with a
   synthetic liquid medium revealed that hymenomycetous and
   urediniomycetous yeasts were affected differently by 1 and 10 mg l-1 Cu.
   Soil microcosm experiments then indicated that additional 10 mg kg-1 Cu
   may improve the competitive ability of urediniomycetous yeasts in the
   presence of hymenomycetous yeasts.
   Conclusions:
   The shift from hymenomycetous to urediniomycetous yeasts, as a result of
   slightly increased soil Cu levels, may be because of hymenomycetous
   yeasts being more sensitive to elevated Cu levels and urediniomycetous
   yeasts having an improved competitive ability in the presence of
   elevated Cu levels.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   Yeast community composition of pristine low-nutrient soils may change as
   a result of perturbations with relatively low concentrations of Cu.
   Urediniomycetous yeasts should be studied as potential bio-indicators of
   Cu perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper highlights an innovative application of inorganic-binding
   peptides as quality control tools for detecting defects on inorganic

   chemical composition defects of mu m size and crystallographic state
   defects. Proof of concept was demonstrated by monitoring binding of a
   previously isolated ZnO-binding peptide to galvanized steel substrates.
   The approach was further validated for TiO2 coatings and stainless
   steel, with two new, specific inorganic-binding peptides isolated by
   phage display. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive, cancer
   susceptibility disorder characterized by diverse clinical features, such
   as short stature, skeletal or skin abnormalities, progressive bone
   marrow (BM) failure, and increased risk of malignancies. Clonal
   chromosomal abnormalities are frequently reported in FA patients
   transformed to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia
   (AML). AIM: To study the incidence of malignancy and clonal chromosomal
   abnormalities in FA patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight
   clinically diagnosed FA patients were studied at the time of diagnosis
   and the patients were followed-up for a maximum of 28 months at 3-month
   intervals. The median duration of follow-up of these patients was 19.8
   months. Chromosomal breakage investigation using mitomycin C (MMC)and
   diepoxybutane (DEB)-induced peripheral blood cultures were stimulated
   with phytohemagglutinin. Cytogenetic study was done on the BM cells to
   detect clonal chromosomal aberrations. RESULTS: Eleven (28.95\%) out of
   38 patients developed malignancies, including 6 (54.54\%) MDS, 4
   (36.36\%) AML, and 1 (2.63\%) squamous cell carcinoma. The clonal
   chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 5 (45.45\%) FA patients who
   developed malignancies and the type of chromosomal abnormality detected
   were monosomies 5, 7, trisomy 10, dup(1)(q12-q24), and inv(7)(p11pter).
   CONCLUSION: The FA patients have a high risk of developing malignancies,
   and clonal chromosomal abnormalities play an important role in the
   prognosis of the disease. Therefore, FA patients need to be followed-up
   at regular intervals for early diagnosis and optimal management of the
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Bandstructure engineering has enabled a broad array of semiconductor

   impossible to design structures that isolate a specific physical
   property that directly correlates with experimental results. To overcome
   this problem, we developed a new methodology, inverse quantum
   engineering (IQE), which employs an evolutionary algorithm to design
   families of structures with everything identical except for a specific
   physical property of our choosing. We show that IQE allows creation of
   model families of designs that isolate targeted experimental effects,
   thus allowing direct investigation of specific physical mechanisms and

Abstract = {{The general phylogeographical paradigm for eastern North America (ENA)
   is that many plant and animal species retreated into southern refugia
   during the last glacial period, then expanded northward after the last
   glacial maximum (LGM). However, some taxa of the Gulf and Atlantic
   Coastal Plain (GACP) demonstrate complex yet recurrent distributional
   patterns that cannot be explained by this model. For example, eight
   co-occurring endemic plant taxa with ranges from New York to South
   Carolina exhibit a large disjunction separating northern and southern
   populations by > 300 km. Pyxidanthera (Diapensiaceae), a plant genus
   that exhibits this pattern, consists of two taxa recognized as either
   species or varieties. We investigated the taxonomy and phylogeography of
   Pyxidanthera using morphological data, cpDNA sequences, and amplified
   fragment length polymorphism markers. Morphological characters thought
   to be important in distinguishing Pyxidanthera barbulata and P.
   brevifolia demonstrate substantial overlap with no clear
   discontinuities. Genetic differentiation is minimal and diversity
   estimates for northern and southern populations of Pxyidanthera are
   similar, with no decrease in rare alleles in northern populations. In
   addition, the northern populations harbour several unique cpDNA
   haplotypes. Pyxidanthera appears to consist of one morphologically
   variable species that persisted in or near its present range at least
   through the latter Pleistocene, while the vicariance of the northern and
   southern populations may be comparatively recent. This work demonstrates
   that the refugial paradigm is not always appropriate and GACP endemic
   plants, in particular, may exhibit phylogeographical patterns
   qualitatively different from those of other ENA plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To determine if chronic lead exposure is associated with
   non-verbal memory performance and if this association is affected by
   organisation strategies, a component of executive functions.
   Methods We administered the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test,
   both copy (ROCF-C) and 30-min delayed recall (ROCF-DR), to 358 current
   lead smelter workers with a mean (SD) age of 41 (9.1) years, education
   of 11 (2.7) years, and working lifetime-weighted average blood lead
   (TWA) of 39 (12.0) mu g/dl. Copy and delay organisation scores,
   surrogates for executive functions, were developed for ROCF-C and
   ROCF-DR. We used multiple regression analyses to examine the
   relationship between TWA and ROCF performance, organisational scores,
   and the interaction of organisational scores and TWA after adjusting for
   relevant covariates.
   Results Organisational scores, while not associated with years of
   education, were significantly correlated with ROCF-C and ROCF-DR
   performance. We found a significant relationship between TWA and ROCF-DR
   but not with ROCF-C performance. The interactions of TWA by copy
   organisation and TWA by delay organisation were significant for ROCF-DR
   with a significant dose-effect relationship only in participants with
   lower organisational scores.
   Conclusions Chronic lead exposure was significantly associated with
   complex figure test delayed recall but not copy performance.

Abstract = {{This article empirically investigates the role of organizational
   structure in the transformational leadership (TFL) process. We examine
   organizational centralization, formalization, and size as antecedents of
   an organization's TFL climate, and as moderators of the relationship
   between TFL climate and productive organizational energy (POE).
   Hypotheses are tested using a sample of 125 organizations. Results show
   that both the centralization and size of an organization are negatively
   related to its TFL climate, whereas formalization has a positive
   association. Further, while there is a positive linkage between TFL
   climate and POE, both centralization and formalization moderate this
   relationship. The TFL climate-POE linkage is diminished under conditions
   of high centralization, and it is enhanced under conditions of high
   formalization. These findings point to the role of organizational
   structure as a boundary condition for both the occurrence and the
   effectiveness of TFL in organizations. The paper concludes by
   acknowledging its limitations and discussing its implications for
   practice and research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A complex signalling network governs the response of Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae to an array of environmental stimuli and stresses In the
   present article, we provide an overview of the main signalling system
   and discuss the mechanisms by which yeast integrates and separates
   signals from these sources. We apply our classification scheme to a
   simple semi-quantitative model of the HOG (high-osmolarity glycerol)/FG
   (filamentous growth)/PH (pheromone) MAPK (mitogen-activated protein
   kinase) signalling network by perturbing its signal integration
   mechanisms under combinatorial stimuli of osmotic stress, starvation and
   pheromone exposure in silica Our findings include that the Hog1 MAPK
   might act as a timer for filamentous differentiation, not allowing
   morphological differentiation before osmo-adaptation is sufficiently
   completed. we also see that a mutually exclusive decision-making between
   pheromone and osmo-response might not be taken on the MAPK level and
   transcriptional regulation of MAPK targets. We conclude that signal
   integration mechanisms in a wider network including the cell cycle have
   to be taken into account for which our framework might provide focal
   points of study.}},

Abstract = {{As a means to investigate the applicability of the direct tensile
   strength (DT) test as a surrogate fatigue crack test, the ductility and
   fatigue crack resistance potential of various asphalt (HMA) mixes were
   evaluated in the laboratory using the DT test, at ambient temperature
   (20 degrees C) and a displacement loading rate of 1,27 mm/min. Various
   HMA mixes were included in the DT test program and the results were
   compared with those of the Overlay Tester, also conducted at ambient
   temperature. Up to 23 commonly used Texas HMA mixes with different mix
   design characteristics were evaluated and are discussed in this paper.
   The results indicated that the mix design volumetrics, such as the
   asphalt binder content and aggregate gradation, play a significant role
   in the ductility and fatigue crack resistance potential of HMA mixes.
   The dense-to fine-graded HMA mixes with high asphalt binder content
   exhibited better ductility potential and laboratory fatigue crack
   resistance than the coarse- and open-graded mixes. Overall, the DT test
   was found to be a promising surrogate fatigue crack test for mix design
   and HMA mix screening for fatigue crack resistance in the laboratory.
   Recommendations to improve the test protocol are included in the paper.
   However, sample fabrication and test set-up were the two critical issues
   found to be associated with the DT test.}},

Title = {{Mobile Filter: Exploring Filter Migration for Error-Bounded Continuous

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{4093-4104}},

Abstract = {{In wireless sensor networks, filters that suppress data update reports
   within predefined error bounds effectively reduce the traffic volume for
   continuous data collection. All prior filter designs, however, are
   stationary in the sense that each filter is attached to a specific
   sensor node and remains stationary over its lifetime. In this paper, we
   propose a mobile filter, i.e., a novel design that explores the
   migration of filters to maximize overall traffic reduction. A mobile
   filter moves upstream along the data-collection path, with its residual
   size being updated according to the collected data. Intuitively, this
   migration extracts and relays unused filters, leading to more proactive
   suppression of update reports. While extra communications are needed to
   move filters, we show through probabilistic analysis that the overhead
   is outrun by the gain from suppressing more data updates. We present an
   optimal filter-migration algorithm for a chain topology. The algorithm
   is then extended to general multichain and tree topologies. Extensive
   simulations demonstrate that, for both synthetic and real data traces,
   the mobile filtering scheme significantly reduces data traffic and
   extends network lifetime against a state-of-the-art stationary filtering
   scheme. Such results are also observed from experiments over a Mica-2
   sensor network testbed.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles are regarded as promising transfection reagents for
   effective and safe delivery of nucleic acids into a specific type of
   cells or tissues providing an alternative manipulation/therapy strategy
   to viral gene delivery. However, the current process of searching novel
   delivery materials is limited due to conventional low-throughput and
   time-consuming multistep synthetic approaches. Additionally,
   conventional approaches are frequently accompanied with unpredictability
   and continual optimization refinements, impeding flexible generation of
   material diversity creating a major obstacle to achieving high
   transfection performance. Here we have demonstrated a rapid
   developmental pathway toward highly efficient gene delivery systems by
   leveraging the powers of a supramolecular synthetic approach and a
   custom-designed digital microreactor. Using the digital microreactor,
   broad structural/functional diversity can be programmed into a library
   of DNA-encapsulated supramolecular nanoparticles (DNA subset of SNPs) by
   systematically altering the mixing ratios of molecular building blocks
   and a DNA plasmid. In vitro transfection studies with DNA subset of SNPs
   library identified the DNA subset of SNPs with the highest gene
   transfection efficiency, which can be attributed to cooperative effects
   of structures and surface chemistry of DNA subset of SNPs. We envision
   such a rapid developmental pathway can be adopted for generating
   nanoparticle-based vectors for delivery of a variety of loads.}},

Abstract = {{ACo(2)O(4) (A=Mg, Ni, Zn) and ACo(2)O(4)/HZSM-5 (A=Mg, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn,
   Zr, La) catalysts were synthesized by the citric acid-ligated combustion
   method and by low-temperature complex impregnation, respectively. The
   catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), ammonia
   temperature. programmed desorption (NH3-PD), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDS). The
   performance of the catalysts was evaluated with micro fixed bed reactor.
   The results showed that the catalytic activity was affected by the
   A-site ion, and when the A. site ion was Ni, Fe, Zr, or La, the
   catalysts had better catalytic activity and the temperature of N2O
   decomposition was lower. Compared with ACo(2)O(4), the ACo(2)O(4)/HZSM-5
   catalyst had better catalytic activity. ACo(2)O(4) was present as
   ultrafine particles on the HZSM-5 zeolite and the ACo(2)O(4)/HZSM-5
   catalyst had good acidity. All these factors are useful in improving the
   performance of these catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{The Chinese tussah silkworm, Antheraea pernyi (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae)
   produces a rare dienoic sex pheromone composed of
   (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienal, (EZ)-6,11-hexadecadienyl acetate and
   (E,Z)-4,9-tetradecadienyl acetate, and for which the biosynthetic routes
   are yet unresolved. By means of gland composition analyses and in vivo
   labeling we evidenced that pheromone biosynthesis towards the immediate
   dienoic gland precursor, the (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienoic acid, involves
   desaturation steps with Delta(6) and An regioselectivity. cDNA cloning
   of pheromone gland desaturases and heterologous expression in yeast
   demonstrated that the 6,11-dienoic pheromone is generated from two
   biosynthetic routes implicating a Delta(6) and Delta(11) desaturase duo
   albeit with an inverted reaction order. The two desaturases first
   catalyze the formation of the (E)-6-hexadecenoic acid or
   (Z)-11-hexadecenoic acid, key mono-unsaturated biosynthetic
   intermediates. Subsequently, each enzyme is able to produce the
   (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienoic acid by accommodating its non-respective
   mono-unsaturated product. Besides elucidating an unusually flexible
   pheromone biosynthetic pathway, our data provide the first
   identification of a biosynthetic Delta(6) desaturase involved in insect
   mate communication. The occurrence of this novel e desaturase function
   is consistent with an evolutionary scenario involving
   neo-functionalization of an ancestral desaturase belonging to a gene
   lineage different from the Delta(11) desaturases commonly involved in
   moth pheromone biosynthesis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aimed at the problem of determining the protectionscope of steep

   method of three- dimensional fast Lagrange method, the dynamic
   development process of stress distribution and deformation of protected
   coal seam with exploitation of steeply inclined protective seam of
   pitching oblique mining are simulated. Besides, the law of the stress
   and normal deformation are analyzed with the advance of upper protective
   layer coalface; according to the protection criterion of stress relief
   criterion and normal deformation criterion of protected seam, the
   protection angle on the dip and strike are ascertained. The result shows
   that the protection angles on the upper and bottom dip direction are
   81.5 degrees and 74 degrees, respectively; while the protection angle on
   strike direction are variational, ranging from 30 degrees to 52
   degrees(;) the most largest protection angle is in the middle pitching
   oblique coalface. By comparison with the field investigation, the result
   of the numerical simulation is consistent with the field investigation.

   Model-receiver function analysis using BATS data}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{183}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{P>By analysing teleseismic waveform data, we propose a large-scale
   Taiwan Reference Moho Discontinuity Model (TRMDM) through coherent
   stacking and H-kappa analysis of receiver functions (RFs). Tectonic
   structural features are determined from accurate crustal thickness (H)
   and reliable Vp/Vs ratio (kappa) (consequently Poisson's ratio, Sigma)
   estimations for Taiwan. The best estimated regional average Moho depth
   is 33.5 +/- 2.9 km. Noted is a westward crustal thinning from 39 +/- 3.0
   km in eastern Taiwan to 30 +/- 1.5 km in southeastern China. The
   averaged Moho depth is 23.0 +/- 2.5 km in northern Taiwan and increases
   to 33.5 +/- 2.0 km in the south. The markedly thin crust and high Vp/Vs
   ratio in northern Taiwan are mainly associated with backarc opening and
   magmatic activities. Based on H-kappa estimations and associated
   seismicity patterns beneath Suang-Long (SSLB) and adjacent four
   stations, we propose two Moho reference models that exhibit distinctive
   crustal thickening in central Taiwan. The spatial variations of crustal
   thickness models show strong lateral change in the Moho topography. The
   thick crust in the south, thin crust in the north and transition in
   central Taiwan mark the different tectonic units between the subduction
   wedge and the collision prism onshore.
   In view of the following list of constraints: thicker crust in the south
   than in the north; eastward crust thickening; significant Moho depth
   changes; clear 9-11 s subcrustal boundaries from five stations; the
   compelling thickening of crust and upper mantle beneath the central
   mountain belt; seismicity patterns with the absence of mantle earthquake
   in the Wadati-Benioff zone; regional geological features; the occurrence
   of the inland Chi-Chi earthquake; the compelling low kappa at YULB (1.58
   +/- 0.13) that may extend to central Taiwan at SSLB (1.59 +/- 0.23);
   relatively thick crust at YULB (39.5 +/- 1.6 km) and SSLB (40.5 +/- 1.3
   km or 52.5 +/- 1.5 km), and finally, the apparent horizontal offset
   between highest Yu Shan Mountain and the deepest Moho at SSLB, we are
   able to suggest that the initial subduction of the Eurasian Plate
   occurred in southern Taiwan and most likely extended to the transition
   zone in central Taiwan. Although the current RF study is limited by
   large interstation distance, our analysis provides more notable
   constraints than previous studies to explicitly determine the
   characteristic features of Moho discontinuity. This detailed approach
   means that rather than treating the tectonic framework as a whole
   heterogeneous lithospheric feature, clear Moho boundary geometry
   variations indicate that active orogenic processes and differential
   tectonic stress loading create separate and complex crustal and
   subcrustal-to-upper-mantle structural features caused by the
   arc-continent collision.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of Y-doping on the magnetic, dielectric and ferroelectric
   properties of EuMnO3 were carefully investigated through a series of
   polycrystalline Eu1-xYxMnO3 (x = 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.3 and 0.5) samples
   prepared by solid state reaction. The Y-doping reduces the A-site ionic
   size and then the Mn-O-Mn bond angle. It is postulated that upon the
   doping, the magnetic ground state firstly changes to a conical spin
   order at x = 0.15 and then a spiral spin order for higher doping. The
   ferroelectric transitions appear at the conical and spiral spin order
   transition points similar to 25 K, and a polarization similar to 90 mu
   C/m(2) is achieved in sample with x = 0.25. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Lead acetate (300 mg/L) and/or cadmium chloride (50 mg/L) were
   administered as drinking water to Sprague-Dawley rats for 8 weeks to
   investigate the possible combined effects of these metals on the damage
   in renal cortex mitochondria. Increased malonaldehyde levels due to
   exposure to these metals were detected by colorimetric method, which
   demonstrated the lipid peroxidation in the renal cortex. Ultrastructural
   observations and real-time quantitative PCR analyses were performed on
   kidney cortex pieces to identify the mitochondrial damage and quantify
   the relative expression levels of cytochrome oxidase subunits
   (COX-I/II/III), respectively. The most striking ultrastructural
   modifications involved distortion of mitochondrial cristae and an
   unusual arrangement, which were more evident when the mixture was
   ingested. There were significant differences in the expression levels of
   COX-I, II, and III between the control group and the exposed groups,
   whereas those in the (lead+cadmium) group were all significantly lower
   than that in the lead or cadmium group. In conclusion, there was an
   obvious synergistic oxidative damage effect of lead combined with
   cadmium on rat kidney cortex mitochondria, which increased defects in
   mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.}},

Title = {{The influence of baroreflex sensitivity on ambulatory arterial stiffness
   index in individuals with cardiovascular risk}},
Journal = {{BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{262-267}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives Although the predictor role of ambulatory arterial stiffness
   index (AASI) for cardiovascular risk has been shown, the question of
   whether AASI is a measure of arterial stiffness or, in fact, reflects
   influence of other origins on the arterial tree remains to be
   determined. We sought to elucidate whether AASI is associated with
   baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) or blood pressure (BP) reactivity to stress
   in individuals with cardiovascular risk.
   Methods A total of 120 participants were included in this study.
   Ambulatory BP measurements were performed over a 24-h period. AASI was
   calculated as 1 minus the regression slope of diastolic on systolic BP
   obtained from 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring data. BRS was estimated from
   the spontaneous changes in systolic BP and corresponding interbeat heart
   rate intervals. BP reactivity was induced by three stressors including
   the Stroop Color and Word Test, anger recall interview, and handgrip
   exercise. Arterial stiffness was determined by the pulse wave velocity.
   Results AASI significantly and inversely correlated to resting BRS (r =
   -0.24, P = 0.01) and BRS under stress (r = -0.33, P = 0.02) but not with
   systolic blood pressure reactivity (P = 0.92) or pulse wave velocity (P
   = 0.53). Adjusting for possible confounders, BRS independently predicted
   AASI (P = 0.01).
   Conclusion Increased AASI is associated with reduced BRS. Decreased BRS
   may at least in part explain the prognostic role of AASI in predicting
   cardiovascular risk. Our findings add support to the clinical
   significance of AASI. In particular, AASI may aid in the detection of
   cardiovascular risk. Blood Press Monit 15:262-267 (C) 2010 Wolters

Abstract = {{CXCR4 and its ligand, SDF-1 alpha, play an important role in the
   targeted metastasis of colon cancer. In this study, we analyzed an
   expression of CXCR4 in clinical samples and showed that SDF-1 alpha
   affected the expression of CXCR4 in colon cancer cells.
   A total of 388 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) who underwent
   surgery in Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 2000 to 2004 were
   included. The expression of CXCR4 in CRC was visualized by
   immunohistochemistry (anti-CXCR4 mAb, R\&D 12G5). HCT116, SW480, and
   SW620 cells were treated with SDF-1 alpha in vitro and the CXCR4
   proteins located in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments were
   separated and analyzed with western blotting.
   The frequency of cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of CXCR4 in
   colorectal cancers was 35.6\% and 36.9\%, respectively. Nuclear but not
   cytoplasmic expression of CXCR4 was associated with advanced CRC (p <
   0.001) and lymphovascular invasion. However, in multivariate analysis,
   nuclear expression of CXCR4 did not correlate with patients' outcome. In
   the in vitro study, SDF-1 alpha, stimulation of three colorectal
   carcinoma lines enhanced the CXCR4 nuclear expression.
   Expression of the CXCR4 plays a role in CRC progression and may be
   associated with SDF-1 alpha stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{P>The brain steady state level of beta-amyloid (A beta) is determined by
   the balance between its production and removal, the latter through
   egress across blood and CSF barriers as well as A beta degradation. The
   major A beta-degrading enzymes are neprilysin (NEP), insulin-degrading
   enzyme (IDE), and endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE-1). Although
   evidence suggests that NEP is down-regulated in Alzheimer's disease
   (AD), the role of IDE and ECE in the A beta accumulation in aging and
   dementia remains less certain. In this study, we examined mRNA and
   protein expression, as well as biological activity of NEP, IDE, and
   ECE-1 in human frontal cortex by real-time RT-PCR for mRNA,
   immunoblotting for protein, and highly sensitive and specific
   fluorescence assays for activity. The relationships between A
   beta-degrading enzymes and pathologic measures and clinical features
   were also assessed. The results showed that NEP mRNA, protein level, and
   activity were decreased in AD compared with normal controls with no
   cognitive impairment (NCI). In contrast, IDE activity was unchanged, but
   there was higher expression of IDE mRNA, indicating a possible
   compensatory reaction because of deficits in activity. ECE-1 expression
   in AD brain showed no significant difference compared with age-matched
   controls. Correlation analyses suggested that NEP expression was
   correlated with A beta accumulation and clinical diagnosis, being lower
   in AD than in no cognitive impairment. In contrast, neither IDE nor
   ECE-1 correlated with A beta or clinical diagnosis. These findings
   provide additional support for NEP as the major protease involved in A
   beta degradation and suggest its possible therapeutic targeting in AD.}},

   that the proposed ANN model is forced to follow the given reaction
   mechanisms. Both advantages of self-learning ability of ANN and the
   existing knowledge of HDS were taken into account. Lengthy training
   process is minimised. Effects of operating temperature, pressure, and
   LHSV on the sulfur removal rate are studied. The inhibition of nitrogen

   measurements, the intra-tidal variations of sediment transport in the
   highly turbid river mouth was observed and the tidal straining effect
   occurred. Our study showed that tidal straining of longitudinal sediment
   concentration gradients can contribute to intra-tidal variability in
   sediment stratification and to asymmetries in sediment distribution
   within a tidal cycle. In particular, the tidal straining effect in the
   Huanghe River estuary strengthened the sediment-induced stratification
   at the flood tide, thus producing a higher bottom sediment concentration
   than that during the ebb. A sediment transport model that is capable of
   simulating sediment-induced stratification effect on the hydrodynamics
   in the bottom boundary layers and associated density currents was
   applied to an idealized estuary to demonstrate the processes and to
   discuss the mechanism. The model-predicted sediment processes resembled
   the observed characteristics in the Huanghe River estuary. We concluded
   that tidal straining effect is an important but poorly understood
   mechanism in the transport dynamics of cohesive sediments in turbid
   estuaries and coastal seas.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of spin-state phase transition is investigated with
   {[}Fe(C4H4N2)\{Pt(CN)(4)\}] that is a novel 3D Hofmann-like compound.
   The bistability of this system is obtained by the first-principles
   calculation. It is demonstrated that thermal expansion is the intrinsic
   force involved in spin-state transition. Based on these results, we
   suggest a thermal exciting bistable model of spin-state transition with
   a temperature dependent crystal-field splitting (CFS). Experimental
   evidence of spin-state phase transition coincides with our theoretical
   model. This model approaches something fundamental in the mechanism
   leading to the transition, and it is important in developing new and

Abstract = {{Polar molecule dominated electrorheological (ER) fluid is a new type of

   In measuring the current density of ER fluid composed of Ca-Ti-O
   particles, it was found that the conductive behavior of the fluid
   exhibits Poole-Frenkel character, which is one of the particular
   features for polar molecule dominated electrorheological fluids. By
   heating the Ca-Ti-O particles at 500 degrees C to remove the polar
   molecules adsorbed on the particles, however, the current density of ER
   fluid fabricated with pure Ca-Ti-O particles has linear dependence on
   the electric field approximately, same as in the traditional ER fluids.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design: Prospective longitudinal cohort study. Introduction:
   Increased use of computerized adaptive tests (CATs) to generate outcome
   measures during rehabilitation has stimulated questions concerning score
   interpretation.
   Purpose of the Study: The purpose of the study was to describe
   meaningful interpretations of scores from patient self-report shoulder
   functional status (FS) outcome measures estimated using a shoulder CAT
   (score range = 0-100).
   Methods: We applied four approaches to the clinical interpretation of
   outcomes data from 30,987 patients with shoulder impairments receiving
   outpatient rehabilitation in 518 clinics in 30 states (United States)
   between August 2007 and July 2009. First, we used standard error of
   estimates to construct 95\% confidence intervals for each CAT estimated
   score. Second, we estimated the percentile rank (PR) of FS scores.
   Third, we used two threshold approaches to define individual
   patient-level change: statistically reliable change (i.e., minimal
   detectable change or MDC) and clinically important change. Fourth, we
   developed and applied a functional staging model, the Shoulder Function
   Classification System (SFCS).
   Results: Precision of a single score was estimated by FS score +/- 4.
   Based on score distribution, 25th, 50th, and 75th PRs corresponded to
   intake FS scores of 43, 52, and 59 and discharge FS scores of 59, 68,
   and 80, respectively. MDC calculations indicated that changes in FS
   scores of 11 or more units represented statistically reliable change. FS
   score increments of eight or more units were estimated to represent
   minimal clinically important improvement based on receiver operating
   characteristic. The five-level SFCS was judged to be clinically logical
   and provide insight for clinical interpretation of patient progress.
   Conclusions: Results may improve clinical interpretation of
   CAT-generated outcome measures and assist clinicians using
   patient-reported outcomes during clinical practice.
   Level of Evidence: Therapy level 2c. J HAND THER. 2010;23:372-83.}},

   DB/SDS behave synergistically in both surface tension reduction
   effectiveness and mixed micelle formation at all mole fractions
   investigated. The values of adsorption area per surfactant molecule at
   air/solution interface were estimated, which provides some useful
   information on evaluating the interaction between DB and SDS in mixed

   tank which accelerates U-238(34+) to 0.54 MeV/u, the approach of
   Alternating-Phase-Focusing (APF) is applied. The phase array is obtained
   by coupling optimization software Dakota and beam optics code LINREV.
   With the hybrid of Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) and a
   pattern search method, an optimum array of asynchronous phases is
   determined. The final growth, both transversely and longitudinally, can
   meet the design requirements. In this paper, the deign optimization of
   the APF DTL is presented.}},

Abstract = {{A report by the Institute of Medicine suggested that more research is
   needed to better understand mold effects on allergic disease,
   particularly asthma development. We compared the ability of the fungal
   Penicillium chrysogenum (PCE) and house dust mite (HDM) extracts to
   induce allergic responses in BALB/c mice. The extracts were administered
   by intratracheal aspiration (IA) at several doses (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20,
   40, and 80 mu g) four times over a 4-week period. Three days after the
   last IA exposure, serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were
   collected. The relative allergenicity of the extracts was evaluated
   based on the lowest dose able to induce a significant response compared
   to control (0 mu g) and the robustness of the response. PCE induced the
   most robust response at the lowest dose for most endpoints examined:
   BALF total, macrophage, neutrophil, and eosinophil cell counts, and
   antigen-specific IgE. Taken together, our data suggest that PCE may
   induce a more robust allergic and inflammatory response at lower doses
   than HDM.}},

Volume = {{206}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have been unable to induce the Cutaneous Rabbit Effect
   (CRE) when the most likely perceived location of the illusory stimulus
   is on a non-continuous skin area. To determine whether the CRE could be
   elicited when each of the delivered stimuli were on non-continuous skin
   areas, we developed a new electrotactile stimulation paradigm attempting
   to induce the CRE across the fingertips. Though our stimulation paradigm
   differed from classic reduced CRE paradigms through the use of
   electrotactile stimuli, focusing the subject attention to a `likely'
   illusory site, and the inclusion of a fourth stimulation site (two
   stimuli after the illusory stimulus), these factors were not the cause
   of the illusory effect we observed. Experiments conducted on the forearm
   validated that our paradigm elicited similar results to those reported
   in previous CRE studies that used either 3-stimulation-point mechanical
   or electrotactile stimuli with subject attention focused on the `likely'
   illusory site. Across the fingertips, we observed an increase in
   stimulus mislocalization onto the middle fingertip, the `likely'
   perceived location of the illusory stimuli, under Illusory Rabbit Trains
   compared to the Motion Bias Trains. Because the Motion Bias Trains
   should not induce a perceived location shift of the illusory stimulus
   but stimulates the adjacent digits in a similar way to the Illusory
   Rabbit Trains, differences observed between their mislocalization rates
   between these trains indicate that the CRE can be induced across the
   fingertips. These results provide the first evidence that the CRE can
   `jump' when the stimuli occur across non-continuous skin areas.}},

Abstract = {{Water striders demonstrate an amazing talent which enables them to

   the nano/microscaled hierarchical architecture of individual seta using
   the Cassie-Baxter equations Here we show experimentally the strength of
   the contribution of the seta surface architecture to superhydrophobicity
   by maintaining identical surface chemistry (thin and thick coating of
   the setae with polychmethylsiloxane) Atomic force microscopy-based force
   and adhesion measurements of single uncoated and coated seta interacting
   with water quantitatively demonstrate the efficiency of the

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of aural

   instrumental jazz improvisation performance. A secondary purpose of this
   study was to investigate how achievement and self-efficacy may be

   consisted of collegiate instrumentalists (N = 62) enrolled as music
   majors at one of six Midwestern universities. All study participants
   received identical instructional materials but were assigned to one of
   two differing instructional modalities. Participants engaged in three
   70-minute instructional treatment sessions over 4 days and completed
   pre- and postinstruction improvisation performances that were evaluated
   by four expert judges using the researcher-constructed Jazz
   Improvisation Performance Achievement Measure. Self-efficacy was
   measured using the researcher-constructed Jazz Improvisation
   Self-Efficacy Scale. Results indicated a significant (p < .05)
   interaction effect for pre- to postinstruction and instructional method,
   with the aural instruction group demonstrating significantly greater
   gains than the notation group. Posttreatment achievement scores
   indicated nonsignificant correlations with experience variables.
   Participants' self-efficacy for jazz improvisation increased
   significantly (p < .001) following exposure to improvisation
   instruction; however, no interaction effect was found for instruction
   and mode of instruction.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate embryonic gene activation (EGA) is essential for the embryo's

   alpha 1, GJA1; transcription factor octamer 4, POU5F1 (OCT4);
   insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 and 2 receptors, IGF1R and IGF2R) was
   examined by RT-PCR techniques in preimplantation embryos obtained after
   in vitro maturation and IVF. Furthermore, influences of ICSI and sperm
   cryopreservation on the relative mRNA abundance in 4-5-days-old morulae
   were analyzed. Total RNA was obtained from immature and matured oocytes,
   2-cell embryos, 4-cell embryos, and 8-16-cell embryos, morulae, and
   blastocysts. RNA was transcribed into single-stranded cDNA by reverse
   transcriptase. After amplification, a nonfelid standard RNA was used for
   semiquantitative analysis. Our results showed an increase in transcript
   abundance from the matured oocyte to the 2-cell embryo for all examined
   genes except for IGF2R, indicating that, in vitro, the embryonic genome
   is activated shortly after fertilization. However, the activation
   pattern varied markedly between the different genes. We also found
   different patterns of mRNA expression for the examined genes in morulae
   produced either by IVF or ICSI, and using fresh or cryopreserved sperm.
   Owing to high variations within the single groups of compared morulae,
   we were able to observe only a tendency toward higher relative mRNA
   expression in embryos derived by IVF with fresh sperm in comparison to
   all other groups. Reproduction (2010) 140 531-540}},

Abstract = {{Spatial pooling is often considered synonymous with averaging (or other
   statistical combinations) of local information contained within a
   complex visual image We have recently shown however that spatial pooling
   of motion signals is better characterized in terms of optimal decoding
   of neuronal populations rather than image statistics (Webb et al 2007)
   Here we ask which computations guide the spatial and temporal pooling of
   local orientation signals in human vision The observers task was to
   discriminate which of two texture patterns had a more clockwise global
   orientation Standard textures had a common orientation comparison
   textures were chosen independently from a skewed (asymmetrical)
   probability distribution with distinct spatial or temporal statistics We
   simulated observers performance using different estimators (vector
   average winner-takes-all and maximum likelihood) to decode the
   orientation tuned activity of a population of model neurons Our results
   revealed that the perceived global orientation of texture patterns
   coincided with the mean (or vector average read-out) of orientation
   signals accumulated over both space and time To reconcile these results
   with our previous work on direction pooling we varied stimulus duration
   Perceived global orientation was accurately predicted by a vector
   average read-out of orientation signals at relatively short stimulus
   durations and maximum likelihood read-out at longer durations Moreover
   decreasing the luminance contrast of texture patterns Increased the
   duration of the transition from a vector average to maximum likelihood
   read-out Our results suggest that direction and orientation pooling use
   similar probabilistic read-out strategies when sufficient time is

Abstract = {{The role of sub seabed topographically controlled fluid migration is
   assessed to improve our understanding of distributions of acoustic
   chimneys at the Nyegga pockmark field on the mid-Norwegian continental
   margin. 3D seismic data interpretations resulted in topographic
   gradients of seismic time surfaces and RMS amplitude maps. Topographical
   gradient maps and flow tracing allowed identifying migration pathways
   and trapping locations for free gas within the shallow sub seabed. The
   occurrence of acoustic chimneys, pockmarks and mounds correlate with
   identified fluid migration pathways and gas trapping locations. An
   important factor that controls the trapping locations and the lateral
   distribution of seeps on the seabed at Nyegga is the variation through
   time of the depth of the base of the gas hydrate stability zone (BGHSZ).
   Fluids can derive from gas hydrate systems that are suspected of being a
   biogenic source and/or Tertiary domes that are considered to show
   leakage of thermogenic fluids to the shallow geosphere. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Flynn has proposed a grand integrative theory, which he calls
   ``scientific spectacles,{''} to explain the phenomenon of rising IQ
   scores across multiple decades known as the Flynn effect (FE). In his
   theory, he purports that modern society has placed increasing value and
   emphasis on the application and education of scientific principles-which
   include abstract fluid reasoning-and this has mirrored larger score
   increases in the abstract fluid reasoning tasks included as part of most
   intelligence tests. He highlights huge gains in the Wechsler
   Similarities subtest over time as one linchpin supporting his theory
   that fluid reasoning is rising faster than other aspects of
   intelligence, but further points to large increases in Wechsler
   performance tasks (i.e., perceptual organization and reasoning) relative
   to crystallized tasks, and to the many studies of Raven's Progressive
   Matrices, which is widely held to be a fairly pure measure of fluid
   reasoning. As with any new theory of this magnitude, Flynn's grand
   proposal has invited numerous criticisms that must now be addressed-and
   this is as it should be in the spirit of scientific progress. Each of
   these issues is multilayered and has many legitimate perspectives. The
   present article attempts to carefully consider each issue and
   perspective in sequence.}},

Abstract = {{CASE: Jacob is a 22-month-old wonderful boy, who is being seen a few
   months late for his 18-month-old visit because of scheduling snafus, as
   both parents work outside the home. At this visit, it is routine in our
   practice to administer the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers
   (MCHAT) and the Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS). On
   the PEDS, in response to the question, ``Do you have any concerns about
   how your child talks or makes speech sounds?{''} the parents respond
   ``He only says 2 words in Hebrew and none in English.{''} On the MCHAT,
   they reply ``no{''} to 3 items: (1) ``Does your child ever pretend, for
   example, to talk on the phone or take care of a doll or pretend other
   things?{''} (2) ``Does your child respond to his/her name when you
   call?{''} and (3) ``Does your child sometimes stare at nothing or wander
   with no purpose?{''} This results in failing 1 critical and 3 total
   items. Our practice protocol recommends a referral for a diagnostic
   evaluation.
   Jacob has been a healthy child, and this is the first time that his
   parents have fallen behind in routine health care maintenance visits.
   His medical history is unremarkable. He was born at term, weighing 3.2
   kg, without any perinatal complications. His parents had emigrated from
   the Poland in their teenage years and have been married for 8 years.
   They also have a 5-year-old daughter. They both report that, in Poland,
   there are some relatives who were ``very late talkers,{''} but they do
   not know about any definitive family history of autism.
   At the 15-month visit, the parents reported that Jacob had expressive
   jargoning but no recognizable words. They stated then that he was not
   interested in toys but liked to play with the television remote control.
   He is in full-time child care initially with a nanny in their home, but
   at 15 months started 3 days a week in a center-based childcare with many
   families from their community, where children speak Polish, English, and
   Hebrew at home.
   His mother works full time as an accountant and father as a physicist in
   a commercial laboratory. Both have graduate degrees and are trilingual.
   The parents are conflicted in their interpretation of Jacob's behavior.
   His father is concerned that he is autistic and his mother feels that
   ``he is just a little shy like me.{''}
   His physical examination is normal. He is somewhat inhibited and anxious
   but will sit still on the examination table and alone during the
   examination. You update his immunizations and then struggle with where
   to head next.}},

   necessarily Gaussian) in the large-system regime where the numbers of
   antennas at the transmitters and the receiver go to infinity with a

   decoding (JOD) at the central receiver, we also obtain asymptotic
   characteristics of a more practical system which performs separate
   detection and decoding (SDD) (i.e., spatial detection followed by a
   temporal error-correction decoder). Simulation results reveal that the
   asymptotic results provide promising estimates for the average
   performance metrics (e.g., the error probability and the MI) even with
   only a few antenna elements at the transceivers.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits of breastfeeding for the children's health have been
   highlighted in many studies. The innovative aspect of the present study
   lies in its use of a multilevel model, a technique that has rarely been
   applied to studies on breastfeeding. The data reported were collected
   from a larger study, the Family Budget Survey-Pesquisa de Orcamentos
   Familiares, carried out between 2002 and 2003 in Brazil that involved a
   sample of 48 470 households. A representative national sample of 1477
   infants aged 0-6 months was used. The statistical analysis was performed
   using a multilevel model, with two levels grouped by region. In Brazil,
   breastfeeding prevalence was 58\%. The factors that bore a negative
   influence on breastfeeding were over four residents living in the same
   household {[}odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, 90\% confidence interval (CI) =
   0.51-0.89] and mothers aged 30 years or more (OR = 0.68, 90\% CI =
   0.53-0.89). The factors that positively influenced breastfeeding were
   the following: higher socio-economic levels (OR = 1.37, 90\% CI =
   1.01-1.88), families with over two infants under 5 years (OR = 1.25,
   90\% CI = 1.00-1.58) and being a resident in rural areas (OR = 1.25,
   90\% CI = 1.00-1.58). Although majority of the mothers was aware of the
   value of maternal milk and breastfed their babies, the prevalence of
   breastfeeding remains lower than the rate advised by the World Health
   Organization, and the number of residents living in the same household
   along with mothers aged 30 years or older were both factors associated
   with early cessation of infant breastfeeding before 6 months.}},

Abstract = {{Endothelins (ETs) contribute to the sensory changes seen in animals
   models of inflammatory, cancer and diabetic neuropathic pain, but little
   is known about their nociceptive role following peripheral nerve injury.
   The current study evaluated mechanisms by which ETs can drive changes in
   nociceptive responses to thermal stimulation of the hind paw of rats
   induced by unilateral lumbar L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) injury.
   SNL sensitizes rats to acetone-evoked cooling of and radiant heat
   application (Hargreaves test) to the ipsilateral hind paw (throughout
   3-40 and 9-40 days after surgery, respectively). At 12 days after SNL,
   intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of endothelin-1 (ET-1, 10 pmol) induces
   greater overt nociception that was reduced only by treatment with the
   selective ETA peptidic antagonist (BQ-123, 10 nmol, i.pl), but unchanged
   by the selective ETB peptidic antagonist (BQ-788). Cold allodynia evoked
   by cooling the ipsilateral hind paw with acetone was reduced by i.pl.
   injection of both antagonists BQ-123 or BQ-788 (3 or 10 nmol). In
   contrast, heat hyperalgesia evaluated by Hargreaves method was reduced
   only by BQ-123. SNL enhanced the {[}Ca+2](i) increases induced by ET-1
   (100 nM) in neurons from L5/L6 (injured) and L4 (intact) cultured dorsal
   root ganglion, but did not change the responses of non-neuronal cells.
   Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that SNL increased ETA and
   ETB receptor protein expression in spinal nerves. Thus, SNL induces
   marked hind paw hypersensitivity to thermal stimulation in part via
   up-regulation of peripheral sensory nerve pronociceptive ETA and ETB
   receptor-operated mechanisms. (C) 2010 European Federation of

Abstract = {{Making it possible for people with Alzheimer's disease to retain a sense
   of identity during the process of the disease poses a great challenge to
   care-givers, professionals and family carers. The aim of this study is
   to elucidate the role of the view of life of People with Alzheimer's in
   framing their sense of identity. Is their view of life a vital aspect of
   their sense of identity? `View of life' was interpreted as a vital
   aspect of sense of identity, understood as the individual's beliefs
   about their life history and about the attributes that characterised
   them. Twenty-one people with mild to moderate stages of Alzheimer's
   disease were interviewed about their life story. The narratives were
   interpreted using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. By telling
   their life story, the participants also narrated their view of life,
   i.e. their conception of reality, their central system of values and
   their basic emotional attitudes. By their own accounts, the origins of
   the narrators' central values and basic emotional attitudes were
   established in early lift. They also expressed a sense of meaningfulness
   and continuity when looking back on their lives. The findings suggest
   that for a care-giver or confidant, having knowledge of a person with
   dementia's view of life is valuable when seeking to confirm that
   person's sense of identity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. To evaluate reader variability of white matter lesions seen on
   cranial sonographic scans of extreme low gestational age neonates
   (ELGANs).
   Methods. In 1,452 ELGANs, cranial sonographic scans were obtained in the
   first and second postnatal weeks, and between the third postnatal week
   and term. All sets of scans were read independently by two sonologists.
   We reviewed the use of four diagnostic labels: early periventricular
   leucomalacia, cystic periventricular leucomalacia, periventricular
   hemorrhagic infarction (PVHI), and other white matter diagnosis, by 16
   sonologists at 14 institutions. We evaluated the association of these
   labels with location and laterality of hyperechoic and hypoechoic
   lesions, location of intraventricular hemorrhage, and characteristics of
   ventricular enlargement.
   Results. Experienced sonologists differed substantially in their
   application of the diagnostic labels. Three readers applied early
   periventricular leucomalacia to more than one fourth of all the scans
   they read, whereas eight applied this label to <= 5\% of scans. Five
   applied PVHI to >= 10\% of scans, while three applied this label to <=
   5\% of scans. More than one third of scans labeled cystic
   periventricular leucomalacia had unilateral hypoechoic lesions. White
   matter abnormalities in PVHI were more extensive than in periventricular
   leucomalacia and were more anteriorly located. Hypoechoic lesions on
   late scans tended to be in the same locations, regardless of the
   diagnostic label applied.
   Conclusions. Experienced sonologists differ considerably in their
   tendency to apply diagnostic labels for white matter lesions. This is
   due to lack of universally agreed-upon definitions. We recommend
   reducing this variability to improve the validity of large multi-center
   studies. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Ultrasound 38:409-419,

Abstract = {{Background
   The principle of lifelong learning is pervasive in regulations governing
   medical education and medical practice; yet, tools to measure lifelong
   learning are lagging in development. This study evaluates the Jefferson
   Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning (JeffSPLL) adapted for
   administration to medical students.
   Method
   The Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning-Medical Students
   (JeffSPLL-MS) was administered to 732 medical students in four classes.
   Factor analysis and t tests were performed to investigate its construct
   validity.
   Results
   Maximum likelihood factor analysis identified a three-factor solution
   explaining 46\% of total variance. Mean scores of clinical and
   preclinical students were compared; clinical students scored
   significantly higher in orientation toward lifelong learning (P < .001).
   Conclusions
   The JeffSPLL-MS presents findings consistent with key concepts of
   lifelong learning. Results from use of the JeffSPLL-MS may reliably
   inform curriculum design and education policy decisions that shape the
   careers of physicians.}},

Abstract = {{Biochar is a potential tool in our fight against climate change, driven
   by its high carbon stability and supported by its roles in bioenergy and
   soil fertility. We consider methodology aspects of biochar systems used
   for carbon management and investigate the criteria for establishing
   additionality, baselines, permanence, leakage, system drivers,
   measurement, verification, economics and development for successful
   standalone projects and carbon offsets. We find that explicitly
   designing a biochar system around `true wastes' as feedstocks combined
   with safe system drivers could minimize unwanted land-use impacts and
   leakage. Applying baselines of biomass decomposition rather than total
   soil carbon is effective and supports a longer crediting period than is
   currently standard. With biochar production introduced into bioenergy
   systems, under a renewable biomass scenario, the change in emissions
   increases with higher fuel use, instead of decreasing. Biochars may have
   mean residence times of over 1000 years, but can be accounted for more
   effectively using a recalcitrant and labile fraction.}},

Abstract = {{Organomontmorillonites were synthesized by grafting cationic surfactants
   i.e quaternary ammonium compounds into the interlayer space and were
   characterized using XRD, FTIR and N(2) adsorption/ desorption analysis.
   The organomontmorillonites were applied as catalyst for the
   esterification of glycerol (GL) with lauric acid (LA). The catalyst
   which had symmetrical onium salts (tetrabuthylammoniumbromide, TBAB)
   gave higher activity than that of unsymmetrical onium salts
   (cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide, CTAB). Over the TBAB-montmorillonite
   catalyst, glycerol monolaurate was obtained with a selectivity of about
   80\%, a lauric acid conversion of about 71\% and a glycerol monolaurate
   yield of about 57\%.}},

Abstract = {{Correlations of computed Schottky constants (K(S)

   showed linear dependences of log K(S) on the lattice energies for the

   These findings suggest a basic relation between the Schottky constants

   parts of the Periodic Table, namely, Delta H(T,L)(0) = (2.303nRT log
   K(S))+2.303nRm(b)+2.303nRTi(b).
   Delta H(T,L)(0) is the experimental (Born-Haber) lattice energy
   (enthalpy), n is a constant approximately equal to the formal valence
   (charge) of the material, m(b) and i(b) are the slope and intercept,
   respectively, of the intercept b (of the log K(S) versus Delta H(L)(0)
   linear relation) versus the reciprocal temperature. The results of this

Abstract = {{Interest in agriculture for growth and poverty reduction reawakened in
   the early 2000s made all the keener by the sudden rise in cereals prices
   on world markets in 2007-08. But is it still possible to drive
   agricultural growth through small farms, as happened in the green
   revolution? Whether small farms have a future was debated at a workshop
   held in Wye, United Kingdom, in June 2005. It concluded that small farm
   development is not just desirable for poverty reduction, but also
   feasible, even in changing circumstances and particularly those of more
   concentrated supply chains with more demanding buyers. That said, while
   much that needs to be done is straightforward, such as provision of
   public goods, fostering the institutional innovations to allow small
   farmers to deal with the emerging supply chains will require patient
   work, tailored to specific circumstances.
   The future of all smallholders may well not lie in farming, but the
   measures to stimulate the rural nonfarm economy and provide jobs for
   those leaving fanning a favorable rural investment climate, provision of
   public goods, institutional development are largely the same as those
   for agricultural development as well. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{FEMINIST REVIEW}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{96}},
Pages = {{20-40}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This article explores aspects of the textual relationship between women
   and early modern London by examining three verbal `snapshots' of the
   city in works either written by women or focusing on women in their
   urban environment. The first text, Isabella Whitney's `Wyll and
   Testament' (1573), addresses London from a rural perspective, treating
   the city as a fickle male to whom she wants to hand back all his
   treasures. The poem constructs a vivid and ironic social topography,
   giving a glimpse of the roles of men and women in the Tudor city. The
   second text is by Mary Carleton, the roguish Restoration figure who
   defended her apparently `counterfeit' life in the prose of The Case of
   Madam Mary Carleton (1663). Carleton's London is a place of unwanted
   seduction and sexual intimidation, highlighting a gendered moral
   geography even while the memoir itself titillates the reader with the
   account of her bizarre experiences. Finally, in a coda to the
   discussions of Whitney and Carleton, early eighteenth-century London is
   viewed through Jonathan Swift's satirical mock-pastorals of squalid
   urban life, in which female identity, like the city itself, is a site of
   violence, disgust and deception. Together, these textual representations
   of women and early modern London indicate the complex interactions of
   gender, literature and the early modern city. The analysis of the texts
   also suggests the significance of the ironic voice as a quintessentially
   urban literary mode, the prevalence of the idea of woman as a
   commodified topographical site, and the function of metaphors of
   courtship or marriage as indicators of the paradoxical attractions of
   the city.}},

Abstract = {{Relatively little attention has been given to the effects of serial
   correlation of forecasts and observations on the sampling properties of
   forecast verification statistics. An assumption of serial independence
   for low-quality forecasts may be reasonable. However, forecasts of
   sufficient quality for autocorrelated events must themselves be
   autocorrelated: as quality approaches the limit of perfect forecasts,
   the forecasts become increasingly similar to the corresponding
   observations.
   The effects of forecast serial correlation on the sampling properties of
   the Brier Score (BS) and Brier Skill Score (BSS), for probability
   forecasts of dichotomous events, are examined here. As in other
   settings, the effect of serial correlation is to inflate the variances
   of the sampling distributions of the two statistics, so that uncorrected
   confidence intervals are too narrow, and uncorrected hypothesis tests
   yield p-values that are too small. Expressions are given for `effective
   sample size' corrections for the sampling variances of both BS and BSS,
   in which it can be seen that the effects of serial correlation on the
   sampling variances increase with increasing forecast accuracy, and with
   decreasing climatological event probability. The sampling variance of
   BSS is more robust to serial correlation than that of BS. Hypothesis
   tests based on BSS are seen to be more powerful (i.e. more sensitive)
   than those based on BS, and substantially so for lower-accuracy
   forecasts of lower-probability events, for both serially correlated and
   temporally independent forecasts. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal

Abstract = {{According to embodied theories of language, people understand a verb
   like throw, at least in part, by mentally simulating throwing. This
   implicit simulation is often assumed to be similar or identical to motor
   imagery. Here we used fMRI to test whether implicit simulations of
   actions during language understanding involve the same cortical motor
   regions as explicit motor imagery. Healthy participants were presented
   with verbs related to hand actions (e.g., to throw) and nonmanual
   actions (e.g., to kneel). They either read these verbs (lexical decision
   task) or actively imagined performing the actions named by the verbs
   (imagery task). Primary motor cortex showed effector-specific activation
   during imagery, but not during lexical decision. Parts of premotor
   cortex distinguished manual from nonmanual actions during both lexical
   decision and imagery, but there was no overlap or correlation between
   regions activated during the two tasks. These dissociations suggest that
   implicit simulation and explicit imagery cued by action verbs may
   involve different types of motor representations and that the construct
   of ``mental simulation{''} should be distinguished from ``mental
   imagery{''} in embodied theories of language.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To investigate changes in colour discrimination as a result of
   chronic hypoxic exposure induced by extreme altitudes (above 8000 m)
   during an expedition to Mt Everest.
   Methods Colour discrimination thresholds for tritan, protan and deutan
   axes were measured extensively in two male participants (four eyes)
   during an expedition to Mt Everest, using a quantitative, computer
   controlled psychophysical colour vision test (modified version of the
   Cambridge Colour Test). The tests were carried out over a period of 54
   days at altitudes of 1300 m, 3450 m, 4410 m, 5060 m, 5300 m, 6450 m,
   7200 m and 8000 m.
   Results Colour vision tests 1 week before and 6 months after the
   expedition indicated normal colour discrimination in both participants.
   With increasing altitude, colour discrimination thresholds were found to
   rise, predominantly for the tritan (blue) axes in both observers. Deutan
   (green) thresholds were minimally elevated at high altitude, whereas
   protan (red) was altered in one observer. Tritan colour discrimination
   thresholds decreased as a function of time spent at a given altitude and
   normalised upon return to low altitude.
   Conclusions Chronic hypoxia induced by high altitude exposure
   transiently affects colour discrimination, in particular tritan axis
   discrimination. Decreased tritan discrimination is partly reversible
   upon physiological adaptation to high altitude and completely normalised
   upon return to low altitude.}},

   content of SDC and SDC-LS was determined following extraction with 80\%
   acetone prior to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
   electronspray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and found to be rich
   in 5-caffeoylquinic cid, quercetin-3-galactoside, and
   quercetin-3-galactoside, and the proanthocyanidin dimer epicatechin. In
   conclusion, SDC-LS was associated with a favorable glycemic and
   insulinemic response in type 2 diabetics.
   Practical Application
   This study compares phenolic content and glycemic responses among
   different cranberry products. The study seeks to expand the palatable
   and portable healthy food choices for persons with type 2 diabetes. The
   novel use of polydextrose as a bulking agent making possible a reduction
   in caloric content and potential glycemic response is also characterized
   in this study.}},

Abstract = {{German anatomist Max Clara (1899-1966) described the ``Clara cell'' of
   the bronchiolar epithelium in 1937. The present article investigates
   Clara's relationship with National Socialism, as well as his use of
   tissue from executed prisoners for research purposes, details about both
   of which are largely unknown to date. Our methodology for the present
   study focussed on analysis of material from historical archives and the
   publications of Clara and his co-workers.
   Clara was appointed as Chair of Anatomy at Leipzig University (Leipzig,
   Germany) in 1935. He owed his career, at least in part, to Nazi support.
   He was an active member of the Nazi party (Nationalsozialistische
   Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP)) and engaged in university politics;
   this included making anti-Semitic statements about other academics in
   appointment procedures. Nevertheless, he also supported prosecuted
   colleagues.
   Much of Clara's histological research in Leipzig, including his original
   description of the bronchial epithelium, was based on tissue taken from
   prisoners executed in nearby Dresden (Germany).
   Max Clara was an active and outspoken Nazi and his histological research
   exploited the rising number of executions during the Nazi period.
   Clara's discovery is thus linked to the Nazi system. The facts given in
   the present paper invite discussion about the eponym's neglected history
   and its continued and problematic use in medical terminology.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of
   autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG) including serological
   diagnosis, clinical observations, pathophysiology, and treatment.
   Recent findings
   Classical AAG is a subacute disorder associated with antibodies against
   ganglionic acetylcholine receptors. Recent observations demonstrate that
   these antibodies cause a specific inhibition of synaptic transmission in
   autonomic ganglia and antibody levels correlate in a predictable way
   with severity of autonomic failure. Ganglionic acetylcholine receptor
   antibodies can be associated with other neurological disorders including
   chronic or restricted forms of autonomic dysfunction and with
   neurological or paraneoplastic disorders unrelated to the autonomic
   nervous system. Treatment of AAG is based on case reports. It is clear
   that AAG patients respond to immunomodulatory treatments but combination
   immunotherapy may be required to achieve a clinical response. Recently,
   additional clinical observations indicate that AAG patients may also
   show signs of treatment-responsive cognitive impairment.
   Summary
   The pathophysiology and varied clinical presentation of AAG are becoming
   more clear. AAG is a treatable antibody-mediated disorder of autonomic
   ganglionic synaptic transmission. Future studies will continue to define
   the optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approach to autoimmune autonomic
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced understanding of differential gene expression and biological
   pathways associated with distinct phases of intramembranous bone
   regeneration following femoral marrow ablation surgery will improve
   future advancements regarding osseointegration of joint replacement
   implants, biomaterials design, and bone tissue engineering. A rat
   femoral marrow ablation model was performed and genome-wide microarray
   data were obtained from samples at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 28, and 56 days
   post-ablation, with intact bones serving as controls at Day 0. Bayesian
   model-based clustering produced eight distinct groups amongst 9,062
   significant gene probe sets based on similar temporal expression
   profiles, which were further categorized into three major temporal
   classes of increased, variable, and decreased expression.
   Osteoblastic-and osteoclastic-associated genes were found to be
   significantly expressed within the increased expression groups.
   Chondrogenesis was not detected histologically. Adipogenic marker genes
   were found within variable/decreased expression groups, emphasizing that
   adipogenesis was inhibited during osteogenesis. Differential biological
   processes and pathways associated with each major temporal group were
   identified, and significantly expressed genes involved were visually
   represented by heat maps. It was determined that the increased
   expression group exclusively contains genes involved in pathways for
   matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), Wnt signaling, TGF-beta signaling, and
   inflammatory pathways. Only the variable expression group contains genes
   associated with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the notch signaling
   pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, and the B cell
   receptor signaling pathway. The decreased group exclusively consists of
   genes involved in heme biosynthesis, the p53 signaling pathway, and the
   hematopoietic cell lineage. Significant biological pathways and
   transcription factors expressed at each time point post-ablation were
   also identified. These data present the first temporal gene expression
   profiling analysis of the rat genome during intramembranous bone
   regeneration induced by femoral marrow ablation.}},

Abstract = {{Idealized three-dimensional numerical simulations are used to
   investigate the influence of sea breezes on the evolution of multicell
   thunderstorms in the Tropics. The study is motivated by a desire to
   understand a particular type of severe storm system that occurs
   occasionally over the `Top End' region of northern Australia, but the
   results should have wider applicability. The calculations are carried
   out using Bryan's cloud model.
   The simulations reproduce the main features of the evolution of an
   observed storm system. New cells develop on the gust front of the
   initial updraught, behind the sea-breeze front, and subsequently merge
   to form a multicell thunderstorm. The propagation speed and direction,
   the orientation, and length of the line of updraught cells are all
   similar to those observed. The sea breezes in the model play an
   important role in the evolution of the storm. In general, the low-level
   convergence at the gust front produced by the initial cell needs to be
   strong enough and to persist for a sufficiently long time to allow new
   cells to develop near this front. A strong cold pool occurs if the
   initial updraught is sufficiently tilted so that the downdraught does
   not fall into it, but supplies cold air close to the gust front. A
   generalized form of the Rotunno-Klemp-Weisman criterion was used to test
   whether the new updraughts developed at locations where the cold pool
   circulation was largely opposed by that of the environmental shear. The
   comparison of the shear components normal to the gust front showed that
   new cells develop even though this criterion is not fulfilled,
   suggesting that the criterion is not applicable to the more complex flow
   configurations studied here. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal Meteorological

Abstract = {{Invading alien species may have to await appropriate conditions before
   developing from a rare addition to the recipient community to a
   dominance over native species. Such a retarded invasion seems to have
   happened with the antipodean cirripede crustacean Austrominius modestus
   Darwin, formerly known as Elminius modestus, at its northern range in
   Europe due to climatic change. This barnacle was introduced to southern
   Britain almost seven decades ago, and from there spread north and south.
   At the island of Sylt in the North Sea, the first A. modestus were
   observed already in 1955 but this alien remained rare until recently,
   when in summer of 2007 it had overtaken the native barnacles Semibalanus
   balanoides and Balanus crenatus in abundance. At the sedimentary shores
   of Sylt, mollusc shells provide the main substrate for barnacles and
   highest abundances were attained on mixed oyster and mussel beds just
   above low tide level. A. modestus ranged from the upper intertidal down
   to the subtidal fringe. Its realized spatial niche was wider than that
   of the two natives. We suggest that at its current northern range in
   Europe a long series of mild winters and several warm summers in a row
   has led to an exponential population growth in A. modestus.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic granulomatous disease is a primary immunodeficiency, comprising
   five molecular defects, characterized by an impaired respiratory burst
   activity of myeloid cells. We are currently developing a gene therapy
   vector for the p47phox-deficient form of chronic granulomatous disease.
   Classic intracellular immunostaining of the cytoplasmic p47phox
   transgene product, however, interferes with respiratory burst activity.
   In this study we report a new system for measuring p47phox expression: A
   single open reading frame encoding the surface marker protein Delta
   LNGFR (truncated low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) linked to
   the p47phox transgene by the 2A oligopeptide coexpression technology.
   Translation generates two discrete products: p47phox localizing to the
   cytoplasm and `Delta LNGFR-2A' localizing to the cell surface. Six weeks
   after transplantation of transduced autologous hematopoietic stem cells
   into p47-/- mice, the intracellular p47phox fluorescence-activated cell
   sorting (FACS) signal intensities corresponded to surface Delta LNGFR
   staining in monocytes, B cells, T cells and Sca I+ bone marrow cells in
   vivo. The p47phox cleavage product restored nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase activity in granulocytes differentiated
   from transduced p47phox-/- murine hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo, in
   murine granulocytes/monocytes in vivo, and in transduced human monocyte
   derived macrophages from p47phox-deficient chronic granulomatous disease
   patients. In conclusion, this new marker system allows highly efficient,
   indirect detection of cytoplasmic transgene products by FACS surface
   staining. Gene Therapy (2010) 17, 1193-1199; doi:10.1038/gt.2010.73;

Title = {{Association of Matrix Metalloproteinase Gene Polymorphisms with

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of
   metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are involved in scleral extracellular matrix
   remodeling and have shown differential expression in experimental
   myopia. The genetic association of refractive error and polymorphisms in
   MMP and TIMP genes in Old Order Amish (AMISH) and Ashkenazi Jewish
   (ASHK) families was investigated.
   METHODS. Individuals from 55 AMISH and 63 ASHK families participated in
   the study. Ascertainment was designed to enrich the families for myopia;
   the mean spherical equivalent (MSE) refractive error (SD) was -1.61
   (2.72) D in the AMISH, and -3.56 (3.32) D in the ASHK. One hundred
   forty-six common haplotype tagging SNPs covering 14 MMP and 4 TIMP genes
   were genotyped in 358 AMISH and 535 ASHK participants. Association
   analyses of MSE and the spherical component of refraction (SPH) were
   performed separately for the AMISH and the ASHK. Bonferroni-corrected
   significance thresholds and local false discovery rates were used to
   account for multiple testing.
   RESULTS. After they were filtered for quality-control, 127 SNPs were
   included in the analyses. No polymorphisms showed statistically
   significant association to refraction in the ASHK (minimum P = 0.0132).
   In AMISH, two SNPs showed evidence of association with refractive
   phenotypes: rs1939008 (P = 0.00016 for SPH); and rs9928731 (P = 0.00026
   for SPH). These markers were each estimated to explain <5\% of the
   variance of SPH in the AMISH sample.
   CONCLUSIONS. Statistically significant genetic associations of ocular
   refraction to polymorphisms near MMP1 and within MMP2 were identified in
   the AMISH but not among the ASHK families. The results suggest that the
   MMP1 and MMP2 genes are involved in refractive variation in the AMISH.
   Genetic and/or environmental heterogeneity most likely contribute to
   differences in association results between ethnic groups. (Invest

Abstract = {{We report studies of preimplantation human embryo development that
   correlate time-lapse image analysis and gene expression profiling. By
   examining a large set of zygotes from in vitro fertilization (IVF), we
   find that success in progression to the blastocyst stage can be
   predicted with >93\% sensitivity and specificity by measuring three
   dynamic, noninvasive imaging parameters by day 2 after fertilization,
   before embryonic genome activation (EGA). These parameters can be
   reliably monitored by automated image analysis, confirming that
   successful development follows a set of carefully orchestrated and
   predictable events. Moreover, we show that imaging phenotypes reflect
   molecular programs of the embryo and of individual blastomeres.
   Single-cell gene expression analysis reveals that blastomeres develop
   cell autonomously, with some cells advancing to EGA and others
   arresting. These studies indicate that success and failure in human
   embryo development is largely determined before EGA. Our methods and
   algorithms may provide an approach for early diagnosis of embryo
   potential in assisted reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{In this territory-wide molecular epidemiology study of picornaviruses,

   month period, three novel picornaviruses, turdiviruses 1, 2 and 3 (TV1,
   TV2 and TV3), were identified from birds of different genera in the
   family Turdidae. In contrast to many other viruses in birds of the
   family Turdidae or viruses of the family Picornaviridae, TV1, TV2 and
   TV3 were found exclusively in the autumn and winter months. Two genomes
   each of TV1, TV2 and TV3 were sequenced Regions P1, P2 and P3 of the
   three turdiviruses possessed, respectively, <40, <40 and <50\% amino
   acid identities with those of other picornaviruses Moreover, P1, P2 and
   P3 of TV1 also possessed, respectively, <40, <40 and <50\% amino acid
   identities with those of TV2 and TV3 Phylogenetic analysis revealed that
   TV1, TV2 and TV3 were distantly related to members of the genus
   Kobuvirus Among the three turdiviruses, TV2 and TV3 were always
   clustered together, with high bootstrap supports of 1000 The genomic
   features of TV2 and TV3 were also distinct from TV1, including lower G+C
   contents, shorter leader protein and a preference for codon sequence NNT
   rather than NNC for amino acids that can use either NNT or NNC as codons
   (P<0.001 by chi(2)-test) Based on our results we propose two novel
   genera, Orthoturdivirus for TV1, and Paraturdivirus for TV2 and TV3, in
   the family Picornaviridae. The type of internal ribosomal entry site for
   TV1, TV2 and TV3 remains to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: A cranial nerve (CN) III palsy can be caused by a
   life-threatening aneurysm, typically of the posterior communicating
   artery. The ``rule of the pupil{''} states the majority (96\%) of such
   cases will present with abnormal pupil findings caused by compression of
   the fibers, located superficially along CN III. Careful examination of
   the size and reactivity of the pupils is critical.
   CASE REPORT: This case describes the complex management of a 79-year-old
   man with sudden-onset ptosis and diplopia consistent with a superior
   division CN III palsy. The pupils were normal, but because of the
   incomplete nature of the palsy the ``rule of the pupil{''} could not be
   applied, and an aneurysm remained a threat. After urgent testing,
   microvascular infarct was deemed the cause. However, the palsy failed to
   resolve after 3 months. Further investigation found myasthenia gravis as
   the final diagnosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Several important points are outlined regarding CN III
   palsies. First, lack of pupil involvement in an incomplete palsy is not
   equivalent to pupil sparing in a complete palsy. Second, after initial
   diagnosis, if subsequent findings are no longer consistent, further
   investigation is warranted. Lastly, myasthenia gravis should be
   considered as a differential in apparent palsy cases. Optometry

Abstract = {{The enzymatic activity of Bacillus subtilis glutamine synthetase (GS),
   which catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine from ammonium and glutamate,
   is regulated by glutamine feedback inhibition. The feedback-inhibited
   form of B. subtilis GS regulates the DNA-binding activities of the TnrA
   and GlnR nitrogen transcriptional factors. Bacterial GS proteins contain
   a flexible seven-residue loop, the Glu304 flap, that closes over the
   glutamate entrance to the active site. Amino acid substitutions in
   Glu304 flap residues were examined for their effects on gene regulation,
   enzymatic activity, and feedback inhibition. Substitutions in five of
   the Glu304 loop residues resulted in constitutive expression of both
   TnrA-and GlnR-regulated genes, indicating that this flap is important
   for regulating the activity of these transcription factors. The residues
   in the highly conserved Glu304 flap appear to be optimized for glutamate

Abstract = {{Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most potent gastric acid
   suppressing drugs available, and their use is widespread. An emerging
   concern about chronic PPI therapy is whether these drugs impair
   intestinal calcium absorption, resulting in a negative calcium balance
   and thereby potentially causing bone loss. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate the acute effect of the PPI esomeprazole or placebo on
   intestinal calcium absorption in healthy adults. Twelve young adults
   participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study.
   There were two 3-week interventions that included a 14-day adjustment
   period (designed to stabilize calcium homeostasis) followed by 6 days of
   a diet containing 800mg of calcium and 2.1 g/kg of protein
   (intervention). During the last 3 days of the adjustment period and
   throughout the intervention period, subjects consumed esomeprazole or
   placebo. Half the subjects underwent 24-hour continuous gastric acid pH
   monitoring. Intestinal calcium absorption was measured using dual-stable
   calcium isotopes at the end of each intervention. Treatment with
   esomprazole significantly increased gastric pH (mean pH on PPI 5.38 +/-
   0.13, mean pH on placebo 2.70 +/- 0.44, p = .005). Neither calcium
   absorption (PPI 34.2\% +/- 2.4\%, placebo 31.5\% +/- 2.1\%, p = .24) nor
   urinary calcium (PPI 321 +/- 38 mg/34 hours, placebo 355 +/- 37 mg/34
   hours, p = .07) differed between the PPI and placebo groups. It is
   concluded that short-term gastric acid suppression by PPIs does not
   attenuate intestinal calcium absorption in healthy young adults. (C)

Abstract = {{Polypropylene, polystyrene, high density polyethylene and their mixtures
   and real-world plastic waste were investigated for the production of
   hydrogen in a two-stage pyrolysis-gasification reactor. The experiments
   were carried out at gasification temperatures of 800 or 850 degrees C
   with or without a Ni-Mg-Al catalyst. The influence of plastic type on
   the product distribution and hydrogen production in relation to process
   conditions were investigated. The reacted Ni-Mg-Al catalysts were
   analyzed by temperature-programmed oxidation and scanning electron
   microscopy. The results showed that lower gas yield (11.2 wt.\% related
   to the mass of plastic) was obtained for the non-catalytic non-steam
   pyrolysis-gasification of polystyrene at the gasification temperature of
   800 degrees C, compared with the polypropylene (59.6 wt.\%) and high
   density polyethylene (53.5 wt.\%) and waste plastic (45.5 wt.\%). In
   addition, the largest oil product was observed for the non- catalytic
   pyrolysis-gasification of polystyrene. The presence of the Ni-Mg-Al
   catalyst greatly improved the steam pyrolysis-gasification of plastics
   for hydrogen production. The steam catalytic pyrolysis-gasification of
   polystyrene presented the lowest hydrogen production of 0.155 and 0.196
   (g H-2/g polystyrene) at the gasification temperatures of 800 and 850
   degrees C, respectively. More coke was deposited on the catalyst for the
   pyrolysis-gasification of polypropylene and waste plastic compared with
   steam catalytic pyrolysis-gasification of polystyrene and high density
   polyethylene. Filamentous carbons were observed for the used Ni-Mg-Al
   catalysts from the pyrolysis-gasification of polypropylene, high density
   polyethylene, waste plastic and mixed plastics. However, the formation
   of filamentous carbons on the coked catalyst from the
   pyrolysis-gasification of polystyrene was low. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{P>As new technology in the textile industry demands higher quality
   fibres, improving cotton fibre quality has become increasingly
   important. Twelve cotton lines selected from different breeding
   programmes with diverse fibre characteristics were used for this study.
   These lines and their F-2 hybrids were grown at the Mississippi State
   University research farm in three environments. Agronomic and fibre
   traits were measured and analysed by the additive-dominance genetic
   model. Significant additive effects were detected for all traits except
   seed cotton yield and fibre elongation. Dominance effects were
   significant for all traits. All MD lines and CS-B16 showed positive
   additive effects for lint percentage (LP), indicating that these lines
   can be used as general combiners to improve LP. MD90ne was a good
   general combiner for cotton yield. MD51ne, MD52ne, MD90ne and three
   derived day-neutral lines were associated with increased additive
   effects for fibre strength. Some F-2 hybrids with positive middle-parent
   heterosis for both yield and fibre quality were identified. This study

Abstract = {{Purpose: External beam radiotherapy (RT) is commonly indicated for the
   palliation of symptomatic bone metastases, but there is evidence of
   underutilization of this treatment modality in palliative care for
   cancer populations. This study was conducted to investigate factors that
   influenced the use of palliative RT services at a regional comprehensive
   cancer center.
   Methods and Materials: A cohort of patients with radiographically
   confirmed bone metastases and first-time users of palliative RT between
   2003 and 2005 was retrospectively reviewed from the time of initial
   diagnosis of bone metastases to death or last follow-up. Type of
   radiation treatment service provider used (rapid access or routine
   access) and patient-, tumor-, and treatment-related factors were
   analyzed for their influences on the number of treatment courses given
   over the duration of disease.
   Results: A total of 887 patients received 1,354 courses of palliative RT
   for bone metastases at a median interval of 4.0 months between courses.
   Thirty-three percent of patients required more than one RT course.
   Increased age and travel distance reduced the likelihood and number of
   treatment courses, while service through a rapid access clinic was
   independently associated with an increase in subsequent use of
   palliative RT.
   Conclusions: A rapid access service model for palliative RT facilitated
   access to RT. Travel distance and other factors remained substantial
   barriers to use of palliative RT services. The pattern of practice
   suggests an unmet need for symptom control in patients with bone
   metastases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Chitinases are virulence determination factors of entomopathogenic fungi
   which perform critical functions during degradation of insect cuticle.
   The present study was conducted to evaluate the biocontrol efficacy of
   fungal culture filtrate containing chitinase from M. anisopliae against
   P. xylostella. M anisopliae was cultured by submerged fermentation using
   colloidal chitin as sole carbon source. Maximum chitinase yield
   (105.32+/-1.19 mU/ml) was recorded at 96 h of incubation showing the
   ability of the culture filtrate to hydrolyse the colloidal chitin.
   Biocontrol assay against P. xylostella showed that the culture filtrates
   were potent antifeedants by reducing the feeding rate and body weight of
   the larvae. It reduced the successful pupation and increased larval and
   pupal mortality in a dosage-dependent manner when applied topically. The
   highest larval mortalities (67.89+/-3.11 \%) were recorded for groups
   treated with 600 mU ml(-1) chitinase activity. The maximum reduction in
   cuticular weight (75+/-1.34\%) and reduction in chitin content/larva
   (69+/-2.11) was also observed for the highest chitinase concentration
   (600 mU ml(-1)) tried. Our results showed that the culture filtrate
   containing chitinase from M. anisopliae are capable of negatively
   affecting the growth and metamorphosis of P. xylostella larvae. In view
   of the need for safer and environmentally friendly pest management
   tools, the present study can help in the development of enzyme-based
   biopesticides against P. xylostella.}},

Abstract = {{A 61-year-old woman presented with solitary lymphadenopathy suspicious
   for lymphoma. An excisional biopsy of a right inguinal lymph node
   demonstrated metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). No skin lesions
   were detected, but a primary nasopharyngeal mass was identified. A
   microscopic examination of the nasopharyngeal tumor and the lymph node
   metastasis showed a monotonous population of small- to
   intermediate-sized, round blue cells with vesicular nuclei, finely
   granular and dusty chromatin, and multiple nucleoli.
   Immunohistochemistry showed perinuclear dot-like staining for
   cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and CK20. Microscopic appearance and
   immunohistochemical stains were consistent with MCC. MCC was recently
   shown to harbor a novel polyomavirus, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV),
   in the majority of cases. In this case, MCPyV was detected in the
   primary tumor and metastasis using polymerase chain reaction and CM2B4
   immunohistochemical stain. This is the first report to demonstrate the
   presence of MCPyV and CM2B4 in a mucosa! MCC and its metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{The present study is to evaluate quality of life (QOL) among Chinese
   medical professionals and explore its main influencing factors.
   A total of 2,721 medical professionals were selected from two provinces
   by using stratified cluster sampling method. The Chinese version of
   Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) was used to measure QOL; Occupation
   Stress Inventory-Revised Edition (OSI-R) was used for occupational
   stress and coping resources. Other potential influencing factors for QOL
   were collected using a structured questionnaire. Multivariate analysis
   approach was applied to determine the influencing factors for QOL.
   QOL in the medical professionals was less desirable in comparison with
   the general population. Occupational stress, long working hour,
   occupation (being nurse), department (working in surgery) were
   unfavorable factors for PCS and MCS, and recreation, performance
   recognized, drinking and physical activity were protective factors for
   PCS, while rational coping, recreation, social support, performance
   recognized, drinking and physical activity were favorable factors for
   MCS.
   The results suggest that occupational factors, behavioral factors and
   coping resources, as well as age, play significant roles in QOL in the
   medical professionals. Accordingly, interventional program designed to
   target relieving occupational stress, adjusting behavioral habits and
   increasing coping resources may be useful to improve QOL among medical
   professionals.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency is critical for wireless sensor networks. The
   data-gathering process must be carefully designed to conserve energy and
   extend network lifetime. For applications where each sensor continuously
   monitors the environment and periodically reports to a base station, a
   tree-based topology is often used to collect data from sensor nodes. In
   this work, we first study the construction of a data-gathering tree when
   there is a single base station in the network. The objective is to
   maximize the network lifetime, which is defined as the time until the
   first node depletes its energy. The problem is shown to be NP-complete.
   We design an algorithm that starts from an arbitrary tree and
   iteratively reduces the load on bottleneck nodes (nodes likely to soon
   deplete their energy due to high degree or low remaining energy). We
   then extend our work to the case when there are multiple base stations
   and study the construction of a maximum-lifetime data-gathering forest.
   We show that both the tree and forest construction algorithms terminate
   in polynomial time and are provably near optimal. We then verify the
   efficacy of our algorithms via numerical comparisons.}},

Title = {{Temporal and spatial variation of stress field in Taiwan from 1991 to
   2007: Insights from comprehensive first motion focal mechanism catalog}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{The total amount of 4,761 focal mechanisms was determined based on
   P-wave first motion polarities from 1991 to 2007 in Taiwan region. This
   dataset offers us a good opportunity to examine temporal and spatial
   variability of the stress field We find that the spatial variations of
   stress axes are mainly controlled by tectonic structures while the
   temporal changes are greatly influenced by the Chi-Chi earthquake The
   orientation of the maximum horizontal compressive stress axes (Si) shows
   a general agreement with the direction of plate motion between a depth
   range of 0-30 km The 20 degrees anticlockwise rotation of S-H from the
   Longitudinal Valley (LV) to western Taiwan is probably caused by the
   left-lateral motion on the Longitudinal Valley Fault (LVF) that has
   consumed part of the oblique motion of plate convergence On the other
   hand, part of the oblique convergence is transferred into the Central
   Range and the Hsuehshan Range judging from counterclockwise rotation of
   S-H from east to west and strike-slip faulting in the Hsuehshan Range
   Most events with a depth greater than 30 km occur offshore eastern
   Taiwan and the azimuth of SH is close to E-W directed, different from
   NW-SE directed at shallow depths This may infer the existence of the
   transition of lithosphere rheology in offshore eastern Taiwan. The
   trends of Si, in the depth of 0-10 km are strongly affected by the
   coseismic stress change of the Chi-Chi earthquake In the northern half
   of the Chi-Chi rupture area, the trends of SH rotate 300 clockwise and
   the stress ratio increased by a factor of six after the mainshock The
   orientations of S-H still differ by 30 degrees in 2007 comparing to that
   in the period before the Chi-Chi earthquake The variation of SI, trend
   is more diverse in the southern half of the rupture area, showing 200
   counterclockwise rotation immediately after the 1999 mainshock followed
   by a clockwise rotation The trend of Si, returns to the pre-seismic
   direction of 110 degrees in 2001. These notable changes of S-H before
   and after the Chi-Chi mainshock suggests that the magnitude of
   background stress in the rupture area is close to the coseismic stress
   drop We also recognize a significant 10 degrees counterclockwise
   rotation of S-H in the entire Chi-Chi rupture area between 1991 and 1999
   before the earthquake took place. However, to the south of the Chi-Chi
   rupture, the trends of S-H remain little changed before and after the
   Chi-Chi earthquake. (c) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in pediatric

   recognized. We assessed the prevalence of CDI and recurrences in
   outpatients with IBD. In addition, the influence of IBD therapy on CDI
   and antimicrobial susceptibility of the potentially causative C.
   difficile strains was assessed. This was a prospective, single-center,
   observational study. All specimens were obtained between January 2005
   and January 2007 from the IBD outpatient service and screened for C.
   difficile and its toxins. C. difficile isolates were genotyped by PCR
   ribotyping. Diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
   (UC) was based on Porto criteria. Severity of disease was assessed using
   the Hyams scale (for Crohn's disease) and the Truelove-Witts scale (for
   ulcerative colitis). One hundred and forty-three fecal samples from 58
   pediatric IBD patients (21 with Crohn's disease and 37 with ulcerative
   colitis) were screened. The risk of C. difficile infection was 60\% and
   was independent of disease type (CD or UC) (chi 2 = 2.5821, df = 3, p =
   0.4606). About 17\% of pediatric IBD patients experienced a recurrence
   of CDI. All C. difficile strains were susceptible to metronidazole,
   vancomycin and rifampin. A high prevalence of C. difficile infection and
   recurrences in pediatric outpatients with IBD was observed, independent
   of disease type. There was no significant correlation between C.
   difficile infection and IBD therapy. PCR ribotyping revealed C.
   difficile re-infection and relapses during episodes of IBD in pediatric
   outpatients.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organisms affect plant growth and chemistry and have subsequent
   effects on aboveground herbivore performance. However, whether
   herbivores discriminate between plants exposed to different soil
   organisms when colonizing their host plants is largely unexplored. In a
   greenhouse study, Tanacetum vulgare L. (Asteraceae) growing in a ruderal
   plant community in the presence and absence of arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF) and earthworms {[}Aporrectodea spp. (Haplotaxida:
   Lumbricidae)] was colonized by aphids {[}Myzus persicae Sulzer
   (Hemiptera: Aphididae)]. The aphids preferred to colonize plants without
   earthworms in the soil, and the numbers of aphids remained lower on the
   plants with earthworms, irrespective of the presence of AMF. Although
   the N, C, and P concentrations of the shoots were not affected by the
   soil organisms, AMF increased total aboveground biomass, total N, C, and
   P content, and photosynthetic activity (measured as electron transport
   rate) in the leaves under high light intensity. These results suggest
   that earthworms affect chemical cues that are used by aphids to judge
   host quality prior to feeding. Discrimination between plants with and
   without exposure to earthworms by aboveground herbivores is a novel
   aspect of plant-mediated interactions between below- and aboveground

Abstract = {{In this paper, the synthesis of 1-hexyl-3-methylbenzimidazolium iodide
   (HMBI) and 1-hexyl-3-propylbenzimidazolium iodide (HPBI) was developed
   by quaternization reaction of 1-hexylbenzimidazole and alkyl iodide
   under solvent-free condition using Teflon-lined, stainless autoclaves.
   Their thermal properties were measured on the thermo gravimetric
   analysis and differential scanning calorimeter. The influence of HMBI,
   HPBI and 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII) on redox behavior of
   I-3(-) and I- was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy. It was found that the resulting HMBI and HPBI
   had high purity and the reaction time was shortened to 3 h. The thermal
   stability of HMBI and HPBI was better than that of alkylimidazolium
   iodides, and HMBI and HPBI were prone to exhibit the supercooling
   phenomena. The DSCs with HMBI, HPBI and MPII gave photoelectric
   conversion efficiency of 5.49\%, 5.34\% and 5.54\%, respectively. (c)

Abstract = {{A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar uses multiple antennas to
   simultaneously transmit multiple independent probing signals, and uses
   multiple antennas to receive the backscattered signals. The modeling of
   MIMO radar with transmit spatial diversity and coherent reception is
   addressed herein. The maximum likelihood (ML) method for parameter
   estimation using MIMO radars is considered, and two approximate ML
   algorithms are proposed. In the uniform noise scenario, one of the
   proposed algorithms performs similarly to the delay-and-sum beamformer
   which is optimal in the ML sense in single target case, while it
   outperforms the other proposed approximate ML algorithm at the cost of
   more computational load. In the non-uniform noise scenario, the proposed
   approximate ML algorithms both outperform the delay-and-sum beamformer.
   The efficiency of the proposed methods is validated by the simulation
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are among the most common causes
   of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. However, the
   differential roles of the three HRV species HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C in
   pediatric CAP are not fully understood.
   Objective: To determine the distribution of HRV species and their roles
   in children hospitalized with CAP in Beijing, China.
   Study design: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected between April 2007
   and March 2008 from 554 children with a primary diagnosis of CAP. HRVs
   in the clinical samples were detected by RT-PCR and by sequencing.
   Infections with other respiratory viruses were identified by PCR.
   Results: HRVs were detected in 99 patients (17.87\%). Among these
   patients, 51.52\% tested positive for HRV-A, 38.38\% for HRV-C, and
   10.10\% for HRV-B. HRVs were detected throughout the study period. The
   monthly distribution of HRV infections varied with HRV species. Median
   age, gender, symptoms, severity, and duration of hospitalization for
   single HRV-C infections were similar to those observed for single HRV-A
   infections. Co-infections with other respiratory viruses were detected
   in 57.58\% of the HRV-positive children. HRV/RSV dual infections were
   correlated with a higher frequency of shortness of breath (HRV-A group,
   P-2tail = 0.01; HRV-C group, P-2tail = 0.015) and lower median ages
   (HRV-A group, P-2tail = 0.049; HRV-C group, P-2tail = 0.009).
   Conclusion: Our study shows that HRV-C strains circulate at a prevalence
   intermediate between HRV-A and HRV-B. The severity of clinical
   manifestations for HRV-C is comparable to that for HRV-A in children
   with CAP. These findings point to an important role of both HRV-A and
   HRV-C in pediatric CAP. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although a variety of watermark-based image authentication schemes have
   been proposed so far, most of them have to leave some permanent
   distortions in the original Image for embedding the watermark
   information In this paper, we propose a novel reversible image
   authentication scheme to allow complete recovery of the cover image
   after the extraction of the embedded watermark In the embedding process,
   the original Image is partitioned into blocks, the chaotic watermark of
   each block is computed and embedded into the block Itself in a
   reversible way In the extracting process, the watermarked Image is
   partitioned into blocks; the embedded watermark of each block is
   extracted and the block Itself is fully recovered. Then we compute the
   new chaotic watermark of each recovered block and perform comparison
   with the extracted one Therefore, we can detect whether the original
   image is modified. If it, is, then the modification can be located
   Besides, by the use of chaotic watermark, the complicated nonlinear and
   sensitive dependence within image feature, secret key, and watermark is
   established to ensure the watermarking security. Theoretical analysts
   and computer simulation have verified the successful achievement of the
   proposed image authentication scheme}},

Abstract = {{Solid and hollow microspheres of LiMn2O4 have been synthesized by
   lithiating MnCO3 solid microspheres and MnO2 hollow microspheres,
   respectively. The LiMn2O4 solid microspheres and hollow microspheres had
   a similar size of about 1.5 mu m, and the shell thickness of the hollow
   microspheres was only 100 nm. When used as a cathode material in lithium
   ion batteries, the hollow microspheres exhibited better rate capability
   than the solid microspheres. However, the tap density of the LiMn2O4
   solid microspheres (1.0 g/cm(3)) was about four times that of the hollow
   microspheres (0.27 g/cm(3)). The results show that controlling the
   particle size of LiMn2O4 is very important in terms of its practical
   application as a cathode material, and LiMn2O4 with moderate particle

   populations that are not covered by previous studies. By combining these
   samples with a data set from our laboratory and the HapMap II samples,
   we assembled a final dataset of similar to 250,000 SNPs in 850
   individuals from 40 populations. With more uniform sampling, the
   estimate of global genetic differentiation (F-ST) substantially
   decreases from similar to 16\% with the HapMap II samples to similar to
   11\%. A panel of copy number variations typed in the same populations
   shows patterns of diversity similar to the SNP data, with highest
   diversity in African populations. This unique sample collection also
   permits new inferences about human evolutionary history. The comparison
   of haplotype variation among populations supports a single out-of-Africa
   migration event and suggests that the founding population of Eurasia may
   have been relatively large but isolated from Africans for a period of
   time. We also found a substantial affinity between populations from
   central Asia (Kyrgyzstani and Mongolian Buryat) and America, suggesting
   a central Asian contribution to New World founder populations. Published

Abstract = {{A new method for fabricating carbon fiber composite pyramidal truss
   cores was developed based on the molding hot-press technique. In this
   method, all the continuous fibers of composite are aligned in the
   direction of struts and thus, the truss structure can fully exploit the
   intrinsic strength of the fiber reinforced composite. The microstructure
   and organizations of fibers of fabricated composite structures were
   examined using scanning electron microscope. The crushing response of
   the truss cores was also investigated and the corresponding failure
   modes were studied and complemented with an analytic model of the core
   crushing response. Our results show that the fabricated low-density
   truss cores have superior compressive strength and thus, could be used
   in development of novel lightweight multifunctional structures. Crown

Abstract = {{Objective: Recently, the technique of high-resolution magnetic resonance
   imaging (HR-MRI) has been developed to depict intracranial artery wall.
   We aimed to compare the vessel wall properties between symptomatic and
   asymptomatic atherosclerotic middle cerebral arteries (MCA) using
   HR-MRI.
   Methods: We studied 26 patients with symptomatic and 35 patients with
   asymptomatic MCA stenosis. Routine cranial MRI, magnetic resonance
   angiography and HR-MRI were performed on each patient. The
   cross-sectional images of MCA wall on HR-MRI were compared between the
   two groups.
   Results: The degree of MCA stenosis was similar between the two groups
   (67.9\% vs 63.9\%, P = 0.327). On HR-MRI, eccentric plaques were
   observed in 26 (100\%) symptomatic and 28 (80\%) asymptomatic stenosis.
   In the remaining seven (20\%) asymptomatic stenosis, only constrictive
   remodeling (vessel shrinkage) was observed. Compared with the
   asymptomatic group, symptomatic MCA stenosis had a larger wall area (P <
   0.001), greater remodeling ratio (P < 0.001), higher prevalence of
   expansive remodeling (outward expansion of the vessel wall) (P = 0.003)
   and lower prevalence of constrictive remodeling (P = 0.008).
   Conclusions: Different vessel wall properties on HR-MRI were observed
   between symptomatic and asymptomatic MCA stenosis. Further prospective
   studies are required to investigate whether HR-MRI is a helpful tool in
   stratifying stroke risk in patients with MCA atherosclerotic disease.

Abstract = {{Earthquake is a complex multi-dimensional excitation. Counter-measures
   of such multi-dimensional excitation on many critical structures, such
   as long-span structures and high-rise buildings, must be taken into
   account to avert the structural failure. Many types of earthquake
   mitigation or isolation devices for mitigating earthquake-induced
   effects in the horizontal direction have been proposed and applied to
   real applications. However, study on multi-dimensional earthquake
   isolation and mitigation devices for structures has been received much
   less attention. In this paper, a new multi-dimensional earthquake
   isolation and mitigation device was developed and tested. Effects of
   excitation frequency and environmental temperature on horizontal
   properties of this device were considered. At the same time, fatigue
   properties of the device under different amplitude horizontal
   excitations were also studied experimentally. The equivalent standard
   solid model which can effectively describe the effect of frequency and
   temperature on the horizontal properties of the device was proposed and
   verified. From the experimental results, it may be concluded that the
   multi-dimensional earthquake isolation and mitigation device owns fine
   energy dissipation and fatigue resistance capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Repeated study improves memory, but the underlying neural mechanisms of
   this improvement are not well understood. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging and representational similarity analysis of brain
   activity, we found that, compared with forgotten items, subsequently
   remembered faces and words showed greater similarity in neural
   activation across multiple study in many brain regions, including (but
   not limited to) the regions whose mean activities were correlated with
   subsequent memory. This result addresses a longstanding debate in the
   study of memory by showing that successful episodic memory encoding
   occurs when the same neural representations are more precisely
   reactivated across study episodes, rather than when patterns of
   activation are more variable across time.}},

Abstract = {{Motion analysis of complex signals is a particularly important and
   difficult topic, as classical Computer Vision and Image Processing
   methodologies, either based on some extended conservation hypothesis or
   regularity conditions, may show their inherent limitations. An important
   example of such signals are those coming from the remote sensing of the
   oceans. In those signals, the inherent complexities of the acquired
   phenomenon (a fluid in the regime of fully developed turbulence-FDT) are
   made even more fraught through the alterations coming from the
   acquisition process (sun glint, haze, missing data etc.). The importance
   of understanding and computing vector fields associated to motion in the
   oceans or in the atmosphere (e.g.: cloud motion) raises some fundamental
   questions and the need for derivating motion analysis and understanding
   algorithms that match the physical characteristics of the acquired
   signals. Among these questions, one of the most fundamental is to
   understand what classical methodologies (e.g.: such as the various
   implementations of the optical flow) are missing, and how their
   drawbacks can be mitigated. In this paper, we show that the fundamental
   problem of motion evaluation in complex and turbulent acquisitions can
   be tackled using new multiscale characterizations of transition fronts.
   The use of appropriate paradigms coming from Statistical Physics can be
   combined with some specific Signal Processing evaluation of the
   microcanonical cascade associated to turbulence. This leads to radically
   new methods for computing motion fields in these signals. These methods
   are first assessed on the results of a 3D oceanic circulation model, and
   then applied on real data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The rectifying and interface state density properties of
   n-Si/violanthrone-79/Au metal-diode have been investigated by
   current-voltage and capacitance-conductance-frequency methods. The
   ideality factor, barrier height and average series resistance of the
   diode were found to be 2.07. 0.81 eV and 5.04 k Omega respectively. At
   higher voltages, the organic layer contributes to I-V characteristics of
   the diode due to space-charge injection into the organic semiconductor
   layer and the trapped-charge-limited current mechanism is dominant
   mechanism for the diode. The barrier height obtained from C-V
   measurement is lower than the barrier height obtained I-V measurement
   and the organic layer creates an excess physical barrier for the diode.
   The interface state density of the diode was found to be 1.70 x 10(11)
   eV(-1) cm(-2) at 0.2 V and 1.72 x 10(11) eV(-1) cm(-2) at 0.4 V.
   The obtained electronic parameters indicate that the organic layer
   provides the conventional n-type silicon/metal interface control option.

Abstract = {{Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are potent anticancer agents for
   variety of cancer types. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has been
   approved as a drug to treat cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and the
   combination of HDACi and other agents have been actively tested in many
   clinical trials. Adenovirus 5 early region 1A (E1A) has been shown to
   exhibit high tumor suppressor activity, and gene therapy using E1A has
   been tested in clinical trials. Here, we showed that proapoptotic
   activity of HDACi was robustly enhanced by E1A in multiple cancer cells,
   but not in normal cells. Moreover, we showed that combination of E1A
   gene therapy and SAHA showed high therapeutic efficacy with low toxicity
   in vivo ovarian and breast xenograft models. SAHA downregulated Bcl-XL
   and upregulated proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim, whose expression was
   further enhanced by E1A in cancer cells. These alterations of Bcl-2
   family proteins were critical for apoptosis induced by the combination
   in cancer cells. SAHA enhanced acetylation of histone H3 in Bim promoter
   region, while E1A upregulated Egr-1, which was directly involved in Bim
   transactivation. Together, our results provide not only a novel insight
   into the mechanisms underlying anti-tumor activity of E1A, but also a
   rationale for the combined HDACi and E1A gene therapy in future clinical
   trials. Oncogene (2010) 29, 5619-5629; doi:10.1038/onc.2010.295;

Abstract = {{Gastrointestinal stromal tumors have a wide spectrum of biologic
   behavior, and occasional cases show liver metastases. The modified risk
   grade based on tumor size and mitotic counts has been proposed to
   predict the biologic behavior in gastric gastrointestinal stromal
   tumors. Blood vessel invasion (BVI) is important in the development of
   metastasis of various kinds of cancer. The aim of this study was to
   elucidate the potential role of blood vessel invasion in gastric
   gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Blood vessel invasion was found in 17
   of 122 cases (13.9\%) of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and was
   significantly correlated with larger tumor size, higher mitotic count
   and higher modified risk grade. Among 83 cases of primary, localized
   gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors available for follow-up
   information, liver metastasis was observed in 14 cases (16.9\%). When
   blood vessel invasion was positive in the primary tumor, liver
   metastasis occurred in 80\% of cases after the initial surgery,
   indicating that blood vessel invasion was a significant risk factor of
   liver metastasis (P < .0001). In univariate and multivariate analyses,
   tumor size (>5 cm), mitotic count (>5/50 high-power fields) and blood
   vessel invasion (positive) were significantly associated with a shorter
   period of disease-free survival. Our results suggest that the evaluation
   of blood vessel invasion may be useful for predicting the risk of liver
   metastasis and aggressive biologic behavior of gastrointestinal stromal
   tumors, and may serve as important information for determining the
   therapeutic strategies including adjuvant molecular target therapy. (C)

   glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis due to a deficiency in the enzyme
   glucose-6-phosphatase. A patient with GSD Ia showed hypoglycemia and
   proteinuria without dietary management since early pregnancy. The
   patient's condition was complicated by hypertension with increase in
   proteinuria at 22 weeks of gestation. In spite of administration of
   antihypertensive drugs and dietary management, the disease became more
   severe with deterioration in the fetal status and inhibition of fetal
   growth. Thus, a cesarean section was performed at 26 weeks of gestation.
   The delivered male infant weighing 412 g died at 2 days after birth. The
   patient's blood pressure had normalized within 3 months after delivery,
   while proteinuria persisted.}},

Abstract = {{Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) has attracted much attention because of
   its therapeutic effects. In the present study, a new culture medium,
   which we designated Water medium, was developed to elucidate the effects
   of ERW on the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. Wild-type C. elegans
   had a significantly shorter lifespan in Water medium than in
   conventional S medium. However, worms cultured in ERW-Water medium
   exhibited a significantly extended lifespan (from 11\% to 41\%) compared
   with worms cultured in ultrapure water-Water medium. There was no
   difference between the lifespans of worms cultured in ERW-S medium and
   ultrapure water-S medium. Nematodes cultured in ultrapure water-Water
   medium showed significantly higher levels of reactive oxygen species
   than those cultured in ultrapure water-S medium. Moreover, ERW-Water
   medium significantly reduced the ROS accumulation induced in the worms
   by paraquat, suggesting that ERW-Water medium extends the longevity of
   nematodes at least partly by scavenging ROS.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of temporary immersion system (TIS) culture on the growth
   and quality of Siraitia grosvenorii plantlets were investigated. The TIS
   promoted the growth and quality of S. grosvenorii plantlets.
   Proliferation rate, shoot length, fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW)
   of shoots, and total biomass production were significantly (P a parts
   per thousand currency sign 0.05) higher in the TIS than in gelled and
   liquid medium, respectively. The TIS also decreased callus formation at
   the base of shoots. Callus diameter was significantly (P a parts per
   thousand currency sign 0.05) lower in the TIS (3.30 mm) than in gelled
   medium (6.31 mm) and liquid medium (6.77 mm), respectively. FW (50.83
   mg) and DW (7.08 mg) of callus in the TIS were also significantly (P a
   parts per thousand currency sign 0.05) lower than those in gelled medium
   (80.00 and 10.56 mg, respectively) and liquid medium (218.75 and 23.75
   mg, respectively). During rhizogenesis, minimal callus was evident at
   the base of shoots in the TIS, with a well-developed root system.
   However, the plantlets in gelled medium just produced thick, brown and
   easily broken roots with obvious callus and fewer secondary roots. The
   natural-like plantlets of S. grosvenorii obtained in the TIS would
   probably have positive effects on ex vitro rooting and transplanting in
   large-scale commercial production.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: To evaluate thin-section computed tomography
   (CT) images of the lung reconstructed using adaptive statistical
   iterative reconstruction (ASIR) on standard- and reduced-dose CT.
   Materials and Methods: Eleven cadaveric lungs were scanned by
   multidetector-row CT with two different tube currents (standard dose,
   400 mA; reduced dose, 10 mA). The degree of ASIR was classified into six
   different levels: 0\% (non-ASIR), 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, 80\%, and 100\%
   (maximum-ASIA). The ASIR (20\%, 60\%, and 100\%) images were compared
   with the ASIR (0\%) images and assessed visually by three independent
   observers for image quality using a 7-point scale. The evaluation items
   included abnormal CT findings, normal lung structures, and subjective
   visual noise. The median scores assigned by the three observers were
   analyzed statistically. Quantitative noise was calculated by measuring
   the standard deviation in a circular region of interest on each selected
   image of ASIA (0\%-100\%).
   Results: On standard-dose CT, the overall image quality significantly
   improved with increasing degree of ASIA (P <= .009, Wilcoxon
   signed-ranks test with Bonferroni correction). As ASIR increased,
   however, intralobular reticular opacities and peripheral vessels tended
   to be obscure. On reduced-dose CT, the overall image quality of ASIR
   (100\%) was significantly better than that of ASIA (20\%) (P <= .009).
   As ASIR increased, however, intralobular reticular opacities tended to
   be obscure. Using ASIA significantly reduced subjective and quantitative
   image noise on both standard- and reduced-dose CT (P < .001,
   Bonferroni/Dunn's method).
   Conclusion: ASIA improves the image quality by decreasing image noise.
   Maximum-ASIR may be needed for improving image quality on highly
   reduced-dose CT. However, excessive ASIA may obscure subtle shadows.}},

Abstract = {{P>We developed a method to determine the depth extent of low-velocity
   zone (LVZ) associated with a fault zone (FZ) using S-wave precursors
   from local earthquakes. The precursors are diffracted S waves around the
   edges of LVZ and their relative amplitudes to the direct S waves are
   sensitive to the LVZ depth. We applied the method to data recorded by
   three temporary arrays across three branches of the San Jacinto FZ. The
   FZ dip was constrained by differential traveltimes of P waves between
   stations at two side of the FZ. Other FZ parameters (width and velocity
   contrast) were determined by modelling waveforms of direct and
   FZ-reflected P and S waves. We found that the LVZ of the Buck Ridge
   fault branch has a width of similar to 150 m with a 30-40 per cent
   reduction in V(p) and a 50-60 per cent reduction in V(s). The fault dips
   70 +/- 5 degrees to southwest and its LVZ extends only to 2 +/- 1 km in
   depth. The LVZ of the Clark Valley fault branch has a width of similar
   to 200 m with 40 per cent reduction in V(p) and 50 per cent reduction in
   V(s). The Coyote Creek branch is nearly vertical and has a LVZ of
   similar to 150 m in width and of 25 per cent reduction in V(p) and 50
   per cent reduction in V(s). The LVZs of these three branches are not
   centred at the surface fault trace but are located to their northeast,
   indicating asymmetric damage during earthquakes.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) provides a novel opportunity for
   visualization of molecular ion distribution. Currently, there are two
   major ionization techniques, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
   (MALDI) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) are widely used for
   imaging of biomolecules in tissue samples. MALDI and SIMS-based IMS have
   the following features; measurable mass ranges are wide and small, and
   the spatial resolutions are low and high, respectively. To the best of
   our knowledge, this is a first report to identify the lipids in cultured
   mammalian neurons by MALDI-IMS. Further, those neurons were analyzed
   with SIMS-IMS in order to compare the distribution pattern of lipids and
   other derived fragments. The parameters which influence the
   identification of lipids in cultured neurons were optimized in order to
   get an optimum detection of lipid molecules. The combined spatial data
   of MALDI and SIMS supported the idea that the signals of small molecules
   such as phosphatidylcholine head groups and fatty acids (detected in
   SIMS) are derived from the intact lipids (detected in MALDI-IMS).

Abstract = {{Background Awareness of health risks of smoking is strongly associated
   with smoking behaviour. However, there are no population-based studies
   of smoking-related health knowledge in China.
   Objective The aim of current study was to use a population-based sample
   from the International Tobacco Control China Wave 1 survey to examine
   variations between current, former and never smokers' health knowledge
   about smoking and the impact of health knowledge awareness on smokers'
   intention to quit.
   Methods A face-to-face interview was conducted with 5986 adult smokers
   and non-smokers from six cities in China. Respondents were asked whether
   they believed smoking causes heart disease, stroke, impotence, lung
   cancer, emphysema, stained teeth, premature ageing in smokers and lung
   cancer in non-smokers. Current smokers were also asked additional
   questions on how smoking affects their current and future health as well
   as whether they had plans to quit smoking and if they believe they would
   have health benefit from quitting.
   Findings The overall awareness of health risks of smoking in China was
   low compared to developed countries. Current smokers in China were less
   likely than non-smokers and former smokers to acknowledge the
   consequences of smoking. Current smokers who were more aware of the
   health consequences of smoking were more likely to intend to quit
   smoking.
   Conclusion These findings highlight the need to increase awareness about
   the health effects of smoking in China, particularly among current
   smokers to increase quitting.}},

Abstract = {{A novel full-space scanning periodic phase-reversal leaky-wave antenna
   array is proposed, designed in offset parallel stripline technology, and
   demonstrated experimentally. This antenna radiates from its small
   phase-reversing cross-overs, which leads to a small leakage factor and
   subsequently a large directivity. The operation principle of the antenna
   is explained from the Brillouin diagram, which shows how single-beam
   scanning, using the m = -1 space harmonic, is achieved as a result of
   the pi lateral shift of the dispersion curves due to phase reversal. One
   of the benefits of phase reversal is to permit this radiation
   performance with relatively small permittivity substrates
   (epsilon(e,min) = 4 compared to epsilon(e,min) = 9 for antennas without
   phase reversal). An unit-cell matching technique is applied to avoid
   reflections, and thereby prevent the presence of an open stopband so as
   to permit continuous space scanning with efficient broadside radiation.
   An efficient array synthesis procedure, based on a transmission line
   modeling of the structure, is utilized for the design of the antenna
   following specifications in terms of frequency, scanning, directivity,
   radiation efficiency, and sidelobe level. A uniform-aperture antenna
   prototype, including a balun-transformer input transition, is presented,
   featuring experimental beamwidth and gain at the broadside frequency (25
   GHz) of 4 degrees and 15.7 dBi, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate potential roles
   of rapamycin, a macrocytic lactone produced by Streptomyces
   hygroscopicus, in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Methods:
   Male Wistar rats were pretreated with three different doses of rapamycin
   (0.25, 2, and 5 mg/kg). Then, isolated rat hearts were exposed to 40 min
   of global ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion using a
   Langendorff apparatus. Western blot analysis was used to examine changes
   in the expression levels of ERK1/2 and Akt kinases and LC3 -II/I (a
   marker of autophagy). The area of myocardial infarction and cardiac
   function were evaluated. Results: Our results demonstrated that
   rapamycin mediates cardioprotection in a dose-dependent manner in
   isolated rat hearts during myocardial I/R injury. Significant a
   autophagy was induced by rapamycin during I/R. Both, the mitochondrial
   K-ATP-channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) and the PI3K inhibitor
   LY294002 (LY) abolished the protection afforded by rapamycin completely,
   while the inhibitors alone did not influence the infarct size in control
   hearts. However, the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059(PD) and the blocker of
   autophagy 3-methyladenine (3-MA) had no effect on rapamycin-mediated
   cardioprtection. Conclusions: Cardioprotection afforded by rapamycin
   involves the PI3K pathway and the activation of mitochondrial
   K-ATP-channels, but is independent of rapamycin-induced autophagy. This
   study may have significant impact on clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background Clinical studies have shown that gene therapy is a promising
   approach for treating such genetic diseases as the eye disease, Leber's
   congenital amaurosis. Development of gene therapy approaches for
   treating chronic inflammatory diseases is, however, more challenging
   because it requires the production of anti-inflammatory molecules at the
   diseased tissues only when they are needed.
   Methods We designed such a system by modifying the human interleukin
   (IL)-6 gene promoter to direct transgene expression and delivered the
   system into cultured cells as well as mouse lungs using a
   helper-dependent adenoviral vector.
   Results We have demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that the reporter
   LacZ or human IL-10 gene can be induced by inflammatory stimuli.
   Conclusions The results obtained indicate that the inflammation
   inducible gene expression system based on the modified human IL-6 gene
   promoter has the potential to be used for developing gene therapy for
   treating inflammatory diseases. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This study empirically focuses on examining the hypotheses of export
   premium (exporters are more productive than non-exporters),
   selection-into-exporting (more productive firms are ones that tend to
   become exporters) and learning-by-exporting (new export market entrants
   have higher productivity growth than non-exporters in the post-entry
   period). The propensity score matching method is used to adjust for
   observable differences of firm characteristics between exporters and
   non-exporters, allowing an adequate `like-for-like' comparison. We also
   use the difference-in-difference matching estimator to capture the
   magnitude of different productivity growth between matched new export
   market entrants and non-exporters in the post-entry period up to two
   years. Drawing on 2,340 Chinese firms in the period 2000-02, we find
   evidence for export premium and self-selection, and once the firm has
   entered the export market there is additional productivity growth from
   the learning effect, in particular in the second year after entry.}},

Abstract = {{Some regular raised strips are often introduced into
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices for avoiding the stiction

   evaluate the squeeze-film damping of MEMS suspension structure with

   These raised strips cause a non-smooth pressure distribution between the
   moving and the fixed plates. The damping coefficients against distance
   between two plates with (and without) raised strips are also
   theoretically obtained by this analytical model. The two kinds of
   typical suspension microstructures have been fabricated by surface
   microelectroplating. Their vibration decay curves have been tested by
   laser detector. Calculated damping coefficients by amplitude envelopes
   are, respectively, about 0.34 and 0.05 N s/m when the moving plate
   reaches its initial position, which are in accordance with theoretical
   ones.}},

   Histological and biochemical analysis showed that the ACM was devoid of

   of cartilage. Scanning electronic microscopy and mercury intrusion
   porosimetry showed that the ACM had a sponge-like structure of high
   porosity. The ACM scaffold had good biocompatibility with cultured
   rabbit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells with no indication of
   cytotoxicity both in contact and in extraction assays. The cartilage
   defects repair in rabbit knees with the mesenchymal stem cell-ACM
   constructs had a significant improvement of histological scores when

Abstract = {{Purpose: C-arm based cone-beam CT (CBCT) has been recently introduced as
   an in-situ 3D soft tissue imaging modality. When combined with
   image-guided navigation, it provides a streamlined clinical workflow
   with, potentially, improved interventional accuracy. A key component in
   these systems is image to patient registration. The most common
   registration method relies on fiducial markers placed on the patient's
   skin. The fiducials are localized in the volumetric image and in the
   interventional environment. When using C-arm CBCT, the small spatial
   extent of the volumetric reconstruction makes this registration approach
   challenging, as the volume must include both the anatomy of interest and
   the fiducials. The authors have previously proposed a semiautomatic
   localization approach that addresses this challenge, with evaluation
   carried out using anthropomorphic phantoms. To truly evaluate the
   algorithm's utility, the evaluation must be carried out using clinical
   data. In this article, the authors extend the evaluation of the approach
   to data sets acquired in a clinical trial.
   Methods: Nine CBCT data sets were obtained in three interventional
   radiology procedures as part of a clinical trial evaluating a commercial
   navigation system. Fiducials were localized in the volumetric coordinate
   system directly from the projection images using the evaluated
   localization approach. Localization was assessed using two quality
   measures fiducial registration error to quantify precision and fiducial
   localization error to quantify accuracy. The fiducials used in this
   study are 6 mm spheres embedded in a custom registration phantom used by
   the navigation system.
   Results: In all cases, the proposed approach was able to localize all
   five fiducial markers embedded in the registration phantom. The
   approach's mean (std) fiducial registration error was 0.29 (0.13) mm.
   The mean (std) localization difference as compared to direct volumetric
   localization was 0.82 (0.34) mm.
   Conclusions: Based on the current evaluation using data from clinical
   cases, the authors conclude that the localization approach is
   sufficiently accurate for use in thoracic-abdominal interventions, and
   that it can simplify the current workflow while reducing cumulative
   radiation to the patient due to repeated CBCT scans. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Mesh partitioning approach, widely used in 3-D meshes compression and

   the partition boundary of stego-mesh with a small amount of additional
   data The face normal principal component analysis is employed to
   determine the meshes' canonical positions Some additional scattered
   information from the elevation of cover-mesh in canonical coordinate
   systems, instead of the presence of the cover-mesh, is picked up to
   match the elevation of stego-mesh With the aim to realign the stego-mesh
   approximately and plot out the partition boundary, the deflected degree

Abstract = {{Background: Neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane combinations, with or
   without gemcitabine, produce pathologic complete responses (pCRs) in
   15\%-25\% of patients. In this multicenter phase II study, we attempted
   to increase efficacy and decrease toxicity of a 3-drug
   gemcitabine-containing neoadjuvant regimen by administering dose-dense
   therapy with pegfilgrastim, and including albumin-bound paclitaxel as
   the taxane. Patients and Methods: A total of 123 patients with locally
   advanced breast cancer were enrolled. Patients were treated with 6 doses
   of neoadjuvant gemcitabine 2000 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2), and
   albumin-bound paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) intravenously administered at
   14-day intervals. Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients underwent
   either mastectomy or breast conservation surgery; pathologic response to
   treatment was assessed. Postoperatively, patients received 4 doses of
   gemcitabine 2000 mg/m(2) with albumin-bound paclitaxel 220 mg/m(2) at
   14-day intervals. Pegfilgrastim 6 mg was administered subcutaneously on
   day 2 following each dose of chemotherapy. Results: A total of 116
   patients (95\%) completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had subsequent
   surgical resection. Twenty-three patients (20\%) had a pCR. The
   estimated 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
   rates were 48\% and 86\%, respectively. Neoadjuvant treatment was well
   tolerated; only 11\% of the patients had grade 3/4 neutropenia, with 1
   episode of neutropenic fever. Other grade 3/4 toxicities occurred in
   <10\% of the patients. Conclusion: Neoadjuvant biweekly chemotherapy
   with gemcitabine/epirubicin/albumin-bound paclitaxel with pegfilgrastim
   is feasible and well tolerated. The pCR rate of 20\% and the 3-year PFS
   rate of 48\% are similar to results achieved with other commonly used
   neoadjuvant regimens.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates uptake of cesium and strontium from aqueous
   solution similar to nuclear waste on three samples of titanium
   molybdophosphate (TMP) synthesized under various conditions. Effects of
   concentration of sodium nitrate, pH and contact time on the uptake of
   cesium and strontium have been studied by bath method. The results
   showed that TMP has high affinity toward cesium and strontium at pH > 2
   and relatively low concentration of sodium nitrate. Kinetic data
   indicated that cesium uptake process to achieve equilibrium was faster
   than strontium. Cesium and strontium breakthrough curves were examined
   at 25 A degrees C using column packed with H3O+ form of TMP and
   breakthrough curves showed symmetrical S-shaped profiles. At the same
   time, the calculated breakthrough capacity for cesium was higher than
   strontium. The results of desorption studies showed that over 99\% of
   cesium and strontium was washed out of column by using 4 M NH4Cl
   solution. This study suggests that TMP can have great potential
   applications for the removal of strontium and specially cesium from

Abstract = {{Recent developments in large scale stirred milling technology using
   ceramic media have allowed its application to relatively coarse particle
   streams. Apart from benefits in grinding finer more efficiently,
   benefits may also be derived from the surface cleaning action of stirred
   mills. This paper discusses evidence for the cleaning action of a
   stirred mill on the surfaces of chalcocite and effects on its subsequent
   flotation. Single mineral samples of chalcocite were ground with either
   stainless or mild steel grinding media. The effects of surface
   contamination by iron hydroxide on chalcocite floatability were studied
   using ethylene diamine-tetra acetic acid (EDTA) extraction, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) surface analysis and contact angle
   measurements. Depression of both coarse (+75 mu m) and fine (-10 mu m)
   size fractions was attributed to the surface precipitation of iron
   hydroxide species. Transfer of iron hydroxides from coarse particles to
   fine particles was observed with XPS analysis. Recovery of coarse
   particles (+75 mu m) was improved by attritioning, while additional
   collector was needed to fully restore chalcocite recovery in both fine
   and coarse size fractions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The floristic and structural dynamics of moist tropical forests
   following degradation remain largely unknown. Nonetheless, understanding
   these dynamics is vital in the current context of forest carbon and
   biodiversity issues. The Tene plot (Cote d'Ivoire) is a forest research
   device set up in 1978 to study, in the long term, the dynamics of
   species with a commercial value. In 1983, the plots were accidentally
   burned, and more than 65\% of the total area was affected. The objective
   of this study is to evaluate the impact of forest silviculture in
   combination with fire on stand structure and floristic composition. The
   structural and floristic variations were tested respectively using a
   simple model of ANCOVA and an ordination. The results obtained show that
   the impact of fire, in terms of burned surface, structure, and floristic
   composition, was significantly increased by the disturbance induced by
   the forestry treatments. These results show that silvicultural
   treatments presumably favourable to species with a commercialization
   potential can increase susceptibility to fires and cause long-term
   effects on forests' structure and floristic composition.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Aims and objectives.
   To describe long-term care nursing directors' experiences with
   percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy to understand the limited use of it
   in Taiwanese long-term care facilities.
   Background.
   Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes, used in Western countries
   since 1980, have not been readily used in Taiwanese long-term care
   facilities since their introduction in 1995. Instead, nasogastric tubes
   are used for extended periods. The reasons for limited percutaneous
   endoscopic gastrostomy use among long-term care residents are unknown.
   Design.
   A phenomenologic qualitative design using in-depth semi-structured
   interviews collected the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use
   experiences of directors of long-term care facilities. The directors
   also provided descriptive data on the prevalence of feeding tubes among
   their residents.
   Methods.
   Eight directors of long-term care facilities in southern Taiwan
   participated in tape-recorded interviews. Data were thematically
   analysed using the methods of Strauss and Corbin. Feeding tube
   prevalence data were analysed using descriptive statistics.
   Results.
   Four themes emerged as contributing to limited percutaneous endoscopic
   gastrostomy use in long-term care facilities: acceptability,
   availability, affordability and accountability. Over one-third of the
   residents required feeding tubes with 97\% of those having nasogastric
   tube. Nasogastric tubes were used for a year or more in over half of the
   patients requiring enteral feeding.
   Conclusion.
   Chinese cultural values play a significant role in influencing
   end-of-life care and decisions about percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
   use. Nursing directors in long-term care assume a gatekeeper role to
   promote acceptability, provide availability and ensure accountability of
   nutritional interventions. Policy makers must be engaged to promote the
   affordability of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use among long-term
   care residents.
   Relevance to clinical practice.
   To improve nutritional outcomes among long-term care residents, nurses
   must acknowledge the Chinese culture related to percutaneous endoscopic
   gastrostomy tubes. Professionals must provide sufficient information
   about the advantages of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes and
   discuss with families the meaning of quality of life and suffering at
   the end-of-life.}},

   community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the GenIMS study (n=1895) and on
   mortality following either CAP or non-infectious hospitalisations in the
   population-based cohort study, Health ABC (n=1639) was determined.
   Measurements included the mortality rate within the first year, risk of
   organ dysfunction, and immune responses, including circulating
   inflammatory (tumour necrosis factor, interleukin 6, interleukin 10),
   coagulation (Factor IX, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, antithrombin),
   fibrinolysis (plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 and D-dimer) and cell
   surface markers (CD120a, CD120b, human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR,
   Toll-like receptor-2 and Toll-like receptor-4).
   Results In GenIMS, diabetes increased the mortality rate within the
   first year after CAP (unadjusted HR 1.41, 95\% CI 1.12 to 1.76,
   p=0.002), even after adjusting for pre-existing cardiovascular and renal
   disease (adjusted HR 1.3, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.65, p=0.02). In Health ABC,
   diabetes increased the mortality rate within the first year following
   CAP hospitalisation, but not after hospitalisation for non-infectious
   illnesses (significant interaction for diabetes and reason for
   hospitalisation (p=0.04); HR for diabetes on mortality over the first
   year after CAP 1.87, 95\% CI 0.76 to 4.6, p=0.16, and after
   non-infectious hospitalisation 1.16, 95\% CI 0.8 to 1.6, p=0.37). In
   GenIMS, immediate immune response was similar, as evidenced by similar
   circulating immune marker levels, in the emergency department and during
   the first week. Those with diabetes had a higher risk of acute kidney
   injury during hospitalisation (39.3\% vs 31.7\%, p-0.005) and they were
   more likely to die due to cardiovascular and kidney disease (34.4\% vs
   26.8\% and 10.4\% vs 4.5\%, p=0.03).
   Conclusions Pre-existing diabetes was associated with a higher risk of
   death following CAP. The mechanism is not due to an altered immune
   response, at least as measured by a broad panel of circulating and cell
   surface markers, but may be due to worsening of pre-existing
   cardiovascular and kidney disease.}},

Abstract = {{The batch flotation process has been commonly characterized assuming a
   flotation rate distribution function F(k), e.g.: Dirac delta,
   Rectangular, Gamma or Weibull functions. The identification of F(k) for
   the collection zone of continuous industrial cells is more complex and
   to the authors knowledge, has not been reported yet.
   In this work, a novel procedure to estimate the flotation rate
   distribution from the collection zone of industrial flotation cells,
   using the radioactive tracer technique, is presented. The approach
   consists of measuring the impulse response of the floatable mineral
   tracer concentration, and non-floatable gangue tracer concentration
   (Residence Time Distribution, RTD), in the cell tailings. Then, the
   floatable tracer concentration can be compared with the model
   prediction, using the Gamma function and the RTD of the non-floatable
   tracer. Thus, the F(k) distribution parameters were obtained by means of
   the least-square estimation. The new approach was successfully tested in
   industrial rougher flotation cells of large size. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The State of Sao Paulo is the most developed area in Brazil and was
   impacted by persistent organic pollutants for several decades. This
   study investigated organochlorines in five species of small cetaceans
   (Pontoporia blainvillei, Stenella frontalis, Sotalia guianensis,
   Tursiops truncatus and Steno bredanensis) found dead along the coast of
   Sao Paulo between 1997 and 2003. DDTs (15.9 mu g g(-1) lipid: mean for
   all pooled individuals) and PCBs (8.08 mu g g(-1)) exhibited the highest
   concentrations in the animals, reflecting large amounts formerly used in
   Brazil. Lower levels of mirex (0.149 mu g g(-1)), HCB (0.051 mu g
   g(-1)), CHLs (0.008 mu g g(-1)) and HCHs (0.007 mu g g(-1)) were
   detected in all species. Residual pattern of DDTs in dolphins suggests
   that o,p'-DDT is more recalcitrant than p,p'-DDT in the body of the
   animals and/or the environment. In contrast to p,p'-DDT, residues of
   o,p'-DDT seem to be preferentially converted into o,p'-DDD rather than
   op-DDE. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The study was conducted in West Mediterranean Agricultural Research
   Institute's fields of Antalya at 2008-2009 to evaluate character
   associations using correlation coefficients, path and factor analyses
   with 345 sesame accessions originating from 29 different sesame
   producing countries covering worldwide. The correlation coefficient
   analysis indicated that plant height, number of branches, number of
   capsules per plant and 1000 seed weight had the significant positive
   effect on seed yield. The characters related to maturity, days to first
   flowering and 50\% flowering, showed negative correlation with seed
   yield. The path coefficient analysis based on seed yield, as a dependent
   variable implicated that plant height had the highest positive direct
   effect on seed yield. This character was followed by days to first
   flowering, number of capsules and 1000 seed weight. Number of branches
   and number of capsules per plant had powerful indirect effect over plant
   height on seed yield. The overall results demonstrated that plant
   height, number of capsules per plant, number of branches and 1000 seed
   weight were the most contributing characters on sesame seed yield and
   these characters was of great importance in making indirect selection
   for seed yield. Factor analysis divided the 9 measured variables into 3
   factors and these three factors had close contributions. Factor 1
   (22.73\%) strongly influenced days to first flowering and days to 50\%
   flowering. Second factor (18.82\%) was affected strongly by stem length
   to first capsule and plant height. Third factor (18.72\%) was associated
   with number of capsules per plant, number of branches, seed yield and
   1000 seed weight. According to factor analysis, plant height, number of
   branches and number of capsules per plant were the important attributes
   in sesame. Three different analyses proposed that sesame breeding for
   higher seed yield could be based on these characters as selection
   criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the factors affecting
   eating attitude of female undergraduates according to BMI. Methods: A
   descriptive survey design with a convenience sampling was used and data
   collection was done using a self-report questionnaire answered by 406
   female undergraduates from four universities located in Seoul, Kangwon,
   Gyeongsangbuk and Chungcheongnam Provinces. ANOVA, Pearson correlation
   coefficients, and hierarchial multiple regression were used the SPSS WIN
   17.0 Program to analyze the data. Results: With respect to BMI, the
   students were found to be in 3 groups, whose differences in eating
   attitude were significant. Eating attitude had significant positive
   correlation with height (r=.118, p=.017), weight (r=.267, p<.000), BMI
   (r=.239, p<.001), and depression (r=.375, p<.001), and negative
   correlation with subjective well-being (r=-.153, p=.002) and body esteem
   (r=-.287, p<.001). In the hierarchial multiple regression analysis,
   college major, height, weight and religion, were controlled. Depression
   and body esteem regarding weight significantly predicted 40.7\% of
   eating attitude for the underweight group and normal weight group body
   esteem: weight and depression were significant predictors for 27.5\% of
   eating attitude for the normal weight group. Body esteem: weight
   explained 32.6\% of eating attitude for the overweight group.
   Conclusion: Findings of this study allow a comprehensive understanding
   of eating attitudes and related factors among female undergraduates in
   Korea. Further study with a larger random sample from various
   universities is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors suppress bone repair and bone
   formation by suppressing angiogenesis as well as potentially interfering
   with osteoblast and osteoclast functions. In spite of these reports,
   there is a controversy over the exact effects of COX-2 inhibitors on
   bone formation processes itself. This work was designed to investigate
   the effect of COX-2 inhibitor on osteogenesis of human bone
   marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). MSCs in osteogenesis were
   treated with COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib and naproxen) in the absence or
   presence of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), which was used to induce
   inflammation. Following differentiation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and
   calcium contents of IL-1 beta-treated MSC were significantly reduced by
   high doses of COX-2 inhibitors compared with the low-dose group.
   However, in non-inflammatory-conditioned MSCs, ALP and calcium contents
   were not reduced by COX-2 inhibitors. The mRNA expression of Runx2/Cbf
   alpha 1, Dlx5, and osteocalcin was also decreased by COX-2 inhibitors in
   inflammatory-conditioned MSCs and showed a significant decrease for the
   high dose while they remained constant in the
   non-inflammatory-conditioned MSCs. These data indicate that the
   osteogenic potential of MSC is inhibited/delayed by the treatment of
   high-dose NSAIDs under inflammatory conditions.}},

Abstract = {{It is a business practice that home shopping companies offer a free
   trial period for their products with a goal of increasing sales. Under
   this policy, if for any reason customers are not satisfied with the
   purchase, they can return the product for a refund within the trial
   period. To develop inventory strategies in such environment, home
   shopping companies should take the return phenomenon into account so as
   to increase their profit. This paper considers this phenomenon and
   develops a seasonal inventory model to deal with the problem. Two
   scenarios are analyzed. In the first scenario, demand is assumed to be
   linearly price-dependent while in the second one, it is assumed to be
   exponentially price-dependent. The purpose of this research is to
   maximize the total profit over a given planning period by determining
   the optimal ordering quantity and price. The analytical results
   demonstrate that the optimal ordering quantity and prices are obtained
   using closed-form formulas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This paper aims to investigate the uterotrophic activities of
   lactational exposure to combination of soy isoflavones (SIF) and
   bisphenol A (BPA) and to examine estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and
   estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) expressions in
   hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis and uterus. Methods Maternal rats that
   were breeding about 8 litters were randomly divided into four groups
   with seven dams in each group. Dams in different treatment groups
   received corn oil (control), 150 mg/kg BW of SIF, 150 mg/kg BW of BPA or
   combination of 150 mg/kg BW of SIF and 150 mg/kg BW of BPA,
   respectively, from postnatal day 5 to 11 (PND5-11) by gavage. On PND12
   and PND70, 10 female litters were killed and hypothalamus, pituitary,
   ovary and uterus were collected. ERa and ER beta expressions in these
   organs were detected with Western blotting assay. And vaginal opening
   time and estrus cycle were examined in animals fed for PND70. Results On
   PND12, the relative uterine weight of rats treated with ISF or BPA or
   their combination was significantly higher than that of untreated rats
   (P<0.05). But the relative uterine weight of rats in the co-exposure
   group was slightly lower than that in the group only exposed to SIF or
   BPA. On PND 70, however, the relative uterine weight in each treatment
   group was not statistically different from that in the control group
   (P>0.05). Vaginal opening time and estrus cycle in groups treated with
   SIF or BPA or their combination were similar to those in the control
   group (P>0.05). Exposure to SIF or BPA or their combination could
   up-regulate or down-regulate ER alpha and ER beta expressions in
   hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary and uterus on PND12 and PND70. These
   regulation patterns for ER alpha and ER beta were different in different
   organs at different time points. Conclusion Lactational exposure to ISF
   or BPA or their combination could induce uterotrophic responses in
   neonate rats, which disappeared in later life. But these data fail to
   suggest a possibility for synergic actions between SIF and BPA. It was
   also demonstrated that the uterotrophic effects of SIF and BPA exposure
   might, at least, involve modification of ER alpha or ER beta expressions
   in the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis.}},

Abstract = {{Open-door laminoplasty is a commonly performed procedure for the
   treatment of multiple level cervical spinal stenosis. One complication
   of this procedure is closure of the hinge and subsequent restenosis.
   Twinfix suture anchor was used in laminoplasty to stabilize cervical
   canal expansion. 53 patients with multiple level cervical spinal
   stenosis underwent laminoplasty. A unilateral open-door technique was
   performed for the lesion level and the elevated lamina was fixed to the
   lateral mass using Twinfix suture anchors. Radiography, magnetic
   resonance imaging, and computed tomography (CT) scanning were used for
   imaging studies. The Japanese Orthopedic Association score was adopted
   to compare clinical outcome before and after surgery. None of 53
   patients who had the door secured with Twinfix suture anchors had
   closure of the hinge. Additionally, the suture anchors maintained their
   position without loosening or ``pull-outs{''} on postoperative follow-up
   radiographs. The Japanese Orthopedic Association score increased
   significantly from 8.5 +/- A 3.2 before surgery to 14.2 +/- A 1.36 at
   final follow-up. Postoperative radiography and CT scan demonstrated
   significantly increased anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal.
   There were four short-term complications: two were small dural-tears
   which were repaired intraoperatively without further sequelae, and the
   other 2 were both epidural hematomas that required emergent return to
   the operating room for evacuation. There were no Twinfix suture
   anchor-related complications. This Twinfix suture anchor can provide a
   firm and secure anchor for elevated open laminae in laminoplasty.}},

Abstract = {{Zn1-xCdxO layers were deposited on the sapphire substrate using the
   radio-frequency magnetron co-sputtering system. The grown Zn1-xCdxO
   layers were carried out in the post-annealing treatment for 1 min at the
   800 degrees C oxygen-ambient by the rapid thermal annealing (RTA)
   method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment shows that the Zn1-xCdxO
   layers are changed from the single phase of the hexagonal structure at 0
   <= x <= 0.08 to the double phase of hexagonal-and-cubic structure at
   x=0.13. Thus, the maximum Cd-composition ratio with the hexagonal
   structure was found out to be x=0.08. Also, the crystallinity of
   Zn1-xCdxO layers at x=0.13 was remarkably improved by the RTA annealing
   treatment. This crystal quality improvement was thought to be associated
   with the relaxation of the compressive strain remaining in the Zn1-xCdxO
   layers. Therefore, the results of XRD and transmittance lead that the
   crystal quality of the Zn1-xCdxO layers forming the hexagonal ZnO phase
   is better than that forming the cubic CdO phase. Consequently, the
   reliable formation and the crystallinity of the Zn1-xCdxO layers were
   achieved by using the RTA method of short-time thermal-annealing at the
   high temperature. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Objective:
   Titanium oxide nanotube layers by anodization have excellent potential
   for dental implants because of good bone cell promotion. It is necessary
   to evaluate osteoblast behavior on different annealing temperature
   titania nanotubes for actual implant designs.
   Materials and methods:
   Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-Ray polycrystalline Diffractometer
   (XRD), X-ray photoelectron Spectroscope, and Atomic Force Microscopy
   (AFM) were used to characterize the different annealing temperature
   titania nanotubes. Confocal laser scanning microscopy, MTT, and Alizarin
   Red-S staining were used to evaluate the MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast behavior
   on different annealing temperature nanotubes.
   Results:
   The tubular morphology was constant when annealed at 450 degrees C and
   550 degrees C, but collapsed when annealed at 650 degrees C. XRD
   exhibited the crystal form of nanotubes after formation (amorphous),
   after annealing at 450 degrees C (anatase), and after annealing at 550
   degrees C (anatase/rutile). Annealing led to the complete loss of
   fluorine on nanotubes at 550 degrees C. Average surface roughness of
   different annealing temperature nanotubes showed no difference by AFM
   analysis. The proliferation and mineralization of preostoblasts cultured
   on anatase or anatase/rutile nanotube layers were shown to be
   significantly higher than smooth, amorphous nanotube layers.
   Conclusion:
   Annealing can change the crystal form and composition of nanotubes. The
   nanotubes after annealing can promote osteoblast proliferation and
   mineralization in vitro.}},

   than 0.2\% of the per capita annual disposal income in Beijing. This is

Abstract = {{This paper reports the development of a building energy demand
   predictive model based on the decision tree method. This method is able
   to classify and predict categorical variables: its competitive advantage
   over other widely used modeling techniques, such as regression method
   and ANN method, lies in the ability to generate accurate predictive
   models with interpretable flowchart-like tree structures that enable
   users to quickly extract useful information. To demonstrate its
   applicability, the method is applied to estimate residential building
   energy performance indexes by modeling building energy use intensity
   (EUI) levels. The results demonstrate that the use of decision tree
   method can classify and predict building energy demand levels accurately
   (93\% for training data and 92\% for test data), identify and rank
   significant factors of building EUI automatically. The method can
   provide the combination of significant factors as well as the threshold
   values that will lead to high building energy performance. Moreover, the
   average EUI value of data records in each classified data subsets can be
   used for reference when performing prediction. One crucial benefit is
   improving building energy performance and reducing energy consumption.
   Another advantage of this methodology is that it can be utilized by
   users without requiring much computation knowledge. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An all-silk composite, in which uniaxially-aligned and continuous-typed
   Bombyx mori silk fibers were embedded in a matrix of silk protein
   (fibroin), was successfully prepared via a solution casting process. The
   structure, morphology, mechanical and thermal properties of such silk
   fiber/fibroin composites were investigated with X-ray diffraction,
   scanning electron microscopy, tensile and compression tests, dynamic
   mechanical analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. The results
   demonstrated that the interface adhesion between silk fiber and the
   fibroin matrix was enhanced by controlling the fiber dissolution through
   6 mol L-1 LiBr aqueous solution. Compare to those of the pure fibroin
   counterparts, the overall mechanical properties as well as the thermal
   stability of such silk fiber/fibroin composites were significantly
   improved. For example, the composite with 25 wt\% fibers showed a
   breaking stress of 151 MPa and a breaking elongation of 27.1\% in the
   direction parallel to the fiber array, and a compression modulus of 1.1
   GPa in the perpendicular direction. The pure fibroin matrix (film), on
   the other hand, typically had a breaking stress of 60 MPa, a breaking
   elongation of 2.1\% and a compression modulus of 0.5 GPa, respectively.
   This work suggests that such a controllable technique may help in the
   preparation of animal silk based materials with promising properties for
   various applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Data Integration is becoming very important in many commercial
   applications and scientific research. A lot of algorithms and systems
   have been proposed and developed to address related issues from
   different aspects. Virtual database systems are well-recognized as one
   of the effective solutions of data integration. The existing execution
   modules in virtual database systems are very ineffective. MapReduce (MR)
   is a new computing model for parallel processing and has a good
   performance on large-scale data execution. In this paper, we propose a
   new distributed data integration system, called VDB-MR, which is based
   on the MapReduce technology, to efficiently integrate data from
   heterogeneous data sources. With VDB-MR, a unified view (i.e., a single
   virtual database) of multiple databases can be provided to users. We
   also conducted a series of experiments to evaluate VDB-MR by comparing
   it with an open source data integration system OGSA-DAI and two DBMSs in
   parallel. Experiment results show that VDB-MR significantly outperforms
   OGSA-DAI and the DBMSs in parallel. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Retrogression characteristics of a novel Al-Cu-Li-X alloy of 2A97 were
   studied by hardness testing, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The retrogression treatments of

   C were chosen by determining the peak temperature of delta`
   precipitation at 230 degrees C by DSC. The retrogression treatment at a
   lower temperature of 220 degrees C causes the precipitation and
   coarsening of delta` and theta` phases in the matrix, resulting in an
   increase in hardness. Retrogression at a higher temperature of 240
   degrees C causes the dissolution and coarsening of delta` and theta`
   precipitates in the matrix and on the grain boundaries, resulting in a
   decrease in hardness. Microstructural changes upon retrogression
   including the appearance of equilibrium precipitates such as T-1, T-2,

Abstract = {{This study compares the effects of hollow polymeric microspheres (PHMS)
   on specific mechanical properties and thermal properties of glass,
   basalt, and carbon woven fabric reinforced vinyl ester composites. The
   specific flexural and specific impact strengths of the composites were
   marginally increased with the addition of PHMS; however, it was at the
   expense of reduced specific flexural modulus. The thermal stability of
   the neat vinyl ester was improved with the addition of woven glass and
   carbon, but was consequently reduced with the further inclusion of PHMS.
   SEM observations identified the presence of the combined failure
   mechanism of fibers and PHMS. In short, the major reinforcing effect of
   the woven fiber-reinforced vinyl ester composites is governed by the
   type of fiber used, while the addition of PHMS enhanced the ductility of

   report and analyze data on airborne particles up to PM10, measured in
   the Brussels region from October 2002 to September 2003. Our
   investigation reveals detailed information regarding chemical
   composition of the airborne particles over the weekend period in the

Abstract = {{Multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) can support high
   data rates in next-generation multiuser wireless communication systems.
   Partial equalization (PE) is a low-complexity technique for combining
   the signals of subcarriers to improve the achievable performance of
   MC-CDMA systems in terms of their bit error probability (BEP) and bit
   error outage (BEO) in comparison with maximal ratio combining,
   orthogonality restoring combining, and equal-gain combining techniques.
   We analyze the performance of the multiuser MC-CDMA downlink and derive
   the optimal PE parameter expression, which minimizes the BEP. Realistic
   imperfect channel estimation and frequency-domain (FD) block-fading
   channels are considered. More explicitly, the analytical expression of
   the optimum PE parameter is derived as a function of the number of
   subcarriers, number of active users (i.e., the system load), mean
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and variance of the channel-estimation
   errors for the aforementioned FD block-fading channel. We show that the
   choice of the optimal PE technique significantly increases the
   achievable system load for the given target BEP and BEO.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The T-786C polymorphism of the gene for endothelial nitric
   oxide synthase (eNOS) and superoxide anion production may reduce
   production and bioavailability of nitric oxide, affecting the degree of
   vasodilation. This effect can be reversed by exercise.
   Objective: To investigate the influence of aerobic training and T-786C
   polymorphism in the concentrations of nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) in
   blood flow (BF) and blood pressure (BP).
   Methods: Thirty-two elderly pre-hypertensive women (59 +/- 6 years old)
   were divided into two groups according to the T-786C polymorphism (TT
   and TC + CC). We analyzed the concentrations of NOx (plasma) and blood
   flow by venous occlusion plethysmography at rest, 1, 2 and 3 minutes
   post-occlusion (BF-0 BF-1 BF-2 BF-3, respectively). Evaluations were
   performed before and after 6 months of a program of aerobic exercise.
   Results: In the pre-training evaluations, NOx levels were lower in TC +
   CC group than in TT group. The TT group showed correlations between NOx
   and BF-0 (r = 0.6) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and BF-0 (r =
   -0.7), but no correlation was found in TC + CC group. In the
   post-training evaluations, there were correlations between NOx and BF-0
   (r = 0.6) and the changes in NOx and DBP (r = -0.6) in TT group. There
   were also correlations between DBP and BF-1 (r = -0.8), DBP, and BF-2 (r
   = -0.6), DBP and BF-3 (r = -0.6), in the changes between NOx and BF-1 (r
   = 0.8) and changes in NOx and DBP (r = -0.7) in TC + CC group.
   Conclusion: It was concluded that 6 months of aerobic exercise can
   increase the relationship between NO, BP and BF in elderly of allele C
   carriers. (Arq Bras Cardiol 2010; 95(4): 510-517)}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{108}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Spontaneous atomic ordering takes place during metal-organic vapor phase
   epitaxy when certain semiconductors alloys start forming long-range
   arrangements different from their standard lattice unit cells. In the
   case of InGaP, a zincblende semiconductor, the ordered CuPt(B) structure
   consists of alternating Ga and In rich ((1) over bar 11) and (1 (1) over
   bar1) planes. In this investigation, InGaP was deposited on (001) Ge
   wafers with a 6 degrees miscut toward the {[}111] direction in two
   consecutive experiments. A surfactant was used in experiment A while
   depositing InGaP to induce a lower degree of order. high resolution
   x-ray diffraction was used to calculate composition and strain of the
   InGaP epilayers. The symmetric (004) as well as the asymmetric (224)
   glancing exit reflections were used. The results enabled the extraction
   of a theoretical band gap energy E-g corrected for strain effects.
   Photoluminescence was used to measure the actual E-g. By comparing the
   two, the degree of order eta was determined to be 0.12-0.15 for wafers
   from experiment A and 0.43-0.44 for wafers from experiment B. Atomic
   force microscopy AFM demonstrated that all experimental wafers had a
   surface rms roughness of 6.1-7.4 angstrom. Extensive nanoindentation
   measurements were performed on samples from both experiments. It was
   determined that the degree of order has no effect on the nanoindentation
   hardness of InGaP. Using 1/2 (115) superlattice reflection scans, the
   InGaP ordered domains size was estimated to be 28.5 nm for sample B1. No
   superlattice peak was detected in sample A1. The large ordered domain
   size in B1 explains why no order-hardening behavior was observed in
   InGaP. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:10.1063/1.3477322]}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1366-1375}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the previous theory for obtaining the quality factor of
   thermoelastic damping in microresonators has been modified. Here, the
   stretching term for the neutral axis of bending is considered, which has
   been neglected in previous work. The Taylor expansion of electric
   actuation has described the static position of microbeam, which is more
   accurate than previous work that extends it about the straight position
   of a microbeam. Also, the theory of this work may be used for two
   layered microresonators without this assumption that the length of two
   layered electrically actuated microresonators may be obtained, for the
   first time. To obtain this complete theory firstly the equations of
   motion coupled with thermal effects are obtained in a two layered
   microbeam where the second layer is deposited on a part of the first
   layer length. Then, the quality factor of thermoelastic damping of the
   system, i.e. the half of the ratio of the real part of the free
   vibration resonance frequency to its imaginary part, has been obtained
   by solving the free vibration equation using the strained parameter
   perturbation method. It has been shown that neglecting the stretching of
   neutral axis of bending and expanding the electrostatic actuation about
   the straight position of the microbeam considered in previous researches
   cause an error that is not negligible for the voltage larger than 30\%
   of the pull-in voltage. Also, it is shown that the quality factor of
   thermoelastic damping in two layered microresonators depends on the
   value of length, thickness and the kind of material of the deposited
   layer. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   drawbacks of the traditional prism based Kretschmann configuration, such
   as the utilization of polarized light or the necessity of a big and
   expensive coupling prism due to the optical fiber setup. In addition,
   the utilization of ITO coated optical fibers as the resonance supporting
   coating permits the tunability of the resonance wavelength and the
   sensitivity of the devices by adjusting the ITO coating thickness. More
   specifically, the sensitivity of these devices has been raised from 2121
   nm/Refractive index unit (RIU) of a device of 220 nm ITO coating
   thickness to 3658 nm/RIU and 3698 nm/RIU for devices of ITO coating
   thicknesses of 115 nm and 85 nm respectively.}},

   < 0,15 >, and those doped with Er. Pr and Ho ions have been prepared by
   direct synthesis and investigated by optical transmission and low
   temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy. It has been demonstrated by
   using (GeS2)(80)(Ga2S3)(20) glasses and by monitoring the intensity
   decrease of the broad band host glass luminescence that increasing Er
   doping leads to the partial removal of native defects generated by
   network disorder. Luminescence properties of Ge25Ga10S65:( Er, Pr, Ho)
   systems have further been studied by varying the excitation wavelengths.
   The base glass luminescence band has been found shifted from 1200 to
   1050 nm when excitation wavelength is decreased from 632.8 to, or below
   500 nm. The decreased excitation wavelength enables electron transfer
   over the band gap in Ge-Ga-S system and into higher metastable states of
   RE3+ ions. This is manifested by the shift of the base glass
   luminescence band to higher energy and by observation of new radiative
   4f-4f transitions. The efficiency of 4f-4f transitions in Ge-Se-Te:RE
   glasses is steadily decreasing with increasing Te content. A pronounced
   re-absorption of the host glass luminescence is observed in telluride
   glasses doped with Pr and Er. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Gliclazide (GL, C15H21N3O3S) drug is used as non-insulin-dependant
   diabetes mellitus. The drug was investigated using thermal analysis (TA)
   measurements (TG/DTG) and electron impact mass spectral (EI-MS)
   fragmentation at 70 eV techniques. The mass spectra of GL at different
   values of ion source temperatures (400, 416, 425, and 440 K) are
   recorded and investigated. Semiempirical MO calculation, using PM3
   procedure, has been carried out on neutral molecule and positively
   charged species. These calculations included bond length, bond order,
   bond strain, partial charge distribution, ionization energy, and heats
   of formation (Delta H (f)). PM3 procedure provides a basis for fine
   distinction among sites of initial bond cleavage, which is crucial to
   the rationalization of subsequent fragmentation of the molecule. The
   primary fragmentation pathway in both TA and MS (at different values of
   ion source temperature) is initiated by S-N bond rupture. TA and DTG
   show one main weight loss at 250.38 A degrees C and four peaks at 271.6,
   360.99, 427.93 and 479.17 A degrees C in DTA, which may be attributed to
   various fragments. Also, the rate constant (K') of thermal degradation
   has been tested isothermally at 210 and 600 A degrees C. The calculated
   rate values are 9.6 x 10(-3) and 0.33 x 10(-3) s(-1), respectively, and
   discussed. In MS, the effect of ion source temperature on mass spectral
   fragmentation processes is discussed on the basis of energy
   considerations using quasi equilibrium theory.}},

Abstract = {{The recurrence rate in conservative surgical treatment, without
   adjunctive treatment, of the keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) has
   been studied. A total number of 68 patients, previously untreated and
   fulfilling the histopathological criteria provided by the 2005 WHO
   classification, has been retrospectively reviewed. The study period
   lasted from 1975 to 2009. Treatment consisted of enucleation (n = 58) or
   marsupialization ( n = 10). The mean follow-up period was 65 months. No
   involved or adjacent teeth were removed, except for wisdom teeth, if
   applicable, and badly decayed teeth.
   After enucleation, the recurrence rate was 20.7\% in a mean follow-up
   period of 46 months, while 40\% of the marsupialized KCOTs recurred in a
   mean follow-up period of 58 months. In none of the patients permanent
   loss of nerve function has been observed. Due to the recurrence rate
   observed in the present study, and in view of the potential benefit of
   adjunctive treatment in KCOT, particularly with regard to the use of
   Carnoy's solution, there is a need for prospective studies to test its
   usefulness with regard to the risk of recurrences. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   First published July 16, 2010;
   doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00763.2009.-TNF-alpha is a proinflammatory cytokine
   and is an important mediator of maternal endothelial dysfunction leading
   to preeclampsia. In this study, we tested whether IL-10 protects against
   TNF-alpha-induced endothelial dysfunction in murine aorta. In in vitro
   experiments, aortic rings of C57BL/6 female mice were incubated in
   Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of either vehicle
   (distilled H2O), TNF-alpha (4 nmol/l), or recombinant mouse IL-10 (300
   ng/ml) or in the presence of both TNF-alpha and IL-10 for 22 h at 37
   degrees C. In in vivo experiments C57BL6/IL-10 knockout female mice were
   treated with saline or TNF-alpha (220 ng.kg-1.day(-1)) for 14 days.
   Aortic rings were isolated from in vitro and in vivo experiments and
   mounted in a wire myograph (Danish Myotech) and stretched to a tension
   of 5 mN. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was assessed by constructing
   cumulative concentration-response curves to acetylcholine (ACh, 0.001-10
   mu mol/l) during phenylephrine (10 mu mol/l)-induced contraction. As a
   result, overnight exposure of aortic rings to TNF-alpha resulted in
   significant blunted maximal relaxing responses (E-max) to ACh compared
   with untreated rings (22 +/- 4 vs. 82 +/- 3\%, respectively). IL-10
   knockout mice treated with TNF-alpha showed significant impairment in
   ACh responses (E-max) compared with C57BL/6 mice treated with TNF-alpha
   (51 +/- 3 vs. 72 +/- 3\%, respectively). Western blot analysis showed
   that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was reduced by
   TNF-alpha in in vitro and in vivo experiments, whereas IL-10 restored
   the eNOS expression. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10
   prevents impairment in endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation caused by
   TNF-alpha by protecting eNOS expression.}},

Abstract = {{Poetry, alcohol, nature and music are the common life interests of the
   ``Seven Virtuous of Bamboo{''}, and these interests most definitely form
   their personal temperaments. This paper focuses solely on the music
   theory of Ruan Ji and Ji Kang, who are the most representative figures
   among the seven men, since historical documents which remain concerning
   the other five are insufficient. In his Youth, Ruan Ji was an admirer of
   Yan Hui and Min Zhi Qian and studied Confucianism, a philosophy which
   emphasized both self-cultivation to gain sagehood and the embracement of
   worldly affaires to achieve merit. During this period, he had finished
   the two texts Tong Yi Lun and Yue Lun. Ji Kang was versatile and
   remarkably expert at ancient stringed instruments, and had written a
   book on string music which was highly appraised by succeeding
   generations. Ruan Ji and Ji Kang were close friends and were key figures
   in the ``Seven Virtuous of Bamboo{''}. In terms of music theory, they
   both attributed aesthetic criterion to the substantial characteristic of
   the Dao, which is the root of heaven and earth, as well as the root of
   changes in worldly things. However, Ruan Ji and Ji Kang still differed
   in their views on music. Ruan Ji laid more stress on the educational
   function of music in terms of ethics, which serves as the means of
   cultivating man's heart and transforming social traditions. On the
   contrary, Ji Kang's music theory, corresponding to his belief in
   ``surpassing Confucian standards and following nature{''} in the text
   Shi Si Lun, placed a greater emphasis on the autonomy of music so that
   music frees itself from its educational function. Consequently, Ji Kang
   formed his aesthetic vision of the union between man and the Dao, in the
   status of which the Perfect man achieves Perfect happiness. By
   contrasting the music theory of Ruan Ji with that of Ji Kang, this paper
   will introduce their respective performances and talent, and as well
   analyze their diverse ideas on musical concepts, functions and values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel service-oriented network architecture to
   bridge the informational gap between user applications and optical
   networks providing technology-agnostic multigranular optical network
   services for clouds. A mediation layer (service plane) between user
   applications and network control is proposed to facilitate a mapping
   process between user application requests and the network services. At
   the network level, a multigranular optical network (MGON) is proposed
   and implemented to support dynamic wavelength and subwavelength
   granularities with different transport formats {[}optical burst switched
   (OBS), optical burst transport (OBT)], reservation protocols (one-way,
   two-way), and different quality-of-service (QoS) levels per service
   type. The service-oriented multigranular optical network has been
   designed, implemented, and demonstrated on an experimental testbed. The
   testbed consists of service and network resource provisioning, service
   abstraction, and network resource virtualization. The service-to-network
   interoperation is provided by means of a gateway that maps service
   requests to technology-specific parameters and a common signaling
   channel for both service and network resource provisioning.}},

Title = {{Functional Interchangeability of Late Domains, Late Domain Cofactors and
   Ubiquitin in Viral Budding}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The membrane scission event that separates nascent enveloped virions
   from host cell membranes often requires the ESCRT pathway, which can be
   engaged through the action of peptide motifs, termed late (L-) domains,
   in viral proteins. Viral PTAP and YPDL-like L-domains bind directly to
   the ESCRT-I and ALIX components of the ESCRT pathway, while PPxY motifs
   bind Nedd4-like, HECT-domain containing, ubiquitin ligases (e. g. WWP1).
   It has been unclear precisely how ubiquitin ligase recruitment
   ultimately leads to particle release. Here, using a lysine-free viral
   Gag protein derived from the prototypic foamy virus (PFV), where
   attachment of ubiquitin to Gag can be controlled, we show that several
   different HECT domains can replace the WWP1 HECT domain in chimeric
   ubiquitin ligases and drive budding. Moreover, artificial recruitment of
   isolated HECT domains to Gag is sufficient to stimulate budding.
   Conversely, the HECT domain becomes dispensable if the other domains of
   WWP1 are directly fused to an ESCRT-1 protein. In each case where
   budding is driven by a HECT domain, its catalytic activity is essential,
   but Gag ubiquitination is dispensable, suggesting that ubiquitin
   ligation to trans-acting proteins drives budding. Paradoxically,
   however, we also demonstrate that direct fusion of a ubiquitin moiety to
   the C-terminus of PFV Gag can also promote budding, suggesting that
   ubiquitination of Gag can substitute for ubiquitination of trans-acting
   proteins. Depletion of Tsg101 and ALIX inhibits budding that is
   dependent on ubiquitin that is fused to Gag, or ligated to trans-acting
   proteins through the action of a PPxY motif. These studies underscore
   the flexibility in the ways that the ESCRT pathway can be engaged, and
   suggest a model in which the identity of the protein to which ubiquitin
   is attached is not critical for subsequent recruitment of
   ubiquitin-binding components of the ESCRT pathway and viral budding to
   proceed.}},

Abstract = {{A delayed Lotka-Volterra two-species predator-prey system with discrete
   hunting delay and distributed maturation delay for the predator
   population described by an integral with a strong delay kernel is
   considered. By linearizing the system at the positive equilibrium and
   analyzing the associated characteristic equation, the asymptotic
   stability of the positive equilibrium is investigated and Hopf
   bifurcations are demonstrated. It is found that under suitable
   conditions on the parameters the positive equilibrium is asymptotically
   stable when the hunting delay is less than a certain critical value and
   unstable when the hunting delay is greater than this critical value.
   Meanwhile, according to the Hopf bifurcation theorem for functional
   differential equations (FDEs), we find that the system can also undergo
   a Hopf bifurcation of nonconstant periodic solution at the positive
   equilibrium when the hunting delay crosses through a sequence of
   critical values. In particular, by applying the normal form theory and
   the center manifold reduction for FDEs, an explicit algorithm
   determining the direction of Hopf bifurcations and the stability of
   bifurcating periodic solutions occurring through Hopf bifurcations is
   given. Finally, to verify our theoretical predictions, some numerical
   simulations are also included at the end of this paper. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{An approximate theoretical expression for the current induced by long
   internal solitary waves is presented when the ocean is continuously or
   two-layer stratified. Particular attention is paid to characterizing
   velocity fields in terms of magnitude, flow components, and their
   temporal evolution/spatial distribution. For the two-layer case, the
   effects of the upper/lower layer depths and the relative layer density
   difference upon the induced current are further studied. The results
   show that the horizontal components are basically uniform in each layer
   with a shear at the interface. In contrast, the vertical counterparts
   vary monotonically in the direction of the water depth in each layer
   while they change sign across the interface or when the wave peak passes
   through. In addition, though the vertical components are generally one
   order of magnitude smaller than the horizontal ones, they can never be
   neglected in predicting the heave response of floating platforms in
   gravitationally neutral balance. Comparisons are made between the
   partial theoretical results and the observational field data. Future
   research directions regarding the internal wave induced flow field are
   also indicated.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral imager has more spectral channels and higher spectral
   resolution compared to normal spectral instrument. Stray light is one of
   the important reasons affecting the spectral accuracy of the
   hyperspectral imager, but the current stray light measurements can't
   meet the need. Definition, sources and harmfulness of stray light are
   described in the present paper. The feasibility and superiority of the
   stray light factor 41, used to describe the stray light characteristics
   of the spectral instruments, is investigated thoroughly, where the
   definition, physical significance and value of engineering application
   of stray light interference factor f(i)(lambda) and stray light
   disturbance factor F-i(lambda) are given. Finally, the system
   components, measurement procedure and measurement results of the stray
   light measurement system, using narrow-band filter, are introduced.
   Results show that the stray light factor 41 meets the need of the stray
   light measurement because it can indicate the stray light
   characteristics of the spectral instruments without relationship to the
   light source, filter, detector and other measurement conditions, and the
   measurement efficiency is increased at least one-fold than the spectral
   stray light factors method.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid, sensitive and specific semi-nested RT-PCR was developed to
   detect and differentiate virulent and avirulent strains of Newcastle

   from the semi-nested RT-PCR were consistent with those from nucleotide
   sequence analysis, plaque forming assays, mean death time (MDT)
   measurements and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI). Furthermore,
   13 class I NDV strains can be characterized by the semi-nested RT-PCR
   approach, which was feasible by the conventional methods. The detection
   limit for the semi-nested RT-PCR was two plaque forming units (PFU) both
   for NDV strain F48E9 in allantoic fluid and for isolate
   APMV1/ch/ChinaND4031 in oral or cloacal swabs. In conclusion, this
   semi-nested RT-PCR method offers a new assay for the rapid detection and

   propulsion of the nanowire. The motion of the nanowire can be precisely
   controlled using a uniform rotating magnetic field. We investigate the
   propulsion mechanism and the trajectory of the nanowire during the
   tumbling motion and demonstrate cargo transport of a polystyrene
   microbead by the nanowire over a flat surface or across an open
   microchannel. The results imply that functionalized, ferromagnetic
   one-dimensional, tumbling nanostructures can be used for cell
   manipulation and targeted drug delivery in a low Reynolds number aqueous

Abstract = {{TXNDC5 (thioredoxin domain containing 5) is over-expressed in tumors of
   the cervix, uterus, stomach and lung. However, not much is known about
   the functional roles of TXNDC5 gene in gastric adenocarcinoma. In the
   present study, we intend to investigate the effects of TXNDC5 on the
   growth, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and cell cycle of the gastric
   cancer cell line MKN45 and normal gastric cell line HFE145.
   TXNDC5 cDNA was inserted into a constitutive vector pcDNA3.1 followed by
   transfection into normal gastric cell line HFE145 using liposome. Then,
   stable transfectants were selected and appraised. Specific silencing of
   TXNDC5 gene was achieved using a vector-based short interference RNAs
   (siRNA) system in gastric cancer cell line MKN45. The growth and
   proliferation were analyzed by cell growth curves and colony-forming
   assay, respectively. The apoptosis and cell cycles of these clones were
   analyzed using flow cytometry. The invasion of these cells was analyzed
   by cell migration assay. The TXNDC5 stable expression cell lines
   (HFE-TXNDC5) and TXNDC5 RNAi cell lines (MKN-SR1,2) were detected and
   compared with their control groups, respectively.
   HFE-TXNDC5 grew faster than HFE145 and HFE-PC(HFE145 transfected with
   pcDNA3.1 vector). MKN-SR1 grew slower than MKN45 and MKN-SS1,2 (MKN45
   transfected with scrambled control duplexes). The cell counts of
   HFE-TXNDC5 in the fifth, sixth and seventh days were significantly
   higher than those of control groups (P < 0.05). The cell counts of
   MKN-SR1 in the fifth, sixth and seventh days were significantly lower
   than those of control groups (P < 0.05). Cell cycle analysis showed that
   there were significant differences in proportions of G0-G1 and G2-M
   phase between HFE-TXNDC5, MKN-SR1 cells and their control groups,
   respectively (P < 0.05). The apoptosis rate of HFE-TXNDC5 was
   significantly lower than that of control groups (P < 0.05). The results
   of colony-forming assay showed that the colony formation rate of
   HFE-TXNDC5 was higher than those of control groups, otherwise the rate
   of MKN-SR1 were lower than those of their control groups (P < 0.05). The
   results of cell migration assay showed that the migration rate of
   HFE-TXNDC5 were significantly higher than that of its control group.
   Conversely, the migration rate of MKN-SR1 was significantly lower than
   that of its control group (P < 0.05).
   TXNDC5 can promote the growth and proliferation of gastric cells.
   Silencing of TXNDC5 can restrain the growth and proliferation of gastric
   cancer cells. The gene can enhance the capability of invasion of gastric
   cancer cells. In some respects, TXNDC5 could be thought as a
   tumor-enhancing gene in gastric cancer.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient TiO2 photocatalyst was obtained by surface hybridization
   with a thin layer of C-60 molecules. The photocatalytic performance of
   C-60-hybridized TiO2 under ultraviolet light irradiation was enhanced by
   4 times compared with that of P25-TiO2 photocatalyst. The enhanced
   photocatalytic activity for C-60-hybridized TiO2 was originated from the
   high migration efficiency of photo-induced electrons on the interface of
   C-60 and TiO2, which was produced by the interaction TiO2 and C-60 with
   a conjugative pi-system. The interaction was confirmed by the Raman
   spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and photo-electrochemical
   measurements. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity strongly
   depended on the coverage of C-60 molecules on the surface of TiO2, and
   the optimum hybridization effect was found at a weight ratio of 2.5 wt\%
   (C-60/TiO2). The mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of
   TiO2 by C-60 was discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introducing diffusion bonding of laminated thin metal plates to the
   fabrication of slotted waveguide arrays enlightens the high potential
   and the feasibility of multi-layer antennas with high-performance. It is
   a promising process with low cost even for a double-layer antenna,
   because the number of etching patterns for thin metal plates is only
   five. In this paper, a double-layer antenna for broadband
   characteristics is designed in 39 GHz band as demonstration. A 20 x
   20-element antenna is composed of 2 x 2 sub-arrays by installing a
   partially-corporate feed circuit in the bottom layer underneath
   radiating waveguides in the top layer. The five-element sub-arrays in
   both the feeding and radiating parts are designed first. A new structure
   for the last slot coupler with shortened termination is also proposed to
   avoid an extra slot-free region when assembling the neighbor sub-arrays.
   As the simulation results by HFSS, the maximum gain of 34.55 dBi with
   the antenna efficiency of 85.5\% is estimated at 38.5 GHz. The test
   antenna is fabricated by the diffusion bonding of thin copper plates. As
   the measurement results, a very high aperture efficiency of 83.2\% with
   the directivity of 34.5 dBi is realized at the center frequency of 38.75
   GHz, where the antenna gain of 34.4 dBi with the high antenna efficiency
   of 81.4\% is achieved. The bandwidth of 5.0\% defined as I dB down from
   the maximum gain is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Double perovskite compounds (Sr2-xEux)FeMoO6 (0 <= x <= 0.3) were
   prepared by solid-state reaction at high temperature. Crystal structure,
   magnetic and transport properties of the compounds were investigated.
   The crystal structure of the compounds changes from an 14/m lattice to
   an Fm (3) over barm lattice around x=0.1. The unit-cell volume decreases
   with the doping level in both the 14/m lattice and the Fm (3) over barm
   lattice. The resistivity of the compounds shows a metal semiconductor
   transition, and the transition temperature TM-S increases with the
   doping level. However, Curie temperature (T-C) of the compounds exhibits
   a weak dependence on the doping level. The saturation magnetization
   (M-5) at 100 K varies almost linearly with the anti-site defect
   concentration and agrees well with the simple FIM model. In contrast to
   the Ce-, Pr-, Nd- and Sm-doped Sr2FeMoO6, the difference of M-S of
   (Sr2-xEu)FeMoO6 between 5 and 100 K indicates that the moment of Eu3+ is
   antiparellel to that of Fe3+ at low temperature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{On Active Learning and Supervised Transmission of Spectrum Sharing Based
   Cognitive Radios by Exploiting Hidden Primary Radio Feedback}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the wireless spectrum sharing between a pair of
   distributed primary radio (PR) and cognitive radio (CR) links. Assuming
   that the PR link adapts its transmit power and/or rate upon receiving an
   interference signal from the CR and such transmit adaptations are
   observable by the CR, this results in a new form of feedback from the PR
   to CR, refereed to as hidden PR feedback, whereby the CR learns the PR's
   strategy for transmit adaptations without the need of a dedicated
   feedback channel from the PR. In this paper, we exploit the hidden PR
   feedback to design new learning and transmission schemes for spectrum
   sharing based CRs, namely active learning and supervised transmission.
   For active learning, the CR initiatively sends a probing signal to
   interfere with the PR, and from the observed PR transmit adaptations the
   CR estimates the channel gain from its transmitter to the PR receiver,
   which is essential for the CR to control its interference to the PR
   during the subsequent data transmission. This paper proposes a new
   transmission protocol for the CR to implement the active learning and
   the solutions to deal with various practical issues for implementation,
   such as time synchronization, rate estimation granularity, power
   measurement noise, and channel variation. Furthermore, with the acquired
   knowledge from active learning, the CR designs a supervised data
   transmission by effectively controlling the interference powers both to
   and from the PR, so as to achieve the optimum performance tradeoffs for
   the PR and CR links. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the proposed schemes for CRs under different system
   setups.}},

Abstract = {{A chromosome with two functional centromeres is cytologically unstable
   and can only be stabilized when one of the two centromeres becomes
   inactivated via poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we report a
   transmissible chromosome with multiple centromeres in wheat. This
   chromosome encompassed one large and two small domains containing the
   centromeric histone CENH3. The two small centromeres are in a close
   vicinity and often fused as a single centromere on metaphase
   chromosomes. This fused centromere contained approximately 30\% of the
   CENH3 compared to the large centromere. An intact tricentric chromosome
   was transmitted to about 70\% of the progenies, which was likely a
   consequence of the dominating pulling capacity of the large centromere
   during anaphases of meiosis. The tricentric chromosome showed
   characteristics typical to dicentric chromosomes, including chromosome
   breaks and centromere inactivation. Remarkably, inactivation was always
   associated with the small centromeres, indicating that small centromeres
   are less likely to survive than large ones in dicentric chromosomes. The
   inactivation of the small centromeres also coincided with changes of
   specific histone modifications, including H3K27me2 and H3K27me3, of the
   pericentromeric chromatin.}},

Abstract = {{Maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) transforms have proven

   use the parameters of MLLR transforms as features for SVM modeling and

   transforms using maximum likelihood criterion, we propose to use Maximum
   a posteriori linear regression (MAPLR) for feature extraction This work
   is enriched by a multi-class technique, which clusters the Gaussian
   mixtures into regression classes and estimates a different transform for
   each class The transforms of all classes are concatenated into a
   supervector for SVM classification Besides, a further accuracy boost is
   obtained by combining supervectors derived from both female and male
   UBMs into a larger supervector Experiments on a NIST 2008 SRE corpus
   show that the MAPLR system outperforms MLLR and the multi-class
   approaches can also bring significant gains}},

Abstract = {{Tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used to
   quantitatively analyze the status of the white matter anatomy in a
   tract-specific manner in many types of diseases. This approach, however,
   involves subjective judgment in the tract-editing process to extract
   only the tracts of interest. This process, usually performed by manual
   delineation of regions of interest, is also time-consuming, and certain
   tracts, especially the short cortico-cortical association fibers, are
   difficult to reconstruct. In this paper, we propose an automated
   approach for reconstruction of a large number of white matter tracts. In
   this approach, existing anatomical knowledge about tract trajectories
   (called the Template ROI Set or TRS) were stored in our DTI-based brain
   atlas with 130 three-dimensional anatomical segmentations, which were
   warped non-linearly to individual DTI data. We examined the degree of
   matching with manual results for selected fibers. We established 30 TRSs
   to reconstruct 30 prominent and previously well-described fibers. In
   addition, TRSs were developed to delineate 29 short association fibers
   that were found in all normal subjects examined in this paper (N = 20).
   Probabilistic maps of the 59 tract trajectories were created from the
   normal subjects and were incorporated into our image analysis tool for
   automated tract-specific quantification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

   base-line separated within 17 min using a borate phosphate running
   buffer (1.5 x 10(-2) mol/L borate-3 x 10(-2) mol/L phosphate running
   buffer, pH 9.0) at a working potential of +0.90 V (vs. SCE) and a
   separation voltage of 19 kV. The linear relationship between
   concentration and current response was obtained with detection limits
   (S/N = 3) ranging from 1.0 x 10(-7) to 2.1 x 10(-7) g/mL for all
   analytes. This proposed method was successfully used in the analysis of
   four kinds of chrysanthemum with relatively simple extraction
   procedures, the assay results were satisfactory. (C) 2010 Yu Zhi Fang.

Abstract = {{The authors propose that power distance belief (PDB) (i.e., accepting
   and expecting power disparity) influences impulsive buying beyond other
   related cultural dimensions, such as individualism collectivism. This
   research supports an associative account that links PDB and impulsive
   buying as a manifestation of self-control, such that those with high PDB
   display less impulsive buying. Furthermore, this effect manifests for
   vice products but not for virtue products. The authors also find that
   restraint from temptations can occur automatically for people who have
   repeated practice (i.e., chronically high PDBs). Taken together, these
   results imply that products should be differentially positioned as vice
   or virtue products in accordance with consumers' PDBs.}},

Abstract = {{In order to treat produced water from polymer flooding (PWPF), a new
   treatment method of combining hydrolysis acidification-dynamic membrane
   bioreactor (DMBR)-coagulation process was developed. The experimental
   results demonstrated that the highest acidification efficiency in
   hydrolysis acidification reactor (HAR) was 10.98\% under hydraulic
   retention time (HRT) of 12 h. During the stable stage of dynamic
   membrane, the average concentration of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) in effluent from DMBR was 1.50 and 476.63
   mg/L, respectively, while the concentration of oil was too low to be
   detected. In coagulation process, when the effluent from DMBR at pH 9.0
   was treated directly, the COD removal efficiency could reach 89.41\%
   with Aluminum sulfate (Al-2(SO4)(3)) under the dosage of 140 mg/L
   However, the dosage of Al-2(SO4)(3) would decrease to 80 mg/L with the
   same COD removal efficiency (88.37\%) under the optimal pH 5.0. The
   combined process operated continuously for 30 days and the final
   effluent could meet the class I National Wastewater Discharge Standard
   of China. (GB 8978-1996). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional electrospun nanofibers of p-type NiO/n-type ZnO
   heterojunctions with different molar ratios of Ni to Zn were
   successfully synthesized using a facile electrospinning technique. X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive
   X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance (DR)
   spectroscopy, resonant Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL)
   spectroscopy, and surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) were used to
   characterize the as-synthesized nanofters. The results indicated that
   the p-n heterojunctions formed between the cubic structure NiO and
   hexangular structure ZnO in the NiO/ZnO nanofibers. Furthermore, the
   photocatalytic activity of the as-electrospun NiO/ZnO nanofibers for the
   degradation of rhodamine B (RB) was much higher than that of electrospun
   NiO and ZnO nanofibers, which could be ascribed to the formation of p-n
   heterojunctions in the NiO/ZnO nanohbers. In particular, the p-type
   NiO/n-type ZnO heterojunccion nanohbers with the original Ni/Zn molar
   ratio of I exhibited the best catalytic activity, which might be
   attributed to their high separation efficiency of photogenerated
   electrons and holes. Notably, the electrospun nanofibers of p-type
   NiO/n-type ZnO heterojunctions could be easily recycled without a
   decrease of the photocatalytic activity due to their one-dimensional
   nanostructural property.}},

Abstract = {{To realize the benefits of SiC power electronics and optical-driving
   device technology, we present optically activated SiC power transistors
   for pulsed-power application. Although limited by the indirect bandgap
   of SiC, the transistor employs a bipolar structure with an internal
   current gain, which amplifies the photogenerated current and therefore
   has the capability to reduce the optical-triggering power requirement.
   The transistors are fabricated on an n-type 4H-SiC substrate with
   switch-on triggered by a short UV (337.1 nm) laser pulse with 0.5-mJ
   optical energy. The transistor successfully switches 1200 V with an FWHM
   of about 180 ns, a rise time of less than 20 ns, and a fall time of
   about 200 ns. This initial work forms the basis for the further
   development of high-speed and energy-efficient SiC-based optically
   controlled power switches for high-temperature and high-power

Abstract = {{Velvet antler is believed to have body strengthening, immunomodulatory
   and anti-aging effects. It is used in Chinese commercial functional
   foods and nutraceuticals. The antioxidant activity of the aqueous
   extract of velvet antler (AEVA) from Germs elaphus Linnaeus was
   evaluated with DPPH-radical scavenging, FRAP, Fe(2+) -chelating and
   inhibition of linoleic acid autoxidation assays. AEVA showed antioxidant
   activity in all four assays. After removal of protein from AEVA, the
   antioxidant activity was significantly elevated. A semi-preparative HPLC
   equipped with a C(18) column was used for further separation of the
   non-protein components (AEVA-S). Identification of the most active
   fraction (AEVA-SII) of AEVA-S was accomplished by LC/MS, HPLC and UV/Vis
   analyses. The HPLC chromatogram showed five main peaks identified as
   nucleotides (3'-CMP, 2'-CMP, 3'-UMP and 2'-UMP) and hypoxanthine.
   Nucleotides in AEVA-SII exhibited no free-radical scavenging and
   ferric-reducing activity. Only UMP exhibited Fe(2+)-chelating activity
   which accounted for 34.75\% of the total Fe(2+) -chelating activity of
   AEVA-SII. The results indicated that other unidentified components with
   antioxidant activity were present in AEVA-SII.}},

Abstract = {{We have shown that heat stress or a superoxide dismutase mimic
   nitroxide, Tempo, induces apoptosis, while their combination causes
   nonapoptotic cell death; however, the underlying mechanism for this
   switch remains unclear. Here we identified for the first time that 10 mM
   Tempo present during heating at 44A degrees C for 30 min rapidly induced
   autophagy in U937 leukemic cells in spite of Bax activation and
   mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) permeabilization. This co-treatment
   inhibited the processing of heat-activated procaspases-2, -8, -9 and -3
   into active small subunits, leading to the inhibition of
   caspase-dependent apoptosis, and instead caused the induction of
   autophagy. The inactivation of caspases, a key event, could result from
   oxidation of active-site-CysSH of all caspases by a prooxidant
   oxo-ammonium cation, an intermediate derived Tempo during dismutation of
   heat-induced superoxide anion. In addition, the co-treatment caused
   mitochondrial calcium overloads, the mitochondrial inner membrane
   permeabilization, profound mitochondrial dysfunction, and liberation of
   Beclin 1 from the Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complex, all of which contributed to
   induction of autophagy. These autophagic cells underwent propidium
   iodide-positive necrosis in a delayed fashion, leading to the complete
   proliferative inhibition. Remarkably, ruthenium red and BAPTA, which
   interfere with mitochondrial calcium uptake, facilitated autophagic
   necrotic death. Cyclosporin A, which binds to cyclophilin D, had a
   similar necrotic effect. 3-Methyladenine facilitated the necrosis of
   autophagic cells. In contrast, 5 mM Tempo-44A degrees C/10 min or 44A
   degrees C/30 min induced Bax-mediated MOM permeabilization and
   caspase-dependent apoptosis more potently than Tempo alone. Thus, Tempo
   is a unique thermosensitizer to synergistically induce apoptosis and
   autophagic cell death.}},

Abstract = {{Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) cover up to 60-70\% of the soil
   surface in grasslands rehabilitated during the ``Grain for Green{''}
   project implemented in the hilly Loess Plateau region in 1999. As
   biocrusts fix nitrogen (N), they are an important part of restoring soil
   fertility. We measured nitrogenase activity (NA) in biocrusts from sites
   rehabilitated at six different time periods to estimate 1) the effects
   of moisture content and temperature on NA in biocrusts of different ages
   and 2) the potential N contribution from biocrusts to soils and plants
   in this region. Results show that NA in the biocrusts was mostly
   controlled by the species composition, as the activity of biocrusts
   dominated by free-living soil cyanobacteria was significantly higher
   than that of moss-dominated biocrusts. Nitrogenase activity was also
   influenced by soil moisture content and ambient temperature, with a
   significant decline in activity when moisture levels were decreased to
   20\% field water-holding capacity. The optimal temperature for NA was
   35-40 degrees C and 30-40 degrees C for cyanobacteria- and
   moss-dominated biocrusts, respectively. Biocrust fixed N is likely an
   important source of N in this ecosystem, as we estimated annual
   potential N inputs per hectare in these grasslands to be up to 13 kg N
   ha(-1) and 4 kg N ha(-1) for cyanobacteria- and moss-dominated

Abstract = {{Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a bioactive peptide of the renin-angiotensin
   system, acting not only as a vasoconstrictor but also as a growth
   promoter via angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) in some cancer. In
   this study, we examined the mechanisms by which Ang II affected the cell
   proliferation in AT1R-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Ang II
   stimulated the growth of breast cancer cells in a dose- and
   time-dependent manner. The maximal proliferation effect on MCF-7 cells
   was obtained with 10(-4) M Ang II at 24 h. Losartan (10(-5) M, an AT1R
   antagonist) significantly decreased the level of Ang-II-induced
   proliferative effects, whereas PD123319 (10(-5) M, an AT2R antagonist)
   had no effects. Moreover, Ang II could significantly accelerate S-phase
   progression, which was inhibited by losartan (10(-5) M) or LY294002 (50
   mu M, a PI3-kinase inhibitor). In addition, Ang II caused rapid
   activation of p-Akt in a dose- and time-dependent manner. 10(-4) M Ang
   II induced a significant increase of p-Akt in 15 min. The peak level of
   p-Akt could be persisted for at least 6 h. Among the signaling molecules
   downstream of Akt, we revealed that Ang II also significantly
   upregulated CyclinDI, GSK3 beta, and downregulated p27. Pretreatment
   with losartan (10(-5) M) or LY294002 (50 mu M) could significantly
   suppress these effects of Ang II. These findings suggest that Ang II
   plays a role in the growth of AT1R-positive breast cancer cells through
   PI3-kinase/Akt pathway activation. Therefore, targeting Ang II/AT1R
   signaling could be a novel therapeutic for breast cancer. J. Cell.

Abstract = {{Treatment of highly concentrated organic wastewater is characterized as
   cost-consuming. The conventional technology uses the
   anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process (A(2)/O), which does not produce hydrogen.
   There is potential for energy saving using hydrogen utilization
   associated with wastewater treatment because hydrogen can be produced
   from organic wastewater using anaerobic fermentation. A 50m(3) pilot
   bio-reactor for hydrogen production was constructed in Shandong
   Province, China in 2006 but to date the hydrogen produced has not been
   utilized. In this work, a technical-economic model based on hydrogen
   utilization is presented and analyzed to estimate the potential
   improvement to a citric wastewater plant. The model assesses the size,
   capital cost, annual cost, system efficiency and electricity cost under
   different configurations. In a stand-alone situation, the power
   production from hydrogen is not sufficient for the required load, thus a
   photovoltaic array (PV) is employed as the power supply. The simulated
   results show that the combination of solar and bio-hydrogen has a much
   higher cost compared with the A(2)/O process. When the grid is
   connected, the system cost achieved is 0.238 US\$ t(-1) wastewater,
   which is lower than 0.257 US\$ t(-1) by the A(2)/O process. The results
   reveal that a simulated improvement by using bio-hydrogen and a FC
   system is effective and feasible for the citric wastewater plant, even
   when compared to the current cost of the A(2)/O process. In addition,
   lead acid and vanadium flow batteries were compared for energy storage
   service. The results show that a vanadium battery has lower cost and
   higher efficiency due to its long lifespan and energy efficiency.
   Additionally, the cost distribution of components shows that the PV
   dominates the cost in the stand-alone situation, while the bio-reactor
   is the main cost component in the parallel grid. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A theoretical study on the spatial configurations of the catalytic
   dehydrogenation of the pre- and post- Ti-doped NaAlH4 (001)2 x 2 x 1
   supercell surface crystals was performed by using the Car-Parrinello
   molecular dynamics (CPMD) method at 333 K (60 degrees C). It was be
   found that two of the Al-H bond lengths increased from approximately 1.
   64 to 1. 74 and 1. 93 angstrom respectively in the AlH4 groups of the
   Ti-doped alloy. Compared with this change, the four Al-H bond lengths
   almost kept invariant in the group of un-doped alloy, which means that
   it was easier to dehydrogenate for the Ti-doped alloy than un-doped
   alloy. There was no bonding tendency between atom Ti and Al observed,
   which is probably because the temperature in the simulation process is
   not high enough. Based on the obtained surface crystal configuration,
   the Ti K-edge x ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of
   the TiAl3, TiH2 crystals and Na8Ti8Al16H64 (001) surface crystal have
   been calculated by using the full-potential linearized augmented plane
   wave method (FPLAPW). It was also found that the atom Ti may not only
   exist in the mixture of TiAl3 and TiH2 but also probably partially
   substitute for the Na atoms in NaAlH4 surface crystal, by comparing the
   experimental XANES and edge x ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)

Abstract = {{The plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) belongs to the
   equilibrative nucleoside transporter family (solute carrier 29) and was
   alternatively named equilibrative nucleoside transporter 4. Previous
   studies from our laboratory characterized PMAT as a polyspecific organic
   cation transporter that minimally interacts with nucleosides. Recently,
   PMAT-mediated uptake of adenosine (a purine nucleoside) was reported,
   and the transporter was proposed to function as a dual
   nucleoside/organic cation transporter. To clarify the substrate
   specificity of PMAT, we comprehensively analyzed the transport activity
   of human PMAT toward nucleosides, nucleobases, and organic cations in
   heterologous expression systems under well controlled conditions. Among
   12 naturally occurring nucleosides and nucleobases, only adenosine was
   significantly transported by PMAT. PMAT-mediated adenosine transport is
   saturable, pH-dependent, and membrane-potential sensitive. Under both
   neutral (pH 7.4) and acidic (pH 6.6) conditions, adenosine is
   transported by PMAT at an efficiency (V-max/K-m) at least 10-fold lower
   than that of the organic cation substrates 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium
   and serotonin. PMAT-mediated adenosine uptake rate was significantly
   enhanced by an acidic extracellular pH. However, the effect of acidic pH
   was not adenosine-specific but was common to organic cation substrates
   as well. Our results demonstrated that although PMAT transports
   adenosine, the transporter kinetically prefers organic cation
   substrates. Functionally, PMAT should be viewed as a polyspecific
   organic cation transporter rather than an archetypical nucleoside
   transporter.}},

Abstract = {{Background Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a new, widely
   accepted method for the treatment of early gastric cancer and was
   developed to increase the en bloc resection rate. This study aimed to
   evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESD compared with conventional
   endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for small rectal carcinoid tumors.
   Methods A retrospective study was carried out that included 43 patients
   with small rectal carcinoid tumors (<10 mm). The cohort comprised two
   groups: Group A (N = 23) underwent conventional EMR from January 2004 to
   August 2005, while group B (N = 20) underwent ESD with needle-knife from
   September 2005 to December 2006. The rate of curative en bloc resection,
   the procedure time, and the incidence of complications were evaluated.
   Results The en bloc resection rate and the rate of completeness of
   resection of group B were higher than those of group A (100 vs. 87\%,
   100 vs. 52.5\%, respectively). The average operation time required for
   resection was significantly longer in group B (28.4 +/- 17.2 min)
   compared with group A (12.3 +/- 15.4 min) (p < 0.05). None of the
   patients had immediate or delayed bleeding during the procedure.
   Perforation occurred in one case of group B and the patient recovered
   after several days of conservative treatment. Three patients had local
   recurrence after EMR, while no patient experienced recurrence after ESD.
   Conclusion ESD, compared with conventional EMR, increased en bloc and
   histologically complete resection rates and may reduce local recurrence
   rate for small rectal carcinoid tumors. Increased operation time and
   complication risks with ESD remain problematic. Further technique and
   investigation are required to confirm the safety and to assess the
   long-term prognosis of ESD.}},

Abstract = {{As a collective and highly dynamic social group, the human crowd is a
   fascinating phenomenon that has been frequently studied by experts from
   various areas. Recently, computer-based modeling and simulation
   technologies have emerged to support investigation of the dynamics of
   crowds, such as a crowd's behaviors under normal and emergent
   situations. This article assesses the major existing technologies for
   crowd modeling and simulation. We first propose a two-dimensional
   categorization mechanism to classify existing work depending on the size
   of crowds and the time-scale of the crowd phenomena of interest. Four
   evaluation criteria have also been introduced to evaluate existing crowd
   simulation systems from the point of view of both a modeler and an
   end-user.
   We have discussed some influential existing work in crowd modeling and
   simulation regarding their major features, performance as well as the
   technologies used in this work. We have also discussed some open
   problems in the area. This article will provide the researchers with
   useful information and insights on the state of the art of the
   technologies in crowd modeling and simulation as well as future research

Abstract = {{We propose that a C-type lectin receptor, SIGNR-1 (also called Cd209b),
   helps to condition dendritic cells (DCs) in the gastrointestinal lamina
   propria (LPDCs) for the induction of oral tolerance in a model of
   food-induced anaphylaxis. Oral delivery of BSA bearing 51 molecules of
   mannoside (Man(51)-BSA) substantially reduced the BSA-induced
   anaphylactic response. Man(51)-BSA selectively targeted LPDCs that
   expressed SIGNR1 and induced the expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10),
   but not IL-6 or IL-12 p70. We found the same effects in IL-10-GFP
   knock-in (tiger) mice treated with Man(51)-BSA. The Man(51)-BSA-SIGNR1
   axis in LPDCs, both in vitro and in vivo, promoted the generation of
   CD4(+) type 1 regulatory T (Tr1)-like cells that expressed IL-10 and
   interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), in a SIGNR-1-and IL-10-dependent manner,
   but not of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. The Tr1-like cells
   could transfer tolerance. These results suggest that sugar-modified
   antigens might be used to induce oral tolerance by targeting SIGNR1 and
   LPDCs.}},

Abstract = {{Sputum is the most common sample collected from patients suffering from
   lower respiratory tract infections and it is crucial for the bacterial
   identification of these infections. In this study, we enrolled 101
   sputum samples from 101 patients with lower respiratory tract
   infections. Initially, pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA V3 hypervariable
   regions of the bacteria contained in the sputum was utilized as a
   culture-independent approach for microbiota analysis. For comparison,
   clinical laboratory tests using a culture-dependent automated bacterial
   identification system for the same cohort of sputum samples were also
   done. By pyrosequencing, > 70,000 DNA fragments were found and
   classified into 129 bacterial genera after being analyzed by the
   Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) process. Most sequences belonged to
   several predominant genera, such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus,
   indicating that these genera play an important role in lower respiratory
   tract infections. In addition, some sequences belonging to potential
   causative agents, such as Mycoplasma, Haemophilus, and Moraxella, were
   also found, but these sequences were not found by clinical laboratory
   tests. For the nine genera detected by both methods, the methods'
   sensitivities were compared and the results showed that pyrosequencing
   was more sensitive, except for Klebsiella and Mycobacterium.
   Significantly, this method revealed much more complicated bacterial
   communities and it showed a promising ability for the detection of
   bacteria.}},

   suggesting that NS3 and NS5A competitively bind the same sites in IRES
   RNA sequence, thus hampering the interaction CSFV NS3 and IRES. But.
   CSFV NS5B was not found to interact with the IRES. The inhibitive effect

Abstract = {{Background: Interest in menopausal symptoms in general and hot flushes
   (HFs) in particular has grown in recent years. This is mostly due to
   increased awareness and the vast impact these symptoms have on women's
   lives. Despite the high prevalence of women who experience HFs, a
   definitive etiology for HFs is yet to be found. Our objective was to
   review the current literature dealing with associated factors for
   experiencing HFs and to provide a synthesized overview on this common
   and often debilitating condition.
   Methods: We systematically searched the English-language literature in
   the PubMed database using relevant key words and included only those
   articles that contained information on associated factors for HFs in
   generally healthy midlife women.
   Results: Both conflicting scientific results between studies documenting
   factors that influence HFs and the lack of validated measuring tools
   make it difficult to truly pinpoint associated factors for HFs.
   Nonetheless, we identified the following clusters of associated factors:
   the menopausal stages, sex steroid hormones, other endocrine agents,
   genetic polymorphisms, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and
   obesity, mood disorders, smoking, soy isoflavones and phytoestrogens,
   alcohol consumption, and physical activity.
   Conclusions: No single associated factor was consistently identified as
   having a major role in experiencing HFs. More resources should be
   directed to develop a unified study system along with multivariable
   analyses to get a better understanding of this condition, which often
   imposes a tremendous social and personal toll on the women who
   experience it.}},

   Although the patient with an ETT in situ regurgitated intraoperatively,
   the presence of the ETT prevented aspiration and any further potential
   complications. We review the perioperative complications typically
   observed in patients with CIPA and discuss the risks of using an LMA in
   these patients. We recommend that patients with CIPA always should be
   considered as having a ``full stomach{''}, regardless of the duration of
   their NPO status, due to their coexisting ANS abnormalities. Therefore,
   rapid-sequence induction with an ETT should be utilized for the
   anesthetic management in every patient with CIPA.}},

Abstract = {{A novel meshless technique termed the Random Integral Quadrature (RIQ)
   method is developed in this paper for solving the generalized integral
   equations. By the RIQ method, the governing equations in the integral
   form are discretized directly with the field nodes distributed randomly
   or uniformly, which is achieved by discretizing the integral governing
   equations with the generalized integral quadrature (GIQ) technique over
   a set of background virtual nodes, and then interpolating the function
   values at the virtual nodes over a set of field nodes with Local Kriging
   method, where the field nodes are distributed either randomly or
   uniformly. The RIQ method is a meshless technique since it doesn't
   require any approximation cells, but a set of field nodes distributed
   either randomly or uniformly in the computational domain. In order to
   validate the RIQ method, the second kind of Fredholm integral equations
   in one-, two- and three-dimensional domains are solved via both randomly
   and uniformly distributed field nodes. Corresponding convergence rate is
   also studied for each of the case studies. The numerical solutions of
   all these case studies demonstrate that the RIQ method can achieve
   highly computational accuracy, even if only a few field nodes are
   scattered in the domains, and also make good convergence rates.}},

Abstract = {{Aims:
   The aim of this study was to demonstrate the validity and reliability of
   the short form of the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale in Southern
   Brazil.
   Material \& Methods:
   Research volunteers completed the Postpartum Depression Screening
   Scale-Short Form (PDSS-SF) and a Structured Clinical Interview for
   Mental Disorders (SCID). Evaluation parameters included reliability and
   correlational investigations analyses.
   Results:
   The proposed Portuguese version of the PDSS-SF attained significant
   Cronbach's alphas (0.71 or superior). The best cut-off score (>= 17)
   accounted for 89\% of sensitivity and 77\% of specificity. In addition,
   nonparametric correlation procedures revealed a significant correlation
   between the screening results of the PDSS-SF and the assessment based on
   the SCID.
   Conclusions:
   The Portuguese version of the PDSS-SF demonstrated sound psychometric
   properties. The results of the correlation analyses between the PDSS-SF
   and the SCID assessment also indicate a significant concurrent validity.
   The Portuguese version of the PDSS was adequately translated and adapted
   to Portuguese.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized
   by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra and the
   formation of ubiquitin- and alpha-synuclein (aSYN)-positive cytoplasmic
   inclusions called Lewy bodies (LBs). Although most PD cases are
   sporadic, families with genetic mutations have been found. Mutations in
   PARK7/DJ-1 have been associated with autosomal recessive early-onset PD,
   while missense mutations or duplications of aSYN (PARK1, PARK4) have
   been linked to dominant forms of the disease. In this study, we identify
   the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated factor
   6 (TRAF6) as a common player in genetic and sporadic cases. TRAF6 binds
   misfolded mutant DJ-1 and aSYN. Both proteins are substrates of TRAF6
   ligase activity in vivo. Interestingly, rather than conventional K63
   assembly, TRAF6 promotes atypical ubiquitin linkage formation to both PD
   targets that share K6-, K27- and K29- mediated ubiquitination.
   Importantly, TRAF6 stimulates the accumulation of insoluble and
   polyubiquitinated mutant DJ-1 into cytoplasmic aggregates. In human
   post-mortem brains of PD patients, TRAF6 protein colocalizes with aSYN
   in LBs. These results reveal a novel role for TRAF6 and for atypical
   ubiquitination in PD pathogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the midterm results and experience of a single center
   of transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect
   (VSD) with Amplatzer membranous VSD occluders. Data of 301 patients who
   underwent attempted transcatheter closure were collected prospectively
   from May 2002 to December 2008. Patients' mean age was 9.8 years, and
   their mean weight was 32 kg. The procedure was successful in 294
   patients (97.6\%). No death occurred. Complications included aortic
   regurgitation in 11 patients (3.7\%, 2 requiring occluder retrieving),
   tricuspid regurgitation in 16 patients (5.4\%), hemolysis in 2 patients
   (0.7\%), and complete atrioventricular block (cAVB) in 17 patients (15
   early cAVBs, 3 late cAVBs, 1 patient had early and late cAVBs). Among
   the 15 early cAVBs, 12 were transient and 3 were considered prolonged
   cAVBs (persisted >2 weeks). The 3 patients underwent surgery (1.0\%) and
   obtained stable sinus rhythm. Pacemaker implantation was needed in all 3
   patients with late cAVB (1.0\%). Univariate analysis showed that risk
   factors were age (p = 0.01) and weight (p = 0.021). No risk factors were
   found in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, midterm results of
   transcatheter closure of perimembranous VSD showed high closure rate and
   limited complications. The major concern is the occurrence of cAVB.
   Long-term investigation is needed to assess the efficacy and safety

Abstract = {{The special natural environment of mountainous urban and population
   concentration as well as large numbers of constructions accompanied with
   rapid urbanization is leading to more and more frequent disasters. The
   disaster-prevention control in mountainous urban design is based on
   following guideline achievements conformed by disaster-prevention
   planning for mountainous urban: the urban planar structure, land use,
   road traffic, and etc.. It offers a more direct method to deal with the
   relationship among three-dimensional mountainous urban space
   environment, human, disasters, and so on. It also becomes a main link
   between disaster-prevention planning for mountainous urban and
   disaster-prevention design for mountainous architecture.
   Through the analysis on correlative literatures and studies, this
   article summed up 6 pieces of comprehensive controlling items and 28
   pieces of detailed controlling factors. In case of Chongqing City,
   focusing on different professional respondents of urban planning
   administrators, urban designers, research and teaching stuffs, a
   questionnaire survey and an analytic hierarchy process (A.H.P) were
   applied for factor weight studies. Then this research drew a conclusion
   of the weight taxis of the factors in disaster-prevention control in
   mountainous urban design by synthetically analyzing the different
   evaluations from the administrators, urban designers and researchers.
   The achievement can be a reference and a meteyard of the design
   productions in further administration and practices of
   disaster-prevention control in mountainous urban design, and then put
   the urban disaster-prevention planning into effect concretely in the
   three-dimensional space environment of mountainous cities.}},

Abstract = {{The growing pressure on fresh water resources demands that agriculture
   becomes more productive with its current water use. Increasing water
   productivity is an often cited solution, though the current levels of
   water productivity are not systematically mapped. A global map of water
   productivity helps to identify where water resources are productively
   used, and identifies places where improvements are possible. The WATPRO
   water productivity model for wheat, using remote sensing data products
   as input, was applied at a global scale with global data sets of the
   NDVI and surface albedo to benchmark water productivity of wheat for the
   beginning of this millennium. Time profiles of the NDVI were used to
   determine the time frame from crop establishment to harvest on a pixel
   basis, which was considered the modelling period. It was found that
   water productivity varies from approximately 0.2 to 1.8 kg of
   harvestable wheat per cubic metre of water consumed. From the 10 largest
   producers of wheat, France and Germany score the highest country average
   water productivity of 1.42 and 1.35 kg m(-3), respectively. The results
   were compared with modelling information by Liu et al. (2007) who
   applied the GEPIC model at a global scale to map water productivity, and
   by Chapagain and Hoekstra (2004) who used FAO statistics to determine
   water productivity per country. A comparison with Liu et al. showed a
   good correlation for most countries, but the correlation with the
   results by Chapagain and Hoekstra was less obvious. The global patterns
   of the water productivity map were compared with global data sets of
   precipitation and reference evapotranspiration to determine the impact
   of climate and of water availability reflected by precipitation. It
   appears that the highest levels of water productivity are to be expected
   in temperate climates with high precipitation. Due to its non-linear
   relationship with precipitation, iris expected that large gains in water
   productivity can be made with in situ rain water harvesting or
   supplemental irrigation in dry areas with low seasonal precipitation. A
   full understanding of the spatial patterns by country or river basin
   will support decisions on where to invest and what measures to take to
   make agriculture more water productive. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper describes the first observations in the National Spherical

   (2001)] of ``quiet periods{''} in the edge turbulence preceding the
   low-to-high (L-H) mode transition, as diagnosed by the gas puff imaging
   (GPI) diagnostic near the outer midplane separatrix. During these quiet
   periods the GPI D-alpha light emission pattern was transiently similar
   to that seen during H-mode, i.e., with a relatively small fraction of
   the GPI light emission located outside the separatrix. These quiet
   periods had a frequency of similar to 3 kHz for at least 30 ms before
   the L-H transition, and were correlated with changes in the direction of
   the local poloidal velocity. The GPI turbulence images were also
   analyzed to obtain an estimate for the dimensionless poloidal shearing S
   = (dV(p)/dr)(L-r/L-p)tau. The values of S were strongly modulated by the
   quiet periods but did not significantly vary during the similar to 30 ms
   preceding the L-H transition. Since neither the quiet periods nor the
   shear flow increased immediately preceding the L-H transition, neither
   of these appears to be the trigger for this transition, at least for
   these cases in NSTX. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

   Using Graph Theory}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cell cooperation is a critical event during tissue
   development. We present the first precise metrics to quantify the
   interaction between mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and extra cellular
   matrix (ECM). In particular, we describe cooperative collagen alignment
   process with respect to the spatio-temporal organization and function of
   mesenchymal stem cells in three dimensions.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We defined two precise metrics: Collagen
   Alignment Index and Cell Dissatisfaction Level, for quantitatively
   tracking type I collagen and fibrillogenesis remodeling by mesenchymal
   stem cells over time. Computation of these metrics was based on graph
   theory and vector calculus. The cells and their three dimensional type I
   collagen microenvironment were modeled by three dimensional cell-graphs
   and collagen fiber organization was calculated from gradient vectors.
   With the enhancement of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation,
   acceleration through different phases was quantitatively demonstrated.
   The phases were clustered in a statistically significant manner based on
   collagen organization, with late phases of remodeling by untreated cells
   clustering strongly with early phases of remodeling by differentiating
   cells. The experiments were repeated three times to conclude that the
   metrics could successfully identify critical phases of collagen
   remodeling that were dependent upon cooperativity within the cell
   population.
   Conclusions/Significance: Definition of early metrics that are able to
   predict long-term functionality by linking engineered tissue structure
   to function is an important step toward optimizing biomaterials for the
   purposes of regenerative medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Drosophila Fallen, 1823 (Diptera, Drosophilidae) is for long a
   well-established model organism for genetics and evolutionary research.
   The ecology of these flies, however, has only recently been better
   studied. Recent papers show that Drosophila assemblies can be used as
   bioindicators of forested environment degradation. In this work the
   bioindicator potential of drosophilids was evaluated in a naturally
   opened environment, a coastal strand-forest (restinga). Data from nine
   consecutive seasonal collections revealed strong temporal fluctuation
   pattern of the majority of Drosophila species groups. Drosophila
   willistoni group was more abundant at autumns, whereas D. cardini and D.
   tripunctata groups were, respectively, expressive at winters and
   springs, and D. repleta group at both seasons. The exotic species D.
   simulans Sturtevant, 1919 (from D. melanogaster group) and Zaprionus
   indianus Gupta, 1970 were most abundant at summers. Overall, the
   assemblage structure did not show the same characteristics of forested
   or urban environments, but was similar to the forests at winters and to
   cities at summers. This raises the question that this locality may
   already been under urbanization impact. Also, this can be interpreted as
   an easily invaded site for exotic species, what might lead to biotic
   homogenization and therefore can put in check the usage of drosophilid
   assemblages as bioindicators at open environments.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analytic study of traveling fronts, localized colonies,
   and extended patterns arising from a reaction-diffusion equation which
   incorporates simultaneously two features: the well-known Allee effect
   and spatially nonlocal competition interactions. The former is an
   essential ingredient of most systems in population dynamics and involves
   extinction at low densities, growth at higher densities, and saturation
   at still higher densities. The latter feature is also highly relevant,

Abstract = {{We present the first kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations of elementary
   processes corresponding to temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
   experiments of unpromoted MoS2-based gamma-Al2O3-supported
   hydrodesulfurization catalysts. The active Mo-edge surfaces in
   interaction with the gas phase are represented by a one-dimensional
   periodic array of alternating ``top{''} and ``bridge{''} sites covered
   by surface species involved in the pathways connecting dissociative
   adsorption of dihydrogen and associative desorption of hydrogen sulfide.
   The simulations are monitored by setting partial pressures of H-2 and
   H2S, and temperature or rate of temperature increase. Configuration
   energies and transition barriers computed by DFT were supplemented by a
   semi-empirical bond-counting scheme and Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi
   relationships. Simulated TPR spectra closely match the experimental

Title = {{Human Impacts Flatten Rainforest-Savanna Gradient and Reduce Adaptive
   Diversity in a Rainforest Bird}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Ecological gradients have long been recognized as important regions for
   diversification and speciation. However, little attention has been paid
   to the evolutionary consequences or conservation implications of human
   activities that fundamentally change the environmental features of such
   gradients. Here we show that recent deforestation in West Africa has
   homogenized the rainforest-savanna gradient, causing a loss of adaptive
   phenotypic diversity in a common rainforest bird, the little greenbul
   (Andropadus virens). Previously, this species was shown to exhibit
   morphological and song divergence along this gradient in Central Africa.
   Using satellite-based estimates of forest cover, recent morphological
   data, and historical data from museum specimens collected prior to
   widespread deforestation, we show that the gradient has become shallower
   in West Africa and that A. virens populations there have lost
   morphological variation in traits important to fitness. In contrast, we
   find no loss of morphological variation in Central Africa where there
   has been less deforestation and gradients have remained more intact.
   While rainforest deforestation is a leading cause of species extinction,
   the potential of deforestation to flatten gradients and inhibit
   rainforest diversification has not been previously recognized. More
   deforestation will likely lead to further flattening of the gradient and
   loss of diversity, and may limit the ability of species to persist under
   future environmental conditions.}},

Title = {{Transition to miscibility in linearly coupled binary dipolar
   Bose-Einstein condensates}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the effects of dipole-dipole (DD) interactions on
   immiscibility-miscibility transitions (IMT's) in two-component
   Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC's) trapped in the harmonic-oscillator
   (HO) potential, with the components linearly coupled by a resonant
   electromagnetic field (accordingly, the components represent two
   different spin states of the same atom). The problem is studied by means
   of direct numerical simulations. Different mutual orientations of the
   dipolar moments in the two components are considered. It is shown that,
   in the binary BEC formed by dipoles with the same orientation and equal
   magnitudes, the IMT cannot be induced by the DD interaction alone, being
   possible only in the presence of the linear coupling between the
   components, while the miscibility threshold is affected by the DD
   interactions. However, in the binary condensate with the two dipolar
   components polarized in opposite directions, the IMT can be induced
   without any linear coupling. Further, we demonstrate that those miscible
   and immiscible localized states, formed in the presence of the DD
   interactions, which are unstable evolve into robust breathers, which
   tend to keep the original miscibility or immiscibility, respectively. An
   exception is the case of a very strong DD attraction, when narrow
   stationary modes are destroyed by the instability. The binary BEC
   composed of copolarized dipoles with different magnitudes are briefly
   considered as well.}},

Abstract = {{The role of drought-induced prolme accumulation in coconut leaves is
   still unclear With the objective of evaluating the impact of water
   shortage on leaf osmotic potential, prolme accumulation and cell
   membrane stability in young plants of two Brazilian Green Dwarf coconut
   ecotypes from contrasting areas (Brazilian Green Dwarf from Una, Bahia,
   UGD, and from Jiqui. Rio Gi ande do Norte, JGD), a pot experiment was
   conducted under greenhouse conditions. Three drought cycles consisting
   of suspension of irrigation until the net photosynthetic rate (A)
   approached zero and rewatering until ecovery of A to 85\% of the
   irrigated control plants Pre-dawn leaf water potential (psi(PD)) reached
   -1 2 MPa at the point of maximum stress (PMS) Dry matter production and
   leaf area were severely reduced by drought treatment in the two ecotypes
   Corrected values of osmotic potential were significantly reduced in
   stressed plants of the two ecotypes. Green dwarf coconut palm showed low
   osmotic adjustment (from 005 to 0.24 MPa) and significant accumulation
   of proline (from 1.5 to 2 1 times in relation to control) in leaflets in
   response to water deficit. Considering the growth reduction observed in
   both ecotypes, proline was not associated to osmoregulation On the other
   hand, the absence of membrane damage. as indicated by electrolyte
   leakage method, suggests that the protective role of praline in this
   specie can be more important The two ecotypes of Green dwarf coconut
   palm behaved similarly in the present experiment for most traits
   evaluated Slight differences among the ecotypes were observed with
   respect to the response to treatments, such as higher proline
   accumulation in JGD Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier BV

   solvent properties, such as the dielectric constants, relaxation time,
   and molecular moment of inertia, as well as the solute properties
   characterizing the vibronic surfaces, The ultrafast dynamics following
   photoexcitation is simulated using a surface hopping method in
   conjunction with the Langevin equation of motion. This methodology is
   used to examine a series of model photoinduced PCET systems, where the
   initial nonequilibrium state is prepared by vertical photoexcitation
   from the ground electronic state to the donor electronic state. Analysis
   of the dynamical trajectories provides insight into the interplay
   between the solvent dynamics and the electron-proton transfer for these
   types of processes. In addition, these model studies illustrate how the
   coupling between the electron-proton transfer and the solvent dynamics
   can be tuned by altering the solute and solvent properties.}},

Abstract = {{Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry is a
   clinical standard procedure for diagnosis, classification, and
   monitoring of hematologic malignancies. Antibody-based cell surface
   phenotyping is commonly limited to cell surface proteins for which
   specific antibodies are available and the number of parallel
   measurements is limited. The resulting limited knowledge about cell
   surface protein markers hampers early clinical diagnosis and
   subclassification of hematologic malignancies. Here, we describe the
   mass spectrometry based phenotyping of 2 all-trans retinoic acid treated
   acute myeloid leukemia model systems at an unprecedented level to a
   depth of more than 500 membrane proteins, including 137 bona fide cell
   surface exposed CD proteins. This extensive view of the leukemia surface
   proteome was achieved by developing and applying new implementations of
   the Cell Surface Capturing (CSC) technology. Bioinformatic and
   hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the applied strategy reliably
   revealed known differentiation-induced abundance changes of cell surface
   proteins in HL60 and NB4 cells and it also identified cell surface
   proteins with very little prior information. The extensive and
   quantitative analysis of the cell surface protein landscape from a
   systems biology perspective will be most useful in the clinic for the
   improved subclassification of hematologic malignancies and the
   identification of new drug targets. (Blood. 2010;116(13):e26-e34)}},

Abstract = {{Electrodeposition is a widely used technique for the fabrication of high
   aspect ratio microstructures. In recent years, much research has been
   focused within this area aiming to understand the physics behind the
   filling of high aspect ratio vias and trenches on substrates and in
   particular how they can be made without the formation of voids in the
   deposited material. This paper reports on the fundamental work towards
   the advancement of numerical algorithms that can predict the
   electrodeposition process in micron scaled features. Two different
   numerical approaches have been developed, which capture the motion of
   the deposition interface and 2-D simulations are presented for both
   methods under two deposition regimes: those where surface kinetics is
   governed by Ohm's law and the Butler-Volmer equation, respectively.
   In the last part of this paper the modelling of acoustic forces and
   their subsequent impact on the deposition profile through convection is
   examined. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Predators Are Attracted to the Olfactory Signals of Prey}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Predator attraction to prey social signals can force prey to
   trade-off the social imperatives to communicate against the profound
   effect of predation on their future fitness. These tradeoffs underlie
   theories on the design and evolution of conspecific signalling systems
   and have received much attention in visual and acoustic signalling
   modes. Yet while most territorial mammals communicate using olfactory
   signals and olfactory hunting is widespread in predators, evidence for
   the attraction of predators to prey olfactory signals under field
   conditions is lacking.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To redress this fundamental issue, we
   examined the attraction of free-roaming predators to discrete patches of
   scents collected from groups of two and six adult, male house mice, Mus
   domesticus, which primarily communicate through olfaction.
   Olfactorily-hunting predators were rapidly attracted to mouse scent
   signals, visiting mouse scented locations sooner, and in greater number,
   than control locations. There were no effects of signal concentration on
   predator attraction to their prey's signals.
   Conclusions/Significance: This implies that communication will be costly
   if conspecific receivers and eavesdropping predators are simultaneously
   attracted to a signal. Significantly, our results also suggest that
   receivers may be at greater risk of predation when communicating than
   signallers, as receivers must visit risky patches of scent to perform
   their half of the communication equation, while signallers need not.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with all-trans retinoic
   acid and/or arsenic trioxide represents a paradigm in targeted cancer
   therapy because these drugs cause clinical remission by affecting the
   stability of the fusion oncoprotein promyelocytic leukemia
   (PML)/retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA). The authors of previous
   studies have implicated the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as the main
   mechanism involved in therapy-induced PML/RARA degradation. Here we have
   investigated a role of autophagy, a protein degradation pathway that
   involves proteolysis of intracellular material within lysosomes. We
   found that both all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide induce
   autophagy via the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in APL cells and
   that autophagic degradation contributes significantly both to the basal
   turnover as well as the therapy-induced proteolysis of PML/RARA. In
   addition, we observed a correlation between autophagy and
   therapy-induced differentiation of APL cells. Given the central role of
   the PML/RARA oncoprotein in APL pathogenesis, this study highlights an
   important role of autophagy in the development and treatment of this
   disease. (Blood. 2010;116(13):2324-2331)}},

Abstract = {{Marek's disease is a devastating neoplastic disease of chickens caused
   by Marek's disease virus (MDV). MDV down-regulates surface expression of
   MHC class I molecules, although the mechanism has remained elusive. MDV
   harbors a UL49.5 homolog that has been shown to down-regulate MHC class
   I expression in other Varicelloviruses. Using in vitro assays, we showed
   that MDV pUL49.5 down-regulates MHC class I directly and identified its
   cytoplasmic tail as essential for this function. In vivo, viruses
   lacking the cytoplasmic tail of pUL49.5 showed no differences in MD
   pathogenesis compared to revertant viruses in highly susceptible
   chickens of the (BB19)-B-19 MHC class I haplotype, while there was a
   mild reduction in pathogenic potential of the deletion viruses in
   chickens more resistant to MD pathogenesis (MHC:(BB21)-B-21). We
   concluded that the pathogenic effect of MHC class I down-regulation
   mediated by pUL49.5 is small because virus immune evasion possibly
   requires more than one viral protein. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The Epinephelus aeneus (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1817) diet on the
   Ivorian Coastline (Ivory Coast) has been surveyed during 2006 and 2007,
   according to specimen size and seasons. A total of 802 individuals
   caught with hook whose total length varied between 21 cm and 106 cm and
   weighs between 100 g and 14,900 g have been examined. A total of 2,417
   prey have been identified, the weight of which being of 16,977 g. 529
   digestive tracts (66\%) were empty and 273 (34\%) contained prey. The
   relative importance index (IRI), that combines the three main describers
   of ingested prey presence (\%F, \%N, \%W) was used to characterize the
   relative importance of the various food taxa identified in digestive
   tracts. The diet of Epinephelus aeneus did not vary much. This grouper
   mainly fed on bony fish, especially serranids and carangids. The
   secondary prey were crustaceans, among which crabs occupied a
   preferential choice. Statistical analyses of food variations revealed a
   key difference between the individual diet and size. Moreover, as far as
   hydrological seasons are concerned, no difference was noticed among the
   various diets, except for the two low seasons (cold and hot).}},

Abstract = {{Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can be reduced to dimethyl sulfide by MsrA,
   which stereospecifically catalyzes the reduction of
   methionine-S-sulfoxide to methionine. Our previous study showed that
   DMSO can competitively inhibit methionine sulfoxide reduction ability of
   yeast and mammalian MsrA in both in vitro and in vivo, and also act as a
   non-competitive inhibitor for mammalian MsrB2, specific for the
   reduction of methionine-R-sulfoxide, with lower inhibition effects. The
   present study investigated the effects of DMSO on the physiological
   antioxidant functions of methionine sulfoxide reductases. DMSO elevated
   hydrogen peroxide-mediated Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell death, whereas
   it protected human SK-Hep1 cells against oxidative stress. DMSO reduced
   the protein-carbonyl content in yeast cells in normal conditions, but
   markedly increased protein-carbonyl accumulation under oxidative stress.
   Using Msr deletion mutant yeast cells, we demonstrated the DMSO's
   selective inhibition of the antioxidant function of MsrA in S.
   cerevisiae, resulting in an increase in oxidative stress-induced
   cytotoxicity. {[}BMB reports 2010; 43(9): 622-628]}},

Title = {{A total volatile inventory for Masaya Volcano, Nicaragua}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{We present results from a campaign in March 2009 to assess the current
   state of emissions from Masaya Volcano, Nicaragua. These results
   constitute one of the most comprehensive inventories to date of
   emissions from an active volcano and update the exceptional record of
   emissions from Masaya. Results from open-path Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy and filter packs demonstrate that, in terms of H2O, SO2,
   CO2, HCl, and HF (molar H2O/SO2 = 63, CO2/SO2 = 2.7, SO2/HCl = 1.7,
   SO2/HF = 8.8), the 2009 gas composition was highly comparable to that
   from the 1998 to 2000 period, indicating stability of the shallow magma
   system. This continuity extends to certain aerosol species (molar
   SO2/SO42- = 190, Na+/SO42- = 0.68, K+/SO42- = 0.71, Ca2+/SO42- = 1.6 x
   10(-2), Mg2+/SO42- = 3.6 x 10(-3)) and, to a lesser extent, the heavy
   halogens (i.e., molar HCl/HBr = 2.4 x 10(3), HCl/HI = 5.0 x 10(4)). In
   contrast to an earlier study at Masaya, we did not detect HNO3. SO2
   fluxes were low (690 Mg d(-1)), suggesting that Masaya was close to the
   minimum of its degassing cycle. By combining compositional results with
   the SO2 flux, we estimate a total volatile flux of 14,000 Mg d(-1). This
   rate is consistent with 1-4 wt\% volatile loss from a convective magma
   flux of 17,000-4000 kg s(-1). These results will allow for a better
   understanding of degassing processes at Masaya and other basaltic
   volcanoes.}},

Abstract = {{HIV-1 specific HLA-B-restricted CD8+ T cell responses differ from
   HLA-C-restricted responses in antiviral effectiveness. To investigate
   possible reasons for these differences, we characterized the frequency
   and polyfunctionality of immmunodominant HLA-B{*}57/85801- and
   HLA-Cw{*}07-restricted CD8+ T cells occurring concurrently in nine study
   subjects assessing IFN-gamma, INF-alpha, IL-2, MIP-1 beta, and CD107a by
   flow cytometry and analyzed sequence variation in targeted epitopes.
   HLA-B{*}57/5801 and HLA-Cw{*}07 restricted CD8+ T cells did not differ
   significantly in polyfunctionality (p = 0.84). Possession of three or
   more functions correlated positively with CD4+ T cell counts (r = 0.85;
   p = 0.006) and monofunctional CD8+ T cells inversely correlated with CD4
   cell counts (r = 0.79: p = 0.05). There were no differences in
   polyfunctionality of CD8+ T cells specific to wildtype versus mutated
   epitopes. These results suggest that loss of polyfunctionality and
   increase in monofunctional HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells are associated
   with disease progression independent of restricting HLA allele.
   Furthermore, sequence variation does not appear to significantly impact
   CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality in chronic HIV-1 infection. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Detailed analysis was conducted on large-scale gravitational-tectonic
   deformations and landslides in the Acambay graben, an intra-arc basin in
   the trans-Mexican volcanic belt (TMVB). Field mapping and remote sensing
   revealed the slope instability of the northern graben boundary induced
   by the Acambay-Tixmadeje fault. Two major landslides of 0.1 km(3) and
   0.05 km(3) in volume were identified and their characteristics were
   analyzed according to the role of tectonics, mechanism of slope failure,
   and possible triggering factors. Quaternary faulting played a major role
   in increasing the local relief, and the activity of the
   Acambay-Tixmadeje fault represents the main geomorphic factor
   conditioning the gravitational movements. Moreover, displacements along
   this fault generated sliding surfaces and reduced the strength of the
   rock mass. The two landslides are classified as large-scale rotational
   slides involving volcanic rocks of late Miocene-Pleistocene age. Since
   the Acambay graben is a seismogenic area with a known maximum horizontal
   ground acceleration of 0.5 g, a strong earthquake could be ascribed as
   the possible triggering mechanism of the landslides. Our work represents
   the first analysis of large gravitational slope movements in
   tectonically active regions in Mexico, a process that can be common in
   the intra-arc basins of the TMVB, where active tectonic, seismicity,
   weak altered volcanic rocks, and heavy rains affect the slope stability.

Abstract = {{Aiming at a better understanding of the molecular details in light
   absorption during photosynthesis, spatial and temporal correlation
   functions as well as spectral densities have been determined. At the
   focus of the present study are the light-harvesting II complexes of the
   purple bacterium Rhodospirillum molischianum. The calculations are based
   on a time-dependent combination of molecular dynamics simulations and
   quantum chemistry methods. Using a 12 Ps long trajectory, different
   quantum chemical methods have been compared to each other. Furthermore,
   several approaches to determine the couplings between the individual
   chromophores have been tested. Correlations between energy gap
   fluctuations of different individual pigments are analyzed but found to
   be negligible. From the energy gap fluctuations, spectral densities are
   extracted which serve as input for calculations of optical properties
   and exciton dynamics. To this end, the spectral densities are tested by
   determining the linear absorption of the complete two-ring system. One
   important difference from earlier studies is given by the severely
   extended length of the trajectory along which the quantum chemical
   calculations have been performed. Due to this extension, more accurate
   and reliable data have been obtained in the low frequency regime which
   is important in the dynamics of electronic relaxation.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{The Sachs equations governing the evolution of the optical matrix of
   geodetic WANDs (Weyl aligned null directions) are explicitly solved in n
   dimensions in several cases which are of interest in potential
   applications. This is then used to study Einstein spacetimes of type III
   and N in the higher dimensional Newman-Penrose formalism, considering
   both Kundt and expanding (possibly twisting) solutions. In particular,
   the general dependence of the metric and of the Weyl tensor on an affine
   parameter r is obtained in a closed form. This allows us to characterize
   the peeling behavior of the Weyl ``physical'' components for large
   values of r, and thus to discuss, e. g., how the presence of twist
   affects polarization modes, and qualitative differences between four and
   higher dimensions. Further, the r dependence of certain nonzero scalar
   curvature invariants of expanding spacetimes is used to demonstrate that
   curvature singularities may generically be present. As an illustration,
   several explicit type N/III spacetimes that solve Einstein's vacuum
   equations (with a possible cosmological constant) in higher dimensions
   are finally presented.}},

Title = {{Normalized radar cross section of the sea for backscatter: 1. Mean
   levels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{The normalized radar cross section of the sea for backscatter, sigma(o),
   is investigated for incidence angles between 0 degrees and 89 degrees
   using data collected over more than two decades. The most recent
   measurements were made from several ships using a coherent,
   dual-polarized, X band radar. These measurements show that vertically
   polarized transmit and receive signals, sigma(o)(VV), at high incidence
   angles exhibit wind speed and azimuth angle dependence similar to those
   at lower incidence angles. They are nearly as large looking downwind as
   they are looking upwind and minimize near the crosswind direction.
   Horizontally polarized transmit and receive signals, sigma(o) (HH),
   behave differently at high incidence angles. They are largest looking
   upwind and smallest looking downwind. Fits of the multiscale model of
   microwave backscatter from the ocean to these data along with data
   collected previously at lower incidence angles show that over the whole
   range of incidence angles from 0 degrees to 89 degrees, sigma(o)(VV) is
   explained by the model, while measured sigma(o)(HH) values are generally
   higher than the model predicts at incidence angles above about 45
   degrees. Thus scattering phenomena exist on the ocean surface that
   affect HH backscatter very strongly at the higher incidence angles while
   impacting VV-polarized backscatter only slightly. This conclusion is
   strengthened by our observation of high-incidence-angle backscatter from
   the ocean where mean sigma(o)(HH) exceeds mean sigma(o)(VV) by as much
   as 15 dB. We examine phenomena that might account for this behavior and
   suggest that multipath dihedral-type features are likely to be important
   scatterers since they produce large sigma(o)(HH)/sigma(o)(VV) owing to
   Brewster damping of the first VV bounce.}},

Abstract = {{The mineralization of pentafluorophenol (C6F5OH) in water using UV-C
   light and Fe(II) sulfate/Fe(III) oxalate with H2O2 was examined to
   develop a technique to counteract persistent and bioaccumulative C6F5OH
   to harmless species. Photo-Fenton process led to efficient degradation
   of C6F5OH to fluoride ions and CO2. Compared with the Fe(II)sulfate
   photo-Fenton process, the Fe(III) oxalate process is more efficient. The
   effects of various experimental parameters such as pH, initial
   concentrations of H2O2, Fe2+, Fe3+, C6F5OH and airflow rate on
   photomineralization have been investigated. GC/MS analysis of solutions
   before complete mineralization (after 30 min of irradiation) reveals the
   formation of tetrafluorodihydroxybenzene, trifluorotrihydroxybenzene and
   tetrafluoroquinone as intermediates. The products have been identified
   by comparing the molecular ion and mass fragmentation peaks of the
   product with those reported in the GC/MS library. The optimum operating
   conditions for efficient mineralization are reported. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   phase differed between the samples respectively being hard (sample A)
   and soft (sample B) relative to the primary phase. This difference was
   caused by the presence of fine to precipitates. The relative hardness of
   beta phase determined almost all aspects of deformed microstructure
   developments. In sample A, the primary phase had higher lattice strain
   and in-grain misorientation developments. In sample B, on the other
   hand, the softer beta phase was clearly linked to more deformation
   twinning and associated grain size refinement and `texturing' of the hcp

Abstract = {{Triassic pistosauroids are closely related to the Plesiosauria which
   flourished later in the Mesozoic, but their fossil record has been poor
   due to the fragmentary nature of the known specimens. Yunguisaurus liae
   Cheng et al (2006) (Reptilia, Sauropterygia) from China was the first
   Triassic pistosauroid represented by an almost complete skeleton, and we
   provide a full description of the holotype specimen based on the result
   of complete preparation of the skull and posteranium. A revised
   diagnosis characterizes Y liae by a mixture of primitive and derived
   features for sauropterygians, such as the high number of cervical
   vertebrae (similar to the Plesiosauria) with large zygapophyses (shared
   with basal sauropterygians). The holotype skeleton likely represents a
   juvenile individual. In a revised phylogeny, relationships among the
   Triassic pistosauroids are fully resolved but weakly supported; the
   revised phylogeny differs from the existing hypothesis on a
   sauropterygian relationship, likely due to the previous reliance on
   fragmentary taxa. The long neck and hyperphalangy give an impression
   that Yunguisaurus is very ``plesiosaurian,{''} but detailed comparison
   revealed morphological differences in various parts of the postcranial.
   These differences, in combination with the revised phylogenetic
   hypothesis, suggest that Yunguisaurus was not necessarily comparable to
   the Plesiosauria in terms of body plan and mode of swimming.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) films have been deposited on lithium niobate
   (LiNbO3) substrates by electron beam evaporation without any interlayer
   between them to ensure a good adhesion of the Al2O3 films to LiNbO3
   substrates. As Al2O3 thin films can sufficiently increase the surface
   acoustic wave (SAW) velocity, they can be used to improve the
   performance of the SAW device. The SAW phase velocity in the Al2O3LiNbO3
   structure was found to increase with the insertion of an Al2O3 film,
   which can be attributed to the stiffening effect of the Al2O3 layer. The
   velocity change ratio of SAW was about 4.39\% (at 304 MHz) for the Al2O3
   (9.7 pin)/LiNbO3 sample. A comparison with other findings in literature
   reveals that this result is better than what is available from
   diamond-like carbon/SiC buffer layer/LiNbO3 structure, whose the

Abstract = {{Cephalopods are primary prey to a wide range of predators in marine
   food-webs, yet a basic understanding of the mechanisms controlling
   predation risk and demand on their populations is lacking. Feeding
   experiments were conducted to evaluate how relative prey size and
   behavior mediate the susceptibility of squid to predation. Attack and
   capture of longfin inshore squid (Loligo pealeii) were quantified using
   two predators: bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) a pelagic, cruising
   predator, and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) a benthic, ambush
   forager. Predator selectivity, prey susceptibility, and prey
   profitability were estimated as a function of relative prey size from
   predator prey interactions during behavioral trials. Patterns in attack
   rates suggested that size-selection on squid was constrained by passive
   processes rather than active choice for both predators. The
   susceptibility of squid to predation by bluefish was strongly dependent
   on relative prey size; however, flounder were equally efficient at
   capturing all sizes of squid offered. Handling times increased
   exponentially with relative prey size and were the primary constraint on
   selectivity and profitability in flounder. Prey profitability was a
   dome-shaped function of relative squid size in both predators. Overall,
   the relative size and values at which profitability was maximized were
   higher in bluefish indicating they were the more efficient predator of
   squid. Squid succumbed to greater time-dependent mortality rates than
   Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) and mummichogs (Fundulus sp.)
   suggesting that when equal amounts of squid and fish are available in
   the environment, squid will be selectively ingested by bluefish and
   flounder. In addition to the influence of relative prey size, predator
   foraging behaviors and size-dependent encounter rates were thought to be
   important factors affecting selection on squid in the northwest Atlantic
   ecosystem. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the properties of silicon films obtained by
   low-pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD). Two gaseous sources
   characterized by different deposition temperatures, i.e. disilane S12H6
   (420-520 degrees C) and silane SiH4 (520-750 degrees C), was studied in
   order to understand the influences of deposition and crystallization
   kinetics on silicon film properties. Thus, the deposition of amorphous,
   semi-crystallized and polycrystalline silicon films was related to
   ``volume random{''} and ``surface columnar{''} crystallization
   phenomena, highlighting a linear relationship between the refractive
   index and the polysilicon volume fraction and, showing complex residual
   stress dependency with process conditions. Finally, by introducing the
   ratio V-d/V-c between the deposition and crystallization rates as a
   major parameter, different deposition behaviours and related
   semi-empirical relationships were defined in order to characterize fully
   the various properties of LPCVD silicon films (microstructure,
   polysilicon volume fraction, refractive index and residual stress)
   according to the chosen gaseous source, silane or disilane. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Although amygdala and frontal lobe functional abnormalities have been
   reported in patients with mood disorders, the literature regarding major
   depressive disorder (MDD) is inconsistent. Likely confounds include
   heterogeneity of patient samples, medication status, and analytic
   approach. This study evaluated the amygdala and frontal lobe activation
   in unmedicated MDD patients. Fifteen MDD patients and 15 matched healthy
   controls were scanned using fMRI during the performance of an emotional
   face task known to robustly activate the amygdala and prefrontal cortex
   (PFC). Whole-brain and region of interest analyses were performed, and
   correlations between clinical features and activation were examined.
   Significant amygdala and lateral PFC activation were seen within patient
   and control groups. In a between-group comparison, patients showed
   significantly reduced activation in the insula, temporal and occipital
   cortices. In MDD, the presence of anxiety symptoms was associated with
   decreased orbitofrontal activation. We found robust activation in both
   the MOD and control groups in fronto-limbic regions with no significant
   between-group differences using either analytic approach. The current
   study replicates previous research on unmedicated subjects showing no
   significant differences in amygdala function in depressed vs. control
   subjects with respect to simple tasks involving emotion observation. (c)

Abstract = {{Although previous work identified 12 complementation groups with
   possible roles in virus assembly, currently only one frog virus 3
   protein, the major capsid protein (MCP), has been linked with virion
   formation. To identify other proteins required for assembly, we used an
   antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to target 53R, a putative
   myristoylated membrane protein, and showed that treatment resulted in
   marked reductions in 53R levels and a 60\% drop in virus titers.
   lmmunofluorescence assays confirmed knock down and showed that 53R was
   found primarily within viral assembly sites, whereas transmission
   electron microscopy detected fewer mature virions and, in some cells,
   dense granular bodies that may represent unencapsidated DNA-protein
   complexes. Treatment with a myristoylation inhibitor (2-hydroxymyristic
   acid) resulted in an 80\% reduction in viral titers. Collectively, these
   data indicate that 53R is an essential viral protein that is required
   for replication in vitro and suggest it plays a critical role in virion
   formation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Malignant Transformation of Non-Neoplastic Barrett's Epithelial Cells
   through Well-Defined Genetic Manipulations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Human Barrett's cancer cell lines have numerous,
   poorly-characterized genetic abnormalities and, consequently, those
   lines have limited utility as models for studying the early molecular
   events in carcinogenesis. Cell lines with well-defined genetic lesions
   that recapitulate various stages of neoplastic progression in Barrett's
   esophagus would be most useful for such studies.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To develop such model cell lines, we
   started with telomerase-immortalized, nonneoplastic Barrett's epithelial
   (BAR-T) cells, which are spontaneously deficient in p16, and proceeded
   to knock down p53 using RNAi, to activate Ras by introducing oncogenic
   H-Ras(G12V), or both. BAR-T cells infected with either p53 RNAi or
   oncogenic H-Ras(G12V) alone maintained cell-to-cell contact inhibition
   and did not exhibit anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. In
   contrast, the combination of p53 RNAi knockdown with expression of
   oncogenic H-Ras(G12V) transformed the p16-deficient BAR-T cells, as
   evidenced by their loss of contact inhibition, by their formation of
   colonies in soft agar, and by their generation of tumors in
   immunodeficient mice.
   Conclusions/Significance: Through these experiments, we have generated a
   number of transformed and non-transformed cell lines with
   well-characterized genetic abnormalities recapitulating various stages
   of carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus. These lines should be useful
   models for the study of carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus, and for
   testing the efficacy of chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents.}},

Abstract = {{Polysulfone (PSF) membranes are broadly applied in the field of the
   treatment for wastewater containing oil owing to their good
   physicochemical stability, resistance to oxidation and chlorine. But
   they are easy to be contaminated by oil for its hydrophobic property,
   which limits their application in large scale. To enhance the capability
   of PSF membrane, such as hydrophilic property, anti-fouling ability and
   tensile strength, phosphorylated Zr-doped hybrid silica particles (SZP
   particles) were added to the porous matrix of PSF and a novel composite
   membrane (SZP/PSF) was prepared through a sol-gel process under optimum
   preparation conditions. The results of tensile strength and contact
   angle measurements show that the mechanical strength and hydrophilic
   property of composite membrane have been enhanced to a large extent
   respectively. SEM micrographs indicate that composite membrane with the
   asymmetry structure has both layers of compact layer and porous layer
   with SZP particles uniformly dispersed in PSF. The result shows that the
   oil concentration of 0.84 mg/L in permeation meets the standard for
   wastewater reuse (less than 10 mg/L). It can be concluded that the
   anti-fouling ability and hydrophilic property of composite membrane are
   significantly enhanced, and therefore, the novel composite membrane is
   desirable in the treatment of wastewater containing oil. (C) 2010

   Models in which isotropy is spontaneously broken (e.g., by a scalar

   models in which a preferred direction is imposed during inflation. We
   examine models inspired by these, in which isotropy is broken by a
   multiplicative factor with dipole and/or quadrupole terms. We evaluate
   the evidence provided by the multipole alignment using a Bayesian
   framework, finding that the evidence in favor of the model is generally
   weak. We also compute approximate changes in estimated cosmological
   parameters in the broken-isotropy models. Only the overall normalization
   of the power spectrum is modified significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Femtosecond laser pulses have been widely used as a tool to study
   molecular ionization and fragmentation. This article bridges the
   application of femtosecond laser technology in early research focused on
   small isolated molecules with that in modern biological mass
   spectrometry for proteomics and metabolomic analysis on large (140+
   atoms) biomolecules. The single-shot interaction of a femtosecond laser
   with neutral para-nitrotoluene (pNT) is investigated with time-of-flight
   mass spectrometry and compared with the ultrafast photodissociation of
   protonated pNT in an ion trap mass spectrometer accumulated over similar
   to 1000 pulses. The ion trap experiment is then extended to longer
   biomolecules. As demonstrated in the examples of vasopressin and
   tomatine, this novel ion activation method provides greater sequence

Abstract = {{CREB binding protein (CBP) is a transcriptional coactivator with histone
   acetyltransferase activity. Our prior study suggested that CBP might be
   a key target of presenilins in the regulation of memory formation and
   neuronal survival. To elucidate the role of CBP in the adult brain, we
   generated conditional knock-out (cKO) mice in which CBP is completely
   inactivated in excitatory neurons of the postnatal forebrain.
   Histological analysis revealed normal neuronal morphology and absence of
   age-dependent neuronal degeneration in the CBP cKO cerebral cortex. CBP
   cKO mice exhibited robust impairment in the formation of spatial,
   associative, and object-recognition memory. In addition to impaired
   long-term memory, CBP cKO mice also displayed deficits in short-term
   associative and object-recognition memory. Administration of a histone
   deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, rescued the reduction of
   acetylated histones in the CBP cKO cortex but failed to rescue either
   short-or long-term memory deficits, suggesting that the memory
   impairment may not be caused by general reduction of histone
   acetyltransferase activity in CBP cKO mice. Further microarray and
   Western analysis showed decreased expression of
   calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase isoforms and NMDA and AMPA receptor
   subunits in the cerebral cortex of CBP cKO mice. Collectively, these
   findings suggest a crucial role for CBP in the formation of both
   short-and long-term memory.}},

   Api(8) oligomer appended with a leucine derivative at its N-terminus
   showed that disruption of its helical conformation occurs in a pH range
   of 7-10. NMR studies indicated that the piperidine groups in Api(8),
   when nonprotonated, possibly interact with the proximal amide protons in
   the peptide backbone and hamper the formation of the H-bonding network
   responsible for the helical conformation. The helical structure is
   induced not only by protonation but also by acylation of the piperidine

   Sensory Neurons In Vitro}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Several alphaherpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus 1
   (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PRV), establish lifelong latency in
   neurons of the trigeminal ganglion (TG). Although it is thought that
   efficient establishment of alphaherpesvirus latency is based on a subtle
   interplay between virus, neurons and the immune system, it is not clear
   which immune components are of major importance for the establishment of
   latency.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, using an in vitro model that
   enables a natural route of infection, we show that interferon alpha
   (IFNalpha) has the previously uncharacterized capacity to induce a
   quiescent HSV-1 and PRV infection in porcine TG neurons that shows
   strong similarity to in vivo latency. IFNalpha induced a stably
   suppressed HSV-1 and PRV infection in TG neurons in vitro. Subsequent
   treatment of neurons containing stably suppressed virus with forskolin
   resulted in reactivation of both viruses. HSV and PRV latency in vivo is
   often accompanied by the expression of latency associated transcripts
   (LATs). Infection of TG neurons with an HSV-1 mutant expressing LacZ
   under control of the LAT promoter showed activation of the LAT promoter
   and RT-PCR analysis confirmed that both HSV-1 and PRV express LATs
   during latency in vitro.
   Conclusions/Significance: These data represent a unique in vitro model
   of alphaherpesvirus latency and indicate that IFNalpha may be a driving
   force in promoting efficient latency establishment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Flux variability analysis is often used to determine
   robustness of metabolic models in various simulation conditions.
   However, its use has been somehow limited by the long computation time

   Results: We present an open source implementation of flux variability
   analysis called fastFVA. This efficient implementation makes large-scale
   flux variability analysis feasible and tractable allowing more complex
   biological questions regarding network flexibility and robustness to be
   addressed.
   Conclusions: Networks involving thousands of biochemical reactions can
   be analyzed within seconds, greatly expanding the utility of flux
   variability analysis in systems biology.}},

Title = {{Entanglement entropy in quantum spin chains with broken reflection
   symmetry}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the entanglement entropy of a block of L sites in
   quasifree translation-invariant spin chains concentrating on the effect
   of reflection-symmetry breaking. The Majorana two-point functions
   corresponding to the Jordan-Wigner transformed fermionic modes are
   determined in the most general case; from these, it follows that
   reflection symmetry in the ground state can only be broken if the model
   is quantum critical. The large L asymptotics of the entropy are
   calculated analytically for general gauge-invariant models, which have,
   until now, been done only for the reflection-symmetric sector.
   Analytical results are also derived for certain nongauge-invariant
   models (e. g., for the Ising model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
   interaction). We also study numerically finite chains of length N with a
   nonreflection-symmetric Hamiltonian and report that the reflection
   symmetry of the entropy of the first L spins is violated but the
   reflection-symmetric Calabrese-Cardy formula is recovered
   asymptotically. Furthermore, for noncritical
   reflection-symmetry-breaking Hamiltonians, we find an anomaly in the
   behavior of the saturation entropy as we approach the critical line. The
   paper also provides a concise but extensive review of the block-entropy
   asymptotics in translation-invariant quasifree spin chains with an
   analysis of the nearest-neighbor case and the enumeration of the yet
   unsolved parts of the quasifree landscape.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Annual revenue flow to developing countries for ecotourism (or
   nature-based tourism) could be as large as US\$ 210 x 10(12), providing
   an enormous financial incentive against habitat loss and exploitation.
   However, is ecotourism the most privately and/or socially valuable use
   of rainforest land? The question is rarely answered because the relevant
   data, estimates of profits and fixed costs, are rarely available. We
   present a social cost-benefit analysis of land use in an ecotourism
   cluster in the Tambopata region of Amazonian Peru. The net present value
   of ecotourism-controlled land is given by the producer surplus (profits
   plus fixed costs of ecotourism lodges): US\$ 1,158 ha(-1), which is
   higher than all currently practiced alternatives, including
   unsustainable logging, ranching, and agriculture. To our knowledge, this
   is the first sector-wide study of profitability and producer surplus in
   a developing-country ecotourism sector and the first to compare against
   equivalent measures for a spectrum of alternative uses. We also find
   that ecotourism-controlled land sequesters between 5.3 to 8.7 million
   tons of above-ground carbon, which is equivalent to between 3000-5000
   years of carbon emissions from the domestic component of air and surface
   travel between the gateway city of Cusco and the lodges, at 2005
   emission rates. Ecotourism in Tambopata has successfully monetized the
   hedonic value of wild nature in Amazonian Peru, and justifies the
   maintenance of intact rainforest over all alternative uses on narrow
   economic grounds alone.}},

Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{Low-grade polymicrobial infection induced by cecal ligation and puncture
   is lethal in heme oxygenase-1-deficient mice (Hmox1(-/-)), but not in
   wild-type (Hmox1(+/+)) mice. Here we demonstrate that the protective
   effect of this heme-catabolizing enzyme relies on its ability to prevent
   tissue damage caused by the circulating free heme released from
   hemoglobin during infection. Heme administration after low-grade
   infection in mice promoted tissue damage and severe sepsis. Free heme
   contributed to the pathogenesis of severe sepsis irrespective of
   pathogen load, revealing that it compromised host tolerance to
   infection. Development of lethal forms of severe sepsis after high-grade
   infection was associated with reduced serum concentrations of the heme
   sequestering protein hemopexin (HPX), whereas HPX administration after
   high-grade infection prevented tissue damage and lethality. Finally, the
   lethal outcome of septic shock in patients was also associated with
   reduced HPX serum concentrations. We propose that targeting free heme by
   HPX might be used therapeutically to treat severe sepsis.}},

Abstract = {{The conformational equilibrium of the general anesthetic propofol
   (2,6-diisopropylphenol) has been studied in a supersonic expansion using
   broadband chirped-pulse microwave spectroscopy. Three conformers
   originated by the combined internal rotation of the hydroxyl and the two
   isopropyl groups have been detected in the jet-cooled rotational
   spectrum. The most stable conformer exhibits tunneling splittings
   associated with the internal rotation of the hydroxyl group, from which
   we determined the torsional potential and barrier heights (905-940
   cm(-1)). The carbon backbone structure was derived from the spectral
   assignments of all 12 C-13 monosubtituted isotopologues in natural
   abundance and confirmed a plane-symmetric gauche orientation of the two
   isopropyl groups (Gg) for this conformer. In the other two detected
   conformers (EG and GE) one of the isopropyl groups is eclipsed with
   respect to the ring plane while the other is gauche, differing in a
   similar to 180 degrees rotation of the hydroxyl group. Supporting ab
   initio calculations provided information on the potential energy surface
   and molecular properties of the title compound.}},

Year = {{2010}},

Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{The learning outcome of a physics laboratory course for medical students
   was examined in an interdisciplinary field study and discussed for the
   electrical physiology ({''}Propagation of Excitation and Nerve
   Cells{''}). At the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich (LMU) at a
   time about 300 medicine students were assessed in two successive years.
   Students from the control group worked with standard experiments, while
   students from the treatment group performed newly developed
   ``addressee-specific{''} experiments, designed to guide students to
   transfer physics knowledge to physiological problems. The assessment
   took place within the laboratory course on physiology, after the
   students had finished their laboratory classes in physics, and consisted
   of the construction of a concept map with additional multiple choice
   questions. The results showed that standard physics experiments are not
   adequate for teaching students to transfer physical principles to
   physiology. Introducing new addressee-specific experiments enriched the
   physics laboratory course by improving student attitudes toward physics
   and demonstrating better ability of students to relate concepts of
   physics and medicine, and overall to improve their understanding of the
   physics taught in the course.}},

Abstract = {{Absorption effects on plasmon-polariton excitations in quasiperiodic
   (Fibonacci and Thue-Morse) one-dimensional stacks composed of layers of
   right-and left-handed materials are theoretically investigated. A
   Drude-type dispersive response for both the dielectric permittivity and
   magnetic permeability of the left-handed layer is considered. Maxwell's
   equations are solved for oblique incidence by using the transfer matrix
   formalism, and the reflection coefficient as a function of the frequency
   and incidence angle is obtained. The Fibonacci (or Thue-Morse)
   quasiperiodic structure leads to a Cantor-like photonic spectra for the
   plasmon-polariton modes. Moreover, results for the photonic band
   structure, density of states and reflection coefficient indicate that
   plasmon-polariton modes are robust in the presence of low and moderate
   levels of absorption.}},

Abstract = {{We perform a study of exclusive production of Ds+Ds-,D-s{*}(+),D-s(-),
   and D-s{*}D-+(s){*}- final states in initial-state radiation events from
   e(+)e(-) annihilations at a center-of-mass energy near 10.58 GeV, to
   search for charmonium 1(--) states. The data sample corresponds to an
   integrated luminosity of 525 fb(-1) and was recorded by the BABAR
   experiment at the PEP-II storage ring. Ds+Ds-,D-s{*}(+),D-s(-) and
   ,D-s{*}(+),D-s{*}(-) mass spectra show evidence of the known psi
   resonances. Limits are extracted for the branching ratios of the decays
   X(4260) -> D-s((){*}()+) D-s((){*}()-)}},

Abstract = {{We present an optical biosensor technology that integrates the tethered
   particle motion technique and the magnetic tweezer technique. The goal
   is to quantify the three-dimensional mobility of bound particle labels
   and to characterize the bond between the particle and the surface. We
   show, using a series of four different lengths of dsDNA (105-590 bp),
   that plots of the height as a function of the in-plane particle position
   reflect the bond length and bond flexibility. We analyse ensembles of
   bound particles and show that the height displacement is at maximum the
   bond length, but that non-specific sticking causes large variations
   between particles. We also measured the height of bound particles under
   the influence of magnetic forces. A magnetic gradient force towards the
   surface brought particles on average closer to the surface, but a
   magnetic gradient force away from the surface did not bring all
   particles away from the surface. We show that the latter can be
   explained by magnetic anisotropy in the particles. Our results
   demonstrate that mobility detection of bound particle labels in an
   evanescent field is a promising technique to characterize the bond
   between a particle and a surface in a biosensor system.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the neurophysiological correlates of
   categorical perception of Chinese lexical tones in Mandarin Chinese.
   Relative to standard stimuli, both within- and across-category deviants
   elicited mismatch negativity (MMN) in bilateral frontal-central
   recording sites. The MMN elicited in the right sites was marginally
   larger than in the left sites, which reflects the role of the right
   hemisphere in acoustic processing. At the same time, relative to
   within-category deviants, the across-category deviants elicited larger
   MMN in the left recording sites, reflecting the long-term phonemic
   traces of lexical tones. These results provide strong neurophysiological
   evidence in support of categorical perception of lexical tones in
   Chinese. More important, they demonstrate that acoustic and phonological
   information is processed in parallel within the MMN time window for the
   perception of lexical tones. Finally, homologous nonspeech stimuli
   elicited similar MMN patterns, indicating that lexical tone knowledge
   influences the perception of nonspeech signals. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published

Title = {{Summertime trans-Pacific transport of Asian dust}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{In mid-August 2009, ground-based lidar networks on both sides of the
   Pacific Basin detected an elevated dust layer. A combined analysis by
   ground-based lidars, spaceb-orne lidar CALIOP, and numerical models
   revealed that dust particles emitted in the Taklimakan Desert were
   transported across the Pacific Ocean in 12 to 13 days. This was the
   first evidence of summertime trans-Pacific transport of Asian dust from
   the Taklimakan Desert. A large-scale dust storm occurred in the
   Taklimakan Desert during 12-16 August due to a strong surface wind
   accompanied by a cold front. Many dust particles were lifted up into the
   free atmosphere by the upslope wind formed by the steep slope of the
   surrounding mountains. This dust injection process was analogous to that
   for springtime cases. The Taklimakan dust was then transported eastward
   at 6-8 km altitude. This high transport altitude allowed the Taklimakan
   Dust to be transported beyond the Pacific Ocean without the effect of
   the southeasterly outflow of the summertime Pacific high. The wind field
   anomaly at 500 hPa in mid-August 2009 shows increases of northwesterly
   winds driven by SE-NW pressure gradients around 110-140 degrees E and
   180-140 degrees W, indicating that the pressure pattern during the dust
   event favored the trans-Pacific transport.

   dynamic light scattering, thermo-gravimetric analysis and microscopy.
   The micelles used here demonstrate pH-responsive behaviour both in
   solution and when adsorbed at interfaces. It has been shown that block
   copolymer micelles can selectively encapsulate and release hydrophobic
   materials; therefore, the incorporation of such responsive species
   within films has the potential to offer increased functionality. The
   formation of films onto colloidal particles is of great interest as it
   can provide pathways to direct encapsulation of materials along with
   surface modification. This study aims to provide new insights into the
   nature and properties of responsive films. Such studies will allow for
   the future development of novel delivery systems that have potential
   application within a number of industrial sectors including personal
   care products, pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{We explain the origin of the unusual large isotopic dependence found in
   charge-transfer cross sections for H( D, T)(+) + Be collisions. We show
   that this large effect appears in a semiclassical treatment as a
   consequence of the mass dependence of the charge-transfer transition
   probabilities, which is due to the variation of the radial velocity in
   the region where the nonadiabatic transitions take place. The
   possibility of finding such a large isotope effect in other collision
   systems is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have studied the effect of silica particles on the
   physical aging of nanocomposites based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PM
   MA). To do that, we have followed the enthalpy relaxation by means of
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In agreement with previous
   results carried out by means of broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS),
   we observe an acceleration of the physical aging process of PM MA
   nanocomposites in comparison to bulk PM MA. The fitting of the enthalpy
   relaxation results to the well-known Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan (TNM)
   model gives rise to equal structural parameters for all investigated
   samples. including hulk PM MA. This implies that the molecular mechanism
   for physical aging in PMMA is not affected by the presence of silica
   particles. The only parameter changing is the pre-exponential factor
   setting the time scale of physical aging. The values obtained are
   correlated to the area/volume ratio or silica particles in the polymer
   and thereby to the silica interparticle distance in the nanocomposites.
   This latter observation is an indication that the physical aging process
   is driven by the diffusion of free volume holes toward polymer
   interfaces, as already proposed in the past.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{We have measured neutron-diffraction patterns in a single-crystal sample
   of the pyrochlore compound Er2Ti2O7 in the antiferromagnetic phase
   (T=0.3 K), as a function of the magnetic field, up to 6 T, applied along
   the {[}110] direction. We determine all the characteristics of the
   magnetic structure throughout the critical point at H-c=2 T. As a main
   result, all Er moments align along the field at H-c and their values
   reach a minimum. Using a four-sublattice self-consistent calculation, we
   show that the evolution of the magnetic structure and the value of the
   critical field are rather well reproduced using the same anisotropic
   exchange tensor as that accounting for the local paramagnetic
   susceptibility. In contrast, an isotropic exchange tensor does not yield
   the correct moment variations through the critical point. The model also
   accounts semiquantitatively for other experimental data obtained in
   previous works, such as the field dependence of the heat capacity,
   energy of the dispersionless inelastic modes and transition temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Birds in the infraorder Corvida {[}1] (ravens, jays, bowerbirds) are
   renowned for their cognitive abilities {[}2-4], which include advanced
   problem solving with spatial inference {[}4-8], tool use and complex
   constructions {[}7-10], and bowerbird cognitive ability is associated
   with mating success {[}11]. Great bowerbird males construct bowers with
   a long avenue from within which females view the male displaying over
   his bower court {[}10]. This predictable audience viewpoint is a
   prerequisite for forced (altered) visual perspective {[}12-14]. Males
   make courts with gray and white objects that increase in size with
   distance from the avenue entrance. This gradient creates forced visual
   perspective for the audience; court object visual angles subtended on
   the female viewer's eye are more uniform than if the objects were placed
   at random. Forced perspective can yield false perception of size and
   distance {[}12, 15]. After experimental reversal of their size-distance
   gradient, males recovered their gradients within 3 days, and there was
   little difference from the original after 2 wks. Variation among males
   in their forced-perspective quality as seen by their female audience
   indicates that visual perspective is available for use in mate choice,
   perhaps as an indicator of cognitive ability. Regardless of function,
   the creation and maintenance of forced visual perspective is clearly
   important to great bowerbirds and suggests the possibility of a
   previously unknown dimension of bird cognition.}},

Abstract = {{We report experimental angular differential cross sections for
   double-electron capture in He(2+) + He collisions and single-electron
   capture in H(+) + He collisions for the 1.3-12.5 MeV kinetic energy
   range. In all cases, the total cross sections are dominated by forward
   scattering peaks in d sigma/d Omega. The shapes and widths (but not the
   magnitudes) of these peaks are very similar for all energies and for
   capture of one or two electrons corresponding also to our measured
   linear increases in the transverse momentum transfers with increasing
   projectile velocities. These observations may be ascribed to diffraction
   limitations which are connected to electron transfer probabilities P(b)
   which are significant in limited regions of b only. For the H(+) + He
   single-electron capture we observe two additional maxima in the angular
   differential cross sections. We conclude that while the secondary maxima
   at similar to 0.5 mrad probably have large contributions from the Thomas
   proton-electron-nucleus scattering mechanism, the third maxima at
   similar to 0.75 mrad are most likely mainly due to projectile de Broglie
   wave diffraction.}},

   heights at different grafting densities, salt concentrations, and chain
   lengths on a semiquantitative level. At high grafting densities, the
   density profiles obtained with both techniques exhibit a particularly
   close agreement, while at low densities systematic deviations between
   their shapes are observed. The approximation of local electroneutrality,
   which the SCF approach is based on, is studied, and its implications are

Title = {{CRISPR Associated Diversity within a Population of Sulfolobus islandicus}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Predator-prey models for virus-host interactions predict
   that viruses will cause oscillations of microbial host densities due to
   an arms race between resistance and virulence. A new form of microbial
   resistance, CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
   repeats) are a rapidly evolving, sequence-specific immunity mechanism in
   which a short piece of invading viral DNA is inserted into the host's
   chromosome, thereby rendering the host resistant to further infection.
   Few studies have linked this form of resistance to population dynamics
   in natural microbial populations.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined sequence diversity in 39
   strains of the archeaon Sulfolobus islandicus from a single, isolated
   hot spring from Kamchatka, Russia to determine the effects of CRISPR
   immunity on microbial population dynamics. First, multiple housekeeping
   genetic markers identify a large clonal group of identical genotypes
   coexisting with a diverse set of rare genotypes. Second, the
   sequence-specific CRISPR spacer arrays split the large group of isolates
   into two very different groups and reveal extensive diversity and no
   evidence for dominance of a single clone within the population.
   Conclusions/Significance: The evenness of resistance genotypes found
   within this population of S. islandicus is indicative of a lack of
   strain dominance, in contrast to the prediction for a resistant strain
   in a simple predator-prey interaction. Based on evidence for the
   independent acquisition of resistant sequences, we hypothesize that
   CRISPR mediated clonal interference between resistant strains promotes
   and maintains diversity in this natural population.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{133}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the hydrogen-bond network patterns
   involving the NO moieties of five small nitroxides in liquid water by
   analyzing nanosecond scale molecular dynamics trajectories. To this end,
   we implemented two types of hydrogen-bond definitions, based on
   electronic structure, using Bader's atoms-in-molecules analysis and
   based on geometric criteria. In each definition framework, the
   nitroxide/water hydrogen-bond networks appear very variable from a
   nitroxide to another. Moreover, each definition clearly leads to a
   different picture of nitroxide hydration. For instance, the electronic
   structure-based definition predicts a number of hydrogen bonds around
   the nitroxide NO moiety usually larger than geometric structure-based
   ones. One particularly interesting result is that the strength of a
   nitroxide/water hydrogen bond does not depend on its linearity, leading
   us to question the relevance of geometric definition based on angular
   cutoffs to study this type of hydrogen bond. Moreover, none of the
   hydrogen-bond definitions we consider in the present study is able to
   quantitatively correlate the strength of nitroxide/water hydrogen-bond
   networks with the aqueous nitroxide spin properties. This clearly
   exhibits that the hydrogen-bonding concept is not reliable enough to
   draw quantitative conclusions concerning such properties. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic techniques that can be used for genotyping of bacterial
   pathogens ranges from manual, low-cost, agarose gels to high-throughput
   capillary electrophoresis sequencing machines. These two methods are
   currently employed in the electrophoresis of PCR products used in
   multiple locus VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) analysis (MLVA),
   i.e. the agarose electrophoresis (AE) and the capillary electrophoresis
   (CE). Some authors have suggested that clusters generated by AE are less
   reliable than those generated by CE and that the latter is a more
   sensitive technique than the former when typing Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis complex (MTC) isolates. Because such a claim could have
   significant consequences for investigators in this field, a comparison
   was made on 19 Belgian Mycobacterium bovis strains which had previously
   been genotyped using CE VNTR analysis. The VNTR profiles of the CE VNTR
   analysis were compared with those obtained by AE VNTR analysis at 14
   VNTR loci. Our results indicated that there were no differences in copy
   numbers at all loci tested when the copy numbers obtained by the AE VNTR
   analysis were compared with those obtained by CE VNTR analysis. The use
   of AE VNTR analysis in mycobacterial genotyping does not alter the
   sensitivity of the MLVA technique compared with the CE VNTR analysis.
   The AE VNTR can therefore be regarded as a viable alternative in
   moderately equipped laboratories that cannot afford the expensive
   equipment required for CE VNTR analysis and data obtained by AE VNTR
   analysis can be shared between laboratories which use the CE VNTR
   method. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   ia]pentalene (PABTH) in PEO-based polymer electrolyte are studied. It's
   found that there are phenomena of the solution of reduction products in
   the discharging process for Li/PEO-based polymer electrolyte/S-8 cell
   and Li/PEO-based polymer electrolyte/PABTH cell. It suggests that
   ether-based electrolytes even in the form of polymer (such as PEO-based
   Polymer Electrolytes) can't alleviate the loss of active material in
   sulfur electrode for the dissolution of its reduction products. For
   alleviating the solution of reduction production, designing electrolyte
   solvent with a special structure is necessary. Moreover, preliminary
   investigation on discharge capacity of the Li/PEO-based polymer
   electrolyte/S-8 cell and PABTH/PEO20LiTFSI/Li cell show that the
   utilization of the active material is lower than that in liquid
   electrolyte. It due to that sulfur and PABTH isn't ionic conductor, and
   the diffusivity values of Li+ in sulfur and PABTH are very low. PEO
   molecular with a large volume can't penetrate into particle of sulfur
   and PABTH carrying Li+, this is another main reason. From this point of
   view, electrolyte solvent with a small volume is favorable to the

   Subsequent chemisorptive activation of the single-site metallocene
   catalyst {[}rac-ethylene-bisindenyl]zirconium dichloride (EBIZrCl2) on

   Nanocomposite microstructure is analyzed by X-ray diffraction,
   transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   differential scanning calorimetry, atomic force microscopy, and Raman
   spectroscopy. The in situ polymerization process yields homogeneously
   dispersed nanoparticles in a polyolefin matrix. Electrical measurements
   indicate that as the concentration of the filler nanoparticles
   increases, the effective permittivity of the nanocomposites increases,
   affording epsilon values as high as 6.2. The effective permittivites of
   such composites can be predicted by the Maxwell-Garnett formalism using
   the effective medium theory for volume fractions (nu(f)) of
   nanoparticles below 0.06. The nanocomposites have leakage current
   densities of similar to 10(-7)-10(-9) A/cm(2) at an electric field of

   regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene)s (P3HTs) and the characterization of
   the resulting monocarboxylated P3HTs (P3HT-COOHs) carrying one

   three different chain lengths is carried out, and the resulting
   P3HT-COOHs arc characterized with size exclusion chromatography,
   matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization spectroscopy with
   time-of-flight detection mass spectroscopy, and UV-vis spectroscopy. The
   thermal properties and crystallinity in bulk and thin films were studied
   in a comparison between P3HT and P3HT-COOHs. Differential scanning
   calorimetry and wide-angle X-ray scattering support the increasing
   crystallinity for the higher molecular weight samples. Preliminary OFET
   measurements show a good charge carrier mobility in the range of 10(-3)
   cm(2)/(V s) for P3HT-COOHs with molecular weights of 5000 and 10800

Abstract = {{Bluetongue (BT) is a climate change-related emerging infectious disease
   in Europe. Outbreaks of serotypes 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 16 are
   challenging Central and Western Europe since 1998. Measures to control
   or eradicate bluetongue virus (BTV) from Europe have been implemented,
   including movement restrictions and vaccination of domestic
   BTV-susceptible ruminants. However, these measures are difficult to
   apply in wild free-ranging hosts of the virus, like red deer (Cervus
   elaphus), which could play a role in the still unclear epidemiology of
   BT in Europe. We show for the first time that BTV RNA can be detected in
   European red deer blood for long periods, comparable to those of
   domestic ruminants, after experimental infection with BTV-1 and BTV-8.
   BTV RNA was detected in experimentally infected red deer blood up to the
   end of the study (98-112 dpi). BTV-specific antibodies were found in
   serum both by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and virus
   neutralization (VNT) from 8 to 12 dpi to the end of the study, peaking
   at 17-28 dpi. Our results indicate that red deer can be infected with
   BTV and maintain BTV RNA for long periods, remaining essentially
   asymptomatic. Thus, unvaccinated red deer populations have the potential
   to be a BT reservoir in Europe, and could threaten the success of the
   European BTV control strategy. Therefore, wild and farmed red deer
   should be taken into account for BTV surveillance, and movement
   restrictions and vaccination schemes applied to domestic animals should
   be adapted to include farmed or translocated red deer. (c) 2010 Elsevier

   show that the proportion of negatively charged NV(-) defects, with
   respect to its neutral counterpart NV(0), decreases with the size of the
   ND. We then propose a simple model based on a layer of electron traps
   located at the ND surface which is in good agreement with the recorded
   statistics. By using thermal oxidation to remove the shell of amorphous
   carbon around the NDs, we demonstrate a significant increase in the
   proportion of NV(-) defects in 10 nm NDs. These results are invaluable
   for further understanding, control, and use of the unique properties of

Abstract = {{Two low pathogenic (LP) avian influenza virus strains,
   A/mallard/Hungary/19616/07 (H3N8) and A/mute swan/Hungary/5973/07
   (H7N7), isolated as part of the National Surveillance Program in
   Hungary, were fully sequenced and characterized. The two viruses showed
   the closest phylogenetic relationship regarding their acidic polymerase
   genes. The H7N7 Hungarian virus and some H5N2 influenza viruses isolated
   from Korean pigs appeared to have their basic polymerase gene 1 from a
   relatively recent common ancestor. The matrix gene nucleotide sequence
   of each Hungarian virus showed close relationship with contemporaneous
   Czech H3N8 mallard isolates, which belonged to distinct phylogenetic
   branches. The non-structural protein genes belonged to different
   alleles, rendering a peculiar characteristic to the H7N7 isolate
   compared to the so far analyzed Eurasian H7 viruses. The surface
   glycoprotein genes of the H3N8 isolate showed a close phylogenetic
   relationship and high nucleotide identities to H3N8 subtype isolates
   from Northern Europe collected in 2003-2006, and to an H3N2 isolate in
   Italy in 2006, extending the perceptions of this HA subtype across
   Northern and Southern Europe close to this period. These findings
   provide further data to the diversity of influenza viruses found in wild
   migratory birds and present useful information for large scale studies
   on influenza virus evolution. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the association of
   different levels of occupational, commuting, and leisure-time physical
   activity and heart failure (HF) risk.
   Background The role of different types of physical activity in
   explaining the risk of HF is not properly established.
   Methods Study cohorts included 28,334 Finnish men and 29,874 women who
   were 25 to 74 years of age and free of HF at baseline. Baseline
   measurement of different types of physical activity was used to predict
   incident HF.
   Results During a mean follow-up of 18.4 years, HF developed in 1,868 men
   and 1,640 women. The multivariate adjusted (age; smoking; education;
   alcohol consumption; body mass index; systolic blood pressure; total
   cholesterol; history of myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease,
   diabetes, lung disease, and use of antihypertensive drugs; and other
   types of physical activity) hazard ratios of HF associated with light,
   moderate, and active occupational activity were 1.00, 0.90, and 0.83 (p
   = 0.005, for trend) for men and 1.00, 0.80, and 0.92 (p = 0.007, for
   trend) for women, respectively. The multivariate adjusted hazard ratios
   of HF associated with low, moderate, and high leisure-time physical
   activity were 1.00, 0.83, and 0.65 (p < 0.001, for trend) for men and
   1.00, 0.84, and 0.75 (p < 0.001, for trend) for women, respectively.
   Active commuting had a significant inverse association with HF risk in
   women, but not in men, before adjustment for occupational and
   leisure-time physical activity. The joint effects of any 2 types of
   physical activity on HF risk were even greater.
   Conclusions Moderate and high levels of occupational or leisure-time
   physical activity are associated with a reduced risk of HF. (J Am Coll

Title = {{The Adaptive Function of Masturbation in a Promiscuous African Ground
   Squirrel}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Studies of animal mating systems increasingly emphasize
   female multiple mating and cryptic sexual selection, particularly sperm
   competition. Males under intense sperm competition may manipulate sperm
   quantity and quality through masturbation, which could waste sperm and
   decrease fertility. I examined the factors influencing masturbation by
   male Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) in light of a number of
   functional hypotheses.
   Methodology: Observational data on a marked population of squirrels were
   collected in east-central Namibia using scan and all-occurrences
   sampling.
   Findings: Masturbation was far more frequent on days of female oestrus
   and mostly occurred after copulation. Masturbation rates were higher in
   dominant males, which copulate more, than in subordinates and increased
   with number of mates a female accepts.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that masturbation in this species was
   not a response to sperm competition nor a sexual outlet by subordinates
   that did not copulate. Instead masturbation could function as a form of
   genital grooming. Female Cape ground squirrels mate with up to 10 males
   in a 3-hr oestrus, and by masturbating after copulation males could
   reduce the chance of infection. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
   can profoundly affect fertility, and their consequences for mating
   strategies need to be examined more fully.}},

Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: High-throughput technologies have led to a new era of
   proteomics. Although protein microarray experiments are becoming more
   common place there are a variety of experimental and statistical issues
   that have yet to be addressed, and that will carry over to new
   high-throughput technologies unless they are investigated. One of the
   largest of these challenges is the selection of functionally consistent
   proteins.
   Results: We present a novel semi-nonparametric mixture model for
   classifying proteins as consistent or inconsistent while controlling the
   false discovery rate and the false non-discovery rate. The performance
   of the proposed approach is compared to current methods via simulation
   under a variety of experimental conditions.
   Conclusions: We provide a statistical method for selecting functionally
   consistent proteins in the context of protein microarray experiments,
   but the proposed semi-nonparametric mixture model method can certainly
   be generalized to solve other mixture data problems. The main advantage
   of this approach is that it provides the posterior probability of
   consistency for each protein.}},

Abstract = {{The dielectric properties of two electrorheological liquid (ERL)
   systems, NaA zeolite/silicone oil and NaA zeolite/coal oil, were
   measured by dielectric spectroscopy, and an obvious dielectric
   relaxation at about 10(5) Hz can be observed in each of systems. The
   single relaxation Cole-Cole equation was used to fit the dielectric
   parameters of the systems, and the results indicated that NaA
   zeolite/silicone oil possessed larger dielectric increment (Delta
   epsilon). Furthermore, for both of the two systems, the relationship
   between the volume fraction (phi) and dielectric increment obeyed the
   linear function Delta epsilon=4 epsilon(m)phi (epsilon(m), the
   permittivity of oil medium). By means of calculating and analyzing the
   dielectric mismatch parameter between zeolite particle and oil medium,
   the contribution of epsilon(m) to the interface polarization intensity
   of ERL was clarified. Moreover, the effect of adsorbed water on the
   interface polarization of zeolite ERL was researched as well. The
   results indicated that the permittivity of zeolite particle was enhanced
   and the relaxation time was reduced in the presence of adsorbed water,
   however, no change was found in Delta epsilon of zeolite ERL with
   adsorbed water. Based on the dielectric mismatch theory, the adsorbed
   water was proved to be positive to the interface polarization rate of
   zeolite ERL.}},

   probed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Mn 3d valence states and elementary electronic excitations in
   single-crystalline TbMnO3 were probed with resonant inelastic x-ray
   scattering (RIXS) (or resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy, RXES),
   polarized x-ray absorption spectra and ab initio electron-structure
   calculations. Polarized Mn K-edge x-ray absorption spectra of TbMnO3
   crystals exhibit a significant anisotropy along three crystallographic
   directions, particularly for the white-line region. The 1s3p-RXES
   spectra obtained at the Mn K edge reveal that the quadrupolar Raman
   regime is restricted predominantly to below the pre-edge peak whereas
   the fluorescence regime starts from the first pre-edge peak of 1s -> 3d
   transitions, indicating a relatively delocalized character of unoccupied
   Mn 3d states. The additional K beta emission profile at energy loss
   similar to 62 eV is attributed to the off-site dipole Mn 1s-Mn' 3d
   and/or Mn 1s-Tb 5d transitions, originating from hybridization between
   Mn 4p states and neighboring Mn' 3d/Tb 5d states. The off-site dipole
   transition makes a considerable contribution to the pre-edge region of
   Mn K-edge spectrum. Three prominent RIXS features at similar to 2.9, 7,
   and 11 eV were observed. Based on GGA+U calculations, the 7 eV region
   corresponds to transitions from O 2p states to unoccupied minority Mn 3d
   states, whereas the 11 eV band is ascribed to transitions from the O 2p
   band to the empty Tb 5d band. The broad 2.9 eV band is attributed to the
   coexistence of on-site Mn 3d-Mn 3d and off-site Mn 3d-Mn' 3d
   transitions.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{It has previously been reported that x-rays are emitted when adhesive
   tape is peeled in a vacuum but no account of the dependence of the x-ray
   emission on the pressure of the environment has been given to date. In
   this paper we present detailed experimental data on the number and
   angular distribution of x-ray photons as a function of pressure. We find
   that x-rays are emitted for pressures between p(0) = 10(-3) and p(1) =
   10(-2) mBar, with similar to 10(6) counts/(cm(2)s) recorded by a 256 x
   256 pixel(2) silicon array sensor placed 35 mm from the tape. The main
   role of the tape is found to be the build-up of an acceleration
   potential sufficient to produce x-rays by bremsstrahlung of free
   electrons in a low-pressure gas. The source of the free electrons is the
   gas. Our model shows that the production rate of uncompensated tape
   charge and absorption of positive ions from the gas define p(1). The
   angular distribution of the radiation shows a pressure-independent 20
   degrees wide peak in the direction perpendicular to electron motion.
   Ordinary bremsstrahlung cannot describe this peak. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Resonance modes in single crystal sapphire (alpha-Al(2)O(3)) exhibit
   extremely high electrical and mechanical Q factors (approximate to 109

   experiments at the quantum limit. We report the cool down of a bulk
   sapphire sample below superfluid liquid-helium temperature (1.6 K) to as
   low as 25 mK. The electromagnetic properties were characterized at
   microwave frequencies, and we report the observation of
   electromagnetically induced thermal bistability in whispering gallery
   modes due to the material T(3) dependence on thermal conductivity and
   the ultralow dielectric loss tangent. We identify ``magic
   temperatures{''} between 80 and 2100 mK, the lowest ever measured, at
   which the onset of bistability is suppressed and the
   frequency-temperature dependence is annulled. These phenomena at low
   temperatures make sapphire suitable for quantum metrology and
   ultrastable clock applications, including the possible realization of
   the quantum-limited sapphire clock.}},

Abstract = {{The proximity effects of high voltage electric power transmission lines
   on Leyland Cypress (xCupressocyparis leylandii (Dallim. and A. B.
   Jacks.) Dallim) and Japanese Privet (Ligustrum japonicum Thunb.) growth
   were examined in a private nursery located in Sakarya, Turkey. Five
   transect were randomly chosen in both leylandii and privet lots in the
   nursery. In the summer of 2009, starting from under the power line 12
   sampling point for every five meters away from the power line on each
   transaction was located. From these sampling points, five seedlings for
   each species were randomly chosen. From each sampling seedlings, five -
   seven leaves (for private) or spurs (for leylandii) were collected from
   lower-, middle- and upper-crown. For each sampling seedling diameter at
   breast height (dbh) were measured with a caliper. Within the laboratory,
   the projected surface area (SLA) of needles and leaves were determined
   using a leaf area meter. The relationship among measured seedling
   variables and the proximity to high voltage electric power transmission
   lines were evaluated using correlation. The effects of proximity to
   power-line on specific leaf area and seedling dbh were tested with an
   analysis of variance procedure (ANOVA). Tukey's HSD test with alpha =
   0.05 was performed to compare means. The result of the data revealed
   that the mean of seedling dbh at 55 m away from the power line was about
   25\% smaller than that of the seedlings underneath the power line. The
   data also showed that there was a gradual decrease at dbh value of the
   privet with the distance from the power line. Seedling mean dbh value at
   the 25(th) m sampling point was about 10\% lower than that of the
   seedlings underneath the power line. At the 40(th) m sampling point this
   dbh value was about 17 and 8\% lower than those of the seedlings
   underneath the power line and of the seedling at 25(th) m sampling
   point, respectively. Specific leaf area after the 30(th) m away from the
   power line has been decreasing. The SLA value at the 30(th) m is about
   17\% lower than that of the seedling underneath the power line.}},

   ``effective Einstein equations{''} including all order un-gravity
   effects. An unexpected ``bonus{''} of accounting un-gravity effects is
   the fractalisation of the event horizon. In the un-gravity dominated
   regime the event horizon thermodynamically behaves as fractal surface of

Title = {{Propagation dynamics on networks featuring complex topologies}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3, 2}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Analytical description of propagation phenomena on random networks has
   flourished in recent years, yet more complex systems have mainly been
   studied through numerical means. In this paper, a mean-field description
   is used to coherently couple the dynamics of the network elements (such
   as nodes, vertices, individuals, etc.) on the one hand and their
   recurrent topological patterns (such as subgraphs, groups, etc.) on the
   other hand. In a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model of
   epidemic spread on social networks with community structure, this
   approach yields a set of ordinary differential equations for the time
   evolution of the system, as well as analytical solutions for the
   epidemic threshold and equilibria. The results obtained are in good
   agreement with numerical simulations and reproduce the behavior of
   random networks in the appropriate limits which highlights the influence
   of topology on the processes. Finally, it is demonstrated that our model
   predicts higher epidemic thresholds for clustered structures than for
   equivalent random topologies in the case of networks with zero degree
   correlation.}},

Abstract = {{The role of lymphangiogenesis in inflammation has remained unclear. To
   investigate the role of lymphatic versus blood vasculature in chronic
   skin inflammation, we inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR) signaling by function-blocking antibodies in the
   established keratin 14 (K14)-VEGF-A transgenic (Tg) mouse model of
   chronic cutaneous inflammation. Although treatment with an anti-VEGFR-2
   antibody inhibited skin inflammation, epidermal hyperplasia,
   inflammatory infiltration, and angiogenesis, systemic inhibition of
   VEGFR-3, surprisingly, increased inflammatory edema formation and
   inflammatory cell accumulation despite inhibition of lymphangiogenesis.
   Importantly, chronic Tg delivery of the lymphangiogenic factor VEGF-C to
   the skin of K14-VEGF-A mice completely inhibited development of chronic
   skin inflammation, epidermal hyperplasia and abnormal differentiation,
   and accumulation of CD8 T cells. Similar results were found after Tg
   delivery of mouse VEGF-D that only activates VEGFR-3 but not VEGFR-2.
   Moreover, intracutaneous injection of recombinant VEGF-C156S, which only
   activates VEGFR-3, significantly reduced inflammation. Although
   lymphatic drainage was inhibited in chronic skin inflammation, it was
   enhanced by Tg VEGF-C delivery. Together, these results reveal an
   unanticipated active role of lymphatic vessels in controlling chronic
   inflammation. Stimulation of functional lymphangiogenesis via VEGFR-3,
   in addition to antiangiogenic therapy, might therefore serve as a novel
   strategy to treat chronic inflammatory disorders of the skin and
   possibly also other organs.}},

Title = {{Toward a first-principle derivation of confinement and
   chiral-symmetry-breaking crossover transitions in QCD}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{We give a theoretical framework to obtain a low-energy effective theory
   of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) towards a first-principle derivation of
   confinement/deconfinement and chiral-symmetry breaking/restoration
   crossover transitions. In fact, we demonstrate that an effective theory
   obtained using simple but nontrivial approximations within this
   framework enables us to treat both transitions simultaneously on equal
   footing. A resulting effective theory is regarded as a modified and
   improved version of nonlocal Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
   (nonlocal PNJL) models proposed recently by Hell, Rossner,
   Cristoforetti, and Weise, and Sasaki, Friman, and Redlich, extending the
   original (local) PNJL model by Fukushima and others. A novel feature is
   that the nonlocal NJL coupling depends explicitly on the temperature and
   Polyakov loop, which affects the entanglement between confinement and
   chiral-symmetry breaking, together with the cross term introduced
   through the covariant derivative in the quark sector considered in the
   conventional PNJL model. The chiral-symmetry breaking/restoration
   transition is controlled by the nonlocal NJL interaction, while the
   confinement/deconfinement transition in the pure gluon sector is
   specified by the nonperturbative effective potential for the Polyakov
   loop obtained recently by Braun, Gies, Marhauser, and Pawlowski. The
   basic ingredients are a reformulation of QCD based on new variables and
   the flow equation of the Wetterich type in the Wilsonian renormalization
   group. This framework can be applied to investigate the QCD phase
   diagram at finite temperature and density.}},

Title = {{Efficacy of a brief multifactorial adherence-based intervention on
   reducing the blood pressure of patients with poor adherence: protocol
   for a randomized clinical trial}},
Journal = {{BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Lowering of blood pressure by antihypertensive drugs reduces
   the risks of cardiovascular events, stroke, and total mortality.
   However, poor adherence to antihypertensive medications reduces their
   effectiveness and increases the risk of adverse events. In terms of
   relative risk reduction, an improvement in medication adherence could be
   as effective as the development of a new drug.
   Methods/Design: The proposed randomized controlled trial will include
   patients with a low adherence to medication and uncontrolled blood
   pressure. The intervention group will receive a multifactorial
   intervention during the first, third, and ninth months, to improve
   adherence. This intervention will include motivational interviews, pill
   reminders, family support, blood pressure self-recording, and
   simplification of the dosing regimen.
   Measurement: The primary outcome is systolic blood pressure. The
   secondary outcomes are diastolic blood pressure, proportion of patients
   with adequately controlled blood pressure, and total cost.
   Discussion: The trial will evaluate the impact of a multifactorial
   adherence intervention in routine clinical practice. Ethical approval
   was given by the Ethical Committee on Human Research of Balearic
   islands, Spain (approval number IB 969/08 PI).}},

Abstract = {{The impact of the inherent optical properties (IOP) variability on the
   chlorophyll, Chl, retrieval from ocean color remote sensing algorithms
   is analyzed from an in situ data set covering a large dynamic range. The
   effect of the variability of the specific phytoplankton absorption
   coefficient, a(phy)/Chl, specific particulate backscattering
   coefficient, b(bp)/Chl, and colored detrital matter absorption to
   non-water absorption ratio, a(cdm)/a(nw), on the performance of standard
   operational algorithms is examined. This study confirms that empirical
   algorithms are highly dependent on the specifics IOP values (especially
   b(bp)/Chl and a(cdm)/a(nw)): Chl is over-estimated in waters with
   specific IOP values higher than averaged values, and vice versa. These
   results clearly indicate the necessity to account for the influence of
   the specific IOP variability in Chl retrieval algorithms. (C) 2010

   Transplant Recipients}},

Abstract = {{Background. The increased incidence of skin cancers in solid organ
   transplant recipients (OTR) has been well established. However, our
   understanding of the potential aggressive behavior of these cancers has
   been largely based on the findings of multiple different studies
   analyzing isolated indicators of aggressive behavior. The purpose of
   this study was to determine the aggressiveness of nonmelanotic skin
   cancers in a large transplant population compared with an
   immunocompetent control population with similar cancers.
   Methods. Immunosuppressed transplanted patients and an immunocompetent
   control group matched in size with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or
   basal cell carcinoma (BCC) were evaluated for the factors of
   aggressiveness. A retrospective chart review was performed. Data
   obtained included transplant type, number of cancers, local recurrence
   rate, lymph node involvement, lymphatic invasion, perineural invasion,
   deep spread, subsequent treatment with radiation or chemotherapy, and
   death from disease.
   Results. Three hundred seven patients had SCC (OTR: 153, control: 154),
   and 246 patients had BCC (OTR: 123, control: 123). SCC in OTR was
   significantly more likely to have an increased number of primary tumors,
   deep tissue spread, perineural and lymphatic invasion, recurrence, and
   need for radiation or chemotherapy. BCC in OTR was not associated with
   more aggressive disease when compared with controls with BCC.
   Conclusions. SCC in OTR behaves significantly more aggressively than in
   immunocompetent patients. BCC in the OTR population does not seem to act
   more aggressively.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a fully optical, long-distance remote comparison of
   independent ultrastable optical frequencies reaching a short term
   stability that is superior to any reported remote comparison of optical

   long phase-stabilized fiber in a commercial telecommunication network.
   The remote characterization spans more than one optical octave and
   reaches a fractional frequency instability between the independent
   ultrastable laser systems of 3x10(-15) in 0.1 s. The achieved
   performance at 100 ms represents an improvement by one order of
   magnitude to any previously reported remote comparison of optical

Abstract = {{Carvacrol, a monoterpenic phenol present in essential oils of the
   Labiatae family, has been used through the ages as a source of flavor in
   food and for medicinal purposes. Borneol is a monoterpene found in
   several species of Artemisia and Dipterocarpaceae, used for anxiety,
   pain and anesthesia in traditional Chinese. Citral, a mixture of two
   geometrical isomers (neral and geranial), is one of the most important
   compounds in some citrus oils and has central nervous system (CNS)
   properties. The anticonvulsant effect of carvacrol (CARV), (-)-borneol
   (BOR) and citral (CIT) was investigated in two animal models of
   epilepsy. Mice were pretreated with CARV, BOR or CIT (50, 100, and 200
   mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) or maximal
   electroshock (MES) tests, the two most important animal epilepsy tests.
   The latency for development of convulsions and protection percentage was
   recorded. In order to investigate the involvement of GABAergic system,
   flumazenil was utilized. These monoterpenes, CARV in a higher, but not
   in a lower dose (p < 0.001), BOR and CIT in all doses (p < 0.05 or p <
   0.001), were capable of promoting an increase of latency for the
   development of convulsions induced by PTZ. Additionally, these compounds
   were efficient in preventing the tonic convulsions (p < 0.05) induced by
   MES. However, the GABAergic neurotransmitter system might be involved,
   at least in BOR effects. Henceforth, our results suggest that CARV, BOR
   and CIT possess anticonvulsant activity effect against PTZ-induced
   convulsions and MES.}},

   Salt-Sensitive Hypertension in Indigenous Southern Africans}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Multiple factors underlie susceptibility to essential hypertension,
   including a significant genetic and ethnic component, and environmental
   effects. Blood pressure response of hypertensive individuals to salt is
   heterogeneous, but salt sensitivity appears more prevalent in people of
   indigenous African origin. The underlying genetics of salt-sensitive
   hypertension, however, are poorly understood. In this study,
   computational methods including text-and data-mining have been used to
   select and prioritize candidate aetiological genes for salt-sensitive
   hypertension. Additionally, we have compared allele frequencies and copy
   number variation for single nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes
   between indigenous Southern African and Caucasian populations, with the
   aim of identifying candidate genes with significant variability between
   the population groups: identifying genetic variability between
   population groups can exploit ethnic differences in disease prevalence
   to aid with prioritisation of good candidate genes. Our top-ranking
   candidate genes include parathyroid hormone precursor (PTH) and
   type-1angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1). We propose that the candidate
   genes identified in this study warrant further investigation as
   potential aetiological genes for salt-sensitive hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{Coupling e(-)-h(+) and gas phase plasmas with a strong electric field
   across a potential barrier yields a transistor providing
   photosensitivity and voltage gain but also a light-emitting collector
   whose radiative output can be switched and modulated. This
   optoelectronic device relies on the correspondence between the
   properties of a low temperature, nonequilibrium plasma and those for the
   e(-)-h(+) plasma in an n-type semiconductor. Hysteresis observed in the
   collector current-base current characteristics is attributed primarily
   to charge stored in the base, and the photogeneration of e(-)-h(+) pairs
   at the base-collector junction. Extinguishing the collector plasma
   requires an emitter-base junction reverse bias of <1 V. (C) 2010

Title = {{Erosion and mobility in granular collapse over sloping beds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{We describe laboratory experiments of granular material flowing over an
   inclined plane covered by an erodible bed, designed to mimic erosion
   processes of natural flows travelling over deposits built up by earlier
   events. Two controlling parameters are the inclination of the plane and
   the thickness of the erodible layer. We show that erosion processes can
   increase the flow mobility (i.e., runout) over slopes with inclination
   close to the repose angle of the grains theta(r) by up to 40\%, even for
   very thin erodible beds. Erosion efficiency is shown to strongly depend
   on the slope of the topography. Entrainment begins to affect the flow at
   inclination angles exceeding a critical angle theta(c) similar or equal
   to theta(r)/2. Runout distance increases almost linearly as a function
   of the thickness of the erodible bed, suggesting that erosion is mainly
   supply-dependent. Two regimes are observed during granular collapse: a
   first spreading phase with high velocity followed by a slow thin flow,
   provided either the slope or the thickness of the erodible bed is high
   enough. Surprisingly, erosion affects the flow mostly during the
   deceleration phase and the slow regime. The avalanche excavates the
   erodible layer immediately at the flow front. Waves are observed behind
   the front that help to remove grains from the erodible bed. Steep
   frontal surges are seen at high inclination angles over both rigid or
   erodible bed. Finally, simple scaling laws are proposed making it
   possible to obtain a first estimate of the deposit and emplacement time
   of a granular collapse over a rigid or erodible inclined bed.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{We discuss the effect of O+ ions on substorm onsets by examining the
   relation between the substorm onset location and the distribution of the
   O+/H+ number density ratio before the onset in the various regions
   within the plasma sheet (-8 R-E > X-GSM > -32 R-E). We use 9-212 keV/e
   ion flux data observed by Geotail/Energetic Particles and Ion
   Composition (EPIC)/Suprathermal Ion Composition Spectrometer (STICS)
   instrument and the IMAGE/Far Ultra-Violet (FUV) substorm onset list
   presented by Frey et al. {[} Frey, H. U., S. B. Mende, V. Angelopoulos,
   and E. F. Donovan (2004), Substorm onset observations by IMAGE-FUV, J.
   Geophys. Res., 109, A10304, doi:10.1029/2004JA010607]. The results are
   summarized as follows. Substorm onsets, which we identify by auroral
   initial brightenings, are likely to occur in the more dusk-(dawn-)ward
   region when the O+/H+ number density ratio is high in the dusk (dawn)
   side. This property is observed only in the near-Earth plasma sheet (at
   -8 R-E > X-GSM > -14 R-E). The above-mentioned property holds in each of
   two groups: substorm events due to internal instability of the
   magnetosphere (i.e., internally triggered substorms) and events due to
   external changes in the solar wind or the interplanetary magnetic field
   (i.e., externally triggered substorms). Thus, we conclude that the
   substorm onset location depends on the density of O+ ions in the
   near-Earth plasma sheet prior to onset, whether the substorm is
   triggered internally or externally.}},

Abstract = {{The plant expression vector of choleratoxin B subunit(CTB)-human
   insulin(BA) fusion protein pBI121/(CTB-BA) was constructed first and
   then the Gynostemma Pentapyhllum Makino callus cell line that could
   express CTB-human insulin fusion protein was constructed and its
   hypoglycemic effect was evaluated in mice. The plant expression vector
   pBI121/(CTB-BA) was digested with both BamI and SacI. Agrobacterium
   tumerfaciens strain LBA4404 was transformed with previously constructed
   recombinant plasmid pBI121/(CTB-BA) via the freeze thawing method, then
   CTB-BA gene was integrated to G Pentapyhllum Makino callus cells by
   co-culturing the cells with the transformed LBA4404 strain. The
   transformed G Pentapyhllum Makino callus cells were identified by DNA
   sequence assey and RT-PCR. The expressed product was identified by
   western-blot and its amount was tested by HASA kit and its blood sugar
   decreasing effect was tested in mice. The sequences of synthetic CTB and
   human insulin genes(BA) were completely identical to those designed.
   Restriction map proved that the length of gene fragment inserted into
   expression vector pBI121 was consistent with that expected. The sequence
   of genomic DNA of expressed product was completely identical to that
   designed. The result of RT-PCR was consistent with that expected. The
   expressed product showed a specific band with a relative molecular mass
   of 17000 by Western-blot. The human insulin expression amount was 6.03
   mu IU/mL according to the ELISA result. The animal test showed that only
   the G Pentapyhllum Makino callus cell line itself showed activity in
   decreasing the blood sugar of mice, however, the activity of the
   transformed G Pentapyhllum Makino callus cells was much higher. The
   plant expression vector pBI121/(CTB-BA) was constructed and expressed in
   the G Pentapyhllum Makino callus cells successfully for the first time.
   The transformed G Pentapyhllum Makino callus cells showed high activity
   in decreasing the blood sugar of mice. This study developed a new way
   for the development of oral administration insulin.}},

Abstract = {{The low and high temperature creep properties of the (alpha+beta
   titanium alloy Ti834 have been studied for various levels of applied
   plastic prestrain. Evidence is shown that the prestrain at room
   temperature causes the formation of quasi-cleavage facets in a manner
   described by the Evans-Bache model. These facets are also produced when
   the material is creep tested at room temperature, although larger areas
   of faceting are found. The applied prestrain causes a drop in the strain
   at failure at room temperature due to a high dislocation density
   inhibiting further movement of dislocations. At high temperature this
   increase in applied prestrain results in an accelerated creep rate. This
   is attributed to a number of issues, including increased thermal energy
   allowing greater dislocation recovery and mobility. Swaged Ti834
   material is also considered and is shown to behave similar to highly
   prestrained material with evidence of strain hardening and reduced cold
   creep rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{HIV Spending as a Share of Total Health Expenditure: An Analysis of
   Regional Variation in a Multi-Country Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: HIV has devastated numerous countries in sub-Saharan Africa
   and is a dominant health force in many other parts of the world. Its
   undeniable importance is reflected in the establishment of Millennium
   Development Goal No. 6. Unprecedented amounts of funding have been
   committed and disbursed over the past two decades. Many have argued that
   this enormous influx of funding has been detrimental to building
   stronger health systems in recipient countries. This paper examines the
   funding share for HIV measured against the total funding for health.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A descriptive analysis of HIV and health
   expenditures in 2007 from 65 countries was conducted. Comparable data
   from individual countries was used by applying a consistent definition
   for HIV expenditures and total health expenditures from NHAs to align
   them with National AIDS Assessment Reports. In 2007, the total public
   and international expenditure in LMICs for HIV was 1.6 percent of the
   total spending on health, while the share in SSA was 19.4 percent. HIV
   prevalence was six-fold higher in SSA than the next highest region and
   it is the only region whose share of HIV spending exceeded the burden of
   HIV DALYs.
   Conclusions/Significance: The share of HIV spending across the 65
   countries was quite moderate considering that the estimated share of
   deaths attributable to HIV stood at 3.8 percent and DALYs at 4.4
   percent. Several high spending countries are using a large share of
   their total health spending for HIV health, but these countries are the
   exception rather than representative of the average SSA country. There
   is wide variation between regions, but the burden of disease also varies
   significantly. The percentage of HIV spending is a useful indicator for
   better understanding health care resources and their allocation
   patterns.}},

Title = {{Effect of the heterogeneity of metamaterials on the Casimir-Lifshitz
   interaction}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{The Casimir-Lifshitz interaction between metamaterials is studied using
   a model that takes into account the structural heterogeneity of the
   dielectric and magnetic properties of the bodies. A recently developed
   perturbation theory for the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction between
   arbitrary material bodies is generalized to include nonuniform magnetic
   permeability profiles and used to study the interaction between the
   magneto-dielectric heterostructures within the leading order. The
   metamaterials are modeled as two-dimensional arrays of domains with
   varying permittivity and permeability. In the case of two semi-infinite
   bodies with flat boundaries, the patterned structure of the material
   properties is found to cause the normal Casimir-Lifshitz force to
   develop an oscillatory behavior when the distance between the two bodies
   is comparable to the wavelength of the patterned features in the
   metamaterials. The nonuniformity also leads to the emergence of lateral
   Casimir-Lifshitz forces, which tend to strengthen as the gap size
   becomes smaller. Our results suggest that the recent studies on
   Casimir-Lifshitz forces between metamaterials, which have been performed
   with the aim of examining the possibility of observing the repulsive
   force, should be revisited to include the effect of the patterned
   structure at the wavelength of several hundred nanometers that coincides
   with the relevant gap size in the experiments.}},

   Co- and Ni-substituted manganites}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{High-precision ac susceptibility data have been taken on the
   La0.7Pb0.3Mn1-y(Co, Ni)(y)O-3 (y = 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3) manganite system
   over a wide range of amplitudes and frequencies of the ac driving field
   in a temperature range that embraces the critical region near the
   ferromagnetic (FM)-paramagnetic (PM) phase transition (occurring at the
   Curie point T-C). Elaborate data analysis was performed that (i) enabled
   the first observation of a crossover from a three-dimensional (3D; d =
   3) isotropic long-range dipolar asymptotic critical behavior to a d = 3
   isotropic short-range Heisenberg critical regime as the temperature is
   raised from T-C in the compositions y 6 = 0 (no such crossover is
   observed in the parent compound, y = 0) and (ii) brought out clearly the
   importance of dipole-dipole interactions between the e(g) electron spins
   and/or between e(g)-t(2g) electron spins in establishing long-range FM
   order in the insulating state. The final charge and spin states of Co
   and Ni ions, substituting for the Mn3+ and/or Mn4+ ions, are arrived at
   by using a scenario of substitution that is consistent not only with the
   present results but also with the previously published structural,
   thermo-gravimetric, bulk magnetization, dc magnetic susceptibility and
   electrical resistivity data on the same system. The marked similarity
   seen between the magnetic behavior of the manganite system in question
   and the quenched random-exchange ferromagnets, within and outside the
   critical region, suggests that the percolation model forms an adequate
   description of the FM metal-to-PM insulator transition.}},

Abstract = {{We examine stochastic computer simulations of the Leibler-Ohta-Kawasaki
   (LOK) phase-field model({[}1,2]) and demonstrate that long-wavelength
   line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) in a lamellar
   diblock copolymer resist depend monotonically on quench depth and noise
   strength, and that the LER and LWR spectra both exhibit a peak at
   k(0)-the characteristic wave-number of mesophase separation in diblock
   copolymers. For k less than or similar to k(0), we find that the LER
   spectrum approximately scales like k(-1.6). These observations are
   consistent with previous theoretical, computational, and experimental
   examinations LER and LWR in diblock copolymer melts, and thus the LOK
   phase-field model should be considered a capable and appropriate
   framework for future examination of long-wavelength LER and LWR in block
   copolymer resist systems.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1353}},
Pages = {{187-193}},

Abstract = {{Activation of the trkA pathway has been widely accepted as a crucial
   factor for neuronal survival during cerebral ischemia. Findings from
   earlier studies have suggested that exercise changed neurotrophic
   factors and trk family in an ischemic rat model. In this study, we
   investigated the question of whether or not treadmill exercise improves
   motor function in an ischemic rat model, and whether or not the result
   is associated with trkA, responding to NGF. Adult male Sprague-Dawley
   rats underwent surgery for permanent ischemia, followed by either 12
   days of treadmill exercise or non-exercise. We found that exercise
   increased the level of trkA and NGF proteins in the contralateral
   hemisphere and improved the motor behavior index. Our data indicate that
   treadmill exercise ameliorates motor performance via the elevation of
   trkA and NGF proteins in the contralateral hemisphere after permanent
   brain ischemia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We calculate both the micromechanical response and bulk elastic

   results for both low and high density. These results may help to explain

Abstract = {{Background: Early integration of HIV proviral DNA into the host cell
   genome prevents viral eradication, despite suppressive HAART. In vitro,
   integrase inhibitors reduce proviral DNA levels and rapidly increase
   2-long-terminal repeat (LTR) circle levels. We examined the effect of
   raltegravir on the time course of HIV-1 DNA forms in patients with
   controlled viremia.
   Patients and methods: The EASIER-ANRS 138 randomized trial demonstrated
   that switching from enfuvirtide to raltegravir maintained virological
   suppression in treatment-experienced patients with viral load below 400
   copies/ml. We analyzed total HIV-1 DNA and 2-LTR circle levels measured
   at weeks (W) 0 and 24 in the first 30 patients enrolled in each arm, and
   at W48 in the raltegravir arm.
   Results: At W0 the total DNA level was 3.6 log(10)/10(6) peripheral
   blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) in both groups, and 2-LTR circles were
   detected in six patients (median 89 copies/10(6) PBMC). At W24 the total
   DNA level was 3.6 log(10)/10(6) PBMC in both groups, and 2-LTR circles
   were detected in three new patients. At W48 the total HIV DNA level in
   the raltegravir group was 3.5 log(10)/10(6) PBMC, and 2-LTR circles were
   undetectable. No significant change in total HIV DNA occurred between W0
   and W24 in either arm (P = 0.71) and no significant change was observed
   in the raltegravir arm at W48.
   Discussion: In most patients on effective HAART, including regimens
   containing an integrase inhibitor, the viral reservoir, reflected by the
   HIV-1 DNA load, is stable and nondynamic during the 48 weeks of
   follow-up. (C) 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott

Abstract = {{Attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy was applied
   to investigate the structural change in dissolved glycine
   (H(3)(+)-N-CH(2)-COO(-)) with rising temperature from 27 to 150 degrees
   C The spectra were recorded using a heatable ATR-IR system, which was
   developed by Masuda et al. {[}1] This apparatus allows us to obtain the
   IR spectrum of aqueous solution at temperatures of up to 200 degrees C
   and under pressures of up to 30 MPa. Spectral analysis revealed the
   following changes in the covalent bond strength of glycine with rising
   temperature: (1) the N-H bonds of NH(3)(+) group became stronger, (2)
   the structure of COO(-) group became asymmetric owing to the
   strengthening of the electrostatic interaction between the NH(3)(+)
   group and COO(-) group, (3) the strengths of C-C bond and C-N bond
   became weaker These changes can be mainly attributed to the weakening of
   the hydrogen bond interaction between glycine and water molecules. The
   relationship between the structural change and the change in
   decomposition behavior of glycine with rising temperature was then
   evaluated It was interpreted that the decarboxylation and the
   deamination were caused by the weakening of C-C bond and C-N bond as
   well as the strengthening of NH(3)(+)COO(-) interaction with rising
   temperature (C) 2010 Elsevier B V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We synthesized and investigated the effect of formyl peptide receptor 2
   (FPR2)-derived pepducins in human monocytes. The FPR2-based
   cell-penetrating lipopeptide, ``pepducin{''} (F2pal-16), stimulated
   intracellular calcium increase in human monocytes via pertussis toxin
   (PTX)-sensitive G-protein and phospholipase C (PLC) activity. From a
   functional aspect, we showed that F2pal-16 stimulated monocyte
   chemotaxis. F2pal-16 also stimulated the generation of superoxide anion
   in human monocytes. Moreover, F2pal-16 dramatically increased the
   production of several kinds of pro-inflammatory cytokines (CXCL8, CCL2,
   IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha) in human monocytes via NF-kappa B activation.
   Since FPR2 plays an important role in immune responses, F2pal-16 can
   serve as a useful reagent for the study of FPR2-mediated immune
   modulation. (c) 2010 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Title = {{Dynamic formation of extreme ozone minimum events over the Tibetan
   Plateau during northern winters 1987-2001}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},

Abstract = {{Wintertime extreme ozone minima in the total column ozone over the
   Tibetan Plateau (TP) between 1978 and 2001 are analyzed using
   observations from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), Global
   Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), and reanalysis data from both
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction and European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Results show that total column ozone
   reduction in nine persistent (lasting for at least 2 days) and four
   transient events can be substantially attributed to ozone reduction in
   the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere region (below 25 km). This
   reduction is generally caused by uplift of the local tropopause and
   northward transport of tropical ozone-poor air associated with an
   anomalous anticyclone in the upper troposphere. These anticyclonic
   anomalies are closely related to anomalous tropical deep convective
   heating, which is, however, not necessarily phase locked with the
   tropical Madden-Julian Oscillation as in our earlier case study.
   Considering stratospheric processes, the selected 13 events can be
   combined into nine independent events. Moreover, five of the nine
   independent events, especially the persistent events, are coupled with
   contributions from stratospheric dynamics between 25 and 40 km, i.e.,
   15\%-40\% derived from GOME observations for events in November 1998,
   February 1999, and December 2001. On the basis of these events,
   stratospheric column ozone reduction over the TP region can be
   attributed to the dynamics (development and/or displacement) of the two
   main stratospheric systems, namely, the polar vortex and the Aleutian
   High. The effect of a ``low-ozone pocket{''} inside the Aleutian High on
   the total column ozone in East Asia requires further study.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast with most Monte Carlo integration algorithms, which are used
   to estimate ratios, the replica gas identities recently introduced by
   Adib enable the estimation of absolute integrals and partition functions

   Here, an optimized form is presented. After generalizing a replica gas
   identity with an arbitrary weighting function, we obtain a functional
   form that has the minimal asymptotic variance for samples from two
   replicas and is provably good for a larger number. This equation is
   demonstrated to improve the convergence of partition function estimates

Abstract = {{Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their lympho-hematopoietic progeny
   are supported by microenvironmental niches within bone marrow; however,
   the identity, nature, and function of these niches remain unclear.
   Short-term ablation of CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)12-abundant reticular
   (CAR) cells in vivo did not affect the candidate niches, bone-lining
   osteoblasts, or endothelial cells but severely impaired the adipogenic
   and osteogenic differentiation potential of marrow cells and production
   of the cytokines SCF and CXCL12 and led to a marked reduction in cycling
   lymphoid and erythroid progenitors. HSCs from CAR cell-depleted mice
   were reduced in number and cell size, were more quiescent, and had
   increased expression of early myeloid selector genes, similar to the
   phenotype of wild-type HSCs cultured without a niche. Thus, the niche
   composed of adipo-osteogenic progenitors is required for proliferation
   of HSCs and lymphoid and erythroid progenitors, as well as maintenance
   of HSCs in an undifferentiated state.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Adipokines contribute directly to the coexistence of insulin
   resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Most studies focus on a single
   adipokine. We therefore investigated the independent relationships of
   leptin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-a, resistin and visfatin, as
   well as the gut hormone ghrelin with blood pressure and insulin
   resistance. Secondly we evaluated the interrelationships of adipokines
   and ghrelin in concert with various cardiometabolic markers.
   Methods and Results: Caucasian women (N = 115) with varying levels of
   obesity (aged 31.3 +/- 9.18 years) were included. Significant
   correlations of leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin and visfatin with mean
   arterial pressure (p<0.05) disappeared after adjustment for age, body
   mass index and waist circumference. But significant correlations with
   insulin resistance (HOMA) (for leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin) remained
   significant after adjustments. Factor analyses yielded five factors, but
   two main clusters, namely a metabolic syndrome cluster (including
   leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin) and a vascular atherosclerotic cluster
   (including tumor necrosis factor-a, visfatin and resistin).
   Conclusion: Factor analyses identified patterns which indicate specific
   roles of the various adipokines. Leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin were
   more closely related to insulin resistance and central obesity as core
   components of the metabolic syndrome. Visfatin, tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha and resistin seem to direct their effects onto the vascular
   system possibly by means of mechanisms such as inflammation,
   vasoconstriction and coagulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: The constantly growing amount of different kinds of colloid
   fluids necessitates comparative investigations with regards to the
   safety and effectivity in clinical use of these preparations. Hence we
   compared three colloid fluids in an observational study. The objective
   was the exploration of the influence of these three colloids on blood
   coagulation, hemodynamics and renal function of the cardiac surgical
   patient.
   Methods: We included 90 patients undergoing an elective open-heart
   surgery with the use of the heart-lung machine and observed them
   consecutively. Group 1 {[}gelatin 4\% (n = 30)], Group 2 {[}HES 200/0,5
   (n = 30)] and Group 3 {[}HES 130/0,42 (n = 30)]. We measured the
   perioperative volume replacement, the administration of blood- and
   coagulation-products, the application of catecholamines, the renal
   function, blood gas and the platelet aggregation using multiplate
   electrode analyzer (Multiplate (R), Dynabyte medical, Munich, Germany).
   Results: The gelatin-group needed significantly more norepinephrine than
   the HES 130/0.42 group. The responsible surgeon considered the blood
   coagulation in the HES 200/0.5 group most frequently as impaired.
   Furthermore we saw a significant decrease in platelet function in the
   HES 200/0.5 group when performing the multiplate (R)-analysis (ADP-and
   COL-test). HES 130/0.4 as well as gelatin 4\% showed no significant
   change in platelet function. The gelatin-group and the HES 200/0.5
   needed significantly more aprotinine than the HES 130/0.4 group. We saw
   no significant difference with regards to administration of blood and
   coagulation products between the three groups. The urinary excretion
   during the intervention was significantly higher in the HES 200/0.5
   group and in the gelatin group than in the HES 130/0.4 group.
   Conclusions: Our results confirm the lower stabilizing effect of gelatin
   on circulation during fluid resuscitation. The blood coagulation was
   mostly impaired clue to HES 200/0.5 confirmed by the multiplate
   (R)-analysis as well as by different clinical findings.}},

Abstract = {{Uniform and well-defined single-crystalline Ln(OH)(3) and La(OH)(3):Eu3+
   (Ln: lanthanide ion) nanorods were successfully synthesized by a
   large-scale and facile hydrothermal method only using Ln(NO3)(3)center
   dot 6H(2)O as lanthanide source and H2O2 as controller without any
   surfactant or template. The as-formed product via the hydrothermal
   process, La(OH)(3):Eu3+, could transform to hexagonal La2O3:Eu3+ with
   the same morphology by a postannealing process. The above mentioned
   samples were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and
   photoluminescence (PL) spectra. By tuning the hydrothermal treatment
   time, a morphological evolution between the nanoparticles and nanorods
   was observed. Furthermore the growth mechanism and the morphological
   evolution of different shapes were investigated. Unlike traditional
   synthesis of Ln(OH)(3), H2O2 does not leave any impurity in the reaction
   system and makes the process very simple to obtain and separate the
   nanoparticles, nanomultipods and nanorods morphology. The La2O3:Eu3+
   nanorods exhibit a strong red emission corresponding to D-5(0) -> F-7(2)
   transition (625 nm) of Eu3+ under UV light excitation (282 nm), which
   have potential applications in fluorescent devices. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{N-alpha-Boc-L-Asp(OBn)-L-Lys(Z)-OtBu (reversin 121, I), an inhibitor of

   transport sites of P-gp, respectively H and R sites. Replacement of the
   aspartyl residue by trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline (4(R)Hyp) gave compounds
   11 and 15 characterized by half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (1050)
   of 0.6 and 0.2 mu M, which are 2- and 7-fold lower than that of the
   parent molecule. The difference in IC50 between 11 and 15 rests on the
   carbonyl group of the peptidyl bond, reduced in 15. Those compounds are
   rather specific of P-gp, having no or limited activity on MRP1 and BCRP.
   15 displayed no marked cytotoxicity up to 10-fold its IC50. Importantly,
   15 equally inhibited the Hoechst 33342 and daunorubicin effluxes through
   a typical noncompetitive inhibition mechanism, suggesting its binding to

Abstract = {{The availability of the double-differential charged-current neutrino
   cross section, measured by the MiniBooNE Collaboration by using a carbon
   target, allows for a systematic comparison of nuclear effects in

   based on the impulse approximation scheme and a state-of-the-art model
   of the nuclear spectral functions, suggest that the electron cross
   section and the flux averaged neutrino cross sections, corresponding to
   the same target and comparable kinematical conditions, cannot be
   described within the same theoretical approach using the value of the
   nucleon axial mass obtained from deuterium measurements. We analyze the
   assumptions underlying the treatment of electron-scattering data and

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel graphene (G) based solid-phase microextraction
   (SPME) fiber was firstly prepared by immobilizing the synthesized Con
   stainless steel wire as coating. The new fiber possessed a homogeneous,
   porous and wrinkled surface and showed excellent thermal (over 330
   degrees C). chemical and mechanical stability, and long lifespan (over
   250 extractions). The SPME performance of the G-coated fiber was
   evaluated in detail through extraction of six pyrethroid pesticides.
   Although the thickness of G-coated fiber was only 6-8 mu m, its
   extraction efficiencies were higher than those of two commercial fibers
   (PDMS, 100 mu m; PDMS/DVB, 65 mu m). This high extraction efficiency may
   be mainly attributed to huge delocalized pi-electron system of G, which
   shows strong pi-stacking interaction with pyrethroid pesticide. The
   G-coated fiber was applied in the gas chromatographic determination of
   six pyrethroids, and their limits of detection were found to be ranged
   from 3.69 to 69.4 ng L-1. The reproducibility for each single fiber was
   evaluated and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were calculated to
   be in the range from 1.9\% to 6.5\%. The repeatability of fiber-to-fiber
   and batch-to-batch was 4.3-9.2\% and 4.1-9.9\%. The method developed was
   successfully applied to three pond water samples, and the recoveries
   were 83-110\% at a spiking of 1 mu g L-1. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in developing a nonfluorous capping
   ligand that is effective in dispersing nanoparticles in supercritical
   carbon dioxide. To augment the experimental search for such a molecule,
   a simulation protocol is developed, involving atomistic molecular
   dynamics simulations, which captures the relevant physical phenomena
   related to the effectiveness of capping ligands in stabilizing
   nanoparticle dispersions, evidenced by a consistency with empirical
   observation. The method is used to determine why the cheap and benign
   alkanethiol ligands are effective in supercritical ethane and several
   organic solvents but not in supercritical CO2 at convenient conditions
   of temperature and pressure; n-dodecanethiol is used as the
   representative ligand. We conclude that the ineffectiveness of the
   alkanethiol ligands in CO2 is primarily because they cannot compensate
   for the quadrupolar interactions which account for a substantial portion
   of the cohesive energy of bulk CO2, which is lost to the CO2 molecules
   when transitioning from bulk solvent to the confined region between
   approaching nanoparticles, thus reducing the degree of osmotic
   repulsion. Ethane, which largely lacks significant electrostatic
   interactions, is adequately compensated for transitioning into the
   confinement by surface dispersion interactions. Hence, ligands that
   would be more effective in stabilizing nanoparticle dispersions in
   supercritical CO2 should interact with CO2 not only via dispersion
   interactions but also via its quadrupole. We find that the solvent does
   not penetrate the densely packed ligand-passivation layer at the
   nanoparticle surface, and solvent interacts only with the ligand tips.
   Hence, experiments intended to screen for effective ligands should probe
   ligand behavior not in an isotropic bulk system but in heterogeneous
   conditions similar to the ligand-solvent interface.}},

Abstract = {{Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is the prototypical
   microangiopathy characterized by disseminated microthromboses, hemolytic
   anemia, and ultimately organ dysfunction. A link with deficiency of the
   von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) has been
   demonstrated, but additional genetic and/or environmental triggers are
   thought to be required to incite acute illness. Here we report that 4
   days of ADAMTS13 functional inhibition is sufficient to induce TTP in
   the baboon (Papio ursinus), in the absence of inciting triggers because
   injections with an inhibitory monoclonal antibody (mAb) consistently (n
   = 6) induced severe thrombocytopenia (< 12 x 10(9)/L), microangiopathic
   hemolytic anemia, and a rapid rise in serum lactate dehydrogenase.
   Immunohistochemical staining revealed the characteristic disseminated
   platelet-and von Willebrand factor-rich thrombi in kidney, heart, brain,
   and spleen but not lungs. Prolonged inhibition (14 days, n = 1) caused
   myocardial ischemic damage and asplenia but not death. Control animals
   (n = 5) receiving equal doses of a noninhibitory anti-ADAMTS13 mAb
   remained unaffected. Our results provide evidence for a direct link
   between TTP and ADAMTS13 inhibition and for a mild disease onset.
   Furthermore, we present a reliable animal model of this disease as an
   opportunity for the development and validation of novel treatment
   strategies. (Blood. 2010;116(12):2005-2010)}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{The doping dependence of spin excitations in Ba(Fe1-xCox)(2)As-2 is
   studied based on a phenomenological two-orbital model under the
   random-phase approximation. We adopt this model because of its ability
   to fit the doping evolution of the Fermi surfaces and the asymmetry in
   the superconductivity (SC) coherent peaks as observed, respectively, by
   the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and the scanning
   tunneling microscopy experiments in this type of compounds. The
   interplay between the spin-density wave and SC is considered in our
   calculation. Our results for the spin susceptibility are in qualitative
   agreement with neutron-scattering (NS) experiments in various doping
   ranges at temperatures above and below the superconducting transition
   temperature T-c. For the overdoped sample where one of the two hole
   pockets around Gamma point disappears according to ARPES, we show that
   the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility in both SC and normal
   phases exhibits a gaplike behavior. This feature is consistent with the
   ``pseudogap{''} as observed by recent nuclear magnetic resonance and NS
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We report a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the
   layered antimonide PrMnSbO which is isostructural to the parent phase of
   the iron pnictide superconductors. We find linear resistivity near room
   temperature and Fermi liquidlike T-2 behavior below 150 K. Neutron
   powder diffraction shows that unfrustrated C-type Mn magnetic order
   develops below similar to 230 K, followed by a spin flop coupled to
   induced Pr order. At T similar to 35 K, we find a tetragonal to
   orthorhombic (T-O) transition. First-principles calculations show that
   the large magnetic moments observed in this metallic compound are of
   local origin. Our results are thus inconsistent with either the
   itinerant or frustrated models proposed for symmetry breaking in the
   iron pnictides. We show that PrMnSbO is instead a rare example of a
   metal where structural distortions are driven by f-electron degrees of
   freedom.}},

Abstract = {{Room-temperature ferromagnetism has been observed in Y-doped AlN (AlN:Y)
   nanorods. Our first-principle calculations have demonstrated that the
   ferromagnetism in AlN:Y is from Al vacancies and that the introduction
   of nonmagnetic rare-earth element Y into AlN can significantly reduce
   the formation energy of Al vacancy which leads to high Al vacancies
   responsible for the observed ferromagnetism in AlN:Y nanorods. These
   findings illustrate an efficient way to reduce the formation energy of
   cation vacancy by doping nonmagnetic elements, such as Y, leading to
   ferromagnetism in semiconductors.}},

Abstract = {{Semiempirical quantum-chemical calculations are used to simulate the
   optical properties of a series of green light-emitting nematic liquid
   crystals containing fluorene, thiophene, or thienothiophene groups with
   solid-state photoluminescence quantum efficiencies up to 0.36. We use a
   simple model of two parallel and closely spaced molecules in an
   anticofacial configuration to study intermolecular interactions in the
   solid state and slide one past the other to mimic the high orientational
   and low positional order of the nematic phase. We find that switching
   between H and J aggregates can be triggered by longitudinal
   displacements of the molecules with respect to one another by an extent
   that closely follows the chemical structure of the interacting
   chromophores. We discuss the implications of aggregate formation for
   efficient light emission in conjugated oligomers and polymers that show
   nematic or smectic order.}},

Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{We study the family of steady shapes which arise when a magnetic liquid
   droplet is confined in a rotating Hele-Shaw cell and subjected to an
   azimuthal magnetic field. Two different scenarios are considered: first,
   the magnetic fluid is assumed to be a Newtonian ferrofluid, and then it
   is taken as a viscoelastic magnetorheological fluid. The influence of
   the distinct material properties of the fluids on the ultimate
   morphology of the emerging stationary patterns is investigated by using
   a vortex-sheet formalism. Some of these exact steady structures are
   similar to the advanced time patterns obtained by existing time-evolving
   numerical simulations of the problem. A weakly nonlinear approach is
   employed to examine this fact and to gain analytical insight about
   relevant aspects related to the stability of such exact stationary
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Cilia are wavy hair like structures that extend outward from surfaces of
   various organisms. They are classified into two general categories,
   primary cilia which exhibits sensing attributes, and motile cilia, which
   exert mechanical, forces. A new poly(2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl
   methacrylate-co-n-butyl acrylate-co-N,N-(dimethylamino) azobenzene
   acrylamide) (p(DMAEMA/nBA/DMAAZOAm) copolymer is prepared using
   colloidal synthesis, which, upon coalescence, form films capable of
   generating surfaces with cilia-like features. While film morphological
   features allow the formation of wavy whiskers, the chemical composition
   of the copolymer facilitates chemical, thermal, and electromagnetic
   responses manifested by simultaneous shape and color changes as well as
   excitation wavelength dependent fluorescence. These studies demonstrate
   that synthetically produced polymeric films can exhibit combined
   thermal, chemical, and electromagnetic sensing leading to locomotive and
   color responses, which may find numerous applications in sensing
   devices, intelligent actuators, defensive mechanisms, and others.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{We explore the discovery potential of doubly charged Higgs bosons
   (xi(+/-+/-)) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). For moderate
   values of the coupling constants in the original Type-II seesaw model,
   these doubly charged Higgs bosons are not accessible at any present or
   near future collider experiments. In a gauged B - L symmetric model we
   introduce two triplet scalars to execute a variant of type-II seesaw at
   the TeV scale. This leads to a clear like-sign dilepton signal in the
   decay mode of xi(+/-+/-) for a small vacuum expectation value (less than
   or similar to 10(5) eV) of the triplet scalar xi = (xi(++), xi(+),
   xi(0)) of mass less than or similar to 1 TeV. To be specific, for a mass
   range of 200-1000 GeV of xi(+/-+/-), the like-sign dilepton signal can
   be detected at CERN LHC at a center of mass energy 14 TeV with an
   integrated luminosity, say, greater than or similar to 30 fb(-1). The
   same analysis is also pursued with center of mass energies 7 TeV and 10
   TeV as well. We also comment on the decay mode of singly charged scalars
   and the neutral B - L gauge boson in this model.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2010}},

Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{Short-term slow slip events accompanied by nonvolcanic deep
   low-frequency tremors and deep very low frequency earthquakes in
   southwest Japan were investigated systematically by means of ground
   tilting studies. The change in tilt usually lasts for several days. By
   using a genetic algorithm and a least squares method, we inverted the
   data for tilt steps that were caused by slow slip events and were
   detected by at least four stations situated near the source of the
   tremor. Fault parameters were estimated for 54 slow slip episodes that
   occurred mainly in the western Shikoku, northeastern Kii, and Tokai
   regions from 2001 to 2008. In eastern Shikoku, two slow slip episodes
   were detected quantitatively for the first time. The fault geometries of
   all the slow slip events were located within the belt-like distribution
   of tremors in the transition zone between the locked and aseismic slip
   zones at the plate interface of the subducting Philippine Sea Plate. The
   spatial extent of the fault geometry corresponds roughly to the
   distribution of clusters of nonvolcanic tremors and very low frequency
   earthquakes. The moment magnitudes ranged from 5.4 to 6.2, and the slip
   was similar to 1 cm for each slow slip event. The rate of moment release
   by the detected slow slip events was 40-60\% of the moment accumulation
   expected from the relative plate motion, and it showed regional
   differences. They may reflect the along-strike variations in plate
   convergence and/or the characteristic size of the slow slip fault plane
   on the plate interface.}},

Abstract = {{The pyramidalizations of N9/1 glycosidic nitrogens in DNA and RNA
   nucleosides, recently discovered and analyzed in their
   ultrahigh-resolution X-ray crystal structures (Sychrovsky; et al.
   Nucleic Acid Res. 2009, 37, 7321.), were found to have significant
   effects on the structural interpretation of the (3)J(C4/2-H1') and
   3J(C8/6-H1') NMR scalar couplings in purine/pyrimidine nucleosides. The
   calculated effects on IR and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD)
   spectra were only minor. The calculated structural deformations in
   nucleosides, depending on sugar-to-base orientation, gave rise to
   corrections in the phase shift of the Karplus equations for the
   (3)J(C8/6-H1') and (3)J(C4/2-H1') couplings ranging from -26 degrees to
   +25 degrees and from -5.7 degrees to +2.0 degrees, respectively. The
   sign alternation of this correction in syn and anti nucleosides arises
   from the stereoinversion of the N9/1 glycosidic nitrogen occurring upon
   reorientation of the glycosidic torsion. The effect was calculated
   consistently in the dG, dA, dC, dT, rA, and rG nucleosides. Utilization
   of the calculated phase-shift corrections in the design of Karplus
   equations for the (3)J couplings was suggested, and the effects on
   structural interpretation of the experimental couplings were evaluated.}},

   a C-18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) and followed by NH2 SPE cartridge.
   The analytes were quantified by liquid chromatography using a BEN C-18
   column coupled to an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer
   (LC-ESI-MS/MS) operating in negative mode for estrogens and in positive
   multiple reaction monitoring mode for androgens. The parameters of the
   mass spectrometer and the composition of mobile phase and additives were
   also optimized to enhance detection sensitivity. Average recoveries of
   the target compounds varied from 70.0\% to 121.0\% with relative
   standard deviations ranging from 2.3\% to 11.2\% at two fortification
   levels. The limits of detection (LOD) of the method were from 0.002 mu g
   kg(-1) to 0.23 mu g kg(-1) and the limits of quantification (LOQ) were
   in the range of 0.007-0.76 mu g kg(-1). (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights

Abstract = {{Intense measurements on a giant dust event sweeping over the Asian
   continent during springtime were conducted in Beijing from 16 to 20
   April 2006. Beijing suffered from a large amount of mineral dust
   transported long range from upwind regions, identified as the desert
   areas of Mongolia and Inner Mongolia. During the prime time of dust
   event, hourly PM10 concentrations increased drastically to 1200 mu
   g/m(3), corresponding to the lowest visibility of 3 km. The mass
   concentrations of major crustal elements in aerosols during dusty days
   were nearly double those of nondusty days. The quasistationary front had
   great contributions to the formation of severe dusty days over Beijing
   because of an equiponderant confluence of northern cold air masses from
   a Siberian anticyclone and southern warm air masses. During the dust
   event, northeast jets below the convective atmosphere boundary layer
   occurred at multilevel heights of 50-65 m, 100-160 m, and 160-260 m,
   with the highest wind speed exceeding 14 m s(-1). Humidity inversions
   usually occurred at heights of 160-240 m, 60-140 m, and 5-30 m due to
   the cold air horizontal advection. The enhancement of dust loadings in
   the atmosphere of Beijing during the dust event resulted in a cooling
   effect by -62.0 W m(-2) radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical switching and electrochromic phenomena of a novel
   nanocomposite comprising poly(p-phenylenebenzobisthiazole) (PBZT) and
   tungsten oxide (WO3) nanoparticles are investigated as a function of the
   nanoparticle loading. Both dissolving PBZT and doping PBZT backbone
   structure with acid are achieved by one simple step. Chlorosulfonic acid
   (CSA) is used as a solvent and spontaneously transformed to sulfuric
   acid upon exposure to moisture. The formed sulfuric acid serves as
   doping agent to improve the electrical conductivity of PBZT. The most
   significant enhancement of electrical switching is observed in the
   nanocomposites with low weight fraction (5\%). The electrical
   conductivity of 5\% WO3/PBZT nanocomposite thin film is increased by
   about 200 times and 2 times, respectively, as compared to those of the
   as-received PBZT and PBZT/CSA thin films. As the nanoparticle loading
   increases to 20\% and 30\%, the nanocomposites follow an ohmic
   conduction mechanism. Stable electrical conductivity switching is
   observed before and after applying a bias on the pristine PBZT and
   WO3/PBZT nanocomposite thin films. Electrochromic phenomena of both PBZT
   and WO3/PBZT nanocomposite thin films with high contrast ratio are
   observed after applying a bias (3 V). The mechanisms of the
   nanoparticles in enhancing the electrical switching and electrochromic
   properties are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Integral cross-section measurements for the system water-H-2 in
   molecular-beam scattering experiments are reported. Their analysis
   demonstrates that the average attractive component of the water-H-2
   intermolecular potential in the well region is about 30\% stronger than
   dispersion and induction forces would imply. An extensive and detailed
   theoretical analysis of the electron charge displacement accompanying
   the interaction, over several crucial sections of the potential energy
   surface (PES), shows that water-H-2 interaction is accompanied by charge
   transfer (CT) and that the observed stabilization energy correlates
   quantitatively with CT magnitude at all distances. Based on the
   experimentally determined potential and the calculated CT, a general
   theoretical model is devised which reproduces very accurately PES
   sections obtained at the CCSD(T) level with large basis sets. The energy
   stabilization associated with CT is calculated to be 2.5 eV per electron
   transferred. Thus, CT is shown to be a significant, strongly
   stereospecific component of the interaction, with water functioning as
   electron donor or acceptor in different orientations. The general
   relevance of these findings for water's chemistry is discussed.}},

   (LSGM) electrolyte (1:1 weight ratio) annealed at 1000 degrees C for
   24-48 h is studied. Peak broadening and shifting in the diffraction
   patterns are explained as diffusion of cations from one phase to the
   other: these findings are corroborated by the ESEM/EDX analysis. No
   diffraction peaks from reaction products are found. These results showed
   that the use of La2-xSrxCuO4-delta (x = 0.1 and 0.2) cathode material in

Title = {{A Hierarchical Phosphorylation Cascade That Regulates the Timing of
   PERIOD Nuclear Entry Reveals Novel Roles for Proline-Directed Kinases

Abstract = {{The daily timing of when PERIOD (PER) proteins translocate from the
   cytoplasm to the nucleus is a critical step in clock mechanisms
   underpinning circadian rhythms in animals. Numerous lines of evidence
   indicate that phosphorylation plays a prominent role in regulating
   various aspects of PER function and metabolism, including changes in its
   daily stability and subcellular distribution. In this report, we show
   that phosphorylation of serine 661 (Ser661) by a proline-directed
   kinase(s) is a key phospho-signal on the Drosophila PER protein (dPER)
   that regulates the timing of its nuclear accumulation. Mutations that
   block phosphorylation at Ser661 do not affect dPER stability but delay
   its nuclear entry in key pacemaker neurons, yielding longer behavioral
   rhythms. Intriguingly, abolishing phosphorylation at Ser661 also
   attenuates the extent of dPER hyperphosphorylation in vivo, suggesting
   the phosphorylated state of Ser661 regulates phosphorylation at other
   sites on dPER. Indeed, we identify Ser657 as a site that is
   phosphorylated by the glycogen synthase kinase GSK-3 beta (SHAGGY; SGG)
   in a manner dependent on priming at Ser661. Although not as dramatic as
   mutating Ser661, mutations that abolish phosphorylation at Ser657 also
   lead to longer behavioral periods, suggesting that a multi-kinase
   hierarchical phosphorylation module regulates the timing of dPER nuclear
   entry. Together with evidence in mammalian systems, our findings
   implicate proline-directed kinases in clock mechanisms and suggest that
   PER proteins are key downstream targets of lithium therapy, a potent
   inhibitor of GSK-3 beta used to treat manic depression, a disorder
   associated with clock malfunction in humans.}},

Title = {{Thyroid Hormones Regulate Selenoprotein Expression and Selenium Status
   in Mice}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Impaired expression of selenium-containing proteins leads to perturbed
   thyroid hormone (TH) levels, indicating the central importance of
   selenium for TH homeostasis. Moreover, critically ill patients with
   declining serum selenium develop a syndrome of low circulating TH and a
   central downregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis. This
   prompted us to test the reciprocal effect, i.e., if TH status would also
   regulate selenoprotein expression and selenium levels. To investigate
   the TH dependency of selenium metabolism, we analyzed mice expressing a
   mutant TH receptor alpha 1 (TR alpha 1+m) that confers a
   receptor-mediated hypothyroidism. Serum selenium was reduced in these
   animals, which was a direct consequence of the mutant TR alpha 1 and not
   related to their metabolic alterations. Accordingly, hyperthyroidism,
   genetically caused by the inactivation of TR beta or by oral TH
   treatment of adult mice, increased serum selenium levels in TR alpha 1+m
   and controls, thus demonstrating a novel and specific role for TR alpha
   1 in selenium metabolism. Furthermore, TH affected the mRNA levels for
   several enzymes involved in selenoprotein biosynthesis as well as serum
   selenoprotein P concentrations and the expression of other antioxidative
   selenoproteins. Taken together, our results show that TH positively
   affects the serum selenium status and regulates the expression of
   several selenoproteins. This demonstrates that selenium and TH
   metabolism are interconnected through a feed-forward regulation, which
   can in part explain the rapid parallel downregulation of both systems in
   critical illness.}},

Abstract = {{Context Motivating patients with heart failure to adhere to medical
   advice has not translated into clinical benefit, but past trials have
   had methodological limitations.
   Objective To determine the value of self-management counseling plus
   heart failure education, compared with heart failure education alone,
   for the primary end point of death or heart failure hospitalization.
   Design, Setting, and Patients The Heart Failure Adherence and Retention
   Trial (HART), a single-center, multiple-hospital, partially blinded
   behavioral efficacy randomized controlled trial involving 902 patients
   with mild to moderate heart failure and reduced or preserved systolic
   function, randomized from the Chicago metropolitan area between October
   2001 and October 2004 and undergoing follow-up for 2 to 3 subsequent
   years.
   Interventions All patients were offered 18 contacts and 18 heart failure
   educational tip sheets during the course of 1 year. Patients randomized
   to the education group received tip sheets in the mail and telephone
   calls to check comprehension. Patients randomized to the self-management
   group received tip sheets in groups and were taught self-management
   skills to implement the advice.
   Main Outcome Measure Death or heart failure hospitalization during a
   median of 2.56 years of follow-up.
   Results Patients were representative of typical clinical populations
   (mean age, 63.6 years; 47\% women, 40\% racial/ethnic minority, 52\%
   with annual family income less than \$30 000, and 23\% with preserved
   systolic function). The rate of the primary end point in the
   self-management group was no different from that in the education group
   (163 {[}40.1\%)] vs 171 {[}41.2\%], respectively; odds ratio, 0.95
   {[}95\% confidence interval, 0.72-1.26]). There were no significant
   differences on any secondary end points, including death, heart failure
   hospitalization, all-cause hospitalization, or quality of life.
   Conclusions Compared with an enhanced educational intervention alone,
   the addition of self-management counseling did not reduce death or heart
   failure hospitalization in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.}},

Title = {{Association of Telomere Length of Peripheral Blood Leukocytes With

   Aplastic Anemia}},

Abstract = {{Context Critically short telomeres produce apoptosis, cell senescence,
   and chromosomal instability in tissue culture and animal models.
   Variations in telomere length have been reported in severe aplastic
   anemia but their clinical significance is unknown.
   Objective To investigate the relationship between telomere length and
   clinical outcomes in severe aplastic anemia.
   Design, Setting, and Patients Single institution analysis of 183
   patients with severe aplastic anemia who were treated in sequential
   prospective protocols at the National Institutes of Health from 2000 to
   2008. The pretreatment leukocyte age-adjusted telomere length of
   patients with severe aplastic anemia consecutively enrolled in
   immunosuppression protocols with antithymocyte globulin plus
   cyclosporine for correlation with clinical outcomes were analyzed.
   Main Outcome Measures Hematologic response, relapse, clonal evolution,
   and survival.
   Results There was no relationship between hematologic response and
   telomere length with response rates of 56.5\% of 46 patients in the
   first, 54.3\% of 46 in the second, 60\% of 45 in the third, and 56.5\%
   of 46 in the fourth quartiles. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that
   telomere length was associated with relapse, clonal evolution, and
   mortality. Evaluated as a continuous variable, telomere length inversely
   correlated with the probability of hematologic relapse (hazard ratio
   {[}HR], 0.16; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.03-0.69; P=.01). The
   probability of clonal evolution was higher in patients in the first
   quartile (24.5\%; 95\% CI, 8.7\%-37.5\%) than in quartiles 2 through 4
   (8.4\%; 95\% CI, 3.2\%-13.3\%; P=.009), and evolution to monosomy 7 or
   complex cytogenetics was more common in the first quartile (18.8\%; 95\%
   CI, 3.5\%-31.6\%) than in quartiles 2 through 4 (4.5\%; 95\% CI,
   0.5\%-8.2\%; P=.002). Survival between these 2 groups differed, with
   66\% (95\% CI, 52.9\%-82.5\%) surviving 6 years in the first quartile
   compared with 83.8\% (95\% CI, 77.3\%-90.9\%) in quartiles 2 through 4
   (P=.008).
   Conclusion In a cohort of patients with severe aplastic anemia receiving
   immunosuppressive therapy, telomere length was unrelated to response but
   was associated with risk of relapse, clonal evolution, and overall
   survival. JAMA. 2010; 304(12): 1358-1364}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical testing of collagenous tissues at different length scales
   will provide improved understanding of the mechanical behavior of
   structures such as skin, tendon, and bone, and also guide the
   development of multiscale mechanical models. Using a
   microelectromechanical-systems (MEMS) platform, stress-strain response
   curves up to failure of type I collagen fibril specimens isolated from
   the dermis of sea cucumbers were obtained in vitro. A majority of the
   fibril specimens showed brittle fracture. Some displayed linear behavior
   up to failure, while others displayed some nonlinearity. The fibril
   specimens showed an elastic modulus of 470 +/- 410 MPa, a fracture
   strength of 230 +/- 160 MPa, and a fracture strain of 80\% +/- 44\%. The
   fibril specimens displayed significantly lower elastic modulus in vitro
   than previously measured in air. Fracture strength/strain obtained in
   vitro and in air are both significantly larger than those obtained in
   vacuo, indicating that the difference arises from the lack of
   intrafibrillar water molecules produced by vacuum drying. Furthermore,
   fracture strength/strain of fibril specimens were different from those
   reported for collagenous tissues of higher hierarchical levels,
   indicating the importance of obtaining these properties at the fibrillar
   level for multiscale modeling.}},

Title = {{ModuleOrganizer: detecting modules in families of transposable elements}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most known eukaryotic genomes contain mobile copied elements
   called transposable elements. In some species, these elements account
   for the majority of the genome sequence. They have been subject to many
   mutations and other genomic events (copies, deletions, captures) during
   transposition. The identification of these transformations remains a
   difficult issue. The study of families of transposable elements is
   generally founded on a multiple alignment of their sequences, a critical
   step that is adapted to transposons containing mostly localized
   nucleotide mutations. Many transposons that have lost their
   protein-coding capacity have undergone more complex rearrangements,
   needing the development of more complex methods in order to characterize
   the architecture of sequence variations.
   Results: In this study, we introduce the concept of a transposable
   element module, a flexible motif present in at least two sequences of a
   family of transposable elements and built on a succession of maximal
   repeats. The paper proposes an assembly method working on a set of exact
   maximal repeats of a set of sequences to create such modules. It results
   in a graphical view of sequences segmented into modules, a
   representation that allows a flexible analysis of the transformations
   that have occurred between them. We have chosen as a demonstration data
   set in depth analysis of the transposable element Foldback in Drosophila
   melanogaster. Comparison with multiple alignment methods shows that our
   method is more sensitive for highly variable sequences. The study of
   this family and the two other families AtREP21 and SIDER2 reveals new
   copies of very different sizes and various combinations of modules which
   show the potential of our method.
   Conclusions: ModuleOrganizer is available on the Genouest bioinformatics
   center at http://moduleorganizer. genouest.org.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic transport through a two-level system driven by external
   electric field and coupled to (magnetic or nonmagnetic) electron
   reservoirs is considered theoretically. The basic transport
   characteristics such as charge and spin current and tunnel
   magnetoresistance (TMR) are calculated in the weak-coupling
   approximation by the use of rate equation connected with Green's
   function formalism and slave-boson approach. The time-dependent
   phenomenon is considered in the gradient expansion approximation. The
   results show that coherent beating pattern can be observed both in
   current and TMR. The proposed system consisting of two quantum dots
   attached to external leads, in which the dots' levels can be tuned
   independently, can be realized experimentally to test this well-known
   physical phenomenon. Finally, we also indicate possible practical
   applications of such device.}},

Title = {{Duplicate dmbx1 genes regulate progenitor cell cycle and differentiation
   during zebrafish midbrain and retinal development}},
Journal = {{BMC DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Dmbx1 gene is important for the development of the
   midbrain and hindbrain, and mouse gene targeting experiments reveal that
   this gene is required for mediating postnatal and adult feeding
   behaviours. A single Dmbx1 gene exists in terrestrial vertebrate
   genomes, while teleost genomes have at least two paralogs. We compared
   the loss of function of the zebrafish dmbx1a and dmbx1b genes in order
   to gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which dmbx1 regulates
   neurogenesis, and to begin to understand why these duplicate genes have
   been retained in the zebrafish genome.
   Results: Using gene knockdown experiments we examined the function of
   the dmbx1 gene paralogs in zebrafish, dmbx1a and dmbx1b in regulating
   neurogenesis in the developing retina and midbrain. Dose-dependent loss
   of dmbx1a and dmbx1b function causes a significant reduction in growth
   of the midbrain and retina that is evident between 48 72 hpf. We show
   that this phenotype is not due to patterning defects or persistent cell
   death, but rather a deficit in progenitor cell cycle exit and
   differentiation. Analyses of the morphant retina or anterior hindbrain
   indicate that paralogous function is partially diverged since loss of
   dmbx1a is more severe than loss of dmbx1b. Molecular evolutionary
   analyses of the Dmbx1 genes suggest that while this gene family is
   conservative in its evolution, there was a dramatic change in selective
   constraint after the duplication event that gave rise to the dmbx1a and
   dmbx1b gene families in teleost fish, suggestive of positive selection.
   Interestingly, in contrast to zebrafish dmbx1a, over expression of the
   mouse Dmbx1 gene does not functionally compensate for the zebrafish
   dmbx1a knockdown phenotype, while over expression of the dmbx1b gene
   only partially compensates for the dmbx1a knockdown phenotype.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that both zebrafish dmbx1a and dmbx1b genes
   are retained in the fish genome due to their requirement during midbrain
   and retinal neurogenesis, although their function is partially diverged.
   At the cellular level, Dmbx1 regulates cell cycle exit and
   differentiation of progenitor cells. The unexpected observation of
   putative post-duplication positive selection of teleost Dmbx1 genes,
   especially dmbx1a, and the differences in functionality between the
   mouse and zebrafish genes suggests that the teleost Dmbx1 genes may have
   evolved a diverged function in the regulation of neurogenesis.}},

   Protein DesVIII in the Methymycin/Pikromycin Biosynthetic Pathway}},

Abstract = {{The in vitro characterization of the catalytic activity of DesVII, the
   glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the macrolide
   antibiotics methymycin, neomethymycin, narbomycin, and pikromycin in
   Streptomyces venezuelae, is described. DesVII is unique among
   glycosyltransferases in that it requires an additional protein
   component, DesVIII, for activity. Characterization of the metabolites
   produced by a S. venezuelae mutant lacking the des VIII gene confirmed
   that des VIII is important for the biosynthesis of elycosylated
   macrolides but can be replaced by at least one of the homologous genes
   from other pathways. The addition of recombinant DesVIII protein
   significantly improves the glycosylation efficiency of DesVII in the in
   vitro assay. When affinity-tagged DesVII and DesVIII proteins were
   coproduced in Escherichia coli, they formed a tight (alpha beta)(3)
   complex that is at least 10(3)-fold more active than DesVII alone. The
   formation of the DesVII/DesVIII complex requires coexpression of both
   genes in vivo and cannot be fully achieved by mixing the individual
   protein components in vitro. The ability of the DesVII/DesVIII system to
   catalyze the reverse reaction with the formation of TDP-desosamine was
   also demonstrated in a transglycosylation experiment. Taken together,
   our data suggest that DesVIII assists the folding of DesVII during
   protein production and remains tightly bound during catalysis. This
   requirement must be taken into consideration in the design of
   combinatorial biosynthetic experiments with new glycosylated macrolides.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a theoretical study of the surface structures and
   thermodynamic stability of different thiol and sulfide structures
   present on the palladium surface as a function of the chemical potential
   of the thiol species It has been found that as the chemical potential of
   the thiol is increased, the initially clean palladium surface is covered
   by a (root 3 x root 3)R3 degrees sulfur lattice Further increase in the
   thiol pressure or concentration leads to the formation of a denser (root
   7 x root 7)R19 1 degrees sulfur lattice, which finally undergoes a phase
   transition to form a complex (root 7 x root 7) R19 1 degrees sulfur
   thiol adlayer (3/7 sulfur + 2/7 thiol coverage). This transition is
   accompanied by a strong reconstiuction of the Pd(111) surface The
   formation of these surface structures has been explained in terms of the
   catalytic pi perms of the palladium surface These results have been
   compared with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results obtained for
   thiols adsorbed on different palladium surfaces}},

Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{We propose a general approach for the construction of modified gravity
   which is invariant under foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms. Special
   attention is paid to the formulation of a modified F(R) Horava-Lifshitz
   gravity (FRHL), whose Hamiltonian structure is studied. It is
   demonstrated that the spatially flat FRW equations of FRHL are
   consistent with the constraint equations. The analysis of de Sitter
   solutions for several versions of FRHL indicates that the unification of
   the early-time inflation with the late-time acceleration is possible. It
   is shown that a special choice of parameters for FRHL leads to the same
   spatially flat FRW equations as in the case of the traditional
   F(R)gravity. Finally, an essentially most general modified
   Horava-Lifshitz gravity is proposed, motivated by its fully
   diffeomorphism-invariant counterpart, with the restriction that the
   action does not contain derivatives higher than the second order with
   respect to the time coordinate.}},

Abstract = {{Both treatment of disease and basic studies of complex tissues can
   benefit from directing viral vector infection to specific cell types. We
   have used a unique cell targeting method to direct viral vector
   transduction to cerebral cortical neurons expressing the neuregulin
   (NRG) receptor ErbB4; both NRG and ErbB4 have been implicated in
   schizophrenia, and ErbB4 expression in cerebral cortex is known to be
   restricted to inhibitory neurons. We find that a bridge protein composed
   of the avian viral receptor TVB fused to NRG, along with
   EnvB-psuedotyped virus, is able to direct infection selectively to
   ErbB4-expressing inhibitory cortical neurons in vivo. Interestingly,
   although ErbB4 is expressed in a broad range of cortical inhibitory cell
   types, NRG-dependent infection is restricted to a more selective subset
   of inhibitory cell types. These results demonstrate a tool that can be
   used for further studies of NRG and ErbB receptors in brain circuits and
   demonstrate the feasibility for further development of related bridge
   proteins to target gene expression to other specific cell types in

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{We have measured the running coupling constant of SU(3) gauge theory
   coupled to N-f = 2 flavors of symmetric representation fermions, using
   the Schrodinger functional scheme. Our lattice action is defined with
   hypercubic smeared links which, along with the larger lattice sizes,
   bring us closer to the continuum limit than in our previous study. We
   observe that the coupling runs more slowly than predicted by asymptotic
   freedom, but we are unable to observe fixed point behavior before
   encountering a first order transition to a strong coupling phase. This
   indicates that the infrared fixed point found with the thin-link action
   is a lattice artifact. The slow running of the gauge coupling permits an
   accurate determination of the mass anomalous dimension for this theory,
   which we observe to be small, gamma(m) less than or similar to 0.6, over
   the range of couplings we can reach. We also study the bulk and
   finite-temperature phase transitions in the strong coupling region.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetostrictive microcantilever (MSMC). as a high-performance biosensor
   platform. was introduced recently By using physical absorption, an
   antibody against Escherichia con is immobilized onto the surface of the
   MSMC to form a biosensor The real-time and in situ detection of E coli
   in water using the biosensor is reported The responses of the biosensor
   in E coli suspension with different concentrations were studied, which
   were used to determine the detection limit of the biosensor It is
   confirmed by using SEM observation and a control sensor approach,
   respectively, that the experimentally observed response of the biosensor
   is clue to the binding of E cob on the surface oldie biosensor It is
   found that the detection limit is improved by reducing the size of the
   MSMC, which is consistent with the theoretical calculation For an MSMC
   with the size of 15 mm x 08 mm x 35 mu m, the detection limit is 10(5)

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of the torsional rigidity of a semiflexible
   chain on the wrapping transition around a spherical core, as a model of
   a nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin. Through molecular
   dynamics simulation, we show that the torsional effect has a crucial
   effect on the chain wrapping around the core under the topological
   constraints. In particular, the torsional stress (i) induces the
   wrapping/unwrapping transition, and (ii) leads to a unique complex
   structure with an antagonistic wrapping direction which never appears
   without the topological constraints. We further examine the effect of
   the stretching stress for the nucleosome model in relation to the unique
   characteristic effect of the torsional stress on the manner of wrapping.}},

   Rotation of dM1 stars}},

Abstract = {{We have measured v sin i for a selected sample of dM1-type stars. We
   give 114 measurements of v sin i for 88 different stars, and six upper
   detection limits. These are the first measurements of v sin i for most
   of the stars studied here. This represents the largest sample of v sin i
   measurements for M dwarfs at a given spectral type. For these
   measurements, we used four different spectrographs: HARPS (ESO), SOPHIE
   (OHP), ELODIE (OHP) and UVES (ESO). Two of these spectrographs (HARPS
   and SOPHIE) are particularly stable in wavelength since they were
   designed for exoplanet searches. We measured v sin i down to an accuracy
   of 0.3 km s(-1) for the highest resolution spectrographs and a detection
   limit of about 1 km s(-1).
   We show that this unprecedented accuracy for M dwarfs in our data set is
   possible because all the targets have the same spectral type. This is an
   advantage and it facilitates the determination of the narrowest line
   profiles for v sin i similar to 0. Although it is possible to derive the
   zero-point profiles using several spectral types at a time. These values
   were combined with other measurements taken from the literature. The
   total sample represents detected rotation for 100 stars (10 dM1e and 90
   dM1 stars). We confirm our finding of Paper VII that the distribution of
   the projected rotation period is bimodal for dM1 stars with a much
   larger sample, i. e. there are two groups of stars: the fast rotators
   with P/sin i similar to 4.5 d and the slow rotators with P/sin i similar
   to 14.4 d. There is a gap between these two groups. We find that the
   distribution of stars as a function of P/sin i has two very abrupt cuts,
   below 10 d and above 18 d. There are very few stars observed out of this
   range 10-18 d. We also observe that the distribution increases slightly
   from 18 to 10 d.
   We find that the M1 subdwarfs (very low metallicity dwarfs) rotate with
   an average period of P/sin i similar to 7.2 d, which is about twice
   faster as the main group of normal M1 dwarfs. We also find a correlation
   for P/sin i to decrease with stellar radius among dM1e stars. Such a
   trend is also observed in dM1 stars. We also derive metallicity and
   radius for all our target stars using the same method as in Paper VII.
   We notably found that 11 of our target stars are subdwarfs with
   metallicities below -0.5 dex.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations in PARK2/Parkin, which encodes a ubiquitin E3 ligase, cause
   autosomal recessive Parkinson disease (PD). Here we show that the
   nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl phosphorylates tyrosine 143 of parkin,
   inhibiting parkin's ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and protective
   function. c-Abl is activated by dopaminergic stress and by dopaminergic
   neurotoxins, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in vitro and in vivo by
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), leading to parkin
   inactivation, accumulation of the parkin substrates aminoacyl-tRNA
   synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein type 2 (AIMP2)
   (p38/JTV-1) and fuse-binding protein 1 (FBP1), and cell death. STI-571,
   a c-Abl-family kinase inhibitor, prevents the phosphorylation of parkin,
   maintaining parkin in a catalytically active and protective state.
   STI-571's protective effects require parkin, as shRNA knockdown of
   parkin prevents STI-571 protection. Conditional knockout of c-Abl in the
   nervous system also prevents the phosphorylation of parkin, the
   accumulation of its substrates, and subsequent neurotoxicity in response
   to MPTP intoxication. In human postmortem PD brain, c-Abl is active,
   parkin is tyrosine-phosphorylated, and AIMP2 and FBP1 accumulate in the
   substantia nigra and striatum. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of parkin
   by c-Abl is a major post-translational modification that inhibits parkin
   function, possibly contributing to pathogenesis of sporadic PD.
   Moreover, inhibition of c-Abl may be a neuroprotective approach in the
   treatment of PD.}},

Abstract = {{Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) contains as much carbon as the
   Earth's atmosphere, and represents a critical component of the global
   carbon cycle. To better define microbial processes and activities
   associated with marine DOM cycling, we analyzed genomic and
   transcriptional responses of microbial communities to
   high-molecular-weight DOM (HMWDOM) addition. The cell density in the
   unamended control remained constant, with very few transcript categories
   exhibiting significant differences over time. In contrast, the
   DOM-amended microcosm doubled in cell numbers over 27 h, and a variety
   of HMWDOM-stimulated transcripts from different taxa were observed at
   all time points measured relative to the control. Transcripts
   significantly enriched in the HMWDOM treatment included those associated
   with two-component sensor systems, phosphate and nitrogen assimilation,
   chemotaxis, and motility. Transcripts from Idiomarina and Alteromonas
   spp., the most highly represented taxa at the early time points,
   included those encoding TonB-associated transporters, nitrogen
   assimilation genes, fatty acid catabolism genes, and TCA cycle enzymes.
   At the final time point, Methylophaga rRNA and non-rRNA transcripts
   dominated the HMWDOM-amended microcosm, and included gene transcripts
   associated with both assimilatory and dissimilatory single-carbon
   compound utilization. The data indicated specific resource partitioning
   of DOM by different bacterial species, which results in a temporal
   succession of taxa, metabolic pathways, and chemical transformations
   associated with HMWDOM turnover. These findings suggest that
   coordinated, cooperative activities of a variety of bacterial
   ``specialists{''} may be critical in the cycling of marine DOM,
   emphasizing the importance of microbial community dynamics in the global
   carbon cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism leading to protein-primed DNA replication has been studied
   extensively in vitro. However, little is known about the in vivo
   organization of the proteins involved in this fundamental process. Here
   we show that the terminal proteins (TPs) of phages phi 29 and PRD1,
   infecting the distantly related bacteria Bacillus subtilis and
   Escherichia coli, respectively, associate with the host bacterial
   nucleoid independently of other viral-encoded proteins. Analyses of
   phage phi 29 revealed that the TP N-terminal domain (residues 1-73)
   possesses sequence-independent DNA-binding capacity and is responsible
   for its nucleoid association. Importantly, we show that in the absence
   of the TP N-terminaldomain the efficiency of phi 29 DNA replication is
   severely affected. Moreover, the TP recruits the phage DNA polymerase to
   the bacterial nucleoid, and both proteins later are redistributed to
   enlarged helix-like structures in an MreB cytoskeleton-dependent way.
   These data disclose a key function for the TP in vivo: organizing the
   early viral DNA replication machinery at the cell nucleoid.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Quantification of the complex, autonomic networks in the
   skin is difficult. Although sporadic attempts focusing mainly on
   sudomotor plexus have been reported, an easy and reliable method of
   quantification has not yet been made available. We developed a method to
   quantify pilomotor nerve fibers (PNFs), which, compared to sudomotor
   nerves, have a less complex pattern. We used this procedure on a
   population of normal and diabetic subjects, and propose it as a new tool
   to study cutaneous autonomic nerves.
   Methods: Skin biopsies were performed from thigh and distal leg in 20
   diabetic patients and 20 age- and sex-matched controls. Samples were
   processed applying indirect immunofluorescence and using pan-neuronal
   and selective markers for cholinergic and noradrenergic fibers.
   Pilomotor nerve fiber density was blindly calculated on single 2-mu m
   optical sections selected from confocal z-stacks. Interobserver and
   intraobserver reliability was evaluated. Results were compared with
   values obtained by 2 other methods that explored PNFs more extensively.
   Pilomotor nerve fibers density was compared to epidermal nerve fiber
   (ENF) density, to pilocarpine-activated sweat gland density, and to the
   severity of neuropathy as assessed by the modified total neuropathy
   score.
   Results: A significant loss of PNFs was found in diabetic subjects'
   thigh and leg. PNFs density did not correlate with ENF density, disease
   duration, or total neuropathy score. Noradrenergic PNFs correlated
   instead with sweating impairment.
   Conclusions: A reliable assessment of PNF density is possible. When
   studying cutaneous innervation, PNF quantification should be done to
   gain information on autonomic nerves in addition to somatic nerves.

Abstract = {{We use the radio plasma imager (RPI) on the IMAGE satellite to
   investigate the impedance characteristics of an active electric antenna
   in space plasma at whistler mode frequencies. A dedicated experiment was
   carried out on 21-22 September 2005 for two orbits in the plasmasphere.
   The input impedance characteristics of the dipole antenna submerged in
   plasma is determined at whistler frequencies. The results are consistent
   with a physical model in which the antenna is negatively charged to a
   large voltage and the plasma around each antenna element forms an ion
   sheath that varies with time in its radius. Within the plasmasphere,
   these sheaths are a part of the antenna-plasma system and represent a
   capacitive component of the tuned antenna circuit. It is shown that,
   inside the plasmasphere, the RPI antenna capacitance varied from 430 to
   480 pF. The plasma sheath formed around the antenna in the plasmasphere
   increases its capacitance by 20\%-30\% with respect to the near-free
   space capacitance (364 pF). Comparison of these values to model
   calculations shows good agreement with a difference smaller than 5\%.
   Measurements of the antenna input resistance showed that, inside the
   plasmasphere, its value was between 200 and 500 Omega, varying
   considerably with changes in the ambient electron density and cyclotron
   frequency. The measured antenna input resistance is compared to model
   calculations.}},

Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy is commonly used for the optical characterization of
   structural properties of SiGe alloys but a measurement of the Raman
   efficiency as a function of excitation wavelength and concentration is
   still lacking. This information is nevertheless important for the
   interpretation of data, especially for the analysis of inhomogeneous
   samples. In this work, the relative Raman efficiency of Si(1-x)Ge(x)
   alloys has been obtained for several excitation energies as a function
   of the composition x with steps of Delta(x) similar to 0.02 across the
   whole composition range. We observed resonances in correspondence of the
   E(1)/E(1)+Delta(1) and E(0)/E(0)+Delta(0) transitions. For a fixed
   excitation energy the efficiency varies of about 2 orders of magnitude
   vs the composition of the alloy, while, for a fixed composition, we
   observed a change in efficiency of up to 3 orders of magnitude depending
   on the excitation energy. The maximum scattering efficiency at resonance
   decreases by an order of magnitude when moving from silicon-rich to
   germanium-rich alloys. The data are discussed in terms of the
   polarizability and compared to the literature relative to pure silicon
   and germanium. The data reported in this paper can be used to design
   experiments under resonant conditions to selectively probe different
   regions in inhomogeneous samples.}},

Abstract = {{AIM To investigate the association between Ser326Cys human oxoguanine
   glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) polymorphism and atrophic gastritis and gastric
   cancer after Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) eradication
   METHODS A total of 488 subjects (73 patients with gastric cancer, 160
   with atrophic gastritis after H pylori eradication and 255 controls)
   were prospectively collected Polymerase chain reaction-restriction
   fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed to distinguish hOGG1
   Ser326Cys polymorphism Statistical analysis was conducted by two-sample
   t test for continuous variables and chi(2) test for categorical
   variables Logistic regression models were used to find the risk factors
   for gastric cancer and atrophic gastritis
   RESULTS Neither the hOGG1 Ser/Cys nor the Cys/Cys genotype was
   associated with gastric cancer Compared with the Ser/Ser genotype, odds
   ratio (OR) for Ser/Cys was 0 96, (95\% CI 0 51-1 84) and OR for Cys/Cys
   was 1 1 (95\% CI 0 48-2 1) No association was detected between hOGG1
   polymorphism and Lauren type of gastric cancer (P = 0 61) either
   However, Ser/Cys and Cys/Cys were significantly associated with atrophic
   gastritis with OR 1 76 for Ser/Cys (95\% CI 1 03-3 0) and 2 38 for
   Cys/Cys (95\% CI 1 34-4 23) After controlling for age, gender, smoking
   and alcohol, there were still significant associations with OR 2 05 for
   Ser/Cys (95\% CI 1 14-3 68) and 2 76 for Cys/Cys (95\% CI 1 47-5 18)
   CONCLUSION HOGG1 polymorphisms (Cys/Cys and Ser/Cys) are associated with
   atrophic gastritis No significant association is detected between hOGG1

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrated a new convenient route for in situ
   fabrication of well separated small sized WO3 nanoparticles in silica
   spheres, through a predeposition of surfactant encapsulated
   polyoxotungates as tungsten source, and followed by a calcination
   process. In a typical procedure, selected polyoxotungates with different
   charges were enwrapped with dioctadecyldimethylammonium cations through
   electrostatic interaction Elemental analysis, thermogravimetric
   analysis, and spectral characterization confirmed the formation of
   prepared complexes with the anticipated chemical structure The complexes
   were then phase-transferred into aqueous solution that predissolved
   surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and finally incorporated into
   silica spheres through a joint sol-gel reaction with tetraethyl
   orthosilicate in a well dispersed state under the protection of organic
   layer for polyoxotungates from the alkaline reaction condition
   Transmission electron microscopic images illustrated the well dispersed
   WO3 nanoparticles in the size range of ca 2 2 nm in the silica spheres
   after the calcination at 465 degrees C. The sizes of both the silica
   spheres and WO3 nanoparticles could be adjusted independently through
   changing the doping content to a large extent Meanwhile, the doped
   polyoxotungate complexes acted as the template for the mesoporous
   structure in silica spheres after the calcination Along with the
   increase of doping content and surfactant, the mesopore size changed
   little (2 0-2.9 nm), but the specific surface areas increased quite a
   lot Importantly, the WO3-nanoparticle-doped silica spheres displayed an
   interesting photovoltaic property, which is favorable for the
   funtionalization of these nanomaterials.}},

Title = {{Care Seeking Behavior of Chest Symptomatics: A Community Based Study
   Done in South India after the Implementation of the RNTCP}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: With the creation of the Revised National TB Control
   Programme (RNTCP), tuberculosis services have become decentralized and
   more accessible. A 1997 study prior to RNTCP implementation reported
   that most chest symptomatics accessed first private health care
   facilities and a general dissatisfaction with government health
   facilities. The study was repeated post-RNTCP implementation to gain
   insight into the current care seeking behavior of chest symptomatics.
   Methodology: A cross-sectional community-based study carried out between
   March-August 2008 in 4 sites (2 rural {[}R] and 2 urban {[}U]) from the
   same two districts of Chennai and Madurai, southern India, as in the
   1997 study. Six hundred and forty chest symptomatics were identified (R
   314; U 326), and detailed interviews were done for 606 (R311; U295).
   Results: Prevalence of chest symptomatics in the urban and rural areas
   were 2.7\% and 4.9\% respectively (p < 0.01), and was found to increase
   with age (Chi-square for trend, p < 0.01). Longer delays in seeking care
   were seen amongst symptomatics above 45 years of age (p 0.01), and those
   who had taken previous TB treatment (p = 0.05). Overall, 50\% (222/444)
   of the chest symptomatics approached a government health care facility
   first (R 142 (61\%); U 80 (38\%), p = < 0.001). This was significantly
   (p < 0.001) more than were observed in the 1997 study, where only 38.4\%
   approached a government facility first. Sixty two (28\%) of the 222 made
   a second visit to a government facility (R26\%; U31\%), while 17\%
   shifted to a private facility (R14\%; U21\%). Dissatisfaction with the
   health care facility was one of the major reasons expressed.
   Conclusions: It appears that the RNTCP has had an impact in the
   community with regard to the availability and accessibility of TB
   services in government health facilities. However the relatively high
   levels of subsequent shifting to private health facilities calls for
   urgent action to make government facilities more patients friendly with
   quality care facilities in the delivery of RNTCP services.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental stressors often show effects that are delayed in time,
   requiring the use of statistical models that are flexible enough to
   describe the additional time dimension of the exposure-response
   relationship. Here we develop the family of distributed lag non-linear
   models (DLNM), a modelling framework that can simultaneously represent
   non-linear exposure-response dependencies and delayed effects. This
   methodology is based on the definition of a `cross-basis', a
   bi-dimensional space of functions that describes simultaneously the
   shape of the relationship along both the space of the predictor and the
   lag dimension of its occurrence. In this way the approach provides a
   unified framework for a range of models that have previously been used
   in this setting, and new more flexible variants. This family of models
   is implemented in the package dlnm within the statistical environment R.
   To illustrate the methodology we use examples of DLNMs to represent the
   relationship between temperature and mortality, using data from the
   National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) for New
   York during the period 1987-2000. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The black hole (BH)-bulge correlations have greatly influenced the last
   decade of efforts to understand galaxy evolution. Current knowledge of
   these correlations is limited predominantly to high BH masses (M-BH
   greater than or similar to 10(8) M-circle dot) that can be measured
   using direct stellar, gas, and maser kinematics. These objects, however,
   do not represent the demographics of more typical L < L{*} galaxies.
   This study transcends prior limitations to probe BHs that are an order
   of magnitude lower in mass, using BH mass measurements derived from the
   dynamics of H2O megamasers in circumnuclear disks. The masers trace the
   Keplerian rotation of circumnuclear molecular disks starting at radii of
   a few tenths of a pc from the central BH. Modeling of the rotation
   curves, presented by Kuo et al., yields BH masses with exquisite
   precision. We present stellar velocity dispersion measurements for a
   sample of nine megamaser disk galaxies based on long-slit observations
   using the B\&C spectrograph on the Dupont telescope and the Dual Imaging
   Spectrograph on the 3.5 m telescope at Apache Point. We also perform
   bulge-to-disk decomposition of a subset of five of these galaxies with
   Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging. The maser galaxies as a group fall
   below the M-BH-sigma({*}) relation defined by elliptical galaxies. We
   show, now with very precise BH mass measurements, that the low-scatter
   power-law relation between M-BH and sigma({*}) seen in elliptical
   galaxies is not universal. The elliptical galaxy M-BH-sigma{*} relation
   cannot be used to derive the BH mass function at low mass or the zero
   point for active BH masses. The processes (perhaps BH self-regulation or
   minor merging) that operate at higher mass have not effectively
   established an M-BH-sigma{*} relation in this low-mass regime.}},

Title = {{Effect of medical ozone therapy on renal blood flow and renal function

Abstract = {{Background Medical ozone therapy system was reported to have certain
   effects on the treatment of severe hepatitis, but its mechanism is not
   very clear. One of the causes of death of severe hepatitis is
   complication of renal damage or hepatorenal syndrome. The present study
   aimed to observe effects of medical ozone therapy system on plasma renin
   activity (PRA), angiotensin II (All), aldosterone (ALD), renal blood
   flow and renal function of patients with chronic severe hepatitis and
   explore mechanisms of medical ozone therapy in the treatment of severe
   hepatitis.
   Methods Eighty-five cases with chronic severe hepatitis were randomly
   divided into ozone therapy group (43 cases) and control group (42
   cases). The patients in the ozone therapy group were treated with basic
   treatments plus ozone therapy system. Basic autohemotherapy was used.
   One hundred milliliter venous blood was drawn from each patient, and was
   mixed with 100 ml (35 mu g/ml) medical ozone and then was returned the
   blood to the patient intravenously, once every other day for 20 days.
   Only the basic treatments were given to the control group. PRA, All,
   ALD, renal blood flow and damage to renal function of the two groups
   before treatment and 20 days after treatment were compared. Survival
   rates were also compared.
   Results Twenty days after the treatment, in ozone therapy group, PRA was
   (1.31+/-0.12) ng.ml(-1).h(-1), All (111.25+/-17.35) pg/ml, ALD
   (251.31+/-22.60) pg/ml, which decreased significantly compared with
   those before treatment (PRA (2.23+/-0.13) ng.m(-1).h(-1), All
   (155.18+/-19.13) pg/ml, ALD (405.31+/-29.88) pg/ml, t=4.67-14.23,
   P<0.01), also lower than those of control group 20 days after the
   treatment (PRA (2.02+/-0.11) ng.m(-1).h(-1), All (162.21+/-15.32) pg/ml,
   ALD (401.20+/-35.02) pg/ml, t=4.97-15.61, P<0.01); renal blood flow was
   (175.15+/-28.20) ml/min, which increased compared with that before the
   treatment ((125.68+/-21.25) ml/min) and was higher than that of control
   group 20 days after the treatment ((128.59+/-23.15) ml/min, t=4.78,
   4.61, P<0.01). Renal damage occurred in 2 cases (5\%) in ozone therapy
   group, less than that in control group (9 cases, 21\%) (chi(2)=5.295,
   P<0.05). Thirty-three cases (77\%) in ozone therapy group vs. 16 cases
   (38\%) in control group survived (chi(2)=12.993, P<0.01).
   Conclusions Basic treatment plus medical ozone therapy for patients with
   chronic severe hepatitis could decrease PRA, All and ALD levels
   significantly increase renal blood flow, prevent renal damage to certain
   extent and improve survival rate of the patients. Chin Med J

Abstract = {{An increased heart rate is considered a cardiovascular risk factor. A
   reduction in heart rate to 55-60 beats/minute is recommended for the
   treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris. Ivabradine is a drug which
   reduces the heart rate by inhibiting the I-f channel in the sinus node
   and by reducing the slope of the diastolic depolarization. The blood
   pressure is not affected. During treatment with ivabradine, there is no
   negative influence on metabolism, as can often be seen in treatment with
   betablockers. Ivabradine showed anti-anginal effects in pre-clinical
   studies, which were comparable to those of betablockers or calcium
   channel blockers. In controlled studies, the addition of therapy with
   ivabradine to standard therapy reduced angina pectoris and the number of
   myocardial infarctions, particularly if heart rate was >= 70
   beats/minute. In patients with angina on exertion, the additional
   treatment with ivabradine was associated with reduced mortality. In
   summary, treatment with ivabradine bears a new potential for the therapy
   of angina pectoris. This potential is not being fully utilized as yet.}},

Abstract = {{Background Although the migration of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is
   essential for hepatic fibrotic response, the detailed mechanisms
   involved are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine the
   role of Rho GTPases (especially RhoA) in platelet-derived growth factor
   (PDGF)-BB-induced migration of HSCs.
   Methods The migration of primary rat HSCs was evaluated using transwell
   Boyden chamber, while cytoskeletal changes were visualized by
   immunofluorescence staining of intracellular actins and vinculin.
   Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting analysis were used to
   detect the expression of Rho GTPases (RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42) within HSCs
   and their activation was determined by glutathione S-transferase
   pull-down assay. Finally, the effects of RhoA on PDGF-BB-induced cell
   migration and cytoskeletal remodeling were analyzed using HSC-T6 cells
   stably transfected with constitutively active (CA, Q63L) or dominant
   negative (DN, T19N) RhoA mutants. Data were analyzed using SPSS 16.0
   software. Student's t test was used to analyze differences between two
   groups and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used among multiple
   groups.
   Results Rapid cytoskeletal remodeling led to a significant increase in
   the motility of primary rat HSCs after haptotactic (direct) and
   chemotactic (indirect) stimulation by PDGF-BB PDGF-BB caused a dramatic
   elevation in the levels of both total and active RhoA protein. However,
   the levels of mRNA for Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, were
   unaffected. Furthermore, PDGF-BB induced increased formation of stress
   fibers and focal adhesions in HSC-T6 cells transfected with CA-RhoA, but
   not in HSC-T6 transfected with DN-RhoA. Surprisingly, both CA- and
   DN-RhoA-transfected HSC-T6 cells showed decreased migratory potential in
   the absence or presence of PDGF-BB compared with controls.
   Conclusions PDGF-BB induced cytoskeletal remodeling in rat HSCs and
   promoted their migration via regulation of intracellular RhoA. RhoA may
   be one of the determinants in PDGF-BB-induced HSC migration. Chin Med J

Abstract = {{Cyclin E is aberrantly expressed in many types of cancer including
   breast cancer. High levels of the full length as well as the low
   molecular weight isoforms of cyclin E are associated with poor prognosis
   of breast cancer patients. Notably, cyclin E overexpression is also
   correlated with triple-negative basal-like breast cancers, which lack
   specific therapeutic targets. In this study, we used siRNA to target
   cyclin E overexpression and assessed its ability to suppress breast
   cancer growth in nude mice. Our results revealed that cyclin E siRNA
   could effectively inhibit overexpression of both full length and low
   molecular weight isoforms of cyclin E. We found that depletion of cyclin
   E promoted apoptosis of cyclin E-overexpressing cells and blocked their
   proliferation and transformation phenotypes. Significantly, we further
   demonstrated that administration of cyclin E siRNA could inhibit breast
   tumor growth in nude mice. In addition, we found that cyclin E siRNA
   synergistically enhanced the cell killing effects of doxorubicin in cell
   culture and this combination greatly suppressed the tumor growth in
   mice. In conclusion, our results indicate that cyclin E, which is
   overexpressed in 30\% of breast cancer, may serve as a novel and
   effective therapeutic target. More importantly, our study clearly
   demonstrates a very promising therapeutic potential of cyclin E siRNA
   for treating the cyclin E-overexpressing breast cancers, including the
   very malignant triple-negative breast cancers.}},

Title = {{Involvement of endogenous opioid system in scorpion toxin-induced

Abstract = {{The present study analyzes the involvement of the endogenous opioid
   system in the antinociceptive effects produced in mammals after alpha-
   or beta- scorpion toxin injections. The analgesic effects on mice of the
   alpha-anatoxin Amm VIII, a weak modulator of Na(v)1.2 channel, and the
   depressant insect-selective beta-toxin LqqIT2 were evaluated by
   intraperitoneal route. The two toxins increased hot plate and tail flick
   latencies in a dose-dependent manner. We also compared the effects of
   the toxins with those obtained after acetic acid administration or
   cold-water tail immersion, which both induce pain relief through the
   activation of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) and the release
   of endogenous opioids. The increased latencies obtained with the toxins,
   acetic acid, or cold-water tail immersion were partly reversed by the
   co-administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Finally,
   AmmVIII, LqqIT2, or acetic acid, induced increased c-fos mRNA expression
   in spinal cord. This increase disappeared when the toxins were
   co-injected with acetic acid. In conclusion, we show for the first time
   that an alpha-anatoxin exhibits a potent analgesic activity and confirm
   that depressant beta-toxins are able to reduce nociception. We
   hypothesize that pain relief induced by these scorpion toxins may
   implicate the activation of an endogenous opioid system and may be
   partly the result of a counter irritation phenomenon, which could be due
   to the activation of DNIC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A combination of a parallel fracture model with the PHREEQC-2
   geochemical model was developed to simulate sequential flow and chemical
   transport with reactions in fractured media where both laminar and
   turbulent flows occur. The integration of non-laminar flow resistances
   in one model produced relevant effects on water flow velocities, thus
   improving model prediction capabilities on contaminant transport. The
   proposed conceptual model consists of 3D rock-blocks, separated by
   horizontal bedding plane fractures with variable apertures. Particle
   tracking solved the transport equations for conservative compounds and
   provided input for PHREEQC-2. For each cluster of contaminant pathways,
   PHREEQC-2 determined the concentration for mass-transfer,
   sorption/desorption, ion exchange, mineral dissolution/precipitation and
   biodegradation, under kinetically controlled reactive processes of
   equilibrated chemical species. Field tests have been performed for the
   code verification. As an example, the combined model has been applied to
   a contaminated fractured aquifer of southern Italy in order to simulate
   the phenol transport. The code correctly fitted the field available data
   and also predicted a possible rapid depletion of phenols as a result of
   an increased biodegradation rate induced by a simulated artificial
   injection of nitrates, upgradient to the sources. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The cellular nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP) is a ubiquitously
   expressed protein involved in regulation of transcription and
   translation. CNBP, and its encoding gene ZNF9, have been shown to be
   involved in type 2 myotonic dystrophy. Both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
   sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) are age-related degenerative
   diseases associated with the accumulation of beta-amyloid.
   Overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in mice has been used
   to generate models of both diseases. We show here that overexpression of
   APP in skeletal muscle from a mouse model of sIBM reduces the expression
   of CNBP significantly. We examined CNBP expression in a brain-specific
   APP-overexpressing strain, and a whole body APP knock-in strain, and
   found that there was a reduction in CNBP expression in tissue expressing
   APP(Swe). We conclude that expression of APP(Swe) in murine tissue
   induces a decrease in CNBP expression. This effect does not appear to be
   due to alterations in CNBP transcription. APP(Swe) expression may
   provide a tool for the study of CNBP regulation and clues to the roles
   of both proteins in disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background Treating intramedullary spinal cord gliomas is a big
   challenge because of limited options, high recurrence rate and poor
   prognosis. An intramedullary glioma model is prerequisite for testing
   new treatments. This paper describes the establishment of a rodent
   intramedullary glioma model and presents functional progression,
   neuroimaging and histopathological characterization of the tumour model.
   Methods Fischer344 rats (n=24) were randomized into two groups. Group 1
   (n=16) received a 5 mu l intramedullary implantation of 9L gliosarcomal
   (10(5)) cells. Group 2 (n=8) received a 5 mu l intramedullary injection
   of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. The rats were anesthetized, the
   spinous process of the T-10 vertebra and the ligamentum flavum were
   removed to expose the T10-11 intervertebral space and an intramedullary
   injection was conducted into the spinal cord. The rats were evaluated
   preoperatively and daily postoperatively for neurological deficits using
   the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scale. High resolution magnetic
   resonance images were acquired preoperatively and weekly
   postoperatively. When score equal to 0, rats were sacrificed for
   histopathological examination.
   Results Rats implanted with 9L gliosarcoma cells had a statistically
   significant median onset of hind limb paraplegia at (16.0+/-0.4) days,
   compared with rats in the control group in which neurological deficits
   were absent. Imaging and pathological cross sections confirmed
   intramedullary 9L gliosarcoma invading the spinal cord. Rats in the
   control group showed no significant functional, radiological or
   histopathological findings of tumour.
   Conclusions Rats implanted with 9L cells regularly develop paraplegia in
   a reliable and reproducible manner. The progression of neurological
   deficits, neuroimaging and histopathological characteristics of
   intramedullary spinal cord gliomas in rats is comparable with the
   behaviour of infiltrative intramedullary spinal cord gliomas in
   patients. Chin Med J 2010;123(18):2580-2585}},

Abstract = {{Sarpagandha Rauvolfia serpentina Benth) is grown in different parts of
   India and its adjoining countries for its root which is the chief source
   of several important alkaloids like ajmalicine, ajmaline, isoajmaline,
   rauvolfinine, reserpine and serpentine. Blossom blight caused by
   Colletotrichum capsici is one of the most serious diseases of
   sarpagandha in the North Indian plains. Eight fungicides, namely
   Benomyl, Carbendazim, Chlorothalonil, Mancozeb, Metalaxyl-mancozeb,
   Propiconazole, Thiram and Thiophanate-methyl were evaluated against the
   spore germination and mycelial growth of Colletotrichum capsici under in
   vitro condition. The results indicated that Mancozeb,
   Metalaxyl-mancozeb, Propiconazole and Thiram inhibited percent spore
   germination at the dose of 2 - 10 mu g/ml, while Benomyl, Carbendazim
   and Thiophanate-Methyl were ineffective even at 250 mu g/ml
   concentration. Propiconazole, Carbendazim, Benomyl, Mancozeb and
   Metalaxyl-mancozeb were highly effective inhibiting 50\% mycelial growth
   at 2.8, 4.6, 6.0, 9.3 and 11.2 mu g/ml, respectively, while
   Thiophanate-methyl, Chlorothalonil and Thiram were relatively less
   effective showing 50\% mycelial growth inhibition at 25.2, 27.2 and 31.3
   mu g/ml, respectively. The effective fungicides were further employed
   for the protection of sarpagandha from blossom blight disease in the
   field during the year 2006 and 2007. The results of the two years (2006
   and 2007) of field experiments indicated that disease incidence was
   significantly reduced in all the treated plots over unsprayed control.
   The spray of Mancozeb and Carbendazim produced highest protection that
   is >80\% in both the years against blossom blight disease and their
   treatments also produced healthy and highest seed yield per plant.}},

Abstract = {{Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are attracting a great deal
   of interest for biosensing and bioelectronics applications. However,
   their device physics is not yet well-understood. In this paper, we focus
   on the effect of the gate electrode material on the response of OECTs.
   We studied OECTs made from the conducting polymer
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate), and
   which utilized halide electrolytes. We demonstrate that OECTs with Ag
   gate electrodes show larger current modulation compared to OECTs with Pt
   gate electrodes. This effect is due to a change in the OECT regime of
   operation from capacitive, in case of a Pt gate electrode, to Faradaic,
   in the case of an Ag electrode. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{The potential application of FT-Raman spectroscopy for the

Abstract = {{Hoodia gordonii, with the perceived active ingredient P57 (a steroidal
   glycoside), is a succulent plant which has gained commercial popularity
   as an anti-obesity preparation. The content of P57 is used as an
   indication of the quality of the raw material. Traditionally,
   quantification of P57 is performed using liquid-chromatography coupled
   to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) which is expensive and laborious.
   Vibrational spectroscopy methods such as FT-Raman spectroscopy offer a
   simple, less expensive and rapid alternative. The potential of FT-Raman
   to quantify and identify the location of P57 in H. gordonii raw plant
   material was investigated. LC-MS was used to determine the concentration
   of P57 in 145 plant samples and the data was used to develop a
   calibration model with chemometric techniques based on the partial least
   squares projections to latent structures (PLS) algorithm. The
   performance of the calibration model was evaluated according to the root
   mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and correlation coefficient
   (R-2). Pre-processing with orthogonal signal correction (OSC) yielded a
   model which predicted P57 content based on the FT-Raman spectra with a
   correlation coefficient (R-2) value of 0.9986 and an RMSEP of 0.004\%.
   These results demonstrate that FT-Raman spectroscopy holds great
   potential to rapidly quantify P57 in H. gordonii raw material with high
   accuracy as an alternative to LC-MS analysis. In addition, the spatial
   distribution of P57 in a cross-section of an H. gordonii stem sample was
   demonstrated using FT-Raman mapping showing that P57 is concentrated
   throughout the cortex which was confirmed with LC-MS. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Background: Poor recognition of physical inactivity may be an important
   barrier to healthy behaviour change, but little is known about this
   phenomenon. We aimed to characterize a high-risk population according to
   the discrepancies between objective and self-rated physical activity
   (PA), defined as awareness.
   Methods: An exploratory cross-sectional analysis of PA awareness using
   baseline data collected from 365 ProActive participants between 2001 and
   2003 in East Anglia, England. Self-rated PA was defined as `active' or
   `inactive' (assessed via questionnaire). Objective PA was defined
   according to achievement of guideline activity levels (>= 30 minutes or
   < 30 minutes spent at least moderate intensity PA, assessed by heart
   rate monitoring). Four awareness groups were created: `Realistic
   Actives', `Realistic Inactives', `Overestimators' and `Underestimators'.
   Logistic regression was used to assess associations between awareness
   group and 17 personal, social and biological correlates.
   Results: 63.3\% of participants (N = 231) were inactive according to
   objective measurement. Of these, 45.9\% rated themselves as active
   ('Overestimators'). In a multiple logistic regression model adjusted for
   age and smoking, males (OR = 2.11, 95\% CI = 1.12, 3.98), those with
   lower BMI (OR = 0.89, 95\% CI = 0.84, 0.95), younger age at completion
   of full-time education (OR = 0.83, 95\% CI = 0.74, 0.93) and higher
   general health perception (OR = 1.02 CI = 1.00, 1.04) were more likely
   to overestimate their PA.
   Conclusions: Overestimation of PA is associated with favourable
   indicators of relative slimness and general health. Feedback about PA
   levels could help reverse misperceptions.}},

Title = {{An alternative approach to probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in the
   Aegean region using Monte Carlo simulation}},

Abstract = {{The Aegean is the most seismically active and tectonically complex
   region in Europe. Damaging earthquakes have occurred here throughout
   recorded history, often resulting in considerable loss of life. The
   Monte Carlo method of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) is
   used to determine the level of ground motion likely to be exceeded in a
   given time period. Multiple random simulations of seismicity are
   generated to calculate, directly, the ground motion for a given site.
   Within the seismic hazard analysis we explore the impact of different
   seismic source models, incorporating both uniform zones and distributed
   seismicity. A new, simplified, seismic source model, derived from
   seismotectonic interpretation, is presented for the Aegean region. This
   is combined into the epistemic uncertainty analysis alongside existing
   source models for the region, and models derived by a K-means cluster
   analysis approach. Seismic source models derived using the K-means
   approach offer a degree of objectivity and reproducibility into the
   otherwise subjective approach of delineating seismic sources using
   expert judgment. Similar review and analysis is undertaken for the
   selection of peak ground acceleration (PGA) attenuation models,
   incorporating into the epistemic analysis Greek-specific models,
   European models and a Next Generation Attenuation model. Hazard maps for
   PGA on a ``rock{''} site with a 10\% probability of being exceeded in 50
   years are produced and different source and attenuation models are
   compared. These indicate that Greek-specific attenuation models, with
   their smaller aleatory variability terms, produce lower PGA hazard,
   whilst recent European models and Next Generation Attenuation (NGA)
   model produce similar results. The Monte Carlo method is extended
   further to assimilate epistemic uncertainty into the hazard calculation,
   thus integrating across several appropriate source and PGA attenuation
   models. Site condition and fault-type are also integrated into the
   hazard mapping calculations. These hazard maps are in general agreement
   with previous maps for the Aegean, recognising the highest hazard in the
   Ionian Islands, Gulf of Corinth and Hellenic Arc. Peak Ground
   Accelerations for some sites in these regions reach as high as 500-600
   cm s(-2) using European/NGA attenuation models, and 400-500 cm s(-2)
   using Greek attenuation models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background Target-controlled infusion (TCI) has been recently developed
   and successfully implemented in clinical practice. The current study was
   to estimate the population pharmacokinetics of rocuronium TCI in adult
   patients using nonlinear mixed-effects model (NONMEM), and to
   investigate the influence of relevant factors in adult patients.
   Methods Fourteen ASA I-II patients undergoing elective laparoscopy
   operation with general anesthesia were included. After induction, all
   patients received rocuronium by TCI system. The beginning target plasma
   concentration (Cpt) was 2.0 mu g/ml, then increased Cpt according to the
   neuromuscular transmission monitoring. The endpoint of Cpt was
   determined when the T-1 scale was blocked by 90\%-95\%. TCI rocuronium
   was stopped 30 minutes before the end of the operation. Arterial blood
   was drawn before anesthesia at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60,
   120, 180, 240 and 360 minutes after the infusion of rocuronium was
   stopped for the analysis of plasma concentrations of rocuronium by
   liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
   The population pharmacokinetics analysis was performed using NONMEM
   program.
   Results The pharmacokinetics of TCI rocuronium in adult patients was
   best described by a three-comparment model. Pharmacokintic parameters
   were clearance (CL)(1)=0.205 L/min, CL2=0.324 L/min, CL3=0.0292 L/min,
   volumes of distribution (V)(1)=4.00 L, V-2=2.28 L, V-3=4.26 L,
   Vdss=10.54 L. Both age and weight as covariates affected the
   pharmacokinetic parameters. V-1 and CL1 were negatively correlated with
   patient age. CL1 was positively correlated with weight.
   Conclusions No pharmacokinetic change was noted when rocuronium was
   administered via TCI. Both age and weight as covariates affected the
   pharmacokinetic parameters. Chin Med J 2010;123(18):2543-2547}},

Abstract = {{Knowing and learning the values and meanings of historical environments
   and determining the cultural riches and keeping them alive in order to
   preserve these environments are very important for cultural continuity.
   In order to do this, first of all, such physical elements as documents
   with historical characteristics must be analyzed and evaluated. To this
   end, the center of Surmene district of the city Trabzon in the Eastern
   Black Sea region was chosen as the field of work due to the fact that
   the centre has the best timber construction materials that have come
   down to the present day. The traditional houses in the Eastern Black Sea
   Region differ from those in other regions in terms of different uses of
   timber construction materials. From their masonry systems to their
   framing systems, the traditional Surmene houses are important among
   traditional Eastern Black Sea houses, in that, they use different
   approaches in the details. In order to do this, a total of 35
   traditional houses with the characteristics of traditional Surmene
   houses were investigated in terms of material-form relationships and its
   effects on the fa ades. Analyses were made on fa ades, which have the
   most characteristic qualities. The study employed observation, note
   taking and measurement techniques and analyses were made under the
   headings of `use of floors', `load-bearing systems', `roofs', `windows',
   `doors' and `bay windows'. The aim here was to provide data for new
   designs by evaluating and interpreting the data obtained.}},

   households and through in-depth interviews. A higher proportion of
   species common to all four home garden types consisted of food crops:
   vegetables, staples and fruits. In HIV-positive households, commercial
   home gardens were significantly larger, had significantly more species
   and individual plants, more perennial food crops and more species that
   were harvested all year round and evenness was lower, but there was no
   significant difference in species diversity compared with subsistence
   home gardens. Significantly, more HIV-positive and HIV-negative
   households with a commercial home garden consumed a staple crop
   cultivated in the home garden in the 24-h period prior to the survey
   than HIV-positive households with subsistence home gardens. Rural
   households with HIV that manage commercial home gardens cultivate a dual

Abstract = {{In Kenya's dryland districts, gaps in access to productivity-enhancing

   from sampled participants in each of the interventions. A two-stage
   regression model was used to assess the perceived effectiveness of the
   interventions. Results of the analysis showed that access to
   productivity-enhancing resources particularly irrigation, quality seeds,
   fertilizers and markets was patchy and low. Furthermore, access was
   significantly high where complementary resources could be found in a
   single intervention. Conclusively, resource planning should be an
   integral part of every intervention. Towards this end, irrigation and
   markets for credit and produce are critical. Moreover, use of the
   participatory intervention design is recommended in order to foster
   identification of complementary resources, which are relevant for

Abstract = {{A total of 368 ovulations from 92 lactations in 69 cows were analysed to
   determine the effects of timing of ovulation and signs of oestrus on the
   fertility of the cows. During the study period of 10 to 13 weeks
   postpartum, cows ranged from having reached their first ovulation to
   having reached their fifth. Before ovulation, the cows exhibiting
   standing oestrus or mounting activity with other oestrous signs were
   considered to be in oestrus. The total number of anoestrous ovulations
   was 136 (37 per cent). From the second to fifth ovulations, the
   percentage of cows expressing ST increased from 10 to 74 per cent, while
   the percentage of cows with ovulations accompanied by mounting oestrus
   increased from 1 per cent at the first ovulation to 19 to 24 per cent at
   subsequent ovulations. Seventeen relapses to anoestrous ovulation
   occurred in 14 cows that had resumed an oestrous cycle, and sixteen of
   these relapses were observed at the second to fourth ovulations. Cows
   exhibiting first oestrus at the third ovulation had a similar number of
   days open as at the second ovulation, but a significantly fewer number
   of days open than at the first, fourth or fifth ovulations. These
   results can be valuable for studying and improving the reproductive
   performance of high-yielding dairy cows.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic jumps primarily serve to dissipate the excess energy of
   flowing water downstream of hydraulic structures, such as spillways,
   weir, sluice gates etc. This type of jump is of practical importance
   when tail water depth is inadequate to give a good jump. The research
   conducted at the hydraulics laboratory aimed to obtain suitability of
   drop number (D) and an estimated hydraulic jump using the drop number.
   The objective was to obtain the affectivities of application of D on
   vertical drop and sloped drop structures and to develop the model
   equation for the sloped drop structure. The hydraulic laboratory
   conducted research on a hydraulic rectangular flume. Results showed that
   the D equation could predict drop length (L-d), and hydraulic jump
   length (L-j) for vertical drop structures; however, the equation could
   not estimate the hydraulic jump length for sloped drop structure.
   Therefore, development of a D equation that could be used to estimate
   hydraulic jump for sloped drop structures, with analysis of non
   dimensional relationships based on mathematical equations, was needed.
   These equations have correlation regression with a range between 60 -
   87\% and relative error with a range between 5 - 13\%.}},

Abstract = {{The critical values of a power system are the limit values of voltage
   stability. These are: the values of the highest active power that load
   busses can take and the values of voltage amplitude and angle of the

   electric power systems are defined with Simulated Annealing (SA) and
   Tabu Search (TS) algorithms. These algorithms are known as heuristic
   techniques in the literature. The research is executed on a sample of
   6-bus power system. At first, as the load value in a selected load bus
   increased step by step, load flow is executed anytime. This process was
   kept until an unsolvable condition was reached, so critical bus values
   which are limited values of voltage stability were obtained. Secondly,
   using (SA) and (TS) algorithms, without increasing the load on selected
   bus step by step, the critical value was reached directly. It was seen
   that the critical bus values can be obtained easier through (SA) and
   (TS) which are heuristic techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Gravity survey in parts of Akataka and the environs in Abakaliki area of
   the Lower Benue trough was conducted over an area between longitudes 8
   degrees 42' E to 8 degrees 47' E and latitudes 6 degrees 35' N to 6
   degrees 45' N. Ninety eight gravity stations were occupied and the data
   collected were reduced relative to a base station. The geometry of the
   buried body was determined from the interpretation of residual anomaly
   data. Spherical model was assumed for the anomalous body based on the
   local geology and the residual gravity anomaly. A density contrast of
   0.32 gcm(-3) was calculated for the body. The residualized and
   interpreted gravity profiles yielded results that reveal low Bouguer
   gravity anomalies with magnitudes ranging from -2.5 to 3.8 mgals and
   with abrupt changes at intervals thereby suggesting a fault. The
   low-density anomalous body suspected to be salt deposit was buried at
   depths of between 868 and 2618 m. Its diameter ranging between 2,126 and
   3,322 m, mass ranges from 1.18 to 4.52 x 10(13) kg. The low Bouguer
   gravity anomaly over the area suggests a zone of basic to intermediate
   igneous intrusions, deep basement and crustal thinning. These calculated
   values are in agreement with other works carried out within Abakaliki
   areas in particular and the Lower Benue trough in general.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, empirical and analytical solutions of equibiaxial strain
   on a flexible substrate are derived for a dynamic cell culture system.
   The empirical formula, which fulfills the mechanistic conditions of the
   culture system, is based on a regression analysis from finite element
   analyses for a substrate undergoing large strains (<15\%). The
   analytical (closed-form) solution is derived from the super-position of
   two elastic responses induced in the equibiaxial strain culture system
   after applying pressure to a substrate undergoing small strains
   (microstrains). There is good agreement between the strain predicted
   from the solutions and from the direct measurement. Using material and
   geometric properties of the culture system, the solutions developed here
   are straightforward and can be used to circumvent experimental
   measurements or finite element analysis to establish substrate
   pressure-strain relationships. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Associating musculoskeletal models to motion analysis data enables the

   studied the advantages and drawbacks of each one, we present the convex
   wrapping algorithm. Its purpose is to identify the shortest path from
   the origin to the insertion of a muscle wrapping over the underlying
   skeleton mesh while respecting possible non-sliding constraints. After
   the presentation of the algorithm, the results obtained are compared to
   a classically used wrapping surface algorithm (obstacle set method) by
   measuring the length and moment arm of the semitendinosus muscle during
   an asymptomatic gait. The convex wrapping algorithm gives an efficient
   and realistic way of identifying the muscular paths with respect to the
   underlying bones mesh without the need to define simplified geometric
   forms. It also enables the identification of the centroid path of the
   muscles if their thickness evolution function is known. All this
   presents a particular interest when studying populations presenting
   noticeable bone deformations, such as those observed in cerebral palsy
   or rheumatic pathologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is complicated by pro-oxidant intraneuronal
   Fe2+ elevation as well as extracellular Zn2+ accumulation within amyloid
   plaque. We found that the AD beta-amyloid protein precursor (APP)
   possesses ferroxidase activity mediated by a conserved H-ferritin-like
   active site, which is inhibited specifically by Zn2+. Like
   ceruloplasmin, APP catalytically oxidizes Fe2+, loads Fe3+ into
   transferrin, and has a major interaction with ferroportin in HEK293T
   cells (that lack ceruloplasmin) and in human cortical tissue. Ablation
   of APP in HEK293T cells and primary neurons induces marked iron
   retention, whereas increasing APP695 promotes iron export. Unlike normal
   mice, APP(-/-) mice are vulnerable to dietary iron exposure, which
   causes Fe2+ accumulation and oxidative stress in cortical neurons.
   Paralleling iron accumulation, APP ferroxidase activity in AD postmortem
   neocortex is inhibited by endogenous Zn2+, which we demonstrate can
   originate from Zn2+-laden amyloid aggregates and correlates with A beta
   burden. Abnormal exchange of cortical zinc may link amyloid pathology
   with neuronal iron accumulation in AD.}},

Abstract = {{Can the center of mass (COM) motion state, i.e., its position and
   velocity relative to the base of support (BOS), which dictate gait
   stability, be predictably controlled by the global gait parameters of
   step length and gait speed, or by extension, cadence? The precise
   relationships among step length and gait speed, and the COM motion state
   are unknown, partially due to the interdependence between step length
   and gait speed and the difficulty in independent control of both
   parameters during spontaneous level walking. The purposes of this study
   were to utilize simultaneous audio-visual cuing to independently
   manipulate step length and gait speed, and to determine the extent to
   which the COM position and velocity can be subsequently controlled.
   Fifty-six young adults were trained at one of the three gait patterns in
   which both the step length and gait speed were targeted simultaneously.
   The results showed that the cuing could successfully ``decouple{''} gait
   speed from step length. Although this approach did yield reliable
   control of the COM velocity through manipulation of gait speed (R-2 =
   0.97), the manipulation of step length yielded less precise control of
   COM position (R-2 = 0.60). This latter control appears to require
   manipulation of an additional degree-of-freedom at the local segment
   level, such that the inclusion of trunk inclination with step length
   improved the prediction of COM position (R-2 = 0.80). (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{`Rumours' and clinical trials: a retrospective examination of a
   paediatric malnutrition study in Zambia, southern Africa}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many public health researchers conducting studies in
   resource-constrained settings have experienced negative `rumours' about
   their work; in some cases they have been reported to create serious
   challenges and derail studies. However, what may appear superficially as
   `gossip' or `rumours' can also be regarded and understood as metaphors
   which represent local concerns. For researchers unaccustomed to having
   concerns expressed from participants in this manner, possible reactions
   can be to be unduly perturbed or conversely dismissive. This paper
   represents a retrospective examination of a malnutrition study conducted
   by an international team of researchers in Zambia, Southern Africa. The
   fears of mothers whose children were involved in the study and some of
   the concerns which were expressed as rumours are also presented. This
   paper argues that there is an underlying logic to these anxieties and to
   dismiss them simply as `rumours' or `gossip' would be to overlook the
   historic and socio-economic factors which have contributed to their
   production.
   Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with the mothers whose
   children were involved in the study and with the research nurses. Twenty
   five face-to-face interviews and 2 focus group discussions (FGDs) were
   conducted with mothers. In addition, face-to-face interviews were
   conducted with research nurses participating in the trial.
   Results: A prominent anxiety expressed as rumours by the mothers whose
   children were involved in the study was that recruitment into the trial
   was an indicator that the child was HIV-infected. Other anxieties
   included that the trial was a disguise for witchcraft or Satanism and
   that the children's body parts would be removed and sold. In addition,
   the liquid, milk-based food given to the children to improve their
   nutrition was suspected of being insufficiently nutritious, thus
   worsening their condition. The form which these anxieties took, such as
   rumours related to the stealing of body parts and other anxieties about
   a stigmatised condition, provide an insight into the historical,
   socio-economic and cultural influences in such settings.
   Conclusions: Employing strategies to understand local concerns should
   accompany research aims to achieve optimal success. The concerns raised
   by the participants we interviewed are not unique to this study. They
   are produced in countries where the historic, socio-economic and
   cultural settings communicate anxieties in this format. By examining
   this study we have shown that by contextualizing these `rumours', the
   concerns they express can be constructively addressed and in turn result
   in the successful conduct of research aims.}},

Pages = {{2618-2624}},

Abstract = {{Previous deterministic finger biomechanical models predicted that the
   flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) was silent and the flexor digitorum
   profundus (FDP) was the only active flexor during finger flexion.
   Experimental studies in vivo, however, recorded activities of both
   flexors. In this study, in an attempt to elucidate the roles of the
   flexors, a probabilistic biodynamic model of the index finger was
   constructed to estimate the muscle-tendon forces during an
   experimentally measured index finger flexion movement.
   A Monte-Carlo simulation was performed with four model parameters,
   including moment arms, physiological cross sectional areas (PCSA),
   passive torques, and anthropometric measures as independent random
   variables. The muscle-tendon forces at each time point were determined
   using a nonlinear optimization technique. The model predicted that both
   FDS and FDP contributed to sustaining the movement and the FDS was not
   necessarily silent. The two distinct force patterns observed in vivo in
   experimental studies were also corroborated by the simulation. These
   findings, contrary to previous deterministic models' predictions but in
   agreement with experimental measurements, explained the observed
   coactivation of FDS and FDP, and resolved the controversy regarding the
   roles of the flexors in finger movement dynamics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   their surface, allowing them to react to a corresponding variety of
   extracellular stimuli. Cross-regulation between different ligand-GPCR
   pairs is essential to generate appropriate physiological responses.
   GPCRs can physically affect each other's functioning by forming
   heteromeric complexes, whereas cross-regulation between activated GPCRs
   also occurs through integration of shared intracellular signaling
   networks. Human herpesviruses utilize virally encoded GPCRs to hijack
   cellular signaling networks for their own benefit. Previously, we
   demonstrated that the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded GPCR BILF1 forms
   heterodimeric complexes with human chemokine receptors. Using a
   combination of bimolecular complementation and bioluminescence resonance
   energy transfer approaches, we now show the formation of
   hetero-oligomeric complexes between this viral GPCR and human CXCR4.
   BILF1 impaired CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 and, consequently, also
   CXCL12-induced signaling. In contrast, the G protein uncoupled mutant
   BILF1-K(3.50)A affected CXCL12-induced CXCR4 signaling to a much lesser
   extent, indicating that BILF1-mediated CXCR4 inhibition is a consequence
   of its constitutive activity. Co-expression of G alpha(i1) with BILF1
   and CXCR4 restored CXCL12-induced signaling. Likewise, BILF1 formed
   heteromers with the human histamine H-4 receptor (H4R). BILF1 inhibited
   histamine-induced G alpha(i)-mediated signaling by H4R, however, without
   affecting histamine binding to this receptor. These data indicate that
   functional cross-regulation of G alpha(i)-coupled GPCRs by BILF1 is at
   the level of G proteins, even though these GPCRs are assembled in
   hetero-oligomeric complexes.}},

Abstract = {{Two nanosegregating siloxane-terminated mesogens with chiral (S,
   S)-2,3-epoxyoctyloxy side chains (E6, E11 )have been synthesized. These
   compounds form chiral SmA{*} and SmC{*} phases and show an untypical
   behavior of the spontaneous polarization which increases with decreasing
   temperature in a convex manner while the tilt angle saturates. We
   compare these results with results obtained for two similar mesogens
   with chiral (R, R)-2,3-difluorooctyloxy side chains (F6, F11), which
   both show a typical concave curvature with decreasing temperature. A
   theoretical explanation is given for the unexpected temperature
   dependency of the spontaneous polarization. The materials also exhibited
   first-order SmC{*}-SmA{*} phase transitions and hence, very high values
   of the tilt angle. All substances show increased de Vries character in
   the range of 50\%, which is substantially higher than 20\% for the
   nonsiloxane analogs. Furthermore, for the latter materials, second-order
   phase transitions are common, while the siloxane materials exhibit
   first-order SmA{*}-SmC{*} phase transitions. These results clearly
   suggest that the achievement of nanosegregation is a powerful tool to
   induce de Vries behavior and to promote first-order SmA{*}-SmC{*} phase
   transitions.}},

Abstract = {{The crystal structure of the membrane-associated {[}NiFe] hydrogenase
   from Allochromatium vinosum has been determined to 2.1 angstrom
   resolution. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy on dissolved crystals showed that it is present in
   the Ni-A state (>90\%). The structure of the A. vinosum {[}NiFe]
   hydrogenase shows significant similarities with {[}NiFe] hydrogenase
   structures derived from Desulfovibrio species. The amino acid sequence
   identity is similar to 50\%. The bimetallic {[}NiFe] active site is
   located in the large subunit of the heterodimer and possesses three
   diatomic non-protein ligands coordinated to the Fe (two CN-, one CO). Ni
   is bound to the protein backbone via four cysteine thiolates; two of
   them also bridge the two metals. One of the bridging cysteines (Cys64)
   exhibits a modified thiolate in part of the sample. A mono-oxo bridging
   ligand was assigned between the metal ions of the catalytic center. This
   is in contrast to a proposal for Desulfovibrio sp. hydrogenases that
   show a di-oxo species in this position for the Ni-A state. The
   additional metal site located in the large subunit appears to be a Mg2+
   ion. Three iron-sulfur clusters were found in the small subunit that
   forms the electron transfer chain connecting the catalytic site with the
   molecular surface. The calculated anomalous Fourier map indicates a
   distorted proximal iron-sulfur cluster in part of the crystals. This
   altered proximal cluster is supposed to be paramagnetic and is exchange
   coupled to the Ni3+ ion and the medial {[}Fe3S4](+) cluster that are
   both EPR active (S=1/2 species). This finding of a modified proximal
   cluster in the {[}NiFe] hydrogenase might explain the observation of
   split EPR signals that are occasionally detected in the oxidized state
   of membrane-bound {[}NiFe] hydrogenases as from A. vinosum. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We present the solution of a linear restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS)

   mapped to a lattice polymer model of Motzkin paths in a slit interacting
   with both walls including an osmotic pressure. This work generalizes the
   previous work on the RSOS model in the half-plane which has a solution
   that was shown recently to exhibit a novel mathematical structure
   involving basic hypergeometric functions (3)phi(2). Because of the
   mathematical relationship between the half-plane and slit this work
   hence effectively explores the underlying q-orthogonal polynomial
   structure to that solution. It also generalizes two other recent works:
   one on Dyck paths weighted with an osmotic pressure in a slit and
   another concerning Motzkin paths without an osmotic pressure term in a

Abstract = {{Full field strain measurements of biological tissue during loading are
   often limited to the quantification of fiduciary marker displacements on
   the tissue surface. These marker measurements can lack the necessary
   spatial resolution to characterize non-uniform deformation and may not
   represent the deformation of the load-bearing collagen microstructure.
   To overcome these potential limitations, a method was developed to track
   the deformation of the collagen fiber microstructure in ligament tissue.
   Using quantitative polarized light imaging, fiber alignment maps
   incorporating both direction and alignment strength at each pixel were
   generated during facet capsular ligament loading. A grid of virtual
   markers was superimposed over the tissue in the alignment maps, and the
   maximization of a vector correlation calculation between fiber alignment
   maps was used to track marker displacement. Tracking error was
   quantified through comparisons to the displacements of excised ligament
   tissue (n=3); separate studies applied uniaxial tension to isolated
   facet capsular ligament tissue (n=4) to evaluate tracking capabilities
   during large tissue deformations. The average difference between virtual
   marker and tissue displacements was 0.07 +/- 0.06 pixels. This error in
   marker location produced principal strain measurements of 1.2 +/- 1.6\%
   when markers were spaced 4 pixels apart. During tensile tissue loading,
   substantial inhomogeneity was detected in the strain field using vector
   correlation tracking, and the location of maximum strain differed from
   that produced by standard tracking techniques using coarser meshes.
   These findings provide a method to directly measure fiber network
   strains using quantitative fiber alignment data, enabling a better
   understanding of structure-function relationships in tissues at
   different length scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In using musculoskeletal models, researchers can calculate muscle
   forces, and subsequently joint contact forces, providing insight into
   joint loading and the progression of such diseases as osteoarthritis
   (OA). The purpose of this study was to estimate the knee contact force
   (KCF) in patients with varying degrees of OA severity using muscle
   forces and joint reaction forces derived from OpenSim. Walking data was
   obtained from healthy individuals (n=14) and those with moderate (n=10)
   and severe knee OA (n=2). For each subject, we generated 3D,
   muscle-actuated, forward dynamic simulations of the walking trials.
   Muscle forces that reproduced each subject's gait were calculated. KCFs
   were then calculated using the vector sum of the muscle forces and joint
   reaction forces along the longitudinal axis of the femur. Moderate OA
   subjects exhibited a similar KCF pattern to healthy subjects, with lower
   second peaks (p=0.021). Although subjects with severe OA had similar
   initial peak KCF to healthy and moderate OA subjects (more than 4 times
   BW), the pattern of the KCF was very different between groups. After an
   initial peak, subjects with severe OA continually unloaded the joint,
   whereas healthy and moderate OA subjects reloaded the knee during late
   stance. In subjects with symmetric OA grades, there appears to be
   differences in loading between OA seventies. Similar initial peaks of
   KCF imply that reduction of peak KCF may not be a compensatory strategy
   for OA patients: however, reducing duration of high magnitude loads may
   be employed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{DNA transactions driven by long-range protein-mediated inter-and

   interactions between pairs of Ter sites located either on the same or on
   different chromosomes. The dimeric Reb1 protein catalyzes termination
   and mediates interaction between Ter sites. The Reb1-dependent
   interactions between two antiparallel Ter sites in cis caused looping
   out of the intervening DNA in vitro and enhancement of fork arrest in
   vivo. A Ter site on chromosome 2 interacted pairwise with two Ter sites
   located on chromosome 1 by chromosome kissing. Mutational inactivation
   of the major interacting Ter site on chromosome 1 significantly reduced
   fork arrest at the Ter site on chromosome 2, thereby revealing a
   cooperative mechanism of control of replication termination.}},

Title = {{In vivo estimation of the short-range stiffness of cross-bridges from

Abstract = {{Short-range stiffness (SRS) is a mechanical property of muscles that is
   characterized by a disproportionally high stiffness within a short
   length range during both lengthening and shortening movements. SRS is
   attributed to the cross-bridges and is beneficial for stabilizing a
   joint during, e.g., postural conditions. Thus far, SRS has been
   estimated mainly on isolated mammalian muscles. In this study we
   presented a method to estimate SRS in vivo in the human wrist joint.
   SRS was estimated at joint level in the angular domain (N m/rad) for
   both flexion and extension rotations of the human wrist in nine healthy
   subjects. Wrist rotations of 0.15 tad at 3 rad/s were imposed at eight
   levels of voluntary contraction ranging from 0 to 2.1 N m by means of a
   single axis manipulator.
   Flexion and extension SRS of the wrist joint was estimated consistently
   and accurately using a dynamic nonlinear model that was fitted onto the
   recorded wrist torque. SRS increased monotonically with torque in a way
   consistent with previous studies on isolated muscles.
   It is concluded that in vivo measurement of joint SRS represents the
   population of coupled cross-bridges in wrist flexor and extensor
   muscles. In its current form, the presented technique can be used for
   clinical applications in many neurological and muscular diseases where
   altered joint torque and (dissociated) joint stiffness are important
   clinical parameters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The effects of nanometric nickel (n-Ni) catalyst on the dehydrogenation
   and rehydrogenation behavior of ball milled lithium alanate (LiAlH4)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study of the effects of nanometric Ni (n-Ni) additive
   having a specific surface area (SSA) of 9.5 and 14.5 m(2)/g on the
   dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation behavior of mechanically (ball)
   milled LiAlH4 has been carried out using Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and volumetric hydrogen
   desorption in a Sieverts-type apparatus under 0.1 MPa H-2 pressure. The
   LiAlH4 + 1, 5 and 10 wt.\% n-Ni mixtures were processed by a simple
   mixing as well as low energy and high energy mechanical (ball) milling
   in a unique magneto-mill. No decomposition during milling up to 1 h has
   been observed for LiAlH4+5 and 10 wt.\% n-Ni. A mixing of LiAlH4 + n-Ni
   still results in the melting of LiAlH4. In contrast, doping with 5 and
   10 wt.\% n-Ni combined with high energy ball milling completely
   eliminates melting of LiAlH4. Volumetric dehydrogenation studies show
   that throughout the entire temperature range from 100 degrees C to 250
   degrees C a LiAlH4+n-Ni nanocomposite system ball milled under high
   energy mode always desorbs hydrogen in a solid state without any melting
   in two stages land II. Stagelis related to the transformation of LiAlH4
   into (Li3AlH6 + Al + H-2) and Stage II is related to the transformation
   of Li3AlH6 into (LiH + Al + H2). The apparent activation energy of Stage
   I and II equals similar to 70 and similar to 100 kJ/mol, respectively.
   This can be compared with the apparent activation energy of ball milled
   undoped LiAlH4 equal to about 90 kJ/mol for both Stage I and II as
   reported in Ref. {[}9]. It is also shown that n-Ni is a very potent
   catalyst destabilizing a ball milled mixture of LiAlH4 + 5 wt.\% to the
   extent that it is capable to desorb slowly quite substantial quantities
   of hydrogen at RT, 40 and 80 degrees C. The rate of H-2 release during
   storage at this temperature range can be easily regulated by increasing
   or decreasing temperature. These virtues make the LiAlH4 + 5 wt.\% n-Ni
   mixture a potential hydrogen storage material for applications where a
   continuous supply of hydrogen is required fora prolonged service time
   as, for example, in some chemical processes where the presence of a
   reducing atmosphere is required. Rehydrogenation attempts of ball milled
   dehydrogenated LiAlH4 + 5 wt.\% n-Ni have been made. The dehydrogenation
   temperatures were selected in such a manner as to rehydrogenate either
   starting from the (Li3AlH3+ Al) (dehydrogenation at 120 degrees C) or
   from the (LiH + Al) (dehydrogenation at 170 and 250 degrees C) phase
   composition. Rehydrogenation temperatures and pressures of H2 were in
   the range of 55-250 degrees C and 0.2-10 MPa, respectively.
   Unfortunately, no successful rehydrogenation has been observed under
   these conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have clinically been
   widely used as antihypertensive agents. In the present study, we
   compared the effects of a centrally active ACE inhibitor, perindopril,
   with those of non-centrally active ACE inhibitors, imidapril and
   enalapril, on cognitive performance in amyloid beta(A beta)
   (25-35)-injected mice, a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease. We also
   determined the brain ACE activity in order to elucidate the relationship
   between the cognitive function and ACE inhibition in the brain. A
   beta(25-35)-injected mice showed a cognitive impairment in spontaneous
   alteration and object recognition tests, the indices of immediate
   working memory and relatively long-term recognition memory,
   respectively. As indicated by these tests, the oral administration of
   perindopril (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg/day) significantly reversed the
   cognitive impairment in these mice, whereas neither imidapril (0.3, 1 or
   3 mg/kg/day) nor enalapril (1, 3 or 10 mg/kg/day) had any effect on
   cognitive performance. Perindopril (1 mg/kg/day), imidapril (3
   mg/kg/day), or enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) all inhibited the plasma ACE
   activities by more than 90\%. Using the same dosing regimen, only
   perindopril inhibited the brain ACE activities by more than 50\%,
   whereas imidapril and enalapril showed much less potent effects. These
   results suggest that perindopril ameliorated the cognitive impairment in
   the Alzheimer's disease model mice through the inhibition of brain ACE
   activity, but not peripheral ACE activity. Based on our observations, we
   concluded that a centrally active ACE inhibitor, perindopril, may
   therefore have a beneficial effect on Alzheimer's disease as well as
   hypertension. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Protein kinases are potential targets for the prevention and control of
   UV-induced skin cancer. T-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is
   highly expressed in skin cancer cells, but its specific function is
   still unknown. We investigated the role of TOPK in UVB-induced apoptosis
   in RPMI7951 human melanoma cells. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry analysis was used to identify proteins that bind with TOPK.
   Immunofluorescence, Western blot, and flow cytometry were used to assess
   the effect of UVB on TOPK, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), and apoptosis in
   RPMI7951 cells. TOPK binds with Prx1 and its phosphorylation of Prx1 at
   Ser-32 is important for regulation of H2O2-mediated signal transduction.
   Analysis of the CD spectra of Prx1 and mutant Prx1 (S32A) proteins
   showed that the secondary structure of Prx1 was significantly altered by
   phosphorylation of Prx1 at Ser-32. UVB irradiation induced
   phosphorylation of TOPK in RPMI7951 human melanoma cells and
   phosphorylated TOPK co-localized with Prx1 in the nucleus. UVB induced
   the peroxidase activity of Prx1 in vitro and ex vivo. Following
   treatment with UVB, H2O2 levels and apoptosis were increased in RPMI7951
   cells stably expressing TOPK siRNA or stably mutant Prx1 (S32A).
   Phosphorylation of Prx1 (Ser-32) by TOPK prevents UVB-induced apoptosis
   in RPMI7951 melanoma cells through regulation of Prx1 peroxidase
   activity and blockade of intracellular H2O2 accumulation.}},

Title = {{Practice effects in healthy adults: A longitudinal study on frequent
   repetitive cognitive testing}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cognitive deterioration is a core symptom of many
   neuropsychiatric disorders and target of increasing significance for
   novel treatment strategies. Hence, its reliable capture in long-term
   follow-up studies is prerequisite for recording the natural course of
   diseases and for estimating potential benefits of therapeutic
   interventions. Since repeated neuropsychological testing is required for
   respective longitudinal study designs, occurrence, time pattern and
   magnitude of practice effects on cognition have to be understood first
   under healthy good-performance conditions to enable design optimization
   and result interpretation in disease trials.
   Methods: Healthy adults (N = 36; 47.3 +/- 12.0 years; mean IQ 127.0 +/-
   14.1; 58\% males) completed 7 testing sessions, distributed
   asymmetrically from high to low frequency, over 1 year (baseline, weeks
   2 3, 6, 9, months 3, 6, 12). The neuropsychological test battery covered
   6 major cognitive domains by several well-established tests each.
   Results: Most tests exhibited a similar pattern upon repetition: (1)
   Clinically relevant practice effects during high-frequency testing until
   month 3 (Cohen's d 0.36-1.19), most pronounced early on, and (2) a
   performance plateau thereafter upon low-frequency testing. Few tests
   were non-susceptible to practice or limited by ceiling effects.
   Influence of confounding variables (age, IQ, personality) was minor.
   Conclusions: Practice effects are prominent particularly in the early
   phase of high-frequency repetitive cognitive testing of healthy
   well-performing subjects. An optimal combination and timing of tests, as
   extractable from this study, will aid in controlling their impact.
   Moreover, normative data for serial testing may now be collected to
   assess normal learning curves as important comparative readout of
   pathological cognitive processes.}},

Title = {{Serum lipoproteins attenuate macrophage activation and Toll-Like
   Receptor stimulation by bacterial lipoproteins}},
Journal = {{BMC IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chlamydia trachomatis was previously shown to express a
   lipoprotein, the macrophage infectivity potentiator (Mip), exposed at
   the bacterial surface, and able to stimulate human primary
   monocytes/macrophages through Toll Like Receptor (TLR)2/TLR1/TLR6, and
   CD14. In PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells the proinflammatory activity of
   Mip was significantly higher in the absence than in the presence of
   serum. The present study aims to investigate the ability of different
   serum factors to attenuate Mip proinflammatory activity in
   PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells and in primary human differentiated
   macrophages. The study was also extend to another lipoprotein, the
   Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein (Osp) A. The proinflammatory
   activity was studied through Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and
   Interleukin (IL)-8 release. Finally, TLR1/2 human embryonic kidney-293
   (HEK-293) transfected cells were used to test the ability of the serum
   factors to inhibit Mip and OspA proinflammatory activity.
   Results: In the absence of any serum and in the presence of 10\%
   delipidated FBS, production of Mip-induced TNF-alpha and IL-8 in
   PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were similar whereas they were
   significantly decreased in the presence of 10\% FBS suggesting an
   inhibiting role of lipids present in FBS. In the presence of 10\% human
   serum, the concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-8 were 2 to 5 times lower
   than in the presence of 10\% FBS suggesting the presence of more potent
   inhibitor(s) in human serum than in FBS. Similar results were obtained
   in primary human differentiated macrophages. Different lipid components
   of human serum were then tested (total lipoproteins, HDL, LDL, VLDL,
   triglyceride emulsion, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, B, E2, and E3). The
   most efficient inhibitors were LDL, VLDL, and apoB that reduced the mean
   concentration of TNF-alpha release in Mip-induced macrophages to 24, 20,
   and 2\%, respectively (p < 0.0001). These lipid components were also
   able to prevent TLR1/2 induced activation by Mip, in HEK-293 transfected
   cells. Similar results were obtained with OspA.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrated the ability of serum lipids to
   attenuate proinflammatory activity of bacterial lipoproteins and
   suggested that serum lipoproteins interact with acyl chains of the lipid
   part of bacterial lipoproteins to render it biologically inactive.}},

Title = {{Assessing changes in vascular permeability in a hamster model of viral
   hemorrhagic fever}},
Journal = {{VIROLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: A number of RNA viruses cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF),
   in which proinflammatory mediators released from infected cells induce
   increased permeability of the endothelial lining of blood vessels,
   leading to loss of plasma volume, hypotension, multi-organ failure,
   shock and death. The optimal treatment of VHF should therefore include
   both the use of antiviral drugs to inhibit viral replication and
   measures to prevent or correct changes in vascular function. Although
   rodent models have been used to evaluate treatments for increased
   vascular permeability (VP) in bacterial sepsis, such studies have not
   been performed for VHF.
   Results: Here, we use an established model of Pichinde virus infection
   of hamsters to demonstrate how changes in VP can be detected by
   intravenous infusion of Evans blue dye (EBD), and compare those
   measurements to changes in hematocrit, serum albumin concentration and
   serum levels of proinflammatory mediators. We show that EBD injected
   into sick animals in the late stage of infection is rapidly sequestered
   in the viscera, while in healthy animals it remains within the plasma,
   causing the skin to turn a marked blue color. This test could be used in
   live animals to detect increased VP and to assess the ability of
   antiviral drugs and vasoactive compounds to prevent its onset. Finally,
   we describe a multiplexed assay to measure levels of serum factors
   during the course of Pichinde arenavirus infection and demonstrate that
   viremia and subsequent increase in white blood cell counts precede the
   elaboration of inflammatory mediators, which is followed by increased VP
   and death.
   Conclusions: This level of model characterization is essential to the
   evaluation of novel interventions designed to control the effects of
   virus-induced hypercytokinemia on host vascular function in VHF, which
   could lead to improved survival.}},

   and thermodynamic constraints on the formation of the Tartarus Colles
   cone groups}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Volcanic rootless constructs (VRCs) are the products of explosive
   lava-water interactions. VRCs are significant because they imply the
   presence of active lava and an underlying aqueous phase (e.g.,
   groundwater or ice) at the time of their formation. Combined mapping of
   VRC locations, age-dating of their host lava surfaces, and thermodynamic
   modeling of lava-substrate interactions can therefore constrain where
   and when water has been present in volcanic regions. This information is
   valuable for identifying fossil hydrothermal systems and determining
   relationships between climate, near-surface water abundance, and the
   potential development of habitable niches on Mars. We examined the
   western Tartarus Colles region (25-27 degrees N, 170-171 degrees E) in
   northeastern Elysium Planitia, Mars, and identified 167 VRC groups with
   a total area of similar to 2000 km(2). These VRCs preferentially occur
   where lava is similar to 60 m thick. Crater size-frequency relationships
   suggest the VRCs formed during the late to middle Amazonian. Modeling
   results suggest that at the time of VRC formation, near-surface
   substrate was partially desiccated, but that the depth to the
   midlatitude ice table was less than or similar to 42 m. This ground ice
   stability zone is consistent with climate models that predict
   intermediate obliquity (similar to 35 degrees) between 75 and 250 Ma,
   with obliquity excursions descending to similar to 25-32 degrees. For
   lava thicknesses ranging from 30 to 60 m and ground ice fractions
   ranging from 0.1 to 0.3, an ice volume of similar to 4-23 km(3) could
   have been melted and/or vaporized by the time the lava solidified, and
   the associated hydrothermal systems could have retained temperatures
   >273 K for up to similar to 1300 years.}},

Abstract = {{Redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) females at different stages of
   vitellogenesis were sampled to investigate variations in soluble
   protein, lipid and water content and in the amino acid and fatty acid
   composition of the hepatopancreas and ovaries. During vitellogenesis,
   the changes in the content of soluble proteins and lipids in the
   hepatopancreas and ovaries were dependent on both diet and the reserves
   from the hepatopancreas. However, in comparison to the ovary, the
   fluctuation of the amino acid composition in the hepatopancreas
   suggested that the protein resources mobilized from this organ was
   compensating for those gained from feeding. Changes in the fatty acid
   composition of the hepatopancreas showed limited compensatory function
   as for the quick accumulation of lipids in the ovaries. The proportional
   amounts of saturated fatty acids/mono-unsaturated fatty
   acids/poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the predominant fatty
   acids in both tissues indicated that the mobilization and utilization of
   fatty acids in freshwater species are different from that in marine
   species. Based on the redclaw's feeding habits, the commercial pellets
   used in this study may not be optimal, and a diet with less PUFA may

Title = {{Impact of supervision of methadone consumption on deaths related to
   methadone overdose (1993-2008): analyses using OD4 index in England and
   Scotland}},
Journal = {{BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},

Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the impact of introduction of supervision of
   methadone dosing on deaths related to overdose of methadone in Scotland
   and England between 1993 and 2008 while controlling for increased
   prescribing of methadone.
   Design Analysis of annual trends in deaths related to overdose of
   methadone in relation to defined daily doses of methadone prescribed.
   Setting Scotland and England.
   Population Deaths in which methadone was coded as the only drug involved
   or as one of the drugs implicated.
   Main outcome measure Annual OD4-methadone index (number of deaths with
   methadone implicated per million defined daily doses of methadone
   prescribed in that year).
   Results OD4-methadone declined substantially over the four epochs of
   four years between 1993 and 2008. It decreased significantly (P<0.05) in
   10 of 12 epoch changes: in Scotland from 19.3 (95\% confidence interval
   15 to 24) to 4.1 (2.8 to 5.4) and finally to 3.0 (2.4 to 3.5) for
   methadone only deaths (and from 58 to 29 to 14 for deaths with any
   mention of methadone); in England from 27.1 (25 to 29) to 24.8 (23 to
   27) and finally to 5.8 (5.3 to 6.3) for methadone only deaths (and from
   46 to 42 to 12 for deaths with any mention of methadone). The decreases
   in OD4-methadone were closely related to the introduction of supervised
   dosing of methadone in both countries, first in Scotland (1995-2000) and
   later in England (1999-2005). These declines occurred over periods of
   substantial increases in prescribing of methadone (18-fold increase in
   defined daily doses per million population annually in Scotland and
   sevenfold increase in England).
   Conclusions Introduction of supervised methadone dosing was followed by
   substantial declines in deaths related to overdose of methadone in both
   Scotland and England. OD4-methadone index analyses, controlled for
   substantial increases in methadone prescribing in both countries,
   identified at least a fourfold reduction in deaths due to methadone
   related overdose per defined daily dose (OD4-methadone) over this
   period.}},

Title = {{DNA barcoding of the Lemnaceae, a family of aquatic monocots}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Members of the aquatic monocot family Lemnaceae (commonly
   called duckweeds) represent the smallest and fastest growing flowering
   plants. Their highly reduced morphology and infrequent flowering result
   in a dearth of characters for distinguishing between the nearly 38
   species that exhibit these tiny, closely-related and often
   morphologically similar features within the same family of plants.
   Results: We developed a simple and rapid DNA-based molecular
   identification system for the Lemnaceae based on sequence polymorphisms.
   We compared the barcoding potential of the seven plastid-markers
   proposed by the CBOL (Consortium for the Barcode of Life) plant-working
   group to discriminate species within the land plants in 97 accessions
   representing 31 species from the family of Lemnaceae. A
   Lemnaceae-specific set of PCR and sequencing primers were designed for
   four plastid coding genes (rpoB, rpoC1, rbcL and matK) and three
   noncoding spacers (atpF-atpH, psbK-psbI and trnH-psbA) based on the
   Lemna minor chloroplast genome sequence. We assessed the ease of
   amplification and sequencing for these markers, examined the extent of
   the barcoding gap between intra- and inter-specific variation by
   pairwise distances, evaluated successful identifications based on direct
   sequence comparison of the ``best close match{''} and the construction
   of a phylogenetic tree.
   Conclusions: Based on its reliable amplification, straightforward
   sequence alignment, and rates of DNA variation between species and
   within species, we propose that the atpF-atpH noncoding spacer could
   serve as a universal DNA barcoding marker for species-level
   identification of duckweeds.}},

Abstract = {{Domains rich in cationic amino acids are ubiquitous in peptides with the
   ability to cross cell membranes, which is likely related to the binding
   of such polypeptides to anionic groups on the membrane surface. To shed
   more light on these interactions, we investigated specific interactions
   between basic amino acids and oligopeptides thereof and anions by means
   of electrophoretic experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. To
   this end, we measured the electrophoretic mobilities of arginine,
   lysine, tetraarginine, and tetralysine in sodium chloride and sodium
   sulfate electrolytes as a function of ionic strength. The mobility was
   found to be consistently lower in sodium sulfate than in sodium chloride
   at the same ionic strength. The decrease in mobility in sodium sulfate
   was greater for tetraarginine than for tetralysine and was larger for
   tetrapeptides compared to the corresponding free amino acids. On the
   basis of molecular dynamics simulations and Bjerrum theory, we
   rationalize these results in terms of enhanced association between the
   amino acid side chains and sulfate. Simulations also predict a greater
   affinity of sulfate to the guanidinium side chain groups of arginine
   than to the ammonium groups of lysine, as the planar guanidinium
   geometry allows simultaneous strong hydrogen bonding to two sulfate
   oxygens. We show that the sulfate binding to arginine, but not to
   lysine, is cooperative. These results are consistent with the greater
   decrease in the mobility of arginine compared to that of lysine upon
   addition of sulfate salt. The nonspecific mobility retardation by
   sulfate is ascribed to its electrostatic interaction with the cationic
   amino acid side chain groups.}},

Abstract = {{Tire-wear is an important source of PAHs, elemental carbon (EC) and
   organic carbon (OC). The emissions of these pollutants have been studied
   in an experimental set-up, simulating a realistic road-tire interaction
   (summer tire-concrete road). The large particle non-exhaust emissions
   (LPNE; diameter greater than 10 mu m) have been evaluated over 14,500 km
   run of the tire. An increasing linear trend with cumulative km run was
   observed for emissions of PAHs and carbon. Amongst PAHs in LPNE, pyrene
   has been observed to be the highest (30 +/- 4 mg kg(-1)) followed by
   benzolghijperylene (17 +/- 2 mg kg(-1)), Different fractions of EC-OC
   for tire-wear have been analyzed, and unlike exhaust emissions, EC1 was
   observed to be 99\% of EC whereas more than 70\% of the OC was the high

Abstract = {{Amorphous microporous silica (AMS) xerogel materials were synthesized in
   an acid-catalyzed sol-gel process. The porosity of AMS was adapted by
   varying sol-gel synthesis parameters including the molar hydrolysis
   ratio (r-value), HCl:Si molar ratio, the type of silicon alkoxide source
   and the solvent. AMS particles of millimeter size were loaded with
   ibuprofen, by heat treatment and melt impregnation. In vitro release
   experiments were performed in simulated gastric and intestinal fluid.
   The release kinetics were critically depending on the AMS particle size
   distribution and the micropore diameter. The release was interpreted as
   configurational diffusion in the AMS micropores. The stability of
   unloaded and ibuprofen loaded AMS material upon storage was investigated
   using nitrogen physisorption, DSC analysis and in vitro release
   experiments. Ibuprofen loaded AMS formulations show remarkable
   stability, which can be attributed to the presence of ibuprofen
   molecules in the channels, functioning as scaffolds to support the pore
   structure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition of polyelectrolytes (PEs) on porous
   substrates has emerged as a versatile and inexpensive method to form
   high flux nanofiltration (NF) membranes. PE complexes (PECs) were
   prepared by alternative deposition of poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
   chloride (PDDA) and sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) on
   hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (PAN-H) supports. PDDA/SPEEK multilayers
   consisting of 5, 10, 15 and 20 bilayers were deposited from solutions
   with different NaCl concentrations. Film thickness was studied by AFM.
   Thicker films were formed with increasing the bilayer number and the
   salt concentration. For the first time, multilayered PDDA/SPEEK PEC
   membranes were applied as NF membrane in an anion separation
   application. The NF performance of PDDA/SPEEK membranes was studied for
   single salt solutions (chloride, sulfate and phosphate) as well as
   mixed-salt (binary and ternary). Membranes showed different retentions
   and fluxes for anions in single and mixed-salt solutions. When using
   mixed-salt solutions, the retentions were found to be higher compared to
   the single salt NF experiment results. HPO42- ions showed a remarkable
   influence on the performance of the PEC membranes via formation of
   intermolecular bonds within the polymer chains. In the best case,
   membranes showed Cl-/SO42- and Cl-/HPO42- selectivities of 20 in the
   separation of mixed-salt solutions. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{70-76}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{We observed that the concept of critical flux, although established on
   physical bases, does not describe all typical fouling situations found
   in membrane filtration. We especially focus on the slow flux decline
   that is observed in many industrial membrane applications, and that has
   found several types of explanations that we briefly discuss. In order to
   get a better understanding of this situation, we have considered the
   orders of magnitude of the slow aggregation kinetics that are expected
   to happen within a boundary layer, on an ultrafiltration or
   microfiltration membrane in operation. The results help to understand
   that whereas the critical flux is limiting cross-flow filtration of
   stable colloids, it should be combined to kinetics aspects of slow
   aggregation in cases of colloids of intermediate stability (metastable).
   We discuss some consequences on the design and operation of processes
   using membrane filtration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Improved eradication of Clostridium difficile spores from toilets of
   hospitalized patients using an accelerated hydrogen peroxide as the
   cleaning agent}},
Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: C. difficle spores in the environment of patients with C.
   difficile associated disease (CDAD) are difficult to eliminate. Bleach
   (5000 ppm) has been advocated as an effective disinfectant for the
   environmental surfaces of patients with CDAD. Few alternatives to bleach
   for non-outbreak conditions have been evaluated in controlled healthcare
   studies.
   Methods: This study was a prospective clinical comparison during
   non-outbreak conditions of the efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen
   peroxide cleaner (0.5\% AHP) to the currently used stabilized hydrogen
   peroxide cleaner (0.05\% SHP at manufacturer recommended use-dilution)
   with respect to spore removal from toilets in a tertiary care facility.
   The toilets used by patients who had diarrhea with and without C.
   difficile associated disease (CDAD) were cultured for C. difficile and
   were monitored using an ultraviolet mark (UVM) to assess cleaning
   compliance on a daily basis 5 days per week. A total of 243 patients and
   714 samples were analysed. The culture results were included in the
   analysis only if the UVM audit from the same day confirmed that the
   toilet had been cleaned.
   Results: Our data demonstrated that the efficacy of spore killing is
   formulation specific and cannot be generalized. The Oxivir(TB)(R) AHP
   formulation resulted in statistically significantly (p = 0.0023) lower
   levels of toxigenic C. difficile spores in toilets of patients with CDAD
   compared to the SHP formulation that was routinely being used (28\% vs
   45\% culture positive). The background level of toxigenic C. difficile
   spores was 10\% in toilets of patients with diarrhea not due to CDAD.
   The UVM audit indicated that despite the enhanced twice-daily cleaning
   protocol for CDAD patients cleaning was not achieved on approximately 30
   - 40\% of the days tested.
   Conclusion: Our data indicate that the AHP formulation evaluated that
   has some sporicidal activity was significantly better than the currently
   used SHP formulation. This AHP formulation provides a one-step process
   that significantly lowers the C. difficile spore level in toilets during
   non-outbreak conditions without the workplace safety concerns associated
   with 5000 ppm bleach.}},
