Abstract = {{Entarnoeba histolytica is the causative agent of annoebiasis, a
   poverty-related disease that kills an estimated 100000 people each year.
   E histolytica does not contain `standard mitochondria', but harbours
   mitochondrial remnant organelles called mitosomes. These organelles are
   characterized by the presence of mitochondrial chaperonin Cpn60, but
   little else is known about the functions and molecular composition of
   mitosomes. In this study, a gene encoding molecular chaperonin Cpn10 -
   the functional partner of Cpn60 - was cloned, and its structure and
   expression were characterized, as well as the cellular localization of
   its encoded protein. The 5' untranslated region of the gene contains all
   of the structural promoter elements required for transcription in this
   organism. The amoebic Cpn10, like Cpn60, is not significantly
   upregulated upon heat-shock treatment. Computer-assisted protein
   modelling, and specific antibodies against Cpn10 and Cpn60, suggest that
   both proteins interact with each other, and that they function in the
   same intracellular compartment. Thus, E histolytica appears to have
   retained at least two of the key molecular components required for the
   refolding of imported mitosomal proteins.}},

Abstract = {{To quantify variation in clinical phenotype of severe haemophilia we
   performed a single centre cohort study among 171 severe haemophilia
   patients. Age at first joint bleed, treatment requirement (i.e. annual
   clotting factor use), annual bleeding frequency and arthropathy were
   documented. Because treatment strategies intensified during follow-up,
   patients were stratified in two age groups: patients born 1968-1985 (n =
   91), or 1985-2002 (n = 80). A total of 2166 patient-years of follow-up
   were available (median 12.0 years per patient). Age at first joint bleed
   ranged from 0.2 to 5.8 years. Patients who had their first joint bleed
   later needed less treatment and developed less arthropathy. In patients
   born 1968-1985 during both on-demand and prophylactic treatment, the
   75th percentile of annual joint bleed frequency was consistently four
   times as high as the 25th percentile. In both age groups variation in
   annual clotting factor use between 25th and 75th percentiles was 1.4-1.5
   times for prophylaxis and 3.8 times for on-demand treatment. To
   conclude, the onset of joint bleeding is inversely related with
   treatment requirement and arthropathy and may serve as an indicator of
   clinical phenotype. Thus, providing a starting point for aetiological
   research and individualization of treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Background To date, it remains unclear to what extent cognitive
   competence is related to a change in general functional status in older
   adults.
   Objectives To evaluate both the cross-sectional and the longitudinal
   relation between cognitive functioning and functional status.
   Methods Sensorimotor speed, memory, and executive functioning were
   assessed in a large population of healthy adults aged 60 years and older
   (n = 485) who participated in the Maastricht Aging Study. Data from the
   baseline (1993-1995), three-year follow-up, and six-year follow-up were
   used. Functional status was measured using the SF-36, which was coded
   into a physical and a mental component summary measure.
   Results After adjustment for age, sex, and educational level, a high
   level of cognitive functioning appeared to be associated with better
   functional status in the cross-sectional analysis. Longitudinal analyses
   demonstrated, that cognitive functioning was not a predictor of
   functional status three or six years later.
   Conclusions Thus while cognitive functioning is useful clinically for
   predicting the short-term functional status of an older person, it is
   not useful for predicting that person's long-term (> 3 years) functional
   status and thus the period of validity of the results of these tests in
   answering such questions is limited. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \&

Title = {{Square lattice directed paths adsorbing on the line Y = qX}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT}},
Year = {{2005}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Consider fully directed paths from the origin in the square lattice and
   confined to the q/p-wedge formed by the Y-axis and the line Y = (q/p)X,
   where (p, q) is a pair of positive integers. If such a path is
   constrained to end in a vertex in the line Y = (q/p)X, then we call it a
   q/p-Dyck path. Suppose that g(q/p)(t, z) is the generating function of
   q/p-Dyck paths, and suppose that the generating variable for edges (or
   steps) is t, and that z is the generating variable of vertices in the
   line Y = (q/p)X ( these are visits to the adsorbing line Y = (q/p)X). In
   this paper it is shown that q/1-Dyck or 1/q-Dyck paths adsorb at the
   critical value of z given by z(q/1) = z(1/q) = q + 1. Evidence that
   z(q/p) >= p + q is presented and the results are extended to models of
   directed paths from the origin in the r-wedge formed by the Y-axis and
   the line Y = rX, where r >= 0 is a real number. If g(r)(t) is the
   generating function of such paths, then let the radius of convergence of
   g(r)(t) be t(r). I find a general expression for t(r), and prove that if
   r = pi, then t(pi) = pi(pi/(1+pi))/(1 + pi). This result estimates the
   exponential rate of growth of the number of directed paths in a
   pi-wedge. Models of q/p-Dyck paths with an area generating variable are
   also considered, and the generating function of this model is determined
   in the case where p = 1.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: An effective pretargeting strategy was developed for renal cell
   carcinoma (RCC) based on a biologically produced bispecific monoclonal
   antibody: anti-RCC x anti-DTPA(In) (bsMAb: G250 x DTIn-1). Tumour uptake
   of a In-111-labelled bivalent peptide after pretargeting with bsMAb G250
   x DTIn-1 was relatively high compared with that in other pretargeting
   systems using chemically coupled F(ab')(2) fragments. Here, we
   investigated the effect of the bsMAb form in the pretargeting strategy.
   Methods: To determine the optimal interval between the administration of
   each of the bsMAb forms and the In-111-labelled bivalent peptide, the
   biodistribution of the radioiodinated bsMAb forms was studied in athymic
   mice with subcutaneous SK-RC-1 RCC tumours. Since tumour targeting of
   the radiolabelled peptide depends on the bsMAb form and dose, a bsMAb
   dose escalation study was carried out for both bsMAb forms. Under
   optimised conditions, the biodistribution of the In-111 label in mice
   with pretargeted RCC was determined from 4 h up to 7 days p.i.
   Results: The optimal interval between the two administrations was 72 h
   for the bsMAb IgG and 4 h for the bsMAb F (ab')(2). The optimal bsMAb
   dose for intact IgG was 67 pmol and the optimal bsMAb F(ab')(2) dose was
   200 pmol. Targeting of the pretargeted RCC with 4 pmol In-111-labelled
   bivalent peptide revealed high tumour uptake with both bsMAb forms.
   Conclusion: With the pretargeting strategy, using either bsMAb IgG or
   bsMAb F(ab')(2), very efficient peptide targeting of the tumour was
   obtained. Uptake and retention of the radiolabel in the tumour with the
   pretargeting approach are not affected by the bsMAb form used.}},

   aspects that need to be considered when calculating SAR in a human body
   close to a mobile phone base station antenna. A hybrid FEM/MoM technique
   is proposed as a suitable numerical method to obtain accurate results.
   The verification of the FEM/MoM implementation has been presented in a
   previous publication; the focus of this study is an investigation into
   the detail that must be included in a numerical model of the antenna, to
   accurately represent the real-world scenario. This is accomplished by
   comparing numerical results to measurements for a generic GSM base
   station antenna and appropriate, representative canonical and human
   phantoms. The results show that it is critical to take the disturbance
   effect of the human phantom (a large conductive body) on the base
   station antenna into account when the antenna-phantom spacing is less
   than 300 mm. For these small spacings, the antenna structure must be
   modeled in detail. The conclusion is that it is feasible to calculate,
   using the proposed techniques and methodology, accurate occupational
   compliance zones around base station antennas based on a SAR profile and
   basic restriction guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the effects of acute stress on inflammatory,
   haemostatic, rheological, and haemodynamic activity in patients with
   rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) in comparison with patients with
   osteoarthritis (OA).
   Methods: 21 patients with RA and 10 with OA underwent a brief mental
   stress task while standing. Inflammatory, haemostatic, rheological, and
   haemodynamic variables were measured at baseline, during the task, and
   at recovery.
   Results: At baseline, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen were
   higher in RA than OA. White blood cell count, fibrinogen, blood
   pressure, and pulse rate increased, whereas prothrombin time and plasma
   volume decreased during the task in both patient groups. The stress task
   increased C reactive protein (CRP) only in patients with RA, and more
   specifically in those patients with RA with high disease activity.
   Conclusions: The increase in the inflammatory marker CRP, which was
   specific to patients with RA, combined with the haemostatic,
   rheological, and haemodynamic reactions to the stress task, over and
   above the already high baseline levels, could underlie the increased
   risk for myocardial infarction in this vulnerable patient group.}},

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},

Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{282-287}},

Abstract = {{Frugivorous birds disperse the seeds of many fruit-bearing plants, but
   the fate of seeds after defecation or regurgitation is often unknown.
   Some rodents gather and scatter hoard seeds, and some of these may be
   overlooked, germinate, and establish plants. We show that these two
   disparate modes of seed dispersal are linked in some plants. Rodents
   removed large (> 25 mg) seeds from simulated bird feces (pseudofeces) at
   rates of 8-50\%/day and scatter hoarded them in soil. Ants (Formica
   sibylla) also harvested some seeds and carried them to their nests.
   Rodents carried seeds 2.5 +/- 3.2 m to cache sites (maximum 12 in) and
   buried seeds at 8 +/- 7 min depth. Enclosure studies suggest that yellow
   pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus) and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus)
   made the caches. In spring, some seeds germinated from rodent caches and
   established seedlings, but no seedlings established directly from
   pseudofeces. This form of two-phase seed dispersal is important because
   each phase offers different benefits to plants. Frugivory by birds
   permits relatively long-range dispersal and potential colonization of
   new sites, whereas rodent caching moves seeds from exposed, low-quality
   sites (bird feces on the ground surface) to a soil environment that may
   help maintain seed viability and promote successful seedling
   establishment.}},

Abstract = {{The volumetric mass transfer coefficient k(L)a in a 0.1 m-diameter
   bubble column was studied for an air-slurry system. A C-9-C-11
   n-paraffin oil was employed as the liquid phase with fine alumina
   catalyst carrier particles used as the solid phase. The n-paraffin oil
   had properties similar to those of the liquid phase in a commercial
   Fischer-Tropsch reactor under reaction conditions. The superficial gas
   velocity U-G was varied in the range of 0.01 to 0.8 m/s, spanning both
   the homogeneous and heterogeneous flow regimes. The slurry concentration
   epsilon(s) ranged from 0 to 0.5. The experimental results obtained show
   that the gas hold-up epsilon(G) decreases with an increase in slurry
   concentration, with this decrease being most significant when epsilon(s)
   < 0.2. k(L)a/epsilon(G) was found to be practically independent of the
   superficial gas velocity when U-G > 0.1 m/s is taking on values
   predominantly between 0.4 and 0.6 s(-1) when epsilon(s) = 0.1 to 0.4,

Abstract = {{Purpose: In our Phase II prostate cancer Adaptive Radiation Therapy
   (ART) study, the highest possible dose was selected on the basis of
   normal tissue tolerance constraints. We analyzed rectal toxicity rates
   in different dose levels and treatment groups to determine whether
   equivalent toxicity rates were achieved as hypothesized when the
   protocol was started.
   Methods and Materials: From 1999 to 2002, 331 patients with clinical
   stage T1 to T3, node-negative prostate cancer were prospectively treated
   with three-dimensional conformal adaptive RT. A patient-specific
   confidence-limited planning target volume was constructed on the basis
   of 5 CT scans and 4 sets of electronic portal images after the first 4
   days of treatment. For each case, the rectum (rectal solid) was
   contoured in its entirety. The rectal wall was defined by use of a 3-mm
   wall thickness (median volume: 29.8 cc). The prescribed dose level was
   chosen using the following rectal wall dose constraints: (1) Less than
   30\% of the rectal wall volume can receive more than 75.6 Gy. (2) Less
   than 5\% of the rectal wall can receive more than 82 Gy. Low-risk
   patients (PSA < 10, Stage <= T2a, Gleason score < 7) were treated to the
   prostate alone (Group 1). All other patients, intermediate and high
   risk, where treated to the prostate and seminal vesicles (Group 2). The
   risk of chronic toxicity (NCI Common Toxicity Criteria 2.0) was assessed
   for the different dose levels prescribed. HIC approval was acquired for
   all patients. Median follow-up was 1.6 years.
   Results: Grade 2 chronic rectal toxicity was experienced by 34 patients
   (10\%) (9\% experienced rectal bleeding, 6\% experienced proctitis, 3\%
   experienced diarrhea, and 1\% experienced rectal pain) at a median
   interval of 1.1 year. Nine patients (3\%) experienced grade 3 or higher
   chronic rectal toxicity (1 Grade 4) at a median interval of 1.2 years.
   The 2-year rates of Grade 2 or higher and Grade 3 or higher chronic
   rectal toxicity were 17\% and 3\%, respectively. No significant
   difference by dose level was seen in the 2-year rate of Grade 2 or
   higher chronic rectal toxicity. These rates were 27\%, 15\%, 14\%, 17\%,
   and 24\% for dose levels equal to or less than 72, 73.8, 75.6, 77.4, and
   79.2 Gy, respectively (p = 0.3). Grade 2 or higher chronic rectal
   bleeding was significantly grreater for Group 2 than for Group 1, 17\%
   vs. 8\% (p = 0.035).
   Conclusions: High doses (79.2 Gy) were safely delivered in selected
   patients by our adaptive radiotherapy process. Under the rectal
   dose-volume histogram constraints for the dose level selection, the risk
   of chronic rectal toxicity is similar among patients treated to
   different dose levels. Therefore, rectal chronic toxicity rates reflect
   the dose-volume cutoff used and are independent of the actual dose
   levels. On the other hand, a larger PTV will increase the rectal wall
   dose and chronic rectal toxicity rates. PTV volume and dose constraints
   should be defined, considering their potential benefit. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Purpose: Prostate brachytherapy is an established treatment modality in
   early stage prostate cancer. We retrospectively reviewed our experience
   with low dose rate (LDR) and high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy as a
   single treatment modality for early prostate cancer with emphasis on
   chronic toxicity.
   Materials and Methods: From June 1996 to August 2003, 253 patients with
   stage II prostate cancer, prostate specific antigen less than 12 and
   Gleason score less than 7 were treated with brachlytherapy alone at our
   institution. A total of 92 patients underwent HDR brachytherapy with
   Ir-192, while 161 underwent LDR brachytherapy with Pd-103. HDR minimum
   prostate dose was 38 Gy, delivered in 4 fractions with a single implant
   during 36 hours. For HDR we used real-time dynamic 3-dimensional
   ultrasound base dosimetry. For Pd-103 seed implants the dose was 120 Gy
   using selective peripheral weighted dose distribution. Treatment was
   given based on patient preference after pretreatment transrectal
   ultrasound. Toxicity was scored using the National Cancer Institute
   Common Toxicity Criteria 2.0. Median followup in all 253 cases was 2.9
   years.
   Results: In all patients the rate of 3-year urinary toxicity grade 2 or
   greater and grade 3 or greater was 26\% and 6.9\%, which was not
   significantly different between HDR and LDR (p = 0.3 and 0.4,
   respectively). However, grade 1 urogenital toxicity was lower for HDR (p
   = 0.002). The 3-year grade 2 rectal toxicity rate was 0.8\% with no
   grade 3 or greater events, which was and similar in the HDR and LDR
   groups (1\% and 0.6\%, respectively). No cancer related deaths occurred
   and 4-year overall survival was 99\% for HDR and 96.4\% for LDR (p =
   0.4). The 3-year American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
   biochemical control rate was 90\% for LDR and 93\% for HDR. Cox
   multivariate analysis for grade 2 or greater urinary toxicity was
   significant for the use of 14 or greater needles (HR 6.1, p = 0.02) and
   hormonal therapy (HR 2.2, p = 0.02). In the absence of risk factors the
   4-year grade 2 or greater urinary toxicity rate was 7\% vs 65\% if the 2
   risk factors were present (p <0.001). Impotence crude rates were 18.3\%
   for HDR and 41.3\% for LDR (p = 0.002).
   Conclusions: HDR and LDR chronic urinary toxicity grade 2 or greater
   rates were equivalent. However, grade 1 was lower for HDR. The impotence
   rate was decrease by half with HDR. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and 14
   or greater needles were significantly associated with increased chronic
   urinary toxicity on multivariate analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Results of the combined investigation of atomic and electronic structure
   of the W(110)/C-R(15x3) surface carbide are reported. A variety of
   experimental techniques has been involved such as scanning tunneling
   microscopy (STM), low-energy electron diffraction, x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, and angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES).
   Distance-dependent STM measurements show a nontrivial geometrical
   behavior in the topography data, demonstrating five different patterns
   representing the superstructure at different values of the tip-surface
   separation. Atomic resolution was achieved at lower tunneling gap
   resistance. An unexpected spatial asymmetry in the distribution of the
   local density of states across the surface unit cell has been observed
   as well. Photoelectron spectroscopy of C1s and W4f core levels clarifies
   the nature of the chemical bonding in the system. The band mapping with
   ARPES provides information on the wave-vector dependence of the
   electronic states. Notable quantum size and superlattice effects were
   discovered in the dispersion of the valence-band states. The
   experimental data suggests an apparent one-dimensional character of the
   electronic structure. Lateral quantization and umklapp scattering are
   proposed as explanation. Finally, based on photoemission and STM
   measurements, an improved crystallographic model of the tungsten surface
   carbide is introduced.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial wastewater is often polluted by Cr(VI) compounds, presenting
   a serious environmental problem. This study addresses the removal of
   toxic, mutagenic Cr(VI) by means of microbial reduction to Cr(III),
   which can then be precipitated as oxides or hydroxides and extracted
   from the aquatic system. A strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis L-02 was
   isolated from a bacterial consortium used for the remediation of a
   chromate-contaminated constructed wetland system. This strain reduced
   Cr(VI) by using pyruvate as an electron donor under anaerobic
   conditions. The aims of the present study were to investigate the
   specific rate of Cr(VI) reduction by the strain L-02, the effects of
   chromate and nitrate (available as electron acceptors) on the strain,
   and the interference of chromate and nitrate reduction processes. The
   presence of Cr(VI) decreased the growth rate of the bacterium. Chromate
   and nitrate reduction did not occur under sterile conditions but was
   observed during tests with the strain L-02. The presence of nitrate
   increased both the specific Cr(VI) reduction rate and the cell number.
   Under denitrifying conditions, Cr(VI) reduction was not inhibited by
   nitrite, which was produced during nitrate reduction. The average
   specific rate of chromate reduction reached 4.4 mu mol Cr 10(10)
   cells(-1) h(-1), but was only 2.0 mu mol Cr 10(10) cells(-1) h(-1) at 20
   degrees C. The maximum specific rate was as high as 8.8-9.8 mu mol Cr
   10(10) cells(-1) h(-1). The role of nitrate in chromate reduction is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Compact models for micromechanical squeezed-film dampers with gap sizes
   comparable to the surface dimensions are presented. Two different models
   considering both the border flow and non-uniform pressure distribution
   effects are first derived for small squeeze numbers. In the first
   `surface extension' model the border effects are considered simply by
   calculating the damping with extended surface dimensions, and in the
   second `border flow channel' model an additional short fictitious flow
   channel is placed at the damper borders. Utilizing a large amount of
   two-dimensional (2D) FEM simulation results by varying the damper
   dimensions, mainly the ratio a/h between the surface length and the air
   gap height, surface elongations are extracted using both elongation
   models. Both linear and torsional modes of motion are considered at the
   continuum flow regime. These results show that the `surface extension'
   model is superior, since the extracted elongation Delta a is almost
   constant (Delta a = 1.3h), leading to a very simple model. Next, the
   rare gas effects are included in the `surface extension' model in the
   slip flow regime (Knudsen number 0 < Kn < 0.13). Considering slip
   boundary conditions, 2D FEM simulations are repeated and the
   elongations, now functions of the Knudsen number, are extracted from the
   results. A simple fitted equation for calculating the surface extension
   Delta a finally results. The maximum relative errors of the models are
   smaller than 10\% for a/h > 4 in the linear motion and for a/h > 10 in
   the torsional motion. The model assumes incompressible flow and thus the
   maximum frequency where the models are valid is limited. In typical MEMS
   topologies where the elongations must be considered, this means that the
   models are valid below frequencies of 500 kHz. To also model rectangular
   2D squeezed-film dampers, these elongations are applied directly in the
   surface length. and width used in the compact models. Comparison with
   three-dimensional (3D) FEM simulations shows that the new model gives
   excellent results, and it extends the validity range of existing compact
   models. The maximum relative error of the models is smaller than 10\%
   for a/h > 16 in the linear motion and for a/h > 16 in the torsional
   motion. The new surface extension model is useful in simulating both the
   circuit level and the system level behavior of gas-damped
   microelectromechanical devices with aspect ratios greater than 2 in the
   time and frequency domains.}},

Abstract = {{Tandemly repeated DNA sequences are highly dynamic components of
   genomes(1). Most repeats are in intergenic regions, but some are in
   coding sequences or pseudogenes(2). In humans, expansion of intragenic
   triplet repeats is associated with various diseases, including
   Huntington chorea and fragile X syndrome(3,4). The persistence of
   intragenic repeats in genomes suggests that there is a compensating
   benefit. Here we show that in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
   most genes containing intragenic repeats encode cell- wall proteins. The
   repeats trigger frequent recombination events in the gene or between the
   gene and a pseudogene, causing expansion and contraction in the gene
   size. This size variation creates quantitative alterations in phenotypes
   ( e. g., adhesion, flocculation or biofilm formation). We propose that
   variation in intragenic repeat number provides the functional diversity
   of cell surface antigens that, in fungi and other pathogens, allows
   rapid adaptation to the environment and elusion of the host immune
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: patients treated by I-131 may require blood sampling in the
   days following its administration. We investigated the safety of such
   samples in terms of radioactivity and the possible disturbance of the
   analyses by these ``131I-spiked{''} samples. Method: 1) the
   radioactivity of blood samples from 131I-treated patients was measured
   (dose rate, surface activity, total activity); 2) the risk for the
   personnel was subsequently evaluated and; 3) the interference of this
   131I-generated radioactivity on the results of routine automated and
   IRMA assays was investigated. Results: 1) all RA measures but two were
   found below the European limits; 2) irradiation of personnel was
   negligible; 3) the faint radioactivity did not disturb any analyses.
   Conclusion: these data demonstrate the safety that results from the
   negligible radioactivity in these blood samples.}},

Abstract = {{Summer atmospheric coastal dynamics exert a significant influence on the
   levels and composition of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) in the
   North-Eastern Iberian Peninsula. Summer atmospheric scenarios in this
   region present a high degree of complexity as they are characterised by
   the absence of synoptic-scale air mass advections, the development of
   breeze circulations, enhanced photochemistry, local mineral dust
   re-suspension and the occurrence of African dust outbreaks. Three
   sampling sites were selected in Barcelona (NE Spain), an urban coastal
   site surrounded by complex topography. Regional dust modelling (DREAM)
   and high resolution meteorological modelling (MM5) were used to
   interpret PM levels and composition at the three sites. The results
   outline the effect of breeze dynamics and thermal internal boundary
   layer formation as the main meteorological drivers of the hourly
   evolution of PM levels. Levels of crustal components, secondary
   inorganic and carbon species are higher during the night, and only the
   marine aerosol content is higher during the day. Nitrate levels are
   higher during the night due to the thermal stability on NH4NO3. Sulphate
   levels are higher during the night as a consequence of the drainage
   flows. Lidar measurements and model results signalled the occurrence of
   two African dust episodes during the study period which mainly affected
   the free troposphere over Barcelona. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to identify the support caregivers provide by
   their own initiative when performing an everyday occupation together
   with their partner who has dementia. This is to identify what type of
   self-initiated caregiver support enhances or limits the performance of
   the person with dementia.. Thirty cohabitating couples participated. One
   of the spouses in each couple was the primary caregiver for a partner
   with mild to moderate dementia. Observational data were collected in the
   participants' homes, where each couple was asked to prepare afternoon
   tea together. The performances were documented by video and
   supplementary field notes. Data were analyzed using a qualitative
   comparative approach. The results of the analyses identified two major
   themes related to support the caregivers provided: provision of a
   supportive working climate and provision of practical support. A third
   theme was related to negative aspects of caregiver support. The results
   of this study have implications for how occupational therapists and
   caregivers in dementia care can support and guide primary caregivers in

Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{18}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{During development, the imaginal wing disc of Drosophila is subdivided
   into territories separated by developmental boundaries. The best
   characterized boundaries delimit compartments defined by cell-lineage
   restrictions. Here, we analyze the formation of a boundary that does not
   rely on such restrictions, namely, that which separates the notum (body
   wall) and the wing hinge (appendage). It is known that the homeobox
   genes of the Iroquois complex (Iro-C) define the notum territory and
   that the distal limit of the Iro-C expression domain demarks the
   boundary between the notum and the wing hinge. However, it is unclear
   how this boundary is established and maintained. We now find that msh, a
   homeobox gene of the Msx family, is strongly expressed in the territory
   of the hinge contiguous to the Iro-C domain. Loss- and gain-of-function
   analyses show that msh maintains Iro-C repressed in the hinge, while
   Iro-C prevents high level expression of msh in the notum. Thus, a mutual
   repression between msh and Iro-C is essential to set the limit between
   the contiguous domains of expression of these genes and therefore to
   establish and/or maintain the boundary between body wall and wing. In
   addition, we find that msh is necessary for proper growth of the hinge
   territory and the differentiation of hinge structures. msh also
   participates in the patterning of the notum, where it is expressed at
   low levels.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1120-1126}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In spite of a growing understanding of the actions of
   5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the prefrontal cortex, the specific
   cellular mechanism used by 5-HT in this region remains poorly
   understood. Previous studies have shown that 5-HT inhibits the
   afterhyperpolarization that follows a burst of spikes in pyramidal
   neurons. In the present study, we have used whole cell recordings in rat
   and mouse brain slices to re-examine this phenomenon with special
   emphasis on identifying the 5-HT receptor subtypes mediating this
   effect. Layer V pyramidal neurons display complex
   afterhyperpolarizations that are mediated predominantly by
   calcium-activated potassium channels and involve two distinct currents
   known as medium afterhyperpolarizating current and slow
   afterhyperpolarizating current (I-sAHP). Administration of 5-HT reduced
   the current underlying these afterhyperpolarizations by selectively
   inhibiting I-sAHP. Pharmacological analysis of this response indicates
   that the main receptor responsible for this inhibition belongs to the
   5-HT2A subtype. Thus, alpha-methyl-5-HT and
   2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine (DOB) mimic the effect of 5-HT and the
   effect of these agonists is blocked by MDL 100 907. Similarly,
   administration of alpha-methyl-5-HT is without effect in slices derived
   from 5-HT2A receptor knockout mice. However, 5-HT2A receptor blockade
   only partially suppressed the ability of 5-HT to inhibit I-sAHP. This
   suggests the involvement of at least one more receptor subtype in this
   response. Consistent with this idea, administration of
   5-carboxyamido-tryptamine, an agonist exhibiting no detectable affinity
   for 5-HT2A receptors, was also capable of suppressing I-sAHP. These
   results identify 5-HT2A receptors as being primarily involved in
   mediating the 5-HT-induced inhibition of I-sAHP in prefrontal cortex,
   while also recognizing a contribution by an additional 5-HT receptor
   subtype.}},

Abstract = {{Reports of a possible correlation between anti-Scl-70 antibody
   concentration and clinical manifestations in systemic sclerosis patients
   have recently appeared in the scientific literature. The goal of our
   study was to evaluate, by means of a multicenter study, the analytical
   reliability of immunoassay systems in the quantitative measurement of
   Scl-70 antibodies. Three blind samples (H, M, L) at different
   anti-Scl-70 antibody concentrations, and a low concentration antibody
   serum (LPC) used as a common calibrator, were sent three times in a
   6-month time span to 39 Italian clinical laboratories. Each laboratory
   was asked to calculate dosages following the enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA) method they used and report the optical density values of
   each sample (ODs), of the cutoff serum provided by the manufacturer of
   the kit used (ODco) and of LPC (ODLPC). The overall analytical
   imprecision (between methods and between laboratories) of the three
   different determinations of the values respectively expressed in ODs,
   ODs/ODco and ODs/OD(LPC)cratio was 47.1, 52.8 and 34.0\% for sample H,
   56.2, 47.4\% and 34\% for sample M and 84.6, 86.0 and 86.6\% for sample
   L. The average intra-method analytical imprecision was, respectively,
   20.7, 29.8 and 18.6\% for sample H, 24.6, 26.5 and 19.3\% for sample M,
   and 30.6, 28.1 and 20.2\% for sample L. The commercial ELISA methods
   currently used to determine the presence of anti-Scl-70 autoantibodies
   show considerable differences in the quantitative determination. The
   best results for reproducibility analyses have been obtained when the
   values were expressed as a ratio between the ODs of the sample and of
   the common calibrator (ODs/ODLPC). Forward-looking clinical studies that
   can clarify the usefulness of quantitative determination of anti-Scl-70
   antibodies in the monitoring of diffuse scleroderma patients can be
   performed only when standard serum with a known antibody concentration
   and calibration curves for quantitative ELISA measurements are made
   available.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between
   meteorological conditions and the number of emergency department visits
   for asthma in a children's hospital in Ottawa, Canada. A case-crossover
   study design was used. Hospital emergency department visits for asthma
   between 1992 and 2000 were identified based on patients' presenting
   complaints. We obtained hourly measures for the following meteorological
   variables: wind speed, temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative
   humidity, and visibility. Particular emphasis was placed on exploring
   the association between asthma visits and fog, thunderstorms, snow, and
   liquid and freezing forms of precipitation. In total, there were 18,970
   asthma visits among children between 2 and 15 years of age. The number
   of visits and weather characteristics were grouped into 6 h case and
   control intervals. The occurrence of fog or liquid precipitation was
   associated with an increased number of asthma visits, while snow was
   associated with a reduced number (P < 0.05). Stratified analyses by
   season found no association in any of the four calendar intervals
   between the number of asthma visits and visibility, change in relative
   humidity and change in temperature. In contrast, summertime thunderstorm
   activity was associated with an odds ratio of 1.35 (95\% CI=1.02-1.77)
   relative to summer periods with no activity. Models that incorporate
   calendar and meteorological data may help emergency departments to more
   efficiently allocate resources needed to treat children presenting with
   respiratory distress.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Previously, the novel peptides NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA were
   shown to prevent alcohol-induced fetal death and growth abnormalities in
   a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome. This study evaluated whether
   these peptides could prevent long-term alcohol-induced learning
   abnormalities. In addition, because specific cytokines are known to
   effect long-term potentiation, a model of learning at the molecular
   level, we studied the effect of these novel peptides on tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interferon-gamma levels.
   Study design: We used a well-characterized mouse model of fetal alcohol
   syndrome. Pregnant mice were injected on day 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/kg)
   or placebo. Pretreatment with NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA (20 mu g) or placebo
   was given 30 minutes before alcohol. Embryos were removed after 6 hours,
   at which time cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and
   interferon-gamma levels were measured with enzyme-linked immunoassays.
   To test spatial learning, adult offspring from litters that were treated
   with alcohol, control, NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA then alcohol, or NAPVSIPQ +
   SALLRSIPA alone were evaluated for latency to find a hidden platform in
   the Morris water maze.
   Results: Alcohol treatment increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels
   versus control levels (50.0 +/- 3.5 pg/mL vs 32.7 +/- 2.4 pg/mL; P <=
   .001). NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA pretreatment prevented this increase (39.9 9
   +/- 2.8 pg/mL; P < .01), with levels similar to control (P = .1).
   Similarly, alcohol increased interleukin-6 levels versus control levels
   (22.6 +/- 1.4 pg/mL vs 17.3 +/- 0.6 pg/mL; P < .001), and NAPVSIPQ +
   SALLRSIPA prevented this increase (19.1 +/- 1.0 pg/mL; P < .02), with
   levels similar to control levels (P = .2). Interferon-gamma levels were
   not different among the 3 groups (alcohol, 14.6 + 4.9 pg/mL; control,
   17.9 +/- 6.6 pg/mL; alcohol + NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA, 13.6 +/- 4.9 pg/mL;
   P = .2). In the Morris water maze, alcohol-treated groups did not learn
   over the 7-day trial compared with the control group (P = .001). Groups
   that were pretreated with NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA then alcohol learned
   significantly, which was similar to the control group. Groups that were
   treated with only NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA learned significantly earlier,
   with the shortest latency once learning commenced.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is associated with impaired
   endothelial function and increased cardiovascular risk. Insulin
   resistance is a key feature of MS and plays an important role in the
   pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction. Aim of the present study was to
   evaluate the effect of metformin on endothelial function and insulin
   resistance, assessed by the homeostasis model (HOMA-IR, homeostasis
   model assessment-insulin resistance), in patients with MS.
   Methods. Sixty-five subjects (37 men and 28 women, mean age 54 +/- 6
   years) with MS were allocated to receive metformin 500 mg twice daily (n
   = 32) or placebo (n = 33) for 3 months. Before and after treatment we
   assessed endothelial function, using flow-mediated dilatation of the
   brachial artery, and HOMA-IR.
   Results. Patients who received metformin demonstrated statistically
   significant improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation compared
   with those treated with placebo (from 7.4 +/- 2.1\% to 12.4 +/- 1.9\%
   vs. 7.3 +/- 2.5\% to 6.9 +/- 2.7\%, P = 0.0016, metformin vs. placebo
   respectively), without significant effect on endothelium-independent
   response to sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (P =0.32). Metformin improved
   insulin resistance compared with placebo group (HOMA-IR from 3.39 to 2.5
   vs. 3.42 to 3.37; 26\% reduction in HOMA-IR, P = 0.01). An association
   between the improvement in insulin resistance and the improvement in
   endothelial function (r = -0.58, P = 0.0016) was found.
   Conclusion. Metformin improves both endothelial function and insulin
   resistance in patients with MS. These findings support the central role
   of insulin resistance in the development of endothelial dysfunction and
   the role of metformin for the treatment of patients with MS.}},

Abstract = {{In the present investigation the effects of furnished cages and
   small-group-systems on the humerus and tibia breaking strength of two
   different layer lines were analysed in two trials. Each housing system
   contained of two different group sizes. In the first trial a white layer
   line (Lohmann Selected Leghorn: LSL) and a brown layer line (Lohmann
   Brown: LB) both reared in cages were equally distributed among the
   different housing systems but not mixed within a cage. In the second
   trial only a white layer line (LSL) was analysed, but this time half of
   the hens were reared in cages and the other half on the floor.
   Throughout the whole laying period the hens had identical feeding and
   management. In total 852 humerus bones and 855 tibia bones were
   analysed.
   The LB-layer line showed a higher humerus breaking strength than the
   LSL-layer line. Considering the different rearing systems, the LSL-hens
   reared in cages showed higher humerus and tibia breaking strengths than
   the LSL-hens reared on the floor. Between the investigated housing
   systems there were only few differences in bone breaking strength. The
   LB-layer line showed significantly higher humerus breaking strengths in
   the system Aviplus compared to the two small-group-systems. The bone
   breaking strength in the different group sizes did not significantly
   differ. Hens in all investigated housing systems showed a clearly higher
   bone breaking strength compared to conventional cages. Furthermore, the
   breaking strengths of the present investigation were partly comparable
   to those from aviary systems and free range systems. Therefore it could
   be reasoned that, concerning bone breaking strength, furnished cages and
   small-group-systems are an improvement of conventional cages and
   furthermore they could function as an alternative to extensive housing
   systems like aviary or free range.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen consumption by eggs of European pond turtle was determined at two
   constant incubation temperatures of 25 and 28 degrees C during the
   second half of embryogenesis. During development at both temperatures,
   the rate of oxygen consumption initially increased to remain constant
   during the last quarter of embryogenesis. The difference between the
   rates of oxygen consumption at these temperatures decreased during the
   studied period. The coefficient Q(10) for the rate of oxygen consumption
   decreased from 9 to 1.7. At an incubation temperature of 28 degrees C,
   the changes in the rate of oxygen consumption in response to a
   short-term temperature decrease to 25 degrees C or increase to 30
   degrees C depended on the developmental stage and were most pronounced
   at the beginning of the studied period. During late embryonic and first
   2.5 months of postembryonic development, the rate of oxygen consumption
   did not significantly differ after such temperature changes. The
   regulatory mechanisms formed during embryonic development are proposed
   to maintain the level of oxygen consumption during temperature changes.}},

Abstract = {{C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein produced by
   hepatocytes. A minor elevation in the baseline levels of serum CRP is
   considered an indicator of chronic inflammation. In hepatoma Hep3B
   cells, IL-6 induces CRP expression by activating transcription factors
   STAT3 and C/EBP beta. IL-1 synergistically enhances the effects of IL-6.
   The first 157 bp of the CRP promoter are sufficient for IL-1 synergy.
   Previously, NF-kappa B, a transcription factor activated by IL-1 beta in
   Hep3B cells, has been shown to increase endogenous CRP expression. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate the possible action of NF-kappa
   B on the 157 bp of the proximal promoter. In this study we show that
   NF-kappa B requires and acts synergistically with C/EBP beta on the
   CRP-proximal promoter to regulate CRP expression. We located the
   regulatory element that consisted of overlapping binding sites for
   NF-kappa B (p50-p50 and p50-p65) and OCT-1. The kappa B site was
   responsible for the synergy between NF-kappa B and C/EBP beta and was
   also necessary for the CRP transactivation by C/EBP beta through the
   C/EBP site. Mutation of the \#cB site decreased the synergistic effect
   of IL-1 beta on IL-6-induced CRP expression. Basal CRP expression
   increased dramatically when binding of both OCT-1 and NF-kappa B was
   abolished. Combined data from luciferase transactivation assays and EMSA
   lead us to conclude that the binding of OCT-1 to the promoter,
   facilitated by p50-p50 in a novel way, represses, whereas replacement of
   OCT-1 by p50-p65 induces CRP transcription in cooperation with C/EBP
   beta. This model for CRP expression favors the variation seen in
   baseline serum CRP levels in a normal healthy population.}},

Abstract = {{Kanazawa tests the hypothesis, derived from Evolutionary Psychology,
   that men's income enhances their ability to engage in copulation with
   more partners and at a greater frequency. However, the results presented
   in Kanazawa's article fail to appropriately test for interaction effects
   and some of the analyses may suffer from sample-selection bias. I
   reestimate the equations appearing in Kanazawa's study and find (given
   the author's original methodological decisions) evidence in support of
   the evolutionary prediction in only two of the four original analyses.
   Had the same methodological decisions been consistently applied in the
   original study, then only one of the four analyses provides very weak
   evidence in favor of a sex difference in the returns to income.
   Furthermore, I conduct cross-national analyses with International Social
   Survey Program data from four other industrialized nations: Australia,
   Bulgaria, Ireland, and Poland. In only one of the nations (Ireland) and
   for only two of the four dependent variables is there any compelling
   evidence that men with higher incomes have more sex partners. Since the
   term ``sex partner{''} may be ambiguous, I also use data from the
   National Health and Social Life Survey where detailed questions were
   asked that may better measure evolutionarily significant forms of
   copulation. The data are not consistent with the evolutionary
   psychological theory of sexual behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In relation to the problem of the early serpentinization of Ural
   ultramafic rocks, we analyzed the crystal chemistry of lizardite from
   the Kempirsai, Nizhnii Tagil, Voikaro-Syn'inskii, Krakinskii, Nurali,
   Bazhenovskii, Alapaevskii, and Zheltaya Sopka massifs using Moessbauer
   spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction
   analysis (XRD), and microprobe analysis (EMPA). The composition of
   lizardite was demonstrated to inherit many chemical features from the
   primary silicates (first of all, their proportions of Fe and Mg
   concentrations), and the Al2O3 concentration in the rock controls the
   content of this component in lizardite. The degree of Fe oxidation of
   the lizardite samples varies from 50 to 90\%, and the
   Fe-IV(3+)/Fe-VI(3+) proportions (ratios tetrahedrally and octahedrally
   coordinated Fe3+) do not remain unchanged but monotonically increase
   within individual massifs with increasing degrees of serpentinization of
   the rocks. The contents of structural water in most of the lizardite
   samples notably deviates from the stoichiometric values, with the excess
   (or deficit) in water related to the isomorphism of the Fe3+ ion in the
   structure of this mineral. Comparing the results of DTA and Mossbauer
   spectroscopy, we suggest that lizardite is characterized by the
   replacement of octahedrally coordinated Fe3+ according to the scheme
   \{Me-VI(2+),OH-\} -> \{Fe-VI(3+),O2-\} + H(+)up arrow with the
   deprotonization of the nearest OH group and the ensuing distortion of
   the stoichiometric proportions of H2O. The polytype composition of
   lizardite samples from the Urals was determined.}},

Year = {{2005}},

Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that the apparent behavior of geo-materials is
   the representation of the average micro-mechanical behavior of its
   constituents. Constitutive models that do not incorporate these
   micro-mechanical features in calibrating the material parameters cannot
   address various material localization features in large strain problems
   such as shear bands and slope failures, etc. In the absence of such
   micro-mechanical features the calibration of such models may be
   incorrect.
   A rigorous formulation that incorporates these micro-mechanical based
   mechanisms into the general behavior of the saturated soils is presented
   here. The plastic rotation of particles, the interaction of particles,
   the rate dependency, the damage, and the coupling of particles with pore
   fluid pressure are incorporated through the plastic spin, the gradient
   theory, the visco-plasticity, the damage theory, and the coupled theory
   of mixtures, respectively. The link between the micro-mechanical
   mechanisms and the macro-mechanical behavior is made through the use of
   RVE (representative volume element). As a result, a full formulation for
   the micro-mechanics implemented continuum plasticity for saturated soils
   is presented here. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An acidic arabinogalactan-protein (AGP) isolated from an aqueous extract
   of the roots of wild indigo {[}Baptisia tinctoria (L.) R. Br.] by
   precipitation with P-glucosyl Yariv reagent consists Of Larabinose
   (34.0\%) and D-galactose (58.7\%) (1:1.7), minor amounts Of D-glucuronic
   acid (4.0\%) and traces Of D-rhamnose (2.3\%) and D-glucose (< 1\%). The
   protein part of the AGP mainly contains asparagine/aspartic acid
   (11.3\%), glutamine/glutamic acid (10.8\%), alanine (8.0\%), serine
   (8.0\%), leucine (7.0\%) and hydroxyproline (6.3\%). Methylation
   analysis revealed that the carbohydrate moiety of the glycoprotein has a
   highly branched structure. The core consists of 3-linked
   beta-D-galactopyranose units carrying side chains of 6-linked
   beta-D-galactopyranose in position C(O)6, partly substituted in position
   C(O)3 by side chains of 5- and 3-linked U-L-arabinofuranosyl residues
   and 4-linked beta-D-galactopyranose units. Galactose and arabinose as
   well as glucose, rhamnose and glucuronic acid occur in terminal
   positions. The presence of these glycosyl linkage types was confirmed by
   C-13-NMR data. The AGP was separated into two fractions by SEC. The
   major peak corresponded to a hydrodynamic volume of 5.6 x 10(4) Da
   (AGP-F2) and the minor peak to a hydrodynamic volume of 1.2 x 10(6) Da
   (AGP-F1). MALLS revealed apparent weight average molecular masses of 1.4
   x 10(5) Da and > 1.0 X 10(7) Da, respectively. Both fractions show
   corresponding carbohydrate compositions and structural features with
   regard to the carbohydrate moiety. Mild acid hydrolysis of the AGP leads
   to loss of terminal arabinofuranosyl units. The residual galactan
   backbone does not react with the Yariv reagent in gel diffusion tests
   while the total AGP still interferes with the reagent following
   reduction of terminal glucuronic acid residues.}},

   through an anion exchange resin column. This combined process increased
   the production of pure water volume compared to a single process using

   developed in order to exclude chloride ions selectively. Cr6+ solution
   with high purity and low contents of chloride ion was recovered from
   this solution. Based on these experiments, we devised a practical

Abstract = {{A parallel is posited between the ways hybridity and kinship are thought
   about in Western contexts, challenging the idea that kinship and biology
   tend to lead to narrow, roots-oriented, essentialized definitions of

   hybridity, kinship and biology partake of the tension between roots and
   routes that is characteristic of all hybridity. Anthropological evidence
   on the character of Western kinship thinking is examined to elucidate
   some features of its flexibility. Theories of hybridity are seen as
   being themselves a type of kinship thinking.}},

Abstract = {{T cells, in particular CD4+ T cells, have been implicated in mediating
   many aspects of rheumatoid inflammation. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
   CD4+ T cells display various functional abnormalities in the synovium as
   well as in the peripheral circulation. Current evidence suggests,
   however, that the role of CD4+ T cells in the development of rheumatoid
   inflammation exceeds that of activated pro-inflammatory effector T cells
   that drive the chronic autoimmune response. Subsets of CD4+ T cells with
   regulatory capacity, such as CD25+ Tregs, have been identified in mice
   and man, and recent observations suggest that in RA, the function of
   these regulatory T cells is severely impaired. Thus, in RA, defective
   regulatory immune mechanisms might allow the breakdown of peripheral
   tolerance, following which the detrimental CD4+ T-cell-driven immune
   response evolves and proceeds to chronic inflammation. Here, we review
   the functional abnormalities and the contribution of different T-cell
   subsets to rheumatoid inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Ezrin connects the apical F-actin scaffold to membrane proteins in the
   apical brush border of intestinal epithelial cells. Yet, the mechanisms
   that recruit ezrin to the apical domain remain obscure. Using stable
   CACO-2 transfectants expressing keratin 8 (K8) antisense RNA under a
   tetracycline-responsive element, we showed that the actin-ezrin scaffold
   cannot assemble in the absence of intermediate filaments (IFs).
   Overexpression of ezrin partially rescued this phenotype. Overexpression
   of K8 in mice also disrupted the assembly of the brush border, but ezrin
   distributed away from the apical membrane in spots along supernumerary
   IFs. In cytochalasin D-treated cells ezrin localized to a subapical
   compartment and coimmunoprecipitated with IFs. Overexpression of ezrin
   in undifferentiated cells showed a Triton-insoluble ezrin compartment
   negative for phospho-T567 (dormant) ezrin visualized as spots along IFs.
   Pulse-chase analysis showed that Triton-insoluble, newly synthesized
   ezrin transiently coimmunoprecipitates with IFs during the first 30 min
   of the chase. Dormant, but not active (p-T567), ezrin bound in vitro to
   isolated denatured keratins in Far-Western analysis and to native IFs in
   pull-down assays. We conclude that a transient association to IFs is an
   early step in the polarized assembly of apical ezrin in intestinal
   epithelial cells.}},

Abstract = {{A genetic algorithm is used to determine several types of Earth-Mars
   trajectories, with the objective of maximizing payload delivered to
   Mars. The trajectories have three phases: Earth escape, heliocentric
   flight, and arrival into low Martian orbit. The actual planetary orbits
   are used with one approximation: Mars's very small orbit inclination to
   the ecliptic plane is ignored. Impulses provided by chemical rockets are
   used for Earth departure and capture into orbit about Mars. The
   optimizer chooses the magnitude and direction of the impulse explicitly
   for the departure from Earth and implicitly, by choosing the hyperbolic
   excess velocity vector, for the arrival at Mars. The heliocentric flight
   uses low-thrust nuclear-electric propulsion; cases with continuous
   thrust and cases in which a coasting, that is, a no-thrust phase, is
   allowed are both considered. The continuous time history of the thrust
   pointing angle is modeled using a sequence of cubic polynomials whose
   coefficients become parameters of the genetic algorithm's chromosome.
   The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is dynamic; it first
   forces the spacecraft to arrive within the Martian sphere of influence.
   With that accomplished, it then emphasizes optimizing final mass.}},

   surface layer (0-5 cm) and soil profile (0-50 cm) transects were sampled
   at a high resolution at the close of the irrigation season and rainy
   winter season. Samples from 0- to 5-cm transects were subdivided into
   1-cm slices to obtain fine scale resolution of repellency and organic
   matter distribution. Extreme to severe soil water repellency in the 0-
   to 5-cm soil surface layer persisted throughout the 2-yr study period in
   the effluent-irrigated Shamouti orange {[}Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck
   cv. Shamouti] orchard plot. Nearby Shamouti orange plots irrigated with
   tap water were either nonrepellent or only somewhat repellent.
   Repellency was very variable spatially and with depth, appearing in
   vertically oriented ``repellency tongues.{''} Temporal and spatial
   variability in repellency in the uppermost 5-cm soil surface layer was
   not related to seasonality, soil moisture content, or soil organic
   matter content. Nonuniform distribution of soil moisture and fingered
   flow were observed in the soil profile after both seasons, demonstrating
   that the repellent layer had a persistent effect on water flow in the
   soil profile. A lack of correlation between bulk density and volumetric
   water content in the soil profile demonstrates that the observed
   nonuniform spatial distribution of moisture results from preferential
   flow and not heterogeneity in soil properties. Soil water repellency can
   adversely affect agricultural production, cause contamination of
   underlying ground water resources, and result in excessive runoff and
   soil erosion.}},

   alcohol use among motor vehicle crash (MVC) victims admitted to a
   Level-1 trauma center. In a 90-day study, nearly two-thirds of trauma
   center admissions were victims of motor vehicle crashes. Blood and urine
   was collected from 168 MVC victims of whom 108 were identified as the
   driver in the crash. Toxicology results indicated that 65.7\% of drivers
   tested positive for either commonly abused drugs or alcohol. More than
   half of the drivers tested positive for drugs (50.9\%) other than
   alcohol, with one in four drivers testing positive for marijuana use.
   About one-third of those using drugs had also been drinking, but alcohol
   was detected in only 30.6\% of all injured drivers. Within the total MVC
   patient pool, passenger drug/alcohol use was equivalent to the driver
   population; however, injured pedestrians had higher rates of alcohol
   only than other MVC victims. There were no significant differences in
   drug and alcohol use between MVCs and trauma admissions of other causes.
   Of the patients with positive toxicology results, less than half (42\%)
   were referred for evaluation for substance abuse disorders. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{On the battlefield, a properly applied tourniquet can be an extremely
   effective means of controlling severe extremity wound hemorrhage.
   However, a great deal of confusion exists among soldiers, medics, and
   military medical officers on a number of tourniquet-related issues. What
   is an appropriate combat tourniquet? When is it appropriate to use a
   tourniquet? When and by whom should a tourniquet be removed? Under what
   conditions should a tourniquet not be released or removed? What are the
   most effective ways to increase limb salvage while using a tourniquet?
   These and other issues were addressed by a panel of experts at the 2003
   Advanced Technology Applications for Combat Casualty Care Conference,
   August 21 and 23, 2003, St. Pete Beach, Florida. Here we review those

Abstract = {{A novel DNA binding motif, the B3 domain, has been identified in a
   number of transcription factors specific to higher plant species, and
   was recently found to define a new protein fold. Here we report the
   second structure of a B3 domain, that of the Arabidopsis thaliana
   protein, At1g16640. As part of an effort to `rescue' structural genomics
   targets deemed unsuitable for structure determination as full-length
   proteins, we applied a combined bioinformatic and experimental strategy
   to identify an optimal construct containing a predicted conserved
   domain. By screening a series of N- and C-terminally truncated At1g16640
   fragments, we isolated a stable folded domain that met our criteria for
   structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy. The structure of the B3 domain
   of At1g16640 consists of a seven-stranded beta-sheet arranged in an open
   barrel and two short alpha-helices, one at each end of the barrel. While
   At1g16640 is quite distinct from previously characterized B3 domain
   proteins in terms of amino acid sequence similarity, it adopts the same
   novel fold that was recently revealed by the RAV1 B3 domain structure.
   However, putative DNA-binding elements conserved in B3 domains from the
   RAV, ARF, and ABI3/VP1 subfamilies are largely absent in At1g16640,
   perhaps suggesting that B3 domains could function in contexts other than
   transcriptional regulation.}},

Abstract = {{The human corpus luteum (CL) is a highly vascularized, temporarily
   active endocrine gland and consists mainly of granulosa cells (GCs),
   theca cells (TCs), and endothelial cells (ECs). Its cyclic growth and
   development takes place under the influence of gonadotropic hormones. If
   pregnancy does occur, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) takes over the
   function of luteinizing hormone (LH) and, in contrast to LH, extends the
   functional life span of the CL. In this study, we investigated the
   effects of hCG and LH in a spheroidal cell culture model of CL
   development. Our data indicate that GCs secrete factors under the
   control of hCG that increase sprout formation of EC-spheroids. We
   demonstrate that the most prominent of these factors is VEGF-A,
   Furthermore, we found that both LH and hCG decrease sprout formation of
   GC-spheroids. After forming EC-GC coculture spheroids and consequently
   bringing GCs and ECs in close contact, sprouting increased under the
   influence of hCG, however not under LH. These experiments provide
   evidence for an hCG dependent functional switch in the GCs after coming
   in contact with ECs. Moreover, it demonstrates the considerably
   different effects of hCG and LH on GCs although their signaling is
   transmitted via the same receptor. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare bone mineral density (BMD) of American
   Indian/Alaska Native (AVAN) women with that of non-Hispanic white women.
   Design: This cross-sectional study compared mean BMD between AI/AN women
   and a random sample of non-Hispanic white women matched on geographic
   region in the Women's Health Initiative Study, a prospective study of
   postmenopausal women. We analyzed baseline BMD measurements for the
   total hip, spine, and whole body from 139 AI/AN women and 1,431
   non-Hispanic white women.
   Results: Unadjusted mean spine and whole body BMDs were not
   significantly different between the two races. Controlling for age,
   education, and hormone therapy use, adjusted mean BMD was similar by
   race among women who were underweight, normal, or obese. We found a
   significant interaction of race by body mass index on spine (P = 0.003)
   and whole body (P = 0.0003) BMD; thus, analyses were stratified by body
   mass index. Overweight AVAN women had slightly lower adjusted mean whole
   body and spine BMD than overweight non-Hispanic white women (whole body:
   0.97 vs 1.03 g/cm(2), p = 0.02; spine: 0.96 versus 1.03 g/cm(2), p =
   0.001). Among extremely obese (body mass index: >= 40.0 kg/m(2)) women,
   adjusted mean total hip BMD was higher in the AI/AN women (1.07 vs 0.97
   g/cm(2), respectively, P = 0.03).
   Conclusions: Overall, AI/AN and non-Hispanic white women had similar
   BMDs. This study suggests that extremely obese AI/AN women may have
   higher BMD at certain skeletal sites compared with extremely obese
   non-Hispanic white women. However, these results need to be confirmed by
   additional research.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Grains of indica rice (Oryza sativa cv. Peiza 67) exhibit an increase in
   endo-beta-mannanase activity, mostly after the completion of
   germination. According to tissue blots, the initial increase occurs in
   association with the embryo, and possibly the scutellum, although the
   largest sustained increase in activity is in the peripheral regions of
   the endosperm. The aleurone layer, being the only living region of the
   endosperm, is presumably the site of synthesis and secretion of the
   enzyme into the non-living, starch-laden region. beta-Mannosidase
   activity is low throughout germination and subsequent seedling growth,
   particularly in the endosperm regions. Its activity profile does not
   mimic that of endo-beta-mannanase. In the intact grain, gibberellin (GA)
   causes a relatively small increase in endo-beta-mannanase activity,
   while abscisic acid (ABA) causes a large decrease; this inhibition is
   overcome to a considerable extent when GA is supplied along with ABA.
   beta-Mannosidase activity is little affected by either GA or ABA.
   Embryoless half-grains imbibed in water exhibit only a small increase in
   endo-beta-mannanase activity with time of imbibition, showing the
   necessity for a stimulus from the embryo for this to occur. Incubating
   half-grains in the presence of GA results in a large increase in enzyme
   activity; ABA reduces the amount of activity compared to the water
   controls. GA is capable of reversing the inhibitory effect of ABA with
   respect to endo-beta-mannanase activity. As in the intact grains,
   beta-mannosidase activity in the half-grains is unaffected by either GA
   or ABA. It is concluded that the major site for the production of
   endo-beta-mannanase activity is the aleurone layer, and this event is
   influenced by the presence of the embryo; in the absence of the latter,
   the increase in enzyme activity is stimulated by GA. beta-Mannosidase
   activity is low throughout germination and post-germination, it is not
   influenced by GA and ABA, and thus its activity is not regulated in a
   coordinated manner with that of endo-beta-mannanase.}},

Abstract = {{Materials in the Ti-Al-C ternary system commonly contain three
   coexisting phases, Ti3AlC2, Ti2AlC, and TiC. Quantitative phase analysis
   in this ternary system was investigated using X-ray diffraction. First,
   nonoverlap diffraction peaks were selected: the (002) peak at 2
   theta=9.5 degrees for Ti3AlC2 (I/I-0 = 26.5), the (002) peak at 2
   theta=13.0 degrees for Ti2AlC (I/I-0 = 39), and the (111) peak at 2
   theta=35.9 degrees for TiC (I/I-0 = 78), respectively. Then, based on
   the mixing-sample method without internal standards, a set of equations
   was derived for determining the amounts of Ti3AlC2, Ti2AlC, and TiC in a
   sample using the intensities of the selected diffraction peaks. Finally,
   the applicability and error sources for this method were investigated.
   The method is simple and straightforward, and is applicable to the
   entire Ti-Al-C ternary system, since the derivation of this equation

Abstract = {{Using the Fourier transformation method, we accurately solved the Gauss

   interactions decaying as r(-a) on two-dimensional triangular lattices is
   studied. The critical points of the system under these circumstances are
   calculated. According to the results we have obtained, we can easily
   compare the effect of different types of long-range interactions on the
   critical behavior of the system. As will be seen, for the existence of
   long-range interactions, the critical temperature of the system rises to
   some extent. And the effect of the long-range interaction on the

Abstract = {{During August 2001, a field investigation was undertaken to determine
   the hydrocarbon and carbonyl loadings in the Lower Fraser Valley of
   British Columbia, Canada. Intensive ambient air sampling was carried out
   at sites representing urban and rural locales to identify and quantify
   atmospheric levels of non-methane hydrocarbon and carbonyl species.
   Results indicated that in the urban atmosphere (3-h) non-methane
   hydrocarbon levels exceeded 20 parts per billion (ppbv). Rural sites had
   lower levels of non-methane hydrocarbons. The dominant anthropogenic
   hydrocarbon species were propane, butane, 2-methylbutane and toluene.
   The most common biogenic hydrocarbons included isoprene, alpha-pinene,
   beta-pinene and limonene. On average, biogenic hydrocarbons represented
   approximately 23\% of the total hydrocarbon reactivity estimated for the
   airshed in the Lower Fraser Valley. Based on the hydroxyl
   radical-reactivity scale, limonene was determined to be the most
   photochemically relevant species at the urban site in the Lower Fraser
   Valley of British Columbia. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone were
   the dominant carbonyl compounds found in the Lower Fraser Valley.
   Three-hour averaged carbonyls levels reached 10 ppbv (3-h) and resulted
   from both direct emissions and hydrocarbon photooxidation. Atmospheric
   conditions strongly modulated the abundance of hydrocarbon and carbonyl
   compounds. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that mice with a targeted mutation in the Ets-1 gene
   exhibit increased B cell terminal differentiation to IgM-secreting
   plasma cells. Here, we show that mice, formerly described to lack Ets-1
   protein, actually express low levels of an internally deleted Ets-1
   protein. Mice harboring this Ets-1 hypomorphic allele possess very few
   marginal zone B cells and have increased expression of activation
   markers on follicular B cells. Adoptive transfer experiments indicate
   that this activated phenotype can be reversed upon transfer of
   Ets-1-deficient B cells to a wild-type host, suggesting a role for B
   cell-extrinsic factors in regulating the activated state. Supporting
   this observation, the reverse transfer experiment of wild-type B cells
   into an Ets-1-deficient host resulted in increased expression of
   activation markers on the transferred B cells. However, there are also
   cell-intrinsic changes in Ets-1-deficient B cells as demonstrated by
   their increased differentiation to plasma cells in vitro in response to
   stimulation with cytosine-phosphate-guanine DNA sequence-containing
   oligodeoxynucleotide {[}CpG DNA, a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 ligand].
   Consistent with the activated phenotype and increased terminal
   differentiation of Ets-1-deficient B cells, Ets-1 mutant mice develop
   autoimmune disease. Hence, our studies establish Ets-1 as an important
   regulator of peripheral B cell differentiation and B cell responses to
   TLR9 activation.}},

Abstract = {{A reciprocal interaction between the implantation-competent blastocyst
   and the receptive uterus is required for successful implantation.
   Although various molecular pathways are known to participate in this
   cross-talk, a comprehensive understanding of the implantation process is
   still missing. Gene expression studies and genetically engineered mouse
   models have provided evidence that lipid mediators serve as important
   signaling molecules in coordinating the series of events during early
   pregnancy including preimplantation embryo formation and development,
   implantation and postimplantation growth. This review focuses on the
   roles of two groups of lipid mediators, prostaglandins (PGs) and
   endocannabinoids, during early pregnancy. Our laboratory has shown that
   while PGs generated by the cPLA(2)-cyclooxygenase (COX) system are
   essential to ovulation, fertilization, and implantation,
   endocannabinoids are important for synchronizing preimplantation embryo
   development with uterine receptivity for implantation. A better
   understanding of these molecular signaling pathways is hoped to generate
   new strategies to correct implantation failure and improve pregnancy
   rates in women. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To test different models of myofibrillogenesis, we followed live cells
   expressing Green Fluorescent Proteins ligated to either actin or
   alpha-actinin and analyzed stress fibers, premyofibrils, and myofibrils
   in quail myotube cultures. Actin filaments in the three types of fibers
   were compared by analyzing the effects of Latrunculin-A (LatA), a
   monomeric actin binding macrolide drug (M.W. = 422 Daltons), on stress
   fibers in fibroblasts and on myofibrils in skeletal myotubes in the same
   culture. LatA, at low concentrations (0.2 mu M), induced the loss of
   stress fibers in fibroblasts within a few hours and within 10 min when
   Lat-A was increased to 1.0 mu M. The effect was reversible with
   reformation of the stress fibers when the drug was removed. In contrast
   to the Lat-A induced disassembly of stress fibers in fibroblasts,
   assembling myofibrils in the skeletal muscle cells were not affected by
   1.0-mu M concentrations of Lat-A. With increasing concentrations of
   Lat-A (up to 5 mu M), and increasing incubation times, however, the drug
   induced premyofibrils, the precursors of mature myofibrils, to
   disassemble and the accumulation of mature myofibrils to be halted.
   Removal of the drug led to the refortnation of premyofibrils and the
   resumption of myofibrillogenesis in the spreading edges of the myotubes.
   In contrast, the mature myofibrils in the central shaft of the myotubes
   were stable in doses of Lat-A as high as 50 mu M. The newly assembled
   mature myofibrils located adjacent to the premyofibrils at the ends and
   sides of the myotube were intermediate in sensitivity to Lat-A,
   disassembling when exposed to 10 mu M Lat-A for one hour. To determine
   how a change in the actin filaments during myofibrillogenesis might
   confer greater resistance to depolymerization by Lat-A, we stained the
   myotubes with an antibody directed against CapZ, a protein that blocks
   the release of monomer actin from the barbed ends of actin filaments.
   CapZ was absent from premyofibrils. It was distributed uniforrnly along
   nascent myofibrils where F-actin was unstriated, and was localized in a
   clearly striated Z-band pattern in the mature myofibrils where F-actin
   patterns were fully striated. These Lat-A and CapZ results are discussed
   in the context of various models of myofibrillogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are DNA-binding
   nuclear hormone receptors that are upregulated in response to high fat
   diets. PPARs are structurally related to the type II nuclear receptors,
   including the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). To investigate if PPARs
   modulate TR-mediated terminal differentiation of growth plate
   chondrocytes, primary cultures of epiphyseal chondrocytes transiently
   transfected with TR alpha and PPAR gamma expression vectors were treated
   with the PPAR ligands ciglitazone or troglitazone. Forced overexpression
   of PPAR gamma decreased TR alpha 1-mediated transcriptional activity and
   suppressed T3-induced increases in alkaline phosphatase activity and
   type X collagen expression. Similar effects were observed when the cells
   were treated with the PPAR gamma activator ciglitazone or troglitazone.
   Overexpression of retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXR alpha) partially
   restored not only the inhibition of transcriptional activation by PPAR
   gamma but also T3-induced hypertrophic differentiation. These data
   demonstrate that activation of PPAR gamma signaling by either addition
   of PPAR gamma ligands or overexpression of PPAR gamma in growth plate
   chondrocytes inhibits TR-mediated gene transcription and inhibits the
   biological effects of thyroid hormone on terminal differentiation. The
   molecular mechanism involved in this inhibition appears to be
   competition between PPAR gamma and TR alpha for limiting amounts of the
   heterodimeric partner RXR. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   mono-{[}6-N(4-carboxyphenyl)]-beta-cyclodextrin (ACD). The method is
   based on the fluorescence intensity of ACD decreases as the ACD-AA
   supramolecular complexes form. The fluorescence intensity is measured at
   excitation and emission wavelengths of 270 and 352 nm, respectively.
   Under optimum condition, a linear relationship is obtained between the
   fluorescence intensity and the concentration of AA in the range of
   0.05-8.0 mu g ml(-1). The detection limit is 0.012 mu g ml(-1). The
   method has been applied to the direct analysis of AA in real samples
   with satisfactory results. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dose-escalated chemotherapy has proven utility in a variety of treatment
   settings, including preparative regimens before bone marrow or
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, the potential damage
   imposed by aggressive regimens on the marrow microenvironment warrants
   further investigation. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis
   that dose-escalated chemotherapy, with etoposide as a model
   chemotherapeutic agent, activates the transforming growth factor beta-1
   (TGF-beta 1) signaling pathway in bone marrow stromal cells. After
   high-dose etoposide exposure in vitro, Smad3 protein was phosphorylated
   in a time- and dose-dependent manner in marrow-derived stromal cells,
   coincident with the release of active and latent TGF-beta 1 from the
   extracellular matrix. Phosphorylation was modulated by p38 kinase, with
   translocation of Smad3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus subsequent to
   its phosphorylation. Etoposide induced activation of TGF-beta 1 followed
   the generation of reactive oxygen species and required matrix
   metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) protein availability. Chemotherapy effects
   were diminished in MMP2(-/-) knockout stromal cells and TGF-beta 1
   knockdown small interfering RNA-transfected stromal cells, in which
   phosphorylation of Smad3 was negligible after etoposide exposure. Stable
   transfection of a human MMP-2 cDNA into bone marrow stromal cells
   resulted in elevated phosphorylation of Smad3 during chemotherapy. These
   data suggest TGF-beta 1/p38/Smad3 signaling cascades are activated in
   bone marrow stromal cells after dose-escalated chemotherapy and may
   contribute to chemotherapy-induced alterations of the marrow
   microenvironment.}},

Abstract = {{Asphalt concrete has been recognized as an anisotropic material, but the
   degree of anisotropy and its implications for pavement design and
   analysis have not been well understood. This paper illustrates the
   difference between the stress fields of an isotropic and an anisotropic
   pavement under wheel load through analytical solution and finite-element
   simulation for several cases. A servocontrolled true triaxial (cubical)
   testing device was used to test 4-in. cubical asphalt concrete specimens
   under general stress states to characterize the anisotropic properties
   of asphalt concrete. It was discovered that (1) the stiffness of a cored
   field specimen has significant differences in the vertical and
   horizontal direction; and (2) the significant difference may result in
   larger shear stress and tensile stress in a pavement. These findings
   indicate that characterization and modeling of the anisotropic
   properties of asphalt concrete are an important area that deserves
   further investigation.}},

   of composites fracture behaviors, namely tough fracture and brittle
   fracture. With different temperatures and microstructure, the composites
   exhibited different fracture behaviors. From the morphology of fractured
   surface, we can see that carbon fibers'pulling out from matrix was the

Abstract = {{A monolithic compliant mechanism transmits applied forces from specified
   input ports to output ports by elastic deformation of its comprising
   materials, fulfilling required functions analogous to a rigid-body
   mechanism. In this paper we propose a level-set method for designing
   monolithic compliant mechanisms made of multiple materials as an
   optimization of continuum heterogeneous structures. Central to the
   method is a multiphase level-set model that precisely specifies the
   distinct material regions and their sharp interfaces as well as the
   geometric boundary of the structure. Combined with the classical shape
   derivatives, the level-set method yields an Eulerian computational
   system of geometric partial differential equations, capable of
   performing topological changes and capturing geometric evolutions at the
   interface and the boundary. The proposed method is demonstrated for
   single-input and single-output mechanisms and illustrated with several
   two-dimensional examples of synthesis of multimaterial mechanisms of
   force inverters and gripping and clamping devices. An analysis on the
   formation of de facto hinges is presented based on the shape gradient
   information. A scheme to ensure a well-connected topology of the
   mechanism during the process of optimization is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{A self-consistent quantum model is developed to investigate the
   structural enhancement mechanism of field emission (FE) from multilayer
   semiconductor films. Compared with previous two-step FE mechanism, our
   self-consistent model is straightforward to understanding the whole
   tunneling process of the FE from multilayer semiconductor films.
   Calculated results show that FE characteristics can be remarkably
   improved only by structure modulation. The distinct structure effect of
   the FE characteristics mainly result from two reasons: one is the energy
   level shift and the other is effective surface barrier reduction due to
   accumulation of electrons in the occupied states. The present study
   offered new insights in structural effects for field emitters, which
   opened the possibility of carrying field emission research and
   application from an alternative approach.}},

Abstract = {{Our previous observations of changes in the expression of cAMP-dependent
   genes and the cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) in rat testicular
   cells after spinal cord injury (SCI) implied abnormal cAMP signaling as
   one of the mechanisms underlying the effects of SCI on spermatogenesis.
   It was postulated that such effects might contribute to abnormal sperm
   function after SCI. In this study, we examined this possibility. In
   spinal cord-contused (SCC) and -transected (SCX) rats, impaired sperm
   motility was accompanied by an increase in sperm cAMP content. Treatment
   of SCX rats with exogenous testosterone or follicle-stimulating hormone
   resulted in a further decrease in sperm motility, whereas sperm cAMP
   either increased or remained unchanged. These effects differed from
   those in sham control rats that received identical treatments. Results
   of these experiments also demonstrated that impaired sperm motility in
   SCC and SCX rats was accompanied by decreases in sperm viability and
   mitochondrial potential, thus suggesting a possible link between these
   changes. We concluded that impaired sperm motility after SCI was
   associated with decreases in sperm viability and mitochondrial
   potential. These effects occurred in the face of elevated sperm cAMP
   content and changes in its regulation, suggesting that altered cAMP
   signaling events might contribute to impairment of sperm motility and
   perhaps other sperm functions after SCI.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient gene transfer is a key factor in gene therapy. Reducing the
   damage caused by gene transfer to muscle by electroporation is very
   important for its clinical application. Extensive investigation of
   optimal conditions for gene transfer by electroporation is required. The
   parameters used for electroporation, including plasmid concentration;
   injection volume; the plasmid dose of the injection; the concentration
   of saline media; the size of plasmid DNA; the age of the mice; the lag
   time between plasmid injection and electroporation; and the effect of
   repeated gene transfer by electroporation, were systematically
   investigated in the present study. The efficiencies of gene transfer by
   electroporation in normal and rodent models of diabetes were also
   evaluated. We found that electroporation used for non-viral gene
   transfer could be repeated in the same place in the muscle, but the
   expression efficiency was closely related to the muscle damage.
   Increasing pulse times could enhance the efficiency of gene transfer
   with a lower strength of electric field. It was better to use a higher
   plasmid concentration than to use a larger dose of plasmid and repeated
   injection to achieve a high level of transgene expression. Optimal
   conditions varied in different animal models, being milder for diabetic
   mice than for normal mice, and it was also shown that the conditions
   that worked well on these small rodents were not necessarily suitable
   for larger animals. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the
   factors that affect the efficiency of gene transfer into skeletal muscle
   by electroporation. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We present a tumour cell growth process model including a multiplicative
   coloured noise and an additive coloured noise correlated. How the noise
   cross-correlation intensity lambda and correlation time tau can affect
   the steady state properties of tumour cell growth model are discussed by
   solving an approximative Fokker-Planck equation. It is found that the
   increase of noise correlation timer can cause the tumour cell number
   increasing, but the increase of multiplicative noise intensity can cause
   the tumour cell number extinction. We also find that the increase of
   cross-correlation intensity lambda in the case of 0 < lambda < 1 can
   cause the tumour cell number extinction, whereas increase of
   cross-correlation intensity A in the case of lambda < 0 can cause the
   tumour cell number increasing.}},

Abstract = {{In current feature-based parametric design systems, the reusability
   principle is not fully supported as it was expected. Unpredictability
   and ambiguity of models often happen during design modification within
   one system as well as among different systems. This reference deficiency
   significantly reduces the power of feature-based parametric modeling,
   where geometry re-evaluation generates unexpected shapes. In this paper,
   a sufficient condition of B-Rep variance based on geometry continuity in
   parametric complex Euclidean (PC3)-C-p) space is proposed. Shape and
   relation parameters are differentiated in (PC3)-C-p, thus parametric
   family can be defined. A semantic id scheme based oil continuity of
   geometry is developed to solve the problem of naming persistency and to
   improve interoperability of CAD feature modeling. Hierarchical
   namespaces localize entity creation and identification. All geometric
   and topological entities are referred uniformly based on surface ids,
   and topology semantics is retained in id itself. \&COPY; 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present a computation reduction technique called computation sharing
   differential coefficient (CSDC) method, which can be used to obtain
   low-complexity multiplierless implementation of finite-impulse response
   (FIR) filters. It is also applicable to digital signal processing tasks
   involving multiplications with a set of constants. The main component of
   our proposed CSDC method is to combine the strength of the augmented
   differential coefficient approach and subexpression sharing. Exploring
   computation reuse through algorithmic equivalence, the augmented
   differential coefficient approach greatly expands the design space by
   employing both differences and sums of filter coefficients. The expanded
   design space is represented by an undirected and complete graph. The
   problem of minimizing the adder cost (the number of
   additions/subtractions) for a given filter is transformed into a problem
   of searching for an appropriate subexpression set that leads to a
   minimal adder cost. A heuristic search algorithm based on genetic
   algorithm is developed to search for low-complexity solutions over the
   expanded design space in conjunction with exploring subexpression
   sharing. It is shown that up to 70.1\% reduction in the adder cost can
   be obtained over the conventional multiplierless implementation.
   Comparison with several existing techniques based on the available data
   shows that our method yields comparable results for multiplierless FIR
   filter implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Cured natural rubber and polybutadiene elastomers undergo an increase in

   The increase in modulus of typical rubber compounds was studied at room
   temperature and at temperatures moderately above room temperature in
   order to enable the evaluation of the modulus after shelf aging. The
   rate of modulus increase was found to correlate well with storage
   temperature by using an Arrhenius activation energy approach. The marked
   dependence on temperature in the range of 20-70 degrees C suggests the
   possibility of significant acceleration of the timescale of experiments
   using very mild conditions. Data are presented for isothermal and
   step-isothermal aging protocols, which are shown to be reducible to a
   single curve. The effect of the initial cure cycle used to produce the
   specimens is also investigated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{5440-5446}},

Abstract = {{In view of conflicting reports regarding the performance of DGT in low
   ionic strength solutions (I < 1 mM), further investigations have been
   carried out. Minimal washing of the diffusive gel and deployment in 1.0
   and 10 mM NaNO3 solutions containing Cu and Cd gave the theoretical
   response of 1 for {[}C](DGT)/{[}C](SOLN), where {[}C](DGT) is the
   concentration of metal measured by DGT and {[}C](SOLN) is the
   concentration of metal measured directly in the solution by an
   appropriate analytical method. Erroneously high values for
   {[}C](DGT)/{[}C](SOLN) were obtained when these same gels were deployed
   at I = 0.1 mM, presumably due to a net negative charge on the gel,
   attributable to the presence of initiation products of polymerization.
   However, washing the diffusive gels completely, where the storage
   solution pH equaled that of deionized water, gave values of similar to
   0.5 for {[}C](DGT)/{[}C](SOLN) from deployments at I = 0.1 mM,
   consistent with the lower measured value of the diffusion coefficients
   at this ionic strength. These results can be explained by the presence
   of a net positive charge on the gel when it is exhaustively washed,
   which reduces the effective diffusion coefficient of metal ions by
   changing their concentration at the gel-solution interface (Donnan
   partitioning). Diffusive gel equilibration experiments showed the
   presence of low capacity sites capable of binding metals irrespective of
   ionic strength. Ibis binding within the diffusive gel does not affect
   most DGT measurements, as short (4 h) deployments at concentrations of
   10 ppb gave theoretical results. Incomplete washing of the resin-gel
   caused a 5-15\% measurement error and a decrease in precision, even at
   ionic strengths of 10 mM. A high level of accuracy and precision
   (typically < 5\%) was maintained during all aspects of this work, even
   at ionic strengths of 0.1 mM, in contrast to previous results. This is
   attributable to three factors: (1) exhaustive washing and conditioning
   protocols, (2) improvements to the DGT sampling device, and (3) low and
   reproducible blanks due to ultraclean handling procedures. Provided
   effective diffusion coefficients measured at the same ionic strength are
   used, the established DGT theory is obeyed irrespective of ionic
   strength.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the influence of aging on cardiac function by means of

   filling (E) and atrial contraction (A) transmittal flow velocities (E/A)

   of diastolic function. We also measured left ventricular ejection
   fraction (LVEF), and the ratio of pre-ejection period (PEP) and ejection
   time (ET) of the left ventricle (PEP/ET) for assessment of systolic
   function. Both LV E/A and RV E/A decreased significantly with aging
   while LVEF and PEP/ET remained normal range. The decline rate as aging
   was greater in LV E/A than in RV E/A. These results showed that both
   left and right ventricular diastolic function deteriorated with aging
   while left ventricular systolic function was not noticeably affected by
   aging. We suggest that indexes of diastolic function are more sensitive

Abstract = {{Background: Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening (UNHS) has been
   gradually implemented since the mid-nineties in Austrian maternity wards
   and neonatal intensive care units. This study evaluated the effect of
   UNHS on reducing age at identification as well as age of intervention
   for children with congenital and perinatal sensorineural hearing
   impairment.
   Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of clinical data of 394
   Austrian children diagnosed with an at least mild degree (>20dB hearing
   level) of permanent sensorineural hearing loss. Age at identification
   and age at intervention were compared between children who underwent
   UNHS (With UNHS') and those who did not undergo UNHS (without UNHS').
   Results: The median of age of identification was 37.6 months in children
   without UNHS, and 3.9 months in children with UNHS. By six months of
   age, 69\% of hearing-impaired children who underwent UNHS, were
   identified but only 6\% of those without UNHS. At one year, the
   corresponding percentages are 80\% and 12\%, respectively. In children
   without UNHS, the degree of hearing loss was the most predictive factor
   of age at identification (median of age at diagnosis for profound
   hearing loss: 15 months; severe: 26 months; moderate: 52 months; mild:
   73 months). In children with UNHS, age of identification was unrelated
   to degree of hearing loss (medians between 3.7 and 4.4 months). In the
   majority of children intervention began within one month after
   diagnosis, regardless of whether or not the child was identified by
   UNHS.
   Discussion: UNHS greatly increases the proportion of children whose
   hearing impairment is diagnosed before six months of age. However, in
   some 20\% of children, hearing impairment was diagnosed later than one
   year of age, despite having failed the screening. Additionally, data
   from this study suggest that about 15\% of childhood hearing losses
   manifest themselves after the hearing screening period. Efforts are thus
   required for the early detection of these children as well.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic options for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most
   common adult-onset motor neuron disorder, remain limited. Emerging
   evidence from clinical studies and transgenic mouse models of ALS
   suggests that cannabinoids, the bioactive ingredients of marijuana (
   Cannabis sativa) might have some therapeutic benefit in this disease.
   However, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), the predominant
   cannabinoid in marijuana, induces mind-altering effects and is partially
   addictive, compromising its clinical usefulness. We therefore tested
   whether cannabinol (CBN), a nonpsychotropic cannabinoid, influences
   disease progression and survival in the SOD1 (G93A) mouse model of ALS.
   CBN was delivered via subcutaneously implanted osmotic mini-pumps ( 5
   mg/kg/day) over a period of up to 12 weeks. We found that this treatment
   significantly delays disease onset by more than two weeks while survival
   was not affected. Further research is necessary to determine whether
   non-psychotropic cannabinoids might be useful in ameliorating symptoms
   in ALS.}},

   HCl or 1 week after acid in recovery animals. Controls exhibited
   significant regional differences in epithelial thickness, gland volume,

   induced erosive esophagitis and significant epithelial denudation
   throughout the distal 7 cm, combined with significant site-specific
   increases in gland lumen volume, decreases in mast cell numbers, and
   changes in glycoconjugate content. No differences from controls were
   noted in recovery animals, except for a significant increase in
   epithelial thickness and change in glycoconjugate content in the distal

Abstract = {{We have carried out parallel tempering Monte Carlo calculations on the
   binary six-atom mixed Lennard-Jones clusters, ArnXe6-n (n=0,1,2). We
   have looked at the classical configurational heat capacity C-V(T) as a
   probe of phase behavior. All three clusters show a feature in the heat
   capacity in the region of 15-20 K. The Ar2Xe4 cluster exhibits a further
   peak in the heat capacity near 7 K. We have also investigated dynamical
   properties of the Ar2Xe4 cluster as a function of temperature using
   molecular dynamics. We report the interbasin isomerization rate and the
   bond fluctuation parameter obtained from these calculations. At 7 K, the
   isomerization rate is on the order of 0.01 ns(-1); at 20 K, the
   isomerization rate is greater than 10 ns(-1). Furthermore, at 7 K, the
   bond fluctuation parameter is less than 3\%; at 20 K, it is in the range
   of 10-15\% (depending on the sampling time used). Using this
   information, together with Monte Carlo quenching data, we assign the
   15-20 K feature in the heat capacity to a solid-liquid phase change and
   the 7-K peak to a solid-solid phase change. We believe this is the
   smallest Lennard-Jones cluster system yet shown to exhibit solid-solid
   phase change behavior. (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

   migration/invasion by other mechanisms like vitronectin (VN) binding and
   lipoprotein-receptor related protein (LRP) binding. We examined the role
   of PAI-1 to interact with uPA, VN, and LRP in MDA-MB-435 breast cancer
   and SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells in a wound-induced cell migration assay.
   By different experimental conditions with PAI-1, expressed either by
   stable transfection or by adenoviral infection (wild-type PAI-1 and an
   inactive reactive site P14 mutant, T333R) or by addition of recombinant
   PAI-1 and various mutants (stable wild-type, P14 T333R, reactive center
   P1 R346A, reduced VN-binding Q123K, and reduced LRP-binding R76E), we
   found that the PAI-1-VN interaction was foremost in suppressing
   wound-induced cell migration. Likewise, a VN-antibody that blocks cell
   adhesion to VN mimicked the effect of PAI-1 to reduce wound-induced
   SKOV-3 cell migration. However, manipulation of the endogenous
   plasminogen activator system (using blocking antibodies to PAI-1 and to
   uPA) in wound-induced SKOV-3 cell migration demonstrated an important
   role for uPA inhibition by PAI-1 that was dependent on plasminogen. By
   contrast, smooth muscle cell wound-induced migration was promoted by
   exogenously added PAI-1, but this enhancement was dependent on PAI-1
   binding to LRP, not binding to VN. These findings contribute to the
   overall complexity of the role of PAI-1 in regulating cell migration;
   especially since both VN binding and uPA inhibition are involved in
   suppressing wound-induced breast and ovarian cancer cell migration.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research in Gospel Oak indicates high-rates of common mental
   disorder. This paper explores how far deficits in social capital may be
   linked to these rates. Interviews, focus groups and participant
   observation were conducted to assess social capital in Gospel Oak from
   the phenomenological experience of residents. The data suggested that
   most residents perceived the neighbourhood to be rich in well-developed
   facilities, services and associational activity. Residents also
   generally expressed satisfaction with local trust and reciprocity. The
   results do not support the hypothesis that rates of common mental
   disorder in Gospel Oak are linked to deficits in social capital.
   Compositional factors may be more important in accounting for these
   rates. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Let us assume that we are intending to carry out a relatively complex
   verbal interaction, such as buying a car after carefully comparing
   different makes or raising an issue with a local authority. In such
   cases, after the conversation is before the conversation, and after the
   text is before the text - to adapt a phrase popular with sports coaches.
   This means that in very many cases one's aims cannot actually be
   achieved through a single conversation or a single written text but only
   through a series of conversations (dialogues) or a series of texts
   (monologues), in short, through a series of communicates.
   In the context of the entire interaction the closure that is achieved
   through ending a conversation or text is thus of a merely relative
   nature. It is only the sequence of communicates, the series, which
   counts as a complete whole for the persons conducting the verbal action
   and which forms the basic perspective for a pragmatic approach.
   As far as I can see, discourse in the sense of the society-wide
   discussion of a specific topic is in fact also such a series, albeit
   naturally one with highly complex interconnections, so that the series
   as a level would have to be placed above the level of conversation and
   text communicate. As the following discussion is relatively extensive,
   it will be printed in two parts; part two is to be published in the
   December issue of Muttersprache (issue 4/05).}},

Abstract = {{We examined nest-site spacing and selection of nesting cliffs by
   Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) in central West Greenland. Our
   sample included 67 nesting cliffs that were occupied at least once
   between 1972 and 1999 and 38 cliffs with no known history of Peregrine
   Falcon occupancy. We measured 29 eyrie, cliff, and topographical
   features at each occupied nesting cliff and unused cliff in 1998-1999
   and used them to model the probability of peregrines occupying a cliff
   for a breeding attempt. Nearest-neighbor distance was significantly
   greater than both nearest-cliff distance and nearest-occupied distance
   (the distance between an occupied cliff and one occupied at least once,
   1972-1999). Thus, spacing among occupied cliffs was probably the most
   important factor limiting nesting-cliff availability, and, ultimately,
   peregrine nesting densities. Although some unused cliffs were
   unavailable in a given year because of peregrine spacing behavior,
   physical characteristics apparently made some cliffs unsuitable,
   regardless of availability. We confirmed the importance of several
   features common to descriptions of peregrine nesting habitat and found
   that peregrines occupied tall nesting cliffs with open views. They chose
   nesting cliffs with eyrie ledges that provided a moderate degree of
   overhang protection and that were inaccessible to ground predators.
   Overall, we concluded that certain features of a cliff were important in
   determining its suitability as a nest site, but within a given breeding
   season there also must be sufficient spacing between neighboring falcon
   pairs. Our habitat model and information on spacing requirements may be
   applicable to other areas of Greenland and the Arctic, and can be used
   to test the generalities about features of Peregrine Falcon nesting
   cliffs throughout the species' widespread distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The approach to the management of painful chronic pancreatitis has been
   empirical, primarily due to the lack of information about biological
   mechanisms producing pain. To facilitate research into pain mechanisms,
   our aim was to assess a rat model of chronic pancreatitis induced by
   pancreatic infusion of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid as a model of
   painful pancreatitis. Nociception was assessed by measuring mechanical
   sensitivity of the abdomen and by recording the number of nocifensive
   behaviors in response to electrical stimulation of the pancreas.
   Expression of neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and
   substance P (SP) in the thoracic dorsal root ganglia receiving input
   from the pancreas and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the pancreas were
   measured. Rats with pancreatitis exhibited marked increase in
   sensitivity to mechanical probing of the abdomen and increased
   sensitivity to noxious electrical stimulation of the pancreas. There
   were significant increases in NGF protein in the pancreas and in
   expression of neuropeptides CGRP and SP in the sensory neurons from
   dorsal root ganglia receiving input from the pancreas. We have
   established quantitative measures of referred nociception and pancreatic
   hyperalgesia in a rat model of chronic pancreatitis that bears
   histological similarities to the human disease. This model has
   considerable construct, face and predictive validity for the human
   condition. It is of importance for the study of the pathogenesis of pain
   in this condition and can facilitate the development of new therapeutic
   options. (c) 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Abstract = {{Background and objective: Since the introduction of the laryngeal mask
   into clinical practice, various additional supraglottic ventilatory
   devices have been developed. Although it has been demonstrated that the
   laryngeal tube is an effective airway device during positive pressure
   ventilation no clinical study has been performed thus far regarding its
   use in patients with predicted ventilation and intubation difficulties.
   Methods: The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the use of
   the laryngeal tube for temporary oxygenation and ventilation in adult
   patients with supraglottic airway tumours scheduled to undergo a
   pharyngeal-laryngeal oesophagoscopy and bronchoscopy under general
   anaesthesia. In addition to our Standard airway management with face
   mask ventilation and rigid bronchoscopy, all patients were temporarily
   ventilated with an laryngeal tube. Also, in patients requiring laryngeal
   biopsies, endotracheal intubation was performed with a 6.0 mm
   microlaryngeal tracheal tube. Minute ventilation volumes, tidal volumes,
   ventilation pressures, end-expiratory CO2 concentration, oxygen
   saturation and arterial blood gas samples were measured. Results: From
   54 enrolled patients only patients with relevant turnout masses were
   evaluated (n = 23). Mask ventilation was performed without difficulty in
   15 of 23 patients. Mechanical ventilation with the laryngeal tube was
   possible in 22 of 23 patients with an audible leak present in three.
   Conventional endotracheal intubation was successfully performed in 19 of
   23 patients. During face mask ventilation, minute volume, tidal volume,
   ventilation pressure, end-tidal CO2, oxygen saturation and arterial PO2
   were significantly lower and PCO2 significantly higher (P < 0.05, paired
   t-test). No statistically significant differences were noted between the
   laryngeal tube and the microlaryngeal tracheal tube. Conclusions: The
   possibility of difficult ventilation and intubation must always be
   considered in patients with supraglottic airway tumours. In these cases,
   the laryngeal tube can be considered for routine airway management and
   may be useful in the `cannot-intubate' situation although difficulties
   should be anticipated in patients with previous irradiation,
   specifically of the throat area.}},

Abstract = {{The study examines the preponderance and mechanism of mammalian target
   of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in three distinct types of transformed B
   lymphocytes that differ in expression of the EBV genome. All three types
   {[}EBV-immortalized cells that express a broad spectrum of the
   virus-encoded genes (type III latency; EBV+/III), EBV-positive cells
   that express only a subset of the EBV-encoded genes (EBV+/I), and
   EBV-negative, germinal center-derived cells (EBV-)] universally
   displayed activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. However, only the
   EBV+/III transformed B cells displayed also activation of the
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway that is considered to
   be the key activator of mTOR and of the mitogen-activated protein
   kinase/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ ERK
   pathway that coactivates one of the immediate targets of mTOR, p70 S6K1.
   Activation of the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK, but not of the mTOR pathway, was
   inhibited by serum withdrawal and restored by insulin growth factor-I.
   In contrast, activation of mTOR, but not PI3K/Akt and MEK/ ERK, was
   sensitive to nutrient depletion. Both direct Akt (Akt inhibitors I-III)
   and a PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin at 1 nmol/L) suppressed Akt
   phosphorylation without significantly affecting mTOR activation.
   Furthermore, rapamycin, a potent and specific mTOR inhibitor, suppressed
   profoundly proliferation of cells from all three types of transformed B
   cells. U0126, a MEK inhibitor, had a moderate antiproliferative effect
   only on the EBV+/III cells. These results indicate that mTOR kinase
   activation is mediated in the transformed B cells by the mechanism(s)
   independent of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. They also suggest that
   inhibition of mTOR signaling might be effective in therapy of the large
   spectrum of B-cell lymphomas.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate methods were used to predict levels of
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)
   concentrations in plasma from characteristics that included age, diet,
   race, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, and reported body mass
   index (BMI) at several decades of life before blood collection.
   Measurements were available for organochlorine compound
   (organochlorines), cholesterol, and triglycerides in plasma from 1,008
   women participants in a population-based case-control study of breast
   cancer undertaken in 1996 to 1997 on Long Island, NY. Organochlorine
   compound levels were associated with age, race, lactation history, body
   size characteristics, and plasma lipids. PCB predictors also included
   fish consumption. DDE was correlated with current BMI, BMI at every
   decade of age from ages 20 to 60 years, and BMI-gain (from ages 20 or 30
   years to 1997). In contrast, PCBs were correlated inversely with both
   BMI (fifth to seventh decades of age) and BMI-gain. After adjusting for
   covariates, DDE and PCB were both positively associated with BMI and
   inversely with BMI-gain; they were lowest with low BMI, high BMI-gain,
   and longer lactation. This pattern is consistent with a pharmacokinetic
   model that predicts higher body burdens during windows of highest
   uptake, faster elimination of organochlorine compounds in leaner women,
   and lowered levels accompanying BMI-gain. As a result, lifetime intake
   for specific organochlorine compound may lead to different plasma levels
   dependent on changes in body size, absolute intensity of intake, and
   whether exposure is ongoing (i.e., PCB) or long discontinued (i.e.,
   DDE).}},

Abstract = {{Preprocessing of chromatographic and spectral data is an important
   aspect of analytical sciences. In particular, recent advances in
   proteomics have resulted in the generation of large data sets that
   require analysis. To assist accurate comparison of chemical signals, we
   propose two methods for the alignment of multiple spectral data sets.
   Based on methods previously described, each chromatograph or spectrum to
   be aligned is divided and aligned as individual segments to a reference.
   However, our methods make use of fast Fourier transform for the rapid
   computation of a cross-correlation function that enables alignments
   between samples to be optimized. The proposed methods are demonstrated
   in comparison with an existing method on a chromatographic and a mass
   spectral data set. It is shown that our methods provide an advantage of
   speed and a reduction of the number of input parameters required. The
   software implementations for the proposed alignment methods are
   available under the downloads section at http://ptcl.chem.ox.ac.uk/

Abstract = {{Well-aligned nanocrystalline (nc)-Si/SiOx composite nanowires have been
   deposited on various substrates at 120 degrees C using SiCl4/H-2 in a

   the amorphous SiOx nanowires. The nc-Si/SiOx composite nanowires are
   transparent in the range 500-900 nm. Photoluminescence spectra of the
   nc-Si/SiOx composite nanowires have a broad emission band, ranging from
   420 to 525 nm. Water vapor from the chamber wall plays a crucial role in
   the formation of the well-aligned nanowires. A possible mechanism for
   the formation of the composite nanowires is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{This is the second of two observational papers examining drizzle in
   stratiform boundary layer clouds. Part I details the vertical and
   horizontal structure of cloud and drizzle parameters, including some
   bulk microphysical variables. In this paper, the focus is on the in situ
   size-resolved microphysical measurements, particularly of drizzle drops
   (r > 20 mu m). Layer-averaged size distributions of drizzle drops within
   cloud are shown to be well represented using either a truncated
   exponential or a truncated lognormal size distribution. The
   size-resolved microphysical measurements are used to estimate
   autoconversion and accretion rates by integration of the stochastic
   collection equation (SCE). These rates are compared with a number of
   commonly used bulk parameterizations of warm rain formation. While
   parameterized accretion rates agree well with those derived from the SCE
   initialized with observed spectra, the autoconversion rates seriously
   disagree in some cases. These disagreements need to be addressed in
   order to bolster confidence in large-scale numerical model predictions
   of the aerosol second indirect effect. Cloud droplet coalescence removal
   rates and mass and number fall rate relationships used in the bulk
   microphysical schemes are also compared, revealing some potentially
   important discrepancies. The relative roles of autoconversion and
   accretion are estimated by examination of composite profiles from the 12
   flights. Autoconversion, although necessary for the production of
   drizzle drops, is much less important than accretion throughout the
   lower 80\% of the cloud layer in terms of the production of drizzle
   liquid water. The SCE calculations indicate that the autoconversion rate
   depends strongly upon the cloud droplet concentration N-d such that a
   doubling of N-d would lead to a reduction in autoconversion rate of
   between 2 and 4.
   Radar reflectivity-precipitation rate (Z-R) relationships suitable for
   radar use are derived and are shown to be significantly biased in some
   cases by the undersampling of large (r > 200 mu m) drops with the 2D-C
   probe. A correction based upon the extrapolation to larger sizes using
   the exponential size distribution changes the Z-R relationship, leading
   to the conclusion that consideration should be given to sampling issues
   when examining higher moments of the drop size distribution in drizzling
   stratiform boundary layer clouds.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and association of human
   papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the cervix of pregnant women without
   visible signs of genital HPV infection undergoing cesarean deliver), in
   the third trimester and to irivestigate a possible HPV tranmission to
   the fetus.
   METHODS: All women underwent cesarean delivery between 37 and 40 weeks
   of gestation. Cervical samples were taken prior to cesarean delivery.
   Furthermore amniotic fluid, placental tissue, and cord blood were
   sampled and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Hybrid Capture II test
   (Diqeue Corp, Beltsville, IWD) was performed to detect HPV DNA.
   RESULTS: We found that 56 (36.6\%) of 153 women were positive for HPV in
   the cervix. Logistic regression analyses showed a decrease of prevalance
   of HPV infection with increasing maternal age (P = .02). No HPV DNA
   could be detected in the amniotic fluid or cord blood, uhereas eight
   placental specimens were positive, for HPV DNA.
   CONCLUSION: The infection rate in women without clinical symptoms of HPV
   infections is high, but there was no HPV-found in the amniotic fluid and
   in cord blood in women with subclinical infection in the third
   trimester.}},

Abstract = {{Mini-balls are used in bearings of dental drills. As the bearings as
   well as the drills are hot vapour sterilised, the bearings are operated
   under non-lubricated conditions. In the present study, Raman scattering
   experiments show that hot vapour sterilisations of Y2O3 stabilised
   ZrO2-Mini-balls lead to a phase transition from tetragonal to monoclinic
   ZrO2. This phase transition finally causes the failure of
   ZrO2-Mini-balls under the tribological conditions typical for dental
   drills. If, however, the ZrO2-Mini-balls are stabilised using CeO2. such
   hot vapour sterilisation induced phase transitions could not be
   observed. Subsequent tribological experiments prove that CeO2 stabilised
   ZrO2-Mini-balls, produced in a Sol-Gel process, are resistant to
   slip-rolling conditions, if large pores can be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Self-contained pairings of the polyphonic Sanctus and Agnus Dei (as
   distinct from the Gloria and Credo) appear to have been something of a
   rarity in the early 1 5th century, both on the Continent and in England.
   In their catalogue Of 15th-century English liturgical music, Gareth
   Curtis and Andrew Wathey list just five firm Sanctus-Angus pairs for the
   period ca. 1400-ca. 1440. Yet examination of these alleged pairs
   suggests that the status of all but one of them is in some degree open
   to question. Curtis and Wathey's catalogue also includes a number of
   movements, that have been paired either by 15th-century scribes or by
   modern commentators but that have so far failed to convince. Among them
   is a group of eight closely related movements contained in a layer of
   the two oldest Trent Codices (MSS 87 and 92), which comprimises four
   possible pairs. Investigation suggests that all eight movements are
   probably the work of the same composer, ``Bloym,{''} whose name heads
   one of the Sanctus Settings; that in the process of transmission a
   number of the movements became wrongly associated; and that by
   realigning them new and more plausible pairings can be established. The
   establishment of connections between one of these pairings and a Credo
   attributed to Bloym in the same Trent layer raises the possibility that
   all three movements may have been conceived in conjunction with one
   another, and may therefore form a partial or incomplete cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a rare developmental malformation
   often characterized by gelastic seizures, which are usually refractory
   to medical therapy. The mechanisms of epileptogenesis operative in this
   subcortical lesion are unknown. In this study, we used standard
   patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques combined with histochemical
   approaches to study individual cells from human HH tissue immediately
   after surgical resection. More than 90\% of dissociated HH cells were
   small (6-9 mu m soma) and exhibited immunoreactivity to the neuronal
   marker NeuN, and to glutamic acid decarboxylase, but not to glial
   fibrillary acidic protein. Under current-damp, whole-cell recordings in
   single dissociated cells or in intact HH slices demonstrated typical
   neuronal responses to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current
   injection. In some cases, HH cells exhibited a ``sag-like{''} membrane
   potential change during membrane hyperpolarization. Interestingly, most
   HH cells exhibited robust, spontaneous ``pacemaker-like{''} action
   potential firing. Under voltage-clamp, dissociated HH cells exhibited
   functional tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na+ and
   tetraethylammonium-sensitive K+ currents. Both GABA and glutamate evoked
   whole-cell currents, with GABA exhibiting a peak current amplitude
   10-fold greater than glutamate. These findings suggest that human HH
   tissues, associated with gelastic seizures, contained predominantly
   small GABAergic inhibitory neurons that exhibited intrinsic
   ``pacemaker-like{''} behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Neurovascular dysfunction substantially contributes to Alzheimer
   disease. Here, we show that transcriptional profiling of human brain
   endothelial cells ( BECs) defines a subset of genes whose expression is
   age- independent but is considerably altered in Alzheimer disease,
   including the homeobox gene MEOX2 ( also known as GAX), a regulator of
   vascular differentiation, whose expression is low in Alzheimer disease.
   By using viral- mediated MEOX2 gene silencing and transfer, we show that
   restoring expression of the protein it encodes, GAX, in BECs from
   individuals with Alzheimer disease stimulates angiogenesis,
   transcriptionally suppresses AFX1 forkhead transcription factor -
   mediated apoptosis and increases the levels of a major amyloid- beta
   peptide ( Ab) clearance receptor, the low- density lipoprotein receptor
   - related protein 1 ( LRP), at the blood- brain barrier. In mice,
   deletion of Meox2 ( also known as Gax) results in reductions in brain
   capillary density and resting cerebral blood flow, loss of the
   angiogenic response to hypoxia in the brain and an impaired Ab efflux
   from brain caused by reduced LRP levels. The link of MEOX2 to
   neurovascular dysfunction in Alzheimer disease provides new mechanistic
   and therapeutic insights into this illness.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Although a substantial number of studies have shown that
   depressive symptoms predict worse cardiac outcome for patients with
   existing coronary disease, relatively few methodologically rigorous
   studies have examined the relation of depressive symptoms to coronary
   disease incidence in individuals initially free of heart disease in the
   community. Methods: Using multivariable-adjusted sex-stratified Cox
   proportional hazards regression, we examined the association between
   depressive symptoms and incident coronary disease and all-cause
   mortality in 3634 Framingham Heart Study original and offspring cohort
   participants (mean age 52 years, 55\% women) attending a routine study
   examination between 1983 and 1994. Results: Over 6 years, of follow-up,
   83 participants had a hard coronary heart disease event (myocardial
   infarction or coronary death), and 133 died. Depressive symptoms (Center
   for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) >= 16) did not
   predict hard coronary disease events. All-cause mortality, however, was
   directly associated with depressive symptoms. Compared with the lowest
   tertile of CES-D score, multivariable-adjusted risks of death in the
   second and third tertiles were 33\% and 88\% higher, respectively
   (hazards ratio per tertile increment = 1.37, 95\% confidence interval
   1.10-1.71, p for trend = 0.005). Conclusion: These findings underscore
   the importance of further research into the pathogenesis and prevention
   of excess mortality experienced with depressive symptoms.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The plane-strain bulge test is a powerful new technique for measuring
   the mechanical properties of thin films. In this technique, the
   stress-strain curve of a thin film is determined from the
   pressure-deflection behavior of a long rectangular membrane made of the
   film of interest. For a thin membrane in a state of plane strain, film
   stress and stain are distributed uniformly across the membrane width,
   and simple analytical formulae for stress and strain can be established.
   This makes the plane-strain bulge test ideal for studying the mechanical
   behavior of thin films in both the elastic and plastic regimes. Finite
   element. analysis confirms that the plane-strain condition holds for
   rectangular membranes with aspect ratios greater than 4 and that the
   simple formulae are highly accurate for materials with strain-hardening
   exponents ranging from 0 to 0.5. The residual stress in the film mainly
   affects the elastic deflection of the membrane and changes the initial
   point of yield in the plane-strain stress-strain curve, but has little
   or no effect on further plastic deformation. The effect of the residual
   stress can be eliminated by converting the plane-strain curve into the
   equivalent uniaxial stress-strain relationship using effective stress
   and strain. As an example, the technique was applied to an electroplated
   Cu film. Si micromachining was used to fabricate freestanding Cu
   membranes. Typical experimental results for the Cu film are presented.
   The data analysis is in good agreement with finite element calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Winter pears (Pyrus communis) in the United States are produced
   primarily in the Pacific Northwest. Potebniamyces pyri (anamorph
   Phacidiopycnis pyri) is the causal agent of Phacidiopycnis rot, a
   recently reported postharvest disease on pears in the United States.
   Infection of fruit by P. pyri occurs in the orchard, and symptoms
   develop during storage. P. pyri was observed to be associated with
   cankers, dead bark, and twig dieback of pear trees. P. pyri was isolated
   from 40 to 50\% of the twig samples exhibiting dieback symptoms from
   three commercial d'Anjou pear orchards, and 35\% of dying bark samples
   from one orchard. However, little information is available regarding
   pathogenicity of P. pyri on pear trees. To determine the distribution of
   P. pyri, dying and dead bark samples were collected from pear orchards
   in various pearproducing areas in Oregon and Washington, and examined
   for presence of fruiting bodies (pycnidia or apothecia) of P. pyri. In
   the orchard, 2-year-old twigs were wounded using a sterile cork borer
   with or without spraying with a commercial aerosol tissue-freezing
   product at the wound sites. Wounds were then inoculated with either
   mycelial plugs from an agar medium or conidial suspensions of P pyri. In
   a separate experiment, freshly made pruning wounds were inoculated with
   conidial suspensions of P. pyri. Canker development was monitored
   approximately monthly for up to 6 months after inoculation, at which
   time reisolation of R pyri was attempted. P. pyri was found to be
   widespread in the Pacific Northwest. Incidence of trees infected by P.
   pyri based on presence of viable pycnidia in pear orchards ranged from 0
   to 100\%. Monthly tree inoculations in the orchard indicated that R pyri
   in general did not cause cankers on non-cold-injured, wound-inoculated
   twigs, but apparently became established on coldinjured,
   wound-inoculated twigs and caused small cankers. Minor dieback developed
   on twigs inoculated at pruning wounds. At 6 months after inoculation, P
   pyri was recovered from the majority of inoculated twigs. Thus, P. pyri
   appears to be a weak canker-causing pathogen on pear trees.}},

Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{634-640}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for erectile
   dysfunction (ED), but the mechanisms are not completely understood.
   Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is reduced in rabbit corporal
   tissue with cholesterol feeding. VEGF signaling leads to the
   phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-Akt and
   p-eNOS).
   Material and Methods. New Zealand White rabbits (n = 50) were fed a 1\%
   cholesterol (n = 8, 8, 8, 4) or normal (n = 6, 6, 6, 4) diet for 2, 4.5,
   7.5, and 12 weeks. Akt, p-Akt, and p-Akt/Akt were measured by
   enzyme-linked immumosorbent assay. Levels of eNOS, p-eNOS, and neuronal
   and inducible nitric oxide synthase (nNOS and iNOS) mRNA and protein
   were assessed by polymerase chain reaction and Western analysis.
   Results. Cholesterol feeding was associated with a significant decrease
   in p-Akt/Akt 2.16-fold (P < 0.05), 3.28-fold (P < 0.02), and 3.42 -fold
   (P < 0.02) at 4.5, 7.5, and 12 weeks., respectively. The reduction in
   p-Akt/Akt with the cholesterol diet at 2 weeks was not significantly
   different, but the correlation between the duration of cholesterol
   feeding and the reduction in p-Akt/Akt was high (r(2) = 0.858). eNOS
   protein or mRNA did not change with cholesterol feeding, but p-eNOS was
   significantly decreased at 4.5 weeks and all subsequent time points.
   nNOS mRNA and protein levels were decreased at 4.5 weeks and all
   subsequent time points, while iNOS was not different between groups.
   Conclusions. Hypercholesterolemia results in decreased VEGF signaling
   and decreased levels of the active form of eNOS in corporal tissue.
   Levels of nNOS were reduced by a different mechanism. VEGF signaling may
   provide a target to modulate ED.}},

Abstract = {{We report the observation of B--> J/psi Lambda(p) over bar and searches

   decays, using a sample of 275x10(6) B (B) over bar pairs collected with
   the Belle detector at the Upsilon(4S) resonance. We observe a signal of
   17.2 +/- 4.1 events with a significance of 11.1 sigma and obtain a
   branching fraction of B(B--> J/psi Lambda(p) over bar)=11.6 +/-
   2.8(stat)(-2.3)(+1.8)(sys)x10(-6). No signal is found for either of the
   two decay modes, B--> J/psi Sigma(0)(p) over bar and B-0-> J/psi p (p)
   over bar, and upper limits for the branching fractions are determined to
   be B(B--> J/psi Sigma(0)(p) over bar)< 1.1x10(-5) and B(B-0-> J/psi p
   (p) over bar)< 8.3x10(-7) at 90\% confidence level.}},

Abstract = {{A water-saturated ionic liquid has been exploited for resolution of (R,
   S)-Naproxen by lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis to enhance the conversion and
   facilitate product recovery. From the enantioselectivity and activity of
   lipase, water-saturated {[}bmim]PF6 (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
   hexafluorophosphate) was selected as the best reaction medium. To
   prevent the dissolution of lipase in the ionic liquid, a weakly polar,
   amorphous multiporous silica YWG-C6H5 was used as a support for
   immobilization. The production of (S)-Naproxen was initially performed
   in a batch reactor containing 20 mL of substrate solution. After 72 h
   reaction, 98.2\% enantiomeric excess of the (S)-Naproxen was obtained
   with 28.3\% hydrolysis conversion. The unconventional solvent properties
   of ionic liquids have been exploited in reaction medium recycling,
   product recovery and water recruiting schemes. In a repetitive batch
   reaction system, the immobilized lipase could be repeatedly used for 5
   times with only a slight reduction in reaction conversion.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic characteristics of an electron accelerated by ultraintense

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a multi-dimensional Markov model to analyse the
   performance of the IEEE 802.11 e EDCF MAC protocol. Based on this model,
   we present extensive performance evaluation in terms of throughput,
   throughput ratios, and access delay of flows of distinct priorities
   under RTS/CTS mode. We also provide quantitative analysis of the impact
   of prioritized parameters, i.e. Arbitration InterFrame Space (AIFS),
   Contention Window (CW) on Quality of Service (QoS) differentiation. The
   accuracy of the proposed model is verified by means of comparing the
   numerical results obtained from both analytical model and simulations.
   Our research can be used as a guideline for the prediction of how flows
   belonging to a certain Traffic Category (TC) perform with their
   TC-specific parameters, as well as designing EDCF-based WLANs and tuning
   the parameters to achieve the desirable differentiated QoS objectives.

Abstract = {{Infrared (1.2-1.6 mu m) luminescence in a ytterbium aluminium garnet

   observed with its peak at 1.34 mu m and measured to be about 1.3 times
   with respect to Yb3+ IR luminescence (lambda = 1.03 mu m). We
   demonstrate that for the excitation wavelength of 940 nm Yb3+ ions act
   as sensitizers of the B-3(2)(T-3(2))-B-3(1)((3)A(2)) emission of Cr4+
   ions. This crystal is promising as a high-efficient system for tunable

Abstract = {{An arginine specific protease, Sp-protease, was purified by column
   chromatography from freeze-dried Spirulina platensis using a five-step
   process. Purified Sp-protease has a molecular weight of 80 kDa. It
   hydrolyzed the synthetic substrates containing arginine residue in the
   P1 position but did not hydrolyze synthetic substrates containing other
   amino acid residues, including lysine residue in the PI position. Among
   the synthetic substrates tested, a substrate of plasminogen activator
   (Pyr-Gly-Arg-MCA) was hydrolyzed most effectively with the enzyme (K-m =
   5.5 x 10(-6) M), and fibrin gel was solubilized via activation of
   intrinsic plasminogen to plasmin with the enzyme. Activity was inhibited
   completely with camostat mesilate (K-i = 1.1 x 10(-8) M) and leupeptin
   (K-i = 3.9 x 10(-8) M) but was not inhibited with N-alpha-tosyl-L-lysine

Abstract = {{We investigate the impact of symbol rate control, modulation level
   control, and the number of hops on the area spectral efficiency of
   interference-limited multihop radio networks. By controlling symbol rate
   and modulation level, data rate can be adapted according to received
   power, In addition, varying the number of hops can control received
   power. First, we evaluate the achievable end-to-end throughput of
   multihop transmission assuming symbol rate and modulation level control.
   Numerical results reveal that by controlling symbol rate or using
   multihop transmission, the end-to-end communication range can be
   extended at the cost of end-to-end throughput, and this may result in
   lower area spectral efficiency. Next, an expression for the area
   spectral efficiency of multihop radio networks is derived as a function
   of the number of hops and the end-to-end throughput. Numerical results
   also reveal that the resulting area spectral efficiency depends on the
   specific circumstances, which, however, an be increased only by using
   multihop transmission.}},

Abstract = {{In the sea urchin embryo, micromeres have two distinct functions: they
   differentiate cell autonomously into the skeletogenic mesenchyme cells
   and act as an organizing center that induces endomesoderm formation. We
   demonstrated that micro1 controls micromere specification as a
   transcriptional repressor. Because micro1 is a multicopy gene with at
   least six polymorphic loci, it has been difficult to consistently block
   micro1 function by morpholino-mediated knockdown. Here, to block micro1
   function, we used an active activator of micro1 consisting of a fusion
   protein of the VP16 activation domain and the micro1 homeodomain.
   Embryos injected with mRNA encoding the fusion protein exhibited a
   phenotype similar to that of micromere-less embryos. To evaluate micro1
   function in the micromere, we constructed chimeric embryos composed of
   animal cap mesomeres and a micromere quartet from embryos injected with
   the fusion protein mRNA. The chimeras developed into dauerblastulae with
   no vegetal structures, in which the micromere progeny constituted the
   blastula wall. We also analyzed the phenotype of chimeras composed of an
   animal cap and a mesomere expressing micro1. These chimeras developed
   into pluteus larvae, in which the mesomere descendants ingressed as
   primary mesenchyme cells and formed a complete set of skeletal rods. The
   hindgut and a part of the midgut were also generated from host
   mesomeres. However, the foregut and nonskeletogenic mesoderm were not
   formed in the larvae. From these observations, we conclude that micro1
   is necessary and sufficient for both micromere differentiation and
   mid/hindgut-inducing activity, and we also suggest that micro1 may not
   fulfill all micromere functions.}},

   Ionic polymers with this formulation were synthesized to contain a
   monomer with pendant siloxane groups in order to get compatibility with
   the silicone matrix of the intraocular lenses. Anchorage of the ionic
   polymer at the surface of the silicone implant was achieved by a

Abstract = {{Gain-of-function mutation of the K-ras gene is one of the most common
   genetic changes in human tumors. In tumors carrying K-ras mutation, the
   presence of oncogenic K-Ras is necessary for maintenance of the
   transformed phenotype. ESXR1 is a human paired-like
   homeodomain-containing protein expressed primarily in the testis. In
   cells, the 65-kDa full-length ESXR1 protein is proteolytically processed
   into an N-terminal 45-kDa fragment containing the homeodomain, which
   localizes exclusively within the nucleus, and a C-terminal 20-kDa
   fragment consisting of a proline-rich repeat region, which is located in
   the cytoplasm. In this work, we demonstrated that the N-terminal ESXR1
   fragment specifically recognizes the TAATNNNATTA P3 consensus sequence
   for the paired-like homeodomain and functions as a sequence-specific
   transcriptional repressor. We also showed that the N-terminal ESXR1
   fragment binds to the TAATGTTAT TA sequence present within the first
   intron of the human K-ras gene and inhibits its expression at both mRNA
   and protein levels. Ectopic expression of the N-terminal ESXR1 fragment
   in human carcinoma cells that carry mutated K-ras reduces the level of
   K-Ras and thereby inhibits the tumor cell proliferation. Identification
   of ESXR1 as a transcriptional repressor of K-ras has an important
   implication for the development of cancer therapy that inhibits
   oncogenic K-Ras expression.}},

Abstract = {{In the sand-casting magnesium alloys Mg-5Al-0.4Zn-0.2Mn-Sr-Ti-xCa,
   existed alpha-Mg, (alpha+ Al2Ca) eutectic and Mg17Al12 when x=0.37,
   0.70, 0.93, 1.69, or alpha-Mg and (alpha+(Mg, Al)(2)Ca) eutectic when
   x=2.93. With increasing x, the room temperature mechanical properties
   (Ob, 6) of the alloys decreased, meanwhile the strength at 200 degrees C
   increased first and then decreased slightly, and the elongation
   decreased rapidly. The yield strength at 200 degrees C (sigma(0.2,200
   degrees C)) of the alloys was greatly improved with the increase of x
   value. DSC analysis proved that the thermal stability of Mg17Al12 phase
   was improved by dissolution of Ca. The grain boundary strength at 200
   degrees C was improved through the formation of the Al2Ca or (Mg,
   Al)(2)Ca phases at the grain boundary. TEM analysis shows that the
   dislocations slip not only at the basal slip plane (0001), but also at
   the (10 (1) over bar0) prismatic slip plane and ((1) over bar(1) over
   bar 21) pyramidal slip plane at 200 degrees C. The dislocation can be
   piled up by Al2Ca phases at the grain boundary resulting in the higher
   yield strength of the alloy containing Ca than those without Ca at 200
   degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the quantum Zakharov equations and the existence of

   use the so-called sech and tanh expansion method, and obtain several new
   quantum solitary wave solutions, such as the bright soliton, gray
   soliton, W-soliton and M-soliton. In contrast to the classical Zakharov
   equations, in the case of quantum Zakharov equations, the terms
   proportional to H-2 modified the dispersion-nonlinearity equilibrium,
   which is the ultimate responsible for the existence of solitons.
   Furthermore, changing H may affect the nature of the solutions in a
   fundamental way. In addition, some properties of the quantum solitons
   that we obtained in the fully nonlinear quantum waves are different from
   those in the weakly nonlinear limit}},

Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive spectral analysis of black hole X-ray
   binaries, LMC X-1 and X-3, based on BeppoSAX observations. We test both
   the multicolour disc plus power-law (MCD+PL) model and a newly developed
   Monte Carlo simulation-based model for a Comptonized MCD (CMCD) with
   either a spherical or a slab-like corona, by comparing the inferred
   parameters with independent direct measurements. While all models give
   an adequate description of the spectra, we find a significant
   discrepancy between the MCD+PL inferred X-ray-absorbing gas column
   density and the absorption-edge measurement based on dispersed X-ray
   spectra. The MCD+PL fits to the LMC X-I spectra also require a change in
   the inner disc radius during the BeppoSAX observation, which may be due
   to the unphysical effects inherited in the model. In contrast, the CMCD
   model with the spherical corona gives predictions of both the disc
   inclination angle and the absorption that are consistent with the direct
   measurements, and only slightly underpredicts the black hole mass of LMC
   X-3. The model explains the spectral state evolution of LMC X-1 within
   the BeppoSAX observation as a change in the accretion rate, which leads
   to an increase in both the inner disc temperature and the Comptonization
   opacity. On the other hand, the CMCD model with the slab-like corona is
   more problematic in the test and is thus not recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Two native trees and one introduced tree in the coast forest ecosystem
   in southwestern Washington state were identified as new host records for
   the western cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis indifferens Curran (Diptera:
   Tephritidae), in 2002 and 2003. Key life history characteristics of
   flies on or from the new hosts also were examined. Rearing of larvae to
   adults confirmed native cascara, Rhamnus purshiana DC.; black hawthorn,
   Crataegus douglasii Lindl.; and introduced cherry laurel, Prunus
   laurocerasu. L., are suitable developmental hosts. In addition, two
   flies reared from cascara bad wing patterns apparently not reported
   previously, with one keying out to R. indifferens. The numbers of larvae
   that emerged from fruit of the new hosts and a known host, bitter
   cherry, Prunus emarginata (Dougl. ex. Hook) D. Dietr., were lower than
   from fruit of sweet and sour cherries, Prunus avium (L.) L. and Prunus
   cerasus L. Seasonal patterns of adult abundance in cascara, black
   hawthorn, and cherry laurel as determined by catches on unbaited sticky
   yellow panel traps were similar to those in bitter cherry, with most
   flies caught beginning in mid-July after fruit were no longer green.
   Fruit of all hosts ripened at similar times. On cascara and black
   hawthorn, R. indifferens was observed feeding on damaged fruit, and on
   black hawthorn, flies mated with the non-native apple maggot, Rhagoletis
   pomonella (Walsh). The longevity of flies reared from cascara, bitter
   cherry, and sweet and sour cherry was similar, averaging 55.5-83.4 d,
   and was higher than that of flies reared from cherry laurel, which
   averaged <= 46.2 d. Body mass of flies from cascara, cherry laurel, and
   bitter cherry was lower than that of flies from sweet cherry. In
   contrast to the coast forest ecosystem, neither cascara nor cherry
   laurel was found at sites studied in ponderosa pine and
   sagebrush-bunchgrass ecosystems in central Washington in 2003 and 2004.
   Adults were not caught on unbaited traps in black hawthorns in these two
   ecosystems, and no larvae were reared from hawthorn fruit from either
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{A cohort of patients with intraductal growth-type intrahepatic
   cholangiocarcinoma (IG-ICC and its precursor lesions, collectively
   termed intraductal papillary neoplasm of the liver (IPNL), was
   characterized with respect to demographics, clinical manifestations,
   perioperative management, long-term survival, and molecular features
   associated with carcinogenesis. A total of 122 patients with IpNL types
   1 through 4, 108 patients with non-IG-ICC and 210 patients with
   hepatolithiasis alone were studied. Expression of CDX2, TFF1, MUC1,
   MUC2, MUC5AC, EGFR, and p53 was determined by using
   immunohistochemistry. Females predominated in those with hepatolithiasis
   alone and IPNL. The mean age of patients with hepatolithiasis alone was
   6 to 8 years younger than that of those with IPNL. The association with
   hepatolithiasis in patients with IPNL types 1 and 2, IPNL types 3 and 4,
   and non-IG-ICC was 100\%, 79\%, and 64\%, respectively. Mucobilia,
   anemia, and elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels were helpful
   in distinguishing IG-ICC and its precursor lesions. The mean survival of
   patients with IPNL type 3, IPNL type 4, and non-IG-ICC was 55.5 months,
   36.9 months, and 15.8 months, respectively. The incidence of expression
   of CDX2 and TFF1 was maximal in IPNL type 3. Expression and cellular
   distribution of MUC2 and CDX2 were similar. MUC5AC was strongly
   expressed in all patients with IPNL; EGFR and p53 were rarely expressed
   in patients with IPNL. In conclusion, hepatolithiasis appears to be a
   precipitating factor in the development of IPNL. Signs of mucobilia were
   specific for the diagnosis of IPNL. Expression of CDX2 and MUC2 are
   helpful in differentiating IPNL and non-IG-ICC. Significant differences
   in survival associated with the various lesions studied warrants a more
   aggressive surgical strategy in their management.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a toll pricing framework for a general
   variable demand traffic assignment problem with side constraints, where
   the demand between an origin destination pair is a function of the least
   total travel cost for making the trip. This general demand model unifies
   earlier toll pricing treatments of the variable demand models including
   elastic demand traffic assignment problems and combined distribution
   assignment problems. All of these models have the constant toll revenue
   property. Given that users experience the side constraints, we show that
   when they are charged by a toll vector in the first best toll set, the
   system optimal flows and demands are achieved. We then present a toll
   pricing framework by which a traffic planner might find the most
   appropriate toll vector given certain restrictions and objectives on the
   network. Finally, we derive the toll sets and illustrate the toll
   pricing framework for specific instances of the general variable demand
   models. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The cantilever-type local deformation transducer (cantilever-LDT) was
   developed as an alternative local axial strain measurement device for
   triaxial testing. The transducer behaves as a cantilever beam and the
   deflection at its free-end is measured by the output from the strain
   gages attached near the fixed-end. By placing two cantilever-LDTs along
   the same vertical alignment but at different levels of a specimen, the
   local axial strain is obtained from the relative movements of two
   cantilever-LDTs. The advantages over the original-LDT proposed by Goto
   et al. (199 1) are: (i) a linear calibration curve, (ii) capability to
   release itself at large strains, and (iii) larger working range. With a
   gage length of 50 mm, the resolution, accuracy, and working range are
   0.0012 \%, 0.003 \%, and 6 \%, respectively. The triaxial test results
   on heavily overconsolidated clay specimens show that the cantilever-LDT
   can be used satisfactorily to measure the local axial strain accurately,
   but the reliability depends very much on the quality of specimen
   preparation and setup.}},

Abstract = {{A new flow system to pre-concentrate and determine reactive mercury in
   effluents by photometry is presented. The system is based on the
   reduction of the reactive mercury present in a 500 mL sample with a
   Sn(H) solution. The reduced mercury is swept out by an argon stream and
   carried to a straight glass tube (60 cm long, 3 mm i.d.) inclined in an
   angle of 15 degrees. The inner surface of this tube has been previously
   covered by a renewable liquid layer of an oxidant solution containing
   H2O2 (12\%, m/v) and HNO3 (3.0 mol L-1) produced after introduction and
   passage of a liquid monosegment containing those reagents. The swept
   Hg-0 undergoes an oxidative process and the Hg(H) formed is retained in
   the layer. After a 10 min sweep time interval the argon flow is stopped
   and a reagent monosegment (350 mu L) containing PAR
   {[}4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol], 1.0 X 10(-3) mol L-1, in an
   ammonia/ammonium chloride buffer (4.0 mol L-1; pH 9.0) is introduced and
   passes through the glass tube. A strongly coloured complex between PAR
   and Hg(II) is formed and carried to the detection system composed of a
   light emitting diode (LED, lambda(max) = 525 nm) and a photodiode
   detector. Sample processing time is about 12 min. The system is washed
   and a fresh liquid layer is formed, preparing the system for a new
   determination. This method concentrates the sample by a factor of 148

Abstract = {{A new coupled finite element and Hankel integral transform formulation
   is developed for the non-linear transient analysis of floating thin
   circular plates subjected to shock loads. Using Kirchhoff thin plate
   theory, an axisymmetric ring is formulated, which takes into account
   geometric and material non-linearities as well as strain-rate effects.
   The fluid pressure field due to the fluid-structural interaction is
   calculated by solving the integral equations in the context of an
   element discretization method. Velocity function of the plate is
   interpolated by nodal velocity using Lagrange polynomials. The
   time-dependent solution of the coupled fluid-structure system is solved
   by applying a staggered solution algorithm at each time step in a direct
   time-integration procedure. To verify the method, results are compared
   with the hydro, code LS-DYNA and good agreement is obtained.
   Furthermore, the influence of media density on the final deformation is
   analyzed. It is shown that the damping effect of the fluid reduces the
   deformation and stress of the plate greatly, especially for thin plates.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a simple and easily adaptable deadlock avoidance
   algorithm for an automated guided vehicle (AGV) system is presented.
   This algorithm uses the graph-theoretic approach. Unlike Petri-net-based
   methods, which are complex and static, it is easy to modify the existing
   model as the configuration of the system changes. Therefore, it is
   suitable for the AGV system in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) and
   a retail or postal distribution center. Moreover, because it is very
   simple, it is appropriate for real-time control mechanisms.
   This paper consists of two parts: the first part presents an AGV
   deadlock avoidance algorithm that uses the graph-theoretic approach, and
   the second suggests appropriate routing strategies based on the proposed
   algorithm. The results show that this deadlock avoidance algorithm can
   be modified easily whenever the configuration of an FMS changes and
   provide high-performance on the deadlock avoidance. Finally,
   experimental results that confirm the validity of this approach are

Abstract = {{Objectives: Functional MRI (fMRI) has become an important imaging
   modality for analyzing the neural mechanisms underlying schizophrenia.
   Earlier studies indicate that patients with schizophrenia tend to
   generate involuntary and unnecessary head motion during visual tasks.
   Since head motion can deteriorate the quality of fMRI data, an
   investigation was needed to examine the type and extent of head motion
   from patients with schizophrenia undergoing fMRI.
   Methods: Patients with schizophrenia and demographically-matched healthy
   comparison subjects underwent fMRI examination involving visual working
   memory tasks. We obtained head movement parameters (three translational
   and three rotational) through mathematical realignment of the volumetric
   image data, and transformed these parameters into head displacement
   indices to quantify the subject's head motion in space.
   Results: We found no group difference in displacement indices between
   the two groups. Group comparison of movement parameters indicated that
   the patient group showed reduced head motion along the superior-inferior
   direction when compared to healthy individuals.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that cognitive fMRI examination in
   patients with schizophrenia can be successfully conducted without the
   deteriorative effects of head motion. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and

Abstract = {{A numerical model to simulate non-isothermal generalized Newtonian flow
   inside a deep-channel twin-screw cheese stretcher was developed. System
   variables (SME, MRT and TE) of the process were defined and mathematical

   The stretcher-cooker geometry and operating conditions strongly
   influence the system variables. Therefore, the stretcher-cooker geometry
   and operating conditions can be adjusted to control the process towards
   a desirable end. The technique developed in this study can help to
   improve the stretcher-cooker design and to optimize the pasta filata

   instructional strategy for the support of students' learning of physics
   experiments was examined in the study. Forty-two university freshmen
   participated in the study for a whole semester. A constant comparison
   method adopted to categorize students' qualitative data indicated that
   the influences of multiple-choice question construction were evident in
   several significant ways ( promoting constructive and productive
   studying habits; reflecting and previewing course-related materials;
   increasing in-group communication and interaction; breaking passive
   learning style and habits, etc.), which, worked together, not only
   enhanced students' comprehension and retention of the obtained
   knowledge, but also helped distil a sense of empowerment and learning
   community within the participants. Analysis with one-group t-tests,
   using 3 as the expected mean, on quantitative data further found that
   students' satisfaction toward past learning experience, and perceptions
   toward this strategy's potentials for promoting learning were
   statistically significant at the 0.0005 level, while learning anxiety
   was not statistically significant. Suggestions for incorporating
   question-generation activities within classroom and topics for future

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing instruments such as SeaWiFS and MODIS are often
   calibrated or tested by comparison with in situ data. These comparisons
   are based on the premise that there is uniform in-pixel variation of the
   standard deviation of in situ properties. To evaluate some of the errors
   resulting from this assumption, we conducted an analysis of in-pixel
   variation of chl a fluorescence by examining fluorescence data from a
   flow-through system on an underway vessel mapping surface properties for
   10 days on the continental shelf in the vicinity of the Mississippi
   River delta. Significant variations of in-pixel standard deviation of
   chl a fluorescence were observed, which indicate that this uniformity
   assumption is not valid in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Furthermore, our
   analysis indicates that a large apparent error by the remote sensor is
   generated if uniformity of standard deviation is assumed. Our results
   suggest that one should take into account both in-pixel mean and
   standard deviation, when comparing remotely sensed ocean color data with
   in situ measurements. Similar measures should be taken when comparing
   other remotely sensed products with field determinations. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{We study several algorithms to simulate bone mass loss in
   two-dimensional and three-dimensional computed tomography bone images.
   The aim is to extrapolate and predict the bone loss, to provide test
   objects for newly developed structural measures, and to understand the
   physical mechanisms behind the bone alteration. Our bone model approach
   differs from those already reported in the literature by two features.
   First, we work with original bone images, obtained by computed
   tomography (CT); second, we use structural measures of complexity to
   evaluate bone resorption and to compare it with the data provided by CT.
   This gives us the possibility to test algorithms of bone resorption by
   comparing their results with experimentally found dependencies of
   structural measures of complexity, as well as to show efficiency of the
   complexity measures in the analysis of bone models. For two-dimensional
   images we suggest two algorithms, a threshold algorithm and a virtual
   slicing algorithm. The threshold algorithm simulates bone resorption on
   a boundary between bone and marrow, representing an activity of
   osteoclasts. The virtual slicing algorithm uses a distribution of the
   bone material between several virtually created slices to achieve
   statistically correct results, when the bone-marrow transition is not
   clearly defined. These algorithms have been tested for original CT 10 mm
   thick vertebral slices and for simulated 10 mm thick slices constructed
   from ten I mm thick slices. For three-dimensional data, we suggest a
   variation of the threshold algorithm and apply it to bone images. The
   results of modeling have been compared with CT images using structural
   measures of complexity in two- and three-dimensions. This comparison has
   confirmed credibility of a virtual slicing modeling algorithm for
   two-dimensional data and a threshold algorithm for three-dimensional
   data.}},

   evaluated Taguchi's method which is both quick and easy to perform. One
   hundred forty four patients were prospectively compared using Taguchi (n
   = 44) or the modified Lich-Gregoir (n = 100) for anastomotic time, which
   differed significantly (10.2 minutes for Taguchi, vs. 24.6 minutes to
   Lich-Gregoir; P < .005). Minor complications, however, were less among
   Lich-Gregoir patients (P < .02). We concluded to continue using the
   modified Lich-Gregoir ureteroneocystostomy despite taking longer time to
   perform.}},

Abstract = {{Melatonin is an indolamine, mainly secreted by the pineal gland into the
   blood of mammalian species. The potential for protective effects of
   melatonin on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury in
   rats was investigated in this work. CCl4 exerts its toxic effects by
   generation of free radicals; it was intragastrically administered to
   male Wistar rats (4 g kg(-1) body weight) at 20 h before the animals
   were decapitated. Melatonin (15 mg kg-1 body weight) was administered
   intraperitoneally three times: 30 min before and at 2 and 4 h after CCl4
   injection. Rats injected with CCl4 alone showed significant lipid and
   hydropic dystrophy of the liver, massive necrosis of hepatocytes, marked
   increases in free and conjugated bilirubin levels, elevation of hepatic
   enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) in
   plasma, as well as NO accumulation in liver and in blood. Melatonin
   administered at a pharmacological dose diminished the toxic effects of
   CCl4. Thus it decreased both the structural and functional injury of
   hepatocytes and clearly exerted hepatoprotective effects. Melatonin
   administration also reduced CCl4-induced NO generation. These findings
   suggest that the effect of melatonin on CCl4-induced acute liver injury
   depends on the antioxidant action of melatonin. Copyright (c) 2004 John

Abstract = {{Background and aims: The aim was to determine the toxicity, clinical and
   immune responses to the murine monoclonal anti-carcinoembryonic antigen
   (CEA) antibody, PR1A3, in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.
   Materials and methods: Fifteen patients with advanced colorectal cancer
   received either 0.5-, 1.0- or 5.0-mg doses of PR1A3 mixed with 10\% w/v
   Alum adjuvant (Superfos Biosector, Denmark) intradermally at 4-week
   intervals for 3 months. Patient serum was assessed for anti-idiotypic
   (Ab2), anti-anti-idiotypic (Ab3) and human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA)
   reactivity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation with
   phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), CEA and PR1A3, stimulated IL-2, IL-4 and
   IFN-gamma levels and PR1A3-stimulated IL-2 receptor expression during
   immunotherapy were determined. Comparisons were made with 16 age-matched
   controls without malignant disease. Results: Hyperimmune sera from 12 of
   the 15 patients showed Ab2 reactivity with no detectable Ab3 responses.
   Strong HAMA reactivity was recorded in 7 of the 15 cases with no adverse
   clinical effect. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses developed
   in 12 of the 15 patients. Pre-treatment PBMC proliferation with PHA was
   subnormal in each patient compared with controls, becoming normal (or
   supranormal) in all patients during immunisation (P < 0.001). PBMC
   proliferation with CEA and PR1A3 increased during immunotherapy (P <
   0.001) along with stimulated production of IL-2, IFN-gamma and IL-2
   receptor expression. Progressive disease was observed in 14 of the 15
   patients with minimal toxicity. Conclusion: PR1A3 generated limited
   idiotypic responses but robust DTH reactivity in most patients. In vitro
   PBMC proliferation with mitogens and recall antigens is greatly
   increased during the course of immunisation, with a shift in stimulated
   cytokine profile.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Most pancreatic endocrine neoplasms (PENs) have distinctive endocrine
   growth patterns and uniform nuclear morphology; they are regarded as
   relatively low-grade tumors. Significant nuclear pleomorphism is a
   feature that may raise concerns about aggressive behavior or even
   obscure the endocrine nature of the neoplasm. Eight PENs exhibiting
   marked nuclear pleomorphism (> 20\% of the tumor cells) were identified
   during a review of 136 PEN's (5.9\%) from the pathology files of
   Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The histologic,
   immunohistochemical, ultrastructural (4 cases), and clinical features
   were reviewed. There were 6 males and 2 females ranging from 30 to 69
   years (mean, 55 years). The tumors averaged 5.8 cm (range, 1.5-14 cm).
   Six tumors (75\%) were initially misdiagnosed in 5 cases as
   adenocarcinoma and in one as solid-pseudopapillary tumor; in 2 cases,
   the misdiagnosis was based on fine needle aspiration cytology and in 4
   on histologic examination. The architectural features of the tumors
   resembled those of other PENs, but the nuclei were markedly enlarged,
   irregularly shaped, and hyperchromatic, with frequent bizarre forms.
   Cells with pleomorphic nuclei also generally had abundant cytoplasm,
   sometimes with large perinuclear glassy inclusions. The mitotic rate was
   not elevated compared with other PENs, averaging 1.9 (range, 0-7) per 50
   high power fields. Immnuohistochemical findings were (number
   positive/number stained): chromogranin (8 of 8), synaptophysin (7 of 8),
   progesterone receptor (4 of 7), CD99 (2 of 5), S-100 protein (3 of 7),
   and p53 (0 of 6). Scattered cells expressed peptide hormones in a
   minority of cases. By electron microscopy, abundant dense core granules
   were identified, in some cases embedded within perinuclear arrays of
   intermediate filaments. Six patients underwent curative resection; at
   follow-up 4 were free of disease at 11, 13, 30, 112 months (mean, 42
   months),; developed liver metastases at 77 months and was alive with
   disease at 94 months, and 1 was lost to follow-up. Two patients had
   unresectable tumors and were alive with disease at 10 and 78 months.
   Striking nuclear pleomorphism may occur in otherwise typical PENs and
   commonly causes difficulties in the distinction from adenocarcinoma.
   There does not appear to be prognostic significance to these nuclear
   changes, and the morphologic features of pleomorphic PENs otherwise
   resemble those of their conventional counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the axial distribution of a conservative tracer in the
   upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor was modelled by a
   two-compartment model describing sludge bed and liquid zones. The
   orthogonal collocation algorithm was used for numerical solution of the
   model. The model parameters were estimated using on-line
   fluorescence-based measurements of an inert tracer rhodamine. Rhodamine
   concentrations were simultaneously measured at the bottom, middle and
   top of the sludge bed, as well as in the reactor effluent. The model
   used either a constant or variable axial dispersion coefficient in the
   sludge bed zone. A significantly better agreement between model outputs
   and observed tracer distribution was obtained when the dispersion
   coefficient was proportional to a constant raised to the power of the
   reactor height. In addition, a near linear dependence of the dispersion
   coefficient on the liquid upflow velocity was found. These findings,
   along with high efficiency of the orthogonal collocation algorithm used
   for model solution, enable future development of a comprehensive model,
   which accounts for both hydraulics and biokinetics of the anaerobic
   digestion process. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Computer simulation was performed to determine how reentrant activity
   could occur due to the spatial heterogeneity in refractoriness induced

   decreasing the intracellular ATP concentration, reducing conductance of
   the inward Na+ current and increasing the extracellular K+ concentration
   on the two-dimensional sheet. Operator splitting method was used to
   integrate the models. The vulnerability to reentry was estimated from
   the timings of premature stimuli on the constructed models, which could
   result in unidirectionally propagating action potentials. Two kinds of
   sustained spiral waves and their Pseudo-Electroscardiograms were
   observed in numerical simulation. The results showed that the dispersion
   of refractory period increased with ischemic aggravation, and led to
   augment of the vulnerable window. A permature stimulation within the
   vulnerable window could easily induce spiral reentry. The
   Pseudo-Electrocardiograms of the spiral waves exhibited monomorphic
   tachycardiac waveforms. Thus, the spatial heterogeneity in
   refractoriness could be a substrate for reentrant ventricular
   tachyarrhythmias on the regional ischemic tissue.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a class of power control problems where the system
   link gains are assumed to be time varying and the signal-to-interference
   ratio (SIR) estimates are allowed to be corrupted with bounded noises. A
   simple control algorithm is devised by applying a distributed, fixed
   step approach. It is a feedback algorithm that requires only local
   information. By modifying the distributed, fixed step power control
   algorithm proposed by Sung and Wong, we obtain here a more robust
   version that can handle time varying link gains And measurement noises.
   The convergence property of the new algorithm is established and
   simulation studies were carried out to show that it is effective.}},

Abstract = {{The plastic load-bearing capacity of ductile composites such as metal

   The macroscopic strength of a composite is obtained by combining the

   An interface failure model is proposed to account for the effects of the
   interface on the failure of composites. The static limit analysis with
   the finite-element method is then formulated as a constrained nonlinear
   programming problem, which is solved by the Sequential Quadratic
   Programming (SQP) method. Finally, the macroscopic transverse strength
   of perforated materials, the macroscopic transverse and off-axis
   strength of fiber-reinforced composites are obtained through numerical
   calculation. The computational results are in good agreement with the

Abstract = {{Our previous study showed that rilmenidine, a selective I-1-imidazoline
   receptor agonist, enhanced the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated
   protein kinase (MAPK)(p42/44), via the phosphatidylcholine-specific
   phospholipase C pathway in the pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12). In the
   present study, we tested the hypothesis that enhancement of MAPK
   phosphorylation in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) contributes
   to the hypotensive response elicited by I-1-receptor activation in vivo.
   Systemic rilmenidine (600 mu g/kg i.v.) elicited hypotension and
   bradycardia along with significant elevation in MAPK(p42/44), detected
   by immunohistochemistry, in RVLM neurons. To obtain conclusive evidence
   that the latter response was I-1-receptor-mediated, similar hypotensive
   responses were elicited by intracisternal (i.c.) rilmenidine (25 mu
   g/rat) or the highly selective alpha(2)-agonist
   alpha-methylnorepinephrine (4 mu g/rat). An increase in RVLM
   MAPK(p42/44) occurred only after rilmenidine. Furthermore, pretreatment
   with efaroxan (0.15 mu g/rat i.c.), a selective I-1-imidazoline receptor
   antagonist, or with PD98059 (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone) (5 mu g/rat
   i.c.), a selective extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 inhibitor,
   significantly attenuated the hypotensive response and the elevation in
   RVLM MAPK(p42/44) elicited by i.c. rilmenidine. The findings suggest
   that MAPK phosphorylation in the RVLM contributes to the hypotensive
   response induced by I-1-receptor activation and presents in vivo
   evidence that distinguishes the neuronal responses triggered by the
   I-1-receptor from those triggered by the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor.}},

Abstract = {{Alveolar macrophages (AM) are critical components of lung innate
   immunity and contribute to an effective host response to Pneumocystis
   pneumonia. Recognition of unopsonized Pneumocystis organisms by human AM
   is mediated predominantly via mannose receptors and results in
   phagocytosis, release of reactive oxygen species, and activation of the
   nuclear transcription factor (NF)-kappa B. However, the AM host defense
   genes activated by Pneumocystis have not been defined. In the present
   study, incubation of AM with unopsonized Pneumocystis organisms was not
   associated with release of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, or tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (important cytokines in the host response to
   Pneumocystis) and did not induce IL-1 beta, IL-6, or TNF-alpha mRNA
   transcripts. These findings were not attributed to Pneumocystis-induced
   cytopathic changes, as these same AM released IL-8 and matrix
   metalloproteinase-9 in response to Pneumocystis. NF-kappa B-mediated
   IL-8 release was independent of Pneumocystis phagocytosis. The observed
   response was specific, as IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha release and
   mRNA induction were preserved in response to lipopolysaccharide or
   serum-opsonized Pneumocystis. The absence of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and
   TNF-alpha release in response to Pneumocystis was predominately
   influenced by AM mannose receptors, as blocking mannose receptors or
   targeted mannose receptor small interfering RNA functional gene
   silencing resulted in TNF-alpha release in response to unopsonized
   Pneumocystis organisms. Furthermore, ligation of AM mannose receptors by
   unopsonized Pneumocystis organisms reduced Toll-like receptor 4-mediated
   TNF-alpha release. Taken together, these data suggest that mannose
   receptors on human AM may suppress select proinflammatory cytokine
   release and may serve to regulate the innate inflammatory responses to
   infections challenge in the lungs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to investigate the steady spray characteristics of
   kerosene and diesel fuel containing dissolved methane. The spray pattern
   images were captured using a digital camera at the nozzle exit, and the
   spray droplet sizes were measured using a particle size analyzer (LDSA
   1300A) based on the narrow-angle forward-scattering theory. Six types of
   the straight-hole nozzles with different length/diameter ratios (LID)
   were employed in the study, The concentration of methane in liquid fuel
   was controlled by the dissolving pressure of methane, and the flashing
   phenomenon produced by the separating dissolved methane was utilized to
   improve the atomization of the spray. Meanwhile, the parameters,
   including the spray angle, the Sauter mean diameter, and the discharge
   coefficient were measured, and the droplet size distribution was fitted
   using the Rosin-Rammler distribution function. Furthermore, comparison
   of the spray characteristics between kerosene and diesel fuel with
   dissolved methane was made. The study reveals that, for a given L/D,
   ratio nozzle, there is the corresponding critical value of methane
   concentration. When the methane concentration in liquid fuel is larger
   than the critical value, the liquid fuel atomization is found to
   improve, whereas below the critical value, the atomization would be
   suppressed. Moreover, spray angles of liquid fuel containing dissolved
   methane give smaller values compared to that of pure liquid fuel under
   lower concentration of methane, but it will increase dramatically when
   the concentration is over a certain value. Due to low viscosity, the
   flashing atomization of kerosene can be improved remarkably with the
   dissolved methane in fuel compared to that of diesel fuel containing
   dissolved methane in the case of high methane concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Galvanostatic oxidation of glucose, galactose and ethanol at platinum
   electrodes in 0.5 mol(.)L(-1) aqueous NaOH and accompanying potential
   oscillation behaviors were comparatively studied by the electrochemical
   quartz crystal microbalance(EQCM) method. The EQCM-frequency oscillation
   was synchronously observed for the two saccharide systems during their
   potential oscillations, but it was negligibly small for the ethanol
   system, and the responses of the motional resistance were minor for all
   systems, suggesting that the mass effect governed the EQCM frequency
   responses. Although glucose and galactose are very similar in chemical
   structure and the amplitude for potential or frequency oscillation was
   roughly equivalent for both systems, the wave numbers and periods were
   obviously different from each other, implying that the electrochemical
   oscillation possesses high molecular recognition between the two
   systems. Related oscillation mechanism, the effect of NaOH concentration
   on oscillation, and the electrochemical process of platinum electrode in
   aqueous NaOH were also discussed. It was concluded that the platinum
   oxide formed here was mainly PtO2-3H(2)O(ad), and the potential
   oscillations for the two saccharide systems were accompanied with the
   adsorption/desorption of anions of saccharic acids at high/low

   about six fold as that at Pt electrode. XRD and XPS technologies were
   used to investigate the crystal structure and electron effect. The
   results of electrochemical test and ex-site FT-IR test suggested that
   ethanol decomposition on PtSb favors the reactive intermediate route and
   the CO intermediate has less effect on PtSb than on Pt. Part of the
   dynamic parameters of the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol on Pt

   of starch, the amounts of AM and VP, as well as MBA concentration. It
   was found that these reaction variables affected the swelling ratio of
   the hydrogels and the kinetics parameters of the water sorption process.
   The water transport mechanism in the swelling starch-based hydrogels was
   non-Fickian diffusion.}},

   at moderate intensities such as 10(15) W/cm(2) Such density modulations
   can serve as a Bragg reflector, which results in phase reflection from
   underdense plasmas. Because the deep density modulations are just a
   period of half a wavelength in the plasma,the reflected wave reaches the
   maximum by resonance with a reflectivity up to near 100\% The phase
   reflection can also be observed from the plasma with a linear density
   profile, which can significantly reduce the laser absorption by fusion

Abstract = {{Dissolution behavior of carbide TiC in Ti-60 alloys with bimodal
   microstructure during ageing was investigated. Solution treatment in the
   (alpha + beta) phase field followed by quenching in water resulted in
   the precipitation of TiC carbide particles, most of which distributed in
   the beta transformed grains and seldom at the interface of the primary
   alpha (alpha(p)) and beta transformed grains or in the alpha(p) phase.
   The (alpha + beta) solution-treated specimens were aged in the
   temperature range of 750 to 850 degrees C. For the carbide precipitate
   in the 0 transformed grain, the dissolution of carbide preferentially
   occurs from the beta phase side, leading to the irregular shape of
   carbide particles and the beta phase-poor matrix immediately surrounding
   the carbide. The carbide in the alpha(p) phase dissolves at an uniformly
   slow rate. The mechanisms of carbide dissolution are discussed in terms
   of the peritectoid transformation between the beta phase and carbide,
   the movement of dislocations and the influence of curvature.}},

Abstract = {{In order to display the full metastatic phenotype, the cancer cell must
   acquire the ability to migrate. In breast cancer, we have previously
   shown that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) enhances cell motility
   in the highly metastatic MDA-231BO cell line by activating the type I
   IGF receptor (IGF1R). This motility response requires activation of
   IRS-2 and integrin ligation. In order to identify the key molecules
   downstream of IRS-2, we examined several signaling pathways known to be
   involved in cell motility. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was not activated
   by IGF-I, but IGF-I caused redistribution of FAK away from focal
   adhesion plaques. IGF-I treatment of MDA-231BO cells activated RhoA and
   inhibition of Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibited the IGF-mediated motility
   response. The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38, was also
   activated by IGF-I and inhibition of p38 by SB203580 blocked IGF-I
   induced cell motility. ROCK inhibition with Y-27632 also inhibited p38
   phosphorylation suggesting that p38 lies downstream of ROCK. Both Erk1,2
   and phosphatidyl-3 kinase (PI3K) were required for IGF-I stimulated cell
   motility, but only PI3K appeared to be directly downstream of IGF-I.
   Thus, IGF-I activation of its receptor coordinates multiple signaling
   pathways required for cell motility. Defining the key molecules
   downstream of the type I IGF receptor may provide a basis for optimizing
   therapies directed at this target.}},

Abstract = {{Mouse lines with targeted disruption of the cocaine amphetamine-related
   transcript (CART), melanocortin receptor 3 (MCR3), or melanocortin
   receptor 4 (MCR4) were used to assess the role of each component in
   mediating the anorectic and metabolic effects of leptin, and in
   regulating the partitioning of nutrient energy between fat and protein
   deposition. Leptin was administered over a 3 day period using either
   intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular routes of injection. The
   absence of MCR4 blocked leptin's ability to increase UCP1 mRNA in both
   brown and white adipose tissue, but not its ability to reduce food
   consumption. In contrast, deletion of MCR3 compromised leptin's ability
   to reduce food consumption, but not its ability to reduce fat deposition
   or increase UCP1 expression in adipose tissue. Leptin-dependent effects
   on food consumption and adipocyte gene expression were unaffected by the
   absence of CART. Repeated measures of body composition over time
   indicate that the absence of either MCR3 or MCR4, but not CART,
   increased lipid deposition and produced comparable degrees of adiposity
   in both lines. Moreover, modest increases in fat content of the diet (4
   to 11\%) accentuated fat deposition and produced a rapid and comparable
   10-12\% increase in \% body fat in both genotypes. The results indicate
   that nutrient partitioning, as well as the anorectic and metabolic
   responses to leptin, are dependent on integrated but separable inputs
   from the melanocortin 3 and 4 receptor subtypes.}},

Title = {{Comparison of the effects of clozapine and
   8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) on progressive ratio
   schedule performance: evidence against the involvement of 5-HT1A
   receptors in the behavioural effects of clozapine}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Performance on progressive ratio schedules has been proposed
   as a means of assessing the effects of drugs on the efficacy of
   reinforcers. A mathematical model (Killeen PR (1994) Mathematical
   principles of reinforcement. Behav Brain Sci 17:105-172) affords a basis
   for quantifying the effects of drugs on progressive ratio schedule
   performance. The model postulates a bitonic function relating response
   rate and ratio size. One parameter of the function, a, expresses the
   motivational effect of the reinforcer, whereas another parameter, 6,
   expresses the minimum time needed to execute a response, and is regarded
   as an index of `motor capacity'. Previously we found that the atypical
   antipsychotic clozapine increased a, indicating an increase in
   reinforcer efficacy; a similar effect was observed with the
   5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) receptor agonist
   8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). It has been
   suggested that some of clozapine's behavioural effects are mediated by
   agonistic action at 5-HT1A receptors. Objective: This study was
   conducted to compare the effects of clozapine and 8-OH-DPAT on
   progressive ratio schedule performance. Methods: Rats were trained under
   a time-constrained progressive ratio schedule (50-min sessions). In
   experiment 1, they received acute doses of clozapine (4 mg kg(-1)) and
   8-OH-DPAT (100 mu g kg(-1)), alone and in combination with the 5 -HT1A
   receptor antagonist
   N-{[}2-(4{[}2-methoxyphenyl]-l-piperazinyl)ethyl]-N-2-
   yridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635; 30 Lg kg(-1)). In experiment
   2, the effects of clozapine (2, 4 and 8 mg kg(-1)) and 8-OH-DPAT (25, 50
   and 100 Lg kg(-1)) were compared between intact rats and rats whose
   5-HTergic pathways had been ablated by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine
   (5,7-DHT). Results: In both experiments, clozapine and 8-OH-DPAT
   increased a and delta. In experiment 1, WAY-100635 abolished the effect
   of 8-OH-DPAT on a and delta, but did not alter clozapine's effects on
   these parameters. In experiment 2, the effects of clozapine and
   8-OH-DPAT did not differ between sham-lesioned and 5,7-DHT-lesioned
   rats. Conclusions: The results confirm previous findings on the effects
   of clozapine and 8-OH-DPAT on progressive ratio schedule performance.
   8-OH-DPAT's effects are probably mediated by post-synaptic 5-HT1A
   receptors; clozapine's effects are mediated by a different mechanism,
   which does not appear to involve 5-HT1A receptors and which does not
   depend upon an intact 5-HTergic pathway.}},

   carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) , suspended in an aqueous solution of sodium
   dodecylsulfate (SDS), onto predefined electrodes using alternating
   current dielectrophoresis up to 100 MHz. The successful deposition is
   attributed to the formation of an ionic double layer encapsulating the
   nanotubes by surface adsorption of the SDS molecules. The
   nanotube-micella complex formed has a greater polarization than that of
   the s-SWNTs, which is theoretically shown to be frequency dependent up

Abstract = {{The effects of wheat protein and starch on yellow-alkaline noodles have
   not been fully clarified. Twenty-four hard winter wheats with varying
   protein, hot-water swelling power (SP95), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO)
   activity were milled into long-patent and short-patent flours. Protein,
   SP95, and PPO activity in the 48 flours were 8.2-12.9\%, 16.2-24.1 g/g,
   and 80-157 Delta A(480)/mg of protein/min, respectively. Lightness of
   raw noodles declined with increasing protein and PPO levels but
   yellowness decreased and then increased. Tensile force to break the
   cooked noodles was positively correlated with SP95 and protein.
   Compression (50\%) force of noodles made from flour with high SP95
   approximate to 21 g/g, averaged approximate to 20\% below those made
   from low SP95 approximate to 17 g/g of flour. Compression force was
   measured in the long dimension of a single noodle strand using a
   rectangular probe. The instrumental measurements suggest that alkaline
   noodles made from a single-null partial-waxy wheat with medium SP95
   approximate to 19.9 g/g will have a tender bite and a cohesive texture
   compared with those from a low SP95 wheat with a hard bite and
   fracturable texture. Furthermore, alkaline noodles from a double-null
   partial-waxy wheat with high SP95 will have an extra soft bite unless
   flour protein is above approximate to 12.5\%. Hard-white, dual-purpose
   wheat should have a low level of PPO and, depending on the preferred
   noodle-eating texture, a low to medium SP95 level. Such wheats with
   medium protein levels (11-12\%) are well suited for alkaline noodles
   because of improved color and surface smoothness, whereas the same
   wheats with 12-13\% protein are well suited for bread. Wheats with
   medium SP95 also reduce cooking loss and increase cooked yield.}},

Abstract = {{The available methods for studying C uptake of forest and their problems

   estimate instantaneous carbon assimilation rate of a forest. Namely the
   mean canopy stomatal conductance (g(c)) acquired from accurate
   measurement of sap flux density is integrated with the relationship
   between C-13 discrimination (Delta) and C-j/C-a. (intercellular/ambient
   CO2 concentrations) and with that between A(net) (net photosynthetic
   rate) and g(CO2) (stomatal conductance for CO2) so that a new relation

Abstract = {{Different technologies for making X-ray sensitive active matrix
   flat-panel imagers (AMFPI) are reviewed for applications in digital
   radiography and fluoroscopy. Aspects of imaging performance requiring
   improvement are identified and potential new detector concepts
   addressing these issues are briefly described. The rationale is given
   for the investigation of a new detector concept-an indirect conversion
   FPI with avalanche gain-for low-dose X-ray imaging. This detector
   consists of an amorphous selenium (a-Se) photoconductor optically
   coupled to a structured cesium iodide (CsI) scintillator. Under ail
   electric field E-Se, the a-Se is sensitive to light and converts the
   optical photons emitted from CsI into electronic signal that can be
   stored and read out in the same fashion as in existing AMFPI. When E-Se
   is increased to > 90 V/mu m, avalanche multiplication occurs. The
   avalanche gain ranges between 1-800 depending oil Es, and the thickness
   of the a-Se layer. The avalanche a-Se photoconductor is referred to as
   High-gain Avalanche Rushing amorphous Photoconductor. The feasibility of
   two detector configurations based on avalanche gain, each using a
   different image readout method, are under investigation. Their
   advantages are compared to other AMPFI technologies for digital
   radiography and fluoroscopy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   in the pathogenesis of NPC. Methylation-specific polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) for RASSF1A and TSLC1 and quantitative real-time PCR
   analysis of EBV DNA were performed on matched T, P, and Z tissues (n =
   28) as well as chronic nasopharyngitis tissues (n = 8). Hypermethylated
   RASSF1A was frequently detected in the T (82\%) and P tissues (75\%),

   DNA (copies/mu g DNA) in matched T, P, and Z tissues were 673,000,
   90,000, and 7000. The differences of promoter hypermethylation of
   RASSF1A and EBV viral load among T, P, and Z tissues were statistically
   significant, with more frequent methylation and higher viral load
   detected when tissues examined were nearer to the NPC tissues. Our

Abstract = {{Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted phosphoglycoprotein that has been linked
   to tumor progression and survival in several solid tumors, including
   head and neck cancers. Previous studies showed that OPN expression is
   induced by tumor hypoxia, and its plasma levels can serve as a surrogate
   marker for tumor hypoxia and treatment outcome in head and neck cancer
   patients. In this study, we investigate the transcriptional mechanism by
   which hypoxia enhances OPN expression. We found that OPN is induced in
   head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines and in NIH3T3
   cells by hypoxia at both mRNA and protein levels in a time-dependent
   manner. Actinomycin D chase experiments showed that hypoxic induction of
   OPN was not due to increased mRNA stability. Deletion analyses of the
   mouse OPN promoter regions indicated that a ras-activated enhancer (RAE)
   located at -731 to -712 relative to the transcription start site was
   essential for hypoxia-enhanced OPN transcription. Using electrophoretic
   mobility shift assays with the RAE DNA sequence, we found that hypoxia
   induced sequence-specific DNA-binding complexes. Furthermore, hypoxia
   and ras exposure resulted in an additive induction of OPN protein and
   mRNA levels that appeared to be mediated by the RAE. Induction of OPN
   through the RAE element by hypoxia is mediated by an Akt-kinase signaled
   pathway as decreasing Akt levels with dominant negative constructs
   resulted in inhibition of OPN induction by hypoxia. Taken together,
   these results have identified a new hypoxia responsive transcriptional
   enhancer that is regulated by Akt signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Specific cutaneous infiltrates in patients with leukemia
   generally carry a grim prognosis. However, non-neoplastic skin diseases

   Methods: In a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a
   specific infiltrate developed at the site of a florid herpes simplex
   infection. Clinically, the lesion presented itself as an ulcerated
   tumor.
   Results: Histopathologically, the lesion was characterized by a dense,
   diffuse infiltrate of small hyperchromatic lymphocytes throughout the
   entire dermis. Lymphocytes showed an aberrant CD20(+)/CD43(+)/CD5(+)
   phenotype of neoplastic B cells, and monoclonal rearrangement of

   Conclusions: The cutaneous infiltrate of neoplastic cells seemed to be
   part of a physiologic response to the antigenic stimulus, rather than
   indicating an exacerbation of leukemia.}},

Abstract = {{The use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry
   (MALDI-MS) to acquire spectral profiles has become a common approach to
   detect proteomic biomarkers of disease. MALDI-MS signals may represent
   both intact proteins as well as proteolysis products. Liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis can
   tentatively identify the corresponding proteins Here, we describe the
   application of a data analysis utility called FragMint, which combines
   MALDI-MS spectral data with LC-MS/MS based protein identifications to
   generate candidate protein fragments consistent with both types of data.
   This approach was used to identify protein fragments corresponding to
   spectral signals in MALDI-MS analyses of unfractionated human serum. The
   serum also was analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and bands
   corresponding to the MALDI-MS signal masses were excised and subjected
   to in-gel digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis. Database searches mapped all
   of the identified peptides to abundant blood proteins larger than the
   observed MALDI-MS signals. FragMint identified fragments of these
   proteins that contained the MS/MS identified sequences and were
   consistent with the observed MALDI-MS signals. This approach should be
   generally applicable to identify protein species corresponding to

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal patterns of dorsal root - evoked potentials were studied
   in transverse slices of the rat spinal cord by monitoring optical
   signals from a voltage-sensitive dye with multiple-photodiode optic
   camera. Typically, dorsal root stimulation generated two basic waveforms
   of voltage images: dual-component images consisting of fast, spike-like
   signal followed by a slow signal in the dorsal horn, and small, slow
   signals in the ventral horn. To qualitatively relate the optical signals
   to membrane potentials, whole cell recordings were combined with
   measurements of light absorption in the area around the soma. The slow
   optical signals correlated closely with subthreshold postsynaptic
   potentials in all regions of the cord. The spike-like component was not
   associated with postsynaptic action potentials, suggesting that the fast
   signal was generated by presynaptic action potentials. Firing in a
   single neuron could not be detected optically, implying that local
   voltage images originated from synchronously activated neuronal
   ensembles. Blocking glutamatergic synaptic transmission inhibited
   excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and significantly reduced the
   slow optical signals, indicating that they were mediated by
   glutamatergic synapses. Suppressing glycine- mediated inhibition
   increased the amplitude of both optical signals and EPSPs, while
   blocking GABA A receptor - mediated synapses, increased the amplitude
   and time course of EPSPs and prolonged the duration of voltage images in
   larger areas of the slice. The close correlation between evoked EPSPs
   and their respective local voltage images shows the advantage of the
   high temporal resolution optical system in measuring both the
   spatiotemporal dynamics of segmental network excitation and integrated
   potentials of neuronal ensembles at identified sites.}},

   major components in the axial view along with in the radial view. The
   moderate operation condition of the instrument and analytical wavelength
   lack of interference from elements in the sample matrix was selected,
   the spectral background was automaticly eliminated. The obtained coal
   ashes were dissolved in mixtures of nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid and
   perchloric acid after coal samples were cinerated. The analytical
   results were in good agreement with those provided by national standard
   methods. The detection limit of the instrument is ranged between 0.000
   39-0.10 mu g. center dot mL(-1), the precision of the method is in the
   range of 0.79\%-2.84\%, the average recovery of samples is 92.38\%, the

Abstract = {{Objective: Although young victims of intentional violence are commonly
   cared for in emergency departments, minimal information exists regarding
   the characteristics of these young people. This study fills that
   knowledge gap.
   Methods: The assessment tool was administered on all consenting
   consecutive victims of interpersonal violence. A statistical analysis
   was performed on the data using SPSS to obtain descriptive information,
   frequencies, correlations, and regressions. The setting was the
   emergency department of an inner-city level I pediatric and adult trauma
   center with approximately 43,000 visits per year. Patients, aged 10 to
   24, who were victims of interpersonal violence (excluding child abuse,
   sexual assault, and domestic violence), were interviewed using an
   assessment tool to determine their characteristics. The tool was an
   extensive evaluation questionnaire containing the following constructs:
   background information, stress, coping skills, parental involvement,
   peers, delinquency, peer delinquency, future plans, and expectations.
   The results of this study were compared with national, state, or Chicago
   area data for the same noted problems.
   Results: A total of 188 victims of interpersonal violence were
   interviewed. of those, 82.5\% were male; 65.4\% were African Americans,
   and 31.4\% were Hispanic. The study showed that 46.8\% of the subjects
   admitted to having carried a hidden weapon in the past, and 28.9\% to
   having attacked someone with a weapon. Forty-one percent witnessed
   someone being shot or killed in the past year, many in the last year
   (41.2\%). In terms of home environment, 27.7\% stated they live with
   only their mother, 23.4\% live with both parents. Over half (51.1\%)
   were members of a gang, and 50.8\% had been arrested or detained in the
   past year. Regarding drug abuse, 75.5\% reported using marijuana or
   hashish, 14.4\% used cocaine, and 4.3\% used crack during the past year.
   The study demonstrated that the levels of weapon carrying, fighting, and
   marijuana and cocaine use were higher in relation to the comparative
   data, whereas the level of alcohol use was similar.
   Conclusions: Young persons who are victims of interpersonal violence
   have a high rate of delinquency and drug abuse than nonvictimized youth.
   Physicians caring for these youth need to be cognizant of the special
   psychosocial issues of these victims.}},

Abstract = {{Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) is unique among nucleases in its ability to
   induce double-strand breaks within nucleosome Linker regions, but only
   single-strand nicks within the nucteosome itself. Because of this
   property, MNase can be used to determine whether a DNA fragment of
   interest is within a nucteosomel(1,2). In addition, MNase can be used to
   determine the approximate positions of nucleosomes in a region of DNA,
   if the nucleosomes are consistently positioned. In brief, cell nuclei
   are isolated and Limiting concentrations of MNase are added to the
   nuclei, resulting in cleavage at nucleosome linker regions. The genomic
   DNA is purified and the fragments are separated by agarose get
   electrophoresis; the resulting Ladder of stained bands corresponds in
   size to multiples of the nucteosome core plus the tinker (similar to 200
   base pairs (bp)). To determine whether a DNA fragment of interest is
   within a nucteosome, the genomic DNA is subjected to Southern blot
   analysis. If a probe derived from the DNA fragment hybridizes to the
   Ladder of nucleosomal bands, the fragment may indeed be assembled into
   nucleosomes. To determine nucteosome positioning, the purified genomic
   DNA must be cleaved with a restriction enzyme before get electrophoresis
   and Southern blot analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we discuss the prospects of real-time, in situ
   laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy applied for the identification and
   classification of bio-aerosols (including species of potential
   bio-hazard) within common urban aerosol mixtures. In particular, we
   address the issues associated with the picking out of bio-aerosols
   against common background aerosol particles, comparing laser-induced
   breakdown spectroscopy measurements with data from a mobile
   single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (ATOFMS). The data from the
   latter provide statistical data over an extended period of time,
   highlighting the variation of the background composition. While
   single-particle bio-aerosols are detectable in principle, potential
   problems with small (similar to 1 mu m size) bio-aerosols have been
   identified; constituents of the air mass other than background aerosols,
   e.g. gaseous CO2 in conjunction with common background aerosols, may
   prevent unique recognition of the bio-particles. We discuss whether it
   is likely that laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy on its own can
   provide reliable, real-time identification of bio-aerosol in an urban
   environment, and it is suggested that more than one technique should be
   or would have to be used. A case for using a combination of
   laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and Raman (and/or) laser-induced
   fluorescence spectroscopy is made. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To correlate flat titanium film surface properties with deposition
   parameters, titanium flat thin films were systematically deposited on
   glass substrates with various thicknesses and evaporation rates by
   electron-beam evaporation. The chemical compositions, crystal structure,
   surface topographies as well as wettability were investigated by using
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) and water contact angle measurement,
   respectively. The films consisted mainly of TiO2, Small percentages of
   Ti2O3 and metallic Ti were also found at the film surface using
   high-resolution XPS analysis. Quantitative XPS showed little differences
   regarding elemental compositions among different groups of films. The
   films were obtained by varying the deposition rate and the film
   thickness, respectively. XRD data showed consistent reflection patterns
   of the different titanium samples deposited using different film
   thicknesses. Without exception measurements of all samples exhibited
   contact angles of 80 degrees +/- 5 degrees. Quantitative AFM
   characterization demonstrated good correlation tendency between surface
   roughness and film thickness or evaporation rate, respectively. It is
   important to notice that titanium films with different sizes of grains
   on their surfaces but having the same chemistry and film bulk structure
   can be obtained in a controllable way. By increasing the film thickness
   and evaporation rate, the surface roughness increased. The surface
   morphology and grain size growth displayed a corresponding trend.
   Therefore, the control of these parameters allows us to prepare titanium
   films with desired surface properties in a controllable and reproducible
   way for further biological investigations of these materials. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Autonomous intelligent agents often must complete non-Markovian

   order to improve the convergence of evolution and reduce the computation

   (EMPGA), where subpopulations apply different evolutionary strategies.
   In addition, subpopulations compete and cooperate among each other.
   Results show that EMPGA outperformed single population genetic algorithm
   (SPGA) by efficiently distributing the number of individuals among
   subpopulations as different strategies became successful during the
   course of evolution. In addition, the comparison with other
   multi-population GA shows that competition between subpopulations
   improved the quality of solution. The evolved neural controllers were

Abstract = {{This work contributes to the development of an enrichment process for

   Specifically we measured the high-pressure solubility (y(2), molar
   fraction) of a selected bioactive compound in boldo leaves (boldine) in
   CO, as a function of system temperature (298 K <= T <= 333 K) and
   pressure (8 MPa <= P <= 40 MPa). Experimental data was correlated by
   using a density-based model which is valid for solvent densities > 607
   kg/m(3). Predicted solubility values are low (4 x 10(-7) <= y(2) <= 6 x

Abstract = {{Spasticity has been defined as a motor disorder characterized by a
   velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflex (muscle tone).
   Muscle tone consists of mechanical-elastic characteristics, reflex
   muscle contraction and other elements. The aims of this study were to
   determine whether to assess,pasticity quantitatively, and to
   characterize biomechanical and electromyographic spasticity assessment
   parameters. These assessment parameters were described by investigating
   the correlation between clinical measures and;he response to passive
   sinusoidal movement with consecutive velocity increments. Twenty
   post-stroke hemiplegic patients and twenty normal healthy volunteers
   were included in the study. Five consecutive sinusoidal passive
   movements of the ankle were performed at specific velocities (60, 120,
   180, and 240 degrees/sec). We recorded the peak torque, work, and
   threshold angle using a computerized isokinetic dynamometer, and
   simultaneously measured the rectified integrated electromyographic
   activity. We compared these parameters both between groups and between
   different velocities. The peak torque, threshold angle, work, and
   rectified integrated electromyographic activity were significantly
   higher in the post-stroke spastic group at all angular velocities than
   in the normal control group. The threshold angle and integrated
   electromyographic activity increased significantly and linearly as
   angular velocity increased, but the peak torque and work were not
   increased in the post-stroke spastic group. Peak torque, work, and
   threshold angle were significantly correlated to the Modified Ashworth
   scale, but the integrated electromyographic activity was not. The
   biomechanical and electromyographic approach may be useful to
   quantitatively assess spasticity. However, it may also be very important
   to consider the different characteristics of each biomechanical
   parameter.}},

Abstract = {{The principal challenge that the synthesis of oligosaccharides of
   biological importance presents is the development of a general approach
   for the stereoselective introduction of a glycosidic linkage. It is
   shown here that a (1S)-phenyl-2-(phenylsulfanyl)ethyl moiety at C-2 of a
   glycosyl donor can perform neighboring group participation to give a
   quasi-stable anomeric sulfonium ion. Due to steric and electronic
   factors, the sulfonium ion is formed as a traps-decalin ring system.
   Displacement of the sulfonium ion by a hydroxyl leads to the
   stereoselective formation of alpha-glycosides. NMR experiments were
   employed to show convincingly the presence of the beta-linked sulfonium
   ion intermediate. The (1 S)-phenyl-2-(phenylsulfanyl)ethyl moiety could
   be introduced by reaction of a sugar alcohol with acetic acid (1
   S)-phenyl-2(phenylsulfanyl)ethyl ester in the presence of BF3-OEt2.
   Furthermore, it could be removed by conversion into acetate by treatment
   with BF3-OEt2 in acetic anhydride. The introduction as well as the
   cleavage reaction proceeds through the formation of an intermediate
   episulfonium ion. The use of the new methodology in combination with
   traditional neighboring group participation by esters to introduce
   beta-glycosides makes it possible, for the first time, to synthesize a
   wide variety of oligosaccharides by routine procedures. The latter was
   demonstrated by the synthesis of the Galili trisaccharide, which has
   been identified as an epitope that can trigger acute rejections in
   xeno-transplantations, by the one-pot two-step glycosylation sequence.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified theoretical model of storm runoff has been combined with
   analysis of rainfall records to improve understanding of dryland runoff
   processes in the Guadalentin catchment of SE Spain, and in particular
   the decrease in runoff fraction with increasing slope length or
   catchment area.
   Estimates of storm runoff volumes can be made using a simple runoff
   threshold, SCS Curve Numbers, or infiltration equations. A modified
   Green-Ampt equation is applied here to give storm runoff estimates for
   conditions of constant effective rainfall intensity. This can be seen as
   both an improvement on estimates made using the simple runoff threshold,
   although with no additional parameters, and a good approximation to the
   SCS Curve Number family of rainfall-runoff relationships, providing an
   improved theoretical basis for the Curve Number approach and an explicit
   means of linking it to existing soils data on infiltration and surface
   properties. The frequency distribution of intensities is examined to
   determine an appropriate effective intensity in relation to slope
   length, with a duration long enough to allow overland flow to reach the
   slope base. Hydrologically Similar Surfaces (HYSS) are defined by local
   runoff characteristics, and the linkage to infiltration allows an
   explicit comparison with routing over land areas of different area,
   shape and topography. This provides the basis for up-scaling from
   at-a-point runoff to runoff from larger areas which are mapped as
   belonging to the same HYSS class, explicitly allowing for their
   different topography and size, providing an essential step in up-scaling
   data on fine-scale surface characteristics to the response of catchment
   areas. Here we focus on the ways in which catchment area or slope length
   influence runoff production within a given HYSS class.
   Characteristics which drive catchment response include (1) variations in
   intensity over time through a storm (2) areal variations in storm
   volume. For measured rainfall in the upper Guadalentin catchment, SE
   Spain, the first of these factors is seen to be the most important for
   catchments of up to 500 km(2), and a procedure is suggested for deriving
   effective rainfalls from recorded intensity data. The rainfall data can
   then be combined with a HYSS analysis of the soil/land use response, and
   analyses of catchment network morphology and connectivity to forecast
   the heterogeneous distribution of ephemeral stream runoff. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{In this work, multivariate statistical analysis (MVA) techniques are
   coupled with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to identify
   preservative types (chromated copper arsenate, ammoniacal copper zinc or
   alkaline copper quat), and to predict elemental content in
   preservative-treated wood. The elemental composition of the samples was
   measured with a standard laboratory method of digestion followed by
   atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis. The elemental composition was
   then correlated with the LIBS spectra using projection to latent
   structures (PLS) models. The correlations for the different elements
   introduced by different treatments were very strong, with the
   correlation coefficients generally above 0.9. Additionally, principal
   component analysis (PCA) was used to differentiate the samples treated
   with different preservative formulations. The research has focused not
   only on demonstrating the application of LIBS as a tool for use in the
   forest products industry, but also considered sampling errors, limits of
   detection, reproducibility, and accuracy of measurements as they relate
   to multivariate analysis of this complex wood substrate. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Nitrite reductase (NiR) is a multicopper protein, with a trimeric
   structure containing two types of copper site: type I is present in each
   subunit whereas type 2 is localized at the subunits interface. The paper
   reports on the thermal behaviour of wild type NiR from Alcaligenes
   faecalis S-6. The temperature-induced changes of the copper centres are
   characterized by optical spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic
   resonance spectroscopy, and by establishing the thermal stability by
   differential scanning calorimetry. The calorimetric profile of the
   enzyme shows a single endothermic peak with maximum heat absorption at
   T-m approximate to 100 degrees C, revealing an exceptional thermal
   stability. The thermal transition is irreversible and the scan rate
   dependence of the calorimetric trace indicates that the denaturation of
   NiR is kinetically controlled. The divergence of the activation energy
   values determined by different methods is used as a criterion for the
   inapplicability of the one-step irreversible model. The best fit of the
   DSC profiles is obtained when the classical Lumry-Eyring model, N double
   left right arrow U double right arrow F, is considered. The simulation
   results indicate that the irreversible step prevails on the reversible
   one. Moreover, it is found that the conformational changes within the
   type-1 copper environments precede the denaturation of the whole
   protein. No evidence of protein dissociation within the temperature
   range investigated was observed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {{Methyl gallate (meGAL) is known as one of major antioxidants. To
   investigate whether meGAL protects human cells from oxidative stress,
   meGAL extracted from Korean medicinal plant, Cercis chinensis leaves,
   was primarily screened using cell viability assay against oxidative
   stress. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated
   with three different concentrations of meGAL for indicated time. After
   or during meGAL treatment, H(2)O(2)was, added and incubated. meGAL
   showed free radical scavenging effect at low concentration (0.02 mM) and
   cell protective effect against H2O2-mediated oxidative stress. meGAL
   recovered viability of HUVECs damaged by H2O2-treatment, reduced the
   lipid peroxidation (LPO) and decreased the internal reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) level elevated by H2O2-treatment. Free radical scavenging
   effect of meGAL was proven to be very high. Differential display reverse
   transcription-PCR analysis showed that meGAL upregulated the levels of
   regulator of chromatin condensation 1, type 1 sigma receptor and
   phosphate carrier protein expressions, respectively. Based on structural
   similarity compared with meGAL, 14 chemicals were chosen and viability
   assay was performed. Four chemicals, haematommic acid (56.2\%
   enhancement of viability), gallic acid (35.0\%), methylorsellinic acid
   (23.7\%), and syringic acid (20.8\%), enhanced more potent cell
   viability than meGAL, which showed only 18.1 \% enhancement of cell
   viability. These results suggest that meGAL and four meGAL-related
   chemicals protect HUVECs from oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{Both eyes of flatfishes are located on one side of the body due to
   asymmetrical eye migration. The molecular mechanisms underlying such
   asymmetry is poorly understood. As an initial step, we have adopted
   suppression subtractive hybridization for the identification of
   upregulated genes during metamorphosis involving eye migration in
   Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olicaceus. One of the upregulated genes
   was identified as the splicing factor arginine/serine rich-3 (SFRS3).
   Sequence analysis of SFRS3 revealed that it encodes a protein of 168
   amino acids containing the typical eukaryotic RNA recognition motif
   (RRM) and an arginine/serine-rich region. The overall amino acid
   sequences of the Japanese flounder SFRS3 was highly conserved with that
   of other organisms. The expression of flounder SFRS3 gene increased
   sharply from the beginning of metamorphosis and reached a high level of
   expression at stage H of metamorphosis 43 days after hatching. The SFRS3
   gene upregulation was mainly limited to the head region, particularly in
   the rapidly proliferative tissues, the lateral ethmoid and ``skin
   thickness{''} on blind side, which are thought as two proliferative
   tissues to push the eye movement. In spite of the upregulated expression
   of SFRS3 during metamorphosis, its role in metamorphosis involving eye
   migration requires further studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background - We have previously demonstrated that ramipril reduces
   vascular events and new diagnoses of diabetes when given for a 4.5- year
   period. However, it is not known whether the benefits are observed in
   subgroups of patients at varying risk or on other proven therapies and
   whether the benefits are sustained beyond the current trial. The 2 aims
   of this investigation were to assess whether the benefits observed
   during the HOPE trial were ( 1) maintained after trial cessation during
   an additional 2.6 years of follow- up and ( 2) observed in subgroups
   based on risk and ancillary treatments.
   Methods and Results - Of the initial 267 study centers and 9297
   patients, 174 centers and 4528 patients agreed to further follow- up.
   The rates of use of angiotensin- converting- enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs)
   in the 2 groups ( 72\% ramipril versus 68\% placebo) were similar after
   the end of the trial. During the posttrial follow- up, patients
   allocated to ramipril had a 19\% further lower relative risk ( RR) of
   myocardial infarction ( 95\% confidence interval {[} CI], 0.65 to 1.01),
   a 16\% lower RR ( 95\% CI, 0.70 to 0.99) of revascularization, and a
   34\% lower RR of a new diagnosis of diabetes ( 95\% CI, 0.46 to 0.95).
   Similar RR reductions in vascular events were observed during and after
   the active phase of the trial, regardless of baseline risk ( RR of 0.76,
   0.89, and 0.83 for low-, medium-, and high- risk patients, respectively)
   or ancillary treatments ( RR of 0.90 for aspirin, 0.76 for beta-
   blockers, and 0.84 for lipid- lowering medication).
   Conclusions - The benefits of ramipril observed during the active period
   of the HOPE trial were maintained during posttrial follow- up for
   cardiovascular death, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure.
   Additional reductions in myocardial infarction, revascularization, and
   the development of diabetes were observed during the follow- up phase
   despite similar rates of ACEI use in the 2 randomized groups. These
   benefits were consistent regardless of patient risk or ancillary
   treatments.}},

Abstract = {{We show that atypical PKC iota, which plays a critical role in the
   establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity, is
   genomically amplified and overexpressed in serous epithelial ovarian
   cancers. Furthermore, PKC iota protein is markedly increased or
   mislocalized in all serous ovarian cancers. An increased PKC iota DNA
   copy number is associated with decreased progression-free survival in
   serous epithelial ovarian cancers. In a Drosophila in vivo epithelial
   tissue model, overexpression of persistently active atypical PKC results
   in defects in apical-basal polarity, increased Cyclin E protein
   expression, and increased proliferation. Similar to the Drosophila
   model, increased PKC iota proteins levels are associated with increased
   Cyclin E protein expression and proliferation in ovarian cancers. In
   nonserous ovarian cancers, increased PKC iota protein levels,
   particularly in the presence of Cyclin E, are associated with markedly
   decreased overall survival. These results implicate PKC iota as a
   potential oncogene in ovarian cancer regulating epithelial cell polarity
   and proliferation and suggest that PKC iota is a novel target for
   therapy.}},

Abstract = {{An optical technique based on the reflectivity measurements of a thin
   film was used to experimentally study the spreading, evaporation,
   contact line motion, and thin film characteristics of drops consisting
   of a water-surfactant (polyalkyleneoxide-modified
   heptamethyltrisiloxane, called superspreader) solution on a fused silica
   surface. On the basis of the experimental observations, we concluded
   that the surfactant adsorbs primarily at the solid-liquid and
   liquid-vapor interfaces near the contact line region. At equilibrium,
   the completely wetting corner meniscus was associated with a flat
   adsorbed film having a thickness of similar to 31 nm. The calculated
   Hamaker constant, A = -4.47 x 10(-20) J, shows that this thin film was
   stable under equilibrium conditions. During a subsequent
   evaporation/condensation phase-change process, the thin film of the
   surfactant solution was unstable, and it broke into microdrops having a
   finite contact angle. The thickness of the adsorbed film associated with
   the drops was lower than that of the equilibrium meniscus. The drop
   profiles were experimentally measured and analyzed during the
   phase-change process as the contact line advanced and receded. The
   apparent contact angle, the maximum concave curvature near the contact
   line region, and the convex curvature of the drop increased as the drop
   grew during condensation, whereas these quantities decreased during
   evaporation. The position of the maximum concave curvature of the drop
   moved toward the center of the drop during condensation, whereas it
   moved away from the center during evaporation. The contact line velocity
   was correlated to the observed experimental results and was compared
   with the results of the drops of a pure alcohol. The experimentally
   obtained thickness profiles, contact angle profiles, and curvature
   profiles of the drops explain how the surfactant adsorption affects the
   contact line motion. We found that there was an abrupt change in the
   velocity of the contact line when the adsorbed film of the surfactant
   solution was just hydrated or desiccated during the phase-change
   processes. This result shows the effect of vesicles and aggregates of
   the surfactant on the shape evolution of the drops. For these
   surfactant-laden water drops, we found that the apparent contact angle
   increased during condensation and decreased during evaporation. However,
   for the drop of a pure liquid (n-butanol and 2-propanol) the apparent
   contact angle remained constant at a constant velocity during
   condensation and evaporation. The contact line was pinned during the
   evaporation and spreading of the surfactant-laden water drops, but it
   was not pinned for a drop of a pure alcohol (self-similar shape
   evolution).}},

Title = {{A stream tracer technique employing ionic tracers and specific
   conductance data applied to the Maimai catchment, New Zealand}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2005}},

Pages = {{2491-2506}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{The stream tracer technique and transient storage models (TSMs) have
   become common tools in stream solute and hyporheic exchange studies. The
   expense and logistics associated with water sample collection and
   analysis often results in limited temporal resolution of stream tracer
   breakthrough curves (BTCs). Samples are often collected without a priori
   or real-time knowledge of BTC information, which can result in poor
   sample coverage of the critical shoulder (initial rise) and tail
   (post-steady state fall) of the BTC. We illustrate the use of specific
   conductance (SC) measurements as a surrogate for conservative dissolved
   tracer (Br-) samples. The advantages of collecting SC data for use in
   the TSM are (1) cost, (2) ease of data collection, and (3) well-defined
   breakthrough curves, which strengthen TSM parameter optimization. This
   method is based on developing an ion concentration (IC)-SC relationship
   from limited discrete tracer solute samples. SC data can be collected on
   a more frequent basis at no additional analysis cost. TSM simulations
   can then be run for the conservative tracer data derived from SC
   breakthrough curves and the IC-SC relationship. This technique was
   tested in a 120 m reach of stream (2-60 m subreaches) in the Maimai M15
   catchment, New Zealand during baseflow recession. Dissolved LiBr was
   injected for 12-92 h, with Br- as the conservative ion of interest. Four
   TSM simulations using the OTIS model are optimized using UCODE to fit
   (1) Br- data derived from the Br--SC relationship (n = 1307 observations
   at each of two stream sampling sites), (2) all stream Br- data collected
   (n = 58 in upper reach, n = 60 in lower reach), (3) half of the stream
   Br- data collected, and (4) 20 stream Br- samples from each site. No two
   simulations resulted in the same optimal parameter values. Results
   suggest that the greater the frequency of observations, the greater the
   confidence in estimated parameter values. Br- -SC simulations resulted
   in the best overall model fits to the data, with the lowest calculated
   error variance of 6-37, narrowest 95\% parameter estimate confidence
   intervals, and the highest correlation coefficient of 0-99 942, among
   the four simulations. This is largely due to the improved representation
   of the shoulder and tail of the BTC with this method. The IC-SC
   correlation method is robust in situations in which (1) changes in
   background SC data can be accounted for, and (2) the data used to define
   the IC-SC relationship are representative of the range of data
   collected. This method provides more efficient sample analysis, improved
   data resolution, and improved model results compared to the alternative
   stream tracer data gathering methods presented. Additionally, we
   describe a new parameterization of the cross-sectional area of the
   stream during flow recession, as a function of discharge, based on a
   stream hydraulic geometry relationship. This variant of the OTIS model
   provides a more realistic representation of stream dynamics during
   unsteady discharge. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the change of the intercalated amount and
   conformational behavior of dodecyldiamine (C12H28N2, di-C(12)amine)
   inside the confined space of the montmorillonite (MMT) intergallery at
   different pHs of the intercalation solution
   (H2O/ethanol/Na+-MMT/di-C(12)amine), and these results were compared
   with those of dodecylmonoamine (C12H27N, mono-C(12)amine). The
   mono-C12amine with one end-functional amine (-NH2) has a constant
   intercalated amount independent of the pH of the intercalation solution,
   confirming the tail conformation in the MMT intergallery. On the other
   hand, the intercalated amount of di-C(12)amines remains quite low at low
   pH due to the long-range Coulombic repulsion among protonated amines.
   The di-C12amines dominantly take the bridge conformation inside the MMT
   intergallery up to pH 9.5 and adopt a fraction of the tail conformation
   at pH 11.5, which is verified by Fourier transform infrared spectra with
   an abrupt frequency shift of the CH2 stretching band and the emergence
   of a new NH2 scissoring band at 1598 cm(-1) related to unanchored free
   amines. The d-spacing and the square of the half-width at half-maximum
   of the MMT based on X-ray diffraction measurements are also constant up
   to pH 9.5, while these two variables are suddenly increased at pH 11.5.
   The bridge conformation of di-C(12)amines in the confined space of the
   MMT intergallery prevents poly(ethylene oxide) chains from intercalation
   into the MMT intergallery, called the gluing effect.}},

Abstract = {{A bronze coin datable of the post-Roman empire and discovered in Morocco
   was studied. The in-depth structure and the composition of both patina
   and substrate alloy were determined by SEM observations, EDS (elemental
   dispersion analysis using X-ray) cartographies and Raman spectroscopy on
   a cross-section. The composition of the patina and that of the substrate
   alloy were found to be highly heterogeneous. Some patina particles were
   also scraped off from coin surface. Their electrochemical properties
   were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy with a cavity microelectrode. Cyclic voltammetry revealed
   the presence of three cathodic current peaks. In situ Raman
   microspectroscopy on the microelectrode allowed the attribution of two
   of them to Cu(0)\textbackslash{}Cu(I) and Cu(I)\textbackslash{}Cu(II).
   The third one was ascribed to the presence of lead oxide. Moreover, it
   was observed that tin dioxide initially present in the patina gradually
   disappeared independently of the potential cycling. This phenomenon was
   explained by the dissolution of this species through a chemical process.
   The impedance spectra collected with the cavity microelectrode were
   simulated suitably with an oxidation-reduction reaction coupled with a
   hemispherical diffusion model of dissolved oxygen. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Phytate (inositol hexalkisphosphate, IN is a regulator of intracellular
   signaling, a highly abundant animal antinutrient, and a phosphate store
   in plant seeds. Here, we report a requirement for inositol polyphosphate
   kinases, AtIPK1 and AtIPK2 beta, for the later steps of phytate
   synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Coincident disruption of these
   kinases nearly ablates seed phytate without accumulation of phytate
   precursors, increases seed-free phosphate by 10-fold, and has normal
   seed yield. Additionally, we find a requirement for inositol
   tetrakisphosphate (IP4)/inositol pentakisphosphate ON 2-kinase activity
   in phosphate sensing and root hair elongation. Our results define a
   commercially viable strategy for the genetic engineering of phytate-free
   grain and provide insights into the role of inositol polyphosphate
   kinases in phosphate signaling biology.}},

Abstract = {{Background-A ``saddle-shaped{''} mitral annulus with an optimal ratio
   between annular height and commissural diameter may reduce leaflet and
   chordal stress and is purported to be conserved across mammalian
   species. Whether annuloplasty rings maintain this relationship is
   unknown.
   Methods and Results-Twenty-three adult sheep underwent implantation of
   radiopaque markers on the left ventricle and mitral annulus. Eight
   animals underwent implantation of a Carpentier-Edwards Physio ring, 7
   underwent a Medtronic Duran flexible ring, and 8 served as controls.
   Animals were studied with biplane videofluoroscopy 7 to 10 days
   postoperatively. Annular height and commissural width (CW) were
   determined from 3D marker coordinates, and annular height:CW ratio
   (AHWCR) was calculated. Annular height was similar in Control and Duran
   animals but significantly lower in the Physio group at end diastole (8.4
   +/- 3.8, 6.7 +/- 2.3, and 3.4 +/- 0.6 mm, respectively, for Control,
   Duran, and Physio; ANOVA=0.005) and at end systole (14.5 +/- 6.2, 10.5
   +/- 5.5, and 5.8 +/- 2.5 mm, respectively, for Control, Duran, and
   Physio; ANOVA=0.004). Both ring groups reduced CW significantly relative
   to Control. AHCWR did not differ between Control and Duran but was lower
   in Physio (23 +/- 11\%, 24 +/- 7\%, and 12 +/- 2\% at end diastole and
   42 +/- 17\%, 37 +/- 17\%, and 21 +/- 10\% at end systole, respectively,
   for Control, Duran, and Physio, respectively; ANOVA <0.05 for both).
   Conclusions-Mitral annular height and AHWCR of the native valve were
   unchanged by a Duran ring, whereas the Physio ring led to a lower AHWCR.
   Theoretically, such a flexible annuloplasty ring may provide better
   leaflet stress distribution by maintaining normal AHWCR.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have investigated grey matter reductions in first
   episode schizophrenia (FES), but few have examined the relationship
   between grey matter reduction and clinical profile. A group of 31
   patients with strictly defined FES and 30 healthy controls underwent
   T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Voxel-based
   morphometry in SPM99 was used to identify four distinct regions of grey
   matter reduction in the FES subjects. The regions of interest (ROIs)
   were in the left ventral prefrontal cortex (ROI 1), left parietal and
   temporal cortices (ROI 2), right cerebellum (ROI 3), and right frontal
   and parietal cortices (ROI 4). These regions of reduction were
   transformed into binary masks, which were convolved with patients'
   preprocessed grey matter images. Patients' grey matter volumes in these
   regions were correlated with their composite scores on the following
   three symptom dimensions: Psychomotor Poverty, Disorganization and
   Reality Distortion. The volumes of ROls 1, 2 and 4 were found to be
   significantly correlated with the Reality Distortion syndrome score. Our
   findings indicate that distinct, widespread grey matter reductions are
   present very early in the course of schizophrenia. The results also
   suggest a possible structural underpinning for the abnormal brain
   activity typically associated with symptoms of Reality Distortion. (c)

Abstract = {{The N = 8, 1D analytic bi-harmonic superspace is shown to provide a
   natural setting for N = 8 supersymmetric mechanics associated with the
   off-shell multiplet (4, 8, 4). The latter is described by an analytic
   superfield q(1,1), and we construct the general superfield and component
   actions for any number of such multiplets. The set of transformations
   preserving the flat superspace constraints on q(1,1) constitutes Ar = 8
   extension of the two-dimensional Heisenberg algebra h(2), with an
   operator central charge. The corresponding invariant q(1,1) action is
   constructed. It is unique and breaks I D scale invariance. We also find
   a one-parameter family of scale-invariant q(1,1) actions which, however,
   are not invariant under the full Ar = 8 Heisenberg supergroup. Based on
   preserving the bi-harmonic Grassmann analyticity, we formulate N = 8, 1D
   supergravity in terms of the appropriate analytic supervielbeins. For
   its truncated version we construct, both at the superfield and component
   levels, the first example of off-shell q(1,1) action with local Ar = 8,
   ID supersymmetry. This construction can be generalized to any number of
   self-interacting q(1,1). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{ZnO crystals were implanted with N+, O+, and Al+, and co-implanted with
   O+/N+ and Al+/N+ ions. Positron annihilation measurements indicate
   introduction of vacancy clusters upon implantation. In the N+-implanted

   partially annealed at 800 degrees C, as compared with their entire

   suggesting a strong interaction between nitrogen and vacancy clusters.
   However, in the O+/N+ co-implanted sample, most vacancy clusters
   disappear at 800 degrees C. Probably oxygen scavenges nitrogen to
   enhance the annealing of the vacancy clusters. Upon further annealing at
   1000-1100 degrees C, nitrogen also forms stable complexes with thermally
   generated vacancies. These nitrogen-related vacancy complexes need
   high-temperature annealing at 1200-1250 degrees C to be fully removed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper described an efficient synthetic strategy for chiral acyclic
   nucleoside analogues containing both the phenoxy components of some
   bioactive natural compounds and a heterocyclic base. The phenoxy
   components with adenine moiety were incorporated into the chiral acyclic
   nucleoside analogues through two key synthetic tactics. Chiron
   5-(R)-menthyloxy-2(5H)-furanone 5 was obtained in good yield from the
   cheap starting material furfural via a valuable synthetic route. The
   asymmetric Michael addition of 5 with adenine and the subsequent
   reduction reaction afforded the key chiral intermediate, 2-(R)-(9
   `-adeninyl)- 1,4-butanediol 8. The absolute conriguration of 8 was
   established by X-ray crystallography. The intermolecular dehydration
   reaction between 2-(9 `-adeninyl)- 1,4-butanediol 8 and phenoxy
   components 9 on treatment with diethyl azodicarboxy late and
   triphenylphosphine was carried out to give the chiral acyclic nucleoside
   analogues 1a-1e. The regioselectivity of the reaction was established by
   NMR methods, especially through C-13 NMR shifts and NOE effect observed
   in the target molecule 1c, as well as by HMBC/HMQC experiments. The
   target compounds were tested for inhibition of cytopathogenicity against
   different cancer cells and exhibited potential anticancer activity. (c)

Abstract = {{Our previous study indicated that interleukin (IL)-1 beta induces
   expression of several Wnt proteins in chondrocytes and causes
   chondrocyte dedifferentiation via the c-Jun/activator protein-1 (AP-1)
   pathway. This study examined whether Wnt-3a causes chondrocyte
   dedifferentiation via the e-Jun/AP-1 pathway. Wnt-3a inhibited
   chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells by stabilizing cell-cell adhesion in
   a manner independent of P-catenin transcriptional activity. Wnt-3a also
   induced dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes by stimulating the
   transcriptional activity of beta-catenin-T
   cell-factor/lymphoid-enhancer-factor (Tcf/Lef) complex. In chondrocytes,
   Wnt-3a caused the expression of c-Jun and its phosphorylation by c-Jun
   N-terminal kinase (JNK), resulting in activation of AP-1. AP-I
   activation suppressed the expression of Sox-9, a major transcription
   factor regulating type 11 collagen expression. Collectively, our results
   suggest that Wnt-3a inhibits chondrogenesis by stabilizing cell-cell
   adhesion and that it causes dedifferentiation of chondrocytes by
   activating of beta-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional complex and the
   c-Jun/AP-1 pathway. (c) 2005 Federation of European Biochemical

Abstract = {{Borrelia burgdorferi contains one 16S rRNA gene and two tandem sets of
   23S and 5S rRNA genes located in a single chromosomal region. This
   unusual rRNA gene organization has been speculated to be involved in the
   slow growth of this organism. Because we were repeatedly unable to
   isolate a 23S ribosomal mutant in B. burgdorferi by allelic exchange, we
   developed a transposition mutagenesis system for this bacterium. To this
   end, Himar1 transposase is expressed in B. burgdorferi from a resident
   plasmid containing an erythromycin resistance marker, and this strain is
   then electroporated with suicide plasmids containing mariner transposons
   and kanamycin resistance genes expressible in B. burgdorferi. This
   system permitted us to generate hundreds of
   erythromycin/kanamycin-resistant B. burgdorferi clones with each of
   three suicide plasmids. DNA sequencing of several kanamycin-resistant
   clones generated with one of the suicide plasmids showed stable and
   random insertion of the transposon into the B. burgdorferi chromosomal
   and plasmid genome. One mutant was inactivated in rrlA (23S rRNA),
   another ftsJ (rrmJ). rrlA disruption had no effect on growth rate under
   a wide range of culture conditions, but disruption of ftsJ interfered
   significantly with growth rate and bacterial morphology. These data show
   it is possible to isolate random and stable B. burgdorferi transposition
   mutants for physiological analysis of this pathogenic spirochete. (c)

Abstract = {{Cadherin-mediated adhesion can be regulated at many levels, as

   the requirements for Drosophila melanogaster epithelial ( DE) cadherin

   system allowed the dissection of DE-cadherin function in several types
   of adhesion: cell sorting, cell positioning, epithelial integrity, and
   the cadherin-dependent process of border cell migration. We generated
   multiple fusions between DE-cadherin and alpha-catenin as well as
   point-mutated beta-catenin and analyzed their ability to support these
   types of adhesion. We found that ( 1) although linking DE- cadherin to
   alpha-catenin is essential, regulation of the link is not required in
   any of these types of adhesion; ( 2) alpha-catenin is required only to
   link DE- cadherin to alpha-catenin; and ( 3) the cytoplasmic domain of
   DE- cadherin has an additional specific function for the invasive
   migration of border cells, which is conserved to other cadherins. The
   nature of this additional function is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cells share several characteristics of cancer cells including loss
   of contact inhibition and immortality. Therefore, stem cells represent
   an excellent model system in which to define the molecular mechanisms
   underlying cancer development and progression. Several signal
   transduction pathways including leukemia inhibitory factor, Wnt and FGF
   have been demonstrated to function in stem cell self-renewal and
   differentiation. However, more recently bone morphogenetic proteins
   (BMPs) have emerged as key regulators of stem cell fate commitment.
   Intriguingly, BMPs have disparate roles in regulating the biology of
   embryonic stem (ES) cells compared with neural crest stem cells (NCSCs).
   Furthermore, although BMPs block neural differentiation of ES cells from
   both mouse and human, they contribute to self-renewal specically in
   mouse ES cells. These observations strongly suggest that combinations of
   extracellular factors regulate stem cells, and that crosstalk between
   intracellular signaling pathways precisely defines stem cell fate
   commitment. In this review, we focus on the role of BMP signaling in
   mouse and human ES cells compared with NCSCs. We then discuss how the
   molecular effectors of BMP signaling may contribute to cancer, and thus
   represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence indicates that cell-cycle regulating proteins are
   involved in apoptotic process in post-mitotic neurons. In this study, we
   examined cell-cycle regulators for G(1)/S cell-cycle progression after a
   transient focal cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery
   (MCA) occlusion. In the cerebral frontoparietal cortex, we observed a
   marked induction of Cyclin D1 (a coactivator of Cdks), and proliferating
   cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), together with upregulated Cdk kinase
   activities. This process is accompanied with multiple phosphorylation of
   retinoblastoma (Rb) protein at Cdk phosphorylation sites in neurons from
   the ischemic cortex. We further examined DNA synthesis by the
   incorporation of BrdU, a nucleotide analog that incorporates into newly
   synthesized DNA. Within 24-h of reperfusion after 60-min occlusion,
   substantial BrdU-positive neurons were observed in the ischemic cortex.
   Inhibition of Cdk4 activity during this ischemia/reperfusion is highly
   neuroprotective. These results suggest that ischemia/reperfusion
   cerebral damage induces signalings at the G1/S cell-cycle transition,
   and may constitute a critical step in the neuronal apoptotic pathway in
   ischemia/reperfusion induced neuronal damage. (c) 2005 Federation of

Abstract = {{The photoabsorption spectra of Te I through to Te IV have been recorded
   in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region using the dual laser plasma
   (DLP) technique. Photoexcitation from the 4d subshell is the dominant
   process in the 50 to 130 eV region. Above the 4d ionization thresholds
   the spectra were found to be dominated by a 4d -> epsilon f shape
   resonance which peaks at 88 eV in each case, indicating that complete 4f
   ``collapse{''} has not occurred in stages up to and including Te3+. A
   transfer of oscillator strength from the resonance to the
   pseudo-discrete 4d -> nf (n >= 4) transitions with increasing ionization
   is evident from Te2+ onwards with the 4d(10)5s(2)5p(2)P3/2 ->
   4d(9)5s(2)5p4f(D-3)(2)D5/2 transition being the strongest feature in the
   Te IV spectrum. Time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA)
   calculations successfully account for the shape resonance while
   Hartree-Fock with configuration interaction calculations permit
   identification of the discrete features.}},

   from ASTRID are available for energies 20-160 eV. R-matrix calculations
   have been carried out and comparison is made with the measured data. In
   the near threshold region (< 25 eV), theory predicts two 3pns P-3(o)
   resonance series, a 3pns P-1(o) and a 3pnd P-1(o) series. The experiment
   detects a single 3pns series and we find excellent agreement with the

Abstract = {{Some phthalates, such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP) and dibutyl

   teratogenic and endocrino-disrupting effects. In this study, urinary
   levels of phthalates ( DEHP, DBP, diethyl phthalate (DEP), butylbenzyl
   phthalate BBP), and monoethylhexyl phthalate ( MEHP, a major metabolite
   of DEHP) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC)
   in human populations ( women {[} hospital visitors], n = 150, and
   children, n = 150). Daily exposure level of DEHP in children was
   estimated to be 12.4 mu g/kg body weight/d ( male 9.9 mu g/kg body
   weight/d, female 17.8 mu g/kg body weight/d), but, in women was
   estimated to be 41.7 mu g/kg body weight/d, which exceeded the tolerable
   daily intake (TDI, 37 mu g/kg body weight/day) level established by the
   European Union (EU) Scientific Committee for Toxicity, Ecotoxicity, and

   data, hazard indices (HIs) were calculated to be 1.12 (41.7/37 TDI) for
   women and 0.33 (12.4/37 TDI) for children, respectively. These data
   suggest that Koreans ( women and children) were exposed to significant
   levels of phthalates, which should be reduced to as low a level as
   technologically feasible to protect Koreans from the exposure to toxic
   phthalates.}},

Abstract = {{Portal vein thrombosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension
   in noncirrhotic patients. Variceal bleeding is difficult to treat in
   these patients, especially those with prehepatic diffuse portal
   mesenteric thrombosis. In a patient with refractory
   esophagogas-troduodenal variceal bleeding as a result of diffuse
   portomesenteric thrombosis and portal hypertension, life-threatening
   bleeding was unresponsive to endoscopic therapy and other surgical
   procedures. A multivisceral transplant was performed. It was curative
   and also lifesaving. There is only one report in the literature
   mentioning multivisceral transplantation for a patient with
   life-threatening esophagogastroduodenal bleeding; however that patient
   had protein C deficiency. Our patient had normal liver and intestinal
   function tests and no signs of hypercoagulable disease. We believe that
   multivisceral transplantation should be considered as a treatment option
   for patients with diffuse mesenteric thrombosis, even in the absence of
   liver and intestinal failure, when other treatment options for variceal
   bleeding have failed, particularly in a younger patient with a
   relatively good nutritional status before transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{In our efforts to develop low cost high-power Li-ion batteries with
   excellent safety, as well as long cycle and calendar life, lithium
   manganese oxide spinet and layered lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide
   cathode materials were investigated. Our studies with the
   graphite/LiPF6/spinel cells indicated a very significant degradation of
   capacity with cycling at 55 degrees C. This degradation was caused by
   the reduction of manganese ions on the graphite surface which resulted
   in a significant increase of the charge-transfer impedance at the
   anode/electrolyte interface. To improve the stability of the spinet, we
   investigatcd an alternative salt that would not generate HF acid that
   may attack the spinet. The alternative salt we selected for this work
   was lithium bisoxalatoborate, LiB(C2O4)(2) ({''}LiBoB{''}). In this
   case, the graphite/LiBoB/spinel Li-ion cells exhibited much improved
   cycle/calendar life at 55 degrees C and better abuse tolerance, as well
   as excellent power. A second system based on LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 layered
   material was also investigated and its performance was compared to
   commercial LiNi(0.8)CO(0.15)A(0.05)O(2). Cells based on
   LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 showed lower power fade and better thermal safety
   than the LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2-based commercial cells under similar test
   conditions. Li-ion cells based on the material with excess lithium
   (Li1.1Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2) exhibited excellent power performance that
   exceeded the FreedomCAR requirements. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Amino acid sequence alignment was used to identify the putative thumb
   subdomain of reverse transcriptase ( RT) from the Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae long terminal repeat-containing retrotransposon Ty3. The
   counterpart to helix alpha H of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (
   HIV-1) RT, which mediates important interactions with a duplex nucleic
   acid similar to 3 - 6 bp behind the DNA polymerase catalytic center, was
   identified between amino acids 290 and 298 of the Ty3 enzyme. The
   consequences of substituting Ty3 RT Gln(290), Phe(292), Gly(294),
   Asn(297), and Tyr(298) ( the counterparts of HIV-1 RT Gln(258),
   Leu(260), Gly(262), Asn(265), and Trp(266), respectively) for both DNA
   polymerase and RNase H activities were examined. DNA-dependent DNA
   synthesis was evaluated on unmodified substrates and on duplexes
   containing targeted insertion of locked nucleic acid analogs and abasic
   lesions in either the template or primer. Based on this combined
   strategy, our data suggest an interaction of Ty3 RT Tyr298 with primer
   nucleotide - 3, Gly294 with primer nucleotide - 4, and Asn297 with
   template nucleotide - 6. Substitution of Ala for Gln290 was well
   tolerated, despite the high degree of conservation at this position.
   Mutations in the thumb subdomain of Ty3 also affected RNase H activity,
   suggesting a closer spatial relationship between its N- and C-terminal
   catalytic centers compared with HIV-1 RT.}},

Abstract = {{The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays an essential role in
   mood regulation and integration of cognitive functions that are abnormal
   in major depressive disorder (MDD). Few neuroimaging studies have
   evaluated the still maturing DLPFC in depressed children and
   adolescents. We conducted single voxel proton magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) of the left DLPFC in 14 depressed children and
   adolescents (13.3 +/- 12.3 years old, 10 males) and 22 matched healthy
   controls (13.6 +/- 2.8 years old, 13 males). Depressed subjects had
   significantly lower levels of glycerophosphocholine plus phosphocholine
   (GPC + PC; or choline-containing compounds) and higher myo-inositol
   levels in the left DLPFC compared to healthy controls. In the depressed
   subjects, we found significant inverse correlations between glutamate
   levels and both duration of illness and number of episodes. In healthy
   controls there was a significant direct correlation between age and
   glutamine levels, which was not present in the patient group. Lower GPC
   + PC levels in pediatric MDD may reflect lower cell membrane content per
   volume in the DLPFC. Increased myo-inositol levels in MDD may represent
   a disturbed secondary messenger system. GPC + PC and myo-inositol
   abnormalities further demonstrate the involvement of DLPFC in pediatric
   MDD. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hydroxamate siderophore receptor FhuA is a TonB-dependent outer
   membrane protein of Escherichia coli composed of a C-terminal
   22-stranded beta-barrel occluded by an N-terminal globular cork domain.
   During siderophore transport into the periplasm, the FhuA cork domain
   has been proposed to undergo conformational changes that allow transport
   through the barrel lumen; alternatively, the cork may be completely
   displaced from the barrel. To probe such changes, site-directed cysteine
   mutants in the cork domain ( L109C and Q112C) and in the barrel domain (
   S356C and M383C) were created within the putative siderophore transport
   pathway. Molecular modeling predicted that the double cysteine mutants
   L109C/S356C and Q112C/M383C would form disulfide bonds, thereby
   tethering the cork and barrel domains. The double cysteine FhuA mutants
   were denatured under nonreducing conditions and fluorescently labeled
   with thiol-specific Oregon Green maleimide. Subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis
   revealed two distinct species: FhuA containing a disulfide bond and FhuA
   with free sulfhydryl groups. To address the role of the putative
   siderophore transport pathway and to evaluate possible rearrangements of
   the cork domain during ferricrocin transport, disulfide bond formation
   was enhanced by an oxidative catalyst. Cells containing double cysteine
   FhuA mutants that were subjected to oxidation during ferricrocin
   transport exhibited disulfide bond formation to near completion. After
   disulfide tethering of the cork to the barrel, ferricrocin transport was
   equivalent to transport by untreated cells. These results demonstrate
   that blocking the putative siderophore transport pathway does not
   abrogate ferricrocin uptake. We propose that, during siderophore
   transport through FhuA, the cork domain remains within the barrel rather
   than being displaced.}},

Abstract = {{Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is increasingly recognized
   as an important cellular process involved in numerous physiological and
   pathophysiological processes. Complex I ( NADH: ubiquinone
   oxidoreductase) is considered as one of the major sources of ROS within
   mitochondria. Yet, the exact site and mechanism of superoxide production
   by this large membrane-bound multiprotein complex has remained
   controversial. Here we show that isolated complex 1 from Yarrowia
   lipolytica forms superoxide at a rate of 0.15\% of the rate measured for
   catalytic turnover. Superoxide production is not inhibited by ubiquinone
   analogous inhibitors. Because mutant complex I lacking a detectable
   iron-sulfur cluster N2 exhibited the same rate of ROS production, this
   terminal redox center could be excluded as a source of electrons. From
   the effect of different ubiquinone derivatives and pH on this side
   reaction of complex I we concluded that oxygen accepts electrons from
   FMNH2 or FMN semiquinone either directly or via more hydrophilic
   ubiquinone derivatives.}},

Abstract = {{Neoproterozoic high-grade metamorphic rocks of the lower to middle crust
   are exposed along parts of the East African Orogen (EAO). However, the
   mechanisms and rates of exhumation of these deep orogenic rocks remain
   unclear. In eastern Eritrea, the rocks of the EAO comprise two
   lithotectonic domains: Ghedem and Bizen. The Ghedem domain consists of
   low-angle mylonites among lower to middle crustal gneisses and schists
   that were metamorphosed at amphibolite facies conditions before being
   retrogressed locally. Here we quantitatively constrain time increments
   in the exhumation history of the low-angle Ghedem mylonites using
   Ar-40/Ar-39-cooling ages for metamorphic homblende and white mica
   samples extracted from them. The hornblende samples gave an average
   plateau age of about 579 6 Ma and the white mica samples an average
   plateau age of about 567 +/- 5 Ma. Geothermobarometry had already shown
   that these rocks experienced progressive syn-deformation metamorphism
   that peaked when P-T conditions were near 12 kbar and 650 degrees C at
   593 +/- 5 Ma. These P-T conditions and the new Ar-40/Ar-39 cooling ages
   indicate that cooling and exhumation of the low-angle mylonites of the
   Ghedem domain were accomplished in three increments of different rate as
   they progressively rose from as deep as 45 km while the orogen was
   collapsing during the late Neoproterozoic. In the first increment, the
   rocks cooled similar to 11 degrees C/Ma as they rose at about 1.07 km/Ma
   to cool through 500 degrees C at a depth of 30 km at 579 5 Ma. In the
   second increment, the rocks cooled about similar to 10 degrees C/Ma
   after their exhumation rate increased to about 1.25 km/Ma so that they
   cooled through 300 degrees C at 567 5 Ma. A third increment, poorly
   constrained by unconformable Permo-Carboniferous sediments, implies
   minimum cooling rates of 1.4 degrees C/Ma and exhumation rates of only
   0.06 km/Ma. The first two increments of exhumation occurred when the EAO
   in eastern Eritrea was undergoing gravitational collapse probablymuch
   faster and later than in the southern EAO. Such regional differences in
   gravitational collapse rates map local differences in maximum
   lithospheric thickness built by the final convergence of East and West
   Gondwana. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A fiber optic strain sensing method based on genetic algorithm (GA) is
   presented in a Mach-Zehnder type fiber interferometer. The interferogram
   recorded from the interferometer has been demodulated using GA and the
   phase data of the pattern has been represented by a suitable grade
   polynomial fitting function. A population set of chromosomes is used to
   codify the coefficients of the polynomial function that estimates the
   phase. The modulation of group delay and dispersion caused by the
   measurand has been obtained from the phase curve where no unwrapping
   process is required. Results for different applied low strains (<= 20 mu
   strain) are presented. The values are compared with those obtained by
   data dependent system (DDS) method and Fourier transform method. (C)

Abstract = {{Although nicotine has been suggested to promote lung carcinogenesis, the
   mechanism of its action in this process remains unknown. The present
   investigation demonstrates that the treatment of rat lung epithelial
   cells with nicotine for various periods differentially mobilizes
   multiple intracellular pathways. Protein kinase C and phosphoinositide
   3-OH-kinase are transiently activated after the treatment. Also, Ras and
   its downstream effector ERK1/2 are activated after long term exposure to
   nicotine. The activation of Ras by nicotine treatment is responsible for
   the subsequent perturbation of the methotrexate ( MTX)-mediated G(1)
   cell cycle restriction as well as an increase in production of reactive
   oxygen species. When p53 expression is suppressed by introducing E6,
   persistent exposure to nicotine enables dihydrofolate reductase gene
   amplification in the presence of methotrexate ( MTX) and the formation
   of the MTX-resistant colonies. Altering the activity of phosphoinositide
   3-OH-kinase has no effect on dihydrofolate reductase amplification.
   However, the suppression of protein kinase C dramatically affects the
   colony formation in soft agar. Thus, our data suggest that persistent
   exposure to nicotine perturbs the G1 checkpoint and causes DNA damage
   through the increase of the production of reactive oxygen species.
   However, a third element rendered by loss of p53 is required for the
   initiation of the process of gene amplification. Under p53-deficient
   conditions, the establishment of a full oncogenic transformation, in
   response to long term nicotine exposure, is achieved through the
   cooperation of multiple signaling pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Ion chromatography of sulfide, sulfite, sulfate and thiosulfate in a
   mixture is often difficult because of instability of sulfide and
   sulfite, poor separation of sulfide from common anions Such as bromide
   or nitrate and similar elution-times for sulfite and sulfate. An
   ion-pair chromatographic method for the determination of these sulfur
   anions has been established by stoichiometric conversion of sulfide and
   sulfite into stable thiocyanate and sulfate, respectively, prior to the
   chromatographic run. Sulfate, thiosulfate and thiocyanate were resolved
   on an octadecylsilica column with an acetonitrile-water mobile phase
   containing tetrapropylammonium salt (TPA) as an ion-paring reagent, and
   thiosulfate and thiocyanate in the effluent could be measured with a
   photometric detector (220 nm) and sulfate with a suppressed conductivity
   detector. When an acetonitrile-water (6:94, v/v) mobile phase (pH 5.0)
   containing 15 mM TPA and small amounts of acetic acid was used at a
   flow-rate of 0.6 ml min(-1), the three anions could be eluted within 32
   min. Calibration plots of peak height versus concentration for sulfide
   (detected as thiocyanate) and thiosulfate gave straight lines up to 35
   and 60 mu M, respectively. The calibration plot for sulfide coincided
   with that obtained by using thiocyanate. A calibration plot for sulfite,
   measured as sulfate, was also linear up to 135 mu M and was in accord
   with that of sulfate. Each calibration plot gave a correlation
   coefficient greater than 0.999. For six replicates obtained for a
   mixture of 30.0 mu M sulfide, 50.0 mu M sulfite, 50.0 mu M sulfate and
   20.0 mu M thiosulfate, the proposed method gave a mean value of 30.1 mu
   M with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.77 mu M and a relative standard
   deviation (RSD) of 2.6\% for sulfide, 10 1 mu M (SD = 3.5 mu M, RSD =
   3.5\%) for the total of sulfite and sulfate and 20.1 mu M (SD = 0.44 mu
   M, RSD = 2.2\%) for thiosulfate. Recoveries for sulfide, sulfite plus
   sulfate, and thiosulfate in hot-spring water samples using the proposed
   method were found to be quantitative. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular deposition of
   amyloid-beta-peptide (A beta), which is closely associated with the
   metabolic balance between AP production and clearance activities.
   Neprilysin is one of the important enzymes to degrade AP in the brain
   and alternation of its activity would contribute to the AD
   neuropathology. However, measurement of neprilysin activity in neuronal
   cells, especially the extracellular activity, is very difficult because
   of its weak activities. In the present study, we established a sensitive
   method enough to estimate extracellular neprilysin activity of living
   cell cultivated in a 96-well plate using HPLC-fluorometric system, and
   investigated the effect of hypoxia, a closely associated event with
   neurodegenerative diseases, on neprilysin activity of human
   neuroblastorna SH-SY5Y cells. We demonstrated that chronic but not acute
   hypoxia significantly attenuated neprilysin activity without any
   alterations of neprilysin gene expression. The present study suggests
   that chronic hypoxia may down-regulate extracellular neprilysin activity
   of neuronal cells to impair AP degradation and associate with the
   development of amyloid pathology. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{It is widely recognized that the presence of residual moisture has
   significant detrimental effects on the performance of lithium ion
   batteries. Studies have shown that the positive active material can be a
   major source of moisture contributors to the overall cell moisture. The
   aim of the present study is to understand the factors affecting moisture
   uptake by the doped-lithium nickel cobalt oxide material from the
   casting solvent, acetone, and the ambient environment. As-is and the
   air-dried powders under various conditions (300 degrees C for 24 h, 500
   degrees C for 8 h, and 500 degrees C for 24 h) were exposed to ambient
   and humid air for various lengths of time. Similarly, all these powders
   were exposed to extra dry (47 ppm) and wet (5789 ppm) acetone. Karl
   Fisher measurements at 160 degrees C and 290 degrees C show that
   humidity levels (80-85\% relative humidity versus 20-25\%) and the
   exposure times are the critical factors. Acetone wetness and the length
   of exposure in it do not contribute significantly to the moisture uptake
   by the active material. Cathode powder drying helps in minimizing the
   amount of moisture uptake from the environment. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Baroclinic forcing of the barotropic flow in the East Greenland Current
   in Fram Strait ( EGC(FS)) is studied using theoretical analysis and
   climatological data. First, the validity of the arrested topographic
   wave ( ATW) vorticity balance is reexamined. Then, a distribution of the
   net ( depth- averaged) relative geostrophic flow and the associated
   along- isobath variations of the bottom density are estimated from the
   Polar Science Center Hydrographic Climatology ( Seattle, Washington,
   United States). The effect of the along- isobath bottom density
   variations is referred to as JEBAR(b) in order to distinguish it from
   the famous JEBAR ( joint effect of baroclinicity and relief), which
   involves depth- integrated density variations. It is shown that the
   JEBARb is able to maintain a significant bottom geostrophic flow in the
   climatological EGCFS. Estimates of the JEBAR(b) at 79 degrees N
   correspond to an increase of the magnitude of the flow by similar to 3
   cm s(-1) over a distance of 200 km along the continental slope. An
   analytical solution for the flow that is driven by a constant JEBARb
   term and satisfies the ATW vorticity balance is then obtained in a
   domain bounded by two parallel isobaths. Finally, the JEBAR(b) is
   related to the JEBAR. It is shown that while the JEBAR(b) maintains the
   curl of the Coriolis force associated with the bottom geostrophic flow,
   the JEBAR maintains the curl of the net Coriolis force associated with
   the absolute geostrophic flow. In the climatological EGC(FS) over the
   continental slope, the JEBAR is nearly equal to the JEBAR(b).}},

Abstract = {{BAP31, a resident integral protein of the endoplasmic reticulum
   membrane, regulates the export of other integral membrane proteins to
   the downstream secretory pathway. Here we show that cell surface
   expression of the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 is compromised in mouse
   cells from which the Bap31 gene has been deleted. CD9 and CD81
   facilitate the function of multiprotein complexes at the plasma
   membrane, including integrins. Of note, BAP31 does not appear to
   influence the egress of alpha 5 beta 1 or alpha v beta 3 integrins to
   the cell surface, but in Bap31-null mouse cells, these integrins are not
   able to maintain cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix in the
   presence of reduced serum. Consequently, Bap31-null cells are sensitive
   to serum starvation-induced apoptosis. Reconstitution of wild-type BAP31
   into these Bap31-null cells restores integrin-mediated cell attachment
   and cell survival after serum stress, whereas interference with the
   functions of CD9, alpha 5 beta 1, or alpha v beta 3 by antagonizing
   antibodies makes BAP31 cells act similar to Bap31-null cells in these
   respects. Finally, in human KB epithelial cells protected from apoptosis
   by BCL-2, the caspase-8 cleavage product, p20 BAP31, inhibits egress of
   tetraspanin and integrin-mediated cell attachment. Thus, p20 BAP31 can
   operate upstream of BCL-2 in living cells to influence cell surface
   properties due to its effects on protein egress from the endoplasmic
   reticulum.}},

   equilibrium dynamics of phenol complexation to benzene in a
   benzene-carbon tetrachloride solvent mixture were measured in real time
   by the appearance of off-diagonal peaks in the two-dimensional
   vibrational echo spectrum of the phenol hydroxyl stretch. The
   dissociation time constant tau(d) for the phenol-benzene complex was 8
   picoseconds. Adding two electron-donating methyl groups to the benzene
   nearly tripled the value of tau(d) and stabilized the complex, whereas
   bromobenzene, with an electron-withdrawing bromo group, formed a
   slightly weaker complex with a slightly lower,tau(d). The spectroscopic

Abstract = {{Model compounds, of reasonable size, which have chelating chemical
   functions (carboxylic, catechol, hydroxy-carbonyl) analogues with those
   met in the biopolymer of the organic matter of the soils, were studied
   so as to better understand the complexation processes of metal ions. The
   present paper reports on spectroscopic investigation of the complex
   formation of lead (II) with some hydroxyflavones. The purpose of this
   study is to determine the stoichiometric composition and stability
   constants of the complexes formed between Pb(II) and 3-hydroxyflavone,
   5-hydroxyflavone and 3 `,4 `-dihydroxyflavone, respectively, in order to
   propose a classification of potential sites according to their chelating
   capacity. The combined use of electronic absorption spectroscopy and
   chemometrics methods allows reaching this objective. We have shown, that
   in methanol solution, the catechol function presents the greatest
   affinity for Pb(II) and leads to complex formation of higher
   stoichiometry than the other sites. The comparison of the results
   obtained for the complexation of Pb(II) and Al(III) shows a very
   different behaviour of the studied sites with respect to these two
   metals. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{TiNi films were prepared by co-sputtering TiNi and Ti targets. X-ray

   of the films and interfacial structure of Si/TiNi system. Exposure of
   the TiNi film to the ambient atmosphere (23 degrees C and 80\%
   relatively humidity) facilitated quick adsorption of oxygen and carbon
   on the surface. With time, carbon and oxygen content increased
   drastically at the surface, while oxygen diffused further into the
   layer. After a year, carbon content at the surface became as high as
   65.57\% and Ni dropped below the detection limit of XPS. Depth profiling
   revealed that significant inter-diffusion occurred between TiNi film and
   Si substrate with a layer of 90-100 nm. The detailed bond changes of
   different elements with depth were obtained using XPS and the formation
   of titanium silicides at the interface were identified. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Synthesis of beta-D-Gal-(1 -> 3)-beta-D-GalNAc coupled to
   HOC2H4NHCOC15H30SH is described. This compound was coadsorbed at various
   proportions with C2H5OC2H4NHCOC15H30SH to form statistically mixed
   self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold in an attempt to mimic the
   properties of the active domain in antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs). The
   monolayers were characterized by null ellipsometry, contact angle
   goniometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and infrared
   reflection-absorption spectroscopy. The disaccharide compound adsorbed
   preferentially, and SAMs prepared at a solution molar ratio > 0.3
   displayed total wetting. The mixed SAMs showed well-organized alkyl
   chains up to a disaccharide surface fraction of 0.8. The amount of
   gauche conformers in the alkyls increased rapidly above this point, and
   the monolayers became disordered and less densely packed. Furthermore,
   the generated mixed SAMs were subjected to water vapor at constant
   relative humidity and the subsequent ice crystallization on a cooled
   substrate was monitored via an optical microscope. Interestingly, rapid
   crystallization occurred within a narrow range of temperatures on mixed
   SAMs with a high disaccharide content, surface fraction > 0.3. The
   reported crystallization temperatures and the ice layer topography were
   compared with results obtained for a much simpler reference system
   composed of -OH/-CH3 terminated n-alkanethiols in order to account for
   changes in topography of the water/ice layer with surface energy.
   Although preliminary, the obtained results can be useful in the search
   for the molecular mechanism behind the antifreeze activity of AFGPs.}},

Abstract = {{Ferroelectric materials are widely used in modern electric devices such
   as memory elements, filtering devices and high-performance insulators.
   Ferroelectric crystals have a spontaneous electric polarization arising
   from the coherent arrangement of electric dipoles(1) ( specifically, a
   polar displacement of anions and cations). First-principles
   calculations(2,3) and electron density analysis(4) of ferroelectric
   materials have revealed that the covalent bond between the anions and
   cations, or the orbital hybridization of electrons on both ions, plays a
   key role in establishing the dipolar arrangement. However, an
   alternative model - electronic ferroelectricity(5) - has been proposed
   in which the electric dipole depends on electron correlations, rather
   than the covalency. This would offer the attractive possibility of
   ferroelectric materials that could be controlled by the charge, spin and
   orbital degrees of freedom of the electron. Here we report experimental
   evidence for ferroelectricity arising from electron correlations in the
   triangular mixed valence oxide, LuFe2O4. Using resonant X-ray scattering
   measurements, we determine the ordering of the Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions. They
   form a superstructure that supports an electric polarization consisting
   of distributed electrons of polar symmetry. The polar ordering arises
   from the repulsive property of electrons - electron correlations -
   acting on a frustrated geometry.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature dependence of the kinetics of reactive diffusion was
   theoretically analyzed for a hypothetical binary system consisting of
   one compound phase (beta) and two primary solid solution phases (alpha
   and gamma). The growth rate of the beta phase due to the reactive
   diffusion between the alpha and gamma phases in a semi-infinite
   diffusion couple was mathematically described as a function of the
   interdiffusion coefficients and the solubility ranges of the alpha, beta
   and gamma phases. For simplicity, however, the solubility ranges of all
   the phases were assumed to take an equivalent constant value. On the
   other hand, the interdiffusion coefficient Do was expressed as a
   function of the temperature T by the equation of Arrhenius-form D-theta
   = D-0(theta) exp(-Q(theta)IRT). Here, D-0(beta) is the pre-exponential
   factor, Q(theta) the activation enthalpy, R the gas constant, and theta
   stands for alpha, beta and gamma. Furthermore, we assumed D-0(alpha) =
   D-0(beta) = D-0(gamma). For the reactive diffusion controlled by the
   volume diffusion, the square of the 0 0 thickness I of the P phase is
   proportional to the annealing time t as l(2) = Kt. When Q(alpha) =
   Q(beta) = Q(gamma), the temperature dependence of K is exactly described
   by the equation K = K-0 exp(-Q(K)/RT), and Q(K) coincides with Q(alpha),
   Q(beta) and Q(gamma). Although this equation becomes merely
   approximation unless Q(alpha), Q(beta) and Q(gamma) are equivalent, it
   is sufficiently reliable within usual experimental errors for
   determination of K. QK is still close to Q at Q(alpha) = Q gamma >
   Q(beta), whereas it becomes greater than Q(beta) at Q(alpha) = Q(gamma)
   < Q(beta). Consequently, the temperature dependence of D-beta is
   estimated directly from that of K in the former case but not in the
   latter case. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neutral models in landscape ecology that have been used as a framework
   to analyze actual landscapes have been largely planar. However, the
   natural world is greater than two dimensions; hence, many ecological
   structures, e.g., forest canopies or coral reefs, are better represented
   by topographies or tomographies. Because pattern and process or
   structure and function are intertwined, it becomes necessary. to develop
   methods to quantify these complex architectures. With the advent of
   remote sensing technologies such as lidars and sonars, that permit
   structural mapping of some of these systems, volumetric data are
   becoming more prevalent. In this study, we developed a suite of binary
   voxel-based neutral models that possessed random, anisotropic, and
   hierarchical properties. We then evaluated the extent to which
   fractal-derived measurements, i.e., lacunarity, the simple fractal
   dimension, and multifractal spectra, were able to discern among the
   constructed model types at two different densities (p = 0.02 and p =
   0.05). Multifractal analysis, where spectra were defined by three
   parameters, was shown to be the most sensitive to the differences among
   the neutral structures. Lactunarity, defined by a single parameter, was
   shown to be fairly useful in discerning the structures. The simple
   fractal dimension was found to have limited capability. To more fully
   assess the ability of these and additional pattern recognition methods,
   better representations of natural morphologies need to be developed and
   analyzed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The micellization of a novel family of nonionic surfactants
   poly(oxyethylene) glycol alkyl ethers has been studied by
   microcalorimetry. One of the surfactants has adamantane, and the other
   nonionic surfactants have a benzene ring in their hydrophobic chains,
   which moves from the terminal of the hydrophobic chain toward the
   headgroup. Moreover, the alkyl chain of the nonionic surfactants is
   straight or branched. Both the critical micelle concentration (cmc) and
   the thermodynamic parameters associated with the micelle formation have
   been obtained. The cmc decreases and the enthalpy of micelle formation
   (Delta H-mic) becomes less positive gradually as the length of
   hydrophobic chain increases, whereas the values of cmc and Delta H-mic
   tend to increase for the surfactants with a longer ethylene oxide chain.
   However, the Delta H-mic, value of the surfactant with seven carbon
   atoms in a hydrophobic chain is more positive than that of the
   surfactant with six carbon atoms in a hydrophobic chain. Comparing with
   the nonionic surfactant with a methylene hydrophobic chain, the
   surfactants with benzene rings and adamantane groups have larger cmc
   values and the cmc values increase with the size of the groups.
   Furthermore, moving the phenyl group from the terminal of the
   hydrophobic chain to the neighbor of the hydrophilic headgroup leads to
   the decreased cmc. Both the variation of hydrophobic interaction from
   the movement of phenyl group and pi-pi interaction among adjacent phenyl
   groups affect Delta H-mic values.}},

Abstract = {{A thermodynamic analysis is presented for electrically charged mixed
   micelles in water on the basis of the Gibbs-Duhem relation proposed by
   Hall in combination with the information on the degree of counterion
   binding. The proposed analyses are shown to work well for both
   ionic/nonionic mixed micelles and those consisting of ionic surfactants
   of like charges. Conclusions for ionic/nonionic mixed micelles are as
   follows. (1) The contribution from counterions is significant. (2) In
   media of low ionic strengths, the counterion concentration varies with
   the micellar mole fraction of the ionic species x. The dependency of the
   activity coefficients and the excess free energy on x is significantly
   influenced by this effect, but it can be corrected to a large extent in
   terms of the Corrin-Harkins relation. (3) The regular solution theory
   (RST) is not always valid even when the excess free energy is described
   well with the RST expression unless the observed range of the micelle
   composition is wide enough. (4) The RST overestimates x and
   underestimates the activity coefficient of the ionic species when
   applied to the mixed micelles to which it is inapplicable. For the ionic
   mixed micelles consisting of surfactants of like charges, the
   Lange-Shinoda approach is shown to be consistent with the present
   analysis in terms of the Gibbs-Duhem relation, but Motomura's approach
   is found to be not exact but approximate.}},

Title = {{Overwhelming O+ contribution to the plasma sheet energy density during
   the October 2003 superstorm: Geotail/EPIC and IMAGE/LENA observations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{110}},

Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] We studied dynamics of O+ ions during the superstorm that occurred
   on 29 - 31 October 2003, using energetic (9 - 210 keV/e) ion flux data
   obtained by the energetic particle and ion composition (EPIC) instrument
   on board the Geotail satellite and neutral atom data in the energy range
   of 10 eV to a few keV acquired by the low-energy neutral atom (LENA)
   imager on board the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration
   (IMAGE) satellite. Since the low-energy neutral atoms are created from
   the outflowing ionospheric ions by the charge exchange process, we could
   examine variations of ionospheric ion outflow with the IMAGE/LENA data.
   In the near-Earth plasma sheet of X-GSM similar to - 6 R-E to - 8.5 R-E,
   we found that the H+ energy density showed no distinctive differences
   between the superstorm and quiet intervals ( 1 - 10 keV cm(-3)), while
   the O+ energy density increased from 0.05 - 3 keV cm(-3) during the
   quiet intervals to similar to 100 keV cm(-3) during the superstorm. The
   O+/ H+ energy density ratio reached 10 - 20 near the storm maximum,
   which is the largest ratio in the near-Earth plasma sheet ever observed
   by Geotail, indicating more than 90\% of O+ in the total energy density.
   We argued that such extreme increase of the O+/ H+ energy density ratio
   during the October 2003 superstorm was due to mass-dependent
   acceleration of ions by storm-time substorms as well as an additional
   supply of O+ ions from the ionosphere to the plasma sheet. We compared
   the ion composition between the ring current and the near-Earth plasma
   sheet reported by previous studies and found that they are rather
   similar. On the basis of the similarity, we estimated that the ring
   current had the O+/ H+ energy density ratio as large as 10 - 20 for the
   October 2003 superstorm.}},

Abstract = {{Hassall's corpuscles - first described in the human thymus over 150
   years ago(1) - are groups of epithelial cells within the thymic medulla.
   The physical nature of these structures differs between mammalian
   species(2). Although Hassall's corpuscles have been proposed to act in
   both the removal of apoptotic thymocytes(3,4) and the maturation of
   developing thymocytes(5) within the thymus, the function of Hassall's
   corpuscles has remained an enigma. Here we report that human Hassall's
   corpuscles express thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP). Human TSLP
   activates thymic CD11c-positive dendritic cells to express high levels
   of CD80 and CD86. These TSLP-conditioned dendritic cells are then able
   to induce the proliferation and differentiation of CD4(+) CD8(-) CD25(-)
   thymic T cells into CD4(+) CD25(+) FOXP3(+) (forkhead box P3) regulatory
   T cells. This induction depends on peptide - major histocompatibility
   complex class II interactions, and the presence of CD80 and CD86, as
   well as interleukin 2. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that CD25(+)
   CTLA4(+) (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) regulatory T
   cells associate in the thymic medulla with activated or mature dendritic
   cells and TSLP-expressing Hassall's corpuscles. These findings suggest
   that Hassall's corpuscles have a critical role in
   dendritic-cell-mediated secondary positive selection of medium-to-high
   affinity self-reactive T cells, leading to the generation of CD4(+)
   CD25(+) regulatory T cells within the thymus.}},

   sensitive to precipitation variation. Spring droughts more severe than
   that of the mid- 1920s occurred in the late 1840s, mid- 1460s AD, and
   similar to mid- 1860s BC. A remarkable climatic anomaly occurred in
   similar to the 19th century BC during which strong pentadecadal
   oscillation prevailed and radial growth decreased by 71\% in four years.
   This event could have been the final stage in the process of climatic
   and environmental transition beginning 2 - 3 centuries earlier that led
   to major cultural transformation in regions sensitive to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{A blueberry extract (A) and two anthocyanin-derived extracts (B and C)
   were prepared. The contents of polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins,
   and anthocyanin-derived pigments of the extracts were determined for the
   first time. The pigment profile of blueberry extract A corresponded to
   15 anthocyanins, whereas extract B was mainly composed of
   anthocyanin-pyruvic acid adducts of the blueberry original anthocyanins
   and extract C was mainly composed of the respective
   vinylpyrano-anthocyanin-catechins (portisins). The extracts' abilities
   to inhibit lipid peroxidation, induced by
   2,2'-azobis(2-methyl-propanimidamide) dihydrochloride in a liposomal
   membrane system were examined. The antioxidant capacities of the
   extracts were evaluated through monitoring oxygen consumption and by
   measuring the formation of conjugated dienes. All of the extracts
   provided protection of membranes against peroxyl radicals by increasing
   the induction time of oxidation. This effect increased with the
   polyphenol content and with the structural complexity of the
   anthocyan-inderived pigments of the extracts. The pigments present in
   extract C seemed to induce a higher protection of the liposome membranes
   toward oxidation. In addition, the antiradical properties and the
   reducing power of the extracts were determined by using DPPH and FRAP
   methods, respectively. The results from these assays were in agreement
   with those obtained with the liposome membranes.}},

Abstract = {{The mid-Holocene ( 6000 years before present) North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO) from nine models in the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison
   Project Phase 2 is studied, primarily through principal component
   analysis of winter time North Atlantic sea level pressure (SLP). Modeled
   mid-Holocene NAO and mean SLP show small changes compared to
   pre-industrial control runs, with a shift in mean state towards a more
   positive NAO regime for three of the models. Modeled NAO variability
   shows little change, with a small increase for some models in the
   fraction of time spent in the NAO-negative phase during the
   mid-Holocene. Proxy based reconstructions of the NAO indicate a more
   positive NAO regime compared to present day during the mid-Holocene. We
   hypothesise that there was a small NAO+ like shift in mean state during
   the mid-Holocene.}},

Abstract = {{A trichloroacetic acid treatment at 140 degrees C for 40 min was
   successfully established as a suitable solvolysis procedure for the
   recovery of bound deoxynivalenol or its derivatives in Fusarium-infected
   plants. Deoxynivalenol itself was not decomposed in the procedure. The
   derivative 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol was chosen as a model compound for
   setting free deoxynivalenol in an acid-catalyzed deesterification
   reaction, developing the method. This is the first report using a
   trichloroacetic acid solvolysis procedure as a sample incubation step to
   free bound deoxynivalenol and determine free from bound deoxynivalenol
   in the sample. Between 13 and 63\% of the total deoxynivalenol consisted
   of nonextractable deoxynivalenol. Deoxynivalenol contents in grain of
   the susceptible cultivar ``Agent{''} infected with Fusarium spp. were
   12-24 times higher when compared to those for the corresponding
   moderately resistant cultivar ``Petrus{''}. The highest deoxynivalenol
   amounts were determined in grain infected with Fusarium spp. as well as
   simultaneously infected with BYDV. This solvolysis procedure may be of
   importance for distinguishing between resistant and susceptible plants
   and their ability to immobilize (bound) mycotoxins as a plant defense
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Endosulfan is a potentially harmful, degradation resistant pesticide
   that is found in soils where it has been used. Despite being hydrophobic
   and having high affinity for soil matrix components, it has also been
   found in groundwater. To investigate this behavior, we studied the
   passage of a commercial emulsified formulation through a column of
   aggregated vineyard soil under simulated light rain. Breakthrough data
   were obtained using gas chromatography with electron capture detection
   to determine the concentration of endosulfan in samples extracted from
   the column periodically at several depths. These data, and analogous
   data obtained previously for the passage of bromide, were analyzed using
   the program CXTFIT v.2. Analysis of the bromide data strongly suggested
   the existence of preferential flow paths in the column. The endosulfan
   data were adequately accounted for by a model in which the preferential
   flow and nonpreferential flow regions are almost isolated from each
   other. These regions differ also as regards both the partition of
   endosulfan between soil and soil solution and the rate at which
   reversibly adsorbed endosulfan is transformed into irreversibly adsorbed
   endosulfan. The ``irreversibility{''} sink term accounts also for
   biological and chemical degradation of endosulfan. The findings imply
   that soil humidity favors the transport of commercial endosulfan by the
   formation and maintenance of preferential flow paths in soil,
   controlling both the presence of endosulfan in groundwater and its high
   persistence in soil.}},

Abstract = {{Cereals contaminated by Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., and Fusarium
   sop. and their mycotoxins, for example, ochratoxin A (OTA) and
   deoxynivalenol (DON), are not only a risk to human and animal health but
   can also show poor technological properties and baking quality. The
   influence of these genera on the sulfur speciation of low molecular
   weight (LMW) subunits of glutenin was characterized by investigating
   suboptimally stored wheat samples in situ by X-ray absorption near edge
   structure (XANES) spectroscopy and baking tests. Field fungi of the
   genus Fusarium have hardly any influence on both the sulfur speciation
   of wheat gluten proteins and the baking properties, whereas storage
   fungi of the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium have a direct influence.
   An increased amount of sulfur in sulfonic acid state was found, which is
   not available for thiol/disulfide exchange reactions in the gluten
   network, and thus leads to a considerably reduced baking volume. From
   changes of the composition of the mould flora during suboptimal storage
   of wheat and from the mycotoxin contents, it can be concluded that
   microbial competitive interactions play an important role in the
   development of the mould flora and the mycotoxin concentrations during
   (suboptimal) storage of wheat.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Climate variability over the Greenland ice sheet associated with
   the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is simulated with the Polar MM5

   Ensemble differences between the high and low NAO cases are discussed,

   automatic weather stations over Greenland. PMM5 is shown to reproduce
   several well-known features of NAO-related climate variability in the

   subject to the mass balance dynamics as well as the PBE. The results for
   natural cooling, linear cooling and optimal cooling are compared. The
   sensitivity of the optimal solution with respect to the model parameters

Abstract = {{Optical quality NaLnF(4) single crystals have been obtained from
   nonstoichiometric melts through the Czochralski technique, for Ln = La,
   Ce, Pr, Sm, Eu, and Gd. These crystals are potential laser host
   materials because of their high luminescence efficiency when doped with
   rare earth ions. In view of this application, the knowledge of the
   optical phonon modes of the crystals is mandatory. In this work, we
   present our polarized Raman scattering and infrared reflectivity studies
   of NaLnF4 single crystals for large ionic radius lanthanides. For the
   different Ln ions, the spectra in each polarized configuration appeared
   to be very similar; the effect of Ln ion substitution on the crystal's
   vibrational modes was generally the hardening of the modes with
   decreasing ionic radii, with no important symmetry evolution. For all
   investigated crystals, the symmetries and number of observed phonon
   modes agree well with group theory predictions for the hexagonal A
   group. The rather broad phonon bands and the presence of defect modes
   evidence the cationic disorder allowed by this structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports our initial efforts to promote electronic
   communications across polycyclic aromatic molecules through intervening
   metal halide moieties. Such efforts stand as part of the larger scheme
   to overcome the limitation of the van der Waals barrier in molecular
   semiconductors. In particular, the polycyclic aromatic ligands of
   2,3,6,7,10,11-hexakis(alkylthio)triphenylene (alkyl: methyl, ethyl, and
   isopropyl; corresponding abbreviations for the molecules, HMTT, HETT,
   and HiPTT) were synthesized in an improved method, and interacted with
   bismuth(III) bromide and chloride to produce in high yields of a series
   of semiconductive hybrid networks featuring flexible network
   dimensionalities and electronic properties, as well as promising
   solution processing properties. Enlarging the side group from methyl to
   ethyl and to isopropyl groups effectively reduces the dimensionality of
   the bismuth halide components (and consequently the dimensionality of
   the overall coordination framework). Solid-state optical absorption
   measurements indicate effective electronic interactions between the
   organic pi-system and the bismuth trihalide component, and the
   electronic band gap decreases monotonically with increasing
   dimensionality of the coordination network. As compared to molecular
   semiconductors, these integrated hybrid networks feature stronger
   electronic communication across the organic molecules, and point to
   potentially higher charge carrier mobilities.}},

Abstract = {{Ca2+ sparks as the elementary intracellular Ca2+ release events are
   instrumental to local control of Ca2+ signaling in many types of cells.
   Here, we visualized neural Ca2+ sparks in dorsal root ganglion (DRG)
   sensory neurons and investigated possible role of DRG sparks in the
   regulation of secretion from the somata of the cell. DRG sparks arose
   mainly from type 3 ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels on
   subsurface cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, rendering a striking
   subsurface localization. Caffeine- or
   3,7-dimethyl-1-(2-propynyl)xanthine-induced store Ca2+ release, in the
   form of Ca2+ sparks, triggered exocytosis, independently of membrane
   depolarization and external Ca2+. The spark-secretion coupling
   probability was estimated to be between 1 vesicle per 6.6 sparks and 1
   vesicle per 11.4 sparks. During excitation, subsurface sparks were
   evoked by physiological Ca2+ entry via the Ca2+- induced Ca2+ release
   mechanism, and their synergistic interaction with Ca2+ influx accounted
   for approximate to 60\% of the Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Furthermore,
   inhibition of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release abolished endotoxin-induced
   secretion of pain-related neuropeptides. These findings underscore an
   important role for Ca2+ sparks in the amplification of surface Ca2+
   influx and regulation of neural secretion.}},

Abstract = {{Photosystem II (PSII) electron transfer (ET) in the chlorophyll
   d-containing cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina (A. marina) was studied
   by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy at
   room temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence, and low-temperature optical
   spectroscopy. To maximize the ability to measure PSII ET in the intact
   cells of this organism, growth conditions were optimized to provide the
   highest specific 02 activity and the instrumental parameters for the EPR
   measurements of tyrosine Z (Y-Z) reduction were adjusted to give the
   best signal-to-noise over spectral resolution. Analysis of the Y-Z.
   reduction kinetics revealed that ET to the oxygen-evolving complex on
   the donor side of PSII in A. marina is indistinguishable from that in
   higher plants and other cyanobacteria. Likewise, the charge
   recombination kinetics between the first plastoquinone acceptor Q(A) and
   the donor side of PSII monitored by the chlorophyll fluorescence decay
   on the seconds time scale are not significantly different between A.
   marina and non-chlorophyll d organisms, while low-temperature optical
   absorption spectroscopy identified the primary electron acceptor in A.
   marina as pheophytin a. The results indicate that, if the PSII primary
   electron donor in A. marina is made up of chlorophyll d instead of
   chlorophyll a, then there must be very different interactions with the
   protein environment to account for the ET properties, which are similar
   to higher plants and other cyanobacteria. Nevertheless, the water
   oxidation mechanism in A. marina is kinetically unaltered.}},

Abstract = {{Several lines of evidence suggest that programmed cell death may play a
   role in the aging process and the age-related functional declines of
   multicellular organisms. To pave the way for the use of Drosophila to
   rigorously test this hypothesis in a genetic model organism, this work
   examines the pattern of apoptosis in the adult fly during aging. The
   analysis across the lifespan of caspase activity and DNA fragmentation
   shows that apoptosis occurs in adult flies at all ages and that it is
   linked to physiological age. The results establish that under normal
   conditions, fly aging is coupled with a lifelong gradual increase of
   apoptosis within muscle cells and an activation of apoptosis in fat
   cells of old flies. The nervous system does not show signs of apoptosis.
   These time- and tissue-specific changes indicate that aging influences
   the levels and the nature of the cells that commit to apoptosis. The
   comparison with the apoptotic response to starvation and oxidative
   stresses strongly suggests that the lifelong increase in flight and leg
   muscles results from the accumulation of oxidative damage associated
   with aging. This finding presents an attractive mechanism to account for
   the decline of locomotor functions and muscle loss in the elderly and
   opens the way for the genetic analysis of sarcopenia in Drosophila.}},

   polycrystalline aggregates has been studied by measurements of the
   dielectric and elastic properties as a function of temperature. The
   ferroelectric to relaxor transition seems to present a regime of
   ferroelectric fluctuations that is sharply interrupted by the appearance
   of the polar nanodomains. It also presents thermal hysteresis, not only
   in the transition temperature, T-c, but in the characteristic time scale
   of the ferroelectric fluctuations that is longer on cooling than on

Abstract = {{Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major complication of heavy alcohol
   (EtOH) drinking and is characterized by three progressive stages of
   pathology: steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis/cirrhosis. Alcoholic
   steatosis (AS) is the initial stage of ALD and consists of fat
   accumulation in the liver accompanied by minimal liver injury. AS is
   known to render the hepatocytes increasingly sensitive to toxicants such
   as bacterial endotoxin (LPS). Alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), the
   second and rate-limiting step in the progression of ALD, is
   characterized by hepatic fat accumulation, neutrophil infiltration, and
   neutrophil-mediated parenchymal injury. However, the pathogenesis of ASH
   is poorly defined. It has been theorized that the pathogenesis of ASH
   involves interaction of increased circulating levels of LPS with
   hepatocytes being rendered highly sensitive to LPS due to heavy EtOH
   consumption. We hypothesize that osteopontin (OPN), a matricellular
   protein (MCP), plays an important role in the hepatic neutrophil
   recruitment due to its enhanced expression during the early phase of ALD
   (AS and ASH). To study the role of OPN in the pathogenesis of ASH, we
   induced AS in male Sprague-Dawley rats by feeding EtOH-containing
   Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet for 6 weeks. AS rats experienced extensive
   fat accumulation and minimal liver injury. Moderate induction in OPN was
   observed in AS group. ASH was induced by feeding male Sprague-Dawley
   rats EtOH-containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet for 6 weeks followed by
   LPS injection. The ASH rats had substantial neutrophil infiltration,
   coagulative oncotic necrosis, and developed higher liver injury.
   Significant increases in the hepatic and circulating levels of OPN was
   observed in the ASH rats. Higher levels of the active, thrombin-cleaved
   form of OPN in the liver in ASH group correlated remarkably with hepatic
   neutrophil infiltration. Finally, correlative studies between OPN and
   hepatic neutrophil infiltration was corroborated in a simple rat
   peritoneal model where enhanced peritoneal fluid neutrophil infiltration
   was noted in rats injected OPN intraperitoneally. Taken together these
   data indicate that OPN expression induced during ASH may play a
   significant role in the pathogenesis of ASH by stimulating neutrophil
   transmigration. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the addition of hydrogen-consuming microorganisms on the
   metabolism of Clostridium thermolacticum was studied. By growing this
   bacterium in continuous culture at 58 degrees C, on 29 mmol lactose
   l(-1) (10 g l(-1)) in the feed, with the H-2-consuming microorganisms
   Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus and Moorella thermoautotrophica,
   the volumetric productivity of acetate was increased up to 3.9 mmol
   l(-1) h(-1) at a dilution rate of 0.058 h(-1). This was about three
   times higher than the maximal acetate volumetric productivity
   quiantified when C. thermolacticum was cultivated alone. In the
   consortium, C. thermolacticum was the only species able to metabolize
   lactose; it produced not only acetate, but also hydrogen, carbon dioxide
   and lactate. The other species of the consortium were growing on these
   by-products. Meth. thermoautotrophicus played an important role as a
   very efficient hydrogen scavenger and decreased the hydrogen partial
   pressure drastically: hydrogen was converted to methane. Moor.
   thermoautotrophica converted lactate as well as hydrogen and carbon
   dioxide into acetate. As a consequence, lactose was efficiently consumed
   and the only organic product in the liquid phase was acetate. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Synaptic vesicle release occurs at a specialized membrane domain known
   as the presynaptic active zone (AZ). Several membrane proteins are
   involved in the vesicle release processes such as docking, priming, and
   exocytotic fusion. Cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) proteins are
   structural components of the AZ and are highly concentrated in it.
   Localization of other release-related proteins including target soluble
   N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor (t-SNARE)
   proteins, however, has not been well demonstrated in the AZ. Here, we
   used sodium dodecyl sulfate-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling
   (SDS-FRL) to analyze quantitatively the distribution of CAZ and t-SNARE
   proteins in the hippocampal CA3 area. The AZ in replicated membrane was
   identified by immunolabeling for CAZ proteins (CAZ-associated structural
   protein {[}CAST] and Bassoon). Clusters of immunogold particles for
   these proteins were found on the P-face of presynaptic terminals of the
   mossy fiber and associational/commissural (A/C) fiber. Co-labeling with
   CAST revealed distribution of the t-SNARE proteins syntaxin and
   synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) in the AZ as well as
   in the extrasynaptic membrane surrounding the AZ (SZ). Quantitative
   analysis demonstrated that the density of immunoparticles for CAST in
   the AZ was more than 100 times higher than in the SZ, whereas that for
   syntaxin and SNAP-25 was not significantly different between the AZ and
   SZ in both the A/C and mossy fiber terminals. These results support the
   involvement of the t-SNARE proteins in exocytotic fusion in the AZ and
   the role of CAST in specialization of the membrane domain for the AZ.

Abstract = {{A novel core-shell protein nanocluster film, designated as clay-
   (Hb/PSS)(n), was fabricated on pyrolytic graphite (PG) electrodes.
   Positively charged hemoglobin (Hb) at pH 5.5 and negatively charged
   poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) were first assembled layer by layer on
   surface of clay nanoparticles from their solutions mainly by
   electrostatic attraction, forming a core-shell nanocluster structure in
   which clay nanoparticles were the ``cores{''} and (Hb/PSS)(n)
   multilayers were the ``shells{''}. The aqueous dispersion of
   clay(Hb/PSS)(n) nanoclusters was then cast on surface of PG electrodes,
   forming clay-(Hb/PSS)(n) nanocluster films after evaporation of solvent.
   Hb in clay-(Hb/PSS)(n) films exhibited a pair of well-defined and
   reversible cyclic voltammetric (CV) peaks at about -0.36 V vs. SCE in pH
   7.0 buffers, characteristic of Hb heme Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couples.
   Compared with other Hb-containing clay films, clay- (Hb/PSS)(n) films
   displayed smaller CV peak separation (Delta E-p), indicating the better
   electrochemical reversibility of Hb in these nanocluster films. The
   partially ordered structure of the films was characterized by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) experiments, UV-VIS and reflection absorption infrared
   (RAIR) spectroscopy suggests that Hb retains its near-native structure
   in clay-(Hb/PSS)(n) films. Oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and nitrite were
   catalytically reduced at clay-(Hb/PSS)(n) film electrodes, showing the
   potential applicability of the films as the new type of biosensors or
   bioreactors based on protein direct electrochemistry. The
   electrochemical and electrocatalytic activity of the films could be
   tailored by controlling the number of bilayers of the (Hb/PSS)(n) shells
   on the surface of clay nanoparticle cores. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Acquired drug resistance is a major problem in cancer treatment. To
   explore the genes involved in chemosensitivity and resistance, 10 human
   tumour cell lines, including parental cells and resistant subtypes
   selected for resistance against doxorubicin, melphalan, teniposide and
   vincristine, were profiled for mRNA expression of 7400 genes using cDNA
   microarray technology. The drug activity of 66 cancer agents was
   evaluated on the cell lines, and correlations between drug activity and
   gene expression were calculated and ranked. Hierarchical clustering of
   drugs based on their drug - gene correlations yielded clusters of drugs
   with similar mechanism of action. Genes correlated with drug sensitivity
   and resistance were imported into the PathwayAssist software to identify
   putative molecular pathways involved. A substantial number of both
   proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes such as signal transducer and
   activator of transcription 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 and
   focal adhesion kinase were found to be associated to drug resistance,
   whereas genes linked to cell cycle control and proliferation, such as
   cell division cycle 25A and signal transducer of activator of
   transcription 5A, were associated to general drug sensitivity. The
   results indicate that combined information from drug activity and gene
   expression in a resistance-based cell line panel may provide new
   knowledge of the genes involved in anticancer drug resistance and become
   a useful tool in drug development.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss how the excitation of high-frequency modes in adsorbed
   molecules may result in motion (e.g., rotation, translation, or

   to linear and quadratic dependences of the reaction rate on the
   tunneling current in the case the scanning tunneling microscopy is used
   to excite the vibrations (inelastic tunneling). From the results
   reported in this paper it should be possible to obtain intramolecular
   transition rates directly from the experimental data, and gain some

Title = {{Phase-space overlap measures. II. Design and implementation of staging
   methods for free-energy calculations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{We consider staged free-energy calculation methods in the context of
   phase-space overlap relations, and argue that the selection of
   work-based methods should be guided by consideration of the phase-space
   overlap of the systems of interest. Stages should always be constructed
   such that work is performed only into a system that has a phase-space
   subset relation with the starting system. Thus multiple stages are
   required if the systems of interest are not such that one forms a
   phase-space subset with the other. Three two-stage methods are possible,
   termed umbrella sampling, overlap sampling, and funnel sampling. The
   last is appropriate for cases in which the subset relation holds, but
   only in the extreme, meaning that one system's important phase space
   constitutes a very small portion of the others. Umbrella sampling is
   most suitable for nonoverlap systems, and overlap sampling is
   appropriate for systems exhibiting partial phase-space overlap. We
   review recently introduced metrics that characterize phase-space
   overlap, showing that the performance of the single- and two-stage
   methods is consistent with the phase-space picture. We also demonstrate
   that a recently introduced bias-detection measure is effective in
   identifying inaccuracy in single- and multistage calculations. The
   examples used are the chemical-potential calculation for a Lennard-Jones
   liquid at moderate and at high densities, the same for model water at
   ambient conditions, and a process of charging a neutral ion in water.

Abstract = {{Respiratory gating based on external surrogates is performed in many
   clinics. We have developed a new technique for treatment verification
   using an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) in cine mode for gated
   3D conformal therapy. Implanted radiopaque fiducial markers inside or
   near the target are required for this technique. The markers are
   contoured on the planning CT set, enabling us to create digitally
   reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) for each treatment beam. During the
   treatment, a sequence of EPID images can be acquired without disrupting
   the treatment. Implanted markers are visualized in the images and their
   positions in the beam's eye view are calculated off-line and compared to
   the reference position by matching the field apertures in corresponding
   EPID and DRR images. The precision of the patient setup, the placement
   of the beam-gating window, as well as the residual tumour motion can be
   assessed for each treatment fraction. This technique has been
   demonstrated with a case study patient, who had three markers implanted
   in his liver. For this patient, the intra-fractional variation of all
   marker positions in the gating window had a 95\% range of 4.8 mm in the
   SI direction (the primary axis of motion). This was about the same (5
   mm) as the residual motion considered in the planning process. The
   inter-fractional variation of the daily mean positions of the markers,
   which indicates the uncertainty in the set-up procedure, was within +8.3
   mm/-4.5 mm (95\% range) in the SI direction for this case.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a deep optical 2.6 deg(2) survey with
   near-infrared (NIR) follow-up measurements of the intermediate-aged
   Praesepe open cluster. The survey is complete to I-c = 21.3, Z = 20.5,
   corresponding to M similar to 0.06 M-circle dot assuming a cluster age
   of 0.5 Gyr. Using three to five passbands to constrain cluster
   membership, we identify 32 new low-mass cluster members, at least four
   of which are likely to be substellar. We use the low-mass census to
   trace the region where the sequence moves away from the NEXTGEN towards
   the DUSTY regime at T-eff = 2200 K. In doing so, we identify four
   unresolved binaries, yielding a substellar binary fraction (BF) of
   similar to 30 per cent. The BFs appear to decrease below 0.1 M-circle
   dot in contrast to the rising fractions found in the Pleiades. We also
   identify a paucity of late M dwarfs, thought to be due to a steepening
   in the mass-luminosity relation at these spectral types, and compare the
   properties of this gap in the sequence to those observed in younger
   clusters. We note an overdensity of faint sources in the region of the
   so-called subcluster (possibly an older smaller cluster within
   Praesepe), and subsequently derive the luminosity and mass functions
   (MFs) for the main Praesepe cluster, revealing a turnover near the
   substellar boundary. We conclude by presenting astrometric measurements
   for low-mass Praesepe candidates from the literature and rule out as a
   likely foreground dwarf RPr1, hitherto thought to be a substellar
   member.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate the effects of leptin administration on liver
   fibrosis induced by thioacetamide (TAA).
   METHODS: Twenty-four male C57Bl/6 mice were randomly allocated into four
   groups, which were intra-peritoneally given saline (2 mL/kg), leptin (1
   mg/kg), TAA (200 mg/kg), TAA (200 mg/kg) plus leptin (1 mg/kg)
   respectively, thrice a week. All mice were killed after 4 wk. The
   changes in biochemical markers, such as the levels of alanine
   aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum and
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver were
   determined. For histological analysis, liver tissues were fixed with
   10\% buffered formalin, embedded with paraffin. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE)
   staining and picric acid-Sirius red dyeing were performed. The level of
   alpha 1(I) procollagen mRNA in liver tissues was analyzed by RT- PCR.
   RESULTS: Apparent liver fibrosis was found in TAA group and TAA plus
   leptin group. Compared to saline group, the levels of ALT and AST in
   serum and MDA in liver increased in TAA group (205.67 +/- 27.69 U/L vs
   50.67 +/- 10.46 U/L, 177.50 +/- 23.65U/L vs 76.33 +/- 12.27 U/L, 2.60
   +/- 0.18 nmol/mg pro vs 1.91 +/- 0.14 nmol/ mg pro, P<0.01) and in TAA
   plus leptin group (256.17 +/- 22.50 U/L vs 50.67 +/- 10.46 U/L, 234.17
   +/- 27.37 U/L vs 76.33 +/- 12.27 U/L, 2.97 +/- 0.19 nmol/mg pro vs 1.91
   +/- 0.14 nmol/mg pro, P<0.01). The level of SOD in livers decreased
   (51.80 +/- 8.36 U/mg pro vs 81.52 +/- 11.40 U/mg pro, 35.78 +/- 6.11
   U/mg pro vs 81.52 +/- 11.40 U/mg pro, P<0.01) and the level of alpha
   1(I) procollagen mRNA in liver tissues also increased (0.28 +/- 0.04 vs
   0.11 +/- 0.02, 0.54 +/- 0.07 vs 0.11 +/- 0.02, P<0.01). But no
   significant changes were found in leptin group and saline group.
   Compared to TAA group, ALT, AST, MDA, and alpha 1(I) procollagen mRNA
   and grade of liver fibrosis in TAA plus leptin group increased (256.17
   +/- 22.50 U/L vs 205.67 +/- 27.69 U/L, P<0.05; 234.17 +/- 27.37 U/L vs
   177.50 +/- 23.65 U/L, P< 0.05; 2.97 +/- 0.19 nmol/mg pro vs 2.60 +/-
   0.18 nmol/mg pro, P<0.05; 0.54 +/- 0.07 vs 0.28 +/- 0.04, P<0.01; 3.17
   vs 2.00, P<0.05), and the level of SOD in liver decreased (35.78 +/-
   6.11 U/mg pro vs 51.80 +/- 8.36 U/mg pro, P<0.05). There were similar
   changes in the degree of type I collagen deposition confirmed by picric
   acid-Sirius red dyeing.
   CONCLUSION: Leptin can exacerbate the degree of TAA-induced liver
   fibrosis in mice. Leptin may be an important factor in the development
   of liver fibrosis. (c) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{AIM: To evaluate the seroprevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen
   (HBsAg) in 13 581 women at reproductive age and the hepatitis B e
   antigen (HBeAg)/anti-HBe status as well as serum hepatitis B virus
   (HBV)-DNA levels in a subgroup of HBsAg(+) pregnant women at labor in
   Greece.
   METHODS: Serological markers were detected using enzyme immunoassays.
   Serum HBV-DNA was determined by a sensitive quantitative PCR assay.
   Statistical analysis of data was based on parametric methodology.
   RESULTS: Overall, 1.156\% of women were HBsAg(+) and the majority of
   them (71.3\%) were Albanian. The prevalence of HBsAg was 5.1\% in
   Albanian women, 4.2\% in Asian women and 1.14\% in women from Eastern
   European countries. The prevalence of HBsAg in African (0.36\%) and
   Greek women (0.29\%) was very low. Only 4.45\% of HBsAg (+) women were
   also HBeAg(+) whereas the vast majority of them were
   HBeAg(-)/anti-HBe(+). Undetectable levels of viremia (<200 copies/mL)
   were observed in 32.26\% of pregnant women at labor and 29.03\%
   exhibited extremely low levels of viral replication (<400 copies/mL).
   Only two pregnant women exhibited extremely high serum HBV-DNA levels
   (>10 000 000 copies/mL), whereas 32.26\% exhibited HBV-DNA levels
   between 1 500 and 40 000 copies/mL.
   CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of HBsAg is relatively low among
   women at reproductive age in Greece but is higher enough among specific
   populations. The HBeAg(-)/anti-HBe(+) serological status and the
   extremely low or even undetectable viral replicative status in the
   majority of HBsAg(+) women of our study population, suggest that only a
   small proportion of HBsAg(+) women in Greece exhibit a high risk for
   vertical transmission of the infection. (c) 2005 The WJG Press and

Abstract = {{We have designed and demonstrated a compact solenoid He-3 neutron spin
   filter with a fast spin flip capability. The He-3 spin is flipped by
   adiabatic fast passage (AFP) in a short time and with very little
   polarization loss, which is essential for polarized neuron scattering
   measurements in cancellation of systematic errors. A solenoid coil and
   compensation coils provide a uniform magnetic field for the polarized
   He-3 to minimize the longitudinal spin relaxation. This neutron spin
   filter can be installed rather easily in neutron scattering
   spectrometers as a neutron polarizer as well as a neutron spin analyzer.
   We describe the design and the performance of the device tested by
   AFP-NMR and with a pulsed neutron beam at KEK. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), industrial
   radiography accounts for approximately half of all reported accidents
   for the nuclear related industry. Detailed information about these
   accidents have been published by the IAEA in its Safety Report Series,
   one of which describes the radiological accident which happened in 1999
   in Yanango/Peru. Under unsettled circumstances an Ir-192 source was lost
   from an industrial radiographic camera and later picked up by a welder,
   who normally had nothing to do with the radiographic work. The man put
   the source into the right back pocket of his jeans and continued working
   for at least another 6.5 h. This study uses the MAX/EGS4 exposure model
   in order to determine absorbed dose distributions in the right thigh of
   the MAX phantom, as well as average absorbed doses to radiosensitive
   organs and tissues. For this purpose, the Monte Carlo code for standard
   exposure situations has been modified in order to match the irradiation
   conditions of the accident as closely as possible. The results present
   the maximum voxel absorbed dose, voxel depth absorbed dose and voxel
   surface absorbed dose distributions, average organ and tissue doses and
   a maximum surface absorbed dose for zero depth.}},

Abstract = {{We reformulate the midpoint Lie algorithm, which is implicit in the
   torque calculation, to achieve explicitness in the torque evaluation.
   This is effected by approximating the impulse imparted over the time
   step with discrete impulses delivered at either the beginning of the
   time step or at the end of the time step. Thus, we obtain two related
   variants, both of which are explicit in the torque calculation, but only
   first order in the time step. Both variants are momentum conserving and
   both are symplectic. Consequently, drawing on the properties of the
   composition of maps, we introduce another algorithm that combines the
   two variants in a single time step. The resulting algorithm is explicit,
   momentum conserving, symplectic, and second order. Its accuracy is
   outstanding and consistently outperforms currently known implicit and
   explicit integrators. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To evaluate the value of CT-guided core-needle biopsy in diagnosis
   and classification of malignant lymphomas.
   METHODS: From January 1999 to October 2004, CT-guided core-needle
   biopsies were performed in 80 patients with suspected malignant
   lymphoma. Biopsies were performed with an 18-20 G biopsy-cut (CR Bard,
   Inc., Covington, GA, USA) needle driven by a spring-loaded Bard biopsy
   gun.
   RESULTS: A definite diagnosis and accurate histological subtype were
   obtained in 61 patients with a success rate of 76.25\% (61/80). Surgical
   sampling was performed in 19 patients (23.75\%) with non-diagnostic
   core-needle biopsies. The success rate of CT- guided core-needle biopsy
   varied with the histopathologic subtypes in our group. The relatively
   high success rates of core-needle biopsy were noted in diffuse large
   B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, 88.89\%) and peripheral T-cell NHL
   (90\%). However, the success rates were relatively low in anaplastic
   large cell (T/null cell) lymphoma (ALCL, 44.44\%) and Hodgkin's disease
   (HD, 28.57\%) in our group.
   CONCLUSION: CT- guided core-needle biopsy is a reliable means of
   diagnosing and classifying malignant lymphomas, and can be widely
   applied in the management of patients with suspected malignant lymphoma.

Abstract = {{AIM: To demonstrate the prevalence of sonographic fatty liver,
   overweight and ischemic heart disease (IHD) among the male workers in
   Taiwan, and to investigate the possible association of these three
   factors.
   METHODS: From July to September 2003, a total of 2 088 male
   aircraft-maintenance workers aged from 22 to 65 years (mean 40.5)
   underwent an annual health examination, including anthropometrical
   evaluation, blood pressure measurement, personal medical history
   assessment, biochemical blood analysis, abdominal ultrasonographic
   examination and digital electrocardiography ( ECG). The Student's
   t-test,chi(2) test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were
   utilized to evaluate the relationship between IHD and salient risk
   factors.
   RESULTS: The all-over prevalence of overweight was 41.4\%, and that of
   fatty liver was 29.5\% ( mild, moderate and severe fatty liver being
   14.5\%, 11.3\%, and 3.7\%, respectively); while the prevalence of
   ischemic changes on ECG was 17.1\% in this study. The abnormal rates for
   conventional IHD risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia,
   hyperglycemia and overweight increased in accordance with the severity
   of fatty liver. Overweight and severity of fatty liver were
   independently associated with increased risks for developing IHD.
   Overweight subjects had a 1.32-fold (95\%CI: 1.01-1.73) increased IHD
   risk. Participants with mild, moderate, and severe fatty liver had a
   1.88-fold (95\%CI: 1.37-2.6), 2.37-fold (95\%CI: 1.66-3.37) and
   2.76-fold (95\%CI: 1.62-4.72) increased risk for developing IHD. The
   prevalence of ischemic ECG for the fatty liver-affected subjects with or
   without overweight was 30.1\% and 19.1\%, while that of overweight
   subjects free from fatty liver was 14.4\%. Compared to the subjects
   without fatty liver nor overweight, IHD risk for the three subgroups
   above was as follows: OR: 2.95 (95\%CI: 2.31-4.09), OR: 1.60 (95\%CI:
   1.07-2.39) and OR: 1.11 (95\%CI: 0.78-1.56, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: The presence of fatty liver and its severity should be
   carefully considered as independent risk factors for IHD. Results of the
   study suggest the synergistic effect between fatty liver and overweight
   for developing IHD. Abdominal sonographic examination may provide
   valuable information for IHD risk assessment in addition to limited
   report about liver status, especially for overweight males. (c) 2005 The

Abstract = {{We herein report a gossypiboma resulting from a retained surgical swab,
   which had been left in peritoneum for 20 years after appendectomy. CT
   revealed a cystic mass with a calcified reticulate rind. Subsequent
   surgery and pathological examination showed a gossypiboma. A simple
   experiment, using a barium-soaked surgical swab demonstrating similar CT
   appearance, supported our postulation that calcium deposition on the
   reticulated fibers of a surgical swab could generate such a
   characteristic ``calcified reticulate rind{''} sign. We believe that
   identification of this CT sign facilitates the diagnosis of
   gossypibomas. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of adenosine and subtype-specific activators of adenosine
   receptors (A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3)) were studied on the release of
   interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) from peripheral mononuclear cells,
   monocytes and lymphocytes. In the cells activated by the protein kinase
   C specific phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) and Ca2+
   ionophore (A23187) both adenosine and the subtype-specific receptor
   agonists, CPA (A(1)), CGS 21680 (A(2A)) and IB-MECA (A(3)) induced a
   concentration-dependent inhibition of IL-1 beta release. The rank order
   of potency in the inhibition of IL-1 beta release was CPA = CGS 21680 >
   IB-MECA > adenosine > NECA (in the presence of A(1), A(2A) and A(3)
   receptor inhibitors). The inhibitory actions of CPA, CGS 21680 or

Abstract = {{Since registration started in the 1950s, the incidence of testicular
   cancer (TC) in the Western world has increased, which is also the case
   in Norway. Men born in Norway during World War II (WWII), however, have
   a lower TC incidence than men born in the years before or after WWII.
   Increased fetal exposure to estrogen during the first trimester of
   pregnancy has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of TC
   later in life. Increased maternal weight is associated with higher
   insulin levels, leading to lower sex hormone-binding globulin levels and
   thereby increased levels of bioavailable estrogens for transplacental
   transfer from mother to fetus. The aim of the present study was
   therefore to examine whether there was an association between maternal
   weight and the incidence of TC among those who were born in a time
   period where the nutritional conditions changed, i.e., around the time
   of WWII. We compared data for a random sample of women giving birth in
   Oslo, Norway, in the years 1931 to 1955 with the TC incidence among men
   born in the whole country in the same time period. Maternal weight at
   delivery was used as a proxy for first-trimester weight. We found a
   correlation (Spearman's rho = 1.00, p < 0.01; Pearson's r = 0.95, p =
   0.02) between the TC incidence and maternal weight adjusted for birth
   weight and maternal age. Although one cannot draw firm conclusions from
   ecologic correlations, these findings suggest that the increase in TC
   incidence over the past decades could be at least partly attributed to
   the increased maternal body weight observed in most populations in the
   relevant time period since TC is thought to be associated with in utero
   conditions. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   from the vast majority of lakes with surface area greater than 500
   km(2). Results from the Amazon Basin also show the great improvement in
   both quantity and quality of data obtained. These results graphically

Abstract = {{We have made observations with the Keck I telescope and HIRES at a
   resolution of similar to 45,000 offive nearly identical stars at the
   turnoff of the metal-rich globular cluster M71. We derive stellar
   parameters and abundances of several elements. Our mean Fe abundance,
   {[}Fe/H] = -0.80 +/- 0.02, is in excellent agreement with previous
   cluster determinations from both giants and near-turnoff stars. There is
   no clear evidence for any star-to-star abundance differences or
   correlations in our sample. Abundance ratios of the Fe peak elements
   (Cr, Ni) are similar to Fe. The turnoff stars in M71 have remarkably
   consistent enhancements of 0.2-0.3 dex in {[}Si/Fe], {[}Ca/Fe], and
   {[}Ti/ Fe], like the red giants. Our {[}Mg/Fe] ratio is somewhat lower
   than that suggested by other studies. We compare our mean abundances for
   the five M71 stars with field stars of similar metallicity {[}Fe/H]:
   eight with halo kinematics and 17 with disk kinematics. The abundances
   of the alpha-fusion products (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) agree with both samples
   but seem a closer match to the disk stars. The Mg abundance in M71 is at
   the lower edge of the disk and halo samples. The neutron-capture
   elements, Y and Ba, are enhanced relative to solar in the M71 turnoff
   stars. Our ratio {[}Ba/Fe] is similar to that of the halo field stars
   but a factor of 2 above that for the disk field stars. The important
   {[}Ba/Y] ratio is significantly lower than M71 giant values; the
   precluster material may have been exposed to a higher neutron flux than
   the disk stars or self-enrichment has occurred subsequent to cluster
   star formation. The Na content of the M71 turnoff stars is remarkably
   similar to that in the disk field stars but more than a factor of 2
   higher than the halo field star sample. We find {[}Na/Fe] = +0.14 +/-
   0.04 with a spread less than half of that found in the red giants in
   M71. Excluding Mg, the lack of intracluster alpha-element variations
   (turnoff vis-a-vis giants) suggests that the polluting material needed
   to explain the abundance patterns in M71 did not arise from explosive
   nucleosynthesis but in a more traditional s-process environment such as
   AGB stars. The determination of light s-peak abundances should reveal
   whether this pollution occurred before or after cluster formation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To evaluate the long-term effects on survival and recurrence
   rates of preoperative radiotherapy in the treatment of curatively
   operated rectal cancer patients.
   Patients and Methods Of 1, 168 randomly assigned patients in the Swedish
   Rectal Cancer Trial between 1987 and 1990, 908 had curative surgery; 454
   of these patients had surgery alone, and 454 were administered
   preoperative radiotherapy (25 Gy in 5 days) followed by surgery within I
   week. Follow-up was performed by matching against three Swedish
   nationwide registries (the Swedish Cancer Register, the Hospital
   Discharge Register, and the Cause of Death Register).
   Results Median follow-up time was 13 years (range, 3 to 15 years). The
   overall survival rate in the irradiated group was 38\% v30\% in the
   nonirradiated group (P =.008). The cancer-specific survival rate in the
   irradiated group was 72\% v62\% in the nonirradiated group (P=.03), and
   the local recurrence rate was 9\% v26\% (P <.001), respectively. The
   reduction of local recurrence rates was observed at all tumor heights,
   although it was not statistically significant for tumors greater than 10
   cm from the anal verge.
   Conclusion Preoperative radiotherapy with 25 Gy in 1 week before
   curative surgery for rectal cancer is beneficial for overall and
   cancer-specific survival and local recurrence rates after long-term
   follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose High rates of mastectomy and marked regional variations have
   motivated lingering concerns about overtreatment and failure to involve
   women in treatment decisions. We examined the relationship between
   patient involvement in decision making and type of surgical treatment
   for women with breast cancer.
   Methods All women with ductal carcinoma-in-situ and a 20\% random sample
   of women with invasive breast cancer aged 79 years and younger who were
   diagnosed in 2002 and reported to the Detroit and Los Angeles
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries were identified
   and surveyed shortly after receipt of surgical treatment (response rate,
   77.4\%; In = 1,844).
   Results Mean age was 60.1 years; 70.2\% of the women were white, 18.0\%
   were African American, and 11.8\% were from other ethnic groups.
   Overall, 30.2\% of women received mastectomy as initial treatment. Most
   women reported that they made the surgical decision (41.0\%) or that the
   decision was shared (37.1\%); 21.9\% of patients reported that their
   surgeon made the decision with or without their input. Among white
   women, only 5.3\% of patients whose surgeon made the decision received
   mastectomy compared with 16.8\% of women who shared the decision and
   27.0\% of women who made the decision (P <.001, adjusted for clinical
   factors, predisposing factors, and number of surgeons visited). However,
   this association was not observed for African American women (Wald test
   10.0, P =.041).
   Conclusion Most women reported that they made or shared the decision
   about surgical treatment. More patient involvement in decision making
   was associated with greater use of mastectomy. Racial differences in the
   association of involvement with receipt of treatment suggest that the
   decision-making process varies by racial groups.}},

Abstract = {{Granular cell proliferation in the adult hippocampus decreases during
   aging and after chronic stress, while it can be increased by physical
   activity or treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine. We
   investigated whether the physical and cognitive stimulation accompanied
   by stress in the commonly used Morris water maze affects the rate of
   proliferation and whether the induced changes can be influenced by
   antidepressant treatment with fluoxetine. Proliferating cells in the
   dentate gyrus were labeled by three injections of BrdU during the 24 It
   preceding sacrifice. Early differentiation to neuronal progeny was
   studied by immunohistochemical staining for doublecortin (DCX), a
   microtubule binding protein expressed in newborn neurons. Acquisition
   learning in the water maze for 15 days caused a significant decrease in
   granular cell proliferation in the granular cell layer of the
   hippocampus. The decrease in the number of BrdU- and DCX-positive cells
   was reversed to control levels by the use of fluoxetine during the water
   maze training. Fluoxetine treatment alone increased the number of
   BrdU-positive cells, but did not increase the number of DCX-positive
   cells. We conclude that the exposure of adult male rats to water maze
   acquisition trials is a stressful experience that significantly
   suppresses the production of new granular cells and that this stressful
   effect can be blocked by the concomitant administration of the
   antidepressant fluoxetine. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of this study was to identify factors predicting initial
   and late resistance of GI stromal tumor (GIST) patients to imatinib and
   to document the dose-response relationship in the prognostic subgroups.
   This study is based on the European Organisation for Research and
   Treatment of Cancer-Italian Sarcoma Group-Australasian Gastrointestinal
   Trials Group randomized trial comparing two doses of imatinib in
   advanced disease.
   Patients and Methods Initial resistance was defined as progression
   within 3 months of randomization, and late resistance was defined as
   progression beyond 3 months. Investigated cofactors include imatinib
   dose, age, sex, performance status, original disease site, site and size
   of lesions at trial entry, and baseline hematologic and biologic
   parameters.
   Results Initial resistance was recorded for 116 (12\%) of 934 assessable
   patients and was independently predicted by the presence of lung and
   absence of liver metastases, low hemoglobin level, and high granulocyte
   count. Among 818 patients who were alive and progression free at 3
   months, 347 subsequent progressions were recorded, and late resistance
   was independently predicted by high baseline granulocyte count, primary
   tumor outside of the stomach, large tumor size, and low initial imatinib
   dose. The impact of initial dose on late resistance was mainly
   significant in patients with a high baseline granulocyte count (>
   5.10(9)/L) and in patients with tumors of GI origin outside of the
   stomach and small intestine.
   Conclusion Our study identifies patients for whom initial and/or
   long-term treatment needs to be improved and patients who require a high
   initial dose. Correlation of these results with immunohistochemistry and
   molecular parameters may further help to understand the biologic
   mechanisms of resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleotide activation of P2 receptors is important in autocrine and
   paracrine regulation in many tissues. In the epidermis, nucleotides are
   involved in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this
   study, we have used a combination of luciferin-luciferase luminometry,
   pharmacological inhibitors, and confocal microscopy to demonstrate that
   HaCaT keratinocytes release ATP into the culture medium, and that there
   are three mechanisms for nucleotide interconversion, resulting in ATP
   generation at the cell surface. Addition of ADP, GTP, or UTP to culture
   medium elevated the ATP concentration. ADP to ATP conversion was
   inhibited by diadenosine pentaphosphate, oligomycin, and UDP, suggesting
   the involvement of cell surface adenylate kinase, F1F0 ATP synthase, and
   nucleoside diphosphokinase (NDPK), respectively, which was supported by
   immunohistochemistry. Simultaneous addition of ADP and GTP elevated ATP
   above that for each nucleotide alone indicating that GTP acts as a
   phosphate donor. However, the activity of NDPK, F1F0 ATP synthase or the
   forward reaction of adenylate kinase could not fully account for the
   culture medium ATP content. We postulate that this discrepancy is due to
   the reverse reaction of adenylate kinase utilizing AMP. In normal human
   skin, F1F0 ATP synthase and NDPK were differentially localized, with
   mitochondrial expression in the basal layer, and cell surface expression
   in the differentiated layers. We and others have previously demonstrated
   that keratinocytes express multiple P2 receptors. In this study we now
   identify the potential sources of extracellular ATP required to activate
   these receptors and provide better understanding of the role of
   nucleotides in normal epidermal homeostasis and wound healing.}},

Abstract = {{Most bacteria possess two type IIA topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topo
   IV, that together help manage chromosome integrity and topology. Gyrase
   primarily introduces negative supercoils into DNA, an activity mediated
   by the C-terminal domain of its DNA binding subunit (GyrA). Although
   closely related to gyrase, topo IV preferentially decatenates DNA and
   relaxes positive supercoils. Here we report the structure of the
   full-length Escherichia coli ParC dimer at 3.0 A resolution. The
   N-terminal DNA binding region of ParC is highly similar to that of GyrA,
   but the ParC dimer adopts a markedly different conformation. The
   C-terminal domain (CTD) of ParC is revealed to be a degenerate form of
   the homologous GyrA CTD, and is anchored to the top of the N-terminal
   domains in a configuration different from that thought to occur in
   gyrase. Biochemical assays show that the ParC CTD controls the substrate
   specificity of topo IV, likely by capturing DNA segments of certain
   crossover geometries. This work delineates strong mechanistic parallels
   between topo IV and gyrase, while explaining how structural differences
   between the two enzyme families have led to distinct activity profiles.
   These findings in turn explain how the structures and functions of
   bacterial type IIA topoisomerases have evolved to meet specific needs of
   different bacterial families for the control of chromosome
   superstructure. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the crucial role of surfactant head-group size in micellar
   enzymology, the activity of Chromobacterium Viscosum (CV) lipase was
   estimated in cationic water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsions of three
   different series of surfactants with varied head-group size and
   hydrophilicity. The different series were prepared by subsequent
   replacement of three methyl groups of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
   (CTAB) with hydroxyethyl (1-3, series 1), methoxyethyl (4-6, series 11),
   and n-propyl (7-9, series 111) groups. The hydrophilicity at the polar
   head was gradually reduced from series I to series III. Interestingly,
   the lipase activity was found to be markedly higher for series 11
   surfactants relative to their more hydrophilic analogues in series I.
   Moreover, the activity remained almost comparable for complementary
   analogues of both series I and 111, though the hydrophilicity was
   drastically different. Noticeably, the head-group area per surfactant is
   almost similar for comparable surfactants of both series I and III, but
   distinctly higher in case of series 11 surfactants. Thus the lipase
   activity was largely regulated by the surfactant head-group size, which
   plays the dominant role over the hydrophilicity. The increase in
   head-group size presumably allows the enzyme to attain a flexible
   conformation as well as increase in the local concentration of enzyme
   and substrate, leading to the higher efficiency of lipase. The lipase
   showed its best activity in the microemulsion of 6 probably because of
   its highest head-group size. Furthermore, the observed activity in 6 is
   2-3-fold and 8-fold higher than sodium
   bis(2-ethyl-1-hexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) and CTAB-based microemulsions,
   respectively, and in fact highest ever in any w/o microemulsions.}},

Abstract = {{Eukaryotic DNA polymerase delta ( Pol delta) plays an essential role in
   replicating large nuclear genomes, a process that must be accurate to
   maintain stability over many generations. Based on kinetic studies of
   insertion of individual dNTPs opposite a template guanine, Pol delta is
   believed to have high selectivity for inserting correct nucleotides.
   This high selectivity, in conjunction with an intrinsic 3'-exonuclease
   activity, implies that Pol delta should have high base substitution
   fidelity. Here we demonstrate that the wild type Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae three-subunit Pol delta does indeed have high base
   substitution fidelity for the 12 possible base-base mismatches,
   producing on average less than 1.3 stable misincorporations/ 100,000
   nucleotides polymerized. Measurements with exonuclease-deficient Pol
   delta confirm the high nucleotide selectivity of the polymerase and
   further indicate that proofreading enhances the base substitution
   fidelity of the wild type enzyme by at least 60-fold. However, Pol delta
   inefficiently proofreads single nucleotide deletion mismatches in
   homopolymeric runs, such that the error rate is 30 single nucleotide
   deletions/ 100,000 nucleotides polymerized. Moreover, wild type Pol
   delta frequently deletes larger numbers of nucleotides between distantly
   spaced direct repeats of three or more base pairs. Although wild type
   Pol delta and Pol delta both have high base substitution fidelity, Pol
   delta is much less accurate than Pol epsilon for deletions involving
   repetitive sequences. Thus, strand slippage during replication by wild
   type Pol delta may be a primary source of insertion and deletion
   mutagenesis in eukaryotic genomes.}},

Abstract = {{Anandamide (AEA) uptake has been described over the last decade to occur
   by facilitated diffusion, but a protein has yet to be isolated. In some
   cell types, it has recently been suggested that AEA, an uncharged
   hydrophobic molecule, passively diffuses through the plasma membrane in
   a process that is not proteinmediated. Since that observation, recent
   kinetics studies (using varying assay conditions) have both supported
   and denied the presence of an AEA transporter. In this review, we
   analyze the current literature exploring the mechanism of AEA uptake and
   endeavor to explain the reasons for the divergent views. One of the main
   variables among laboratories is the incubation time of the cells with
   AEA. Initial kinetics (at time points < 1 min depending upon the cell
   type) isolate events that occur at the plasma membrane and are most
   useful to study saturability of uptake and effects of purported
   transport inhibitors upon uptake. Results with longer incubation times
   reflect events not only at the plasma membrane but also interactions at
   intracellular sites that may include enzyme(s), other proteins, or
   specialized lipid-binding domains. Furthermore, at long incubation
   times, antagonists to A-EA receptors reduce AEA uptake. Another
   complicating factor in AEA transport studies is the nonspecific binding
   to plastic culture dishes. The magnitude of this effect may exceed AEA
   uptake into cells. Likewise, AEA may be released from plastic culture
   dishes (without cells) in such a manner as to mimic efflux from cells.
   AEA transport protocols using BSA, similar to the method used for fatty
   acid uptake studies, are gaining acceptance. This may improve AEA
   solution stability and minimize binding to plastic, although some groups
   report that BSA interferes with uptake. In response to criticisms that
   many transport inhibitors also inhibit the fatty acid amide hydrolase
   (FAAH), new compounds have recently been synthesized. Following their
   characterization in FAAH(+/+) and FAAH(-/-) cells and transgenic mice,
   several inhibitors have been shown to have physiological activity in
   FAAH(-/-) mice. Their targets are now being characterized with the
   possibility that a protein transporter for AEA may be characterized. (c)

Abstract = {{We have discovered a ubiquitin (Ub)-specific cysteine protease encoded
   within the N-terminal 500 residues of the UL36 gene product, the largest
   (3164 aa) tegument protein of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Enzymatic
   activity of this fragment, UL36(USP), is detectable only after cleavage
   of UL36(USP) from full-length UL36 and occurs late during viral
   replication. UL36(USP) bears no homology to known deubiquitinating
   enzymes (DUBs) or Ub binding proteins. Sequence alignment of the large
   tegument proteins across the family Herpesviridae indicates conservation
   of key catalytic residues amongst these viruses. Recombinant UL36(USP)
   exhibits hydrolytic activity toward Ub-AMC and ubiquitinated branched
   peptides in vitro. In addition, recombinant UL36(USP) can cleave polyUb
   chains and appears to be specific for Lys48 linkages. Mutation of the
   active site cysteine residue (Cys(65)) to alanine abolishes this
   enzymatic activity. The lack of homology between UL36(USP) and

Abstract = {{In this study, suitability of fast gas chromatography-massspectrometry
   (GC-MS) on a narrow-bore column with a programmed temperature vaporizer
   for the analysis of pesticide residues in non-fatty food was evaluated.
   The main objectives were ruggedness and stability of chromatographic
   system with regards to co-extractives injected. The chromatographic
   matrix induced response enhancement was found to be strongly dependent
   on the concentration of residues and is reaching up to 700\% compared to
   the pesticides solutions in a neat solvent. However, the responses of
   pesticides in matrix-matched standards at different concentration levels
   do not significantly change during 130 injections. Response
   enhancement/or decrease is influenced by the sample preparation
   technique. External calibration with matrix-matched calibration
   standards should, therefore, provide results with good precision also at
   the concentration level of 0.005 mg kg(-1). Social attention is given to
   the performance of the chromatographic column and retention gap with
   regards to peak widths, peak tailing and different sample preparation
   methods. During approximately 460 matrix sample injections, the
   performance of the analytical column was acceptable. GC-MS set-up with
   0.15 mm. i.d. column can be successfully utilized for the pesticide
   residues analysis. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), the naturally occurring amide of
   ethanolamine and palmitic acid, is an endogenous lipid that modulates
   pain and inflammation. Although the anti-inflammatory effects of PEA
   were first characterized nearly 50 years ago, the identity of the
   receptor mediating these actions has long remained elusive. We recently
   identified the ligand-activated transcription factor, peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), as the receptor
   mediating the anti-inflammatory actions of this lipid amide. Here we
   outline the history of PEA, starting with its initial discovery in the
   1950s, and discuss the pharmacological properties of this compound,
   particularly in regards to its ability to activate PPAR-alpha. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{We study the morphological evolution of strained heteroepitaxial films

   truncated conical for high and low temperature cases, respectively.
   Annealing of films at high temperature leads to the formation of closely
   packed islands as in instability theory. At low temperature, pits form
   via a multistep layer-by-layer nucleation mechanism in contrast to the
   conventional single-step nucleation process. They subsequently develop
   into grooves, which are energetically more favorable.}},

Abstract = {{Certain pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, survive within
   the hostile intracellular environment of a macrophage. To identify host
   factors required for mycobacterial entry and survival within
   macrophages, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference screen in
   Drosophila macrophage-like cells, using Mycobacterium fortuitum. We
   identified factors required for general phagocytosis, as well as those
   needed specifically for mycobacterial infection. One specific factor,
   Peste (Pes), is a CD36 family member required for uptake of
   mycobacteria, but not Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus.
   Moreover, mammalian class B scavenger receptors (SRs) conferred uptake
   of bacteria into nonphagocytic cells, with SR-BI and SR-BII uniquely
   mediating uptake of M. fortuitum, which suggests a conserved role for
   class B SRs in pattern recognition and innate immunity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. The aim of this study was to investigate if there are
   differences in locus of control (LOC), at a societal level, between two
   residential areas in Sweden with substantial differences in sickness
   absence.
   Method. A postal questionnaire was sent to 1500 randomly selected men
   and women aged 20-64 years. Five hundred questionnaires were sent to
   people living in Stromsund (a sparsely populated municipality in
   northern Sweden with high rates of sickness absence) and 1000
   questionnaires to people in the Swedish capital of Stockholm, which has
   a low rate of sickness absence.
   Results and conclusion. A comparison of LOC in the two study areas
   supported our hypothesis to a certain extent, external locus being more
   prominent in Stromsund. When physical and mental health and income were
   considered, however, the differences disappeared. Consequently, this
   study did not support the opinion that differences in sickness absence
   can be explained by LOC at a societal level.}},

   (1-Co), {[}Co(SCN)(2)(bte)] (2-Co), {[}Mn(N-3)(2)(bte)] (3-Mn), and
   {[}Mn(N-3)(2)(bim)] (4-Mn), were synthesized and characterized by
   single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies and their magnetic properties
   were investigated. Complex 1-Co is a triple-bridging chain complex with
   double end-to-end SCN- anions and single gauche-bim spacers as bridges.
   Complexes 2-Co and 3-Mn both contain 1D chains bridged by double
   end-to-end SCN- or N3 anions and these chains are further extended to 2D
   (4,4) layers by the anti-bte spacers. Complex 4-Mn has a topological 3D
   diamond structure constructed through 1D double end-on azide-bridged
   Mn-II chains and extended through the anti-bim spacers. Magnetic
   measurements reveal that 1-Co and 3-Mn remain paramagnetic; the dominant
   magnetic coupling between Con is weak ferromagnetic and that between
   Mull is strong antiferromagnetic. As for 2-Co and 4-Mn, they show
   metamagnetic behavior below T-N = 2.9 and 3.0 K, respectively. Our
   results show that a combination of the short anion bridges (SCN/ N3) and
   flexible bidentate long spacers can be used to construct coordination
   polymers with novel topologies and interesting magnetic properties.}},

   the diet-elevated insulin and VEGF (both p < 0.0 1). There was a
   positive correlation between serum insulin and VEGF (p < 0.05) in SID
   rats. ZDF rats had higher serum glucose, insulin, and VEGF than Zucker
   lean rats (all p < 0.01). Treatment of ZDF rats with PPAR7 agonist
   pioglitazone decreased serum glucose and VEGF (both p < 0.01). There was
   a positive correlation between glucose and VEGF in ZDF rats (1) < 0.05).
   In 3T3-LI adipocytes, G1262570 did not affect insulin-stimulated VEGF

Abstract = {{Ab initio calculations have been performed to examine the photochemical
   behavior of 4-(dimethylamino)benzenzonitrile (DMABN). The conical
   intersection between S-2 and S, (S-2/S-1-CIX), where the internal
   conversion takes place after the main transition Of S-0-S-2 at the
   equilibrium geometry in So, is characterized by a dimethylamino-twisted
   quinoid structure where aromaticity of the benzene ring is lost. The
   optimized geometry of the charge transfer (CT) state in S-1 has a
   feature similar to that of S-2/S-1-CIX but is not energetically
   stabilized so much. Consequently, electronically excited DMABN with CT
   character relaxes into the most stable locally excited (LE) state in S,
   through a recrossing at S-2/S-1-CIX in gas phase or nonpolar solvent. In
   polar solvent, in contrast, the equilibration between LE and CT takes
   place in S, so that the CT state is more stable because of electrostatic
   interaction. The excited states of DMABN derivatives have been also
   examined. On the basis of the present computational results, a new and
   simple guiding principle of the emission properties is proposed, where
   conventional twisted intramolecular CT (TICT) and planar intramolecular
   CT (PICT) models are properly incorporated.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Drug-eluting stents are highly effective in reducing the
   rate of in-stent restenosis. It is not known whether there are
   differences in the effectiveness of currently approved drug-eluting
   stents in the high-risk subgroup of patients with diabetes mellitus.
   Methods: We enrolled 250 patients with diabetes and coronary artery
   disease: 125 were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel-eluting
   stents, and 125 to receive sirolimus-eluting stents. The primary end
   point was in-segment late luminal loss. Secondary end points were
   angiographic restenosis (defined as in-segment stenosis of at least 50
   percent at follow-up angiography) and the need for revascularization of
   the target lesion during a nine-month follow-up period. The study was
   designed to show noninferiority of the paclitaxel stent as compared with
   the sirolimus stent, defined as a difference in the extent of in-segment
   late luminal loss of no more than 0.16 mm.
   Results: The extent of in-segment late luminal loss was 0.24 mm (95
   percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.39) greater in the
   paclitaxel-stent group than in the sirolimus-stent group (P=0.002).
   In-segment restenosis was identified on follow-up angiography in 16.5
   percent of the patients in the paclitaxel-stent group and 6.9 percent of
   the patients in the sirolimus-stent group (P=0.03). Target-lesion
   revascularization was performed in 12.0 percent of the patients in the
   paclitaxel-stent group and 6.4 percent of the patients in the
   sirolimus-stent group (P=0.13).
   Conclusions: In patients with diabetes mellitus and coronary artery
   disease, use of the sirolimus-eluting stent is associated with a
   decrease in the extent of late luminal loss, as compared with use of the
   paclitaxel-eluting stent, suggesting a reduced risk of restenosis.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission over channels that produce intersymbol interference is
   considered. New equalisation schemes derived from recently proposed
   lattice-reduction-aided equalisation of multiple-input/multiple-output
   channels are presented. The schemes exhibit low complexity, require no

   channel coding can be immediately applied. The connection to
   partial-response signalling and state-of-the-art equalisation schemes is
   explained. Numerical simulations show good performance of the

Abstract = {{The PML gene of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) encodes a cell-growth
   and tumor suppressor. PML localizes to discrete nuclear bodies (NBs)
   that are disrupted in APL cells, resulting from a reciprocal chromosome
   translocation t (15;17). Here we show that the nuclear localization of
   PML is also regulated by SUMO-3, one of the three recently identified
   SUMO isoforms in human cells. SUMO-3 bears similar subcellular
   distribution to those of SUMO-1 and -2 in the interphase nuclear body,
   which is colocalized with PML protein. However, both SUMO-2 and -3 are
   also localized to nucleoli, a region lacking SUMO-1. Immunoprecipitated
   PML protein bears SUMO-3 moiety in a covalently modified form,
   supporting the notion that PML is conjugated by SUMO-3. To determine the
   functional relevance of SUMO-3 conjugation on PML molecular dynamics, we
   suppressed SUMO-3 protein expression using a siRNA-mediated approach.
   Depletion of SUMO-3 markedly reduced the number of PML-containing NBa
   and their integrity, which is rescued by exogenous expression of SUMO-3
   but not SUMO-1 or SUMO-2. The specific requirement of SUMO-3 for PML
   nuclear localization is validated by expression of SUMO-3 conjugation
   defective mutant. Moreover, we demonstrate that oligomerization of
   SUMO-3 is required for PML retention in the nucleus. Taken together, our
   studies provide first line of evidence showing that SUMO-3 is essential
   for PML localization and offer novel insight into the pathobiochemistry
   of APL.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, the kinetics for synthesizing 4-acetylphenyl benzoate
   ((RCOOR)-C-{*}) from benzoylation of sodium 4-acetylphenoxide via
   third-liquid phase-transfer catalysis was investigated. The reaction
   rate was observed to be strongly dependent on agitation speeds in the
   third-phase catalytic reaction. By forming the third-liquid phase, the
   observed reaction can be greatly enhanced to give a product yield of 100
   \% in a duration of 3 min at 20 degrees C and 200 rpm. If a third-liquid
   phase was not formed in the liquid-liquid system, the reaction rate is
   very slow and the product yield is only 2 \% in 3 min at 20 degrees C.
   The reaction conducted in third-liquid phase-transfer catalytic system
   is faster than that in LLPTC system by 25-28 times. The amount of
   catalytic intermediate (QOR) in the third-liquid phase was about 50 \%
   of the catalyst initially added and kept about 30 \% of it remained
   after 1 min, and only small amounts of a catalytic intermediate residing
   in the organic phase were observed during the reaction using methyl
   t-butyl ether as the solvent. The concentration of catalytic
   intermediate slightly decreased with increasing reaction time, while the
   molar ratio of QOR to benzyl tri-n-butylammonium cation in the
   third-liquid phase remained almost constant after I min and increased
   with increasing agitation speeds. The experimental results were well
   described by the pseudo-first-order kinetics. The present work shows an
   effective method to synthesize 4-acetylphenyl benzoate. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{A method for predicting the location of a dissociation condition on an
   H-L-w-V line under isochoric operation was presented. To establish the
   method, the governing equations for the H-L-w-V coexistence under
   isochoric conditions were derived. Here, a liquid and a vapor phase were
   expressed by the PR EOS + MHV2 model and a hydrate phase by the van der
   Waals-Platteeuw model. The molar volume of the vapor phase was
   calculated from the equation of state, and a simple expression for the
   molar volume of the hydrate phase was derived. Then, to prove the
   validity of the proposed method, experimental studies about the
   dissociation process of the hydrates were performed. The temperature and
   pressure traces in the hydrate dissociation process, including the
   location of the dissociation condition, were successfully predicted by
   the proposed method. In addition, the thermodynamic consistency among
   the phase models was discussed. It was pointed out that agreement
   between the calculated and experimental results about the H-L-w-V
   equilibrium line did not ensure thermodynamic consistency among the
   phase models. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Comparison of prehospital
   tirofiban versus fibrinolysis before direct PCI}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},

Month = {{AUG 18}},
Abstract = {{Aims: Early start of treatment including coronary revascularization has
   been recognized as crucial variable in the outcome of acute ST-segment
   elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The lack of availability and
   the realisation that an optimum reperfusion strategy will need to
   incorporate mechanical reperfusion as part of that strategy has led to a
   great deal of interest in pharmacologic reperfusion combined with
   mechanical reperfusion or facilitated PCI. It is not clear whether
   GPIIb/IIIa-blockade or fibrinolysis better facilitates PCI.
   Methods: We identified 138 patients who have been primarily treated by
   our mobile ernergency care mobile from July 2001 until February 2003
   with tirofiban or fibrinolysis. Seventy-nine patients had ST-elevation
   myocardial infarction (STEMI) and available angiograms within 24 h.
   Results: Forty-four patients had tirofiban (TIRO; 60.6 S.D. 11.4 years,
   64\% male) and 35 patients underwent fibrinolysis (FIB; 31.4\%
   tenecteplase, 54.3\% reteplase, 11.4\% alteplase, 2.9\% streptokinase;
   58.8 S.D. 12.2 years, 80\% male). Data were analyzed with respect to
   TIMI-flow and corrected frame count (cTFC) before and after PCI,
   bleeding complications at 30 days and long-term follow up for major
   adverse events (median 288 days; MACE: Death, hospitalized
   re-infarction, intracranial hemorrhage). Catheter films were re-analyzed
   by an investigator blinded to the prehospital therapy. Time from onset
   of symptoms to first medical contact was 1.98 h in TIRO compared to 0.5
   h in FIB (p < 0.001) and time from first prehospital medical contact to
   catheter was 1.46 h in the TIRO compared to 2.85 h in the FIB group (p <
   0.001). TIMI 3-flow before PCI was observed in 20.5\% of TIRO and 62.9\%
   in FIB (p < 0.001). After PCI TIMI 3-flow was achieved in 90.5\% and
   90.0\%, respectively (p=n.s.) Final cTFC was 24 in TIRO and 29 in FIB
   (p=n.s.). Visible thrombi were detected in 30.2\% in TIRO and 23.5\% in
   FIB (p=n.s.). Major bleeding occurred in one TIRO patient (fatal lung
   bleeding after ultima ratio abciximab on top of tirofiban), 2 patients
   (4.5\%) received transfusions. In FIB 2 intracerebral hemorrhages, 5
   transfusions (14.3\%) and 3 pulmonary bleedings during mandatory
   ventilation were observed. After 30 days 4.5\% in TIRO and 22.9\% in FIB
   had MACE (p=0.015). During long-term follow up the primary endpoint was
   observed in 4.5\% of TIRO and 28.6\% (p=0.003) of FIB. Two patients died
   in TIRO and 9 patients in FIB.
   Conclusions: We conclude that (1) prehospital start of tirofiban for
   facilitated PCI is safe and effective if administered by experienced
   emergency physicians; (2) routine fibrinolysis should be limited to
   areas where catheter based therapy is not available within 90 min and
   (3) fibrinolysis should be given for facilitated PCI in randomized
   trials only at the moment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{On-board generation of hydrogen by methanol reforming is an efficient
   and practical option to fuel PEMFC especially for vehicle propulsion
   purpose. The methanol reforming can take place at temperatures around
   200 degrees C with a nearly 100\% conversion at a hydrogen yield of
   about 400 L (h kg catalyst)(-1). The CO content in the reformate gas at
   this temperature is less than 0.2 vol.\%. The recently developed high
   temperature PEMFC based on acid-doped PB1 membranes can operate in the
   same temperature range and tolerate a few percent of CO in the feeding
   gas. The high CO tolerance makes it possible to use the reformate gas
   directly from the reformer without further CO removal. Integration of
   high temperature PEMFC with a reformer is expected to improve the system
   efficiency and simplify the system construction and operation. The
   present work has demonstrated this possibility. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{It is known that radiation activates the phosphoinositol-3 kinase
   (PI3K)/Akt pathway and that inhibition of PI3K or Akt sensitizes tumor
   vasculature to radiotherapy. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a
   downstream target of Akt, and we hypothesized that irradiation activates
   mTOR signaling in both glioma and endothelial cells (ECs) and that
   radiosensitization results from inhibiting mTOR signaling. mTOR
   inhibitors, rapamycin and RAD001 (everolimus) were found to
   radiosensitize vascular ECs, but failed to sensitize glioma cells as
   determined by clonogenic assay. Therefore, we investigated the
   anti-angiogenic effects of mTOR inhibitors. Increased phospho-mTOR
   protein was detected in irradiated human umbilical vein endothelial
   cells (HUVEC), but not in GL261 glioma cells. Phospho-S6, a biomarker
   for mTOR signaling, was also found to be induced following irradiation
   in HUVEC and this effect was inhibited by PI3K or mTOR inhibitors.
   Significant increase in cleaved caspase 3 was detected when Rad001 was
   combined with radiation. Endothelial tube formation was significantly
   diminished following treatment with rapamycin and 3 Gy of radiation.
   Histological sections of GL261 tumors from mice showed a greatly reduced
   vascular density when treated with RAD001 and radiation. Power Weighted
   Doppler of glioma xenografts in mice showed a significant reduction in
   vasculature and blood flow compared with mice treated with 3 Gy or
   RAD001 alone. We conclude that irradiation activates mTOR signaling in
   vascular endothetium and that rapamycin and RAD001 increased apoptosis
   of ECs in response to radiation. To the authors' best knowledge this is
   the first study which demonstrates that mTOR inhibitors may be a way to
   target the vasculature by radiosensitizing the vascular endothelium
   resulting in better tumor control as seen in experiments demonstrating
   increased tumor growth delay in mice treated with rapamycin with
   radiation compared with mice treat with either treatment alone. We
   conclude that mTOR inhibitors have increased efficacy as antiangiogenics
   when combined with radiation.}},

Abstract = {{A model representing the global average ionosphere and thermosphere (
   GAIT) is developed as a tool to explore the response of the coupled
   system to changes in the input solar irradiance between 3 and 360 nm.
   The GAIT model self- consistently solves the coupled continuity,
   momentum, and energy equations for the three major neutral species, N-2,
   O-2, and O, as well as minor neutral constituents important to the
   global energy budget. In the ionosphere the model includes five
   different ion species and two excited states of O+. The GAIT model also
   includes an approximate treatment of photoelectrons, in order to
   calculate secondary ionization and thermal electron volume heating
   rates. After examining the sensitivity of the GAIT model to
   uncertainties in key reaction rates and inputs, we consider its response
   to four different extreme ultraviolet irradiance models. With three of
   the irradiance models we reproduce the expected variation in exospheric
   temperature to within 2\%; however, the dynamic range of the fourth is
   deemed to be too small. We conclude with an analysis of the model's
   wavelength- dependent sensitivity to input solar photons.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, the effect of electrode preparation procedure on
   the structural properties of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and
   consequently on the performance of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs)
   was investigated. Commercial PtRu black anode catalyst and Pt black
   cathode catalyst were characterized by XRD in their initial form and in
   their intermediate and final states after each step involved in
   catalyst-coated membrane electrode preparation procedure by a decal
   transfer method (DTM). XRD results demonstrated that the DTM process has
   a significant effect on the catalyst structural properties, especially
   on the particle size of Pt black cathode catalyst. It is also discussed
   that among all the steps involved in the electrode fabrication
   procedure, catalyst ink preparation and high temperature transfer
   process are key factors affecting the particle size of Pt black
   catalyst. Furthermore, it was found that the maximum power density of
   the single DMFC using a MEA fabricated by the DTM, when air is used as
   oxidant, is more than two times greater than that of the cell using
   conventionally prepared MEA, and more than three times greater when pure
   oxygen is used as oxidant. This could be attributed to the easier mass
   transportation due to the thinner catalyst layer and the better contact
   between the catalyst layer and the electrolyte membrane in the former
   case, even if, according to in situ CO stripping voltammetry results in
   the fuel cell anode environment, the surface composition of PtRu anode
   has been changed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The most commonly used solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode material is a
   two phase nickel and yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) cermet. During
   typical fuel cell operation, this material remains a cermet; however,
   the anode may reoxidize in a commercial SOFC system due to seal leakage,
   fuel supply interruption, or system shutdown. The cyclic reduction and
   oxidation (redox) of nickel will result in large bulk volume changes,
   which may have a significant effect on the integrity of interfaces
   within the fuel cell and thus may cause significant performance
   degradation.
   A baseline of the redox behaviour of an anode-supported SOFC was
   developed using electrochemical testing and electron microscopy. During
   redox tests, the cell's initial performance was characterized and then a
   small amount of air was blown over the anode in order to reoxidize the
   cell. The cell was then reduced and the electrochemical performance was
   remeasured in order to determine the amount of redox degradation. Cell
   performance decreased slightly after each redox cycle, especially for
   redox times greater than 1 hour. The microstructural changes that
   occurred after redox cycling were characterized using scanning and
   transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). Redox cycling
   significantly changed the microstructure of the anode substrate in the
   cell. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins are derived from
   translocations at 11q23 that occur in aggressive subtypes of leukemia.
   As a consequence, MLL is joined to different unrelated proteins to form
   oncogenic transcription factors. Here we demonstrate a direct
   interaction between several nuclear MLL fusion partners and present
   evidence for a role of these proteins in histone binding. In two-hybrid
   studies, ENL interacted with AF4 and AF5q31 as well as with a fragment
   of AF10. A structure-function analysis revealed that the AF4/AF5q31/AF10
   binding domain in ENL coincided with the C-terminus that is essential
   for transformation by MLL-ENL. The ENL/AF4 association was corroborated
   by GST-pulldown experiments and by mutual coprecipitation. Both proteins
   colocalized in vivo in a nuclear speckled pattern. Moreover, AF4 and ENL
   coeluted on sizing columns together with the known ENL binding partner
   Polycomb3, suggesting the presence of a multiprotein complex. The
   overexpression of ENL alone activated a reporter construct and a
   mutational screen indicated the conserved YEATS domain as essential for
   this function. Overlay and pulldown-assays finally showed a specific and
   YEATS domain-dependent association of ENL with histones H3 and H1. In
   summary, our studies support a common role for nuclear MLL fusion
   partners in chromatin biology.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetochore composition and structure are critical for understanding how
   kinetochores of different types perform similar functions in chromosome
   segregation. We used affinity purification to investigate the
   kinetochore composition and assembly in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We
   identified a conserved DASH complex that functions to ensure precise
   chromosome segregation. Unlike DASH in budding yeast that is localized
   onto kinetochores throughout the cell cycle, SpDASH is localized onto
   kinetochores only in mitosis. We also identified two independent groups
   of kinetochore components, one of which, the Sim4 complex, contains
   several novel Fta proteins in addition to known kinetochore components.
   DASH is likely to be associated with the Sim4 complex via Dad1 protein.
   The other group, Ndc80 - MIND - Spc7 complex, contains the conserved
   Ndc80 and MIND complexes and Spc7 protein. We propose that fission yeast
   kinetochore is comprised of at least two major structural motifs that
   are biochemically separable. Our results suggest a high degree of
   conservation between the kinetochores of budding yeast and fission yeast
   even though many individual protein subunits do not have a high degree
   of sequence similarity.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Previous work suggested a double collision suture, including
   ophiolites from two oceanic basins (Valais and Piemont-Liguria), on the
   southern side of Monte Rosa (Penninic Alps, northern Italy). This area
   was studied using field mapping, microstructural analysis, and neutron
   texture goniometry. After its formation and eclogite-facies metamorphism
   of continental and oceanic units, the suture was deformed by four
   successive folding and shearing events under greenschist-facies
   conditions, all of them taking place between 40 and 28 Ma. After fold
   retrodeformation, the following tectonostratigraphy results, from base
   to top: Monte Rosa gneiss ( European margin), Balma
   serpentinite/eclogite unit (Cretaceous crust of Valais ocean),
   Stolemberg gneiss (Iberia-Brianc, onnais continent), Zermatt-Saas and
   Tsate ophiolites (Jurassic crust of Piemont-Ligurian ocean), Sesia nappe
   ( continental fragment off the Adria margin). The preservation of this
   lithological sequence suggests that deep-seated deformation during
   multiple continent collision produces heterogeneous strain and extreme
   thinning of nappes but their original stacking order can still be
   reconstructed using kinematic analysis and overprinting criteria. This
   is due to the ductile nature of the collisional deformation which
   retains the continuity of tectonic contacts.}},

Abstract = {{The factors that are responsible for the relatively low glutathione
   peroxidase (GPx)-like antioxidant activity of organoselenium compounds
   such as ebselen (1,2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one) in the
   reduction of hydroperoxides with aromatic thiols such as benzenethiol
   and 4-methylbenzenethiol as cosubstrates are described. Experimental and
   theoretical investigations reveal that the relatively poor GPx-like
   catalytic activity of organoselenium compounds is due to the undesired
   thiol exchange reactions that take place at the selenium center in the
   selenenyl sulfide intermediate. This study suggests that any substituent
   that is capable of enhancing the nucleophilic attack of thiol at sulfur
   in the selenenyl sulfide state would enhance the antioxidant potency of
   organoselenium compounds such as ebselen. It is proved that the use of
   thiol having an intramolecularly coordinating group would enhance the
   biological activity of ebselen and other organoselenium compounds. The
   presence of strong S center dot center dot center dot N or S center dot
   center dot center dot O interactions in the selenenyl sulfide state can
   modulate the attack of an incoming nucleophile (thiol) at the sulfur
   atom of the -Se-S- bridge and enhance the GPx activity by reducing the
   barrier for the formation of the active species selenol.}},

Abstract = {{Donor-acceptor interactions were investigated in a series of unusually
   rigid, cofacially compressed pi-stacked porphyrin-bridge-quinone
   systems. The two-state generalized Mulliken-Hush (GMH) approach was used
   to compute the coupling matrix elements. The theoretical coupling values
   evaluated with the GMH method were obtained from configuration
   interaction calculations using the INDO/S method. The results of this
   analysis are consistent with the comparatively soft distance dependences
   observed for both the charge separation and charge recombination
   reactions. Theoretical studies of model structures indicate that the
   phenyl units dominate the mediation of the donor-acceptor coupling and
   that the relatively weak exponential decay of rate with distance arises
   from the compression of this pi-electron stack.}},

Abstract = {{Suramin is a competitive inhibitor of heparin binding to many proteins,
   including viral envelope proteins, protein tyrosine phosphatases, and
   fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). It has been clinically evaluated as a
   potential therapeutic in treatment of cancers caused by unregulated
   angiogenesis, triggered by FGFs. Although it has shown clinical promise
   in treatment of several cancers, suramin has many undesirable side
   effects. There is currently no experimental structure that reveals the
   molecular interactions responsible for suramin inhibition of heparin
   binding, which could be of potential use in structure-assisted design of
   improved analogues of suramin. We report the structure of suramin, in
   complex with the heparin-binding site of vaccinia virus complement
   control protein (VCP), which interacts with heparin in a geometrically
   similar manner to many FGFs. The larger than anticipated flexibility of
   suramin manifested in this structure, and other details of VCP-suramin

Abstract = {{Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as paroxetine, are
   utilized in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. Although
   SSRIs potently interfere with the activity of brain serotonin
   transporter (SERT) after acute treatment, clinical improvement of
   psychiatric diseases is observed only after the repeated administration
   for several weeks (2-6 weeks). The present study was undertaken to
   investigate the effects of continuous administration of paroxetine on
   specific {[}H-3]paroxetine binding sites and expression of SERT protein
   in mouse brain. Mice continuously and subcutaneously received paroxetine
   at doses of 2.67 or 13.3 mu mol/kg/day for 21 days by using osmotic
   minipumps, and the steady-state plasma drug levels were within the range
   of reported concentrations in the clinical therapy. Continuous
   administration of paroxetine at theses doses produced significant
   (25-46\%) reduction of {[}3 H]paroxetine binding in each brain region
   (cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, midbrain) of mice. In
   Western blot analysis, expression levels of SERT protein in the thalamus
   and midbrain of mice were significantly (51\% and 61\%, respectively)
   decreased on day 21 after the implantation of minipumps at the higher
   dose. In conclusion, this study has firstly shown that continuous
   administration of paroxetine induces significant reduction of not only
   ligand binding sites of SERT but the protein expression level in mouse
   brain. Such down-regulation of SERT may partly underlie the therapeutic
   effect of long-term treatment with SSRIs in human. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study examined women's opinions about the climacteric
   and hormone therapy (HT) after menopause and compared women's and
   physicians' opinions in a country of low-HT use.
   Methods: In 1998, a postal questionnaire was sent to a random sample of
   2000 Estonian 45-64-year-old women; 69\% (n = 1312) responded. In 1999,
   a postal questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 500 Estonian
   gynaecologists and general practitioners; 68\% (n=342) responded.
   Results: Mean age at menopause was 49.8 years (S.D. 4.0), and there was
   no difference by socioeconomic classes or by age in self-rated health.
   Ten percent of women reported having used HT, with 3\% currently using
   it. Most women reported some symptoms, with vasomotor symptoms more
   frequently reported by 50-54 years old; women most often reported
   tiredness (48\%). Half of the women but under a fifth of physicians
   considered the climacteric a normal phase of life. Women's awareness
   about HT was low and about half had no opinion on its health effects.
   Half of the women had visited a gynaecologist, older women less so.
   Women with contacts with health care were more aware of HT.
   Conclusions: Women reported symptoms by age-group as similarly found in
   high-HT use countries and it verifies that many symptoms experienced
   were not due to menopause. As in other low-HT use countries, women were
   unfamiliar with HT and their attitudes were traditional, although
   physicians' attitudes were more positive. Estonian women seemed to have
   escaped the period of the preventive use of HT. (c) 2004 Elsevier

Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{44}},

Pages = {{10828-10838}},
Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Proteorhodopsin, a retinal protein of marine proteobacteria similar to
   bacteriorhodopsin of the archaea, is a light-driven proton pump.
   Absorption of a light quantum initiates a reaction cycle (turnover time
   of ca. 50 ms), which includes photoisomerization of the retinal from the
   all-trans to the 13-cis form and transient deprotonation of the retinal
   Schiff base, followed by recovery of the initial state. We report here
   that in addition to this fast cyclic conversion, illumination at high pH
   results in accumulation of a long-lived photoproduct absorbing at 362
   nm. This photoconversion is much more efficient in the D227N mutant in
   which the anionic Asp227, which together with Asp97 constitutes the
   Schiff base counterion, is replaced with a neutral residue. Upon
   illumination at pH 8.5, most of the D227N pigment is converted to the
   362 nm species, with a quantum efficiency of ca. 0.2. The pK(a) for this
   transition in the wild type is 9.6, but decreased to 7.5 after mutation
   of Asp227. The short wavelength of the absorption maximum of the
   photoproduct indicates that it has a deprotonated Schiff base. In the
   dark, this photoproduct is converted back to the initial pigment with a
   time constant of 30 min (in D227N, at pH 8.5), but it can be reconverted
   more rapidly by illumination with near-UV light. Experiments with
   ``locked{''} retinal analogues which selectively exclude rotation around
   either the C9=C10, C11=C12, or C13=C14 bond show that formation of the
   362 nm species involves isomerization around the C13=C14 bond. In
   agreement with this, retinal extraction indicates that the 362 nm
   photoproduct is 13-cis whereas the initial state is predominantly
   all-trans. A rapid shift of the pH from 8.5 to 4 greatly accelerates
   thermal reconversion of the 362 nm species to the initial pigment,
   suggesting that its recovery involving the thermal isomerization of the
   chromophore is controlled by ionizable residues, primarily the Schiff
   base and Asp97. The transformation to the long-lived 362 nm photoproduct
   is apparently a side reaction of the photocycle, a response to high pH,
   caused by alteration of the normal reprotonation and reisomerization
   pathway of the Schiff base.}},

   heating of SWNT in vitro. Selective cancer cell destruction can be
   achieved by functionalization of SWNT with a folate moiety, selective
   internalization of SWNTs inside cells labeled with folate receptor tumor
   markers, and NIR-triggered cell death, without harming receptor-free
   normal cells. Thus, the transporting capabilities of carbon nanotubes
   combined with suitable functionalization chemistry and their intrinsic
   optical properties can lead to new classes of novel nanomaterials for
   drug delivery and cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{We report that microinjections of L-glutamate (L-glu) or

   unanesthetized rats caused a hypotensive response. Guide cannulas were
   stereotaxically placed in the LH 3 days before the experiments, under
   tribromoethanol anesthesia. One day before the experiments, the femoral
   artery was cannulated for pulsatile arterial pressure (PAP), mean
   arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) measurements. In the first
   experiment, unanesthetized rats received microinjections of 2.5, 5.0 or
   10.0 nmol/100 nL of L-glu in the LH. Dose-dependent hypotensive
   responses were observed, without significant concomitant changes in
   heart rate. In a second group of experiments, 5.0 nmol. of L-glu was
   microinjected into the LH before and 10 min after pretreatment with
   glutamatergic antagonists. Pretreatments with the non-selective
   ionotropic glutamatergic-receptor antagonist kynurenic acid or the
   selective NMDA receptor antagonists AP-7 and LY235959 significantly
   reduced the hypotensive response to microinjection of L-ghl in the LH.
   Pretreatment with the selective AMPA-receptor antagonist NBQX or with
   vehicle did not affect the hypotensive response. The present results
   suggest that the hypotensive response to the injection of L-ghl into the
   LH is mediated by NMDA receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We utilize a scattering- based seismic tomography technique to constrain
   crustal structure around the southern San Francisco Bay region ( SFBR).
   This technique is based on coupled traveling wave scattering theory,
   which has usually been applied to the interpretation of surface waves in
   large regional- scale studies. Using fully threedimensional kernels,
   this technique is here applied to observed P, S, and surface waves of
   intermediate period ( 3 - 4 s dominant period) observed following eight
   selected regional events. We use a total of 73 seismograms recorded by a
   U. S. Geological Survey short-period seismic array in the western Santa
   Clara Valley, the Berkeley Digital Seismic Network, and the Northern
   California Seismic Network. Modifications of observed waveforms due to
   scattering from crustal structure include ( positive or negative)
   amplification, delay, and generation of coda waves. The derived crustal
   structure explains many of the observed signals which cannot be
   explained with a simple layered structure. There is sufficient
   sensitivity to both deep and shallow crustal structure that even with
   the few sources employed in the present study, we obtain shallow
   velocity structure which is reasonably consistent with previous P wave
   tomography results. We find a depth-dependent lateral velocity contrast
   across the San Andreas fault ( SAF), with higher velocities southwest of
   the SAF in the shallow crust and higher velocities northeast of the SAF
   in the midcrust. The method does not have the resolution to identify
   very slow sediment velocities in the upper approximately 3 km since the
   tomographic models are smooth at a vertical scale of about 5 km.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) or
   hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV (HSAN IV) is a rare
   autosomal recessive disorder featuring recurrent fever episodes,
   inability to sweat, absent response to noxious stimuli, self mutilating
   behavior and mental retardation. It has been associated with mutations
   in the NTRK1 gene, located in lq21-22 and encoding a high-affinity NGF
   receptor. Case report. An 8-year-old boy, the first son of
   consanguineous parents, presented with hypotonia, episodic hyperpyrexia
   and global developmental delay since the neonatal period. In addition to
   these signs, typical of CIPA, he displayed some other not previously
   described in this disease, such as facial dysmorphism, a severe
   swallowing disorder and a myogenic EMG pattern, that led to the initial
   suspicion of a muscle disorder Molecular genetics studies uncovered a
   mutation c.C2011T in exon 15 of the NTRK1 gene. Genetic counselling was
   possible in the following pregnancy of the couple, where the female
   fetus was found to harbour the mutation in heterozygosity. The
   subsequent diagnosis of a congenital myasthenic syndrome in this sister
   led to neurophysiological re-evaluation of the probandus, in whom a
   myasthenic pattern of muscle activation was also found. Conclusions. A
   patient with CIPA and congenital myasthenic syndrome is described. CIPA
   must be the first diagnostic hypothesis when assessing a patient with
   insensitivity to pain, anhidrosis and self-mutilation. Given the rather
   homogeneous presentation of CIPA, the occurrence of atypical myopathic
   manifestations should raise the suspicion of a concurrent disorder: The
   present consanguineous kindred illustrates a rare instance of
   transmission of two mutated alleles giving rise to two unrelated,
   infrequent neurological syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{A method for the measurement of proton T-1 rho relaxation times in
   unlabeled proteins is described using a variable spin-lock pulse after
   the initial nonselective 90 degrees excitation in a HOHAHA pulse
   sequence. The experiment is applied to a-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX) and
   its complex with a 25-residue peptide derived from the acetylcholine
   receptor (AChR) alpha-subunit. A good correlation between high T-1 rho
   values and increased local motion is revealed. In the free form, toxin
   residues associated with receptor binding according to the NMR structure
   of the alpha-BTX complex with an AChR peptide and the model for
   alpha-BTX with the AChR {[}Samson, A. O., et al. (2002) Neuron 35,
   319-332] display high mobility. When the AChR peptide binds, a decrease
   in the relaxation times and the level of motion of residues involved in
   binding of the receptor alpha-subunit is exhibited, while residues
   implicated in binding gamma- and delta-subunits retain their mobility.
   In addition, the quantitative T-1 rho measurements enable us to
   corroborate the mapping of boundaries of the AChR determinant strongly
   interacting with the toxin {[}Samson, A. O., et al. (2001) Biochemistry
   40, 5464-5473] and can similarly be applied to other protein complexes
   in which peptides represent one of the two interacting proteins. The
   presented method is advantageous because of its simplicity, generality,
   and time efficiency and paves the way for future investigation of proton
   relaxation rates in small unlabeled proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by an emergent
   coronavirus (SARS-CoV), for which there is currently no effective
   treatment. SARS-CoV mediates receptor binding and entry by its spike (S)
   glycoprotein, and infection is sensitive to lysosomotropic agents that
   perturb endosomal pH. We demonstrate here that the
   lysosomotropic-agent-mediated block to SARS-CoV infection is overcome by
   protease treatment of target-cell-associated virus. In addition,
   SARS-CoV infection was blocked by specific inhibitors of the
   pH-sensitive endosomal protease cathepsin L. A cell-free membrane-fusion
   system demonstrates that engagement of receptor followed by proteolysis
   is required for SARS-CoV membrane fusion and indicates that cathepsin L
   is sufficient to activate membrane fusion by SARS-CoV S. These results
   suggest that SARS-CoV infection results from a unique, three-step
   process: receptor binding and induced conformational changes in S
   glycoprotein followed by cathepsin L proteolysis within endosomes. The
   requirement for cathepsin L proteolysis identifies a previously
   uncharacterized class of inhibitor for SARS-CoV infection.}},

Abstract = {{Bone-marrow-derived cells can contribute nuclei to skeletal muscle
   fibers. However, serial sectioning of muscle in mdx mice implanted with
   GFP-labeled bone marrow reveals that only 20\% of the donor nuclei
   chronically incorporated in muscle fibers show dystrophin (or GFP)
   expression, which is still higher than the expected frequency of
   ``revertant{''} fibers, but there is no overall increase above controls
   over time. Obviously, the vast majority of incorporated nuclei either
   never or only temporarily turn on myogenic genes; also, incorporated
   nuclei eventually loose the activation of the beta-actin::GFP transgene.
   Consequently, we attempted to enhance the expression of dystrophin. In
   vivo application of the chromatin-modifying agents 5-azadeoxycytidine
   and phenylbutyrate as well as local damage by cardiotoxin injections
   caused a small increase in dystrophin-positive fibers without abolishing
   the appearance of ``silent{''} nuclei. The results thus confirm that
   endogenous repair processes and epigenetic modifications on a
   small-scale lead to dystrophin expression from donor nuclei. Both
   effects, however, remain below functionally significant levels.}},

   ablation of aluminum in vacuum}},

Volume = {{98}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{We used time-gated optical emission spectroscopy to investigate the
   characteristics of aluminum plumes and their vacuum expansion after
   femtosecond laser ablation at different fluences. The prominent feature
   is the presence of two main classes of species in the plume: very fast
   Al atoms and ions preceding the plume bulk essentially constituted of
   much slower Al nanoparticles expanding with a ten times smaller average
   velocity. Atomic force microscopy of deposited Al nanoparticles
   evidenced an average size of about 10 nm with a pretty narrow size
   distribution. These results and the peculiar feature of nanoparticle
   formation during femtosecond laser irradiation of matter were very
   satisfactorily interpreted and reproduced by molecular-dynamics
   simulation of the process. Finally, the analysis of the dependence on
   laser fluence of the ablation process showed an initial logarithmic
   increase of ablation yield, up to about 500 mJ/cm(2), followed by a
   sudden and very steep increase at higher fluences. According to our
   numerical calculations, this latter feature can be ascribed to the
   increase of the overheated material volume due to electron heat
   diffusion. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{A tobacco field in Greece was sampled during the 2001 and 2002 growing
   seasons to assess the seasonal trends in densities and spatial
   distributions of the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and its predatory
   mirid Macrolophus costalis (Fieber). On repeated occasions between June
   Oust after the transplantation) and September Oust before harvest), 20
   tobacco leaves (10 from the upper and 10 from the lower plant part) were
   taken from randomly chosen plants. These leaves were sampled for aphids
   and mirids. In both years, the highest aphid densities were recorded
   during July and August, while aphid numbers were low in September. In
   contrast, the majority of M costalis individuals were found during
   September when aphid numbers were low. Significantly more M persieae
   individuals were found in the upper part of the plants, whereas
   significantly more M costalis individuals were found in the lower part
   of the plants. As indicated by Taylor's Power Law estimates, both
   species were aggregated in their spatial distributions among sampling
   units (leaves). Wilson and Room's model, based on the Taylor's
   estimates, was used to calculate the mean number of aphids and mirids,
   from the proportion of sampling units (leaves) that had > 0 individuals
   of each species. This model provided a satisfactory fit of the data for
   both the aphid and the mirid. In addition, Wilson and Room's model was
   successfully used to predict the mean number of aphids and mirids in a
   series of samples that were carried out in the same area between June
   and September 2003 for model validation. Finally, equations are given
   for the calculation of precision in estimating the mean number of aphids
   or mirids per sampling unit, and the required sample size for a given
   level of precision.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, several studies on grain refinement of ferrite have
   been conducted by different methods (equal channel angular pressing
   (ECAP), high pressure torsion (HPT), accumulative roll bonding (ARB)) in
   order to optimize the relationship between mechanical properties and
   microstructure of steels. The present work deals with the strain-induced
   dynamic transformation of ferrite. Samples of low C-Mn and Nb-Ti
   microalloyed steels were intensively deformed in warm torsion. This
   resulted in the formation of ultrafine ferrite grains (similar to 1 mu
   m) thereby enhancing the mechanical properties compared to the ordinary
   hot rolled products without the necessity of implementing an extremely
   high strain accumulation. The following annealing has resulted in
   recrystallization and growth of ferrite grains accompanied by a
   homogenization of the final microstructure and a decrease in hardness.
   With increase in annealing time the volume fraction of
   martensite/austenite (MA) constituent increased. The results have shown
   that the effect of steel chemistry was insignificant in comparison with
   the effect of thermornechanical processing parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   implications of various environmental regulation and management
   scenarios for both natural water systems and engineered-economic systems

   Specific case study application to water and nitrogen flows in the
   Swedish Norrstrom drainage basin indicates considerable nitrogen load
   contributions to surface and coastal waters from slow groundwater flow
   paths and legacies of accumulated nitrogen in subsurface and immobile
   water pools. This implies that effective nitrogen load abatement cannot

Abstract = {{Upon reaching the mature heat stable antigen (HSA) low thymic
   developmental stage, CD1d-restricted V alpha 14-J alpha 18 thymocytes
   undergo a well-characterized sequence of expansion and differentiation
   steps that lead to the peripheral
   interleukin-4/interferon-gamma-producing NKT phenotype. However, their
   more immature HSA high precursors have remained elusive, and it has been
   difficult to determine unambiguously whether NKT cells originate from a
   CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) stage, and when the CD4(+) and
   CD4(+)CD8(+) double-negative (DN) NKT subsets are formed. Here, we have
   used a CD1d tetramer-based enrichment strategy to physically identify
   HSA high precursors in thymuses of newborn mice, including an elusive DP
   low stage and a CD4(+) stage, which were present at a frequency of
   similar to 10(-6). These HSA high DP and CD4(+) stages appeared to be
   nondividing, and already exhibited the same V beta 8 bias that
   characterizes mature NKT cells. This implied that the massive expansion
   of NKT cells is separated temporally from positive selection, but
   faithfully amplifies the selected TCR repertoire. Furthermore, we found
   that, unlike the DN gamma delta T cells, the DN NKT cells did not
   originate from a pT alpha-independent pathway bypassing the DP stage,
   but instead were produced during a short window of time from the
   conversion of a fraction of HSA(low) NK1.1(neg) CD4 cells. These
   findings identify the HSA(high) CD4(+) stage as a potential branchpoint
   between NKT and conventional T lineages and between the CD4 and DN NKT
   sublineages.}},

Abstract = {{D.c. and a.c. conductivity measurements have been performed on amorphous
   As2Se3 and As2Te3 thin films. As2Se3 and As2Te3 samples were subjected
   to fields of the order of 10(0)-10(3) V/cm and their d.c. conductivities
   were measured at temperatures between 197 and 423 K. The conductivity
   shows an exponential relation with the temperature of type sigma =
   sigma(0)exp(-E/kT). An application of the results to the above relation
   indicates a dominance of extended state conduction. The a.c.
   conductivities of As2Se3 and As2Te3 samples were measured at
   temperatures between 228 and 373 K in the frequency range between 5 Hz
   and 1 MHz. The results suggest that the conductivity consists of two
   components, one being independent of frequency and the other varying as
   omega(s) with frequency. The data are found to fit the correlated
   barrier hopping (CBH) model, especially at low temperatures. The a.c.
   data show a good agreement with the quasi-universal law predicted by the
   extended pair approximation (EPA). Quantitatively, the agreement is less
   good. The wavefunction decay length and the exponent derived from the
   data are not as satisfactory. These discrepancies cast doubt on the
   universality of the EPA. There may be more material dependency than
   expected. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The tanning industry uses large quantities of water and produces a
   correspondingly large amount of wastewater with high levels of salts and
   organic materials. Before these wastewaters can be eliminated, they must
   be submitted to a suitable depuration treatment. However, conventional
   treatments such as those used for urban wastewater are not able to
   reduce the salt content sufficiently and new methods need to be studied
   in the light of new technologies. in this aspect, membrane technology is
   increasingly used as a separation technique in chemical and
   environmental engineering, including desalination, selective separation
   and wastewater treatment. In this paper, we describe a comparative study
   of six different reverse osmosis membranes, which were tested for their
   ability to reduce the salt content in the tertiary treatment after the
   elimination of chromium salts and organic matter of an effluent from a
   pilot plant for treating industrial wastewater from the tanning industry
   to reach the legal levels established for their safe disposal. The
   membranes were checked using a 3x10(-3) m(2) flat cell, where the

Abstract = {{A new asymptotic multiple scale expansion is used to derive envelope
   equations for localized spatially periodic patterns in the context of
   the generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation. An analysis of this envelope
   equation results in parametric conditions for localized patterns.
   Furthermore, it yields corrections for wave number selection which are
   an order of magnitude larger for asymmetric nonlinearities than for the
   symmetric case. The analytical results are compared with numerical
   computations which demonstrate that the condition for localized patterns
   coincides with vanishing Hamiltonian and Lagrangian for periodic
   solutions. One striking feature of the choice of scaling parameters is
   that the derived condition for localized patterns agrees with the
   numerical results for a significant range of parameters which are an
   0(l) distance from the bifurcation, thus providing a novel approach for
   studying these localized patterns. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Accurate measurement of activity of wild-type K-ras protein is important
   due to its tumor suppressor action in tissues such as lung. A published
   method by Taylor and co-workers uses plasmid-containing Escherichia coli
   cells to produce a glutathione-S-transferase/raf-1 ras binding domain
   (GST-RBD) fusion protein attached to glutathione beads to isolate
   activated ras protein. We systematically optimized the method before use
   on lung tissues. Changing the GST-RBD protein induction temperature from
   the original 37 to 30 degrees C produced a consistently greater yield of
   fusion protein. To improve stability of the GST-RBD beads so as to
   perform large-scale experiments, 0.1\% NaN3 was added. NaN3-treated
   beads retained full affinity for at least 24 days. Sensitivity was
   improved by using a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane rather than
   nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. We also compared our GST-RBD beads
   with two commercial assay kits and found that our beads had both
   superior sensitivity and reduced variability. In summary, our
   modification of the GST-RBD affinity method to recover activated K-ras

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Using a modified symbiotic genetic algorithm approach and many-body
   interatomic potential derived from first principles, we have calculated
   equilibrium geometries and binding energies of the ground-state and
   low-lying isomers of Be clusters containing up to 41 atoms.
   Molecular-dynamics study was also carried out to study the frequency of
   occurrence of the various geometrical isomers as these clusters are
   annealed during the simulation process. For a selected group of these
   clusters, higher-energy isomers were more often found than their
   ground-state structures due to large catchment areas. The accuracy of
   the above ground-state geometries and their corresponding binding
   energies were verified by carrying out separate ab initio calculations
   based on molecular-orbital approach and density-functional theory with
   generalized gradient approximation for exchange and correlation. The
   atomic orbitals were represented by a Gaussian 6-311G({*}{*}) basis, and
   the geometry optimization was carried out using the GAUSSIAN 98 code
   without any symmetry constraint. While the ground-state geometries and
   their corresponding binding energies obtained from ab initio
   calculations do not differ much from those obtained using the
   molecular-dynamics approach, the relative stability of the clusters and
   the energy gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied
   molecular orbitals show significant differences. The energy gaps,
   calculated using the density-functional theory, show distinct shell
   closure effects, namely, sharp drops in their values for Be clusters
   containing 2, 8, 20, 34, and 40 electrons. While these features may
   suggest that small Be clusters behave free-electron-like and, hence, are
   metallic, the evolution of the structure, binding energies, coordination
   numbers, and nearest-neighbor distances do not show any sign of
   convergence towards the bulk value. We also conclude that
   molecular-dynamics simulation based on many-body interatomic potentials
   may not always give the correct picture of the evolution of the
   structure and energetics of clusters although they may serve as a useful
   tool for obtaining starting geometries by efficiently searching a large
   part of the phase space.}},

Title = {{Autoimmune hepatitis in India: profile of an uncommon disease}},
Journal = {{BMC GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) has been reported to show
   considerable geographical variation in frequency and clinical
   manifestations. It is considered a rare cause of liver disease in India.
   The present study was undertaken to determine the incidence, clinical,
   biochemical and histological profile of AIH in this part of the world.
   Methods: Patients presenting with acute or chronic liver disease between
   January 1999 and June 2002 were evaluated prospectively. AIH was
   diagnosed using the international autoimmune hepatitis group criteria.
   Workup included clinical, biochemical, USG, viral markers, UGI
   endoscopy, AI markers (ANA, SMA, Anti-LKM, AMA, RF, p-ANCA) using
   indirect immunofluorescence and liver biopsy if possible.
   Results: Forty-one of 2401 (1.70\%) patients were diagnosed to have
   autoimmune liver disease. Out of these, 38 had autoimmune hepatitis and
   the rest 3 had primary biliary cirrhosis. The mean age of the patients
   of autoimmune hepatitis was 36.2 (15.9) years, 34 (89.4\%) were females,
   and the duration of symptoms was 20.3 (20.5) months. Nineteen (50\%) of
   them presented with chronic hepatitis, 13 (34.2\%) as cirrhosis, 5
   (13.1\%) with acute hepatitis and 1 (2.6\%) with cholestatic hepatitis.
   The presentations were jaundice in 21 (55.2\%), pedal edema and
   hepatomegaly in 17 (44.7\%), splenomegaly in 13 ( 34.2\%),
   encephalopathy, abdominal pain in 9 (23.6\%) and fever in 8 (21\%).
   Twelve had esophageal varices and 3 had bled. Biochemical parameters
   were ALT 187 ( 360) U/L, AST 157 ( 193) U/L, ALP 246 ( 254) U/L,
   globulin 4.1 (1.6) g/dL, albumin 2.8 (0.9) g/dL, bilirubin 5.2 (7.4)
   mg/dL, prothrombin time 17 ( 7) sec and ESR 47 ( 17) sec. The autoimmune
   markers were SMA ( 24), ANA ( 15), both SMA and ANA ( 4), AMA ( 1),
   rheumatoid factor ( 2), pANCA ( 1), and Anti-LKM in none. Thirty (79\%)
   patients had definite AIH and eight ( 21\%) had probable AI hepatitis.
   Associated autoimmune diseases was seen in 15/38 (39.4\%), diabetes 4,
   hypothyroidism 3, vitiligo 2, thrombocytopenia 2, rheumatoid arthritis
   2, Sjogren's syndrome 1 and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome III in 1.
   Viral markers were positive in two patients, one presenting as acute
   hepatitis and HEV-IgM positive and another anti-HCV positive.
   Conclusion: In India, autoimmune hepatitis is uncommon and usually
   presents with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, acute hepatitis being less
   common. Age at presentation was earlier but clinical parameters and
   associated autoimmune diseases were similar to that reported from the
   west. Primary biliary cirrhosis is rare. Type II AIH was not observed.}},

Abstract = {{The standard paradigm that the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum (PETM)
   represents a threshold event intrinsic to Earth's climate and connected
   in some way with long-term warming has influenced interpretations of the
   geochemical, climate, and biological perturbations that occurred at this
   event. As recent high-resolution data have demonstrated that the onset
   of the event was geologically instantaneous, attempts to account for the
   event solely through endogenous mechanisms have become increasingly
   strained. The rapid onset of the event indicates that it was triggered
   by a catastrophic event which we suggest was most likely a bolide
   impact. We discuss features of the PETM that require explanation and
   argue that mechanisms that have previously been proposed either cannot
   explain all of these features or would require some sort of high-energy
   trigger. A bolide impact could provide such a trigger and, in the event
   of a comet impact, could contribute directly to the shape of the carbon
   isotope curve. We introduce a carbon cycle model that would explain the
   PETM by global warming following a bolide impact, leading to the
   oxidation of terrestrial organic carbon stores built up during the late
   Paleocene. Our intention is to encourage other researchers to seriously
   consider an impact trigger for the PETM, especially in the absence of
   plausible alternative mechanisms. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Upper mantle structure of Arctic Canada from Rayleigh wave dispersion}},
Journal = {{TECTONOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{405}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{1-23}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Models of upper mantle structure across the Canadian High Arctic region,
   from 62 North to 82 North, and 134 West to 56 West, are presented in
   this study. Teleseismic Rayleigh waves were recorded by an array of
   temporary and permanent broadband seismographs across the region.
   Fundamental-mode phase velocity dispersion curves were calculated for 84
   two-station paths. The period range for the majority of the dispersion
   curves was similar to 25-170 s, allowing the resolution of mantle
   structure to a depth of similar to 250-300 km. A tomographic inversion
   was used to combine dispersion data from 61 stable paths, to give a set
   of phase velocity maps for the region. The maps show a persistent
   high-velocity anomaly across the central-northern mainland, strongest in
   the period range 50-110 s, and a low-velocity anomaly along the Arctic
   continental margin at periods <= 90 s.
   A number of dispersion curves from two-station paths were chosen for
   further analysis, together with localised dispersion curves derived from
   the phase velocity maps, for areas with good path coverage. Analysis of
   these dispersion curves was carried out, using a Monte-Carlo method, to
   obtain 1-D models for shear wave velocity structure across the region,
   assuming an isotropic upper mantle.
   The average velocity of the upper 100-200 km of the mantle is compared
   to that of the iasp91 global reference model, and the variations in
   velocity perturbation are examined. The highest velocity perturbations,
   4-6\% above iasp91, occur in the southern part of the region and are,
   for the most part, associated with the Canadian Shield and southern
   Arctic Platform. In contrast, velocity perturbations of only 1-3\% above
   iasp91 characterise the northwestern Arctic islands, with the lowest
   velocities occurring beneath the Sverdrup Basin.
   The characteristics of the upper mantle velocity-depth sections also
   vary significantly. For paths crossing the central-northern mainland and
   Baffin Island, the Monte-Carlo models give near-constant velocity to at
   least 240 km depth in the upper mantle. The best match to the dispersion
   curves can be obtained by the inclusion of a shallower (similar to 200
   km depth) low-velocity zone, but this feature is not required to match
   the data within physically realistic error bounds. In the central Arctic
   islands, the models show a `lid' of relatively high velocities in the
   upper section of the mantle model, underlain by a low-velocity zone.
   This velocity pattern is consistent with previous interpretations of the
   character of the seismological lithosphere and asthenosphere. The base
   of the lid is difficult to identify, but negative velocity gradients are
   modelled over the similar to 100-200 km depth range. Along the Sverdrup
   Basin margins, where the velocity anomalies are smallest, the models are
   similar in character to the iasp91 reference profile, showing a gradual
   increase in velocity with depth. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A systematic study on the influence of functionality on adsorption of
   benzoate and phthalate at a-alumina-water interface was investigated.
   Kinetics of adsorption of benzoate and phthalate on a-alumina surfaces
   were performed at constant ionic strength, I= 5 x 10(-4) mol dm(-3) and
   pH 5 at 25, 30 and 40 degrees C. Kinetics results show that the rate of
   adsorption of phthalate is approximate to 2 times more than that of
   benzoate on a-alumina surfaces at 25 degrees C. The adsorption of
   benzoate and phthalate on a-alumina surfaces were carried out over a
   wide range of concentration of adsorbate at fixed ionic strength, I= 5 x
   10(-4) Mol dm(-3) and pH 5-10. The adsorption isotherms for both the
   systems were found to be Langmuir in nature. The maximum adsorption
   density of phthalate is 1.1-5.1 times more than that of benzoate on the
   same adsorbent under similar condition. This difference is attributed to
   the presence of adjacent -COOH group in phthalate. The activation energy
   for both the systems was calculated using Arrhenius equation. The other
   thermodynamics parameters like Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy
   were also calculated. The solubility of a-alumina in presence of
   benzoate and phthalate was found to be depended on the pH of the medium
   and the concentration of sodium chloride. The surface complexation of
   benzoate and phthalate on a-alumina surfaces were investigated using the
   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Benzoate forms
   outer-sphere complexes with alpha-alumina surfaces at pH 5 and 6
   depending on the shifting of the asymmetric and symmetric bands. Whereas
   phthalate forms both outer- and inner-sphere surface complexes with
   alpha-alumina surfaces. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

   mediated by spin-orbit coupling in the collisional removal of O-2(X

   communication {[}F. Dayou, J. Campos-Martinez, M. I. Hernandez, and R.
   Hernandez-Lamoneda, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 10355 (2004)]. The present work
   provides details on the electronic properties of the dimer (O-2)(2)
   relevant to the self-relaxation of O-2(X (3)Sigma(g)(-),v > 0) where V-E
   energy transfer involving the O-2(a (1)Delta(g)) and O-2(b
   (1)Sigma(g)(+)) states is incorporated. Two-dimensional electronic
   structure calculations based on highly correlated ab initio methods have
   been carried out for the potential-energy and spin-orbit coupling
   surfaces associated with the ground singlet and two low-lying excited
   triplet states of the dimer dissociating into O-2(X
   (3)Sigma(g)(-))+O-2(X (3)Sigma(g)(-)), O-2(a (1)Delta(g))+O-2(X
   (3)Sigma(g)(-)), and O-2(b (1)Sigma(g)(+))+O-2(X (3)Sigma(g)(-)). The
   resulting interaction potentials for the two excited triplet states
   display very similar features along the intermolecular separation,
   whereas differences arise with the ground singlet state for which the
   spin-exchange interaction produces a shorter equilibrium distance and
   higher binding energy. The vibrational dependence is qualitatively
   similar for the three studied interaction potentials. The spin-orbit
   coupling between the ground and second excited states is already nonzero
   in the O-2+O-2 dissociation limit and keeps its asymptotic value up to
   relatively short intermolecular separations, where the coupling
   increases for intramolecular distances close to the equilibrium of the
   isolated diatom. On the other hand, state mixing between the two excited
   triplet states leads to a noticeable collision-induced spin-orbit
   coupling between the ground and first excited states. The results are
   discussed in terms of specific features of the dimer electronic
   structure (including a simple four-electron model) and compared with
   existing theoretical and experimental data. This work gives theoretical
   insight into the origin of electronic energy-transfer mechanisms in
   O-2+O-2 collisions. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Neurotrophins mediate diverse biological responses,
   including maintenance and growth of neurons and synaptic plasticity in
   adult brain. This study examined whether suicide brain is associated
   with changes in the expression of neurotrophins.
   Methods. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of nerve growth factor
   (NGF), neurotrophin (NT)-3, NT-4/5, and of cyclophilin and
   neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were measured by quantitative reverse
   transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, whereas protein levels of
   neurotrophins were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus from 28 suicide victims and 21
   control subjects.
   Results: In hippocampus of suicide subjects compared with control
   subjects mRNA levels of NGF (p <.001), Arf-3 (p <.001), and NT-4/5 (p
   <.001) were decreased, whether or not they were expressed as a ratio to
   cyclophilin or NSE. This was accompanied by a decrease in their
   respective protein levels (NGF {[}p <.001], AT-3 {[}p <.001], and AT-4/5
   {[}p <. 0011). In PFC, however, mRNA (p =.001) and protein (p <.001)
   levels of NT-4/5 and only protein level of NGF (p <.001) were decreased;
   NT-3 levels were unchanged.
   Conclusions. Given the role of neurotrophins in synaptic plasticity and
   maintenance of adult neurons, our findings of altered expression of
   neurotrophins in postmortem brain of suicide victims suggest that these
   molecules might play a vital role in the pathophysiology of suicide.}},

Title = {{Low carbon dioxide permeability of the apical epithelial membrane of

Abstract = {{We have investigated the apical membrane permeability for CO2 of intact
   epithelia of proximal and distal colon of the guinea pig. The method
   used was the mass spectrometric O-18-exchange technique previously
   described. In a first step, we determined the intraepithelial carbonic
   anhydrase (CA) activity by studying vital isolated colonocytes before
   and after lysis with Triton X-100. Intraepithelial CA activity was found
   to be 41000 and 900 for proximal and distal colon, respectively. Then
   O-18-exchange measurements were done with stripped intact epithelial
   layers, which on their apical side were exposed to the reaction solution
   containing O-18-labelled CO2 and HCO3-. The mass spectrometric signals
   in these measurements arc determined by the intracellular epithelial CA
   activity, and by the apical membrane permeabilities for CO2 and HCO3-,
   P-CO2 and P-HCO3. From the signals, we calculated the two permeabilities
   while inserting the CA activities obtained from isolated colonocytes.
   From layers of intact colon epithelium, the apical P-CO2 was determined
   to be 1.5 x 10(-3) cm s(-1) for proximal and 0.77 x 10(-3) cm s(-1) for
   distal colon. These values are >= 200 times lower than the P-CO2 of the
   human red cell membrane as studied with the same technique (0.3 cm s-1).
   We conclude that the apical membrane offers a significant resistance
   towards CO2 diffusion, which implies that a major drop in CO2 partial
   pressure (PCO2) will occur across the apical membrane when luminal
   pCO(2) is higher than basolateral or capillary pCO(2). In view of the
   very high pCO(2) that can occur in the colonic lumen, this property of
   the apical membrane constitutes a significant protection of the cell
   against the high acid load associated with high pCO(2).}},

Abstract = {{Autocrine motility factor (AMF) is a cytokine known to regulate tumor
   cell motility. Recent studies have extended its role to many other
   aspects of cancer biology. In the present study, we examined the level
   of AMF expression and its relationship with vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) expression and the angiogenic phenotype in human gastric
   cancer and their effect on survival. The AMF and VEGF expression level
   and tumor microvessel density (MVD) status in archived tissue specimens
   from 86 resected gastric cancer cases were determined. AMF expression
   was significantly higher in both primary tumors and lymph node
   metastases than in adjacent normal gastric mucosa and normal gastric
   mucosa from individuals without gastric cancer. In univariate survival
   analyses, strong AMF expression was associated with inferior survival
   (P=0.028). In a Cox proportional hazards model, strong AMF expression
   (P=0.019) was independently prognostic of poor survival. Strong AMF
   expression in the lymph node metastases was associated with poor
   survival (P=0.011). Furthermore, AMF expression in the primary tumors
   was directly correlated with VEGF expression and MVD status. We found
   the first clinical evidence that AMF expression is directly correlated
   with VEGF expression and MVD status and predicts clinical outcome in
   patients with gastric cancer, supporting the hypothesis that the AMF/AMF
   receptor pathway plays an important role in multiple aspects of cancer
   biology.}},

Abstract = {{We addressed the need for histological assessment of myocellular domains
   occupied by monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4). From the
   perspective of lactate shuttle hypotheses we posited that MCTI would be
   highly expressed in oxidative fibres, whereas MCT4 would be found in
   highly glycolytic fibres. Furthermore, we hypothesized that MCTI would
   be detected at interfibrillar as well as at subsarcolemmal and
   sarcolemmal cell domains, whereas MCT2 and MCT4 abundances would be most
   prominent at the sarcolemma. To test these hypotheses, we examined
   cellular locations of MCTI, MCT2 and MCT4 transporter proteins in
   different fibre types (slow oxidative, SO; fast oxidative glycolytic,
   FOG; fast glycolytic, FG) in rat plantaris muscles by the avidin-biotin
   complex (ABC) as well as other methods. The plantaris was used as it is
   a mixed fibre skeletal muscle. MCTs, glucose transporter (GLUT4)
   protein, and mitochondrial constituent cytochrome oxidase (COX)
   abundances were assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting
   using affinity-purified antibodies. The staining method was specific and
   stable, which allowed for semiquantitative assessment of MCT expression.
   As well, confocal laser scanning microscopy assessed MCT isoform
   localizations. Findings of the present study were: (1) MCTI is located
   at the sarcolemma and throughout the cell interior in SO and FOG fibres
   where the mitochondrial reticulum was present; (2) in contrast, MCT4 was
   highly expressed in the sarcolemmal domain of FG and FOG fibres but
   poorly expressed in SO fibres; and (3) confocal laser-scanning
   microscopy demonstrated that MCT I and COX are co-localised at both
   interfibrillar and subsarcolemmal cell domains, whereas MCT2 is only
   faintly detected at the sarcolemma of oxidative fibres. MCTs and
   associated proteins are positioned to facilitate the function of the
   lactate shuttles.}},

Title = {{Experimental investigation of an atmospheric photoconductively switched
   high-voltage spark gap}},

Abstract = {{We report on the experimental investigation of the photoconductively
   switched gas-filled spark gap. When the laser intensity of a femtosecond
   laser is high enough (around 10(18) W m(-2)), a plasma can be created
   that spans the complete distance between the electrodes. The gas-filled
   spark gap is then closed on a femtosecond time scale, similar to
   photoconductive switching of a semiconductor switch. Stochastic
   breakdown processes, such as avalanche and streamer formation that cause
   the breakdown in laser triggered spark gaps, are passed over, which
   results in faster rise time and less jitter. Measurements of the
   switched pulses as a function of laser energy were performed in a 1-mm
   gap at an applied voltage of 4.5 kV. A clear transition from triggering
   to switching was measured with increased laser energy. Measurements of
   the output pulses with the gap filled with nitrogen at 1 atm showed
   results very similar to measurements in air in the same gap. In the
   switching regime, the amplitude of the switched pulse did not depend
   strongly on the laser energy. Measurements at lower applied voltages but
   with the same gap distance showed that it was possible to switch
   voltages as low as 10\% of the self-breakdown voltage. At low applied
   voltages, a significant difference between the applied voltage and the
   output voltage is measured. A possible explanation is given based on the
   dynamic behavior of the laser-created plasma. The measured rise time and
   jitter of the switched pulses were both below the resolution of the
   measurement equipment, i.e., better than 100 and 15 ps, respectively.

   Zindler and S.R. Hart. Chemical geodynamics. Ann. Rev. Earth Planet.
   Sci., 14, (1986) 493-571]. We report here the observation of apparent
   correlations between mantle neon and radiogenic isotopes (Sr, Nd and Pb)
   in these samples. Combined geochemical data from the Pitcairn Seamounts
   suggest apparent mixing of a MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) component and
   an enriched mantle component of EM-I type. The neon data indicate that
   the EM-I component is extremely enriched in primordial solar noble
   gases. Since radiogenic isotope and trace element data strongly suggest
   the influence of a subducted crustal component in the EM-I source, the
   neon results require a hypothetical reservoir in the mantle in which
   primordial and recycled components are mixed. These results provide
   significant new evidence for the deep origin of some mantle plumes.
   In contrast to neon, there is no apparent correlation between helium
   isotope compositions and radiogenic isotopes in the Pitcairn Seamount
   samples. Positive correlations are observed, however, between ratios of
   observed He-4 to nucleogenic Ne-21 (Ne-21(n)) against the total helium
   concentrations and MgO contents, suggesting that preferential loss of
   mantle helium has occurred, possibly by interaction with seawater during
   assimilation-fractional crystallization processes. This observation
   provides a cautionary note for the interpretation of helium isotope
   results from other oceanic basalt suites. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The need for accurate, robust in situ microscale monitoring of
   oxidation-reduction potentials (ORP) is required for continuous soil
   pore water quality monitoring. We are developing a suite of
   self-contained microelectrodes that can be used in the environment, such
   as at Superfund sites, to monitor ORP in contaminated soils and
   sediments. This paper presents details on our development of
   microelectrode sensor arrays for ORP measurements. The electrochemical
   performance of these ORP electrodes was fully characterized by measuring
   redox potentials in standard solutions. It found that the newly
   developed integrated ORP microelectrodes produced a very stable voltage
   response (the corresponding rate of the integrated microelectrode
   potential change was in the range of 0.6-1.1 mV/min), even when the
   measurement was carried out outside of a Faraday cage where signals from
   most conventional microelectrodes are usually inhibited by external
   electrical nose. These new microelectrodes were easier to fabricate and
   were more robust than conventional microelectrodes, The tip size of the
   integrated ORP microelectrode was approximately 200 nm square, with a
   taper angle of approximately 201 and a length of 57 mu m. The integrated
   ORP microelectrode exhibited better signal stability and substantially
   shorter response times (from less than a few milliseconds to 30 s,
   depending on the standard solution used) than the commercial
   millielectrocle (a few minutes). Compared with the slope of the
   commercial millelectrode, the slope of the integrated microelectrode
   (61.5 mV/pH) was closer to the ideal slope against quinhydrone
   calibration solutions. Therefore, it is to be expected that the newly
   developed ORP microelectrode may have wider applications in contaminated
   soils, biofilms, and sediments.}},

Abstract = {{In search for conglomerates of stereochemically labile organometallic
   reagents, three new complexes between diethylzinc and diamine ligands

   N,N,N',N'-tetraethylethylenediamine (teeda),
   N-isopropyl-N,N',N'-trimethylethylenediamine (itmeda), and (-)-sparteine
   (spa). Diethylzinc forms monomeric complexes, exhibiting a distorted
   tetrahedral coordination geometry around zinc in all three complexes,
   viz. {[}ZnEt2(teeda)] (1), {[}ZnEt2(itmeda)] (2), and {[}ZnEt2(spa)]
   (3). Both 1 and 2 are stereochemically labile and exhibit chiral
   complexes, displaying different types of conformational chirality, but
   they form racemic crystals. By using the chiral crystals of 3 in a
   nucleophilic addition to benzaldehyde in the absence of solvent at low
   temperature, an increase in ee from approximately 8 to 10\% was obtained
   (compared to the same reaction in solution). It thus seems feasible, not
   only to retain the enantioselectivity obtained in solution, but perhaps
   even to increase the ee by using solventless reactions. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Asthma is characterized by an increase in airway smooth muscle mass and
   a decreased distance between the smooth muscle layer and the epithelium.
   Furthermore, there is evidence to indicate that airway smooth muscle
   cells (ASMC) express a wide variety of receptors involved in the immune
   response. The aims of this study were to examine the expression of CCR3
   on ASMC, to compare this expression between asthmatic and nonasthmatic
   subjects, and to determine the implications of CCR3 expression in the
   migration of ASMC. We first demonstrated that ASMC constitutively
   express CCR3 at both mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, TNF-alpha
   increases ASMC surface expression of CCR3 from 33 to 74\%. Furthermore,
   using FACS analysis, we found that ASNIC CCR3 is expressed to a greater
   degree in asthmatic vs control subjects (95 vs 75\%). Functionality of
   the receptor was demonstrated by calcium assay; the addition of CCR3
   ligand eotaxin to ASMC resulted in an increase in intracellular calcium
   production. Interestingly, ASMC was seen to demonstrate a positive
   chemotactic response to eotaxin. Indeed, ASMC significantly migrated
   toward 100 ng/ml eotaxin (2.2-fold increase, compared with control). In
   conclusion, the expression of CCR3 by ASMC is increased in asthmatics,
   and our data show that a CCR3 ligand such as eotaxin induces migration
   of ASMC in vitro. These results may suggest that eotaxin could be
   involved in the increased smooth muscle mass observed in asthmatics
   through the activation of CCR3.}},

   The dependence of Mo content on the crystallinity, surface area, and
   acidic properties of ZrO2-MoO3 is Studied and evaluated as a function of
   molybdenum loading. The monoclinic phase is observed at low Mo loadings,
   with the tetragonal polymorph of ZrO2 effectively stabilized at higher
   Mo loadings. The surface area of ZrO2-MoO3 increases with molybdenum
   content to a maximum value of 124 m(2) g(-1) at a loading of 15.8 at.\%
   Mo, followed by a decrease at higher Mo loadings. Isothermal CO2
   adsorption and ammonia TPD results indicate the strength of basic sites
   and specific NH3 desorption decreases with increasing molybdenum
   content, while TPR indicates ZrO2-MoO3 catalysts are more easily reduced
   with increasing molybdenum loading. The most active catalyst for mcp

Abstract = {{The correct interpretation of any biological experiment depends in an
   essential way on the accuracy and consistency of the existing annotation
   databases. Such databases are ubiquitous and used by all life scientists
   in most experiments. However, it is well known that such databases are
   incomplete and many annotations may also be incorrect. In this paper we
   describe a technique that can be used to analyze the semantic content of
   such annotation databases. Our approach is able to extract implicit
   semantic relationships between genes and functions. This ability allows
   us to discover novel functions for known genes. This approach is able to
   identify missing and inaccurate annotations in existing annotation
   databases, and thus help improve their accuracy. We used our technique
   to analyze the current annotations of the human genome. From this body
   of annotations, we were able to predict 212 additional gene-function
   assignments. A subsequent literature search found that 138 of these
   gene-functions assignments are supported by existing peer-reviewed
   papers. An additional 23 assignments have been confirmed in the meantime
   by the addition of the respective annotations in later releases of the
   Gene Ontology database. Overall, the 161 confirmed assignments represent
   75.95\% of the proposed gene-function assignments. Only one of our
   predictions (0.4\%) was contradicted by the existing literature. We
   could not find any relevant articles for 50 of our predictions
   (23.58\%). The method is independent of the organism and can be used to
   analyze and improve the quality of the data of any public or private

Abstract = {{Pleurotus ostrearus proteinase A inhibitor I (POIA1), which was
   discovered as a protease inhibitor, is unique in that it shows sequence
   homology to the propeptide of subtilisin, which functions as an
   intramolecular of a cognate protease. In this study, we demonstrate that
   POIA1 can function as an intramolecular chaperone of subtilisin by in
   vitro and in vivo experiments. The specific cleavage between POIA1 and
   the mature region of subtilisin BPN' occurred in a refolding process of
   a chimera protein, and Bacillus cells transformed with a chimera gene
   formed a halo on a skim milk plate. The mutational analyses of POIA1 in
   the chimera protein suggested that the tertiary structure of POIA1 is
   required for such a function, and that an increase in its ability to
   bind to subtilisin BPN' makes POIA1 a more effective intramolecular
   chaperone. (c) 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

   The method accounts for the correlation of ground and excited states, is
   capable of describing explicitly time-dependent, nonlinear phenomena,

   test system in which the charge distribution and hence the dipole moment
   are shown to be switchable, in a controlled fashion, by (a series of)
   laser pulses which induce selective, state-to-state electronic
   transitions. One focus of our time-dependent calculations is the
   question of how fast the transition from the ionic ground state to a
   specific excited state that is embedded in a multitude of other states
   can be made, without creating an electronic wave packet. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The two oligonucleotide strands of a siRNA duplex are functionally

   RISC assembly in zebrafish using an intronic miRNA-like vector to target
   EGFP mRNA for regulation. The position of the stemloop in a precursor
   miRNA (pre-miRNA) was involved in the determination of miRNA-miRNA{*}
   asymmetry of the pre-miRNA stemarm, leading to different miRNA
   maturation during miRISC assembly. These findings suggest that the
   miRISC assembly is likely different from the RISC assembly model of
   siRNA in zebrafish, providing the first in vivo evidence for asymmetric
   miRISC assembly. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Statins are antilipidemic agents that exhibit a variety of
   cellular effects independent of their lipid-lowering action. A
   retrospective study was undertaken to establish the impact of statins on
   graft outcome in the first year posttransplantation.
   Methods. Data from patients with uniform immunosuppression
   (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone) who underwent
   transplantation at the authors' unit from 1997 to 2002 were reviewed.
   Patients prescribed statins were compared with those not on a statin.
   Mean change in creatinine clearance (CrCl) from 3 to 12 months
   posttransplantation was calculated. Histomorphometric analysis was used
   to quantify fractional interstitial area and collagen III deposition in
   matched preperfusion and 12-month protocol biopsy specimens.
   Results. Seventy-seven patients met study criteria: statin, n=44
   patients; nonstatin, n=33 patients. Median time to commencing a statin
   was 5 weeks. At 3 months, CrCl (+/- SEM) was similar: 51.6 +/- 2.9
   mL/min (statin) versus 51.3 +/- 1 mL/min (nonstatin). At 12 months, the
   mean change in CrCl was 4.1 +/- 1 mL/min (statin) compared with -2.0 +/-
   1.8 mL/min (nonstatin), resulting in a difference of 6.13 mL/min at 12
   months (P < 0.005). Mean preperfusion fractional interstitial areas were
   similar (23.9 +/- 1.6\%; P=not significant {[}NS]). On 12-month biopsy
   specimens, the fractional interstitial area had increased to 34 +/-
   3.2\% in the nonstatin group (P < 0.005), with no change in the statin
   group. Interstitial collagen III deposition was similar in preperfusion
   biopsyspecimens (10.4 +/- 1\%; P=NS), but at 12 months it was
   significantly greater in the nonstatin group (17.6 +/- 1\%; P < 0.05)
   Conclusions. Early introduction of statins may be associated with
   improved 1-year graft outcome.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{16}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Unstirred boundary layers (UBLs) often act as a bottleneck for the
   diffusive transport of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in the
   environment. Therefore, a microscale technique was developed for
   quantifying mass transfer through a 100-mu m thin UBL, with the medium
   composition of the UBL as the controllable factor. The model compound
   fluoranthene had to (1) partition from a contaminated silicone disk
   (source) into the medium, (2) then diffuse through 100 mu m of medium
   (UBL), and finally (3) partition into a clean silicone layer (sink). The
   diffusive mass transfer from source to sink was monitored over time by
   measuring the fluoranthene content of the source and sink disks. The
   diffusive flux of fluoranthene was slightly higher for air than for
   water. Cyclodextrin, humic acids, and micelles of sodium dodecyl sulfate
   (SDS) enhanced the diffusive flux of fluoranthene in water by more than
   1 order of magnitude. These results demonstrate that medium
   constituents, which normally are believed to bind hydrophobic organic
   chemicals, actually can enhance the diffusive mass transfer of HOCs in
   the vicinity of a diffusion source (e.g., contaminated soil particles).
   The technique can be used to evaluate the effect of natural fluids on
   diffusive mass transfer, as it integrates the different processes,
   partitioning and diffusion, in one laboratory model.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of structure sensitivity in the heterolytic exchange of
   isotopic oxygen with the surface of a series of magnesium oxide samples
   has been probed. Two general approaches have been adopted: (i) variation
   in particle size for MgO samples exhibiting the 1100) termination plane
   and (ii) variation in termination plane by alteration of the preparation
   method. In the former case, the surface area normalised exchange rate is
   found to vary insignificantly for the samples tested, despite a
   variation in their surface areas of nearly an order of magnitude. In
   addition, at the temperatures employed, only a fraction of a monolayer
   of the available oxygen is found to exchange, and, once exchanged, sites
   can be re-exchanged back with very similar reaction kinetics. It is
   proposed that the mechanism of reaction may involve the formation and
   decomposition of intermediate ozonide species generated on reaction of
   gas-phase O-2 with surface O-, or is associated with the presence of
   ensembles of reactive low coordinate Mg2+O2- pairs. Studies involving
   samples prepared via different routes have demonstrated the order of
   activity to be I I I I I or {[} 110) mean surface planes > {[} 100) > I
   I I I), suggesting a beneficial role for ensembles of low coordinate
   Mg2+O2- ion pairs. In addition, it has been found that samples prepared
   from hydroxide-based precursors exhibit activity in the exchange process
   involving two lattice ions (R-2). This has been rationalised in terms of
   the exchange of diatomic surface species, such as peroxide ions and/or
   superoxide ions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   detailed quantitative description of the phase transformation from the
   nonferroelectric fluorite to ferroelectric Aurivillius phase including
   changes in the microstructure and surface roughness are extracted. These
   results are correlated to electrical characteristics from hysteresis
   loop and leakage current measurements of corresponding Pt/SBT/Pt
   capacitor modules. As a result, increased values of remnant polarization
   can directly be correlated to the Aurivillius surface coverage. It is
   shown that the measured leakage currents are dominantly influenced by
   the grain boundaries and, therefore, are very sensitive on the overall
   film granularity. The SBT roughness is not predominant for the leakage
   currents, but is very critical for capacitor shorting. Potentially, the
   results provided with this work provide instruments for design of
   electrical characteristics, to meet desired FeRAM specifications. (c)

Abstract = {{IL-4 receptor (IL-4R)-deficient CD8+ T cells specific for the
   circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium yoelii develop a severely
   impaired memory response after priming with parasites. Memory CD8(+) T
   cells lacking the IL-4R are unable to establish a stable population
   residing in nonlymphoid organs, although they develop normally in
   lymphoid organs. Because memory cells from nonlymphoid organs disappear
   shortly after immunization, the protective antiparasitic activity of
   this T cell response also is lost. These results demonstrate that
   IL-4/IL-4R interactions on CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in
   modulating the development and tissue distribution of memory cells
   induced by parasite immunization. They also indicate that memory cells
   residing in nonlymphoid tissues are critical for protective immunity

Abstract = {{Purpose: We aimed to find key molecules associated with chemoresistance
   in ovarian cancer using gene expression profiling as a screening tool.
   Experimental Design: Using two newly established paclitaxel-resistant
   ovarian cancer cell lines from an original paclitaxel-sensitive cell
   line and four supersensitive and four refractory surgical ovarian cancer
   specimens from paclitaxel-based chemotherapy, molecules associated with
   chemoresistance were screened with gene expression profiling arrays
   containing 39,000 genes. We further analyzed 44 genes that showed
   significantly different expressions between paclitaxel-sensitive samples
   and paclitaxel-resistant samples with permutation tests, which were
   common in cell lines and patients' tumors.
   Results: Eight of these genes showed reproducible results with real-time
   reverse transcription-PCR, of which indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase gene
   expression was the most prominent and consistent. Moreover, by
   immunohistochemical analysis using a total of 24 serous-type ovarian
   cancer surgical specimens (stage III, n = 21; stage IV, n = 7),
   excluding samples used for GeneChip analysis, the Kaplan-Meier survival
   curve showed a clear relationship between indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
   staining patterns and overall survival (log-rank test, P = 0.0001). All
   patients classified as negative survived without relapse. The 50\%
   survival of patients classified as sporadic, focal, and diffuse was
   41,17, and 11 months, respectively.
   Conclusion: The indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase screened with the GeneChip
   was positively associated with paclitaxel resistance and with impaired
   survival in patients with serous-type ovarian cancer.}},

Abstract = {{mus308 designates one of over 30 mutagen sensitivity loci found in
   Drosophila. It is predicted to code for a 229-kDa polypeptide. Published
   sequence analyses of others indicate that this polypeptide would have
   helicase motifs near its N-terminus, and similarities to bacterial DNA
   polymerase I-like enzymes near its C-terminus. In our studies, two
   different and highly specific antibodies were prepared and used for
   identification as well as characterization of the mus308 gene product.
   Western blot analyses reveal a single reactive polypeptide in both
   ovaries and embryos as well as in two Drosophila embryo tissue culture
   cell lines; it is nearly absent in homozygous mus308 mutants. This
   polypeptide is about 229 kDa in size, and indirect immunofluorescence
   shows that the mus308 gene product localizes throughout nuclei in
   wild-type cells but appears to be absent in a mus308 mutant. Immunoblot
   analyses throughout development suggest greatest abundance at the end of
   embryogenesis, immediately before hatching of first instar larvae. They
   also showed a smaller (similar to 100kDa) antigenically and genetically
   related polypeptide found only in adult males. Immunoprecipitation, a
   highly effective method of specific purification, suggests that the
   mus308 protein has DNA polymerase activity that is NEM-sensitive but
   largely aphidicolin-resistant. In addition, the immunoprecipitated
   material has DNA-dependent ATPase but lacks detectable helicase. (c)

Abstract = {{Rheological behavior of silica gel in sulfuric acid was investigated
   with a small amplitude dynamic oscillation measurement method in which
   storage `modulus was monitored with time. For the purpose of
   quantitative discussion, gelation rate was defined as the time required
   for the storage modulus to be 1000 Pa, and denoted as t(1000). The
   storage modulus was defined as `gel strength'. As silica content,
   sulfuric acid concentration, or the amount of added polyacrylamide
   increased, the gel strength and gelation rate were increased at the same
   time. While the increase of gel strength is desirable for long service
   life of a gel battery, the increase of gelation rate makes it difficult
   to fill the gel into the battery. However, this increase of gelation
   rate was found to be compensated by lowering the gelation temperatures A
   phase plane plot of-gelation time (t(1000)) against gel strength (G')
   was proposed to optimize the gel in terms of gel strength and gelation
   time. By using this phase plane plot, the gel strength was found to be
   increased by 40 \% without sacrificing the gelation rate. This was
   possible because the slopes on the phase plane plot are different
   depending on the independent variables. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The fulfillment of counselees' expectations in cancer genetic counseling
   and how this affects the outcome of counseling have received little
   attention so far. This study investigates how the initial consultation
   influences counselees' cognitions and anxiety, whether counselors
   address counselees' prior needs and preferences during the visit, and
   whether addressing needs is associated with a more positive outcome of
   the visit. One hundred twenty-eight affected and unaffected counselees
   from families with no known mutation, who were seen by one of fourteen
   counselors, participated. Pre- and post-visit questionnaires assessed
   correct knowledge about hereditary breast or colon cancer, perceived
   personal control (PPC), anxiety (STAI), risk perceptions, and
   (fulfillment of) needs (QUOTE-gene(ca)). Results demonstrated a pre- to
   post-visit significant increase in correct knowledge and PPC, and a
   significant decrease in STAI and risk perceptions. However, marked
   overestimation of risks persisted. Decrease in STAI and risk perceptions
   was significantly less pronounced in affected versus unaffected
   counselees. The majority of counselees were (very) satisfied about the
   extent to which their needs were addressed, albeit about one-fifth were
   not regarding emotional matters and explanations about their own cancer
   risk. Finally, the better counselees perceived their needs to be
   fulfilled, the significantly higher their PPC and the significantly
   lower their STAi scores were. Findings suggest that both unaffected and
   affected counselees should be counseled carefully. Also, a more
   effective service may be attained if counselors pay more attention to
   counselees' emotional needs and detail more inheritance and penetrance
   of mutated genes in relation to counselees' family history. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Up to now subsurface information permitted the delineation of the top of
   the Triassic salt, all throughout the Cantabro-Navarro domain, although
   little was known on the location and geometry of its base and thus on
   the estimation of the total salt thickness. A 3D-gravity inversion
   scheme combined with a 3D analytic method has been conducted to map out
   the geometry of the main salt structures of the basin. The gravity
   modeling results have been constrained by well log information and
   available geological and reflection seismic data. The combined 3D scheme
   integrated with available geological and geophysical data has allowed us
   to obtain the geometry of the main diapirs that characterize the central
   and marginal regions of the basin.
   From our interpretation, the Salinas de Afiana diapir has almost
   vertical flanks and can be divided into two different parts, one of them
   forming a lateral overhang of the main body.
   The Salinas de Oro diapir has near vertical flanks and a main axis in
   the N-S direction. Also, the anomaly is rather more extensive than the
   outcrop of the diapir, which implies an important expansion of
   non-outcropping salt in this area. Like the Hoz-Sobron diapir, the
   Salinas de Ollo diapir is long and narrow. stretching in the NW-SE
   direction, which includes three important highs, plus an intense zone of
   salt migration.
   The Estella and Alloz diapirs crop out individually in spite of being
   connected at depth. Also two non-outcropping salt domes have been
   detected to the south of Atauri that, like the Estella diapir, are
   related to the thrust front. We point out the gravity signature of the
   Murguia diapir, which shows an intense gravity high probably due to the
   presence of high-density rocks in the cap rock or more probably due to
   the existence of Triassic volcanites of ophitic texture pinched-off into
   the diapir. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   polymeric matrices were used to produce poly(3-aminopropyl

   reported for membranes containing phosphotungstic acid, the PMoA
   coalesced into mass-fractal structure, with fractal-dimension 1.85. The
   largest fractal aggregate was about 524 angstrom. Moreover, WAXS curves
   evidenced the crystallization of this heteropolyacid during the casting
   process. No changes concerning the distribution of PMoA were observed in
   the membranes containing SPEEK, PMoA and the poly(3-aminopropyl

   denser surface fractal-like structures constituted by the heteropolyacid

Abstract = {{Ba3-xLaxCe3Ti5Nb5O30 (x = 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5) compounds were prepared by
   the solid state reaction of the constituent oxides. They all have the
   same tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB)-type structure as shown by XRD and
   they show semiconducting behaviour (if other rare earths are used in
   place of cerium, the compounds are insulators as reported earlier).
   Increasing the amount of La3+ causes only a moderate increase in
   electrical conductivity of the compound and a decrease in the activation
   energy of the current carriers. The electrical conductivity at 300
   degrees C for x = 0.5 is 4.26 x 10(-4) S/cm and for x = 1.5, it is 9.14
   x 10(-4) S/cm. Activation energy of the current carriers is 0.364 eV for
   x = 0.5 and 0.345 eV for x = 1.5. It is possible that La-3, incorporated
   in the lattice has two effects, as a donor dopant in place of Ba2+ and
   in creating Ba2+ vacancies. The grain morphology of the dense ceramics
   observed by means of scanning electron microscopy is also presented. (c)

Abstract = {{Paleostress orientations were calculated from fault-slip data of 36
   sites located along a traverse through the Central Betic Cordilleras
   (southern Spain). Heterogeneous fault sets, which are frequent in the
   area, have been divided into homogeneous subsets by cross-cutting
   relationships observed in the field and by a paleostress stratigraphy
   approach applied on each individual fault population. The state of
   stress was sorted according to main tectonic events and a new chronology
   is presented of the Miocene to Recent deformation in the central part of
   the Belie Cordilleras. The deviatoric stress tensors fall into four
   distinct groups that are regionally consistent and correlate with three
   Late Oligocene-Aquitanian to Recent major tectonic events in the Belie
   Cordilleras. The new chronology of the neotectonic evolution includes,
   from oldest to youngest, the following main tectonic phases:
   (1) Late Oligocene-Aquitanian to Early Tortonian: sigma(1) subhorizontal
   N-S, partly E-W directed, sigma(3) subvertical; compressional structures
   (thrusting of nappes, large-scale folding) and strike-slip faulting in
   the Alboran Domain and the External Zone of the Betic Cordilleras;
   (2) Early Tortonian to Pliocene-Pleistocene: a 1 subvertical, 93
   subhorizontal NW-SE, partly N-S directed or E-W-directed (radial
   extension); large-scale normal faulting in the Central Betic Cordilleras
   and in the oldest Neogene formations of the Granada Basin related to the
   gravitational collapse of the Betic Cordilleras and the exhumation of
   the intensely metamorphosed rock series of the Internal Zones, at the
   same time formation of the Alboran Basin and intramontane basins such as
   the Granada Basin;
   (3) Pleistocene to Recent: (3a) sigma(1) subvertical, sigma(3)
   subhorizontal NE-SW with prominent normal faulting, but coevally; (3b)
   sigma(1) subhorizontal NW directed, sigma(3) NE-SW subhorizontal with
   strike-slip faulting. Extensional structures and strike-slip faulting
   are related to the ongoing convergence of the Eurasian and African
   Plates and coeval uplift of the Belie Cordilleras. Reactivation of
   pre-existing fractures and faults was frequently observed. Phase 3 is
   interpreted as periodic strike-slip and normal faulting events due to a
   permutation of the principal stress axes, mainly sigma(1) and sigma(2).

Abstract = {{Gaucher disease (GD), an autosomal recessive disease, is characterized
   by accumulation of glucosylceramide mainly in cells of the
   reticuloendothelial system, due to mutations in the acid
   beta-glucocerebrosidase gene. Some of the patients suffer from
   neurological symptoms (type 2 and type 3 patients), whereas patients
   with type I GD do not present neurological signs. The disease is
   heterogeneous even among patients with the same genotype, implicating
   that a mutation in the glucocerebrosidase gene is required to cause GD
   but other factors play an important role in the manifestation of the
   disease. Glucocerebrosidase is a lysosomal enzyme, synthesized on
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound polyribosomes and translocated into the
   ER. Following Winked glycosylations, it is transported to the Golgi
   apparatus, from where it is trafficked to the lysosomes. In this study,
   we tested glucocerebrosidase protein levels, N-glycans processing and
   intracellular localization in skin fibroblasts derived from patients
   with GD. Our results strongly suggest that mutant glucocerebrosidase
   variants present variable levels of ER retention and undergo
   ER-associated degradation in the proteasomes. The degree of ER retention
   and proteasomal degradation is one of the factors that determine GD
   severity.}},

Abstract = {{We use an analytic Bloch-mode approach to investigate one-dimensional
   planar Bragg waveguides (PBWGs) with an air- or a glass-core layer
   sandwiched within two symmetric Bragg gratings formed by alternate
   arrays of air and glass layers. The calculation results show that there
   exist simultaneously two kinds of guided modes as the gap-guided modes
   resulting from the photonic band-gap effect and the index-guided modes
   formed by the total internal reflection effect. We calculate the
   electromagnetic (EM)-field distributions of these guided modes with
   different parallel wave vectors and find remarkably different EM-field
   profiles between the index-guided modes and the gap-guided modes. In
   order to explore the propagation properties of the PBWGs, we analyze the
   group velocity and the group-velocity dispersion of different types of
   guided modes. The results show that the guided mode properties are
   significantly influenced by the core material as well as the cladding
   structure. The analytic Bloch-mode approach can help to investigate and

   Langerhans cell and dendritic-cell migration and its impact on T-cell
   priming in SPARC-null (SPARC(-/-)) and SPARC-sufficient (SPARC(+/+))

Abstract = {{The automotive manufacturing industry is an extremely competitive one.
   Many companies are focusing on their supply chains for sources of
   competitive advantage. This paper presents the findings of an
   exploratory study that examined contemporary issues related to supply
   chains in the Australian automotive manufacturing industry. Data from
   interviews with managers from vehicle manufacturers, component
   suppliers, peak industry bodies and government agencies enabled the
   articulation of 10 key issues. These issues were validated as being
   relevant to the industry by another group of managers from the industry.
   Review of these 10 issues showed that the relationships between the
   parties in supply chains are complex, and despite the success of the
   industry, there are a number of structural weaknesses. These issues,
   when taken individually, pose significant risks to the industry. When
   considered collectively, these risks are magnified several fold. This
   paper also presents research questions in the form of formal
   propositions associated with the 10 issues that need to be rigorously
   tested in order to assess the long-term viability and success of the
   industry. The issues that are raised can also be relevant to other
   industries with similar supply chain dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{There are certain controls which operate to demarcate the nature and
   size range of quartz particles in terrestrial detrital sediments. The
   particles fall into discrete and definable populations, which are
   separated by `Tanner gaps'. Quartz sand nature is determined largely by
   a eutectic-like reaction, which takes place in the original igneous
   rock. This reaction delivers a fine mix of quartz and feldspar units,
   which on weathering deliver quartz sand. The formation of quartz silt is
   more contentious; it appears that silt production is essentially
   controlled by the presence in larger quartz particles of `Moss defects',
   crystalline defects introduced into the quartz structure by earlier
   events, e.g. the high-low displacive transformation in cooling quartz.
   There appear to be two modes in airborne quartz particles (which have
   been called large dust and small dust). The larger mode is the loess
   mode (around 20-60 mu m) and the smaller mode falls into the
   classification with high-level, long-travel dust (mode around 2-6 mu m).
   The quartz in small dust is around the same size as the clay mineral
   agglomerate particles (CMA) which form a considerable proportion of high
   level dust clouds. The CMA particles form from lake deposits; the size
   is controlled by the openness of the packing in the lake sediments. This
   can be demonstrated by a simple Monte Carlo model. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   We use single-stranded DNA-capped colloidal gold that is linked by
   complementary linker DNA to form the assemblies. We found that, compared
   to free DNA, a sharp melting transition is observed for the DNA-linked
   colloidal gold assemblies. The structure of the assemblies is
   non-crystalline, much like a gel phase, consistent with theoretical
   predictions. Optical spectra and melting curves provide additional
   evidence of gelation of the colloidal system. The phase transition and
   separation are examples of percolation in a dilute solvent. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The polynomials determined in the Bernstein (Bezier) basis enjoy
   considerable popularity in computer-aided design (CAD) applications. The
   common situation in these applications is, that polynomials given in the
   basis of degree n have to be represented in the basis of higher degree.
   The corresponding transformation algorithms are called algorithms for
   degree elevation of Bernstein polynomial representations. These
   algorithms are only then of practical importance if they do not require
   the ill-conditioned conversion between the Bernstein and the power
   basis. We discuss all the algorithms of this kind known in the
   literature and compare them to the new ones we establish. Some among the
   latter are better conditioned and not more expensive than the currently
   used ones. All these algorithms can be applied componentwise to
   vector-valued polynomial Bezier representations of curves or surfaces.

   from Mg-3(VO4)(2) by a reaction with CCl2F2 or the major intermediate

Abstract = {{The paper presents the analysis of the model of a catalytic membrane
   with the enzymatic gel layer immobilized on membrane surface. The
   reaction proceeds in a two-liquid phase system with organic phase serves
   as the substrate reservoir and water phase as the products receiver. The
   reaction runs in gel layer where catalyst is concentrated.
   Influence of enzymatic gel layer parameters on the value of the
   substrate flux entering this layer and on the conversion degree was
   studied. The case when the substrate concentration in water phase is
   zero as well as different than zero was considered.
   The particular role of the value of Thiele modulus causing directly with
   the parameters of applied biocatalyst gel layer was shown. For the value
   higher than 3.5, the values of flux entering the layer reach a plateau
   and the conversion degree attains the values close to unity. Hence, for
   a given system there is a boundary value of gel thickness, which when
   exceeded does not cause a further process intensification and the
   catalyst is not using completely. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Two kinds of solids were obtained for Sc(PMBP)(3) by precipitation from
   different solvents. They were light-yellow crystal and yellowish-white
   powder, and their melting points were 209 and 217 degrees C,
   respectively. Raman spectra of six anhydrous samples prepared from these
   materials were measured and classified into two types of spectral
   patterns. Raman solute spectra of these two materials were measured in a
   dilute solution of dichloromethane, in which the solute is a free
   molecule in a solvent cage. Their spectra were considerably similar to
   each other, but they indicated clear differences in some pairs of bands.
   One of these two molecules was concluded to be a facial form of
   Sc(PMBP)3, because the other constituent has been established to be a
   meridional form of Sc(PMBP)3 by X-ray analysis of a single crystal.
   Structural optimization for mer- and fac-Sc(PMBP)(3) and their
   vibrational calculation of frequencies and intensities were carried out
   with the density functional method of B3LYP/6-31G{*}{*}. Their computed
   Raman spectra were well coincident with their observed spectra. The
   existence of fac-Sc(PMBP)3 has been established by thermal analysis,
   Raman spectroscopy and ab initio calculation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The Ti/TiN/TiCN/DLC multilayer coating on the microdrill was processed
   in a hybrid PVD-ECRCVD coating system (HBS900). Functionally gradient
   Ti/TiN/TiCN supporting multilayer was pre-deposited initially on the
   microdrill in order to improve the adhesion strength of the DLC films.
   The following dry lubricant coating on it is composed of amorphous,
   diamondlike carbon (DLC) deposited by ECRCVD plasma in the same
   recipient. For drilling applications, the combination of hard/soft
   coating layers, TiN/TiCN/DLC, allows it to improve chip flow with a
   lowered coefficient of friction and reduced cutting force. In view of
   further cost reduction, technically the Ti/TiN/TiCN/DLC multilayer
   coating on microdrill could serve this purpose best. Functionally, in
   adapting a microdrill coated with DLC film, the quality of hole after
   inspection was found sufficiently superior than that of uncoated ones,
   and the drilling lifetime obtained a significant improvement reaching
   about 2.5 times. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Apoptosis of murine and human macrophages induced by group B
   Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) is likely an important virulence
   mechanism that is used by the bacteria to suppress the host immune
   response and to persist at sites of infection. The mechanisms by which
   GBS induces apoptosis are, however, largely unknown. In this study, we
   report that in murine macrophages GBS induces unique changes in the
   regulation and localization of the apoptotic regulators Bad, 14-3-3, and
   Omi/high-temperature requirement A2 and leads to the release of
   cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Furthermore,
   inhibition of caspase-3 impaired GBS-induced apoptosis of macrophages.
   The ability to modulate the activity of effector caspases may therefore
   represent an unexploited avenue for therapeutic intervention in GBS
   infections.}},

   4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4
   Hpyran (DCJTB) as an ultrathin emitting layer. When 0.1 nm DCJTB was
   inserted between the hole-transporting layer and electron-transporting
   layer, for an unoptimized device indium-tin oxide
   (ITO)/naphtylphenyliphenyl diamine (NPB)/DCJTB (0.1
   nm)/8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq(3))/Al, the maximum brightness was
   1531 cd m(-2) at 15 V. Compared with doped devices ITO/NPB/Alq(3):DCJTB
   (1\%)/Alq(3)/LiF/Al, a higher efficiency has been achieved. Compared
   with the conventional device ITO/NPB/Alq(3)/Al, the inserted device has
   a slightly higher current efficiency and lower turn-on voltage. We
   suggest the ultrathin DCJTB layer acts as trap for carriers, and the
   accumulated holes at the hole-transport layer/electron-transport layer
   interface have enhanced the electric field in the electron-transport
   layer and improved the electron injection at the cathode. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Background. Control of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses is
   a major public-health concern. Antiviral drugs could be the only option
   early in the pandemic.
   Methods. BALB/c mice were given oseltamivir (0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg/day)
   twice daily by oral gavage; the first dose was given 4 h before
   inoculation with H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN1203/04) virus. Five- and
   8-day regimens were evaluated.
   Results. Oseltamivir produced a dose-dependent antiviral effect against
   VN1203/04 in vivo (P < .01). The 5-day regimen at 10 mg/kg/day protected
   50\% of mice; deaths in this treatment group were delayed and indicated
   the replication of residual virus after the completion of treatment.
   Eight-day regimens improved oseltamivir efficacy, and dosages of 1 and
   10 mg/kg/day significantly reduced virus titers in organs and provided
   60\% and 80\% survival rates, respectively. Overall, the efficacy of the
   5- and 8-day regimens differed significantly (death hazard ratio, P <
   .05 2.658;). The new H5N1 antigenic variant VN1203/04 was more
   pathogenic in mice than was A/HK/156/97 P < .01 virus, and a prolonged
   and higher-dose oseltamivir regimen may be required for the most
   beneficial antiviral effect.
   Conclusions. Oseltamivir prophylaxis is efficacious against lethal
   challenge with VN1203/04 virus in mice. Viral virulence may affect the
   antiviral treatment schedule.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the fundamental role that chaosity and randomness play in the
   determination of quality and efficiency of medical treatment. The
   statistical parameter of non-Markovity from non-equilibrium statistical
   physics of condensed matters is offered as a quantitative information
   measure of chaosity and randomness. The role of chaosity and randomness
   is determined by the phenomenological property, which includes
   quantitative informational measures of chaosity and randomness and
   pathology (disease) in a covariant form. Manifestations of the
   statistical informational behavior of chaosity and randomness are
   examined while analyzing the chaotic dynamics of RR intervals from human
   ECG's, the electric signals of a human muscle's tremor of legs in a
   normal state and at Parkinson disease, the electric potentials of the
   human brain core from EEG's during epileptic seizure and a human hand
   finger tremor in Parkinson's disease. The existence of the above stated
   informational measure allows to introduce the quantitative factor of the
   quality of treatment. The above-stated examples confirm the existence of
   new phenomenological property, which is important not only for the
   decision of medical problems, but also for the analysis of the wide
   range of problems of physics of complex systems of life and lifeless
   nature. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Stable concentrated emulsions of methyl methacrylate/butyl acrylate were
   prepared with sodium dodecyl sulfate and cetyl alcohol as the compound
   surfactant and poly(vinyl alcohol) as the major reinforcer of the liquid
   film. With a redox system based on benzoyl peroxide/N,N'-dimethyl
   phenylamine introduced into the concentrated emulsions, polymer
   particles with different shapes and sizes were obtained by initiation of
   the polymerization at low temperatures. We investigated the kinetic
   behaviors of concentrated emulsion polymerization and drew linear
   regression diagrams of its time-conversion curves in a constant rate
   phase (conversions ranged from 20 to 70\%), and the experimental results
   show that the variation of the concentrations of the compound surfactant
   and initiator, the categories of reinforcers of the liquid film, the
   temperatures, and so on were responsible for the polymerization
   stability and the polymerization rate. Finally, the kinetics equation
   and activation energy of the initiator were obtained. The particle size
   and distribution of particle diameters of latex particles were
   determined by photon correlation spectroscopy. The determination results
   reveal that concentrations of the compound surfactant, polymerization

Abstract = {{The GaN epitaxial layer was grown by hydride vapor-phase epitaxy (HVPE)

   dislocation density in the GaN layer was similar to 9 x 10(9)/cm(2). The
   full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values of the X-ray rocking curve for
   GaN (0 0 0 2) and (1 0 1 2) were 13.7 and 35.3 arcmin, respectively. The
   PL spectra of our sample exhibited a predominant band-edge emission of
   the wurzite GaN epilayer near 3.36 eV with FWHM = 64.2 meV at 50 K and
   76.5 meV at room temperature. The experimental data indicated that the

Abstract = {{Early, active multiple sclerosis lesions show four immunopathological
   patterns of demyelination. Although these patterns differ between
   patients, multiple active lesions from a given patient have an identical
   pattern, which suggests pathogenic heterogeneity. Therapeutic plasma
   exchange (TPE) has been successfully used to treat fulminant
   demyelinating attacks unresponsive to steroids. We postulated that
   patients with pattern II would be more likely to improve after TPE than
   those with other patterns since pattern II lesions are distinguished by
   prominent immunoglobulin deposition and complement activation. We
   retrospectively studied 19 patients treated with TPE for an attack of
   fulminant CNS inflammatory demyelinating disease. All patients with
   pattern II (n=10), but none with pattern I (n=3) or pattern III (n=6),
   achieved moderate to substantial functional neurological improvement
   after TPE (p<0.0001). Patients with multiple sclerosis with pattern II
   pathology are more likely to respond favourably to TPE than are patients
   with patterns I or III.}},

Abstract = {{The rat thalamic nucleus submedius responds to noxious pressure stimuli
   in the colon. Some neurons in and near Barrington's nucleus, a pontine
   center related to bladder function, also respond to colon distension. We
   hypothesized that colonic nociception may be relayed via Barrington's
   nucleus to the nucleus submedius. Experiments were carried out in 22
   urethane-anesthetized male rats. Noxious stimuli were applied to the
   toes using standardized clips and to the colon by inflation of the
   balloon to 80 mmHg for 30 s using a barostat. The brain was exposed to
   allow recording from the nucleus submedius with a monopolar tungsten
   electrode and the activity of rectus muscle was assessed via silver wire
   electrodes. A glass pipette was inserted into Barrington's nucleus for
   injection of 5 mM CoCl2, a temporary neural blocker. The site of CoCl2
   injection was confirmed by the presence of FluoroGold which was
   incorporated into the CoCl2 solution. We recorded 51 units in submedius
   that were excited by noxious toe pinch, 4 were inhibited. Colon
   distension to 80 mmHg produced visceromotor responses, excited 23 units
   in submedius and inhibited 13 units. Injection of CoCl2 into the region
   of Barrington's nucleus blocked the response to colon distension in 10
   of 12 Sm units tested, but had no influence on the accompanying
   visceromotor response. These data point to a previously unrecognized
   relationship between Barrington's nucleus and submedius that may
   subserve colon nociception. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We consider the optimal cloning of quantum coherent states with

Abstract = {{The interaction between calmodulin (CaM) and Al3+ was studied by
   spectroscopic methods. Heteronuclear two-dimensional NMR data indicated
   that peaks related to the both lobes and middle of the central helix of
   CaM are largely affected by Al3+. But chemical shift perturbation
   suggested that overall conformation of Ca2+-loaded CaM is not changed by
   Al3+ binding. It is thought that Al3+ interaction to the middle of the
   central helix is a key for the property of CaM's target recognition. If
   the structure and/or flexibility of the central helix are/is changed by
   Al3+, target affinity to CaM must be influenced by Al3+. Thus, we
   performed surface plasmon resonance experiments to observe the effect of
   Al3+ on the target recognition by CaM. The data clearly indicated that
   target affinity to CaM is reduced by addition of Al3+. All the results
   presented here support a hypothesis that Al3+ may affect on the Ca2+

Abstract = {{Osterix (Osx) is a transcription factor required for the differentiation

   activation during these processes in osteoblasts differentiating from
   murine and human embryonic stem cells (ESC). To do this, we constructed
   an Osx-GFP fusion protein reporter system to track Osx translocation
   within the cells. The distribution of Osx-GFP at representative stages
   of differentiation was also investigated by screening primary
   osteoblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, synoviocytes, and pre-adipocytes.
   Our experiments revealed that Osx-GFP protein was detectable in the
   cytoplasm of cultured, differentiated ESC 4 days after plating of
   enzymatically dispersed embryoid bodies. Osterix-GFP protein became
   translocated into the nucleus on day 7 following transfer of
   differentiated ESC to osteogenic medium. After 14 days of
   differentiation, cells showing nuclear translocation of Osx-GFP formed
   rudimentary bone nodules that continued to increase in number over the
   following weeks (through day 21). We also found that Osx translocated
   into the nuclei of mesenchymal stem cells (C3H10T1/2) and
   pre-osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) and showed partial activation in
   pre-adipocytes (MC3T3-L1). These data suggest that Osx activation occurs
   at a very early point in the differentiation of the
   mesenchymal-osteoblastic lineage. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{While proteasome is central to the degradation of cellular ubiquitinated
   proteins, the control of its nuclear function is barely understood. Here
   we show that the fission yeast ubiquitin-conjugating Rhp6/Ubc2/Rad6 and
   ligating enzymes Ubr1 are responsible for nuclear enrichment of
   proteasome through the function of Cut8, a nuclear envelope protein.
   Cut8 is an Rhp6 substrate that physically interacts with and tethers
   proteasome. Nonubiquitinatable K-all-R Cut8 weakly interacts with
   proteasome and fails to enrich nuclear proteasome. Consistently, the
   nuclear enrichment of proteasome also falls in rhp6 and ubr1 null
   mutants. Further, cut8 null and cut8 K-all-R mutants are hypersensitive
   to DNA damage, probably due to the paucity of nuclear proteasome. Thus,
   Rhp6 enhances the retention of nuclear proteasome through regulating
   Cut8. The short-lived nature of Cut8 is crucial for feedback enrichment
   of the proteasome within the nucleus. This is likely to be a conserved
   mechanism as we describe a Cut8 homolog in flies.}},

Abstract = {{Research on stem-cell transplantation has indicated that the success of
   transplantation largely depends on synchronizing donor cells into the
   G0/G1 phase. In this study, we investigated the profile of embryonic
   stem (ES) cell synchronization and its effect on the formation of
   embryonic bodies (EBs) using cell culture with serum deprivation. The D3
   cell line of ES cells was used, and parameters such as cell
   proliferation and activity, EB formation, and expression of
   stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 and Oct-4 were investigated. Results
   showed that the percentage of G0/G1 stage in serum deprivation culture
   is significantly higher than that in culture with serum supplementation.
   Synchronized ES cells can reenter the normal cell cycle successfully
   after serum supply. EBs formed from synchronized ES cells have higher
   totipotency capability to differentiate into functional neuronal cells
   than EBs formed from unsynchronized ES cells. Our study provides a
   method for ES treatment before cell transplantation that possibly helps
   to decrease the rate of cell death after transplantation. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{In Synchrotron stereotactic radiotherapy (SSR) the tumor is loaded with
   atoms of high atomic number (Z) element, and exposed to monochromatic
   X-rays from a synchrotron source (50-100 keV), in stereotactic
   conditions. This method is under investigation at the European
   Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) for the treatment of brain tumors.
   Conventional treatment planning systems are not suitable for SSR since
   the beam energy, the irradiation geometry and the presence of high Z
   elements differ from commercial systems. Therefore, SSR requires the
   development of new procedures for the evaluation of dose maps. Monte
   Carlo (MC) method offers the potential of calculating the dose in
   complicated geometries, made of heterogeneous materials. MC calculations
   were performed using the MCNP4C general purpose code. Gel dosimetry
   allows accurate experimental verification of three-dimensional absorbed
   dose distributions from any irradiation geometries. In this study, the
   Fricke chemical dosimeter was employed for it is easy to prepare without
   special facilities. Various phantoms filled with Fricke gel were
   irradiated in SSR configuration. The dose profiles obtained were
   compared with MC simulations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   process. The aim of this work is to demonstrate and verify the
   feasibility of a compact and programmable image compression sub-system
   that uses just one low-cost FPGA device. The entire system consumes just
   1637 slices of an XC2V chip, it runs at 100 MHz clock frequency and

Abstract = {{Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is the most commonly mutated gene in
   benign tumors of the human nervous system such as schwannomas and
   meningiomas. The NF2 gene encodes a protein called schwannomin or
   merlin, which is involved in regulating cell growth and proliferation
   through protein-protein interactions with various cellular proteins. In
   order to better understand the mechanism by which merlin exerts its
   function, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed and Ral guanine
   nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS), a downstream molecule of
   Ras, was identified as a merlin-binding protein. The direct interaction
   between merlin and RalGDS was confirmed both in vitro and in the NIH3T3
   cells. The domain analyses revealed that the broad C-terminal region of
   merlin (aa 141-595) is necessary for the interaction with the C-terminal
   Ras-binding domain (RBD) of RalGDS. Functional studies showed that
   merlin inhibits the RalGDS-induced RalA activation, the colony formation
   and the cell migration in mammalian cells. These results suggest that
   merlin can function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the
   RalGDS-mediated oncogenic signals.}},

Abstract = {{We present evidence that Notch4ICD attenuates TGF-beta signaling. Cells
   expressing the activated form of the Notch4 receptor (ICD4) were
   resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. Notch4ICD was
   found to bind to Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 but with higher affinity to
   Smad3. Deletion analysis showed that binding of Smad3 to ICD4 was
   mediated by its MH2 domain and was not dependent on the presence of the
   RAM23 region in ICD4. Using two TGF-beta/Activin reporter luciferase
   assays, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, we demonstrate that ICD4 and
   ICD4 delta RAM23 inhibit Smad-binding element and 3TP luciferase
   reporter activity and PAI-1 gene expression. MCF-7 human breast cancer
   cells express Notch4ICD (ICD4) and are resistant to the
   growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. Blockage of Notch4 processing to
   ICD4 by gamma-secretase inhibitor renders MCF-7 cells sensitive to
   growth inhibition by TGF-beta. The interplay between these two signaling
   pathways may be a significant determinant during mammary tumorigenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular, local, and organismal responses to low O-2 availability occur
   during processes such as anaerobic metabolism and wound healing and
   pathological conditions such as stroke and cancer. These responses
   include increases in glycolytic activity, vascularization, breathing,
   and red blood cell production. These responses are mediated in part by
   the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which receive information on O-2
   levels from a group of iron- and O-2-dependent hydroxylases. Hypoxia
   mimics, such as cobalt chloride, nickel chloride, and deferoxamine, act
   to simulate hypoxia by altering the iron status of these hydroxylases.
   To determine whether these mimics are appropriate substitutes for the
   lower O-2 tension evoked naturally, we compared transcriptional
   responses of a Hep3B cell line using high-density oligonucleotide
   arrays. A battery of core genes was identified that was shared by all
   four treatments ( hypoxia, cobalt, nickel, and deferoxamine) including
   glycolytic enzymes, cell cycle regulators, and apoptotic genes.
   Importantly, cobalt, nickel, and deferoxamine influenced transcription
   of distinct sets of genes that were not affected by cellular hypoxia.
   These global responses to hypoxia indicate a balancing act between
   adaptation and programmed cell death and suggest caution in the use of
   hypoxia mimics as substitutes for the low O-2 tension that occurs in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to
   investigate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a Pt(I 11) surface at
   350 K. By progressive loading of (H3O)1(H2O)2,3 + e(-) into a simulation
   cell containing a Pt slab and O-2 for the first reduction step, and
   either products or intermediate species for the subsequent reduction
   steps, the detailed mechanisms of the ORR are well illustrated via
   monitoring MD trajectories and analyzing Kohn-Sham electronic energies.
   A proton transfer is found to be involved in the first reduction step;
   depending on the initial proton-oxygen distance, on the degree of proton
   hydration, and on the surface charge, such transfer may take place
   either earlier or later than the O-2 chemisorption, in all cases forming
   an adsorbed end-on complex H-O-O{*}. Decomposition of H-O-O{*} takes
   place with a rather small barrier, after a short lifetime of
   approximately 0.15 ps, yielding coadsorbed oxygen and hydroxyl (O{*} +
   HO{*}). Formation of the one-end adsorbed hydrogen peroxide, HOO{*}H, is
   observed via the reduction of H-O-O{*}, which suggests that the ORR may
   also proceed via HOO{*}H, i.e., a series pathway. However, HOO{*}H
   readily dissociates homolytically into two coadsorbed hydroxyls (HO{*} +
   HO{*}) rather than forming a dual adsorbed HOOH. Along the direct
   pathway, the reduction of H-O{*} + O{*} yields two possible products,
   O{*} + H2O{*} and HO{*} + HO{*}. Of the three intermediates from the
   second electron-transfer step, HOO{*}H from the series pathway has the
   highest energy, followed by O{*} + H2O{*} and HO{*} + HO{*} from the
   direct pathway. It is therefore theoretically validated that the O-2
   reduction on a Pt surface may proceed via a parallel pathway, the direct

Abstract = {{Addition and elimination interaction of thiyl radicals with the C5-C6
   double bond in pyrimidines was studied by the pulse radiolysis technique
   in aqueous solution with the use of different monitoring systems. For
   this purpose, p-thiocresol, cysteamine hydrochloride, and
   mercaptoethanol were used. The rate constants of addition and
   elimination of thiyl radicals were determined by applying the modified
   version of ACUCHEM (computer program for modeling complex reaction
   systems). Aliphatic thiyl radicals add to the pyrimidine C5-C6 double
   bond with k = 1.0-3.0 x 10(7) dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1), whereas elimination
   takes place with k = 0.7-2.0 x 10(5) s(-1). Quantum chemical
   calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/PCM level show that the addition
   should occur at the C6 position of the pyrimidine ring and that the

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the robust H-infinity control problem for a class
   of discrete-time fuzzy systems with uncertainty. The uncertainty is
   assumed to be of structured linear fractional form. By using
   basis-dependent Lyapunov function, an H-infinity control design approach
   is developed. The control design approach is facilitated by introducing
   some additional instrumental matrix variables. These additional matrix
   variables decouple the Lyapunov and the system matrices, which makes the
   control design feasible. The proposed approach leads to some sufficient
   results in the form of strict linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is
   expected that the basis-dependent results are less conservative than the
   basis-independent ones due to the introduction of basis-dependent
   Lyapunov function. Finally, numerical examples including the discrete
   chaotic Lorenz system are also given to demonstrate the applicability of
   the proposed approach. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{373-382}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Despite observational evidence for cold neutral astrophysical accretion
   disks, the viscous process that may drive the accretion in such systems
   is not yet understood. While molecular viscosity is too small to explain
   the observed accretion efficiencies by more than 10 orders of magnitude,
   the absence of any linear instability in Keplerian accretion flows is
   often used to rule out the possibility of turbulent viscosity. Recently,
   the fact that some fine-tuned disturbances of any inviscid shear flow
   can reach arbitrarily large transient growth has been proposed as an
   alternative route to turbulence in these systems. We present an analytic
   study of this process for three-dimensional plane wave disturbances of a
   general rotating shear flow in Lagrangian coordinates and demonstrate
   that large transient growth is a generic feature of nonaxisymmetric
   disturbances with near radial leading wavevectors. The maximum energy
   growth is slower than quadratic but faster than linear in time. The
   fastest growth occurs for two-dimensional perturbations and is only
   limited by viscosity, and ultimately by the disk vertical thickness.
   After including viscosity and vertical structure, we find that, as a
   function of the Reynolds number R, the maximum energy growth is
   approximately 0.4(R/ log R)(2/3) and put forth a heuristic argument for
   why R greater than or similar to 10(4) is required to sustain turbulence
   in Keplerian disks. Therefore, assuming that there exists a nonlinear
   feedback process to replenish the seeds for transient growth,
   astrophysical accretion disks must be well within the turbulent regime.
   However, large three-dimensional numerical simulations running for many
   orbital times, and/or with fine-tuned initial conditions, are required
   to confirm Keplerian hydrodynamic turbulence on the computer.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline, nanostructured, defective tin oxide particles and
   electrodes (supported on Ti) were prepared by a common synthetic path.
   The electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and impedance
   spectroscopy in a potential range, purportedly selected to exclude the
   hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions as well as any other faradaic
   reaction involving the massive reduction of SnO2. Parallel particle
   characterization was performed by BET and electrophoretic mobility. A
   synergistic enhancement of the descriptive capability of each
   investigation technique is obtained. In particular, the semiconducting
   properties of the Ti/SnO2 electrodes are obtained and discussed in term
   of emptying/filling of the electronic traps within the band gap that is
   in terms of oxide resistance and electron trapping capacitance. In
   addition the voltammetric total, outer and inner charge quantities,
   Q(tot), Q(out) and Q(in), are determined and interpreted in terms of
   ``electrochemical{''} porosity of the oxide layer. The outcomes are in
   total agreement with the BET investigations of the powder. The electric
   surface characteristics are parallelly investigated by the pH dependence
   of the oxide/solution capacitance of the electrodes and by the
   electrophoretic mobility of the particles. The results jointly point to
   a substantial reduction of charge accumulation capability at pH > 5-6,
   where a net negative charge is observed on the surface. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is a major component of river waters
   and is derived from atmospheric CO2, from reactions for silicate and
   carbonate rock weathering and biological activities such as
   photosynthesis and respiration. To distinguish the sources of HCO3- in
   river waters, it is essential to estimate the amount of CO2 consumed
   from the atmosphere during rock weathering and to understand the
   biogeochemical cycling of carbon. One of the more reliable methods
   adopted to understand the different sources of DIC in rivers, is the
   measurements of carbon isotopes in DIC, since the fractionation factors
   between the different carbonate species in dissolved river water and
   gaseous CO2 are well established. The present study is aimed at
   understanding the source of DIC in the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers
   in the Himalayas by measurements of C-delta 13(DIC) in water samples.
   From the measurements made on these rivers in India through the present
   study, we find that the river waters have highly depleted C-delta

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{536}},
Pages = {{377-400}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{The effect of angle of attack on the acoustic receptivity of the
   boundary layer over two-dimensional parabolic bodies is investigated
   using a spatial solution of the Navier Stokes equations. The free stream
   is decomposed into a uniform flow with a superposed periodic velocity
   fluctuation of small amplitude. The method follows that of Haddad \&
   Corke (1998) and Erturk \& Corke (2001) in which the solution for the
   basic flow and linearized perturbation flow are solved separately.
   Different angles of incidence of the body are investigated for three
   leading-edge radii Reynolds numbers. For each, the angle of attack
   ranges from 0 degrees to past the angle where the mean flow separates.
   The results then document the effect of the angle of incidence on the
   leading-edge receptivity coefficient (K-LE), and in the case of the mean
   flow separation, on the amplitude of Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves at
   the linear stability Branch II location (K-II). For angles of attack
   before separation, we found that the leading-edge receptivity
   coefficient, KLE, increased with angle of incidence which correlated
   with an increase in the pressure gradient at the physical leading edge.
   When a separation zone formed at larger angles of incidence, it became a
   second site of receptivity with a receptivity coefficient that exceeded

Abstract = {{An algorithm is developed to model the three-dimensional velocity
   distribution function of a sample of stars using only measurements of
   each star's two-dimensional tangential velocity. The algorithm works
   with ``missing data{''}: it reconstructs the three-dimensional
   distribution from data (velocity measurements) that all have one
   dimension that is unmeasured (the radial direction). It also accounts
   for covariant measurement uncertainties on the tangential velocity
   components. The algorithm is applied to tangential velocities measured
   in a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865 stars taken from the
   Hipparcos catalog, chosen to lie on the main sequence and have
   well-measured parallaxes. The local stellar velocity distribution
   function of each of a set of 20 color-selected subsamples is modeled as
   a mixture of two three-dimensional Gaussian ellipsoids of arbitrary
   relative responsibility. In the fitting, one Gaussian (the ``halo{''})
   is fixed at the known mean velocity and velocity variance tensor of the
   Galaxy halo, and the other (the ``disk{''}) is allowed to take an
   arbitrary mean and an arbitrary variance tensor. The mean and variance
   tensors (commonly known as the ``velocity ellipsoid{''}) of the disk
   velocity distribution are both found to be strong functions of stellar
   color, with long-lived populations showing larger velocity dispersion,
   slower mean rotation velocity, and smaller vertex deviation than
   short-lived populations. The local standard of rest (LSR) is inferred in
   the usual way, and the Sun's motion relative to the LSR is found to be
   (U, V, W)(circle dot) (10.1, 4.0, 6.7) +/- (0.5, 0.8, 0.2) km s(-1).
   Artificial data sets are made and analyzed, with the same error
   properties as the Hipparcos data, to demonstrate that the analysis is
   unbiased. The results are shown to be insensitive to the assumption that
   the velocity distributions are Gaussian.}},

Title = {{How to enhance ipsilateral actions of pyramidal tract neurons}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{7401-7405}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{We have shown previously that ipsilateral pyramidal tract (PT) neurons
   facilitate the actions of reticulospinal neurons on feline motoneurons
   (Edgley et al., 2004), which indicates that they might assist the
   recovery of motor functions after injuries of contralateral
   corticospinal neurons. Nevertheless, stimulation of ipsilateral PT
   fibers alone only rarely evoked any synaptic actions in motoneurons. The
   aim of this study was to investigate possible ways of enhancing such
   actions and of inducing more effective excitation and inhibition of
   motoneurons. The effects of stimulation of the ipsilateral PT were
   investigated after eliminating the spinal actions of contralateral PT
   fibers by hemisecting the spinal cord at a low thoracic level and were
   estimated from intracellular records from hindlimb motoneurons. Two
   measures were used to enhance PT actions. The first was to increase the
   probability of activation of reticulospinal neurons by mutual
   facilitation of actions of ipsilateral and contralateral PT neurons. The
   second was to enhance synaptic transmission between PT neurons and
   reticulospinal neurons, and in pathways between the reticulospinal
   neurons and motoneurons via commissural interneurons, by systemic
   application of a K+ channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). The results
   show that under favorable conditions, ipsilateral PT neurons may induce
   EPSPs and IPSPs in hindlimb motoneurons, or even action potentials, via
   the reticulospinal pathway. This study strengthens previous conclusions
   that ipsilateral PT neurons can potentially replace, at least to some
   extent, the actions of injured contralateral PT neurons. It also
   suggests that 4-AP might improve the progress of the recovery.}},

Abstract = {{The enantiomers of five chiral pesticides of environmental interest,
   metalaxyl, imazaquin, fonofos (dyfonate), ruelene (cruformate), and
   dichlorprop, were separated analytically using capillary electrophoresis
   (CE) with cyclodextrin chiral selectors. For metalaxyl, imazaquin, and
   fonofos, aqueous slurries of soil samples from two sites in Georgia and
   one in Ohio were spiked with the racemate of each pesticide at 50-60
   mg/L of aqueous phase of the slurry, and CE analyses were performed at
   various time intervals to determine enantiomer fractions (EF). Metalaxyl
   underwent enantioselective transformation; in one soil, the half-life of
   the target active R-(+)-enantiomer was 17 days while that for the
   S-(-)-enantiomer was 69 days. Transformation occurred more slowly in the
   other two soils but was still selective for the R-(+)-enantiomer.
   Imazaquin and fonofos exhibited nonselective enantiomer loss over their
   3 months of incubation time; this could have been due to abiotic or
   nonselective microbial reactions. Ruelene and dichlorprop were
   transformed selectively in a variety of soils in a previously reported
   study (7) that showed the influence of environmental changes on the
   transformation of chiral pollutants in soils; analytical methods used in
   that study are reported here to further illustrate the application of
   CE. CE is shown to be a simple, efficient, and inexpensive way to follow
   the transformation of chiral pesticides in laboratory microcosms where
   concentrations can be made high enough (25-50 mg/L initial racemate
   concentration) for detection of residual parent enantiomers during most
   of the process.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation indices have been widely used as indicators of seasonal and
   inter-annual variations in vegetation caused by either human activities
   or climate, with the overall goal of observing and documenting changes
   in the Earth system. While existing satellite remote sensing systems,
   such as NASA's Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), are providing improved
   vegetation index data products through correcting for the distortions in
   surface reflectance caused by atmospheric particles as well as ground
   covers below vegetation canopy, the impact of land-cover mixing on
   vegetation indices has not been fully addressed. In this study, based on
   real image spectral samples for two-component mixtures of forest and
   common nonforest land-cover types directly extracted from a 1.1 km MISR
   image by referencing a 30 in land-cover classification, the effect of
   land-cover mixing on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
   and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) has been quantitatively
   evaluated. When the areal fraction of forest was lower than 80\%, both
   NDVI and EVI varied greatly with mixed land-cover types, although EVI
   varied less than NDVI. Such a phenomenon can cause errors in
   applications based on use of these vegetation indices. This study
   suggests that methods that reduce land-cover mixing effects should be
   introduced when developing new spectral vegetation indices.}},

Title = {{K-means clustering for optimal partitioning and dynamic load balancing

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{207}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{493-528}},

Abstract = {{A number of complex physical problems can be approached through N-body
   simulation, from fluid flow at high Reynolds number to gravitational
   astrophysics and molecular dynamics. In all these applications, direct
   summation is prohibitively expensive for large N and thus hierarchical
   methods are employed for fast summation. This work introduces new
   algorithms, based on k-means clustering, for partitioning parallel
   hierarchical N-body interactions. We demonstrate that the number of
   particle-cluster interactions and the order at which they are performed
   are directly affected by partition geometry. Weighted k-means partitions
   minimize the sum of clusters' second moments and create well-localized
   domains, and thus reduce the computational cost of N-body approximations
   by enabling the use of lowerolder approximations and fewer cells.
   We also introduce compatible techniques for dynamic load balancing,
   including adaptive scaling of cluster volumes and adaptive
   redistribution of cluster centroids. We demonstrate the performance of
   these algorithms by constructing a parallel treecode for vortex particle
   simulations, based oil the serial variable-order Cartesian code
   developed by Lindsay and Krasny {[}Journal of Computational Physics 172
   (2) (2001) 879-907]. The method is applied to vortex simulations of a
   transverse jet. Results show outstanding parallel efficiencies even at
   high concurrencies, with velocity evaluation errors maintained at or
   below their serial values; on a realistic distribution of 1.2 million
   vortex particles, we observe a parallel efficiency of 98\% on 1024
   processors. Excellent load balance is achieved even in the face of
   several obstacles, such as an irregular, time-evolving particle
   distribution containing a range of length scales and the continual
   introduction of new vortex particles throughout the domain. Moreover,
   results suggest that k-means yields a more efficient partition of the
   domain than a global oct-tree. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{We propose an alternative formulation for creating the optimized virtual
   orbital space ( OVOS). Our technique exploits and extends the method
   developed by Adamowicz and co-workers {[} L. Adamowicz, R. J. Bartlett.
   J. chem. Phys., 86, 6314 ( 1987); L. Adamowicz, R. J. Bartlett, A. J.
   Sadlej. J. chem. Phys., 88, 5749 ( 1988).]. The aim of the OVOS
   technique is to reduce the original SCF basis of the virtual molecular
   orbitals and to reduce the computer time in the coupled cluster ( CC)
   and related highly sophisticated correlated methods. OVOS is created by
   using an invariant unitary rotation of the virtual orbitals subspace.
   New optimization functionals are proposed and implemented. The. first
   type are `energy' functionals. Their optimization leads to the minimal
   difference between the CCSD, CCD, or the second-order perturbation
   energy, MP2, in the original orbital basis and the OVOS basis,
   respectively. Alternatively, linearized `overlap' functionals optimize
   the overlap between the correlated wave function in the full and the
   OVOS space, respectively. The original exponential parametrization was
   replaced by the efficient algorithm for the virtual orbital subspace
   rotation based on the Lagrangian multipliers technique which ensures
   orthogonality within rotated virtual orbitals.
   The method is illustrated by calculations of correlation energies and/
   or reaction energies, spectroscopic constants or dipole moments of HF,
   HCN, HNC, CO and F-2 molecules and dissociation energies of pentane to
   propene and ethane. The `overlap' functional is shown to be more
   effcient than the `energy' one, particularly in representing triple
   excitations using OVOS. The basis set dependence of the efficiency of
   the OVOS technique was also studied.}},

Abstract = {{Definition of both quality and quantity of energy consumption of crops
   by recently developed remote sensing methods has been an important
   factor in the control of sustainable bioenergy production in terms of
   food security. This study was conducted to find the critical
   physiological stages of orange trees from their energy supply and energy
   balances using remote sensing methods. The relationships between
   absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and chlorophyll
   content (chl) of the leaves at different growth stages were
   investigated. Canopy reflectance by hand-held spectroradiometer and
   total chl analysis at the laboratory were measured simultaneously from
   the random samples taken from four different parts of orange trees in
   orchards, each orchard being at a different age group. Reflectance
   measurements were conducted between 450nm and 900nm wavelength at four
   different bands (three visible bands and one near-infrared band) at the
   four basic physiological periods of orange trees. Reflectance values
   measured in the field were converted to APAR (WM-2) and the chi values
   were determined in mg ml(-1). According to the statistical analysis,
   there was a strong relationship between APAR at the bands of 450-520 nm
   (blue) and 630-690 nm (red) and the chlorophyll content (p <= 0. 0 1;
   R-2 = 0.750 at blue wavelength and R-2 = 0.770 at red wavelength) in
   June (fruit setting stage). These results showed that the relationships
   between chi and APAR values were very strong despite low levels of APAR
   at this stage, in comparison to the other ones. Amongst all the stages,
   APAR values were the highest in November. Another important result was
   that Washington navel trees unexpectedly had the highest APAR during the
   dormancy stage. These results suggested that the relationships between
   PAR utilization and chlorophyll content were important for tree health
   and indirect yield of per annum plants such as citrus. The values
   obtained from the leaves of orange trees at different physiological
   periods were more important than those relationships for the trees of
   different ages.}},

Abstract = {{Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) contains isoflavones that are of
   interest because of their benefits for human health as well as their
   adverse effects on the fertility of farm animals. A series of field
   experiments was conducted in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC, Canada, to
   determine the effects of the environment, cultivar, plant maturity,
   plant part, and preservation method on the concentration of the two
   predominant isoflavones in red clover, formononetin and biochanin A. In
   a multi-year, multisite trial, the total isoflavone concentration in 10
   cultivars ranged between 8923 and 12 753 mu g g(-1) of DM averaged
   across sites, harvests, and years. Despite strong environmental effects,
   the cultivar ``Start{''} consistently had the lowest isoflavone
   concentrations, with few differences observed among other cultivars.
   Across stages of maturity, leaves were found to have the highest
   isoflavone concentration followed by stems and inflorescences (11 970,
   4896, and 3297 mu g g(-1) of DM respectively). Changes in isoflavone
   concentrations with increasing maturity varied depending on the plant
   part. Overall, highest isoflavone concentrations were found in leaves
   and stems during the vegetative stages, with the formononetin
   concentration declining until plants initiated flowering, especially in
   stems, with concentrations then stabilized in both parts. Upon
   initiation, inflorescences contained similar isoflavone concentrations
   than leaves, but concentrations decreased rapidly during flower
   development to fall even below those observed in stems. Inflorescences
   then had isoflavone concentrations that were as much as 11 times lower
   than leaves. Fresh herbage contained higher formononetin and total
   isoflavone concentrations than did silage and hay (114 464, 12 200, and
   11 604 mu g g(-1) of DM, respectively). The isoflavone concentration in
   field-grown red clover is thus high but can be affected by a range of
   agronomic factors.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{629}},
Number = {{1, 1}},
Pages = {{52-60}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we extend our approach to modeling multifrequency emission
   variability from blazars to include external radiation Compton (ERC)
   emission and electron energy losses from inverse Compton scattering of
   seed photons originating outside the jet. We consider seed photon
   emission from a dusty molecular torus and the broad-line region (BLR)
   surrounding the central engine. We establish constraints on the
   properties of the molecular torus and BLR under which synchrotron
   self-Compton (SSC) emission dominates such that the results obtained in
   our previous paper are applicable. The focus of this study is on
   relative time delays between the light curves observed at different
   frequencies. For definiteness, we consider emission resulting from a
   collision between relativistic shocks, but the results apply more
   generally to conditions involving acceleration of relativistic electrons
   and/or magnetic field amplification at any type of front. Unlike SSC
   emission, ERC flares involving a constant field of seed photons are not
   delayed by light-travel time of the seed photons. The main cause of
   delays is from radiative energy losses, which result in frequency
   stratification behind the front and quench the flare first at the
   highest frequencies, then progressing to lower frequencies as time
   advances. However, if the spectrum of electrons injected at the shock
   front is characterized by a relatively high value of the minimum energy
   (a Lorentz factor gamma(min) similar to 100 is sufficient), the ERC
   flare in the X-ray band can be delayed and may even peak after the
   injection has ceased. This effect is strongly frequency dependent, with
   a longer lag at lower frequencies and an X-ray spectral index that
   changes rapidly from positive (inverted spectrum) to steep values.}},

   Electrical and thermoelectric properties of these electrodeposited

   In-plane electrical resistivity was highly dependent on composition and
   microstructure. In-plane Hall mobility decreased with increasing carrier
   concentration, while the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient increased
   with increasing electrical conductivity to a maximum of -188.5 mu V/K.

Abstract = {{Titanium dioxide/carbon nanotubes (TiO2/CNTs) composites were prepared
   with the aid of ultrasonic irradiation. Products of different TiO2:CNTs
   molar ratio were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman
   spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption analysis,
   thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TGA-DSC),
   photoluminescence (PL) and UV-vis spectroscopy measurements (UV-vis).
   The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the degradation of acetone
   and by the detection of the hydroxyl radical (-OH) signals using
   electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), It is found that the crystalline
   TiO2 is Composed of both anatase and brookite phases. The agglomerated
   morphology and the particle size of TiO2 in the composites change in the
   presence of CNTs. The CNTs in the composites are virtually all covered
   by TiO2. Other than an increase of the surface area, the addition of
   CNTs does not affect the mesoporous nature of the TiO2. Meanwhile, more
   hydroxyl groups are available on the surface of the composite than in
   the case of the pure TiO2. The higher the content of CNTs, there is more
   effective in the suppression of the recombination of photo-generated
   e(-)/h(+) pairs. However, excessive CNTs also shield the TiO2 from
   absorbing UV light. The optimal amount of TiO2 and CNTs is in the range
   of 1:0.1 and 1:0.2 (feedstock molar ratio). These samples have much more
   highly photocatalytic activity than P25 and TiO2/activated carbon (AC)
   composite. The mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of
   TiO2 by CNTs is proposed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background - The identification of sites of dominant activation
   frequency during atrial fibrillation (AF) in humans and the effect of
   ablation at these sites have not been reported.
   Methods and Results -Thirty-two patients undergoing AF ablation ( 19
   paroxysmal, 13 permanent) during ongoing arrhythmia were studied.
   Electroanatomic mapping was performed, acquiring 126 +/- 13 points per
   patient throughout both atria and coronary sinus. At each point,
   5-second electrograms were obtained to determine the highest-amplitude
   frequency on spectral analysis and to construct 3D dominant frequency
   (DF) maps. The temporal stability of the recording interval was
   confirmed in a subset. Ablation was performed with the operator blinded
   to the DF maps. The effect of ablation at sites with or without
   high-frequency DF sites ( maximal frequencies surrounded by a decreasing
   frequency gradient >= 20\%) was evaluated by determining the change in
   AF cycle length (AFCL) and the termination and inducibility of AF. The
   spatial distribution of the DF sites was different in patients with
   paroxysmal and permanent AF; paroxysmal AF patients were more likely to
   harbor the DF site within the pulmonary vein, whereas in permanent AF,
   atrial DF sites were more prevalent. Ablation at a DF site resulted in
   significant prolongation of the AFCL ( 180 +/- 30 to 198 +/- 40 ms; P <
   0.0001; kappa = 0.77), whereas in the absence of a DF site, there was no
   change in AFCL ( 169 +/- 22 to 170 +/- 22 ms; P = 0.4). AF terminated
   during ablation in 17 of 19 patients with paroxysmal and 0 of 13 with
   permanent AF ( P < 0.0001). When 2 patients with nonsustained AF during
   mapping were excluded, 13 of 15 (87\%) had AF termination at DF sites (
   54\% at the initially ablated DF site): 11 pulmonary veins and 2 atrial.
   In addition, AF could no longer be induced in 69\% with termination of
   AF at a DF site. There were no significant differences in the number or
   percentage of DF sites detected ( 5.4 +/- 1.6 versus 4.9 +/- 2.1; P =
   0.3) and ablated ( 1.9 +/- 1.0 versus 2.4 +/- 1.0; P = 0.3) in those
   with and without AF termination. The duration of radiofrequency ablation
   to achieve termination was significantly shorter than that delivered in
   those with persisting AF ( 34.8 +/- 24.0 versus 73.5 +/- 22.9 minutes; P
   = 0.0002). All patients with persisting AF had additional DF sites
   outside the ablated zones.
   Conclusions - Spectral analysis and frequency mapping identify localized
   sites of high-frequency activity during AF in humans with different
   distributions in paroxysmal and permanent AF. Ablation at these sites
   results in prolongation of the AFCL and termination of paroxysmal AF,
   indicating their role in the maintenance of AF.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{We introduce an alternative method for the retrieval of polarisation in
   the ultraviolet by the satellite spectrometer SCIAMACHY. Unlike the
   operational polarisation retrieval algorithm, this method does not use
   the Polarisation Measurement Devices (PMDs) onboard SCIAMACHY, but only
   requires the reflectance signal. This makes the algorithm more robust
   and less sensitive to calibration errors caused by either improper
   characterisation of the instrument's response functions ( key data) or
   degradation of the optical components.
   The alternative polarisation retrieval is able to retrieve the full
   state of atmospheric polarisation in the wavelength range between 330
   and 400 nm, which is essentially the wavelength region covered by
   SCIAMACHY's PMD 1. This allows a direct comparison with the current
   operational product.
   When we compare the alternative polarisation algorithm with the
   operational algorithm, we find in some cases agreement, but not in other
   cases. The alternative algorithm compares well with an analytical model
   of the polarisation of a cloud-free scene. Using the alternative
   algorithm the polarisation-sensitive feature in the SCIAMACHY
   reflectance around 350 nm is automatically corrected for.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in sources of renewable energy has led to increasing attention
   being paid to the potential of strong tidal currents. There is a limit
   to the available power, however, as too many turbines will merely block
   the flow, reducing the power generated. The maximum average power
   available from a tidal stream along a channel, such as that between an
   island and the mainland, is estimated and found to be typically
   considerably less than the average kinetic energy flux in the
   undisturbed state through the most constricted cross-section of the
   channel. A general formula gives the maximum average power as between 20
   and 24\% of the peak tidal pressure head, from one end of the channel to
   the other, times the peak of the undisturbed mass flux through the
   channel. This maximum average power is independent of the location of
   the turbine `fences' along the channel. The results may also be used to
   evaluate the power potential of steady ocean currents.}},

Abstract = {{High expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is thought to
   be correlated with cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, resistance
   to chemoradiotherapy, and poor prognosis in Various kinds of human
   cancers. Blockade of EGFR signal transduction can be a promising
   strategy for cancer therapy. Approximately 40-70\% of esophageal
   squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) show high expression of EGFR. In this
   study, we examined the antitumor effect of gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine
   kinase inhibitor, against ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. In three ESCC
   cell lines (TE8, T.T and T.Tn), cell proliferation had been inhibited in
   a dose-dependent manner and IC50 Values (respectively, 8.49, 18.9 and
   17.3 mu M). Gefitinib inhibited EGF-induced autophosphorylation of EGFR
   and its downstream signaling pathways, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt, and
   caused G(1) arrest of cell cycle and apoptosis confirmed with flow
   cytometry. We examined the effect of gefitinib on nude mice bearing
   established TE8 and T.T xenografts. Gefitimb (100 or 200 mg/kg
   once-daily, p.o.) showed antitumor activity in a dose-dependent manner,
   resulting in a significantly improved survival of treated mice as
   compared with untreated mice. Immunohistochemical examination of the
   harvested tumor was performed to examine the status of phosphorylated
   EGFR, PCNA, Factor VIII and apoptosis. We found inhibition of EGFR
   phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest (by PCNA staining), decrease of
   microvessel density (Factor VIII) and induction of apoptosis by TUNEL
   staining. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that gefitinib is
   effective for growth inhibition of ESCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo
   and suggest that gefitinib may be one of the new therapeutic options for
   ESSC. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Doublet electronic states of the H2S+ ion, within the C-s as well as
   C-2v symmetries, were studied using the CASSCF and CASPT2 methods in
   conjunction with an ANO basis. For the three lowest-lying C-2v (1(2)B(1)
   1(2)A(1) and 1(2)B(2)) states, the CAS (CASSCF and CASPT2) calculation
   results (geometries, frequencies, and adiabatic excitation energies
   (T-0)) are similar to those of the previous MRD-CI and MRCI
   calculations. We consider that the previous assignment of the B state to
   1(2)B(2) be inappropriate since the calculated T-o values for 1(2)B(2)
   are about 1 eV smaller than the experimental T-o value for the B state.
   The potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the three lowest-lying C-s
   (1(2)A{''}, 1(2)A', and 2(2)A') states were explored by locating and
   characterizing stationary points and by calculating minimum energy
   curves E(theta) (theta = angle HSH). In the 1(2)A `' PES there is a
   minimum M0. In the 1(2)A' PES, there are the global minimum M1, a local
   minimum M2, and a first-order saddle point TS connecting M1 and M2. M0,
   M1, and M2 are identified with the 1(2)B(1), 1(2)A(1), and 1(2)B(2) C-2v
   minima, respectively, while TS has a C-s geometry. The CASSCF and CASPT2
   geometries and CASSCF frequencies for M0 (1(2)A `') and M1 (1(2)A') are
   in reasonable agreement with the experimental data for the X and A
   states of the H2S+ ion, respectively. The CASPT2 relative energy value
   of 2.38 eV for M1 (to M0) is in good agreement with the experimental T-o
   value of 2.31 eV for the A state. We assign the A state to 1(2)A' (M1).
   The local minimum M2 in the 1(2)A' PES is not involved in any adiabatic
   excitation process of the H2S+ ion. In the 2(2)A' PES, a minimum M3 was
   located at a C-2v geometry at the CASPT2 level. The CASPT2 relative
   energy value of 4.19 eV for M3 (to M0) is quite close to the
   experimental T-o value of 4.31 eV for the B state, and we then assign
   the B state to 2(2)A' (M3). (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A study was undertaken to evaluate Saccharonzyces cerevisiae as a

   The effect of chemical and physical variables affecting the biosorption
   process was tested in order to select the optimal analytical conditions
   for the Cr retention by S. cerevisiae. Cr(III) was retained by the
   immobilised cells and Cr(VI) were retained by CPG. The speciation was
   possible by selective and sequential elution of Cr(III) with 0.05 mol
   L-1 HCl and 2.0 mol L-1 HNO3 for Cr(VI). The influence of some
   concomitant ions up to 20 mg L-1 was also tested. Quantitative
   determinations of Cr were carried out by means of inductively coupled
   plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). Preconcentration factors
   of 12 were achieved for Cr(III) and 5 for Cr(VI) when 1.7 mL of sample
   were processed reaching detection limits of 0.45 for Cr(III) and 1.5 mu

Abstract = {{We report, in this paper, the rate constants for electronic quenching of
   NO (D(2)Sigma(+), v' = 0) by gases He, Ar, Xe, NO, N-2, O-2, CO2, N2O,
   CF4, and SF6. The experiments were carried out by exciting the (0,0)
   band of the D(2)Sigma(+)-X(2)Pi transition at 187.5 nm, and detecting
   the (0,2) band fluorescence at 206 nm under various pressures of
   quenching gases. Based on the derived half quenching pressures and the
   known radiative lifetime of the excited state, the quenching rate
   constants were determined. Rate constants are all near gas kinetic and
   are in the following order: SF6 > CO2 > N2O > O-2 > NO > N-2 > Xe > CF4
   > He > Ar. Our rate constants are comparable with the existing
   literature data.
   For N-2, the resonant energy transfer between NO (D) and N2 was
   investigated. We observed quenching and enhanced fluorescence processes
   caused by the energy transfer between the excited states. Such pressure
   dependent processes could cause the disagreement among previous
   investigators. We also employed the collision complex model to derive
   the potential well depths of the van der Waals (vdw) complexes.
   Calculations were made by involving empirical kinetic data for the
   quenching gases as well as the experimental quenching cross-sections.
   Results show deep vdw potential wells for NO (D) with the gases studied
   here. Among all data, the potential well depths for noble gases are
   smaller compared with other reactive gases. The calculated results are
   then compared with the experimental well depths of NO(D)Ar. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{The four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water in multicopper oxidases
   takes place in a trinuclear copper cluster, which is linked to a
   mononuclear blue copper site, where the substrates are oxidized.
   Recently, several intermediates in the catalytic cycle have been
   spectroscopically characterized, and two possible structural models have
   been suggested for both the peroxy and native intermediates, In this
   study, these spectroscopic results are complemented by hybrid quantum
   and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations, taking advantage of
   recently available crystal structures with a full complement of copper
   ions. Thereby, we obtain optimized molecular structures for all of the
   Experimentally studied intermediates involved in the reductive cleavage
   of the O-2 molecule and energy profiles for individual reaction steps,
   This allows identification of the experimentally observed intermediates
   and further insight into the reaction mechanism that is probably
   relevant for the whole class of multicopper oxidases, We suggest that
   the peroxy intermediate contains an O-2(2-) ion, in which one oxygen
   atom bridges the type 2 copper ion and one of the type 3 copper ions,
   whereas the other one coordinates to the other type 3 copper ion,
   One-electron reduction of this intermediate triggers the cleavage of the

Abstract = {{We used UV light to generate site-selective O- hole centers at
   three-coordinated corner oxygen sites on MgO nanocubes. These highly
   reactive O- radicals split H-2 homolytically and, in the course of this
   reaction, become hydroxylated and produce hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen
   atoms adsorb predominantly at cube edges and dissociate into
   surface-trapped electrons and protons. We propose that the
   experimentally observed (H+)(e(-)) centers are formed adjacent to the
   hydroxyl groups generated in the homolytic splitting process and can be
   defined as (H+)(3C)center dot(e(-))(H+)(NC) centers where 3C and NC
   refer to the coordination numbers of the corresponding hydroxylated
   oxygen sites. Our ab initio embedded cluster calculations reveal that
   the electronic properties of (H+)(3C)center dot(e(-))(H+)(4C) centers
   situated along MgO nanocube edges are consistent with both the
   electron-paramagnetic-resonance signal parameters and the reported
   optical-absorption properties. The transformation of corner O- centers
   into the (H+)(3C)center dot(e(-))(H+)(NC)-type centers prevents their
   recombination with electronic surface centers and, hence, significantly
   alters the electronic structure of MgO nanocubes by introducing shallow
   electron traps. (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Hereditary congenital facial paresis is a rare autosomal dominantly
   inherited disorder, in which pathological changes in the brainstem
   affect the paired facial nuclei and nerves. Previously, the neuropilin-1
   protein has been shown to control axon guidance and cell body position
   of facial motor neurons, and mice with a targeted disruption of
   neuropilin-1 present with developmental defects of the facial nerve
   nuclei. Plexin-A1 can function as a signal transducing subunit for the
   neuronal neuropilin receptor, and its gene is located in the linkage
   interval for hereditary congenital facial paresis at chromosome 3q21-q22
   (MIM601471), making it an excellent candidate gene for this disorder.
   During mouse embryogenesis, the murine ortholog of plexin-A1 gene showed
   restricted spatial and temporal expression in the hindbrain, consistent
   with a role in cell body movement, or axonal guidance during facial
   nerve development. Sequence analysis of the plexin-A1 gene in patients
   from the 3q21-q22-linked hereditary congenital facial paresis family
   revealed several nucleotide changes. However, none of the nucleotide
   changes led to an amino acid substitution, and reverse transcriptase
   polymerase chain reaction analysis did not detect aberrant RNA
   processing. We therefore conclude that it is highly unlikely that
   Plexin-A1 is involved in the pathogenicity of hereditary congenital
   facial paresis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Previous research has indicated that flavor-flavor leaming is impaired
   in restrained eaters. In Experiment I we sought to extend this finding
   using a larger sample and a more comprehensive assessment of dietary
   behavior. Participants (N=90, including 30 current dieters) sampled
   three novel flavors (CSs), each on 10 separate occasions, in a
   randomized order. Each flavor was paired with chocolate (US) either
   10\%, 50\%, or 90\% of the time. We then assessed liking for the three
   CSs and asked participants to complete the DEBQ-restraint and
   TFEQ-disinhibition sub-scales. After these CS-US parings, restrained
   eaters tended to prefer the 10\% paired flavor whereas unrestrained
   eaters tended to prefer the 90\% paired flavor. Differential CS liking
   was not evident in dieters and it was not predicted by disinhibition.
   Using a similar methodology, in Experiment 2 (N=76) we assessed
   evaluative change following picture-sweet pairings. Relative to the
   other CSs, the restrained eaters reported a greater increase in their
   liking for the 10\% paired CS and the unrestrained eaters reported a
   greater increase in their liking for the 90\% paired CS. We also
   discovered that evaluative change is related to the level of US
   devaluation that takes place during conditioning. Evidence that a sweet
   US can bring about a decrease in liking has not been reported
   previously. One interpretation is that negative beliefs and attitudes
   can contaminate the representation of the US during training. (c) 2005

Pages = {{593-597}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate whether efficiency of weight gain during a
   short pedod of overfeeding is related to adaptive differences in basal
   metabolic rate (BMR) and physical activity.
   Subjects: Fourteen healthy females (age 25 +/- 4 years, BMT 22.1 +/- 2.3
   kg/m(2)).
   Design and measurements: Subjects were overfed with a diet supplying
   50\% more energy than baseline energy requirements for 14 days.
   Overfeeding diets provided 7\% of energy from protein, 40\% from fat and
   53\% from carbohydrates. Body composition was determined using
   hydrodensitometry and isotope dilution, total energy expenditure (TEE)
   with doubly labeled water and basal metabolic rate (BMR) with indirect
   calorimetry. Physical activity (PA) was recorded with a tri-axial
   accelerometer. Results: Body weight increased by 1.45 +/- 0.86 kg (mean
   +/- S.D.) (P < 0.0001), fat mass increased by 1.05 +/- 0.75 kg. Energy
   storage was 57.0 +/- 17.9 MJ, which is the difference between energy
   intake (207.2 MJ) and energy expenditure (150.2 MJ) during overfeeding.
   There was no difference between metabolically efficient and
   metabolically inefficient subjects in changes in BMR and PA.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that the metabolic efficiency of
   weight gain was not related to adaptive changes in energy expenditure.

Abstract = {{In this work, Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain model optical
   coherence tomography (OCT) signals from a horizontally orientated blood
   layer at different stages of red blood cell (RBC) aggregation and
   sedimentation processes. The parameters for aggregating and sedimenting
   blood cells were chosen based on the data available from the literature
   and our earlier experimental studies. We consider two different cases: a
   suspension of washed RBCs in physiological solution (where aggregation
   does not take place) and RBCs in blood plasma (which provides necessary
   conditions for aggregation). Good agreement of the simulation results
   with the available experimental data shows that the chosen optical
   parameters are reasonable. The dependence of the numbers of photons
   contributing to the OCT signal on the number of experienced scattering
   events was analysed for each simulated signal. It was shown that the
   maxima of these dependences correspond to the peaks in the OCT signals
   related to the interfaces between the layers of blood plasma and blood
   cells. Their positions can be calculated from the optical thicknesses of
   the layers, and the absorption and scattering coefficients of the media.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of maternal deprivation (MD) with different conditions were
   examined on the circadian rhythms in plasma corticosterone and locomotor
   activity in adult rats under ad libitum and restricted daily feeding
   (RF), in which rats had free access to food for 2 h for 3 weeks. Three
   different types of MD were performed from postnatal day 1(P1) to day 6
   (P6); MD for 12 h/day (MD12), for 3 h/day in the morning (ND3am) and in
   the afternoon (MD3pm). Under ad libitum feeding, corticosterone levels
   at 08:00 h and 24:00 h were significantly increased in MD12 rats. A
   similar increase was detected in ND3am rats, but not in MD3pm rats.
   Under the RF, corticosterone levels at 08:00 h, 24:00 h, and 04:00 h
   were significantly increased in MD12 rats. Similar elevations were
   detected in NM3am rats, but not in MD3pm rats. Furthermore, prefeeding
   locomotor activities under the RF increased significantly in MD12 rats.
   A similar increase was observed in MD3am rats, but not in MD3pm rats.
   Keeping ambient temperature and humidity at 37 degrees C and 70-80\%
   during MD attenuated the effects of MD on the corticosterone
   rhythmicities under RF as well as ad lib feeding. It is concluded that
   MD in the early postnatal period influences the expressions of circadian
   rhythms in plasma corticosterone and locomotor activity in adult rats.
   Not only the length but also the time of day of MD seems to be critical
   for these effects. Ambient temperature and/or humidity are suggested to
   be one of the factors by which MD exerts its effect. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Journal = {{VETERINARY RECORD}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{157}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{159+}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by H5NI viruses
   were reported almost simultaneously in eight neighbouring Asian
   countries between December 2003 and January 2004, with a ninth reporting
   in August 2004, suggesting that the viruses had spread recently and
   rapidly. However, they had been detected widely in the region in
   domestic waterfowl and terrestrial poultry for several years before
   this, and the absence of widespread disease in the region before 2003,
   apart from localised outbreaks in the Hong Kong Special Autonomous
   Region (SAR), is perplexing. Possible explanations include limited virus
   excretion by domestic waterfowl infected with HSN1, the confusion of
   avian influenza with other serious endemic diseases, the unsanctioned
   use of vaccines, and the under-reporting of disease as a result of
   limited surveillance. There is some evidence that the excretion of the
   viruses by domestic ducks had increased by early 2004, and there is
   circumstantial evidence that they can be transmitted by wild birds. The
   migratory birds from which viruses have been isolated were usually sick
   or dead, suggesting that they would have had limited potential for
   carrying the viruses over long distances unless subclinical infections
   were prevalent. However, there is strong circumstantial evidence that
   wild birds can become infected from domestic poultry and potentially can
   exchange viruses when they share the same environment. Nevertheless,
   there is little reason to believe that wild birds have played a more
   significant role in spreading disease than trade through live bird
   markets and movement of domestic waterfowl. Asian H5NI viruses were
   first detected in domestic geese in southern China in 1996. By 2000,
   their host range had extended to domestic ducks, which played a key role
   in the genesis of the 2003/04 outbreaks. The epidemic was not due to the
   introduction and spread of a single virus but was caused by multiple
   viruses which were genotypically linked to the Goose/GD/96 lineage via
   the haemagglutinin gene. The H5N1 viruses isolated from China, including
   the Hong Kong SAR, between 1999 and 2004 had a range of genotypes and
   considerable variability within genotypes. The rising incidence and
   widespread reporting of disease in 2003/04 can probably be attributed to
   the increasing spread of the viruses from existing reservoirs of
   infection in domestic waterfowl and live bird markets leading to greater
   environmental contamination. When countries in the region started to
   report disease in December 2003, others were alerted to the risk and
   disease surveillance and reporting improved. The H5NI viruses have
   reportedly been eliminated from three of the nine countries that
   reported disease in 2003/04, but they could be extremely difficult to
   eradicate from the remaining countries, owing to the existence of
   populations and, possibly, production and marketing sectors, in which
   apparently normal birds harbour the viruses.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the influence of transverse cracks in a rotating shaft is
   analysed. The paper addresses the two distinct issues of the changes in
   modal properties and the influence of crack breathing on dynamic
   response during operation. Moreover, the evolution of the orbit of a
   cracked rotor near half of the first resonance frequency is
   investigated. The results provide a possible basis for an on-line
   monitoring system.
   In order to conduct this study, the dynamic response of a rotor with a
   breathing crack is evaluated by using the alternate frequency/time
   domain approach. It is shown that this method evaluates the nonlinear
   behaviour of the rotor system rapidly and efficiently by modelling the
   breathing crack with a truncated Fourier series. The dynamic response
   obtained by applying this method is compared with that evaluated through
   numerical integration. The resulting orbit during transient operation is
   presented and some distinguishing features of a cracked rotor are
   examined. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quasi-implicit and two-level explicit finite-difference procedures for
   solving the one-dimensional advection equation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{167}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{46-67}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{A variety of explicit and implicit algorithms has been studied dealing
   with the solution of the one-dimensional advection equation. These
   schemes are based on the weighted finite difference approximations. This
   solution approach proves to be very effective. This procedure is carried
   out in many disciplines including hydrology, oceanography and
   meteorology. The main idea behind the finite-difference methods for
   obtaining the solution of a given partial differential equation is to
   approximate the derivatives appearing in the equation by a set of values
   of the function at a selected number of points. The most usual way to
   generate these approximations is through the use of Taylor series. The
   basis of analysis of the finite-difference equations considered here is
   the modified equivalent partial differential equation approach. It is
   worth noting that from the truncation error of the modified equivalent
   equation, it is possible to eliminate the dominant error terms
   associated with the finite-difference equations that contain weights,
   thus leading to more accurate techniques. Quasi-implicit and two-level
   explicit finite-difference techniques are considered in this article to
   approximately solve the one-dimensional advection problem. Stability of
   the techniques are investigated using the von Neumann stability
   analysis. The results of a numerical experiment are presented, and the
   accuracy and central processor unit (CPU) time needed are discussed and
   compared. Numerical tests show that the new third-order or fourth-order
   methods are more accurate than either of the second-order techniques.

Abstract = {{Endoscopic palliation for the obstructive jaundice Caused by biliary or
   pancreatic malignant tumors is a commonly used medical treatment.
   However, plastic biliary stents are occluded by sludge deposition caused
   by bacterial adhesion in 3-5 months. Chitosan, which has both good
   biocompatibility and antimicrobial capability, was used to modify the
   inner surface of polyethylene (PE) tubing in this study. Chitosan was
   deposited onto the inner surface of oxidized PE tubing with the methanol
   precipitation technique. Attenuated total reflection/Fourier transform
   infrared and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis indicated that
   the chitosan coating was feasible. Contact-angle measurements revealed
   that the surface hydrophilicity of the PE tubing increased with the
   chitosan coating. Morphological analysis with scanning electron
   microscopy showed that the PE Surface became rougher and exhibited
   micropores after the chitosan coating. The adhesion of living
   Escherichia coli to chitosan-coated PE stents, characterized by the
   spreading plate method and scanning electron microscopy analysis, was
   more significant than that to unmodified stents after a 24-h
   phosphate-buffered saline or bile perfusion test. This finding may be
   attributed to the rougher and slightly positively charged surface of
   chitosan-coated PE tubing and to the -CH3 hydrophobic functional groups
   in the chitosan structure. Because of its good biocompatibility,
   chitosan coated on the surface of PE can still be used for biliary stent
   applications with further chemical modification, such as sulfonation and
   quaternization, to increase its antimicrobial ability. (c) 2005 Wiley

Abstract = {{The present study aims to elucidate whether the central melanocortin
   receptors {[}melanocortin-3 and -4 receptors (MC3/4-R)] are involved in
   regulating GnRH pulse generator activity in female goats. The GnRH pulse
   generator activity was electrophysiologically assessed at the intervals
   of characteristic increases in multiple-unit activity (MUA volleys) in
   the mediobasal hypothalamus. In ovariectomized goats, all doses (0.02,
   0.2 and 2 nmol) of MT II, an MC3/4-R agonist, injected into the lateral
   ventricle significantly shortened MUA volley intervals. The duration of
   the period during which MT II accelerated MUA volleys was positively
   correlated with the dose of NIT II injected. The stimulatory effect of
   MT II on the GnRH pulse generator activity was attenuated in the
   presence of estrogen. Intracerebroventricular injection of SHU9119, an
   MC3/4-R antagonist, significantly prolonged MUA volley intervals at 1
   nmol. MT II (0.2 nmol)-induced acceleration of MUA volleys was partially
   blocked by the antagonism of MC3/4-R with pre-administered SHU9119 (1
   nmol). The present findings demonstrate that MC3/4-R are involved in
   maintaining GnRH pulse generator activity in goats. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   solution and twice extracted with n-hexane for removing neutral and
   basic interferences. The aqueous layer was acidified and processed as a

   determined by gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry
   (GC-MS/MS). Influence of experimental conditions on the yield of the
   extraction process and on the efficiency of the further clean-up step
   was thoroughly evaluated. Performance of MS/MS detection in comparison
   to single MS is described. Under final working conditions quantification
   limits between 0.4 and 0.8 ng/g and recoveries from 78\% to 106\% were
   obtained. The method was applied to the analysis of several sludge and
   sediment samples. Only low levels of TCS were detected in some of the
   sediments; however, all three compounds were found in sludge samples at

Abstract = {{The function of p73, a transcription factor belonging to the p53 family,
   is finely regulated by its steady-state protein stability. p73 protein
   degradation/stabilization can be regulated by mechanisms in part
   dependent on the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS): (i) Itch/NEDD4-like
   UPS degradation, (ii) NEDD8 UPS degradation, and (iii) NQO1 20S
   proteasome-dependent (but ubiquitin-independent) breakdown. Here, we
   show that, in vitro, Calpain I can cleave p73 at two distinct sites: the
   first proline-rich region and within the oligomerization domain.
   Consequently, different p73 isoforms can be degraded by calpains, i.e.,
   both N-terminal isoforms (TAp73 and Delta Np73) as well as the
   C-terminal isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). Moreover,
   overexpression of the specific endogenous calpain inhibitor,
   calpastatin, in cultured cells increased the steady-state p73 level.
   This suggests that calpains may play a physiological role in the
   regulation of p73 protein stability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Tissue factor (TF), the cell surface receptor for the serine protease
   FVIIa supports cell migration by interaction with the cytoskeleton.
   Intracellular signaling pathways dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of
   TF modify cell migration and may alter vascular remodeling. Vascular
   remodeling was analyzed in a femoral artery injury and a blood flow
   cessation model in mice with a targeted deletion of the 18
   carboxy-terminal intracellular amino acids of TF (TF Delta ct/Delta ct)
   and compared with TF wild-type mice (TFwt/wt). Morphometric analysis
   revealed a decrease in the intima/media ratio after vascular injury in
   arteries from TF Delta ct/Delta ct compared with TFwt/wt mice ( femoral
   artery injury: 2.4 +/- 0.3 TFwt/wt versus 0.6 +/- 0.3 TF Delta ct/Delta
   ct, n=9 to 10, P=0.002; carotis ligation: 0.45+0.11 TFwt/wt versus 0.22
   +/- 0.03 TF Delta ct/Delta ct, n=12 to 14, P=0.09). This was caused by
   an increase in the media by 54\% (P=0.04) in the femoral artery model
   and by 32\% (P=0.03) after carotis ligation and was associated with an
   increased number of proliferating cells. Isolated aortic smooth muscle
   cells (SMCs) of TFwt/wt mice showed an increased migratory response
   toward the TF ligand active site-inhibited FVIIa that was abolished in
   TF Delta ct/Delta ct SMC. In contrast, the unstimulated proliferation
   rate was increased in TF Delta ct/Delta ct SMC compared with TFwt/wt
   SMCs. Thus, retention of SMCs attributable to a migratory defect and
   increased proliferation results in thickening of the media and in
   decrease in neointima formation after arterial injury. TF cytoplasmic
   domain signaling alters vascular remodeling and, thereby, may play a
   role in the development of restenosis, atherosclerotic disease, and
   neovascularization.}},

   identified as negative regulators of cellular differentiation. EID-1
   seems to inhibit differentiation by blocking histone acetyltransferase

   class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here, we report a novel inhibitor
   of differentiation exhibiting homology with EID-2 termed EID-3
   (EID-2-like inhibitor of differentiation-3). Like EID-2, EID-3 inhibited
   MyoD- and GR alpha-dependent transcription and blocked muscle
   differentiation in cultured cells by binding to class I HDACs. Unlike
   that of EID-2, the C-terminus, but not the N-terminus, of EID-3 was
   required for nuclear localization. EID-3 formed a homodimer or
   heterodimer with EID-2. These results suggest that EID-3 inhibits

Abstract = {{Zircon, monazite and xenotime crystallized over a temperature interval
   of several hundred degrees at the magmatic to hydrothermal transition of
   the Sn and W mineralized Mole Granite. Magmatic zircon and monazite,
   thought to have crystallized from hydrous silicate melt, were dated by
   conventional U-Pb techniques at an age of 247.6 +/- 0.4 and 247.7 +/-
   0.5 Ma, respectively. Xenotime occurring in hydrothermal quartz is found
   to be significantly younger at 246.2 +/- 0.5 Ma and is interpreted to
   represent hydrothermal growth. From associated fluid inclusions it is
   concluded that it precipitated from a hydrothermal brine <= 600 degrees
   C, which is below the accepted closure temperature for U-Pb in this
   mineral. These data are compatible with a two-stage crystallization
   process: precipitation of zircon and monazite as magmatic liquidus
   phases in deep crustal magma followed by complete crystallization and
   intimately associated Sn-W mineralization after intrusion of the
   shallow, sill-like body of the Mole Granite. Later hydrothermal
   formation of monazite in a biotite-fluorite-topaz reaction rim around a
   mineralized vein was dated at 244.4 +/- 1.4 Ma, which distinctly
   postdates the Mole Granite and is possibly related to a younger hidden
   intrusion and its hydrothermal fluid system.
   Obtaining precise age data for magmatic and hydrothermal minerals of the
   Mole Granite is hampered by uncertainties introduced by different
   corrections required for multiple highly radiogenic minerals
   crystallising from evolved hydrous granites, including Th-230
   disequilibrium due to Th/U fractionation during monazite and possibly
   xenotime crystallization, variable Th/U ratios of the fluids from which
   xenotime was precipitating, elevated contents of common lead, and
   post-crystallization lead loss in zircon, enhanced by the
   fluid-saturated environment. The data imply that monazite can also
   survive as a liquidus phase in protracted magmatic systems over periods
   of 10 6 years. The outlined model is in agreement with prominent
   chemical core-rim variation of the zircon. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we reexamine the well-known Bragg fibers from a very
   simple, analytical point of view. It is found that with a very small
   number of cladding regions one can obtain modal characteristics of Bragg
   fibers which are similar to those of the step-index standard fiber under
   the weak-guidance condition. The Bragg fibers are therefore close
   competitors of the standard weakly-guiding step-index fiber with respect
   to the few mode-guidance properties, apart from low absorption. We show
   this for some special cases by obtaining the dispersion curves. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The structural organization of Bombyx mori silk fibroin was investigated
   by infrared (IR)spectroscopy. To this aim, (AG)(15) and other model
   peptides of varying chain length, containing tyrosine (Y), valine (V),
   and serine (S) in the basic (AG)(n) sequence were synthesized by the
   solid phase method and their spectroscopic properties were determined.
   Both the position and the relative content of Y, V, and S residues in
   the (AG)(n) model system appeared critical in determining the preferred
   conformation, i.e., silk I, silk II, and unordered structures. Curve
   fitting analysis in the amide I range showed that the model peptides
   with prevailing silk H structure displayed different beta-sheet content,
   which was dependent on the degree of interruption of the (AG), sequence.
   In this regard, the bands at about 1000 and 980 cm(-1), specifically
   assigned to the AG sequence of the B. mori silk fibroin chain, were
   identified as marker of the degree of interruption of the (AG)(n)
   sequence.
   A stable silk I structure was observed only when the Y residue was
   located near the chain terminus, while a silk I -> silk II
   conformational transition occurred when it was positioned in the central
   region of the peptide.
   Analysis of the second-derivative spectra in the amide I range allowed
   us to identify a band at 1639 cm(-1) (4 -> 1 hydrogen-bonded type II
   beta-turns), which is characteristic of the silk I conformation. (c)

Abstract = {{Pyridoxal-5-phosphate, the biological active form of pyridoxine, is a
   cofactor for dopa-decarboxylase (DDC) enzyme. Pyridoxine may augment the
   conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery and therefore
   decrease availability of levodopa to the brain. However, this effect can
   be negated in the presence of a DDC inhibitor, which potentiates plasma
   levodopa level. A single nucleotide polymorphism at the nucleotide 1947
   in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene encodes the high (COMTH)
   and low activity (COMTL) forms of the enzyme. In this study, we examined
   the effect of the COMTL allele on the clinical response to pyridoxine in
   Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. PD patients who were on stable and
   optimized dose of levodopa were included in this study. Their mean motor
   and activities of living score improved after high dose pyridoxine (P =
   0.09, P = 0.04), and worsened after a washout period (P = 0.005, P =
   0.001). Using a multivariate model, the presence of the COMTL allele
   predicted response to pyridoxine, with the best outcome observed in
   COMTL/L homozygotes. Our observational study suggests that the status
   the functional COMTL variant may be potentially useful to select PD
   patients for high dose pyridoxine therapy. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid reversed-phase separation in the time-scale of seconds was
   conducted using methacrylate-based C18 monolithic capillary columns at
   high flow rates and elevated temperatures. The reversed-phase monolithic
   columns were prepared by in situ polymerization of octadecyl
   methacrylate (ODMA) and ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) within the
   confines of a polyimide-coated fused silica capillary. When a mixture of
   isoamyl alcohol and 1,4-butandiol was employed as a porogenic solvent,
   highly permeable monolithic stationary phases with adequate separation
   efficiency were reproducibly produced. The pressure drops of 20 cm-long
   columns were typically below 0.4 MPa at a normal flow rate of 3 mu L/min
   (linear velocity of I mm/s), and the theoretical plate numbers mostly
   reached 3000 plates/20 cm. These monolithic columns exhibited excellent
   mechanical strength as well as thermal stability, and they were properly
   operated even at a temperature of 80 degrees C and a high linear
   velocity of 100 mm/s. At 80 degrees C, the theoretical plate numbers
   exceeded 6000 plates/20 cm due to the enhanced mass transfer.
   Consequently, a series of alkylbenzenes, from toluene to amylbenzene,
   could be efficiently separated within 30 s on the 20 cm-long column by
   carrying out a ultra-high flow rate gradient at 80 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{In this study a protocol for the analysis of thiamin and thiamin
   coenzymes in whole blood was developed. Thiamin and its coenzymes are
   analyzed by reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), precolumn
   derivatisation with alkaline potassium ferricyanide and fluorescence
   detection, all at pH 10. Under these relatively high pH conditions the
   delectability of the analytes and the robustness of the method were
   substantially improved. The use of a high pH resistant RPLC column was a
   crucial step in developing this analysis method. Reproducibility,
   linearity, recovery, detection limit and column robustness were
   investigated. The within-batch CV was < 2.5\%, the between-batch CV <
   4.5\%. The method was linear far above the physiological relevant
   concentration level. Recovery was almost 100\% on an average. The limit
   of quantification was 1 nmol/l. The robustness of the RPLC column proved
   to be very high. Up to 1500 injections hardly any substantial changes in
   retention times and efficiency were observed. In summary: Using a high
   pH resistant RPLC column resulted in a robust, sensitive and precise
   method for the analysis of total Vitamin B I and especially of TDP. (c)

   neuronal cell differentiation and proliferation. It is unknown, however,
   whether it possesses a neuroprotective property. Here, we report that
   SPD prevented neuronal cell death from H2O2 exposure and increased the
   levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), a serine/threonine protein kinase.
   The SPD-induced neuroprotection and activation of Akt were blocked by
   LY294002, a PI3-K inhibitor, suggesting that the anti-apoptotic action
   of SPD is mediated via the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway. Thus, as a
   survival or anti-apoptotic factor for neuronal cells, SPD may contribute
   to the therapeutic action of SPD in SZ treatment. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nine kinds of hetero-chitooligosaccharides (hetero-COSs) with different

   ultrafiltration (UF) membrane reactor system. In addition, their

   trimethylamine-sulfur trioxide to investigate the functional group of
   COSs on beta-secretase inhibitory activity. 90-MMWCOSs-I, which are 90\%
   deacetylated COSs passed through the 5 kDa membrane but not passed
   through the 3 kDa membrane, exhibited the highest P-secretase inhibitory
   activity (25-42 mu M) based on molecular weight of 3 and 5 kDa. The
   inhibition pattern of the inhibitor was found to be a noncompetitive by
   Dixon plot, and K-i of 90-MMWCOSs-I was 3.8,7-6.47 mu M. Therefore, the

Abstract = {{Cellular senescence has been theorized to oppose neoplastic
   transformation triggered by activation of oncogenic pathways in
   vitro(1-3), but the relevance of senescence in vivo has not been
   established. The PTEN and p53 tumour suppressors are among the most
   commonly inactivated or mutated genes in human cancer including prostate
   cancer(4,5). Although they are functionally distinct, reciprocal
   cooperation has been proposed, as PTEN is thought to regulate p53
   stability, and p53 to enhance PTEN transcription(6-10). Here we show
   that conditional inactivation of Trp53 in the mouse prostate fails to
   produce a tumour phenotype, whereas complete Pten inactivation in the
   prostate triggers non-lethal invasive prostate cancer after long
   latency. Strikingly, combined inactivation of Pten and Trp53 elicits
   invasive prostate cancer as early as 2 weeks after puberty and is
   invariably lethal by 7 months of age. Importantly, acute Pten
   inactivation induces growth arrest through the p53-dependent cellular
   senescence pathway both in vitro and in vivo, which can be fully rescued
   by combined loss of Trp53. Furthermore, we detected evidence of cellular
   senescence in specimens from early-stage human prostate cancer. Our
   results demonstrate the relevance of cellular senescence in restricting
   tumorigenesis in vivo and support a model for cooperative tumour
   suppression in which p53 is an essential failsafe protein of
   Pten-deficient tumours.}},

Abstract = {{The pH-dependent adsorption isotherms for the charged chromophore
   crystal violet, CV+, have been measured with three different bases by a
   free-running cavity implementation of evanescent wave cavity ring-down
   spectroscopy. The ratio of the maximal absorbance measurements at pH
   5.10 and 9.05 is consistent with a Q2:Q3 silanol site ratio of
   72.8:27.2. The adsorption isotherms have been interpreted in terms a
   cooperative binding adsorption allowing more than one ionic species to
   bind to each silanol group. The surface concentration is consistent with
   a silanol charge density of 1.92 +/- 0.55 nm(-2) and a total neutralized
   interface layer structure extending 9 nm from the surface. Binding
   constants and stoichiometric coefficients are derived for CV+ to both
   the Q2 and Q3 sites. A variation of the adsorption isotherm with base is
   observed so that the isotherm at pH 9.05 adjusted with ammonium
   hydroxide sets up a competitive acid-base equilibrium with the SiOH
   groups with only 49\% of the surface silanol sites dissociated. The
   implications for functionalized surfaces in chromatography are

Abstract = {{Context Although impunity for those responsible for trauma is widely
   thought to be associated with psychological problems in survivors of
   political violence, no study has yet investigated this issue.
   Objective To examine the mental health and cognitive effects of war
   trauma and how appraisal of redress for trauma and beliefs about
   justice, safety, other people, war cause, and religion relate to
   posttraumatic stress responses in war survivors.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional survey conducted
   between March 2000 and July 2002 with a population-based sample of 1358
   war survivors who had experienced at least 1 war-related stressor
   (combat, torture, internal displacement, refugee experience, siege,
   and/or aerial bombardment) from 4 sites in former Yugoslavia, accessed
   through linkage sampling. Control groups at 2 study sites were matched
   with survivors on sex, age, and education.
   Main Outcome Measures Semi-structured Interview for Survivors of War,
   Redress for Trauma Survivors Questionnaire, Emotions and Beliefs After
   War questionnaire, Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).
   Results The mean (SD) age was 39 (12) years, 806 (59\%) were men, and
   339 (25\%) had high school or higher level of education. Participants
   reported experiencing a mean of 12.6 war-related events, with 292 (22\%)
   and 451 (33\%) having current and lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD), respectively, and 129 (10\%) with current major depression. A
   total of 1074 (79\%) of the survivors reported a sense of injustice in
   relation to perceived lack of redress for trauma. Perceived impunity for
   those held responsible for trauma was only one of the factors associated
   with sense of injustice. Relative to controls, survivors had stronger
   emotional responses to impunity, greater fear and loss of control over
   life, less belief in benevolence of people, greater loss of meaning in
   war cause, stronger faith in God, and higher rates of PTSD and
   depression. Fear and loss of control over life were associated with PTSD
   and depression (odds ratio {[}OR], 2.91; 95\% Cl, 2.27-3.74 and OR,
   2.30; 95\% Cl, 1.75-3.03, respectively), and emotional responses to
   impunity showed a relatively weaker association with PTSD (OR, 1.53;
   95\% Cl, 1.16-2.02) and depression (OR, 1.39; 95\% Cl, 1.02-1.91).
   Appraisal of redress for trauma was not associated with PTSD or
   depression.
   Conclusions PTSD and depression in war survivors appear to be
   independent of sense of injustice arising from perceived lack of redress
   for trauma. Fear of threat to safety and loss of control over life
   appeared to be the most important mediating factors in PTSD and
   depression. These findings may have important implications for
   reconciliation efforts in postwar countries and effective interventions
   for traumatized war survivors.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Increased DNA methylation is an epigenetic alteration that
   is common in human cancers and is often associated with transcriptional
   silencing. Aberrantly methylated DNA has also been proposed as a
   potential tumor marker. However, genes such as vimentin, which are
   transcriptionally silent in normal epithelium, have not until now been
   considered as targets for cancer-associated aberrant methylation and for
   use as cancer markers. Methods: We applied methylation-specific
   polymerase chain reaction to the vimentin gene, which is
   transcriptionally silent in normal colonocytes, and compared methylation
   of vimentin exon-1 in cancer tissues and in fecal DNA from colon cancer
   patients versus control samples from healthy subjects. Results: Vimentin
   exon-1 sequences were unmethylated in 45 of 46 normal colon tissues. In
   contrast, vimentin exon-1 sequences were methylated in 83\% (38 of 46)
   and 53\% (57 of 107) of tumors from two independently collected groups
   of colon cancer patients. When evaluated as a marker for colon cancer
   detection in fecal DNA from another set of colon cancer patients,
   aberrant vimentin methylation was detected in fecal DNA from 43 of 94
   patients, for a sensitivity of 46\% (95\% confidence interval {[}Cl] =
   35\% to 56\%). The sensitivity for detecting stage I and II cancers was
   43\% (26 of 60 case patients) (95\% Cl = 31\% to 57\%). Only 10\% (20 of
   198 case patients) of control fecal DNA samples from cancer-free
   individuals tested positive for vimentin methylation, for a specificity
   of 90\% (95\% Cl = 85\% to 94\%). Conclusions: Aberrant methylation of
   exon-1 sequences within the nontranscribed vimentin gene is a novel
   molecular biomarker of colon cancer and can be successfully detected in
   fecal DNA to identify nearly half of individuals with colon cancer.}},

Abstract = {{In part 1 of this two part paper, the impact of pH and temperature on
   structure and rheological properties at the various process steps of the
   model CPT manufacture were reported. Part 2 uses temperature and pH
   values established in part I and concentrates on the impact of agitation
   conditions on the CPT product and their implications for scale-up. It is
   seen that the main drivers for the process are pH and temperature, but
   if a product is to be obtained that can meet the typical tight
   commercial size distribution and morphology specification, then mixing
   aspects must be understood. The initial stages involving lowering the pH
   to cause destabilization, flocculation, and gelling required intense
   micromixing to prevent oversize CPT product. For gel breakage, again
   intense agitation was necessary to ensure full motion in the gel due to
   its yield stress. Intense agitation here was also able to reduce the
   amount of oversize CPT product to meet specification. All these
   processing aspects are analyzed in detail in this paper in the light of
   the present knowledge of mixing. The findings also throw some
   interesting light on the impact of mixing on aggregate structure at
   scales below the Kolmogoroff microscale of turbulence, appearing to give
   support to the ideas of Levich.}},

Abstract = {{Natural edges created by fire are a common component of forest
   ecosystems with moderate-severity fire regimes and will continue to be
   important as the frequency of extreme fire events increases due to
   historical fire suppression throughout North America. The effect of
   high-severity fires, with and without salvage logging, on adjacent
   intact forest patches has not been studied. Fourteen years after a
   wildfire, we examined the structure and composition of vegetation along
   the gradient from burned stands into the adjacent forest interior at
   three salvage logged edges and three unsalvaged edges in
   Douglas-fir/hardwood forests of northwestern California. Natural,
   unsalvaged edges were characterized by an increase of native, ruderal
   species, rather than a reduction of forest interior species. Only two
   forest interior species reacted negatively to the edge environment, both
   at salvaged edges. Old-growth community types, identified by two-way
   indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), occurred 30 m closer to the edge
   at unsalvaged sites, compared to salvaged sites. Twenty commonly
   observed species (> 10\% frequency) demonstrated significant responses
   to the edge environment; I I species had a larger depth of edge
   influence (DEI) at salvaged edges, three had a larger DEI at unsalvaged
   edges, and six had an equal DEL Our results suggest that, compared to
   unsalvaged stands, the removal of snags and subsequent broadcast burning
   of salvaged logged stands significantly altered plant composition and
   structure of the edge environment. By increasing the patch contrast
   between burned and intact forest stands, salvage logging increased the
   depth of edge influence of fire-created edges by 15-30 m. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{We present in detail the propagation of an IP shock observed by multiple
   spacecraft in the solar wind and by INTERBALL (IB) in the magnetosheath
   ( hereafter MSH). Our investigation brings an evidence that the observed
   IP shock slightly decelerates in the MSH contrary to gasdynamic
   prediction. This result motivates a statistical study of a small number
   of similar shocks observed in the solar wind and in the MSH that
   confirmed the case study result. Moreover, we model the interaction of
   IP shocks with the magnetosphere using an MHD model and show that the
   observation of shock deceleration agrees with the model prediction. The
   MHD model suggests that the speed of the shock front propagation in the
   MSH decreases from the bow shock toward the magnetopause and the front
   of the IP shock deforms. However, the experimental data are not
   sufficient to undoubtedly confirm this trend.}},

Abstract = {{The water-soluble zwitterionic polythiophene,
   poly(3-((S)-5-amino-5-carboxyl-3-oxapentyl)-2,5-thiophene) hydrochloride
   (POWT), is a conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE) with properties well
   suited for biochip applications. CPEs readily form hydrogels when
   exposed to water-based buffer solutions or biomolecule solutions. In
   this work, we used in situ quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
   (QCM-D) monitoring to collect information on the interaction between
   POWT films exposed to buffers with different pH and POWT/DNA chains. Our
   data show that POWT swells significantly when exposed to low-pH buffers,
   such as pH 4 acetate, this is seen as an increase in thickness and
   decrease in viscosity obtained via a Voight-based modeling of combined f
   and D QCM-D measurements. The magnitude of thickness and viscosity
   change upon changing from a pH 10 carbonate buffer to pH 4 acetate is
   100\% increase in thickness and 50\% decrease in viscosity. The response
   of the hydrogel under pH change is well correlated with fluorescence
   data from POWT films on glass. The state of the hydrogel is important
   during interaction with biomolecules; illustrated by the observation
   that a swollen CPE hydrogel adsorbs a higher amount of DNA than a
   compacted one. In agreement with previous results, the QCM-D data
   confirmed that the POWT/DNA hydrogel sense complementary DNA
   specifically and with negligible binding of noncomplementary DNA. These
   results are important for efficient constructions of biochips in water
   environments using this class of materials.}},

Abstract = {{Two metal iodates, Nd(IO3)(3) and AI(IO3)(3), have been prepared by
   hydrothermal reactions at 170 degrees C. The X-ray single-crystal
   structural analysis showed that Nd(IO3)(3) presented here is a new
   polymorph crystallizing in a monoclinic space group P2(1)/n In with a =
   8.859(1) angstrom, b = 5.9296(5)angstrom, c = 15.301(3)angstrom,
   beta=96.95(1)degrees, Z=4. Al(IO3)(3) crystallizes in a
   non-centrosymmetric group P6(3) with a=9.003(1)angstrom, c = 5.2406(5)
   angstrom, Z=2. The crystal structure of Nd(IO3)(3) consists of 1D chains
   of edge-sharing NdO9 polyhedra, which are stitched into slabs through
   the bridging 103 groups; and slabs are held together via the weak I-O
   bonds resulting in a 3D framework. AI(103)3 is characterized by the
   slightly distorted AlO6 octahedra that are bridged by 103 groups giving
   rise to a 3D polar network. Infrared spectra further confirmed that both
   compounds contain low symmetric IO3- groups. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   fluctuations are usually believed to act as a source of disturbance on

Abstract = {{The multifunctional Nef protein of HIV-1 is important for the
   progression to AIDS. One action of Nef is to down-regulate surface MHC I
   molecules, helping infected cells to evade immunity. We found that Nef
   also down-regulates the macrophage-expressed MHC 1b protein HFE, which
   regulates iron homeostasis and is mutated in the iron-overloading
   disorder hemochromatosis. In model cell lines, Nef reroutes HFE to a
   perinuclear structure that overlaps the trans-Golgi network, causing a
   90\% reduction of surface HFE. This activity requires a
   Src-kinase-binding proline-rich domain of Nef and a conserved
   tyrosine-based motif in the cyto-plasmic tail of HFE. HIV-1 infection of
   ex vivo macrophages similarly down-regulates naturally expressed surface
   HFE in a Nef-dependent manner. The effect of Nef expression on cellular
   iron was explored; iron and ferritin accumulation were increased in
   HIV-1-infected ex vivo macrophages expressing wild-type HFE, but this
   effect was lost with Nef-deleted HIV-1 or when infecting macrophages
   from hemochromatosis patients expressing mutated HFE. The iron
   accumulation in HIV-1-infected HFE-expressing macrophages was paralleled
   by an increase in cellular HIV-1-gag expression. We conclude that,
   through Nef and HFE, HIV-1 directly regulates cellular iron metabolism,
   possibly benefiting viral growth.}},

Abstract = {{Human myoglobin (Mb) possesses a unique cysteine (Cys110), whereas other
   mammalian Mbs do not. To investigate the effect of a cysteine residue on
   Mb, we introduced cysteine to various sites on the surface of sperm
   whale Mb (K56C, V66C, K96C, K102C, A125C, and A144C) by mutation. The
   cysteines. were inserted near the end of a-helices, except for V66C,
   where the cysteine was introduced in the middle of an cc-helix.
   Reduction of the heme was observed for each mutant metMb by incubation
   at 37 degrees C under carbon monoxide atmosphere, which was much faster
   than reduction of wild-type metMb under the same condition. Heme
   reduction did not occur significantly under nitrogen or oxygen
   atmospheres. The rate constant for heme reduction increased for higher
   mutant Mb concentration, whereas it did not change significantly when
   the CO concentration was reduced from 100\% CO to 50\% CO with 50\% O-2.
   The similarity in the rate constants with different CO concentrations
   indicates that CO stabilizes the reduced heme by coordination to the
   heme iron. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that mutant Mb dimers were formed by
   incubation under CO atmosphere but not under air. These dimers were
   converted back to Mb monomers by an addition of 2-mercaptoethanol, which
   showed formation of a Mb dimer through a disulfide bond. The rate
   constant decreased in general as the heme-cysteine distance was
   increased, although V66C Mb exhibited a very small rate constant. Since
   V66 is placed in the middle of an alpha-helix, steric hindrance would
   occur and prevent formation of a dimer when the cysteine residues of two
   different V66C Mb molecules interact with each other. The rate constants
   also decreased for K56C and A144C Mbs presumably because of the
   electrostatic repulsion during dimer formation, since they are
   relatively charged around the inserted cysteine.}},

Abstract = {{Electron transfer (ET) within proteins occurs by means of chains of
   redox intermediates that favor directional and efficient electron
   delivery to an acceptor. Individual ET steps are energetically
   characterized by the electronic coupling V, driving force Delta G, and
   reorganization energy A. A reflects the nuclear rearrangement of the
   redox partners and their environment associated with the reactions;
   lambda approximate to 700-1,100 meV (11 eV = 1.602 x 10(-19) J) has been
   considered as a typical value for intraprotein ET. In nonphotosynthetic
   systems, functional ET is difficult to assess directly. However, using
   femtosecond flash photolysis of the CO-poised membrane protein
   cytochrome c oxidase, the intrinsic rate constant of the low-Delta G
   electron injection from heme a into the heme a(3)-CUB active site was
   recently established at (1.4 ns)(-1). Here, we determine the temperature
   dependence of both the rate constant and Delta G of this reaction and
   establish that this reaction is activationless. Using a quantum
   mechanical form of nonadiabatic ET theory and common assumptions for the
   coupled vibrational modes, we deduce that A is < 200 meV. It is
   demonstrated that the previously accepted value of 760 meV actually
   originates from the temperature dependence of Cu-B-CO bond breaking. We
   discuss that low-AG, low-A reactions are common for efficiently
   channeling electrons through chains that are buried inside membrane
   proteins.}},

Abstract = {{The Joule heating induced transient temperature field and its effect on
   the electroosmotic flow in a capillary packed with microspheres is
   analyzed numerically using the control-volume-based finite difference
   method. The model incorporates the coupled momentum equation for the
   electroosmotic velocity, the energy equations for the Joule heating
   induced temperature distributions in both the packed column and the
   capillary wall, and the mass and electric current continuity equations.
   The temperature-dependent physical properties of the electrolyte
   solution are taken into consideration. The characteristics of the Joule
   heating induced transient development of temperature and electroosmotic
   flow fields are studied. Specifically, the simulation shows that the
   presence of Joule heating causes a noticeable axial temperature gradient
   in the thermal entrance region and elevates a significant temperature
   increment inside the microcapillary. The temperature changes in turn
   greatly affect the electroosmotic velocity by means of the
   temperature-dependent fluid viscosity, dielectric constant, and local
   electric field strength. Furthermore, the model predicts an induced
   pressure gradient to counterbalance the axial variation of the
   electroosmotic velocity so as to maintain the fluid mass continuity. In
   addition, under specific conditions, the present model is validated by
   comparing with the existing analytical model and experimental data from

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates that CTD data from autonomous profiling floats
   can be used to detect basin-scale changes of water properties on

   that floats have the following value: real-time float data are of
   sufficient accuracy to reveal changes in ocean properties on timescales
   of a decade or less; floats achieve spatial and temporal coverage not
   possible with research ships, providing vital supporting evidence for
   the interpretation of cruise CTD data. Floats therefore provide a

Abstract = {{Steady state groundwater flow driven by constant recharge in an
   unconfined aquifer overlying sloping bedrock is shown to be represented,
   using the Dupuit approximation, by an ordinary differential equation of
   the Abel type y(x)center dot y'(x)+a center dot y(x)+x=0, whose
   analytical solution is derived in this work. This article first
   investigates the case of zero saturated thickness at the upstream
   boundary, a flow system reminiscent of perched groundwater created by
   percolation of precipitation or irrigation in a sloping aquifer fully
   draining at its downstream boundary. A variant of this flow system
   occurs when the phreatic surface mounds and produces groundwater
   discharge toward the upstream boundary. This variant is a generalization
   of the classical groundwater flow problem involving two lakes connected
   by an aquifer, the latter being on sloping terrain in this instance.
   Analytical solutions for the phreatic surface's steady state geometry
   are derived for the case of monotonically declining hydraulic head as
   well as for the case of a mounded phreatic surface. These solutions are
   of practical interest in drainage studies, slope stability, and runoff
   formation investigations. It is shown that the flow factor a=-root K/N
   tan beta (where K, N, and tan beta are the hydraulic conductivity,
   vertical recharge, and aquifer slope, respectively) has a commanding
   role on the phreatic surface's solutions. Two computational examples
   illustrate the implementation of this article's results.}},

Abstract = {{Contraction and relaxation of heart muscle cells is regulated by cycling
   of calcium between cytoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Human
   phospholamban (PLN), expressed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane as
   a 30-kDa homopentamer, controls cellular calcium levels by a mechanism
   that depends on its phosphorylation. Since PLN was discovered
   approximate to 30 years ago, extensive studies have aimed to explain how
   it influences calcium pumps and to determine whether it acts as an ion
   channel. We have determined by solution NMR methods the atomic
   resolution structure of an unphosphorylated PLN pentamer in
   dodecylphosphocholine micelles. The unusual bellflower-like assembly is
   held together by leucine/isoleucine zipper motifs along the
   membrane-spanning helices. The structure reveals a channel-forming
   architecture that could allow passage of small ions. The central pore
   gradually widens toward the cytoplasmic end as the transmembrane helices
   twist around each other and bend outward. The dynamic N-terminal
   amphipathic helices point away from the membrane, perhaps facilitating
   recognition and inhibition of the calcium pump.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy
   of multislice computed tomography (MSCT) coronary angiography using a
   new 64-stice scanner.
   BACKGROUND The new 64-slice MSCT scanner has improved spatial resolution
   of 0.4 mm and a faster rotation time (330 ins) compared to prior MSCT
   scanners.
   METHODS We studied 70 consecutive patients undergoing elective invasive
   coronary angiography. Patients were excluded for atrial fibrillation,
   but not for high heart rate, coronary calcification, or obesity. All
   vessels were analyzed, including those < 1.5 mm in diameter; MSCT
   lesions were analyzed quantitatively as well as by a qualitative scale
   and compared to quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Results were
   also analyzed for significant coronary stenoses (over 50\% luminal
   narrowing) by segment, by artery, and by patient.
   RESULTS All scans showed diagnostic image quality. Of 1,065 segments,
   935 (88\%) could be evaluated, and 773 of 935 (83\%) could be assessed
   quantitatively by both MSCT and QCA. The Spearman correlation
   coefficient between MSCT and QCA was 0.76 (p < 0.0001). Bland-Altman
   analysis demonstrated a mean difference in percent stenosis of 1.3 +/-
   14.2\%. A total of 26\% of patients had calcium scores above 400
   Agatston U, 25\% had heart rates > 70 beats/min, and 50\% were obese.
   Specificity, sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive values
   for the presence of significant stenoses were: by segment (n = 935),
   86\%, 95\%, 66\%, and 98\%, respectively-, by artery (n = 279), 91\%,
   92\%, 80\%, and 97\%, respectively, by patient (n = 70), 95\%, 90\%,
   93\%, and 93\%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate high quantitative and qualitative
   diagnostic accuracy of 64-slice MSCT in comparison to QCA in a broad
   spectrum of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Factor XI, unlike other coagulation proteins, is a homodimer of two
   identical subunits linked by a single disulfide bond formed by Cys321.
   The present study was undertaken to understand the physiological
   significance of the dimeric nature of factor XI. We have expressed a
   mutant FXI/G326C in which the Gly326 residue of factor XI has been
   mutated to Cys326, reasoning that Cys321 would form an intrachain
   disulfide bond with Cys326 as in prekallikrein, a plasma protein that
   exists as a monomer even with 58\% amino acid sequence identity and a
   domain structure very similar to factor XI. No free thiol could be
   detected in the expressed protein, and it migrated as a monomer on
   nonreduced SDS-PAGE. In physiological buffer, however, the protein was
   found to exist in a state of monomer-dimer equilibrium as assessed by
   gel-filtration chromatography and ultracentrifugation studies (K-d
   similar to 36 nM). Functional studies revealed that FXI/G326C was
   indistinguishable from plasma factor XI in a plasma-clotting assay and
   in a factor IX activation assay both in the presence and absence of
   activated platelets even at concentrations at which less than 5\% of the
   mutant exists as dimers. We conclude that, for optimal function in the
   presence of activated platelets, a preformed dimer of factor XI is not
   required.}},

Abstract = {{The catalytic oxidation of 1-butene was studied in the temperature range
   of 390-553 K in presence and absence Of 02 and water vapor. An increase
   in acetic acid yield was observed with increasing temperature up to a
   maximum at 520 K. The addition of water promoted the formation of acetic
   acid and suppressed total oxidation reactions. Transient isotopic
   experiments with O-18(2)/O-16(2) and (H2O)-O-18/(H2O)-O-16 were carried
   out to investigate the role of gas oxygen and water in the formation of
   acetic acid. In absence of water the isotopic exchange was slow and
   complete at high temperatures. On the contrary, a fast but incomplete
   isotopic exchange in acetic acid was observed in presence of water.
   Isotopic transient experiments with O-18(2) and (H2O)-O-18 revealed that
   O-18 from (H2O)-O-18 was more readily incorporated into acetic acid than
   O-18 from O-18(2) pointing to a role of water as a reactant. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Background - Interleukin (IL)- 18 plays a key role in atherosclerosis
   and its complications. The present study investigated the genetic
   variability of 4 genes of the IL-18 system - IL18, IL18R1,IL18RAP, and
   IL18BP - in relation to circulating IL-18 levels and cardiovascular
   mortality.
   Methods and Results - Twenty-two polymorphisms were genotyped in 1288
   patients with coronary artery disease prospectively followed up during a
   median period of 5.9 years. The end point was death from cardiovascular
   causes ( n = 142). Baseline IL-18 levels were predictive of
   cardiovascular deaths occurring during <= 4 years of follow-up ( HR =
   2.96, 95\% CI 1.54 to 5.70, P = 0.001 for the top compared with the
   bottom quartile) but not of later deaths. Haplotypes of the IL18 gene
   were associated with IL-18 levels ( P = 0.002) and cardiovascular
   mortality ( P = 0.006) after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors.
   The same haplotype was associated with both a 9\% lowering effect on
   IL-18 levels and a protective effect on risk ( HR = 0.57, 95\% CI 0.36
   to 0.92). IL18 haplotypes explained only 2\% of IL-18 variability.
   Adjustment for baseline IL-18 levels abolished the association of
   haplotypes with cardiovascular risk. The haplotype associated with
   phenotypes was the only one carrying the minor allele of the IL18/A +
   183G polymorphism located in the 3 `untranslated region and potentially
   affecting mRNA stability. The other genes of the system were not related
   to IL-18 levels or cardiovascular outcome.
   Conclusion - Variations of the IL18 gene consistently influence
   circulating levels of IL-18 and clinical outcome in patients with
   coronary artery disease, which supports the hypothesis of a causal role
   of IL-18 in atherosclerosis and its complications.}},

Abstract = {{The polycrystalline HfFe6Ge6-type REMn6Sn4Ge2 compounds (rare earth, RE=
   Sc, Y, Nd, Sm, Gd-Tm, Lu) have been characterised by X-ray diffraction
   and studied by magnetisation measurements. They order above room
   temperature into a ferromagnetic (Nd, Sm), ferrimagnetic (Gd-Ho) or
   antiferromagnetic (Sc, Y, Er, Tm, Lu) state. The magnetic properties
   significantly deviate from those of ternary stannides suggesting a
   weaker antiferromagnetic character of the Mn sublattice. According to
   the measured coercive fields, it is suggested that the
   magneto-crystalline anisotropy is close to that of ternary germanides.
   The peculiar behaviour of this series might be! related to the
   preferential occupation of the 2(c) site by the substituted Ge atoms.

Abstract = {{Risk assessment of maize yield was carried out using a crop growth model
   combined with a deterministic runoff model and a stochastic rainfall
   intensity model. These were compared with empirical models of daily
   rainfall-runoff processes. The combination of the deterministic runoff
   model and the stochastic rainfall intensity model gave more flexible
   performance than the empirical runoff model. Scenarios of crop
   simulation included production techniques (water harvesting, WH, and
   conventional total soil tillage, CT) and initial soil water content at
   planting (empty, half and full). The in-field water harvesting technique
   used in the simulation was a no-till type of mini-catchment with basin
   tillage and mulching. The lower the initial soil water content at
   planting, the greater the yield difference between the WH and CT
   production techniques. With the low initial soil water content at
   planting, the WH production technique had up to 50\% higher yield
   compared to the CT production technique, clearly thus demonstrating the
   superiority of the WH production technique. Under all the variations in
   agronomic practices (planting date, plant population, cultivar type)
   tested, the WH had a lower risk than CT under these semi-arid climatic
   conditions (i.e., WH increased the probability of higher crop yields).

   Both XRD and SEM indicated the particle sizes of them were in the range
   of around 1 mu m. The excitation spectra presented a broad spectral band
   in the visible blue-violet region with the maximum excitation peak at

Abstract = {{Anionic surfactant (sodium oleate, SO) was used to pretreat
   polypropylene fibrous filters to make them negatively charged. This work
   examines the effects on particle loading of an anionic
   surfactant-pretreated filter. Also, the effects of various factors, such
   as the particle size, the face velocity, concentration of the
   surfactant, and particle distribution (mono and poly) on the particle
   loading characteristics were evaluated.
   Experimental data reveal that the electric field of a filter treated
   with anionic surfactant (SO) could be directly measured using an
   electrofieldmeter, suggesting that the pretreatment with surfactant
   charged the filters. The results demonstrate that pretreating the filter
   with SO surfactant increases its particle-loading capacity. The clogging
   points of the untreated filter, and of the 0.01, 0.05 and 0.08 M
   SO-pretreated filter are 18, 23, 28 and 33 g/m(2). The loading behavior
   of the SO-pretreated filter depended on the size of the particles and
   the operating face velocity. Additionally, the loading behavior of the
   SO-pretreated filter with polydisperse particles is much the same as
   that with monodisperse particles. However, the clogging point of the
   SO-pretreated filter with polydisperse particles is higher than that
   with monodisperse equal size. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Results: Twenty-four patients completed baseline QOL questionnaires. Six
   subsequent assessments were given to patients who were available for
   follow-up. Social/family well-being and relationship with doctor
   subscores were not significantly different from baseline. Emotional
   well-being was not different from baseline initially, but actually
   showed a significant increase 6 months after completion of radiation,
   seen on assessments 5 and 6 (P < 0.01). Physical and functional
   well-being subscores, total FACT-G score, head and neck subscores, and
   total FACT H-N score all showed initial decreases during, at the
   completion of radiation, or, in some subscores, up to 3 months
   postradiation. However, all these scores recovered to baseline levels.
   These scores subsequently showed a significant increase after 6 months
   to I year in all but the physical well-being and head and neck
   subscores, which remained at baseline.
   Conclusion: QOL scores returned to baseline levels or increased at 6 to
   12 months postradiation in long-term survivors who completed QOL

Abstract = {{The submarine sewage outfall of Santos (SSOS) is situated in the Santos
   Bay (Sao Paulo, Brazil) and is potentially a significant source of
   contaminants to the adjacent marine ecosystem. The present study aimed
   to assess the influence of SSOS on the sediment toxicity and
   contamination at Santos Bay. At the disposal site, sediments tended to
   be finer, organically richer and exhibited higher levels of surfactants
   and metals, sometimes exceeding the ``Threshold Effect Level{''} values.
   The SSOS influence was more evident toward the East, where the sediments
   exhibited higher levels of TOC, total S and metals during the summer
   2000 sampling campaign. Sediment toxicity to amphipods was consistently
   detected in four of the five stations studied. Amphipod survival tended
   to correlate negatively to Hg, total N and \% mud. This work provides
   evidence that the SSOS discharge affects the quality of sediments from
   Santos Bay, and that control procedures are warranted. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the effects of postmenopausal hormone replacement
   therapy (HRT) on intraocular pressure (TOP).
   Patients and Methods: This was a cross-sectional controlled study,
   including 107 women aged 60 to 80 years receiving HRT and 107 controls
   who have never received HRT. All subjects underwent TOP assessment and
   funduscopic photography for cup-to-disc (C/D) ratios, and completed
   questionnaires regarding personal and family history of glaucoma,
   hormone replacement therapy, lifetime estrogen and progesterone
   exposure, and cardiovascular risk factors. Main Outcome Measures
   included TOP, prevalence of increased TOP, and C/D ratios.
   Results: The groups did not differ in mean TOP (15.3 versus 15.3 mm Hg),
   mean vertical (0.18 versus 0.21) and horizontal (0.17 versus 0.14) C/D
   ratios, and in prevalence of increased TOP (15\% versus 14\%), C/D ratio
   (7\% versus 7\%), or glaucoma (9\% versus 11\%). A personal history of
   ischemic heart disease was the only risk factor associated with
   increased TOP (O.R. 4.63, P = 0.003). Lifetime estrogen and progesterone
   exposure, including pregnancies, deliveries, menstruation years, and the
   use of oral contraceptives did not significantly affect the risk for
   increased TOP.
   Conclusion: Hormone replacement therapy and lifetime estrogen and
   progesterone exposure do not seem to affect TOP or the risk for
   increased TOP. A personal history of ischemic heart disease may be
   associated with a higher risk for this disorder.}},

Title = {{Importance of the seed bank for population viability and population

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},

Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Although demographic models have become increasingly important tools in
   plant conservation, few models have considered the implications of seed
   banks for population persistence. Based on a 15-year study of the
   threatened herb, Helenium virginicum, we created a stage-class
   transition matrix to model the population dynamics of the plant. Our
   goal was to determine the role of the seed bank in population
   persistence and in the design of monitoring programs for the plant.
   Using data from marked plants, a long-term study of seed viability, and
   a seed bank census, we created a deterministic model and three
   stochastic models. The stochastic models were a model in which yearly
   correlations among parameters were retained, a model in which parameters
   were uncorrelated, and a model in which parameters were derived from
   log-normal distribution. We also constructed a fourth model in which we
   assumed a minimum seed lifetime consistent with the seed viability data.
   Both elasticity and perturbation analysis suggested that seed survival
   within the seed bank had by far the largest effects on the population
   growth rate (lambda), with 47-64\% of the change in lambda being
   controlled by seed survival. Correlations among life history parameters
   had little effect on lambda in the original models, but substantially
   reduced lambda (from 0.97 to 0.86) when seed survival was limited. Given
   the importance of the seed bank and the high yearly variability in adult
   plant density, we used simulations to compare power to detect declines
   with seed bank samples versus censuses of adult plants. The power of
   adult plant censuses was extremely low (13-22\%). The power of seed bank
   censuses was substantially higher (48-59\%), but was limited by large
   pulses of recruitment to the seed bank in good years. Power was only
   moderately reduced when seeds were sampled every two or four years
   instead of yearly (from 59\% to 48\%). Together, our results suggest
   that seed survival is crucial to persistence of Helenium populations and
   that future empirical studies should focus on understanding the factors
   that affect seed survival. In addition, managers should consider seed
   bank censuses rather than above-ground plants when designing monitoring
   programs for plants in variable environments where above-ground plants
   vary greatly from year to year. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The tegumental structures of two types of tetraphyllidean plerocercoids
   and two types of merocercoids (Phyllobothrium delphini and Monorygma
   grimaldii) from Mediterranean striped dolphins, Stenella coeruleoalba,
   are described for the first time using scanning electron microscopy. The
   tegument of all of the specimens was fully covered with microtriches.
   Four basic types were found: filitriches, blade-like spinitriches of
   different sizes and shapes, cone-shaped spinitriches (with two parallel
   small projections of equal length at the apex), and crowned cylindrical
   spinitriches (with 6-7 small papillae forming a crown at the apex); the
   two latter types are newly described. The two types of plerocercoids had
   a similar morphology and distribution of microtriches; in addition,
   cilium-like projections appeared interspersed among the microtriches on
   the apical sucker, accessory suckers, and distal bothridial loculus.
   Merocercoids exhibited a greater variety of tegumental structures,
   especially on the distal bothridial loculus. Both merocercoid types had
   regularly spaced papillae or ``buttons{''} on the accessory suckers and
   the distal bothridial loculus that were composed of a central
   cilium-like projection surrounded by numerous filitriches. However,
   crowned cylindrical spinitriches were specific to P. delphini and
   cone-shaped spinitriches were specific to M. grimaldii. Differences in
   the morphology and distribution of scolex microtriches of adult cestodes
   have been considered useful for species identification. A previous
   molecular study has suggested that P. delphini and M. grimaldii are
   actually different congeneric species. Our study has shown that
   significant differences in the morphology and distribution of
   microtriches occur between these species at the merocercoid stage.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - Diabetes, the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in
   the U:S., is believed to involve activation of the renin angiotensin
   system (PAS) as a risk factor for nephropathy. RAS activation occurs in
   healthy women using oral contraceptives (OCs), but the effects of OC use
   on the diabetic kidney are unclear.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Renal plasma flow (RPF) response to
   captopril, as an index of PAS activity, was investigated in 92 women (41
   nondiabetic OC nonusers, 10 nondiabetic OC users, 29 diabetic OC
   nonusers, and 12 diabetic OC users). Based on the hemodynamic findings,
   we examined the impact of OC use on the development of nephropathy as a
   post hoc analysis in an inception cohort of 114 female patients with
   newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes followed for a median of 20.7 years
   (range 1-24).
   RESULTS - Nondiabetic OC nonusers showed minimal RPF vasodilator
   response to captopril (9 +/- 10 ml (.) min(-1) (.) 1.73 m(-2), p = 0.6).
   In comparison, nondiabetic OC users showed a significant increase (69 -
   35 ml - min(-1) - 1.73 m(-2), p = 0.02) (P = 0.04 vs. riondiabetic OC
   nonusers). Diabetic OC nonusers demonstrated the anticipated vasodilator
   response (58 +/- 12 ml (.) min(-1) (.) 1.73 m(-2), p < 0.0001). Diabetic
   OC users showed the largest responses (84 +/- 12 ml (.) min(-1) (.) 1.73
   m(-2), p = 0.602) (P = 0.04 vs. diabetic OC nonusers). Plasma renin
   activity did not vary with OC use (P = 0.3). The RPF responses to
   captopril and angiotensin receptor blocker were highly correlated (r =
   0.72, P < 0.001), Suggesting clear involvement Of the RAS. In the
   observational study, 18\% (6/33 {[}95\% CI 4.3-32.1]) of OC users
   developed macroalbuminuria compared with 2\% (2/81 {[}0-5.9]) of OC
   nonusers (P = 0.003, univariate analysis). After adjustment for known
   risk factors with a Cox regression model, OC use remained a predictor
   for the development of macroalbuminuria (relative risk 8.00 {[}95\%CI
   1.79-44.36], P = 0.008).
   CONCLUSIONS - The strong association of OC use with
   angiotensin-dependent control of the renal circulation and the
   development of macroalbuminuria suggest that OC use may be a risk factor
   for diabetic nephropathy. Large prospective studies are required to
   further investigate this relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Acute and long-term hormonal and neuromuscular adaptations to
   hypertrophic strength training were studied in 13 recreationally
   strengthtrained men. The experimental design comprised a 6-month
   bypertrophic strength-training period including 2 separate 3month
   training periods with the crossover design, a training protocol of short
   rest (SR, 2 minutes) as compared with long rest (1,11, 5 minutes)
   between the sets. Basal hormonal concentrations of serum total
   testosterone (T), free testosterone (FT), and cortisol (C), maximal
   isometric strength of the leg extensors, right leg 1 repetition maximum
   (1RM), dietary analysis, and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) of the
   quadriceps femoris by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were measured at
   months 0, 3, and 6. The 2 hypertrophic training protocols used in
   training for the leg extensors (leg presses and squats with 10RM sets)
   were also examined in the laboratory conditions at months 0, 3, and 6.
   The exercise protocols were similar with regard to the total volume of
   work (loads X sets X reps), but differed with regard to the intensity
   and the length of rest between the sets (higher intensity and longer
   rest of 5 minutes vs. somewhat lower intensity but shorter rest of 2
   minutes). Before and immediately after the protocols, maximal isometric
   force and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the leg extensors were
   measured and blood samples were drawn for determination of serum T, FT,
   C, and growth hormone (GH) concentrations and blood lactate. Both
   protocols before the experimental training period (month 0) led to large
   acute increases (p < 0.05-0.001) in serum T, FT, C, and GH
   concentrations, as well as to large acute decreases (p < 0.05-0.001) in
   maximal isometric force and EMG activity. However, no significant
   differences were observed between the protocols. Significant increases
   of 7\% in maximal isometric force, 16\% in the right leg 1RM, and 4\% in
   the muscle CSA of the quadriceps femoris were observed during the
   6-month strength-training period. However, both 3-month training periods
   performed with either the longer or the shorter rest periods between the
   sets resulted in similar gains in muscle mass and strength. No
   statistically significant changes were observed in basal hormone
   concentrations or in the profiles of acute hormonal responses during the
   entire 6-month experimental training period. The present study indicated
   that, within typical hypertrophic strength-training protocols used in
   the present study, the length of the recovery times between the sets (2
   vs. 5 minutes) did not have an influence on the magnitude of acute
   hormonal and neuromuscular responses or long-term training adaptations
   in muscle strength and mass in previously strengthtrained men.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Inevitable trade-offs in structure may be a basis
   for differentiation in plant strategies. Juvenile trees in different
   functional groups are characterized by specific suites of structural
   traits such as crown architecture and biomass distribution. The
   relationship between juvenile tree structure and function was tested to
   find out if it is robust among functionally and taxonomically similar
   species of the genus Shorea that coexist sympatrically in a tropical
   rain forest in Borneo.
   Methods The sapling structures of 18 species were compared for
   standardized dry masses of 5 and 30 g. Pairwise simple correlation and
   multiple correlation patterns among structural traits of juveniles (0.1
   - 1.5m in height) of 18 Shorea species were examined using Pearson's
   correlation and principal component analysis ( PCA), respectively. The
   correlation was then tested between the PCA results and three indices of
   shade tolerance: the net photosynthetic rate, the wood density of mature
   trees and seed size.
   Key Results The structural variation in saplings of the genus Shorea was
   as large as that found in sets of species with much more diverse
   origins. The PCA showed that both crown architecture and allocation to
   leaves are major sources of variation in the structures of the 18
   species investigated. Of these two axes, allocation to leaves was
   significantly correlated with wood density and showed a limited
   correlation with photosynthetic rate, whereas crown architecture was
   significantly correlated to seed size.
   Conclusions Overall, the results suggest that an allocation trade-off
   between leaves and other organs, which co-varied with wood density and
   to a certain extent with photosynthetic capacity, accounts for the
   difference in shade tolerance among congeneric, functionally similar
   species. In contrast, the relationship between the architecture and
   regeneration strategy differed from the pattern found between functional
   groups, and the function of crown architecture was ambiguous.}},

Abstract = {{We have analyzed the high-resolution ultraviolet (UV) emission spectrum
   of molecular deuterium hydride (HD) excited by electron impact at 100 eV
   under optically thin, single-scattering experimental conditions. The
   high-resolution spectrum (FWHM = 160 m angstrom) spans the wavelength
   range from 900 to 1650 angstrom and contains the two Rydberg series of
   HD: (1)Sigma(+)(u) 1s sigma, np sigma(B, B', B `', n = 2, 3, 4) --> X
   (1)Sigma(+)(g) and (1)Pi(+)(u)1s sigma, np pi(C, D', D `', D `', n = 2,
   3, 4, 5) --> X (1)Sigma(+)(g). A model spectrum of HD, based on newly
   calculated transition probabilities and line positions including
   rovibrational coupling for the strongest band systems, B 1 Sigma(+)(u)-
   X (1)Sigma(g)(+), B' (1)Sigma(+)(u)- X (1)Sigma(+)(g), C (1)Pi(u) - X
   (1)Sigma(+)(g), and D (1)Pi(u) X (1)Sigma(+)(g), is in excellent
   agreement with observed intensities. The cross sections for direct
   excitation at 100 eV of the B (1)Sigma(+)(u), B' (1)Sigma(+)(u), C
   (1)Pi(u), and D (1)Pi(u) states were derived from a model analysis of
   the experimental fluorescence spectrum to the ground state. The absolute
   cross section values for excitation to the B (1)Sigma(+)(u), B'
   (1)Sigma(+)(u), C (1)Pi(u), and D (1)Pi(u) states were found to be (2.57
   +/- 0.26) x 10(-17), (0.22 +/- 0.06) x 10(-17), (2.54 +/- 0,25) x
   10(-17), and (0.17 +/- 0.04) x 10(-17) cm(2), respectively. We have also
   determined the dissociative excitation cross sections at 100 eV for the
   emission of Ly alpha at 1216 angstrom and Ly beta at 1025 angstrom
   lines, which are (7.98 +/- 1.12) x 10(-18) and (0.40 +/- 0.10) x 10(-18)
   cm(2), respectively. The summed excitation function of the closely
   spaced pair of lines, H Ly alpha and D Ly alpha, resulting from
   dissociative excitation of HD, has been measured from the threshold to
   800 eV and is analytically modeled with a semiempirical relation. The
   model cross sections are in good agreement with the corrected Ly alpha
   cross sections of Mohlmann et al. up to 2 keV. Based on measurements of
   H, D (2s) production cross section values by Mohlmann et al., the H, D
   (n = 2) cross section is estimated to be 1.6 x 10(-17) cm(2) at 100 eV.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical computations were carried out to clarify the effect of Kelvin
   force on the flow of water in a vertical cylindrical enclosure heated
   from below and cooled from above under a vertical magnetic field
   gradient. Since the Kelvin force that is produced by the magnetic field
   gradient depends on the position and the size of a circular electric
   coil, the coil was placed at either the hot or the cold plate and the
   coil diameter was set to be 2.5 or 5 times that of the enclosure. First,
   to understand the mechanism of the generation of the magnetothermal
   convection induced by the Kelvin force alone, the transition of velocity
   and temperature fields were visualized under a non-gravitational field.
   Under a gravitational field, the average Nusselt number decreased with
   increase of magnetic strength when the coil was placed at the lower end
   plate which was heated isothermally so that the generation of natural
   convection was suppressed by the Kelvin force. On the contrary, the
   average Nusselt number increased with increase of magnetic strength when
   the coil was placed at the upper end plate which was cooled isothermally
   so that the natural convection was enhanced by the Kelvin force. (c)

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the existence of a preattentively evoked
   somatosensory mismatch negativity component and to investigate the use
   of that component in objective clinical diagnostics.
   Methods: First we determined the temporal discrimination threshold (DT)
   of paired stimuli in each subject, and applied two sequential electrical
   stimuli to the hand with paired stimulus times of (1) DT -10 ms, (2) DT
   -30 ms and (3) DT +50 ms. Then, we recorded ERPs using an oddball
   paradigm, frequent (standard) and rare (deviant). We used two stimuli,
   DT-30 ms and DT-10 ms, in the first experiment, and DT -30 ms and DT +50
   ms, in the second experiment.
   Results: In each experiment, two specific components, a negative
   component peaking at approximately 60 ms (N60) and a large positive
   component peaking around 100-200 ms (P150), were identified, mainly
   following the deviant stimulus, which were considered somatosensory
   mismatch components. N60 was more remarkably identified in the second
   experiment and P150 in the first.
   Conclusions: N60 might be generated during tasks which subjects can
   clearly discriminate, but P150, which seems to correspond to auditory
   mismatch negativity, might be generated in tasks which require fine
   discrimination.
   Significance: We confirmed that our new method could be used for the
   objective examination of temporal discrimination. (c) 2005 International

   patients diagnosed as brucellosis and 11 aged-matched healthy volunteers
   were included in the study. CD3(+)CD4(+) T lymphocytes levels were
   significantly lower in patients with brucellosis as compared to the
   control group. CD3(+)CD8(+) T lymphocytes and CD3(+)IFN-gamma(+) levels
   were increased in brucellosis patients compared with the control group.
   CD4(+)IFN-gamma(+) and CD4(+)IL-4(+) levels were no different between
   patients and healthy individuals. CD3(+)IL-4(+) levels decreased in
   patients compared with healthy controls. Pre-treatment
   CD3(+)IFN-gamma(+) levels dramatically increased in patients responsive

   the start of racket forward movement. For trunk rotation, the one-handed
   backhand players exerted a large joint moment in the front leg, whereas
   the two-handed backhand players exerted a large joint moment in the back

Abstract = {{An efficient technique to remove periodic noise from digital images via

   removing periodic frequency noise.
   Provisional experimental results are shown that demonstrate that the
   proposed filter provides good performance when compared with a similar
   Fourier filter: the notch filter. This letter, when considering a
   prototype version of a Fourier-based median filter, defines the set of

   ratios calculated were greater than 1.00 for the older versus the
   younger aged groups.
   Interpretation: The influence of donor age on success of cornea
   transplants remains unresolved. Large, multicentre prospective cohort
   studies and randomized trials are needed to decisively determine the
   impact of donor age on cornea transplant success.}},

Abstract = {{Because oxidative stress has been strongly implicated in up-regulation
   of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in ischemic
   retinopathy, we evaluated the role of NAD(P)H oxidase in causing VEGF
   overexpression and retinal neovascularization. Dihydroethidium imaging
   analyses showed increased superoxide formation in areas of retinal
   neovascularization associated with relative retinal hypoxia in a mouse
   model for oxygen-induced retinopathy. The effect of hypoxia in
   stimulating superoxide formation in retinal vascular endothelial cells
   was confirmed by in vitro chemiluminescence assays. The superoxide
   formation was blocked by specific inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase activity
   (apocynin, gp91ds-tat) indicating that NAD(P)H oxidase is a major source
   of superoxide formation. Western blot and immunolocalization analyses
   showed that retinal ischemia increased expression of the NAD(P)H oxidase
   catalytic subunit gp91phox, which localized primarily within vascular
   endothelial cells. Treatment of mice with apocynin blocked
   ischemia-induced increases in oxidative stress, normalized VEGF
   expression, and prevented retinal neovascularization. Apocynin and
   gp91ds-tat also blocked the action of hypoxia in causing increased VEGF
   expression in vitro, confirming the specific role of NAD(P)H oxidase in
   hypoxia-induced increases in VEGF expression. in conclusion, NAD(P)H
   oxidase activity is required for hypoxia-stimulated increases in VEGF
   expression and retinal neovascularization. Inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase
   offers a new therapeutic target for the treatment of retinopathy.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to chlorpyrifos (CPF) alters neuronal development of serotonin
   (5HT) and dopamine systems, and we recently found long-term alterations
   in behaviors related to 5HT function. To characterize the synaptic
   mechanisms underlying these effects, we exposed developing rats to CPF
   regimens below the threshold for systemic toxicity, in three treatment
   windows: gestational days (GD) 17-20, postnatal days (PN) 1-4, or
   PN11-14. In early adulthood (PN60),we assessed basal neurotransmitter
   content and synaptic activity (turnover) in brain regions containing the
   major 5HT and dopamine projections. CPF exposure on GD17-20 or PN1-4
   evoked long-term increases in 5HT turnover across multiple regions; the
   effects were not secondary to changes in neurotransmitter content, which
   was unaffected or even decreased. When the treatment window was shifted
   to PN11-14, there were no long-term effects. Dopamine turnover also
   showed significant increases after CPF exposure on GD17-20, but only
   when the dose was raised above the threshold for overt toxicity;
   however, hippocampal dopamine content was profoundly subnormal after
   exposures below or above the acute, toxic threshold, suggesting outright
   neurotoxicity. These results indicate that, in a critical developmental
   period, apparently nontoxic exposures to CPF produce lasting activation
   of 5HT systems in association with 5HT-associated behavioral anomalies.}},

Title = {{Onshore-offshore correlation of Pleistocene rhyolitic eruptions from New
   Zealand: implications for TVZ eruptive history and paleoenvironmental
   construction}},
Journal = {{QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{14-15}},
Pages = {{1601-1622}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), in the North Island, New Zealand, is arguably
   the most active Quaternary rhyolitic system in the world. Numerous and
   widespread rhyolitic tephra layers, sourced from the TVZ, form valuable
   chronostratigraphic markers in onshore and offshore sedimentary
   sequences. In deep-sea cores from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 181
   Sites 1125, 1124, 1123 and 1122, located east of New Zealand, ca 100
   tephra beds are recognised post-dating the Plio-Pleistocene boundary at
   1.81 Ma. These tephras have been dated by a combination of
   magnetostratigraphy, orbitally tuned stable-isotope data and isothermal
   plateau fission track ages. The widespread occurrence of ash offshore to
   the east of New Zealand is favoured by the small size of New Zealand,
   the explosivity of the mainly plinian and ignimbritic eruptions and the
   prevailing westerly wind field.
   Although some tephras can be directly attributed to known TVZ eruptions,
   there are many more tephras represented within ODP-cores that have yet
   to be recognised in near-source on-land sequences. This is due to
   proximal source area erosion and/or deep burial as well as the adverse
   effect of vapour phase alteration and devitrification within near-source
   welded ignimbrites. Despite these difficulties, a number of key deep-sea
   tephras can be reliably correlated to equivalent-aged tephra exposed in
   uplifted marine back-arc successions of Wanganui Basin where an
   excellent chronology has been developed based on magnetostratigraphy,
   orbitally calibrated sedimentary cycles and isothermal plateau fission
   track ages on tephra. Significant Pleistocene tephra markers include:
   the Kawakawa, Omataroa, Rangitawa/Onepuhi, Kaukatea, Kidnappers-B,
   Potaka, Unit D/Ahuroa, Ongatiti, Rewa, Sub-Rewa, Pakihikura, Ototoka and
   Table Flat Tephras. Six other tephra layers are correlated between
   ODP-core sites but have yet to be recognised within onshore records.
   The identification of Pleistocene TVZ-sourced tephras within the ODP
   record, and their correlation to Wanganui Basin and other onshore sites
   is a significant advance as it provides: (1) an even more detailed
   history of the TVZ than can be currently achieved from the near-source
   record, (2) a high-resolution tephrochronologic framework for future
   onshore-offshore paleoenvironmental reconstructions, and (3) well-dated
   tephra beds correlated from the offshore ODP sites with astronomically
   tuned timescales provide an opportunity to critically evaluate the
   chronostratigraphic framework for onshore Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary
   sequences (e.g. Wanganui Basin, cf. Naish et al. {[}1998. Quaternary

Abstract = {{The antiferromagnetic states of GdB6 are investigated both theoretically

   In the high-temperature phase, the observation of second-order

Journal = {{UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{66}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. To evaluate the utility of the porcine and canine models for
   collecting system closure after partial nephrectomy involving violation
   of the renal collecting system. Advanced surgical technologies and novel
   techniques for performing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy are
   frequently evaluated in an animal model.
   Methods. After evaluation of the upper urinary tract with retrograde
   pyelography, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, including violation of
   the renal collecting system, was performed in 8 domestic pigs (group 1)
   and 2 dogs (group 2) with documented normal upper urinary tract
   physiology. No collecting system closure was performed. Subsequently, in
   an attempt to generate an adequate model for renal collecting system
   closure, 6 pigs (group 3) underwent partial obstruction of the proximal
   ureter before laparoscopic partial nephrectomy without collecting system
   closure. After 3 weeks, the animals underwent evaluation, including
   retrograde pyelography, and were killed for histopathologic evaluation
   of the upper urinary tracts.
   Results. Despite documented transection of major calices in all animals,
   none with physiologically normal upper urinary tracts developed
   urinomas. After partial occlusion of the proximal ureter, all pigs had
   hydronephrosis, but only one of six developed a urinoma.
   Conclusions. The porcine and canine models are inadequate for evaluating
   renal collecting system closure after partial nephrectomy. Our
   high-pressure partial occlusion model was similarly inadequate. The
   limitations of these animal models should be considered when reviewing
   published data regarding technologies for partial nephrectomy. Future
   data regarding novel technologies for partial nephrectomy should also be
   carefully considered before clinical application.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly perfect adherence to demanding antiretroviral therapy ( ART) is
   now recognized as essential for HIV-positive patients to realize its

   non-adherence, a large number of patients do not follow their ART
   regimen. While many factors influence adherence, the literature is
   dominated by studies on only one or a small set of them. Multivariate,
   theory-based models of adherence behavior are of great interest. The
   current study tested one such model, the Information, Motivation and
   Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of ART adherence ( Fisher et al., under

Abstract = {{The reactors of Taylor-Couette type are relatively recent application in
   the engineering processes field. The stability and the flow structure in
   this device are examined under the effect combined of the free surface
   and the fluid's height in annular space. The exploitation of the flow
   regimes is carried out according to the number of Taylor for various
   values of aspect ration Gamma. By means of ultrasonic velocimetry (UPV)
   we determine axial average velocity profile and the axial wavelength. We
   also carry out the spectral analysis by Fourier's fast transform of the
   fluctuations associated with the average velocity values in order to
   analyze the flow structure. We particularly aim for checking the
   presence or the absence of the azimuth wave according to the filling
   height and the rotational velocity imposed. We highlight the effects of
   free surface and aspect ratio on the conditions of appearance of the
   second instability ( wavy mode). The analysis of the fluctuation shows
   that the appearance of the azimuth wave regime (Wavy mode) is delayed
   when the aspect ration decreases. Below a critical value noted Gamma c =
   10, the azimuth wave regime is not observed any more.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) is an antiturnour molecule produced in activated
   macrophages and Solanurn nigrum is a plant used in oriental medicine to
   treat tumours. In this study using mouse peritoneal macrophages, we have
   examined the mechanism by which Solanum nigrum regulates NO production.
   When Solanum nigrum was used in combination with 20 U/ml of recombinant
   interferon-gamma (rlFN-gamma), there was a marked cooperative induction
   of NO production. The increase in NO synthesis was reflected as an
   increased amount of inducible NO synthase (NOS) protein. The production
   of NO from rIFN-gamma plus Solanurn nigrum-stimulated peritoneal
   macrophages was decreased by treatment with N-G-monomethyl-(L)-arginine
   or N-alpha-tosyl-Phe chloromethyl ketone, an NOS inhibitor.
   Additionally, the increased production of NO from rIFN-gamma plus
   Solanum nigrum-stimulated cells was almost completely inhibited by
   pretreatment with 100 mu mol/l of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, an
   inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Furthermore, Solanum
   nigrum increased activation of NF-kappa B. These findings suggest that
   Solanum nigrum, increases the production of NO by rIFISI-gamma-primed
   macrophages and NF-kappa B plays a critical role in mediating these
   effects. European Journal of Cancer Prevention 14:345-350 (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Six species of abalones (Haliotidae) are found on the Korean coasts.
   Identification and characterization of these abalones are usually based

   sequences of the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I genes to identify species using molecular data and to
   determine their phylogenetic relationships. Sequence alignments and
   phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 6 species fell into 2 distinct
   groups which were genetically distant from each other and exhibited
   little internal phylogenetic resolution. One group included Haliotis
   discus hannai, H. discus discus, H. madaka, and H. gigantea, while the
   other group contained H. diversicolor supertexta and H. diversicolor
   diversicolor. The 16S rRNA sequences were relatively more conserved than
   to the COI sequences, but both gene sequences provided sufficient
   phylogenetic information to distinguish among the 6 species of Pacific
   abalone, and thus could be valuable molecular characters for species
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{A tetraglucose oligomer, Glc alpha 1-6Glc alpha 1-4Glc alpha 1-4Glc,
   designated Glc(4), has been shown to be a putative biomarker for the
   diagnosis of Pompe disease. The purpose of this study was to assess
   whether Glc(4) could be used to monitor the therapeutic response to
   recombinant human acid alpha glucosidase (rhGAA) enzyme replacement
   therapy (ERT) in patients with Pompe disease. Urinary Glc(4) levels in I
   I patients receiving rhGAA therapy was determined by both HPLC-UV and
   stable isotope dilution ESI-MS/MS. Combined Glc(4) and maltotetraose,
   Glc alpha 1-4Glc alpha 1-4Glc alpha 1-4Glc, (M-4) concentrations,
   designated Hex(4), in plasma from these patients were measured by
   HPLC-UV only. Baseline urinary Glc4 and plasma Hex(4) in these patients
   (mean +/- SD: 34.2 +/- 11.3 mmol/mol creatinine and 1.7 +/- 0.8 mu M,
   respectively) were higher than age-matched control values (mean +/- SE),
   6.1 +/- 5.1 mmol/mol creatinine and 0.22 +/- 0.15 mu M, respectively).
   Both urinary Glc4 and plasma Hex(4) levels decreased after initiation of
   ERT for all patients. In the four patients with the best overall
   clinical response in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, levels decreased
   to within, or near, normal levels during the first year of treatment. In
   contrast, levels fluctuated and were persistently elevated above the
   control ranges in those patients with a less favorable clinical response
   (good cardiac response but limited motor improvement). These results
   suggest that urinary Glc(4) and plasma Hex(4) could serve as a valuable
   adjunct to clinical endpoints for monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic
   interventions such as rhGAA ERT in Pompe disease. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{We empirically investigate the evolution of liquidity, as well as the
   changing strategies of informed traders, over the course of the trading
   day. In particular, we empirically examine the relative use of market
   versus limit orders by informed and liquidity traders early versus later
   in the trading day using detailed order and audit trail data from the
   NYSE. Our study complements experimental research that shows that
   informed traders tend to take liquidity earlier in the trading day while
   acting as liquidity suppliers later in the day. We find that informed
   (i.e., institutional) traders actually use market orders more often in
   the first half of the day than the second. We also find support for
   informed traders' use of limit orders. Limit orders placed by informed
   traders perform better than those placed by uninformed (i.e.,
   individual) traders. Our findings serve to underscore the importance of
   developing new theoretical models to more accurately reflect the
   changing and complex trading milieu. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Accurate digital terrain models (DTMs) are necessary for a variety of
   forest resource management applications, including watershed management,
   timber harvest planning, and fire management. Traditional methods for
   acquiring topographic data typically rely on aerial photogrammetry,
   where measurement of the terrain surface below forest canopy is
   difficult and error prone. The recent emergence of airborne P-band
   interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR), a high-resolution,
   microwave remote sensing technology, has the potential to provide
   significantly more accurate terrain models in forested areas.
   Low-frequency, P-band radar energy physically penetrates through the
   vegetation canopy and reflects from the underlying terrain surface,
   allowing for accurate measurement of the terrain surface elevation even
   in areas with dense forest cover. In this study, the accuracy of a
   high-resolution DTM derived from P-band IFSAR data collected over a
   mountainous forest area in western Washington State was rigorously
   evaluated through a comparison with 347 topographic checkpoints measured
   with total station survey equipment and collected under a variety of
   canopy densities. The mean DTM error was -0.28 +/- 2.59 m (mean +/-
   standard deviation), and the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 2.6 m.
   DTM elevation errors for four canopy cover classes were -0.67 +/- 1.20 m
   (RMSE = 1.38 m) for clearcut, -0.62 +/- 1.00 m (RMSE = 1.18 m) for
   heavily thinned, -0.41 +/- 2.32 m (RMSE = 2.36 m) for lightly thinned,

Abstract = {{Trains running in built-up areas are a source to ground-borne noise. A
   careful design of the track may be one way of minimizing the vibrations
   in the surroundings. For example, open or infilled trenches may be
   constructed along the track, or the soil underneath the track may be
   improved. In this work, the influence of the track design and properties
   on the level of ground vibration due to a vehicle moving with subsonic
   speed is examined. A coupled finite element-boundary element model of
   the track and subsoil is employed, adopting a formulation in the moving
   frame of reference following the vehicle. The computations are carried
   out in the frequency domain for various combinations of the vehicle
   speed and the excitation frequency. The analyses indicate that open
   trenches are more efficient than infilled trenches or soil

Abstract = {{The electronic interaction between the transparent anode material indium
   tin oxide (ITO) and the common organic hole injection material copper
   phtalocyanine has been investigated by means of angle-resolved UV
   photoemission. The study was made on two differently treated ITO
   substrates, both cleaned in common organic solvents and one of them
   heated in air after the cleaning. The heat treatment efficiently removes
   surface carbon-containing contamination, and has also an oxidizing
   effect. As a result, the ITO work function is increased by 0.4-0.6 eV.
   This surface preparation has significant impact on the electronic
   properties of adsorbed CuPc. We find that the Pc HOMO level, important
   for transport properties, is shifting by 0.5 eV depending on surface
   conditions. This is interpreted as an effect of Fermi level pinning
   within the gap of the spin-split Cu derived bl(g) molecular orbitals.

   yeast complex, MRX (Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2), is not required for the
   intra-S-phase checkpoint in response to DNA alkylation damage, but is
   required in the presence of double-stranded DNA breaks. These data
   indicate, at least in budding yeast, that alternate pathways enforce
   replication slowing depending on the particular DNA lesion.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we prove the validity of an Edgeworth expansion to the
   distribution of the Whittle maximum likelihood estimator for stationary
   long-memory Gaussian models with unknown parameter theta is an element
   of Theta subset of R-d theta. The error of the (s - 2) -order expansion
   is shown to be o(n(-(s-2)/2))-the usual independent and identically
   distributed rate-for a wide range of models, including the popular
   ARFIMA(p,d,q) models. The expansion is valid under mild assumptions on
   the behavior of the spectral density and its derivatives in the
   neighborhood of the origin. As a by-product, we generalize a theorem by
   Fox and Taqqu (1987, Probability Theory and Related Fields 74, 213-240)
   concerning the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices.
   Lieberman, Rousseau, and Zucker (2003, Annals of Statistics 31, 586-612)
   establish a valid Edgeworth expansion for the maximum likelihood
   estimator for stationary long-memory Gaussian models. For a significant
   class of models, their expansion is shown to have an error of o(n(-1)).
   The results given here improve upon those of Lieberman et al. in that
   the results provide an Edgeworth expansion for an asymptotically
   efficient estimator, as Lieberman et al. do, but the error of the
   expansion is shown to be o(n(-(s-2)/2)), not o(n(-1)), for a broad range

Abstract = {{Phosphorylation of twitchin is known to abolish the catch state of
   anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) of the bivalve mollusc Mytilus
   edulis. To investigate the role of myosin head involvement in force
   maintenance during catch, the effect of twitchin phosphorylation on
   myosin head detachment was studied in saponin-skinned fibre bundles of
   ABRM. The detachment rate of myosin heads was deduced from two types of
   experiments: (1) force decay after stepwise stretch of maximally
   Ca2+-activated fibre bundles (pCa 4.5) and (2) force decay from
   high-force rigor, the former induced by a stepwise increase in ATP
   concentration elicited by photolysis of caged ATP (pCa < 8). The rate of
   detachment was not affected by thiophosphorylation or phosphorylation of
   twitchin by 0.12 mM cAMP in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor
   cyclosporine A (1 mu M). Conversely, measurements of the rate of
   stretch-induced delayed force increase (stretch activation) and of the
   force increase following an ATP step in low-force rigor (pCa 4.5)
   suggest that the rate of myosin head attachment decreases after twitchin
   phosphorylation. We conclude that catch is not due to myosin heads
   remaining attached to actin filaments, but depends on myofilament
   interconnections that break down when twitchin is phosphorylated.}},

   California cemetery (CA-SCL-674) lack forearm bones. Twelve of these
   otherwise well-articulated primary interments have distal humeri bearing
   cutmarks with a distribution like that seen in fur seals butchered by
   Native Californians. Most of the burials with missing forearms are young
   adult males, a demographic profile that differs significantly from the
   full sample. Three of these males show evidence of perimortem trauma in
   addition to forearm amputation. Drilled and polished human radii and
   ulnae were recovered from the CA-SCL-674 cemetery in archaeological
   contexts separate from burials with missing forearms. A warfare-related
   trophy-taking practice is strongly suggested by these bioarchaeological
   data. Based on these data, it seems likely that 20\% (N = 10) or more of
   the adult males (N = 59) in this population were victims of violence.
   Evidence of perimortem violence was much less common among women, with
   only about 2\% (N = 2) of adult females (N = 86) subjected to
   trophy-taking. Examination of museum collections produced further
   evidence for perimortem forearm amputation among the Native American
   inhabitants of this area during the transition between the Early and
   Middle periods. The emergence of more hierarchical social systems during
   this period may have fostered warfare-related trophy-taking as a
   symbolic tool for enhancing the power and prestige of individuals within
   competing social groups. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Copper(II) complexes of three linear unsymmetrical tridentate ligands
   viz. N-methyl-N'-(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)ethylenediamine (L1),
   N,N-dimethyl-N'-(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)ethylenediamine (L2) and
   N,N-dimethyl-N'-((6-methyl)pyrid-2-ylmethyl)ethylenediamine (U) have
   been isolated and characterized by elemental analysis, electronic
   absorption and EPR spectroscopy and cyclic and differential pulse
   voltammetry. Of these complexes {[}Cu(L2)Cl-2] and {[}Cu(L3)Cl-2] have
   been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. The
   {[}Cu(L2)Cl-2] complex crystallizes in the monoclinic space group
   P2(1)/n with a = 11.566(2) angstrom, b = 7.369(l) angstrom, c =
   15.703(3) angstrom, alpha = 90 degrees, beta = 109.68(8)degrees, gamma =
   90 degrees and Z = 4 while {[}Cu(L-3)Cl-2] crystallizes in the triclinic
   space group P (1) over bar with a = 9.191(2) angstrom b = 12.359(3)
   angstrom, c = 14.880(3) angstrom, alpha = 79.61(13)degrees, beta =
   86.64(13)degrees, gamma = 87.28(8)degrees and Z = 2. The coordination
   geometries around copper (11) in these two complexes are best described
   as trigonal bipyramidal distorted square based pyramidal (TBDSBP). The
   distorted CuN3Cl basal plane in them is comprised of three nitrogen
   atoms of the meridionally coordinated ligand and a chloride ion and the
   axial position is occupied by the other chloride ion. The interaction of
   these complexes with Calf Thymus DNA (CT DNA) has been studied by using
   absorption, emission and circular dichroic spectral methods, thermal
   denaturation studies, viscometry and cyclic and differential pulse
   voltammetry. A strong blueshift in the ligand field band and a redshift
   in the ligand based bands of the copper(II) complexes on binding to DNA
   imply a covalent mode of DNA binding of the complexes, which involves
   coordination of most possibly guanine N7 nitrogen of DNA to form a CuN4
   chromophore. This is supported by studying the interaction of the
   complexes with N-methylimidazole (N-meim), guanosine monophosphate
   (GNIP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and cytidine (cytd) by ligand
   field and EPR spectral methods, which indicate the formation of a CuN4
   chromophore only in the case of the more basic N-meim and GNIP. The DNA
   melting curves obtained in the presence of copper(II) complexes reveal a
   monophasic and irreversible melting of the DNA strands and the high
   positive Delta T-m values (12-21 degrees C) also support the formation
   of strong Cu-N bonds by the complexes with DNA, leading to intra- and/or
   interstrand crosslinking of DNA. Competitive ethidium bromide (EthBr)
   binding studies show that the L2 and L3 complexes are less efficient
   than the L1 complex in quenching EthBr emission, which is consistent
   with their forming DNA crosslinking preventing the displacement of the
   DNA-bound EthBr. A very slight decrease in relative viscosity of DNA is
   observed on treating the L1 and L2 complexes with CT DNA; however, a
   relatively significant decrease is observed for the L3 complex
   suggesting-that the length of the DNA fiber is shortened. DNA cleavage
   experiments show that all the complexes induce the cleavage of pBR322
   plasmid DNA, the complex of L1 being more efficient than those of
   sterically hindered L2 and L3 ligands. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Several studies indicate that organ failure is the leading
   cause of death in the postoperative phase after major surgery. An
   excessive inflammatory response followed by a dramatic depression of
   cell-mediated immunity after major surgery appears to be responsible for
   the increased susceptibility to subsequent sepsis. In view of this, most
   of the scientific and medical research has been directed towards
   measuring the progression and interrelationship of mediators after major
   surgery. Furthermore, the effect of those mediators on cell-mediated
   immune responses has been studied. Objective: This article focuses on
   the effect of surgical injury and blood loss on cell-mediated immune
   responses in experimental studies utilizing models of trauma and
   hemorrhagic shock. The findings from those experimental studies will
   also be correlated with data from surgical patients. Results: Recently,
   a gender-dimorphic immune and organ responsiveness in the susceptibility
   to and morbidity from shock, trauma, and sepsis has been found.
   Androgens have been shown to be responsible for the immunosuppression
   after trauma-hemorrhage in males. In contrast, female sex steroids
   exhibit immunoprotective properties after trauma and severe blood loss.
   Conclusion: In view of these findings, clinically relevant therapeutic
   strategies have been developed using the testosterone receptor blocker
   flutamide and/or estrogen or agents with estrogenic effects, i.e.,
   dehydroepiandrosterone, which might yield safe and useful therapeutic
   approaches for the treatment of immune depression in surgical patients.}},

Abstract = {{The composition of glucan-associated proteins (GAP) in the cell wall of

   P-glucan synthesis inhibitory concentration (0.01 mu g/ml) of FK463
   (micafungin). Namely, a decrease in enzymes of glucose metabolism
   (mostly enolase and a novel 40 kDaltons component, here identified as
   the enzyme fructose-1,6-biphosphate aldolase) was observed, and this was
   coupled with an increase in two beta 1-3 exo-glucanase isoforms (34 and
   44 kDa, respectively). No GAP changes were detected in the same strain
   of the fungus made resistant to the drug, attesting to the specificity
   of the observed cell wall protein modulation. In addition, GAP changes
   were accompanied by marked ultrastructural alterations upon treatment
   with the sub-MIC dose of the drug, the majority of which was an aberrant
   cell surface morphology and a derangement of the normal layering of the

Abstract = {{Many chemicals that adversely affect reproduction and/or development do
   so through multiple pathways within the reproductive tract and
   hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Notable in this regard are
   fungicides, such as prochloraz or fenarimol, which in mammals have the
   potential to impact endocrine function through inhibition of CYP enzymes
   involved in steroid metabolism, as well as through antagonism of the
   androgen receptor(s). The objective of our studies was to assess the
   effects of prochloraz and fenarimol on reproductive endocrine function
   in a model small fish species, the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas),
   using both in vitro and in vivo assays. The two fungicides inhibited in
   vitro CYP19 aromatase activity in brain and ovarian homogenates from the
   fish, with prochloraz exhibiting a greater potency than fenarimol.
   Prochloraz and fenarimol also bound competitively to the cloned fathead
   minnow androgen receptor expressed in COS-1 cells. The two fungicides
   significantly reduced fecundity of the fish in a 21-day reproduction
   assay at water concentrations of 0.1 (prochloraz) and 1.0 (fenarimol)
   mg/l. The in vivo effects of prochloraz on plasma steroid (17
   beta-estradiol, testosterone, 11-ketotestosterone) and vitellogenin (an
   estrogen-responsive protein) concentrations, as well as on gonadal
   histopathology, were consistent with inhibition of steroidogenesis.
   Fenarimol also affected several aspects of endocrine function in vivo;
   however, the suite of observed effects did not reflect either aromatase
   inhibition or androgen receptor antagonism. These studies contribute to
   a better mechanistic understanding of the extrapolation of effects of
   endocrine-disrupting chemicals across vertebrate classes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pre-eclampsia is an important cause of maternal mortality.
   Although there have been many studies worldwide on pre-eclampsia, not
   many have come from black Africa.
   Study design: A case-control study was conducted in a tertiary hospital
   in Nigeria (the black African nation with the highest population)
   between February 2001 and August 2002 to determine the risk factors for
   eclampsia. Information on socio-demographic characteristics,
   pre-pregnancy weight, medical history and previous obstetric history,
   and level of stress at home and at work was obtained by face-to-face
   interviews.
   Analysis: Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine
   the risk factors for pre-eclampsia.
   Results: One hundred and thirty seven (7.6\%) of the 1803 women who
   delivered during the period had pre-eclampsia/eclampsia. Of these, 128
   (93.4\%) were analysed. Ninety-one (71.1\%) women were primigravidae.
   Age! 19 years was not considered a risk factor. The risk factors that
   were associated with increased risk of pre-eclampsia were: nulliparity
   (OR 4.77-3 95\% CI 2.90-7.78), stressful work during pregnancy (OR 2.10;
   95\% CI 1.20-3.71), stressful home environment (OR 1.97; 95\% CI
   1.27-3.69), previous pre-eclampsia (OR 11.68; CI 3.81-37.61), history of
   chronic hypertension (OR 2.21; 95\% CI 1.17-6.20), a body weight greater
   than 80 kg (OR 2.01; 95\% CI 1.05-3.87); and multiple pregnancy (OR
   2.71; 95\% CI 1.27-6.13).
   Conclusions: Risk factors for pre-eclampsia among Nigerian women are not
   different from those that have been reported in other studies. Weight
   reduction, good control of chronic hypertension, and reduction of
   stressful conditions at home and in pregnancy could be steps towards the
   primary prevention of this disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate further in a phase III, double blind trial the
   efficacy of infliximab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis
   (PsA), as observed in the smaller IMPACT trial.
   Methods: 200 patients with active PsA unresponsive to previous treatment
   were randomised to infusions of infliximab 5 mg/kg or placebo at weeks
   0, 2, 6, 14, and 22. Patients with inadequate response entered early
   escape at week 16. The primary measure of clinical response was ACR20.
   Other measures included Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC),
   Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), and dactylitis and
   enthesopathy assessments.
   Results: At week 14, 58\% of patients receiving infliximab and 11\% of
   those receiving placebo achieved an ACR20 response and 77\% of
   infliximab patients and 27\% of placebo patients achieved PsARC (both p
   < 0.001). Among the 85\% of patients with at least 3\% body surface area
   psoriasis involvement at baseline, 53/83 (64\%) patients receiving
   infliximab had at least 75\% improvement in PASI compared with 2/87
   (2\%) patients receiving placebo at week 14 (p < 0.001). These
   therapeutic effects were maintained through the last evaluation (week
   24). Fewer infliximab patients than placebo patients had dactylitis at
   week 14 (18\% v 30\%; p=0.025) and week 24 (12\% v 34\%; p < 0.001).
   Fewer infliximab patients (22\%) than placebo patients (34\%) had active
   enthesopathy at week 14 (p=0.016); corresponding figures at week 24 were
   20\% and 37\% (p=0.002). Infliximab was generally well tolerated, with a
   similar incidence of adverse events in each group.
   Conclusions: Infliximab 5 mg/kg through 24 weeks significantly improved
   active PsA, including dactylitis and enthesopathy, and associated
   psoriasis.}},

Abstract = {{Using the polarizable molecular mechanics method SIBFA, we have
   performed a search for the most stable binding modes of D- and
   L-thioniandelate to a 104-residue model of the metallo-beta-lactamase
   from B. fragilis, an enzyme involved in the acquired resistance of
   bacteria to antibiotics. Energy balances taking into account solvation
   effects computed with a continuum reaction field procedure indicated the
   D-isomer to be more stably bound than the L-one, conform to the
   experimental result. The most stably bound complex has the S- ligand
   bridging monodentately the two Zn(II) cations and one carboxylate O-
   H-bonded to the Asn193 side chain. We have validated the SIBFA energy
   results by performing additional SIBFA as well as quantum chemical (QC)
   calculations on small (88 atoms) model complexes extracted from the
   104-residue complexes, which include the residues involved in inhibitor
   binding, Computations were done in parallel using uncorrelated (HF) as
   well as correlated (DFT, LMP2. MP2) computations, and the comparisons
   extended to corresponding captopril complexes (Antony et al., J Comput

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate single motor unit (SMU) firing patterns of the
   inferior head of the human lateral pterygoid muscle (IHLP) during
   sustained isometric contractions, and to examine IHLP fatigability.
   Design: In 5 subjects, EMG was recorded from the right IHLP during
   generation of horizontal isometric mandibular force towards left side.
   Subjects tracked a target on an oscilloscope, slowly increasing the
   force to 25\% of maximum voluntary contraction, and then maintained that
   force for 120 s (endurance task). Subjects rested for 30 s after each
   test, and three 10 s recovery tests were performed every 30 s (recovery
   task). Fatigue data were obtained from 23 SMUs.
   Results: Twelve of 23 SMUs (52.2\%) continued to fire throughout the 120
   s, and each subject had at least one of these units. These units were
   classified as tonic pattern (T-unit). The firing rate of 6 of the 12
   T-units (50.0\%) decreased gradually with time. Comparison of the mean
   firing rate and coefficient of variance (CV) of interspike interval
   (ISI) of the 12 T-units between pre-fatigue, post-fatigue and the three
   recovery tasks showed that the mean firing rate decreased and CV of ISI
   increased after fatigue. Mean firing rate and CV of ISI recovered after
   30 s of rest after the endurance task.
   Conclusions: The firing patterns of IHLP units changed with the passing
   of time during sustained isometric contractions leading to fatigue. (C)

Abstract = {{Propan-1-ol and butan-1-ol photo-degradation with TiO2 (bare-TiO2) and
   TiO2 doped with Pd or Cu has been studied in a gaseous continuous flow
   system. Exhaust gases have been analysed by means of GC and FTIR. During
   propan-1-ol and butan-1-ol degradations, catalysts were not deactivated.
   Nevertheless, important differences in concentrations and distributions
   of intermediates were obtained, depending on the catalyst studied.
   These alcohols interactions with TiO2 surface give alcoholates. However,
   their interactions with Pd-TiO2 and Cu-TiO2 do not yield alcoholates.
   Doped catalysts have progressively grown dark during the experiments,
   especially when N-2 atmospheres were used. This colour change may be
   given by the reduction of metal oxides deposited on the catalyst
   surface. These different photocatalytic behaviours may be explained by
   means of the alcoholate interaction with the catalysts surfaces, their
   ability to scavenge photogenerated electrons and react with radicals
   formed from propan-1-ol and butan-1-ol. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background: Moxifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent with
   proven efficacy against community-acquired respiratory pathogens. Common
   adverse effects associated with its use include gastrointestinal
   symptoms, but nephrotoxicity has not yet been reported to the
   manufacturer or in the literature (based on a MEDLINE search {[}key
   words: fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, kidney, interstitial, and
   nephritis; years: 1970-2005]). Objective: The purpose of this article
   was to describe a case of nephrotoxicity associated with moxifloxacin
   use.
   Methods: A 68-year-old woman weighing 65 kg was referred to our
   nephrology clinic by her general practitioner because of an acute
   increase in serum creatinine concentration (SCC). In this patient,
   biopsyproven acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) developed similar
   to 10 days after the end of moxifloxacin therapy for a nonspecific
   bronchial infection. The patient initially presented with nonspecific
   clinical symptoms, foaming of her urine, elevated erythrocyte
   sedimentation rate, and the acute increase in SCC. Urinalysis revealed
   signs of tubulointerstitial damage, including leukocyturia and
   proteinuria with a high concentration of (xi-microglobulin. Oral
   corticosteroid therapy with prednisolone was started similar to 14 days
   after symptom development, beginning at 1 mg/kg body weight QD.
   Results: After the initiation of therapy, renal function was gradually
   restored over 6 months, bur mild proteinuria persisted. Although the
   exact pathogenesis of drug-induced ATIN remains unclear, an
   immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction is the assumed mechanism.
   Conclusions: Fluoroquinolones might have a nephrotoxic effect. In this
   patient, ATIN was likely associated with moxifloxacin use. Because the
   course of ATIN is unpredictable and might lead to long-term dialysis,
   considering ATIN as a possible diagnosis in the scenario of systemic
   symptoms after moxifloxacin treatment is essential.}},

Abstract = {{This paper draws upon concepts and techniques from epidemiology to
   examine the ability of routine activities theory to account for the risk
   of criminal victimization. Moving beyond the identification of risk
   factors for victimization, we ask how changes to causal factors might
   affect the risk of victimization in the general population. We find that
   predictors identified with more traditional methods account for the bulk
   of the risk, but that some are less important for understanding overall
   population risk because of the small numbers of people associated with
   them, while others are more helpful because they apply to larger
   numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Healthy adipose tissue function depends on adipogenesis. The capacity to
   form new adipocytes prevents the emergence of insulin-resistant
   hypertrophied adipocytes, aswell as the deleterious lipid deposition in
   muscle, liver, and pancreas. It is therefore important to understand how
   adipogenesis is modulated. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is
   anti-adipogenic, but the stage of differentiation that it targets, and
   the signaling pathways that it triggers, are not defined. We have
   studied the inhibitory effect of PDGF on murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and
   human preadipocyte differentiation. There was a significant attenuation
   in the protein expression of the adipogenic transcription factors, PPAR
   gamma and C/EBP alpha, as well as in the levels of later differentiation
   markers, including adiponectin, aP2, and fatty acid synthase. PDGF
   treatment resulted in the persistence of PDGF receptor and PKC alpha
   expression, in contrast to the expected downregulation of both proteins
   that occurs during differentiation. Inactivation of conventional PKC
   isoforms, by bisindolylmaleimide I or PKC pseudosubstrate M20-28,
   partially reversed the inhibition of 3T3-L1 and human preadipocyte
   differentiation by PDGF, as assessed by fatty acid synthase expression

Abstract = {{This article describes a program for optimizing horizontal and vertical
   alignments of forest roads using Tabu search, a modern heuristic
   technique. Once a series of intersection points (IPs) is selected
   manually, the program generates alternative horizontal and vertical
   alignments. The program precisely generates ground profile and cross
   sections using a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) derived
   from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. It accurately calculates
   earthwork volumes for curved roadways using the Pappus-based method. The
   program also estimates construction and maintenance costs. Tabu search
   optimizes forest road alignments based on the total costs. The
   application of the program to part of Capitol State Forest in Washington
   State, USA, indicated that the program successfully found better
   alignments than manually selected initial alignments. The effect of
   initial solutions and the number of iterations on the Tabu search
   process was examined. The result showed that the solutions were improved
   using the best solutions with the smaller number of grade change points
   as the initial solutions. It also showed that a small number of
   iterations could be used to reduce computation time due to the fact that
   Tabu search is based on a gradient search technique. Finally, the
   Dijkstra method was examined to find initial solutions without manually
   initialized solutions. The program, when combined with the Dijkstra
   method, could find similar-quality solutions from manually initialized
   solutions. The program will become useful with further tests and
   verifications.}},

Abstract = {{Background Although not much research comparing the emotional distress
   following medical and surgical abortion is available, few studies have
   compared psychological sequelae following both methods of abortion early
   in the first trimester of pregnancy. The aim of this review was to
   assess the psychological sequelae and emotional distress following
   medical and surgical abortion at 10-13 weeks gestation.
   Methods Partially randomized patient preference trial in a Scottish
   Teaching Hospital was conducted. The hospital anxiety and depression
   scales were used to assess emotional distress. Anxiety levels were also
   assessed using visual analog scales while semantic differential rating
   scales were used to measure self-esteem. A total of 368 women were
   randomized, while 77 entered the preference cohort.
   Results There were no significant differences in hospital anxiety and
   depression scales scores for anxiety or depression between the groups.
   Visual analog scales showed higher anxiety levels in women randomized to
   surgery prior to abortion (P < 0.0001), while women randomized to
   surgical treatment were less anxious after abortion (P < 0.0001).
   Semantic differential rating scores showed a fall in self-esteem in the
   randomized medical group compared to those undergoing surgery (P =
   0.02).
   Conclusions Medical abortion at 10-13 weeks is effective and does not
   increase psychological morbidity compared to surgical vacuum aspiration
   and hence should be made available to all women undergoing abortion at
   these gestations.}},

Abstract = {{We suggest that a simple, rapid screening tool - the waist-to-height
   ratio (WHTR) - could help to overcome debates about the use of different
   body mass index (BMI) boundary values for assessing health risks in
   different populations. There are six reasons for our proposal:
   1. WHTR is more sensitive than BMI as an early warning of health risks.
   2. WHTR is cheaper and easier to measure and calculate than BMI.
   3. A boundary value of WHTR = 0.5 indicates increased risk for men and
   women.
   4. A boundary value of WHTR = 0.5 indicates increased risk for people in
   different ethnic groups.
   5. WHTR boundary values can be converted into a consumer-friendly chart.
   6. WHTR may allow the same boundary values for children and adults.
   Communicating messages about health risk could be much simpler if the
   same anthropometric index and the same public health message can be used
   throughout childhood, into adult life, and throughout the world. This
   simple message is: Keep your waist circumference to less than half your

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Distance-dependent weighted averaging (DDWA) is a process that is
   fundamental to most of the objective analysis schemes that are used in
   meteorology. Despite its ubiquity, aspects of its effects are still
   poorly understood. This is especially true for the most typical
   situation of observations that are discrete, bounded, and irregularly
   distributed.
   To facilitate understanding of the effects of DDWA schemes, a framework
   that enables the determination of response functions for arbitrary
   weight functions and data distributions is developed. An essential
   element of this approach is the equivalent analysis, which is a
   hypothetical analysis that is produced by using, throughout the analysis
   domain, the same weight function and data distribution that apply at the
   point where the response function is desired. This artifice enables the
   derivation of the response function by way of the convolution theorem.
   Although this approach requires a bit more effort than an alternative
   one, the reward is additional insight into the impacts of DDWA analyses.
   An important insight gained through this approach is the exact nature of
   the DDWA response function. For DDWA schemes the response function is
   the complex conjugate of the normalized Fourier transform of the
   effective weight function. In facilitating this result, this approach
   affords a better understanding of which elements (weight functions, data
   distributions, normalization factors, etc.) affect response functions
   and how they interact to do so.
   Tests of the response function for continuous, bounded data and
   discrete, irregularly distributed data verify the validity of the
   response functions obtained herein. They also reinforce previous
   findings regarding the dependence of response functions on analysis
   location and the impacts of data boundaries and irregular data spacing.
   Interpretation of the response function in terms of amplitude and phase
   modulations is illustrated using examples. Inclusion of phase shift
   information is important in the evaluation of DDWA schemes when they are
   applied to situations that may produce significant phase shifts. These
   situations include those where data boundaries influence the analysis
   value and where data are irregularly distributed. By illustrating the
   attendant movement, or shift, of data, phase shift information also
   provides an elegant interpretation of extrapolation.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining adequate features is a critical step in classifying causable
   patterns in control charts. Various methods were developed to extract
   features that maximize the inter-class variability while minimizing the
   intra-class variations. Most of these methods are based on either time
   or frequency domain analysis. As a multi-resolution analysis approach,
   wavelet transform was considered to exploit the joint time-frequency
   characteristics of the patterns. However, the effectiveness of the
   features obtained by multi-resolution wavelet analysis (MRWA) suffers
   from the frequency leakage among the different spectral bands. This
   phenomenon is inherent in wavelet analysis regardless of the choice of
   the mother wavelet. Cross-band frequency leakage smears the
   band-specific information, which may yield less distinguishing features,
   especially for short-time observation patterns.
   In this work we introduce a multi-resolution analysis approach based on
   discrete cosine transform (DCT) that overcomes the problems associated
   with MRWA. We also verify that the classification rates of shift, trend,
   and cyclic causable patterns using multi-resolution DCT (MRDCT) features
   are higher than those obtained using MRWA features. Furthermore, the
   computational requirements for MRDCT are notably less than those needed
   for MRWA. Artificial neural network (ANN) classifier was used with both
   feature extraction methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Study objectives: Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is an invasive procedure
   associated with patient discomfort and frequent nose pain. A simple
   sedation procedure that does not require the intervention of an
   anesthetist is of interest. The aim of this prospective, randomized,
   double-blind study was to assess efficiency of nitrous oxide inhalation
   on the reduction of FB-induced discomfort in adult patients.
   Design and settings: Two hundred six patients were randomized to receive
   either a prefixed equimolar nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture (N2O) or a
   prefixed equimolar nitrogen and oxygen mixture (control). The primary
   outcome was stress as assessed by pulse rate and systemic BP during the
   procedure. Secondary outcomes were self-assessed pain using a visual
   analog scale (VAS) and patient satisfaction based on a questionnaire.
   Adverse events were recorded.
   Results: A significant increase in BP was observed only in the control
   group (p = 0.003), while pulse rate values did not differ between the
   two groups. As assessed by the VAS, pain was lower in the N2O group as
   compared to placebo (p = 0.02). Nose pain and cough were also
   significantly reduced by N2O. Adverse events, mostly anxiety, were
   reported in 10 patients.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that equimolar N2O inhalation is
   efficient in reducing patient discomfort and may be an alternative to
   general anesthesia.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed radar and damage survey analyses of a severe bow echo event
   that occurred on 10 June 2003 during the Bow Echo and Mesoscale
   Convective Vortex (MCV) Experiment are presented. A bow echo formed just
   east of Saint Louis, Missouri, and produced a continuous straight-line
   wind damage swath approximately 8 km in width and 50 km in length along
   with five F0-F1 tornadoes. Careful superposition of the damage survey
   analysis and Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) data from
   Saint Charles, Missouri (KLSX), showed that the primary straight-line
   wind damage swath was not collocated with the bow echo apex as has been
   suggested in previous studies. Rather, the primary damage swath was
   found north of the bow apex, collocated with a low-level vortex that
   formed on the leading edge of the bow echo. Much of the primary damage
   swath appeared to have been created by the low-level vortex. Moreover,
   most of the surface straight-line wind damage was generated during the
   early stages of bow echo morphology prior to when the radar-detected bow
   echo attributes were best defined.
   Detailed analysis of the KLSX radar data revealed the genesis of 11
   low-level meso-gamma-scale vortices within the convective system.
   Superposition of the damage survey data showed that five of the vortices
   were tornadic. Careful analysis of the radar data suggests that it may
   be possible to distinguish between the tornadic and nontornadic
   vortices. Consistently, the tornadic vortices were longer-lived and
   stronger at low levels {[}0-3 km above ground level (AGL)] and rapidly
   deepened and intensified just prior to tornadogenesis. Similar evolution
   was not observed with the nontornadic vortices. All of the tornadic
   vortices formed coincident with or after the genesis time of the
   rear-inflow jet. These results suggest that the rear-inflow jet may be
   important for creating tornadic vortices within bow echoes. The
   detection and warning implications of these results are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Introduced avian pox virus and malaria have had devastating impacts on
   native Hawaiian forest birds, yet little has been published about their
   prevalence and distribution in forest bird communities outside of
   windward Hawaii Island. We surveyed native and non-native forest birds
   for these two diseases at three different elevations on leeward Mauna
   Loa Volcano at the Kona Forest Unit of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife
   Refuge. Prevalence of malaria by both serology and microscopy varied by
   elevation and ranged from 28\% at 710 m to 13\% at 1830 m. Prevalence of
   pox-like lesions also varied by altitude, ranging in native species from
   10\% at 710 in to 2\% at 1830 m. Native species at all elevations had
   the highest prevalence of malaria] antibody and pox-like lesions. By
   contrast, pox-like lesions were not detected in individuals of four
   non-native species and only 5\% of Japanese White-eye (Zosterops
   japonicus) was positive for malaria. A significantly high proportion of
   birds with pox-like lesions also had serological evidence of concurrent,
   chronic malarial infections, suggesting an interaction between these
   diseases, dual transmission of both diseases by the primary mosquito
   vector (Culex quinquefasciatus) or complete recovery of some
   pox-infected birds without loss of toes. Results from this study
   document high prevalence of malaria and pox at this refuge. Development
   of effective disease control strategies will be important for
   restoration of remnant populations of the endangered `Akiapola' au
   (Hemignathas munroi), Hawaii Creeper (Oreomystis mana), and Hawaii
   `Akepa (Loxops coccineus coccineus) that still occur on the refuge.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is required for murine
   adipocyte differentiation. However, a recent report concluded that PI3K
   was not involved in the differentiation of human preadipocytes into
   adipocytes. We have re-examined the role of PI3K in human preadipocyte
   differentiation, enrolling more patients and using more adipogenic
   indices.
   METHODS: Human preadipocytes, isolated from nine patients, were induced
   to differentiate in the presence or absence of 100 nM wortmannin. After
   12-15 days, triacylglycerol accumulation and the expression of
   adipogenic markers ( fatty acid synthase and adiponectin) were measured.
   RESULTS: A significant inhibition in triacylglycerol accumulation and in
   the induction of fatty acid synthase protein expression was observed,
   but there was no effect on adiponectin protein expression.
   CONCLUSION: Inhibition of PI3K reduces the differentiation of human
   preadipocytes into adipocytes, suggesting a role for this enzyme in the
   human adipogenic process.}},

   Standard H\&E and iNOS staining was performed on colonic sections.
   Altered stool consistency was found from day 1 to day 21 PI;
   leukocytosis peaked on days 6-21 PI. Edema and cell infiltration were
   found in mucosa and submucosa (days 2-14 PI). Contractility displayed a
   disorganized pattern with decreased high-amplitude, low-frequency (HALF)
   contractions. A progressive fading of spontaneous activity was observed
   and was partly restored in strips devoid of submucosa. iNOS
   immunoreactivity increased in epithelial and infiltrating cells (days
   2-14 PI). In this model of colonic inflammation, the decrease in
   spontaneous contractility, which might be caused by NO generated from

   Several different preparations are available including interferon beta

   have been concerns relating to liver(1) and now kidney toxicity. Case
   Report: We present a case of a 28-yr old male who developed a severe
   case of nephrotic syndrome while being treated for relapsing/remitting
   Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) with weekly injections of interferon beta 1.
   Subsequent course: The nephrosis resolved almost completely once the
   interferon was stopped and after immunosuppressive treatment. At its
   peak the daily protein loss was 35.82 g. Kidney biopsy demonstrated
   membranous glomerulonephritis. Discussion: Two other case reports of
   nephrotic syndrome have been reported in the literature. This latest
   (third) report suggests that the safety profile should be reexamined and
   at least raises the question of potential renal toxicity of interferons

Abstract = {{In this paper, a kinetic study of the devolatilization of tire rubber
   has been performed in a thermobalance using nitrogen as carrier gas. The
   main operation variables have been studied including flow rate, particle
   size, final temperature and heating rate, observing that only
   temperature has a remarkable effect on tire rubber conversion. Kinetic
   parameters have been calculated and used to simulate all experimental
   curves including the ones obtained at different heating rates. In
   addition, an approximate tire rubber composition has been obtained by
   integrating the reaction rate versus temperature curves. The suitability
   of the kinetic parameters has been demonstrated in real conditions by
   performing experiments in a fixed bed reactor. Finally, the conclusions
   achieved from this study can be used not only for pyrolysis process
   design but also for the interpretation and modeling of the tire rubber
   combustion process. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The reactivity of a synthetic diamond powder with NO2 was investigated
   at 313 and 373 K using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier
   transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and an environmental cell. The reaction
   is non-catalytic and produces adsorbed RNOx and ROx species on the
   surface and NO in the gas-phase by dissociative chemisorption. Infrared
   studies of the adsorbed products have allowed us to identify the
   presence of nitroalkyl, alkylnitrite, alkylnitrate, carboxyles and
   anhydrides as the major surface species. The influence of the reaction
   temperature in terms of kinetics and nature of adsorbed intermediates is
   also discussed, just as the thermal stability of the adsorbed products.

Abstract = {{The exact law of mortality dynamics in changing populations and
   environment is derived. It includes no explicit characteristics of
   animal-environment interactions (metabolism, etc.) which are a must for
   life; it is universal for all animals, from single-cell yeast to humans,
   with their drastically different biology, evolutionary history, and
   complexity; it is rapidly (within few percent of life span) reversible.
   Such a law is unique for live systems with their homeostatic
   self-adjustment to environment (cf. thermodynamics of liquids and
   glasses). The law which is valid for all live, and only live, systems is
   their specific natural law. Mortality is an instrument of natural
   selection and biological diversity. Its law, which is preserved in
   evolution of all species, is a conservation law of mortality, selection,
   evolution, biology. The law implies new kinds of intrinsic mortality and
   adaptation which dominate in evolutionary unprecedented protected
   populations and, in contrast to species-specific natural selection,
   proceed via universal stepwise rungs and reduce to universal cellular
   mechanism. The law demonstrates that intrinsic mortality and at least
   certain aspects of aging are disposable evolutionary byproducts, and
   directed genetic and/or biological changes may yield healthy and vital
   Methuselah lifespan. This is consistent with experiments. Universality
   implies that single-cell yeast may provide a master key to the cellular
   mechanism of universal mortality, aging, selection, evolution, and its
   regulation in all animals. One may look for its manifestations in animal
   cells also, e.g., in their replicative senescence and cancer.
   Evolutionary origin and genetic nature of universality are suggested.

Title = {{Chronic ethanol feeding controls the activities of various sialidases by
   regulating their relative synthetic rates in the rat liver}},
Journal = {{METABOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1056-1064}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We have determined the concentration effects of feeding for 8 weeks
   10.8\%, 21.6\%, and 36\% dietary ethanol calories on the activities and
   relative synthetic rates (RSRs) of various subcellular sialidases of rat
   liver. The hepatic RSRs of each species of sialidase was determined
   based on the ratio of 1-hour incorporation of {[}S-35]-methionine into
   immunoprecipitable sialidase as percent of the incorporation into total
   protein in each subcellular fraction. Ganglioside sialidase activities
   in the hepatic subcellular fractions were also determined. Ethanol
   feeding at 36\% dietary calories caused an increase in the ganglioside
   sialidase activity of the plasma membrane sialidase (PMS) by 232\%
   (P<.01) and that of cytosolic sialidase (CS) by 184\% (P<.05), but
   decreased the lysosomal membrane sialidase (LMS) by 54\% (P<.01) when
   compared with the control animals. The specificity of each antisialidase
   antibody was verified by immunoblots. The RSR of PMS was increased by
   40\% (P<.01), 67\% (P<.01), and 220\% (P<.01) in the 10.8\%, 21.6\%, and
   36\% ethanol groups, respectively. Similarly, the RSR of CS was
   increased by 17\% (P<.01), 19\% (P<.01), and 63\% (P<.01), respectively,
   in these ethanol groups. In contrast, the RSR of LMS was inhibited by
   36\% (P<.01), 34\% (P<.01), and 69\% (P<.01), respectively, in these
   ethanol groups. Intralysosomal sialidase failed to hydrolyze
   gangliosides. Thus, PMS and CS, but not LMS or intralysosomal sialidase,
   may play important roles in ethanol-modulated desialylation of
   gangliosides and consequent liver injury and behavioral alterations. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, the results from an experimental campaign about the
   flashing process occurring through a metering manual expansion valve,
   are presented and discussed. The results involved the measurement at
   different lifts of the flow-rate flowing through the valve for three
   different refrigerants R22, R290 (propane) and R410A. First the
   experimental rig is described and the employed instrumentation is
   commented upon and the corresponding uncertainties analyzed. The test
   matrix is then presented and discussed. Then the geometry of the valve
   is described and an analysis about its geometric throat area as a
   function of the valve lift is also presented. The results of mass flow
   rate for different upstream pressure and temperature, subcooling, and
   downstream pressure are presented and the effect of each of those
   operating condition on the obtained mass flow rate is discussed.
   Different flow models are applied in order to evaluate the effective
   flow area of the valve at every valve lift and a comparison study is
   performed in order to elucidate which is the model which better explains
   the obtained results. Finally the results obtained with the best
   estimate model are shown for the full collection of tested points and
   the three tested refrigerants. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{For the Arctic ice layer with high temperature in summer, the concepts
   of enthalpy degree, specific enthalpy and enthalpy conduction
   coefficient etc. are introduced in terms of the concept of enthalpy in

   process of phase transformation of the Arctic ice. The condition of
   determinant solution and the identification model of diffusion
   coefficient of enthalpy are presented. Half implicit difference scheme
   and Schwartz alternating direction iteration are applied to solve the
   enthalpy conduction equation and sensitivity equation. Furthermore the
   Newton-Raphson algorithm is used for identification. The numerical
   results illustrate that the mathematic model and optimization algorithm
   are precise and feasible by the data (2003.8) of the Second Chinese

Abstract = {{The effect of the brassinosteroid (BR) 24-epibrassinolide (epiBL;
   10(-13) -10(-6) M) on growth and levels of chlorophylls, carotenoids,
   sugars and protein in Wolffia arrhiza after 7 days of cultivation is
   reported. Application of epiBL to W. arrhiza cultures stimulates the
   growth and increases the content of photosynthetic pigments, sugar and
   protein. The greatest effect of epiBL is observed at a concentration of
   10(-9) M. We tested the action of Brz2001, a specific BR biosynthesis
   inhibitor, in the range of 10(-6)-10(-4) M. Addition of Brz2001 to W.
   arrhiza cultures inhibits their growth after 7 days of cultivation. The
   inhibition of growth could be reversed by the addition of epiBL.
   Moreover, there was not complete recovery to the level of control,
   especially at 5 x 10(-5)-10(-4) M Brz2001. The effects of treatment with
   10-9 M epiBL mixed with a mevalonate pathway inhibitor (mevinolin), or a
   2-methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway inhibitor (clomazone), were also
   investigated. Mevinolin did not inhibit growth of W. arrhiza after 7
   days of cultivation. However, clomazone did. Addition of epiBL overcame
   this inhibition. These results suggest that the mevalonate pathway may
   not function well in W. arrhiza and that biosynthesis of BRs through the
   non-mevalonate pathway in W. arrhiza could be possible. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{To examine the similarities and differences in cognitive function

   with parkinsonism we compared the profiles of cognitive performance in
   39 patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy ( PSP), 26 patients with
   Multiple System Atrophy ( MSA) and 25 with Corticobasal Degeneration (
   CBD) with those of 30 patients with classic cortical dementia,
   Alzheimer's Disease ( AD), using two different cognitive screening
   tests: Dementia Rating Scale ( DRS) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive
   Examination ( ACE). The cognitive profile on ACE and DRS subtests
   distinguished subcortical diseases from each other as well as from AD.
   All parkinsonian syndromes were characterized by a disproportionate
   impairment in verbal fluency, particularly letter fluency. The three
   diseases differed, however, in the degree of language, memory and
   visuospatial impairment. We conclude that similarities, as well as
   differences, between PSP, MSA and CBD can be detected using a brief,
   clinically applicable cognitive screening test. The pattern of cognitive
   impairment is likely to reflect a different distribution of pathology,
   in particular a higher degree of cortical involvement in PSP and CBD.}},

Journal = {{PLANT AND SOIL}},

Volume = {{275}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{111-122}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Ca- and Fe-rich seepage in wet dune slacks often sustains oligotrophic,
   species rich vegetation as a result of reduced P availability. While
   this effect has been attributed to pH buffering, we tested whether Ca-
   and Fe-rich seepage also immobilised P in calcareous soils with a strong
   pH buffer. Two oligotrophic species (Carex flacca and Schoenus
   nigricans) and two eutrophic species (Calamagrostis epigejos and Molinia
   caerulea) were planted in experimental sods. After 4 months supply with
   water of seepage or infiltration quality, with or without the addition
   of P, soil P fractions and a number of plant physiological responses
   were measured. A field validation was performed in a flow-through lake
   in calcareous dunes where the seepage flow had been restored recently.
   The readily available water soluble P fraction (Pw) was reduced by more
   than 80\% by seepage, both in the greenhouse experiment and in the
   field, but the P Olsen-inorganic fraction was unaffected. All four test
   species had elevated N: P ratios in aboveground tissues when treated
   with seepage, indicating that seepage water had indeed reduced P
   availability to plants. Formation of dauciform roots by Carex flacca was
   diminished by P addition to less than 25\% of treatments without P
   addition, indicating sensitivity to P availability, while seepage on
   average halved production of these root structures. Dauciform root
   formation by Schoenus nigricans was unaffected by the P addition and the
   hydrological treatment. Biomass of the test species in the experiment as
   well as vegetation biomass and relative abundance of oligotrophic
   species in the field were unrelated to seepage patterns, suggesting that
   compensatory mechanisms enabled the plants to sustain biomass production
   within the time frame of this experiment. In conclusion, Ca- and Fe-rich
   seepage can lower P availability in soils with a strong pH buffer. In
   the long term, this may create favourable conditions for species that
   have low P requirements or efficient P uptake. In the short term,
   however, existing vegetation seems to be resilient to changes in P
   supply.}},

   effects of systemic immunosuppressant drugs prompted us to evaluate the
   efficacy of topical tacrolimus for treatment of CAD. Patient and
   treatment: A 58-year-old man with CAD, resistant to previous treatment
   with topical and systemic corticosteroids, oral cyclosporine and
   PUVA-photochemotherapy, was treated with tacrolimus ointment 0.1\% once
   a day. Results: Tacrolimus ointment led to significant improvement of
   pruritus and severe eczematous skin lesions after 20 days of treatment.
   Conclusions: Tacrolimus shows a beneficial effect on CAD; this could be
   attributed to the fact that CAD is characterized by a lymphohistiocytic
   infiltrate producing a chronic eczema and that tacrolimus blocks the
   activation of lymphocytes and other immune system cells, also inhibiting
   the release of mediators from cutaneous mast cells and basophils.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims at investigations of the low EEL region in the wide
   band gap system diamond. The advent of the UHV Enfina electron energy
   loss spectrometer combined with Digital Micrograph acquisition and
   processing software has made reliable detection of absorption losses
   below 10eV possible. Incorporated into a dedicated STEM this
   instrumentation allows the acquisition of spectral information via
   spectrum maps (spectrum imaging) of sample areas hundreds of nanometers
   across, with nanometers pixel sizes, adequate spectrum statistics and
   0.3 eV energy resolution, in direct correlation with microstructural
   features in the mapping area. We aim at discerning defect related losses
   at band gap energies, and discuss different routes to simultaneously
   process and analyse the spectra in a map. This involves extracting the
   zero loss peak from each spectrum and constructing ratio maps from the
   intensities in two energy windows, one defect related and one at a
   higher, crystal bandstructure dominated energy. This was applied to the
   residual spectrum maps and their first derivatives. Secondly, guided by
   theoretical EEL spectra calculations, the low loss spectra were fitted
   by a series of gaussian distributions. Pixel maps were constructed from
   amplitude ratios of gaussians, situated in the defect and the unaffected
   energy regime. The results demonstrate the existence of sp(2) -bonded
   carbon in the vicinity of stacking faults and partial dislocations in
   CVD diamond as well as additional states below conduction band, tailing
   deep into the band gap, at a node in a perfect dislocation. Calculated
   EEL spectra of shuffle dislocations give similar absorption features at
   5-SeV, and it is thought that this common feature is due to sp(2) -type
   bonding. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plant, and particularly cereal genomes, are challenging to sequence due
   to their large size and high repetitive DNA content. Gene-enrichment
   strategies are alternative or complementary approaches to complete
   genome sequencing that yield, rapidly and inexpensively, useful sequence
   data from large and complex genomes. The maize genome is large (2.7 Gbp)
   and contains large amounts of conserved repetitive elements.
   Furthermore, the high allelic diversity found between maize inbred lines
   may necessitate sequencing several inbred lines in order to recover the
   maize ``gene pool{''}. Two gene-enrichment approaches, methylation
   filtration (MF) and high C(o)t(HC) sequencing have been tested in maize
   and their ability to sample the gene space has been examined. Combined
   with other genomic sequencing strategies, gene-enriched genomic
   sequencing is a practical way to examine the maize gene pool, to order
   and orient the genic sequences on the genome, and to enable
   investigation of gene content of other complex plant genomes.}},

Abstract = {{Fish oil-enriched diets increase n-3 FA in tissue phospholipids;
   however, a similar effect by plant-derived n-3 FA is poorly defined. To
   address this question, we determined mass changes in phospholipid FA,
   individual phospholipid classes, and cholesterol in the liver, heart,
   and brain of rats fed diets enriched in flax oil (rich in 18:3n-3), fish
   oil (rich in 22:6n-3 and 20:5n-3), or safflower oil (rich in 18:2n-6)
   for 8 wk. In the heart and liver phospholipids, 22:6n-3 levels increased
   only in the fish oil group, although rats fed flax oil accumulated
   20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3. However, in the brain, the flax and fish oil diets
   increased the phospholipid 22:6n-3 mass. In all tissues, these diets
   decreased the 20:4n-6 mass, although the effect was more marked in the
   fish oil than in the flax oil group. Although these data do not provide
   direct evidence for 18:3n-3 elongation and desaturation by the brain,
   they demonstrate that 18:3n-3-enriched diets reduced tissue 20:4n-6
   levels and increased cellular n-3 levels in a tissuedependent manner. We
   hypothesize, based on the lack of increased 22:6n-3 but increased
   18:3n-3 in the liver and heart, that the flax oil diet increased
   circulating 18:3n-3, thereby presenting tissue with this EFA for further

   powerful tool for the observation and engineering of nanostructures in

   strong dependance of the image formation process on the shape and the
   optical index of the nanostructure, the properties of the probe and also
   on the illumination and detection conditions of the experimental
   configuration used. In order to perform an optical measurement, an
   accurate model and an inversion procedure are necessary. This last

   metrology of nanostructures, the optical, thermal properties, or of

Journal = {{OPTICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2005}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The problem of input noise affecting the subpixel classification is
   examined in order to assess its relationship with the output noise. The
   approach followed in this study was to investigate the output noise
   level obtained with a least-squares subpixel classification algorithm
   applied to simulated spectra. The simulation of mixed pixel spectra took
   into account variable pixel composition and a selectable power of the
   superimposed noise. Noise was considered a zero-mean stochastic process
   over wavelength that was assumed to be jointly normal and uncorrelated.
   The paper outlines the structure and the mathematical properties of the
   performed unmixing simulations, and clearly shows the relationship
   between input and output noise. It is shown that a simple exponential
   law relates with substantial accuracy the standard deviation of input
   noise to that of the computed subpixel abundances for fully constrained
   unmixing. As expected, the cases of unconstrained and (abundances sum to
   one) partially constrained unmixing are controlled by a linear
   relationship between input and output noise amplitude. The paper also
   shows the dependence of unmixed abundances and output noise on the
   spectral similarity of end members involved in the unmixing. Three
   subpixel classification approaches (unconstrained, partially
   constrained, and fully constrained algorithms) were investigated. (c)

Abstract = {{Prefractionations of proteins prior to their proteolysis,
   chromatography, and MS/MS analyses help reduce complexity and increase
   the yield of protein identifications. A number of methods were evaluated
   here for prefractionating serum samples distributed to the participating
   laboratories as part of the human Plasma Proteome Project. These methods
   include strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography, slicing of SDS-PAGE
   gel bands, and liquid-phase IEF of the proteins. The fractionated
   proteins were trypsinized and the resulting peptides were resolved and
   analyzed by multidimensional protein identification technology coupled
   to IT MS/MS. The MS/MS spectra were clustered, combined, and searched
   against the IPI protein databank using Pep-Miner. The identification
   results were evaluated for the efficacy of the different
   prefractionation methodologies to identify larger numbers of proteins at
   higher confidence and to achieve the best coverage of the proteins with
   the identified peptides. Prefractionation based on SCX resulted in the
   largest number of identified proteins, followed by gel slices and then
   the liquid-phase IEF. An important observation was that each of the
   methods revealed a set of unique proteins, some identified with high
   confidence. Therefore, for comprehensive identification of the serum
   proteins, several different prefiractionation approaches should be used
   in parallel.}},

Abstract = {{Linear alpha(2)Omega-dynamo waves are investigated in a thin turbulent,
   differentially rotating convective stellar shell. A simplified
   one-dimensional model is considered and an asymptotic solution
   constructed based on the small aspect ratio of the shell. In a previous
   paper Griffiths et al. ( Griffiths, G. L., Bassom, A. P., Soward, A. M.
   and Kuzanyan, K. M., Nonlinear alpha(2)Omega-dynamo waves in stellar
   shells, Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid Dynam., 2001, 94, 85-133) considered
   the modulation of dynamo waves, linked to a latitudinal-dependent local
   alpha-effect and radial gradient of the zonal shear flow. These effects
   are measured at latitude theta by the magnetic Reynolds numbers
   R(alpha)f(theta) and R(Omega)g(theta). The modulated Parker wave, which
   propagates towards the equator, is localised at some mid-latitude
   theta(p) under a Gaussian envelope. In this article, we include the
   influence of a latitudinal-dependent zonal flow possessing angular
   velocity Omega({*})(theta) and consider the possibility of
   non-axisymmetric dynamo waves with azimuthal wave number m. We find that
   the critical dynamo number D-c = R alpha R Omega is minimised by
   axisymmetric modes in the alpha Omega-limit (R-alpha -> 0). On the other
   hand, when R-alpha not equal 0 there may exist a band of wave numbers 0
   < m < m(dagger) for which the non-axisymmetric modes have a smaller D-c
   than in the axisymmetric case. Here my is regarded as a continuous
   function of R-alpha with the property m(dagger) -> 0 as R-alpha -> 0 and
   the band is only non-empty when m dagger > 1, which happens for
   sufficiently large R-alpha. The preference for non-axisymmetric modes is
   possible because the wind-up of the non-axisymmetric structures can be
   compensated by phase mixing inherent to the alpha(2)Omega-dynamo. For
   parameter values resembling solar conditions, the Parker wave of maximum
   dynamo activity at latitude Omega(p) not only propagates equatorwards
   but also westwards relative to the local angular velocity
   Omega({*})(theta(p)). Since the critical dynamo number D-c = R alpha R
   Omega is O(1) for small R-alpha, the condition m(dagger) > 1 for
   non-axisymmetric mode preference imposes an upper limit on the size of
   vertical bar d Omega({*})/d theta vertical bar.}},

Abstract = {{In an earlier study of the coupling reactions of
   Ti(C5H5)(6,6-dmch)(PMe3) (dmch = dimethylcyclohexadienyl) with ketones,
   the initially formed metal complex could not be isolated, but after
   hydrolysis an unprecedented 1,4-dicoupling product was isolated. To gain
   further insight into the origin of this regiochemistry, the reaction of
   a zirconium analogue, Zr(C5H5)(6,6-dmch)(PMe3)(2), with acetone was
   investigated. A solid dimeric product could be isolated and structurally
   characterized, which revealed that both acetones had coupled, with the
   unusual 1,4-regiochemistry. This then necessitated the proposal of a new
   mechanism for these reactions, in which an alkoxide ligand, generated
   from a coupling of the initially incorporated ketone, serves as a formal
   five-electron donor, thereby altering the mode of coordination of the
   diene fragment. This proposal has been supported by the characterization
   of a mono(benzophenone) coupling product of Ti(C5H5)(6,6-dmch)(PMe3).
   This coupling product possessed both a large Ti-O-C angle, indicative of
   at least a partial contribution of a resonance form in which the
   alkoxide ligand serves as a five-electron donor, and the expected
   eta(2)-diene coordination.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{The paper provides a synthesis of work by the writers that has the
   objective of developing a new working stress method for the calculation
   of reinforcement loads in geosynthetic reinforced soil walls. As a
   precursor to this objective, careful back-analyses of a database of
   instrumented and monitored full-scale field and laboratory walls are
   used to demonstrate that the current American Association of State
   Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Simplified Method used in
   North America results in excessively conservative estimates of the
   volume of reinforcement required to generate satisfactory long-term wall
   performance. The new design method captures the essential contributions
   of the different wall components and properties to reinforcement loads.
   The method is calibrated against measured in situ wall reinforcement
   loads using a careful interpretation of reinforcement strains and the
   conversion of strain to load using a suitably selected reinforcement
   stiffness value. A novel feature of the method is to design the wall
   reinforcement so that the soil within the wall backfill is prevented
   from reaching a failure limit state, consistent with the notion of
   working stress conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We carried out gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear
   cells ( PBMCs) in 29 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) and
   21 control subjects using Affymetrix U95Av2 arrays. Using cluster
   analysis, we observed a significant alteration in the expression pattern
   of 81 genes ( P < 0.001) in the PBMCs of RA patients compared with
   controls. Many of these genes correlated with differences in monocyte
   counts between the two study populations, and we show that a large
   fraction of these genes are specifically expressed at high levels in
   monocytes. In addition, a logistic regression analysis was performed to
   identify genes that performed best in the categorization of RA and
   control samples. Glutaminyl cyclase, IL1RA, S100A12 ( also known as
   calgranulin or EN-RAGE) and Grb2-associated binding protein ( GAB2) were
   among the top discriminators. Along with previous data, the
   overexpression of S100A12 in RA patients emphasizes the likely
   importance of RAGE pathways in disease pathogenesis. The altered
   expression of GAB2, an intracellular adaptor molecule involved in
   regulating phosphatase function, is of particular interest given the
   recent identification of the intracellular phosphatase PTPN22 as a risk
   gene for RA. These data suggest that a detailed study of gene expression
   patterns in peripheral blood can provide insight into disease
   pathogenesis. However, it is also clear that substantially larger sample
   sizes will be required in order to evaluate fully gene expression
   profiling as a means of identifying disease subsets, or defining
   biomarkers of outcome and response to therapy in RA.}},

Abstract = {{5S rDNA clones from 12 South American diploid Hordeum species containing
   the HH genome and 3 Eurasian diploid Hordeum species containing the II
   genome, including the cultivated barley Hordeum vulgare, were sequenced
   and their sequence diversity was analyzed. The 374 sequenced clones were
   assigned to ``unit classes{''}, which were further assigned to haplomes.
   Each haplome contained 2 unit classes. The naming of the unit classes
   reflected the haplomes, viz. both the long H1 and short I1 unit classes
   were identified with II genome diploids, and both the long H2 and long
   Y2 unit classes were recognized in South American HH genome diploids.
   Based upon an alignment of all sequences or alignments of representative
   sequences, we tested several evolutionary models, and then subjected the
   parameters of the models to a series of maximum likelihood (ML) analyses
   and various tests, including the molecular clock, and to a Bayesian
   evolutionary inference analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
   The best fitting model of nucleotide substitution was the HKY+G
   (Hasegawa, Kishino, Yano 1985 model with the Gamma distribution rates of
   nucleotide substitutions). Results from both ML and MCMC imply that the
   long H1 and short I unit classes found in the II genome diploids
   diverged from each other at the same rate as the long H2 and long Y2
   unit classes found in the HH genome diploids. The divergence among the
   unit classes, estimated to be circa 7 million years, suggests that the
   genus Hordeum may be a paleopolyploid.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We examined whether supplementation with vitamin A and/or
   vitamins B, C, and E to HIV-infected women during pregnancy and
   lactation is related to increased concentrations of vitamins A, B12, and
   E in their infants during the first 6 months of life.
   Design: We carried out a randomized clinical trial among 716 mother -
   infant pairs in Dar-es- Salaam, Tanzania. Women were randomly allocated
   to receive a daily oral dose of one of four regimens: vitamin A,
   multivitamins ( B, C, and E), multivitamins including A, or placebo.
   Supplementation started at first prenatal visit and continued after
   delivery throughout the breastfeeding period. The serum concentration of
   vitamins A, E and B12 was measured in infants at 6 weeks and 6 months
   postpartum.
   Results: Maternal vitamin A supplementation increased serum retinol in
   the infants at 6 weeks ( mean difference = 0.09 mu mol/l, P<0.0001) and
   6 months ( mean difference = 0.06 mu mol/l, P = 0.0002), and decreased
   the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, but had no impact on serum
   vitamins E or B12. Multivitamins increased serum vitamin B12 at 6 weeks
   and 6 months ( mean differences = 176 pmol/ l, P<0.0001 and 127 pmol/ l,
   P<0.0001, respectively) and vitamin E ( mean differences = 1.8 mu mol/l,
   P = 0.0008 and 1.1 mu mol/ l, P = 0.004, respectively) and decreased the
   prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency.
   Conclusions: Vitamin supplementation to HIV-1-infected women is
   effective in improving the vitamin status of infants during the first 6
   months of age.}},

Title = {{Effect of a single vs multiple bouts of exercise on glucose control in
   women with type 2 diabetes}},
Journal = {{METABOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{The Surgeon General and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have
   recommended that multiple bouts of exercise can be accumulated
   throughout the day in lieu of the more traditional single, longer bout
   of exercise. Yet, conclusive evidence does not exist suggesting these 2
   training modes provide similar health-related benefits on metabolic
   control, especially in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of
   this study was to determine if differences exist in glucose control when
   preceded by one 30-minute or three 10-minute bouts of exercise in women
   with type 2 diabetes. Nine individuals with type 2 diabetes (53 +/- 6
   years old) and 6 control women (49 +/- 4 years old) completed 3 randomly
   ordered oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). Two of the OGTTs were
   preceded the day prior by moderate exercise (similar to 60\% Of
   VO2peak), either one 30-minute or three 10-minute bouts, whereas the
   third OGTT was used as a control day with no exercise performed 3 days
   prior. Glucose and insulin were measured every 30 minutes for 4 hours
   during the OGTT. Individuals with type 2 diabetes exhibited a greater
   overall glucose response than the controls (P<.05), but the glucose
   response to the OGTT was not different between the 3 conditions within
   each group (2-hour glucose: multiple bout, 14.3 +/- 3.2 vs 5.0 +/- 1.7;
   single bout, 14.1 +/- 3.0 vs 4.7 +/- 1.5; control day, 14.6 +/- 2.7 vs
   4.9 +/- 4.9 mmol/L). Glucose area under the curve analysis resulted in
   similar findings. As expected, the group with type 2 diabetes had
   greater fasting insulin levels compared with the control group for all
   exercise conditions (multiple bout: 4.5 +/- 1.2 vs 0.3 +/- 0.2; single
   bout: 6.4 +/- 1.6 vs 0.9 +/- 0.4; control day: 5.7 +/- 1.8 vs 1.5 +/-
   0.6 pmol/L; P<.05). Exercise or no exercise did not alter the insulin
   response to the OGTT for either group. Despite a higher glucose response
   to the glucose load in T2D, an acute exercise bout (single or multiple
   bouts) did not appear to alter glucose control the following day in
   either the individuals with type 2 diabetes or the control group. (C)

Abstract = {{This article introduces a framework to help researchers understand the
   mechanisms underlying product returns. The framework draws on research
   in consumer choice, consumer memory, and attitude stability to predict
   how the process that consumers go through at a predecisional stage
   affects their postpurchase behavior. The likelihood of product returns
   is considered contingent on the amount and nature of cognitive responses
   generated during the choice process. In Study 1, the authors focus on
   the impact of the nature of cognitive responses and show that the
   generation of responses of a different nature while choosing directly
   affects the likelihood of choice reversal. The comparative versus
   noncomparative nature of thoughts generated influences their
   diagnosticity and, accordingly, their impact on product returns when
   consumers are exposed to disconfirming information. In Study 2, the
   authors draw on the inoculation theory to manipulate the number of
   prechoice thoughts. They find that when faced with disconfirming
   information favoring a new brand, inoculated consumers who are presented
   with choice alternatives sequentially are less likely to return a brand
   than consumers who are exposed solely to positive information about the
   chosen brand at a prepurchase stage.}},

Abstract = {{F-18-Galacto-RGD has been developed for PET of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin
   expression, a receptor involved in, for example, angiogenesis and
   metastasis. Our aim was to study the kinetics and biodistribution of
   F-18-Galacto-RGD in cancer patients. Methods: Nineteen patients with
   metastases of malignant melanoma (n = 7), sarcomas (n = 10), or osseous
   metastases (n = 2) were examined. After injection of 133-200 MBq
   18F-Galacto-RGD, 3 consecutive emission scans from the pelvis to the
   thorax or dynamic emission scans of the tumor over 60 min, followed by 1
   static emission scan of the body, were acquired. Time-activity curves
   and standardized uptake values (SUVs) were derived by image
   region-of-interest analysis with image-based arterial input functions.
   Compartmental modeling was used to derive the distribution volume for
   muscle tissue and tumors. Results: F-18-Galacto-RGD showed rapid blood
   clearance and primarily renal excretion. SUVs in tumors ranged from 1.2
   to 9.0. Tumor-toblood and tumor-to-muscle ratios increased over time,
   with peak ratios of 3.1 +/- 2.0 and 7.7 +/- 4.3, respectively, at 72
   min. The tumor kinetics were consistent with a 2-tissue compartment
   model with reversible specific binding. Distribution volume values were,
   on average, 4 times higher for tumor tissue (1.5 +/- 0.8) than those for
   muscle tissue (0.4 +/- 0.1). The data suggest that there was only
   minimal free and bound (specific or nonspecific) tracer in muscle
   tissue. Conclusion: F-18-Galacto-RGD demonstrates a highly favorable
   biodistribution in humans with specific receptor binding. Most
   important, this study shows that F-18-Galacto-RGD allows visualization
   of 003 expression in tumors with high contrast. Consequently, this
   tracer offers a new strategy for noninvasive monitoring of molecular
   processes and may supply helpful information for planning and
   controlling of therapeutic approaches targeting the alpha(v)beta(2)
   integrin.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To discuss the ability of pre-operative MRI to have a beneficial
   effect on surgical performance and treatment outcome in patients with
   rectal cancer.
   Methods: A description on how MRI can be used as a tool. so select
   patients for differentiated neoadjuvant treatment, how it can be used as
   an anatomical road map for the resection of locally advanced cases, and
   how it can serve as a tool. for quality assurance of both the surgical
   procedure and overall patient management. As an illustration the
   proportion of microscopically complete resections of the period
   1993-1997, when there was no routine pre-operative imaging, is compared
   to that of the period 1998-2002, when pre-operative MR imaging was
   standardized.
   Results: The proportion of R0 resections increased from 92.5 to 97\%
   (p=0.08) and the proportion of resections with a Lateral tumour free
   margin of > 1 mm increased from 84.4 to 92.1\% (p=0.03). The incomplete
   resections in the first period were mainly due to inadequate surgical
   management of unsuspected advanced or bulky tumours, whereas in the
   second period insufficient consideration was given to extensive
   neoadjuvant treatment when the tumour was close to or invading the
   mesorectal. fascia on MR.
   Conclusions: There are good indications that in our setting
   pre-operative MR imaging, along with other improvements in rectal,
   cancer management, had a beneficial effect on patient outcome. Audit and
   discussion of the incomplete resections can lead to an improved
   operative and perioperative management. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter in vertebrate and invertebrate
   nervous systems and is widely distributed in the brain of the honey bee,
   Apis mellifera. We report here the functional characterization and
   cellular localization of the putative dopamine receptor gene, Amdop3, a
   cDNA clone isolated and identified in previous studies as AmBAR3 (Apis
   mellifera Biogenic Amine Receptor 3). The Amdop3 cDNA encodes a 694
   amino acid protein, AmDOP3. Comparison of AmDOP3 to Drosophila
   melanogaster sequences indicates that it is orthologous to the D2-like
   dopamine receptor, DD2R. Using AmDOP3 receptors expressed in HEK293
   cells we show that of the endogenous biogenic amines, dopamine is the
   most potent AmDOP3 agonist, and that activation of AmDOP3 receptors
   results in down regulation of intracellular levels of cAMP, a property
   characteristic of D2-like dopamine receptors. In situ hybridization
   reveals that Amdop3 is widely expressed in the brain but shows a pattern
   of expression that differs from that of either Amdop1 or Amdop2, both of
   which encode D1-like dopamine receptors. Nonetheless, overlaps in the
   distribution of cells expressing Amdop1, Amdop2 and Amdop3 mRNAs suggest
   the likelihood of D1:D2 receptor interactions in some cells, including
   subpopulations of mushroom body neurons. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{357-370}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A theoretical quantum neural network model is proposed using a
   non-linear Schrodinger wave equation. The model proposes that there
   exists a nonlinear Schrodinger wave equation that mediates the
   collective response of a neural lattice. The model is used to explain
   eye movements when tracking moving targets. Using a recurrent quantum
   neural network(RQNN) while simulating the eye tracking model, two very
   interesting phenomena are observed. First, as eye sensor data is
   processed in a classical neural network, a wave packet is triggered in
   the quantum neural network. This wave packet moves like a particle.
   Second, when the eye tracks a fixed target, this wave packet moves not
   in a continuous but rather in a discrete mode. This result reminds one
   of the saccadic movements of the eye consisting of `jumps' and `rests'.
   However, such a saccadic movement is intertwined with smooth pursuit
   movements when the eye has to track a dynamic trajectory. In a sense,
   this is the first theoretical model explaining the experimental
   observation reported concerning eye movements in a static scene
   situation. The resulting prediction is found to be very precise and
   efficient in comparison to classical objective modeling schemes such as
   the Kalman filter.}},

Abstract = {{The Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 not only caused serious
   ecological problems in both the Ukraine and Belarus, which continue to
   the present day, but also contaminated a large part of the higher
   latitudes of the northern hemisphere. In this paper an overview is given
   of the latter problems in upland UK, where ecological problems still
   remain some 17 years after initial contamination. Following deposition
   of radiocaesium and radioiodine in May 1986, measurements of
   radioactivity in grass and soil indicated a rapidly declining problem as
   the radioiodine decayed and the radiocaesium became immobilised by
   attachment to clay particles. However, these studies, as well as the
   advice received by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, were
   based on lowland agricultural soils, with high clay and low organic
   matter contents. The behaviour of radiocaesium in upland UK turned out
   to be dominated by high and persistent levels of mobility and
   bioavailability. This resulted in the free passage of radiocaesium
   through the food chain and into sheep. Consequently the Ministry banned
   the sale and movement of sheep over large areas of upland Britain, with
   bans remaining on some farms to the present day. Present day predictions
   suggest that these bans will continue in some cases for some years to
   come. The causes of radiocaesium mobility in upland areas have
   subsequently been the subject of intense investigation centred around
   vegetation and, in particular, soil characteristics. Soil types were
   identified which were particularly vulnerable in this respect and, where
   these coincided with high levels of deposition, sheep bans tended to be
   imposed. While much of the earlier work suggested that a low clay
   content was the main reason for continuing mobility, a very high organic
   matter content is now also believed to play a major role, this being a
   characteristic of wet and acidic upland UK soils. The overall message
   from this affair is the importance of a fundamental understanding of
   biogeochemical pathways in different ecosystems when attempting to
   predict the impacts of large-scale contamination. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The aim of this finite elemental stress analysis study was to evaluate
   the effect of hybrid layer on distribution and amount of stress formed
   under occlusal loading in a premolar tooth restored with composite or
   ceramic inlay. The mandibular premolar tooth was selected as the model
   based on the anatomical measurements suggested by Wheeler. The analysis
   is performed by using a Pentium II IBM compatible computer with the SAP
   2000 structural analysis program. Four different mathematical models
   including the following structures were evaluated: 1) composite inlay,
   adhesive resin, and tooth structure; 2) composite inlay, adhesive resin,
   hybrid layer, and tooth structure; 3) ceramic inlay, adhesive resin, and
   tooth structure; 4) ceramic inlay, adhesive resin, hybrid layer, and
   tooth structure. Loading was applied from the occlusal surface of the
   restoration, and shear stresses under loading were evaluated. The
   findings were drawn by the Saplot program, and the results were analyzed
   by graphical comparison method. The output indicated that the hybrid
   layer acts as a stress absorber in models 2 and 4. The hybrid layer has
   also changed mathematical values of stress on cavity floors in both
   restoration types. Ceramic inlay collected the stress inside the body of
   the material, but the composite inlay directly transferred the stress
   through dental tissues. As a result, it was concluded that the hybrid
   layer has an effect on stress distribution under loading in a premolar
   tooth model restored with composite or ceramic inlay. (c) 2005 Wiley

Abstract = {{When a person gets a cancer diagnosis the need for medical guidance
   often appears. In Norway, one of the providers of medical guidelines is
   the Norwegian Cancer Association where oncological nurses assist people
   with a cancer diagnosis or their relatives. The nurses search through
   both national and internal guidebooks and web pages. The input to this
   process is mostly discharge letters. The whole process is time
   consuming. To serve more patients, PaSent, a web-based intelligent
   oncological nurse advisor, has been developed. Through using discharge
   letters as input to our neural network-based information retrieval
   system PaSent, we have been able to provide relevant medical information
   to the patient as well as to the health personnel themselves. The PaSent
   search method uses predefined knowledge about the context, paired with
   the vocabulary of the input document, to compute a relevance measure for
   a potential result document. The system has been validated by
   oncological. nurses and medical doctors. In the reported experiments,
   the PaSent system is able to recommend literature, in the top section of
   the search result list, that our judges also found highly relevant. (C)

Abstract = {{The impact of selected observing systems on forecast skill is explored
   using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
   40-yr reanalysis (ERA-40) system. Analyses have been produced for a
   surface-based observing system typical of the period prior to 1945/1950,
   a terrestrial-based observing system typical of the period 1950-1979 and
   a satellite-based observing system consisting of surface pressure and
   satellite observations. Global prediction experiments have been
   undertaken using these analyses as initial states, and which are
   available every 6 h, for the boreal winters of 1990/1991 and 2000/2001
   and the summer of 2000, using a more recent version of the ECMWF model.
   The results show that for 500-hPa geopotential height, as a
   representative field, the terrestrial system in the Northern Hemisphere
   extratropics is only slightly inferior to the control system, which
   makes use of all observations for the analysis, and is also more
   accurate than the satellite system. There are indications that the skill
   of the terrestrial system worsens slightly and the satellite system
   improves somewhat between 1990/1991 and 2000/2001. The forecast skill in
   the Southern Hemisphere is dominated by the satellite information and
   this dominance is larger in the latter period. The overall skill is only
   slightly worse than that of the Northern Hemisphere. In the tropics (20
   degrees S-20 degrees N), using the wind at 850 and 250 hPa as
   representative fields, the information content in the terrestrial and
   satellite systems is almost equal and complementary. The surface-based
   system has very limited skill restricted to the lower troposphere of the
   Northern Hemisphere. Predictability calculations show a potential for a
   further increase in predictive skill of 1-2 d in the extratropics of
   both hemispheres, but a potential for a major improvement of many days
   in the tropics. As well as the Eulerian perspective of predictability,
   the storm tracks have been calculated from all experiments and validated
   for the extratropics to provide a Lagrangian perspective.}},

Abstract = {{The binding properties of an artificial receptor towards a series of

   pyrene unit connected via a short spacer to a 2,2' : 6',
   2{''}-terpyridine metal ion binding site. Interaction of cations with
   the receptor was monitored by changes in absorption profile and the
   association constants calculated for 1: 1 and 1:2 cation:ligand binding
   fall within the range log beta = 3-12. The receptor is highly
   fluorescent and quenching of the emission is observed upon cation
   binding. The potassium picrate transport properties of the
   membrane-bound receptor are also described. This receptor when
   immobilised in a polymer support, which separates two aqueous solutions,
   has been shown to transport potassium ions in the dark with a flux rate
   of 1.5 x 10(8) Mol/s m(2). In contrast, when the membrane-bound receptor
   is selectively illuminated with light (lambda > 400 nm), the flux
   increases to 2.0 x 10(8) Mol/s m(2). The transport efficiency depends on
   the nature of the trap used in the receiver phase. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Transforming growth factor 13 is the prototype of a large family of
   secreted factors that regulate multiple biological processes. In the
   immune system, TGF beta acts as an anti-inflammatory and
   immunosuppressive molecule, whereas the cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 beta
   is a crucial mediator of inflammatory responses and induces
   proinflammatory genes and acute phase proteins. Here, we present
   evidence for the existence of a direct inhibitory interaction between
   the IL-1 beta and TGF beta signaling cascades that is not dependent on
   IL-1 beta-induced SMAD7 expression. IL-1 beta and its downstream
   mediator TAK1 inhibit SMAD3-mediated TGF beta target gene activation,
   whereas SMAD3 nuclear translocation and DNA binding in response to TGF
   beta are not affected. IL-1 beta transiently induces association between
   TAK1 and the MAD homology 2 domain of SMAD3, resulting in SMAD3
   phosphorylation. Furthermore, IL-1 beta alleviates the inhibitory effect
   of TGF beta on in vitro hematopoietic myeloid colony formation. In
   conclusion, our data provide evidence for the existence of a direct
   inhibitory effect of the IL-1 beta-TAK1 pathway on SMAD3-mediated TGF
   beta signaling, resulting in reduced TGF beta target gene activation and
   restored proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To evaluate effects of preoperative administration of
   carprofen on renal function and hemostasis in dogs undergoing general
   anesthesia for fracture repair.
   Animals-26 client-owned dogs.
   Procedure-Anesthesia was induced with levo-methadone, diazepam, and
   propofol and maintained by administration of isoflurane in
   oxygen-nitrous oxide. Carprofen (4 mg/kg, SC) was administered 1 hour
   before induction to 13 dogs (group 1) and after extubation to the other
   13 dogs (group 2). All dogs also received carprofen (4 mg/kg, SC, q 24
   h) for the first 4 days after surgery. Renal function (glomerular
   filtration rate {[}GFR] urinary protein-to-urinary creatinine ratio
   {[}UP:UC], and results of urinalysis and biochemical analysis of
   plasma), hemostatic variables (bleeding time, platelet aggregation,
   prothrombin time {[}PT], activated partial thromboplastin time {[}APTT],
   and platelet count), and Hct were assessed before and at various time
   points after surgery.
   Results-Analysis of results for renal function tests most of the
   hemostatic and plasma biochemical variables, and Hct did not reveal
   significant differences between treatment groups. Values for GFR, UP:UC,
   PT, APTT, and platelet aggregation were outside reference ranges in many
   dogs before surgery and during the first 6 hours after surgery. In most
   dogs, these trauma-induced pathologic changes returned to within
   reference ranges during the 4-day period after surgery.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Carprofen did not cause clinically
   relevant adverse effects in dogs anesthetized for fracture repair after
   5 days of treatment, even when it was administered before surgery or
   given to patients with trauma-induced alterations in renal function or
   hemostasis.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this overview is to highlight important steps of ovarian
   regulation during follicle development, ovulation and the life span of
   corpus luteum (CL) in ruminants. The ovarian cycle is central to
   reproductive function. It is characterized by repeating patterns of
   cellular proliferation, differentiation and transformation that
   encompass follicular development and ovulation as well as the formation,
   function and regression of the CL. In the first part, the importance and
   regulation of final follicle growth and especially of angiogenesis and
   blood flow during foil iculogenesis, dominant follicle development and
   CL formation are described. Our results underline the importance of
   growth factors especially of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) for
   development and completion of a dense network of capillaries
   (angiogenesis) during follicle growth and CL formation. In the second
   part, the regulation of CL function by endocrine/paracrine and autocrine
   acting regulators is discussed. There is evidence that besides the main
   endocrine hormones luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH)
   local regulators as growth factors, peptides, steroids and
   prostaglandins are important modulators of luteal function. During early
   CL development until midluteal stage oxytocin (OT), prostaglandins and
   progesterone (P) itself stimulate luteal cell proliferation and function
   supported by the luteotropic action of a number of growth factors. The
   still high mRNA expression, protein concentration and localization of
   VEGF, FGF and IGF family members in the cytoplasm of luteal cells during
   midluteal stage suggest that they play pivotal role in the maintenance
   (survival) of this endocrine tissue. The major function of the CL is to
   secrete P. Progesterone itself regulates the length of the estrous cycle
   via influencing the timing of the luteolytic PGF2 alpha signal from the
   endometrium. At the end of a nonfertile cycle, the regression of CL
   commences, steroidogenic capacity is lost (functional luteolysis), cell
   death is initiated, and tissue involution as well as resorption occurs
   within a few days (structural luteolysis). The cascade of mediators
   during luteolysis is very complex and still awaits elucidation. Evidence
   is given for participation of blood flow, inflammatory cytokines,
   vasoactive peptides (angiotensin II and endothelin-I), and decrease of
   the classical luteotropic mediators. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Although Behcet's disease (BD) is classified among the
   vasculitides laboratory diagnostic does not include regularly
   autoantibodies associated with vascular manifestations of systemic
   autoimmune diseases.
   Patients and methods: Twelve consecutive BD patients were studied,for
   autoantibodies associated with vascular manifestations of systemic
   autoimmune diseases, HLA frequencies, and possible neurological
   involvement using neurophysiological methods and MRI.
   Results: HLA-C{*}15 and C{*}16,frequencies were signficantly (p<0.05)
   higher in the patients compared with a reference population.
   Immunoglobulin G concentrations of antiphosphatidylserine and
   antiribosomal phosphoprotein antibodies were significantly elevated in
   BD patients when compared with healthy controls.
   Conclusions: The increased frequencies of HLA-C alleles in BD patients
   may stress the role of NK cells in the pathogenesis of this disease.
   Antiphosphatidylserine autoantibodies may in view of their role in
   apoptosis be involved in the development of vasculitis in BD. Because
   concentrations of antiphosphatidylserine and antiribosomal
   phosphoprotein antibodies were increased in BD diagnostic tools of this

Abstract = {{According to estimates of the World Health Organization more than 80 per
   cent of the world population uses traditional medicinal plants to
   provide primary health care, particularly in developing countries.
   However in such countries traditional knowledge regarding the use of
   medicinal plants has been significantly lost. Moreover the availability
   of these plants has been dramatically reduced as a result of habitat
   degradation, especially in tropical forests. Ethnobotanical research
   could contribute to avoid the loss of traditional knowledge as well as
   to protect biodiversity. The interdisciplinary nature of ethnobotany
   allows for a wide range of approaches and applications. Nevertheless,
   little interchange of theories and methods among related disciplines has
   taken place to date, resulting in the predominance of descriptive works,
   which are primarily limited to compilations of useful plants. In
   addition, very rarely the intellectual property rights of local
   communities are recognized. In order to overcome this situation, the
   current approaches of the ethnobotanical research emphasize the
   development of wide-scoped interdisciplinary projects, which begin by
   recording traditional knowledge, recognize intellectual property rights
   and culminate in establishing strategies designed to reward the
   communities for the benefits obtained during the investigation. In the
   present paper we analyze the goals and current approaches applied on
   ethnobotanical research, as well as the different stages that
   interdisciplinary research projects regarding medicinal plants should
   cover.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to identify the intra-arch occlusal
   characteristics that best discriminated 3 groups with different grades
   of dental arch discrepancies. This cross-sectional analysis was
   conducted in Lima, Peru, in 2003. Methods: Intra-arch measurements were
   made on 150 sets of dental casts of high school students (aged 12-16; 75
   boys, 75 girls). Stepwise multiple discriminant analysis (SMDA) was used
   to obtain a better understanding of the morphological relationships
   between tooth and dental-arch variables and their relationship with
   crowding. Results: Mesiodistal tooth sizes and crown proportions of some
   teeth differed among significantly crowded, mild-to-moderately crowded,
   and spaced dental arches. Buccolingual tooth sizes were similar in the 3
   groups. Of the arch dimensions evaluated, only intermolar arch width and
   arch length differed between the groups. An SMDA was developed to
   classify dental-arch discrepancies in the permanent dentition based on
   several intra-arch occlusal characteristics. The variable with the
   highest discriminatory capability between groups was arch length. When
   arch length was taken out of the SMDA, the explanatory capability from
   the variability on the dental arch discrepancies diminished from 51\% to
   14\%. When the remaining arch dimension variable (intermolar width) was
   taken out, the explanatory capability diminished more (from 14\% to
   8\%). Conclusions: Although other tooth-size and arch dimensions are
   indicators of crowding, arch length is the most important factor.}},

   the Kyrgyz Republic. The period under investigation covers the years
   1997 to 1998, for which data are available. The results point to the
   extreme vulnerability of individuals with less education and women, who
   cumulated a high risk of being unemployed, of remaining longer in
   unemployment, of being discouraged unemployed and, if employed, of being
   low-paid or working in precarious jobs. Other groups facing a high risk
   of exclusion, both from and within employment, were people with
   disabilities, individuals living in rural or depressed areas, young
   people and internal migrants. The multiple aspects of vulnerability in

   supplemented with 1\% glucose and 0.1\% yeast extract exhibited nitrile
   hydratase-amidase activity specific for saturated aliphatic nitrites or

   with nitrile hydratase-amidase that in addition to saturated aliphatic
   nitriles-amide also hydrolyzed aromatic amide. Nocardia globerula NHB-2
   cultivated on nutrient broth containing propionitrile exhibited
   nitrilase activity that hydrolyzed aromatic nitrile and unsaturated
   aliphatic nitrile. The versatility of this organism in the hydrolysis of

Abstract = {{Background: Neutrophil migration into the lung is a critical, but poorly
   understood step in the pathogenesis of post-traumatic, acute respiratory
   distress syndrome (ARDS). We investigated changes in interleukin-8
   (IL-8) mediated neutrophil migration and associated changes in receptor
   expression, of the IL-8 receptors CXCR1, the integrins CD11b/CD18 and
   platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in patients
   sustaining major trauma.
   Methods: Eleven patients with major trauma, injury severity score (ISS),
   median 22 (range 18-41), were followed prospectively. Eleven normal
   volunteers were used as controls. Blood samples were obtained within 4
   +/- 2 h of injury, at 24 h, day 3 and day 5. Neutrophils migration was
   assessed by an in vitro IL-8 assay and neutrophil surface receptor
   expression by FACS analysis.
   Results: IL-8 mediated neutrophil migration was significantly increased
   on admission following major trauma and remained elevated for 3 days
   (p<0.05). This was associated with up-regulation of CXCR1 (p<0.01) and
   down-regulation of PECAM-1 (p<0.05). CD11b and CD18 although initially
   unchanged, became down-regulated on day 3 (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: These data show that major trauma primes circulating
   neutrophils for increased migration in response to IL-8. This response
   is sustained for 72 h and is associated with changes in neutrophil
   surface receptor expression. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cajal-Retzius cells are critical in cortical lamination, but very little
   is known about their origin and development. The homeodomain
   transcription factor Dbx1 is expressed in restricted progenitor domains
   of the developing pallium: the ventral pallium (VP) and the septum.
   Using genetic tracing and ablation experiments in mice, we show that two
   subpopulations of Reelin(+) Cajal-Retzius cells are generated from
   Dbx1-expressing progenitors. VP- and septum-derived Reelin(+) neurons
   differ in their onset of appearance, migration routes, destination and
   expression of molecular markers. Together with reported data supporting
   the generation of Reelin(+) cells in the cortical hem, our results show
   that Cajal-Retzius cells are generated at least at three focal sites at
   the borders of the developing pallium and are redistributed by
   tangential migration. Our data also strongly suggest that distinct
   Cajal-Retzius subtypes exist and that their presence in different
   territories of the developing cortex might contribute to region-specific
   properties.}},

   transplantation is an important treatment option at CNS relapse of NHL

Abstract = {{A vision technique system was implemented in order to highlight the

   two types of visual information at different times throughout the ageing
   test: the partial digital images of the sample surfaces and then the
   surface relief and laser light reflection obtained by casting a sheet of
   laser light on to the material. The accuracy of the laser camera scanner
   is evaluated in the first part of this paper. The methodology was
   successfully used to identify the degradation morphologies occurring on
   five types of limestone exposed to salt spray, and to quantify the

Abstract = {{Porous reactive barriers containing metallic iron and hydrogenotrophic
   denitrifying microorganisms may potentially be suitable for in-situ
   remediation of nitrate-contaminated groundwater resources. The main
   objective of the research described here was to determine the type and
   concentration of metallic iron to be used in such reactive barriers so
   that ammonia formation through metallic iron-assisted abiotic nitrate
   reduction was minimized, while a reasonable rate of biological
   denitrification, sustained by hydrogen produced through metallic iron
   corrosion, was maintained. Initial experiments included the
   demonstration of autotrophic denitrification supported by externally
   supplied hydrogen, either from a gas cylinder or generated through
   anaerobic corrosion of metallic iron. Next, the effect of iron type on
   abiotic nitrate reduction was studied, and among those types of iron
   tested, steel wool, with its relatively low surface-area-to-weight
   ratio, was identified as the material that exhibited the least
   propensity to abiotically reduce nitrate. Further, long-term experiments
   were carried out in batch reactors to determine the effect of steel wool
   surface area on the extent of denitrification and ammonia production.
   Finally, experiments carried out in up-flow column reactors containing
   sand and varying quantities of steel wool demonstrated biological
   denitrification occurring in such systems. Based on the results of the
   final set of experiments, it appeared that to minimize ammonia
   production, the steel-wool concentration up-flow columns must be even
   below the lowest value-0.5 g steel wool added to 125 cm(3) of sand-used
   during this study. To counter any detrimental effect of lowered steel
   wool concentration on the extent of hydrogenotrophic denitrification,
   increase of the retention time in the columns to values higher than 13
   days (the maximum value investigated in this study) may be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The human organic anion transporter hOAT1 (SLC22A6) contributes to the
   uptake of a range of small organic anions across the basolateral
   membrane of the renal proximal tubule and drives their urinary
   elimination. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants of
   hOAT1 and to investigate potential effects on the functional properties
   of this transporter. Twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) in
   hOAT1 were identified in genomic DNA from 92 individuals of African,
   Asian, and Caucasian origin. Two SNPs encoded changes in amino acid
   sequence; arginine to histidine ( residue 50) and lysine to isoleucine (
   residue 525). Significantly, these SNPs were only present in the samples
   of African origin. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, wild-type
   R50-hOAT1 and the variants R50H-hOAT1 and K525I-hOAT1 all mediated the
   probenecidsensitive uptake of the classic organic anion
   para-aminohippurate (PAH). Kinetic analysis indicated that the transport
   affinity (K-m) for PAH was unchanged in the variants, compared with wild
   type. Interestingly, the K m for the nucleoside phosphonate analogs
   adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir seemed to be decreased in the
   R50H-hOAT1 variant compared with the wild type, whereas the kinetics of
   K525I-hOAT1 remained unchanged. In conclusion, this is the first study
   to identify variation of hOAT1 in a racially diverse sample and to
   investigate the functional properties of the resulting variants. Since
   hOAT1 has been suggested as the basis of nephrotoxicity induced by
   nucleoside phosphonate analogs, this study raises the intriguing
   possibility that individuals with genetic variation in hOAT1, such as
   R50H, may display different handling of these drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Since September 2000, continuous terrorist attacks have exposed Israeli
   society to trauma, and the impact of these events on the mental health
   of the elderly Israeli population remains unclear. The authors sought to
   assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress-related symptoms of
   distress, depression, optimism, self-efficacy, and sense of safety of
   the young-old and old-old Jewish population after 19 months of intense
   terrorism in Israel, in order to identify correlates of the
   psychological sequelae and compare symptoms and coping methods of these
   populations with those of younger adults. Methods: Authors did a
   telephone survey using stratified sampling with a national sample of
   young-old (65-74 years old), old-old (> 74 years old) and a comparison
   group of younger adults (18-64 years old). Results: No difference was
   found in the level of exposure, traumatic stress symptoms, including
   probable PTSD, except for a nonsignificant tendency toward more
   depersonalization and emotional numbness in the elderly group, a
   tendency toward more sleeplessness, more re-experiencing of unwanted
   thoughts, hyperarousal, fewer avoidance symptoms, and less
   disengagement-coping in the old-old group. Younger adults were found to
   be significantly more optimistic. Young-old and old-old people used
   cigarettes/alcohol and tranquilizers more often to cope with the
   situation, and old-old people who used disengagement-coping felt less
   helped by it. Conclusions: Young-old and old-old people do not differ
   significantly from the younger adult population with regard to their
   response to 19 months of intense and recurrent terrorism.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and testosterone levels
   both decline with age in healthy men. Features of the metabolic syndrome
   also show age-related deteriorations. We examined the relative
   contribution of age and declining androgen levels to features of the
   metabolic syndrome in men. In a sample of 130 nonsmoking men from the
   Quebec Family Study, we tested the hypothesis that age-related decreases
   in DHEA-S and testosterone levels would explain most of the variance in
   alterations of the metabolic profile associated with aging. As expected,
   we found that plasma DHEA-S and testosterone levels were negatively
   associated with age. Significant negative correlations were found
   between androgen levels and adiposity measures, body fat distribution,
   and metabolic risk variables. Statistical control for age eliminated
   correlations with DHEA-S, whereas age-adjusted associations between
   testosterone and most adiposity and metabolic variables remained
   significant. The percentage frequency of men characterized by 3 or more
   features of the metabolic syndrome increased with decreasing
   testosterone (8.9\%-44.2\%, chi(2)=15.89, P<.0005) and DHEA-S levels
   (8.9\%-41.5\%, chi(2)=13.02, P<.005). Logistic regression analyses
   showed that men in the upper tertile of testosterone levels had a lower
   risk of being characterized by 3 or more features of the metabolic
   syndrome (odds ratio=0.24, P<.04) independent of age, whereas tertiles
   of DHEA-S levels were not related to the metabolic syndrome independent
   of age. In conclusion, results suggest that age per se is an important
   correlate of the associations between DHEA-S and metabolic variables,
   whereas the association of plasma testosterone levels to features of the
   metabolic syndrome appears to be independent of age. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The declining health of high-elevation red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.)
   and Fraser fir (Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir.) in the southern Appalachian
   region has long been linked to nitrogen (N) deposition. Recently, N
   deposition has also been proposed as a source of negative health impacts
   in lower elevation deciduous forests. In 1998 we established 46 plots on
   six sites in North Carolina and Virginia dominated by American beech
   (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), and
   yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt). We evaluated several
   response variables across an N deposition gradient, including annual
   basal area growth; foliage percent N, Al, P, K, Mg, and Ca; and forest
   floor percent N, Mg, and C, pH, and potential net nitrification and N
   mineralization rates. We found a significant linear relationship between
   N deposition and basal area growth in sugar maple, but not in American
   beech or yellow birch. In addition, we found a significant relationship
   between N deposition and foliar chemistry (foliar \%N in all species,
   foliar Mg/N and \%K in sugar maple, and \%P in sugar maple and yellow
   birch). Foliar \%N of the three studied species was high relative to
   values reported in other studies in the United States and Canada.
   Several forest floor response variables (\%N, C/N, pH, Mg/N, and
   potential net nitrification and N mineralization rates and
   nitrification/mineralization fractions) were also correlated with N
   deposition. The correlations between the above response variables and N
   deposition are consistent with the influence of chronic N deposition on
   forested ecosystems measured in other regions and suggest that chronic N
   deposition may be influencing forest structure and chemistry within the
   southern region.}},

Abstract = {{Application of different analytical techniques contributed with new
   results to the interpretation and the provenance study of Venezuelan
   figurines dating from the 12th and 15th centuries. Elements in bulk
   samples, powdered samples of figurines and soil were determined using
   total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF), instrumental neutron
   activation analysis (INAA) and prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA).
   Results and ceramics macroscopic observations indicate that average
   elemental composition of the figurines from the mainland significantly
   differ from those encountered on the Caribbean islands. The
   multidisciplinary experience de facto formed a group dedicated to
   archaeometry and provided data for provenance study of pre-Hispanic
   pottery figurines.}},

Abstract = {{Angus crossbred steers were assigned randomly to one of four finishing
   diets based on corn, Chinook, Logan, or H3 barley. Steers were harvested
   and after a 72-h chill, carcass quality and yield grade data were
   collected. Beer ribs were removed from 72 carcasses for further
   analysis. Ribs were aged in vacuum bag at 2 degrees C for 14 days. After
   aging three adjacent steaks (3.18 cm) were removed to determine color
   stability, tenderness, proximate analysis and pH. Diets fed to steers
   had no effect on quality and yield grade or tenderness of beef steaks.
   Steaks from steers fed Logan barley variety were significantly less red
   at 10 days of storage (Hunter a{*} = 24.06) than steaks from steers fed
   the other barley varieties (Chinook a{*} = 26.4; H3 a{*} = 28.05) or
   corn (a{*} = 26.14). Identification of barley varieties that affect
   color stability could result in designing diets specifically for
   improved color and increase the use of barley as a finishing grain. (c)

Title = {{Expiratory flow limitation is associated with orthopnea and reversed by
   vasodilators and diuretics in left heart failure}},
Journal = {{CHEST}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1050-1057}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: In patients with acute left heart failure (LHF), orthopnea
   has also been related to the occurrence or worsening of expiratory flow
   limitation (EFL) in the supine position. We wished to assess whether
   short-term treatment with vasodilators and diuretics was able to abolish
   supine EFL and whether this could help to control orthopnea in patients
   with acute LHF.
   Methods: In nine nonobese (ie, mean {[}+/- SD] body mass index, 24 +/- 5
   kg/m(2)), never-smoker patients (two men and seven women; mean age, 77
   +/- 7 years) with acute LHF (mean ejection fraction, 43 +/- 15\%), we
   assessed EFL by the negative expiratory pressure method and dyspnea by
   the Borg scale, with patients in both the seated and supine positions,
   before and after short-term treatment with vasodilators and diuretics
   until hospital discharge. Orthopnea was defined as a positive difference
   in the Borg score between measurements made with the patient in the
   supine and seated positions. Postural variations in the end-expiratory
   lung volume were inferred from changes in inspiratory capacity (IC) that
   were measured under the same circumstances.
   Results: Before treatment, with the patient in the seated position the
   mean dvspnea score was 1.5 +/- 0.5, the mean IC was 1.49 +/- 0.38 L,
   seven patients were non-flow-limited, and two patients were
   flow-limited. During recumbency, the mean dyspnea score was 2.7 +/- 0.5
   (p < 0.01 vs seated position values), the mean IC was 1.66 +/- 0.45 L,
   and seven patients exhibited EFL. After a mean duration of 17 +/- 8 days
   of treatment (range, 7 to 28 days), EFL was detected in two patients
   only in the supine position, IC increased both in the seated position
   (1.65 +/- 0.34 L; p < 0.01) and the supine position (1.81 +/- 0.41 L; p
   = 0.07) position, and, although only two patients denied orthopnea, the
   mean dyspnea score during recumbency actually decreased to 1.9 +/- 1.0
   (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that short-term treatment with
   vasodilators and diuretics is able to control orthopnea and to remove
   supine EFL in most patients with acute LHF, suggesting a posture-related
   increase in bronchial obstruction as the main mechanism of EFL, which
   appears to play a role in the occurrence and severity of orthopnea in
   these circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{A Wigner-Poisson kinetic equation describing charge transport in doped
   semiconductor superlattices, is proposed. Electrons are assumed to
   occupy the lowest miniband, exchange of lateral momentum is ignored and
   the electron-electron interaction is treated in the Hartree
   approximation. There are elastic collisions with impurities and
   inelastic collisions with phonons, imperfections, etc. The latter are
   described by a modified BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) collision model that
   allows for energy dissipation while yielding charge continuity. In the
   hyperbolic limit, nonlocal drift-diffusion equations are derived
   systematically from the kinetic Wigner-Poisson-BGK system by means of
   the Chapman-Enskog method. The nonlocality of the original quantum
   kinetic model equations implies that the derived drift-diffusion
   equations contain spatial averages over one or more superlattice
   periods. Numerical solutions of the latter equations show self-sustained
   oscillations of the current through a voltage biased superlattice, in
   agreement with known experiments.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Florida law allows judges to withhold adjudication of guilt for persons
   who have either pled guilty or been found guilty of a felony. This
   provision may apply only to persons who will be sentenced to probation,
   and it allows such individuals to retain all civil rights and to
   truthfully assert they had not been convicted of a felony. This paper
   examines the effects of race and Hispanic ethnicity on the withholding
   of adjudication for 91,477 males sentenced to probation in Florida
   between 1999 and 2002. Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling is used
   to assess the direct effects of defendant attributes as well as the
   cross-level interactions between race, ethnicity and community level
   indicators of threat, such as percentage black and Hispanic and
   concentrated disadvantage. Our results show that Hispanics and blacks
   are significantly less likely to have adjudication withheld when other
   individual and community level factors are controlled. This effect is
   especially pronounced for blacks and for drug offenders. Cross-level
   interactions show that concentrated disadvantage has a substantial
   effect on the adjudication withheld outcome for both black and Hispanic
   defendants. The implications of these results for the conceptualization
   of racial/ethnic threat at the individual, situational and social levels
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the prevalence of swelling and oedema of the hand
   in stroke patients and relationships with impairments and disability.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Setting: Stroke unit at Rehabilitation Centre De Hoogstraat, the
   Netherlands.
   Subjects: Eighty-eight adult stroke patients who were admitted for
   clinical rehabilitation during one year (2000).
   Measurements and methods: Assessment took place two weeks after
   admission to the rehabilitation centre. Degree of swelling was measured
   with a hand volumeter and oedema was defined as a volumeter score
   deviating more than two standard deviations from the expected score
   derived from population data. Further assessment included tonus
   (Modified Ashworth Score), sensibility, tactile inattention,
   carefulness, and motor function (Utrecht Arm/Hand Test). Arm disability
   was measured with Frenchay Arm Test and Nine-hole Peg Test.
   Results: Some degree of hand swelling was present in 72.7\% and oedema
   in 33.0\% of our patients. Swelling and oedema were significantly more
   often seen in patients with hypertonic fingers and impaired sensibility.
   Patients with hand oedema had significantly worse Frenchay Arm Test and
   Nine-hole Peg Test scores.
   Conclusions: Swelling and oedema of the hand are common among stroke
   patients in clinical rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model of pastoralists, as illustrated by reindeer
   herders, together with an analysis based on a cross-sectional data set
   on Swedish reindeer herding Saami. The intrinsic utility of being an
   active reindeer herder plays an important role in determining supply.
   Results show this can lead to unconventional supply responses among
   pastoralists, and suggest that the probability of a backward bending
   supply response increases with stock size. Further analyses confirm that
   reindeer herders with backward-bending supply curves have significantly
   larger herds than herders with conventional supply responses. Relaxed
   externalities from forestry would cause most herders to increase their
   slaughter.}},

Volume = {{129}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Infection is the primary cause of death after liver
   transplantation. Mannose binding lectin (MBL) is a recognition molecule
   of the lectin pathway of complement and a key component of innate
   immunity. MBL variant alleles have been described in the coding region
   of the MBL gene, which are associated with low MBL serum concentration
   and impaired MBL structure and function. The aims of our study were to
   establish the role of the liver in production of serum MBL and to
   evaluate the effect of MBL variant alleles on the susceptibility to
   infection after liver transplantation. Methods: We investigated 49
   patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. MBL exon :1 and
   promoter polymorphisms were determined in patients and in liver donors.
   MBL serum concentration was determined before and during :1 year after
   transplantation. The incidence of clinically significant infections
   during this period was assessed. Results: Transplantation of MBL
   wildtype recipients with donor livers carrying MBL variant alleles
   resulted in a rapid and pronounced decrease of serum MBL levels. This
   serum conversion was associated with the disappearance of high molecular
   weight MBL. No indication for extrahepatic production of serum MBL could
   be obtained. The presence of MBL variant alleles in the MBL gene of the
   donor liver, but not in the recipient, was associated with a strongly
   increased incidence of clinically significant infections after
   transplantation. Conclusions: Serum MBL is produced by the liver under
   strong genetic control. After liver transplantation, the MBL genotype of
   the donor liver is a major risk determinant for life-threatening
   infections.}},

Title = {{Some aspects of jump-defects in the quantum sine-Gordon model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The classical sine-Gordon model permits integrable discontinuities, or
   jump-defects, where the conditions relating the fields on either side of
   a defect are Backlund transformations frozen at the defect location. The
   purpose of this article is to explore the extent to which this idea may
   be extended to the quantum sine-Gordon model and how the striking
   features of the classical model may translate to the quantum version.
   Assuming a positive defect parameter there are two types of defect. One
   type, carrying even charge, is stable, but the other type, carrying odd
   charge, is unstable and may be considered as a resonant bound state of a
   soliton and a stable defect. The scattering of solitons with defects is
   considered in detail, as is the scattering of breathers, and in all
   cases the jump-defect is purely transmitting. One surprising discovery
   concerns the lightest breather. Its transmission factor is independent
   of the bulk coupling - a property susceptible to a perturbative check,
   but not shared with any of the other breathers. It is argued that
   classical jump-defects can move and some comments are made concerning
   their quantum scattering matrix.}},

Abstract = {{G-protein-coupled receptors play a major role in the activation of the
   innate immune system, such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Members of
   the formyl peptide receptor family recognize chemotactic peptides as
   well the amyloid-beta peptide and fragments of the human
   immunodeficiency virus envelope and may thus be implicated in major
   pathologies. The peptide WKYMVm-NH2 probably activates the receptor
   FPRL1 and its mouse orthologues Fpr-rs1 and Fpr-rs2. We examined the
   stimulation of C57BL6 mouse neutrophils by WKYMVm-NH2 and the effects of
   several inhibitors for intracellular signalling pathways (wortmannin, LY
   294002, staurosporin, H-89, U 73122, thapsigargin and SKF 96365). We
   show here that WKYMVm-NH2 is a powerful stimulator of primary and
   secondary granule exocytosis as well as superoxide production. The
   signalling pathway involves phosphoinositide 3-kinase, protein kinase C,
   phospholipase C and store-operated calcium influx. Studies with peptide
   antagonists suggest that WKYMVm-NH2 preferentially activates exocytosis
   via FPRL1 and not FPR, the major receptor for N-formylated peptides such
   as fMLF. However, the signalling pathways activated by WKYMVm-NH2 in
   mouse neutrophils are similar to those activated by fMLF in human
   neutrophils. Thus, the effect and the signalling pathways of the two
   agonists and their receptors are at least partially overlapping.}},

Abstract = {{Oral ingestion of pesticides can be a major exposure route. These
   compounds are frequently consumed in the presence of triacylglycerides,
   which are then hydrolyzed to free fatty acids. The purpose of this work
   was to examine the effect of two common fatty acids, palmitic (PA) and
   oleic (OA) acids, and the biological emulsifier sodium taurocholate (TC)
   on the absorption of three herbicides (trifluralin, alachlor and
   atrazine) by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Trifluralin's absorption was
   enhanced (p < 0.05) in the presence of OA whereas the greatest
   absorption of atrazine and alachlor occurred with PA and the control
   media, respectively. Trifluralin had significantly lower absorption
   through the monolayer than either alachlor or atrazine (p < 0.001). A
   mass balance study demonstrated that trifluralin accumulated within the
   cell monolayer (13.85\% of the donor after 3 h of exposure), but
   alachlor and atrazine (1.27\% and 0.85\%, respectively) did not. This
   response was linear with time (21.89\% trifluralin after 6 h of
   exposure), and demonstrated the potential for continued release of
   trifluralin after source removal. These experiments demonstrated that
   fatty acids and an emuslifier can influence absorption of herbicides
   across small intestinal epithelium. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   underlying the dephasing mechanism associated to the damping of the

   Pill as a therapeutic agent for cancer. However, the receptors and
   effector mechanisms responsible for its broad tumoricidal function
   remain undefined. Here, we examined the roles played by natural
   cytotoxicity receptors (NCR), killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors,
   cytolytic granule components, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family
   members in tumor recognition and lysis by TALL-104 cells. The
   perforin-granzyme pathway, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
   (TRAIL), and Fas were each involved in the lysis of particular tumor
   targets by TALL-104. Furthermore, phorbol 12-myristate
   13-acetate/ionomycin treatment induced surface expression of Fas-L and
   TRAIL. In addition, supernatants from CD3-stimulated TALL-104 cultures
   exhibited antiproliferative activity, which was blocked 50-90\% by
   anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (mAb). Although negative for the NCR
   natural killer (NK)p44, this cell line was found to express NKp46. An
   anti-NKp46 antibody strongly blocked TALL-104-mediated lysis of certain
   targets and directly induced cytokine production, granule release, and
   redirected lysis responses. Anti-NKG2D and anti-2B4 also stimulated
   redirected c),totoxicity by TALL-104. By contrast, anti-NKG2A mAb, did
   not stain the cells or inhibit killing responses. Alternatively, KIR3DL2
   was detected on TALL-104, mid expression of its reported ligand, human
   leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, on target cells provided protection from
   cytotoxicity. Thus, NKp46, NKG2D, and 2B4 are activating receptors, and
   KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor on TALL-104. The data demonstrate the
   ability of TALL-104 cells to recognize a wide variety of tumors with NK
   cell receptors mid kill them with a broad arsenal of cytolytic effector
   mechanisms, including cytolytic granules and TNF family ligands.}},

Abstract = {{Certain viruses can infect neurons and cause persistent infections with
   restricted expression of viral proteins. To study the consequences of
   such viral proteins on synaptic functions, the effects of two influenza
   A virus proteins, the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and the
   nucleoprotein (NP), were analyzed in cultures of rat hippocampal
   neurons. Transduction of the NS1 and NP proteins into the neurons was
   performed by applying the 11 - amino acid peptide transduction domain
   (PTD) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) TAT coupled to the viral
   proteins. Neurons exposed to the NS1 and NP fusion proteins (NS1-PTD and
   NP-PTD, respectively) for 4 h were immunopositive for these proteins as
   diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. After exposure for 48 h to
   NP-PTD, a punctate pattern of the immunolabel appeared in dendritic
   spinelike processes. Electrophysiologically, a reduction in both the
   frequency of spontaneous excitatory synaptic activity and in the
   amplitude of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents were
   recorded after exposing the hippocampal neurons to NP-PTD between 17 and
   22 days in culture. These changes may reflect disturbances in
   postsynaptic functions. No such alterations in synaptic activities were
   recorded after exposure to NS1-PTD or to green fluorescent protein -
   PTD, which was used as a control. Based on these findings the authors
   hypothesize that the viral NP, by its localization to dendritic
   spinelike structures, interferes with the expression or anchoring of
   postsynaptic glutamate receptors and thereby disturbs synaptic
   functions. Thus a persistent viral infection in the brain may be
   associated with functional disturbances at the synaptic level.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E}},

Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We study theoretically the dynamical reorientation phenomena when a
   long-pitch cholesteric liquid-crystal film with homeotropic alignment is
   illuminated by a circularly polarized lightwave. In the present case,
   the natural cholesteric pitch is of the order of (or larger than) the
   film thickness. The helical cholesteric structure is thus frustrated by
   the boundary conditions without illumination. However, above a light
   intensity threshold reorientation occurs and the bifurcation scenario
   depends strongly on the natural cholesteric pitch. Recalling that a
   long-pitch cholesteric is achieved in practice by adding a small amount
   of chiral agents in a nematic liquid crystal, the observed dynamics can
   be viewed as the result of the competition between intrinsic and
   extrinsic unidimensional helical patterns. The intrinsic part consists
   of the helical deformations induced by the chirality of the dopant,
   whereas the extrinsic part is related to the chirality induced by the
   optical field through the non-uniform angular momentum transfer of light
   to a nematic. The all-optical analog in the case of a pure nematic
   (without chiral dopant), is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a systematic technique for designing prototype
   filters for generating perfect-reconstruction (PR) orthogonal
   cosine-modulated and modified discrete Fourier transform filterbanks. In
   the proposed design scheme, the stopband energy of the prototype filter
   is minimized, and the basic unknowns are the angles of a special lattice
   structure used for implementing the prototype filter so that the PR
   property is automatically satisfied independent of the angle values.
   This selection of the unknowns makes the overall optimization problem
   unconstrained.
   Due to the fact that there are several local optima, the design is
   performed in multiple steps in order to arrive at least at a very good
   suboptimal solution. First, for the given number of channels, the length
   of the channel filters, and the stopband edge of the prototype filter,
   the corresponding two-channel filterbank is designed based on the
   preoptimized data. Then, after knowing the angles for the optimized
   two-channel case, the prototype filter for the desired filterbank is
   generated by gradually increasing the number of channels and by properly
   using the result of the previous step as a start-up solution for the
   present step. The main benefit of the proposed design technique is that
   it enables one to effectively design prototype filters for filterbanks
   with very high-order analysis and synthesis filters.}},

   n(b)/n(p)less than or similar to 0.53, the most unstable modes are a mix
   between filamentation and two-stream instabilities. Beyond this limit,
   filamentation instability may dominate, depending on the beam

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a device type is presented in which the conventional
   geometry for the flexoelectro-optic effect is rotated, utilizing
   planar-aligned short-pitch chiral nematic and in-plane electric fields.
   The cell is optically neutral at zero applied field due to having its
   helix axis lie in the direction of light propagation, and at optical
   communication wavelengths (1550 nm) polarization rotation is
   insignificant due to the helical pitch of the material being shorter
   than the illuminating wavelength. An electric field, applied in the
   plane of the cell, has been found to induce a birefringence via a
   combination of dielectric helix unwinding and flexoelectric deformation
   of the director helix. The magnitude of the birefringence and direction
   of the induced optic axis in the plane of the cell are dependent on the
   amplitude and direction of the applied electric field, providing
   potential for use in a fast endlessly rotatable polarization controller.
   Herein, the chiral nematic materials utilized in the cell are
   bimesogenic liquid crystals designed to optimize the contribution from
   the flexoelectro-optic effect, and eliminate dielectric helix unwinding.
   The materials are also polymer network stabilized to preserve the
   texture against degradation in the applied fields. The results presented
   show a progression from a combined dielectric and flexoelectrically
   induced birefringence of 0.016 at field strengths up to 6.8 V/mu m, to a
   purely flexoelectric-induced birefringence of 0.0135, sufficient for a
   quarter wave plate in a 29-mu m-thick cell. Response times are of the
   order of hundreds of microseconds for both reaction to an applied field
   and relaxation upon removal. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Using survey data and an equilibrium displacement model, we estimate the
   market and economic impacts of the American Forest and Paper
   Association's Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) on stumpage markets
   in the US South. We examine four timber product markets: softwood
   pulpwood, softwood sawtimber, hardwood pulpwood, and hardwood sawtimber.
   In each market we calculate changes in producer and consumer welfare
   using the equilibrium displacement model that accounts for reductions in
   timber inventories caused by SFI compliance. We find that SFI compliance
   costs the US South's economy about \$36 million annually. SFI-compliant
   stumpage producers lose more than \$33 million each year in producer
   surplus as a result of SFI compliance, and consumers lose about \$12
   million annually in consumer surplus due to higher product prices. These
   costs are offset partially by benefits to nonindustrial private forest
   producers, non-SFI-compliant industry producers, and public forest
   producers, who collectively gain about \$10 million in producer surplus
   annually as a result of higher stumpage prices.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We investigated whether US Army Gulf War veterans who were
   potentially exposed to nerve agents during the March 1991 weapons
   demolitions at Khamisiyah, Iraq, are at increased risk of cause-specific
   mortality.
   Methods. The cause-specific mortality of 100487 exposed US Army Gulf War
   veterans was compared with that of 224980 unexposed US Army Gulf War
   veterans. Exposure was determined with the Department of Defense 2000
   plume model. Relative risk estimates were derived from Cox proportional
   hazards models.
   Results. The risks of most disease-related mortality were similar for
   exposed and unexposed veterans. However, exposed veterans had an
   increased risk of brain cancer deaths (relative risk {[}RR]= 1.94; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}Cl]= 1.12, 3.34). The risk of brain cancer death
   was larger among those exposed 2 or more days than those exposed 1 day
   when both were compared separately to all unexposed veterans (RR=3.26;
   95\% Cl = 1.33, 7.96; RR= 1.72; 95\% Cl =0.95,3.10, respectively).
   Conclusions. Exposure to chemical munitions at Khamisiyah may be
   associated with an increased risk of brain cancer death. Additional
   research is required to confirm this finding.}},

   informant effects and the shared environment}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1133-1144}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background. Research has documented high levels of co-morbidity among
   childhood externalizing disorders, but its etiology remains in dispute.
   Specifically, although all behavior genetic studies of the etiology of
   the co-occurrence of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
   oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD) agree
   that genetic factors are important, differences exist across studies in
   the relative weight assigned to genetic, shared environmental factors
   (i.e. factors that increase similarity among family members), and
   non-shared environmental factors (i.e. factors that decrease similarity
   among family members). Because heritability estimates can vary across
   informants, we used a biometric informant-effects model to determine
   whether these discrepancies were a function of systematic differences in
   maternal and child informant reports of ADHD, CD, and ODD.
   Method. We studied 1782 11-year-old twins from the Minnesota Twin Family
   Study. Symptom counts for each disorder were obtained from interviews
   administered to twins and their mothers. We fit a model that allowed us
   to examine, both across and within informants, the genetic and
   environmental contributions to the co-occurrence among ADHD, CD, and
   ODD.
   Results. The results revealed that the co-occurrence among the disorders
   common to maternal and child informant reports was influenced largely by
   shared environmental forces. Genetic factors also contributed, though
   their impact was only marginally significant. In contrast, the
   co-occurrence unique to each informant was influenced exclusively by
   either genetic or non-shared environmental factors.
   Conclusions. Such findings offer additional evidence that shared
   environmental factors are important to the co-morbidity among ADHD, CD,
   and ODD, and highlight the necessity of considering informant effects
   when drawing conclusions about the origins of co-morbidity from analyses
   of genetically informative data.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-subunit RNA polymerases bind nucleotide triphosphate (NTP)
   substrates in the pretranslocated state and carry the dNMP-NTP base pair
   into the active site for phosphoryl transfer. NTP-driven translocation
   requires that NTP substrates enter the main-enzyme channel before
   loading into the active site. Based on this model, a new view of
   fidelity and efficiency of RNA synthesis is proposed. The model predicts
   that, during processive elongation, NTP-driven translocation is coupled
   to a protein conformational change that allows pyrophosphate release:
   coupling the end of one bond-addition cycle to substrate loading and
   translocation for the next. We present a detailed model of the RNA
   polymerase II elongation complex based on 2 low-affinity NTP binding
   sites located in the main-enzyme channel. This model posits that NTP
   substrates, elongation factors, and the conserved Rpb2 subunit fork loop
   2 cooperate to regulate opening of the downstream transcription bubble.}},

   attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring. However,
   it is not clear whether maternal smoking during pregnancy is
   independently associated with antisocial behaviour or whether the
   association arises because antisocial behaviour and ADHD covary.
   Aims To examine the relationship between maternal smoking during
   pregnancy, antisocial behaviour and ADHD in offspring.
   Method Questionnaires concerning behaviour and environmental factors
   were sent to twins from the CaStANET study and data analysed using a
   number of bivariate structural equation models.
   Results Maternal prenatal smoking contributed small but significant
   amounts to the variance of ADHD and of antisocial behaviour. The best
   fitting bivariate model was one in which maternal prenatal smoking had a
   specific influence on each phenotype, independent of the effect on the
   other phenotype.
   Conclusions Both antisocial behaviour and ADHD symptoms in offspring are
   independently influenced by maternal prenatal smoking during pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Several syndromes characterized by defects in cardiovascular and
   craniofacial development are associated with a hemizygous deletion of
   chromosome 22q11 in humans and involve defects in pharyngeal arch and
   neural crest cell development. Recent efforts have focused on
   identifying 22q11 deletion syndrome modifying loci. In this study, we
   show that mouse embryos deficient for Gbx2 display aberrant neural crest
   cell patterning and defects in pharyngeal arch-derived structures.
   Gbx2(-/-) embryos exhibit cardiovascular defects associated with
   aberrant development of the fourth pharyngeal arch arteries including
   interrupted aortic arch type B, right aortic arch, and retroesophageal
   right subclavian artery. Other developmental abnormalities include
   overriding aorta, ventricular septal defects, cranial nerve, and
   craniofacial skeletal patterning defects. Recently, Fgf8 has been
   proposed as a candidate modifier for 22q11 deletion syndromes. Here, we
   demonstrate that Fgf8 and Gbx2 expression overlaps in regions of the
   developing pharyngeal arches and that they interact genetically during
   pharyngeal arch and cardiovascular development. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {{LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{37}},

Pages = {{161-171}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Both photobiomodulation (PBM) and olfactory
   ensheathing cells (OECs) transplantation improve recovery following
   spinal cord injury. However, neither the combination of these two
   therapies nor the effect of light on OECs has been reported. The purpose
   of this study was to determine the effect of light on OEC activity in
   vitro.
   Materials and Methods: OECs were purified from adult rat olfactory bulbs
   and exposed to 810 nm light (150 mW; 0, 0.2, or 68 J/cm(2)). After 7-21
   days in vitro, cells underwent immunocytochernistry or RNA extraction
   and RT-PCR.
   Results: Analysis of immunolabeling revealed a significant decrease in
   fibronectin expression in the cultures receiving 68 J/cm(2). Analysis of
   gene expression revealed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in brain
   derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial derived neurotrophic factor
   (GDNF), and collagen expression in the 0.2 j/cm(2) group in comparison
   to the non-irradiated and 68 J/cm(2) groups. OEC proliferation was also
   found to significantly increase in both light treated groups in
   comparison to the control group (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that low and high dosages of PBM
   alter OEC activity, including upregulation of a number of neurotrophic
   growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins known to support
   neurite outgrowth. Therefore, the application of PBM in conjunction with
   OEC transplantation warrants consideration as a potential combination
   therapy for spinal cord injury.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: One of the factors suggested to be causative in hernia
   formation is defective collagen metabolism. In this study, we
   investigated whether there is any relationship between the collagen
   contents of indirect hernial sacs and certain demographic and anatomic
   parameters. Methods: Hernial sac hydroxyproline levels were measured in
   100 pediatric and 23 adult indirect inguinal hernia cases as indicators
   of collagen concentrations. Hydroxyproline levels were compared between
   boys and girls, right and left sided hernias, unilateral and bilateral
   cases, children and adults. Whether there was any relationship between
   patient age and hydroxyproline level was also investigated. Results: No
   difference was found between males and females (p > 0.05), right and
   left sided hernias (p > 0.05) or unilateral and bilateral cases (p >
   0.05). Hydroxyproline levels of adults were found to be significantly
   higher than those of children (p = 0.000). There was also a positive
   correlation between age and hydroxyproline levels of boys (r = 0.285, p
   = 0.023). Conclusion: Although a relationship between direct inguinal
   hernia and collagen structure has been shown by some investigators, we
   were unable to point to any significant findings which would indicate
   such a relationship in indirect inguinal hernia cases. Further studies
   on hydroxyproline levels in peritoneal samples will be necessary to
   understand the role of peritoneal hydroxyproline levels in hernia

Title = {{Seven versus ten days of rabeprazole triple therapy for Helicobacter
   pylori eradication: A multicenter randomized trial}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Ten-day triple therapy is somewhat more effective than 7-day
   treatment for curing Helicobacter pylori infection. Recent studies have
   suggested that rabeprazole-a proton pump inhibitor with fast onset of
   acid inhibition-could raise the efficacy of 7-day therapies to the
   levels obtained with 10-day treatment.
   OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of 7- and 10-day rabeprazole-based
   triple therapy for H. pylori eradication.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred and fifty-eight patients were
   randomized to 7 or 10 days of triple therapy, including rabeprazole 20
   mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and amoxicillin 1 g, all twice a day. Cure
   rates were evaluated by urea breath test.
   RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-seven patients received 7-day and 221
   received 10-day therapy. Groups were comparable in terms of demographic
   variables. Intention to treat cure rates were 73.8\% (95\% CI: 67-79\%)
   for 7-day and 79.6\% (95\%: CI:74-85\%) for 10-day therapy (p= 0.09).
   Per-protocol cure rates were 81.8\% (95\% CI:76-o86\%) and 89.3\% (95\%
   CI: 84-93\%), p= 0.02, respectively. Cure rates were similar in peptic
   ulcer patients but in subjects without ulcer they were clearly lower for
   7-day therapy: 66\%versus 77\% by intention to treat (p= 0.08) and
   73\%versus 91\% in the per-protocol analysis (p= 0.004). Side effects
   and compliance in the two groups were comparable.
   CONCLUSIONS: Seven- and 10-day triple therapies seem equally efficient
   in peptic ulcer patients. In contrast, 7-day therapy is significantly
   less effective in nonulcer dyspepsia patients. Ten-day therapy,
   therefore, seems preferable when treating nonulcer patients.}},

   compared with the reference site and if northern water snakes were
   suitable bioindicators of metal contamination. Except for chromium,
   metal levels were significantly higher in tissues (kidney, liver,
   muscle, and skin) of EFPC northern water snakes compared with those in
   tissues of snakes from the reference site. Although female northern
   water snakes were significantly larger than male snakes, their tissues
   did not contain significantly higher metal concentrations compared with
   those from male snakes, possibly because of maternal transfer of metals

Abstract = {{We present an analysis of the cellular phenotype and biochemical
   activity of a conserved bacterial GTPase of unknown function (YloQ and
   YjeQ in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli respectively) using a
   collection of antibiotics of diverse mechanisms and chemical classes. We
   created a yloQ deletion strain, which exhibited a slow growth phenotype
   and formed chains of filamentous cells. Additionally, we constructed a
   conditional mutant in yloQ, where growth was dependent on inducible
   expression from a complementing copy of the gene. In phenotypic studies,
   depletion of yloQ sensitized cells to antibiotics that bind at the
   peptide channel or peptidyl transferase centre, providing the first
   chemical genetic evidence linking this GTPase to ribosome function.
   Additional experiments using these small-molecule probes in vitro
   revealed that aminoglycoside antibiotics severely affected a previously
   characterized ribosome-associated GTPase activity of purified,
   recombinant YjeQ from E. coli. None of the antibiotics tested competed
   with YjeQ for binding to 30 or 70 S ribosomes. A closer examination of
   YloQ depletion revealed that the polyribosome profiles were altered and
   that decreased expression of YloQ led to the accumulation of ribosomal
   subunits at the expense of intact 70 S ribosomes. The present study
   provides the first evidence showing that YloQ/YjeQ may be involved in
   several areas of cellular metabolism, including cell division and
   ribosome function.}},

Volume = {{128}},

Abstract = {{Study objectives: The aims of this study were to analyze mortality in
   patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) treated
   with positive airway pressure (PAP) and to know whether PAP compliance
   affects survival, as well as to investigate the prognostic value of
   several pretreatment variables.
   Design and patients: A study was made of an historical cohort of 871
   patients in whom OSAHS had been diagnosed by sleep study between January
   1994 and December 2000 and who had been treated with PAP. Patients were
   followed up until December 2001. The mean (+/- SD) age of the group was
   55.4 +/- 10.6 years, the mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 55.1 +/- 28.7,
   and 80.9\% were men. To assess whether mortality was influenced by PAP
   therapy compliance, patients were assigned to one of the following
   compliance categories: < 1 h/d; I to 6 h/d; or > 6 h/d. Survival rates
   were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival curves
   were compared with the log-rank test and the trend test, when necessary.
   Univariate and multivariate analyses using a time-dependent Cox model
   were performed to elicit which variables correlated with mortality.
   Setting: Outpatient sleep disorders unit.
   Results: By the end of the follow-up period (mean duration, 48.5 +/-
   22.7 months), 46 patients had died. The 5-year cumulative survival rates
   were significantly lower in patients who did not use PAP (compliance <
   1h) than in those who used the device for > 6 h/d (85.5\% {[}95\%
   confidence interval (0), 0.78 to 0.92] vs 96.4\% {[}95\% CI, 0.94 to
   0.98; < 0.00005]) and I to 6 h/d (85.5\% {[}95\% CI, 0.78 to 0.92] vs
   91.3\% {[} 95\% CI, 0.88 to 0.94; p = 0.01]), respectively. A trend in
   survival rates across the groups was identified (p = 0.0004). The main
   cause of death in 19 cases was cardiovascular disease (CVD). Variables
   that independently correlated with mortality in the multivariate
   analysis were the following PAP use categories: compliance for > 6 h/d
   (odds ratio {[}OR], 0.10; 95\% CI, 0.04 to 0.29); compliance for I to 6
   h/d (OR, 0.28; 95\% CI, 0.11 to 0.69); arterial hypertension (AHT)
   {[}OR, 3.25; 95\% CI, 1.24 to 8.54]; age (OR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 1.01 to
   1.10); and FEV1 percent predicted (OR, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.94 to 0.98).
   Conclusion: Mortality rates in OSAHS patients who did not receive PAP
   therapy were higher compared with those treated with PAP and were
   moderately or highly compliant with therapy. A trend in survival across
   compliance categories was found. Patients died mainly from CVD.
   Categories of PAP compliance, AHT, age, and FEV, percent predicted were
   the variables that independently predicted mortality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a neural network-based digital redesign approach for
   digital control of continuous-time chaotic systems with unknown
   structures and parameters. Important features of the method are that:
   (i) it generalizes the existing optimal linearization approach for the
   class of state-space models which are nonlinear in the state but linear
   in the input, to models which are nonlinear in both the state and the
   input; (ii) it develops a neural network-based universal optimal linear
   state-space model for unknown chaotic systems; (iii) it develops an
   anti-digital redesign approach for indirectly estimating an analog
   control law from a fast-rate digital control law without utilizing the
   analog models. The estimated analog control law is then converted to a
   slow-rate digital control law via the prediction-based digital redesign
   method; (iv) it develops a linear time-varying piecewise-constant
   low-gain tracker which can be implemented using microprocessors.
   Illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed methodology.}},

Title = {{The treatment of patients with symptomatic common bile duct stenosis
   secondary to chronic pancreatitis using partially covered metal stents:
   A pilot study}},
Journal = {{ENDOSCOPY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{735-739}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background and Study Aims: Although surgery remains the gold standard
   for the treatment of symptomatic common bile duct stenosis associated
   with chronic pancreatitis, plastic and self-expandable open-mesh stents
   have been proposed as alternative treatments. These may dysfunction,
   however, mainly due to stent occlusion by clogging or by hyperplasia of
   inflammatory tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety
   and long-term results of using partially covered metal stents in this
   setting.
   Patients and Methods: A total of 14 patients (12 men, 2 women; mean age
   50 3 years) underwent partially covered metal stent insertion for common
   bile duct stenosis secondary to chronic pancreatitis (12 alcohol
   -related, two idiopathic). They had all been treated previously with
   plastic prostheses.
   Results: Either a 40-mm (n = 13) or a 60-mm (n = 1) partially covered
   metal stent was placed, depending on the length of the common bile duct
   stenosis and the level of the cystic duct bifurcation. Stent placement
   was successful, with resolution of cholangitis and improvement in
   cholestasis, in all patients. During the median follow-up period of 22
   months (range 12-33 months) seven patients developed dysfunction of the
   stent and required re-treatment. At 12, 24, and 30 months, the stent
   patency rates were 100\%, 40\%, and 37.5\% respectively.
   Conclusions: While partially covered metal stenting is safe and
   effective for the initial treatment of chronic pancreatitis-associated
   common bile duct stenosis and shows promising short-term results,
   long-term data show that dysfunction occurs in 50\% of cases. In light
   of the continued interest in nonsurgical treatment of this condition,
   further research is warranted to investigate new stent designs with
   improved long-term patency.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), response to tyrosine kinase
   inhibitors (TKIs) is significantly associated with the presence of
   increased copy number and/or activating mutations of the epidermal
   growth factor receptor gene (EGFR). Preclinical data indicate that HER2,
   a member of the EGFR family, could enhance TKI sensitivity.
   Patients and Methods
   HER2 gene copy numbers per cell were evaluated by fluorescent in situ
   hybridization (FISH) in 102 NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib, and
   previously evaluated for EGFR status by FISH, immunohistochemistry, and
   presence of mutations.
   Results
   Patients with HER2 high copy number (high polysomy and gene
   amplification {[}HER2 FISH positive]) represented 22.8\% of patients,
   and compared with patients with no or low gain (HER2 FISH negative), had
   significantly better objective response (OR, 34.8\% v 6.4\%; P =.001),
   disease control rate OCR, 56.5\% v 33.3\%; P =.04), time to progression
   (TTP, 9.05 v 2.7 months; P =.02), and a trend toward longer overall
   survival (OS, 20.8 v 8.4 months; P =.056). HER2 protein expression
   investigated by immunohistochemistry was positive in only five of 72
   (7\%) patients analyzed and all 89 patients tested by DNA sequencing
   were negative for mutations in HER2 exon 20. Patients with HER2
   FISH-positive tumors displaying increased expression of EGFR protein,
   gene gain, or mutations (EGFR positive) had a significantly better OR,
   DCR, TTP, and OS than patients negative for both receptors.
   Conclusion
   Increased copy number of the HER2 gene is associated with gefitinib
   sensitivity in EGFR-positive patients, supporting use of HER2 FISH
   analysis for selection of patients for TKI therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Background Oncolytic viruses are promising anticancer agents because
   they selectively kill cancer cells and multiply within a tumor. Their
   oncolytic potency might be improved by expressing a therapeutic gene
   from the virus genome. In this regard, proper kinetics and level of
   transgene expression. are important. In addition, expression of
   cytotoxic transgene products should be confined to cancer cells. Here,
   we developed oncolytic adenoviruses that provide transgene expression
   dependent on viral replication.
   Methods We constructed an oncolytic adenovirus that expresses luciferase
   under regulation of the endogenous major late promoter (MLP) via
   alternative splicing to an inserted splice-acceptor site analogous to
   that of the adenovirus serotype 40 long fiber gene. Splicing of the
   luciferase transcript was studied by RT-PCR analysis. Expression was
   measured in the presence and absence of the flavonoid apigenin, an
   inhibitor of viral replication.
   Results The inserted splice-acceptor site was properly recognized by the
   adenoviral splicing machinery. Luciferase expression levels were
   markedly higher than levels obtained with the cytomegalovirus (CMV)
   promoter, especially at late stages of infection. inhibiting adenovirus
   replication reduced luciferase expression levels dramatically by 4 to 5
   logs, whereas expression levels with the CMV-luciferase adenovirus were
   only moderately affected (2 logs).
   Conclusions Transgene delivery using the endogenous late gene expression
   machinery resulted in an expression pattern distinct from expression
   driven by the conventional CMV promoter. The high expression levels and
   strict coupling of expression to viral replication should be useful for
   adequate monitoring of replication and might provide a platform for the
   design of armed conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds) with
   enhanced oncolytic potency. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we investigate the dynamic properties of hemoglobin in
   glycerolD(8)/D2O solution using incoherent elastic (ENS) and
   quasielastic (QENS) neutron scattering. Taking advantage of
   complementary energy resolutions of backscattering spectrometers at ILL
   (Grenoble), we explore motions in a large space-time window, up to 1 ns
   and 14 angstrom; moreover, in order to cover the harmonic and anharmonic
   protein dynamics regimes, the elastic experiments have been performed
   over the wide temperature interval of 20-300 K. To study the dependence
   of the measured dynamics upon the protein quaternary structure, both
   deoxyhemoglobin (in T quaternary conformation) and
   carbonmonoxyhemoglobin (in R quaternary conformation) have been
   investigated.
   From the ENS data the mean square displacements of the non-exchangeable
   hydrogen atoms of the protein and their temperature dependence are
   obtained. In agreement with previous results on hydrated powders, a
   dynamical transition at about 220 K is detected. The results show
   interesting differences between the two hemoglobin quaternary
   conformations, the T-state protein appearing more rigid and performing
   faster motions than the R-state one; however, these differences involve
   motions occurring in the nanosecond time scale and are not detected when
   only faster atomic motions in the time scale up to 100 ps are
   investigated.
   The QENS results put in evidence a relevant Lorentzian quasi-elastic
   contribution. Analysis of the dependence of the Elastic Incoherent
   Structure Factor (EISF) and of the Lorentzian halfwidth upon the
   momentum transfer suggests that the above quasi-elastic contribution
   arises from the diffusion inside a confined space, values of confinement
   radius and local diffusion coefficient being compatible with motions of
   hydrogen atoms of the amino acid side chains. When averaged over the
   whole range of momentum transfer the QENS data put in evidence
   differences between deoxy and carbonmonoxy hemoglobin and confirm the
   quaternary structure dependence of the protein dynamics in the
   nanosecond time scale. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first reported data on the embedding of highly
   dielectric ceramic inclusions in a rubbery host medium as a means to
   increase the electromechanical material response for dielectric
   elastomer actuation. The studied polymer/ceramic composite, consisting
   of a silicone matrix in which titanium dioxide powder was dispersed,
   exhibited, in comparison with pure silicone, a decreased elastic
   modulus, as well as an increased dielectric constant. The measured low
   frequency permittivity resulted in accordance with several classical
   dielectric mixing rules. The use of this material as elastomeric
   dielectric for planar actuators enabled a reduction of the driving
   electric fields, so that a transverse strain of 11\% at 10 V/mu m and a
   transverse stress of 16.5 kPa at 9 V/mu m were obtained. These levels of
   strain and stress were respectively more than eight and four times
   higher than the corresponding values generated with the pure polymer
   matrix for analogous electrical stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure measurements taken on the Monterey Bay continental shelf,
   within 4 km of the shelf break, reveal a complex mixing environment.
   Depth- and time-averaged dissipation rates (epsilon = 7.4-55.8 x 10(-9)
   W kg(-1)) and diapycnal diffusivities (K-P = 6.1 - 37.8 x 10(-5) m(2)
   s(-1)) were elevated above observations made over other continental
   shelves with no significant topography, but were below those influenced
   by topographic features. The close proximity of the shelf break/canyon
   rim, locally generated internal tides, and nonlinear internal waves all
   contributed to the elevated turbulence. The complex bathymetry
   associated with Monterey Submarine Canyon allowed an internal tide to be
   generated at depths greater than 1500m, as well as at the shelf break.
   The observed velocity field was normally dominated by upward energy
   propagation from the local shelf break generated internal tide, but near
   low tide downward energy propagation from a surface reflection of the
   internal tide generated below 1500m was observed. Turbulent dissipation
   rates were not well parameterized by either the open-ocean Gregg-Henyey
   model or the recently developed MacKinnon-Gregg shelf model. Like its
   application on the New England shelf, the MacKinnon-Gregg model had the
   correct functional dependence on shear and stratification (dissipation
   increasing with increasing shear and increasing stratification),
   however, the magnitude and range of values were too small. The most
   surprising finding was the presence of what we believe to be large,
   high-aspect-ratio, downslope-propagating nonlinear internal
   solitary-like waves of elevation. Upon reaching the canyon rim, these
   waves propagated into deep water and transformed into waves of
   depression. On the shelf south of the canyon, the waves of elevation
   accounted for 20 \% of the observed turbulent kinetic energy
   dissipation. Off the shelf, where the solitary-like waves changed to
   downward displacement, their average dissipation increased 10-fold to
   epsilon = 2.6 x 10(-6) W kg(-1), and accounted for nearly half the
   dissipation in the upper 150 m. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease in Southern Cone
   countries, frequently infests peridomestic structures housing domestic
   animals. A total of 814 T infestans collected from 35 different
   peridomestic sites in rural northwestern Argentina over 1-4 consecutive
   seasons was examined for recent blood meals and nutritional status. Bugs
   from goat or pig corrals had lower qualitative nutritional status and
   mean weight to length ratios (W/L) than those captured in chicken coops.
   Males systematically had lower qualitative nutritional status and W/L
   than females. Using logistic multiple regression, the daily feeding
   rates of T. infestans were significantly associated with season and
   stage but not ecotope, whereas the proportion of well-fed bugs varied
   significantly with all three factors. The seasonal trends in feeding
   rates and nutritional status were consistent with the local availability
   and breeding timing of domestic animals. The observed data fed into an
   empirical model predicted that the probability of flight initiation
   would peak in summer from pig or goat corrals, not chicken coops, and be
   insignificant in all ecotopes in spring and fall. Male T infestans
   outnumbered females as potential fliers. This is the first study
   conducted in well-defined habitat units that shows significant
   heterogeneities in the feeding rates and nutritional status of
   triatomine populations linked to host demographics and management, and
   how these affect flight dispersal potential over seasons. Peridomestic
   bug populations are of great relevance as a source of domestic
   reinfestation and for the elimination of T infestans. (C) 2005 Elsevier

   rate. The cure mechanism for the system studied remained broadly
   autocatalytic regardless of PPSU content, and it became far more
   diffusion controlled at higher PPSU content and lower cure temperatures.

Abstract = {{The paper studies the effects of mould temperature and holding pressure
   on the structure of neat and beta-nucleated isotactic polypropylenes.
   Commercially available isotactic polypropylene was modified with a
   beta-specific nucleator based on
   N,N'-dicyclohexylnaphthalene-2,6-dicarboxamide in the concentration of
   0.03 wt.\%. From both the original material (alpha-iPP) and the
   beta-nucleated material (beta-iPP), dog bone-shaped test specimens were
   injection-moulded, using two sets of processing parameters. In the T-set
   the mould temperature was varied within the range of 40-120 degrees C in
   10 degrees C steps, while in the beta-set the holding pressure was
   changed from 5 to 13 MPa in 1 MPa steps. Other processing parameters
   were kept on the same level. Polarized-light microscopy showed a strong
   effect of mould temperature on the morphology of alpha-iPP specimens;
   the skin thinned out and the spherulite size increased with mould
   temperature rise. On the other hand, in the case of alpha-iPP only the
   skin thickness was correspondingly affected, while the spherulite size
   remained virtually constant, independent of the mould temperature
   changes. At the same structure level, both alpha-iPP and beta-iPP
   specimens were insensitive to holding pressure variations. Polymorphic
   composition derived from wide-angle X-ray scattering displayed similar
   range of changes induced by variations of the processing parameters for
   both materials. The increase of mould temperature positively influenced
   the crystallinity and the P-form content, particularly in the skin of
   specimens. On the contrary, higher holding pressure depressed the
   crystallinity proportionally within the bulk of specimens. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Newly moulted females of the insect Oncopeltus fasciatus were exposed to
   cadmium (Cd) dissolved in the drinking water (50-400 mg l(-1) Cd) for 5
   days. Cd exposure delayed ovarian maturation and inhibited egg
   production. Exposure to Cd, moreover, decreased hemolymph levels of the
   two major vitellogenin polypeptides of O. fasciatus, VG1 and VG2, in a
   concentration-dependent way, probably by a reduction in their synthesis.
   The ovarian levels of VG1 and VG2 were also decreased in Cd-exposed
   females. It was next investigated whether Cd effects might be a
   consequence of the endocrine disruption of vitellogenin synthesis, which
   is controlled by juvenile hormone (JH). JH replacement therapy did not
   restore VG1 or VG2 levels in Cd-exposed females, but did so in starved
   females. Our results do not therefore support a disturbance of JH
   production or a reduction in feeding as the cause of the reduced
   vitellogenin polypeptide levels, but rather point to the site of action
   of JH, the JH receptor, as the target of Cd effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{GRO J1655-40, a well known black hole candidate, showed renewed X-ray
   activity in March 2005 after being dormant for almost eight years. It
   showed very prominent quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO). We analysed the
   data of two observations in this Rapid Communication, one taken on March
   2nd, 2005 and the other. taken on the March 11th, 2005. On March 2nd,
   2005, the shock was weak and the QPO was seen in roughly all energies.
   On March 11th, 2005, the power density spectra showed that
   quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were exhibited in harder X-rays. On
   the first day, the QPO was seen at 0.13 Hz and on the second day, the
   QPO was seen at similar to 6.5 Hz with a spectral break at similar to
   0.1 Hz. We analysed the QPOs for the period 25th February 2005 to 12th
   of March, 2005 and showed that the frequency of QPO increased
   monotonically from 0.088 Hz to 15.01 Hz. This agrees well if the
   oscillating shock is assumed to propagate with a constant velocity. On
   several days, we also noticed the presence of very high frequency QPOs
   and for the first time, we detected QPOs in the 600 - 700 Hz range, the
   highest frequency range so far reported for any black hole candidate.}},

Abstract = {{Tetraclita japonica is a common barnacle in Hong Kong, occupying a wide
   vertical zonation on exposed to semi-exposed shores. The length of the
   exopodite of cirri IV-VI of T. japonica varied with different degrees of
   wave exposure and tidal levels. Barnacles on exposed shores had shorter
   cirri than those on semi-exposed ones. Barnacles at the low intertidal
   also had shorter cirri than those at the high intertidal zone.
   Differences in desiccation and heat stress, the length of the immersion
   period for feeding, and predation pressure along the tidal gradient may
   be additional factors affecting the cirral length of T. japonica.
   Compared with Balanus glandula in temperate waters, the proportional
   difference in the cirral length of T. japonica between wave-extreme
   locations is much smaller (4\%) than that of B. glandula (80\%).
   Differing from B. glandula, which actively beat their cirri to feed, T.
   japonica exhibits prolonged extension of the cirri for feeding, which
   may not favour long cirri even on semi-exposed shores. Barnacles with
   different cirral activities, therefore, appear to have different degrees
   of cirral responses to environmental stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of economic homogeneity in regional science is based on two
   very different notions: composition and similarity. In the case of the

   results of studies that use measures of economic homogeneity are likely
   to be sensitive to the conceptual basis of the specific measure. In
   order to overcome this problem, a portfolio-theoretic measure of
   economic homogeneity with some attractive properties is presented. It is
   naturally decomposable into two components reflecting each of these
   notions and easy to construct using widely available data. Using this
   measure, patterns of homogeneity for the states of the US are
   illustrated and discussed, and hypotheses about the relationship between
   homogeneity and economic instability are tested.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of NOx precursors ( mainly HCN and NH3) from the pyrolysis

   revealed that demineralization by acid washing drastically decreases
   nitrogen conversion to NH3 at a fast heating rate and at a slow heating
   rate, but for HCN, its formation is different at fast heating and slow
   heating rates. The yield of HCN from demineralized coal is slightly
   lower than that from raw coal at a fast heating rate and it is the
   reverse at a slow heating rate. On the other hand, the pyrolysis
   experiments data of demineralized coal and raw coal added with ash from
   Pingshuo coal combustion also indicated that minerals in coal play an
   important role in gaseous-N formation, but the reaction mechanism is
   different for raw coal and demineralized coal.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of efficiently packing steel products, known as
   coils, into special containers, called cassettes for shipping. The
   objective is to minimize the number of cassettes used for packing all
   the given coils where each cassette has capacity limits on both total
   payload weight and size. We model this problem as a two-dimensional
   vector packing problem and propose a heuristic. We also analyze the
   worst-case performance of the proposed algorithm under a special
   condition which, in fact, holds for the particular real-world case that
   we handled. Our computational experiment with real production data shows
   that the proposed algorithm performs quite satisfactorily in practice.

Abstract = {{Nitrogen-doped Cr-C:H/N films were synthesized by using a cathodic-arc
   activated deposition process. Chromium plasma with intensive ion
   energies catalyzes the decomposition of hydrocarbon gas (C2H2), and
   results in the deposition of amorphous carbon films. Nitrogen was
   introduced to form nitrogen-containing Cr-C:H/N films, which contained a
   mixture of sp(2) and sp(3) carbon bonds. The deposited carbon films
   consist of nanocomposite Cr-C:H/N films on top of a graded chromium
   nitride interlayer. It has been found that the structural and electrical
   properties of the films were correlated as a function of nitrogen
   doping. The nature of the heterojunction is confirmed by the spreading
   resistance characteristics of the Cr-C:H/N film/Si junction showing a
   behavior dependant on the nitrogen doping induced structure changes.
   With increasing nitrogen concentration, the increasing pi states of
   sp(2) hybridization results in a more pronounced enhancement of
   conductivity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new wind-wave prediction model, referred to as the North Atlantic
   hurricane (NAH) wave model, has been developed at the National Centers
   for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to produce forecasts of
   hurricane-generated waves during the Atlantic hurricane season. A
   detailed description of this model and a comparison of its performance
   against the operational western North Atlantic (WNA) wave model during
   Hurricanes Isidore and Lili, in 2002, are presented. The NAH and WNA
   models are identical in their physics and numerics. The NAH model uses a
   wind field obtained by blending data from NCEP's operational Global
   Forecast System (GFS) with those from a higher-resolution hurricane
   prediction model, whereas the WNA wave model uses winds provided
   exclusively by the GFS. Relative biases of the order of 10\% in the
   prediction of maximum wave heights up to 48 h in advance, indicate that
   the use of higher-resolution winds in the NAH model provides a
   successful framework for predicting extreme sea states generated by a
   hurricane. Consequently, the NAH model has been made operational at NCEP
   for use during the Atlantic hurricane season.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Objective: Tacrolimus ointment is approved for the treatment
   of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). We sought to evaluate the
   efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment 0.03 \% compared with vehicle
   in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD.
   Methods. Two identically designed, independent, randomized,
   double-blind, 6-week studies-one pediatric and one adult-in patients
   with mild to moderate AD were conducted. Combined data from 617 patients
   were used in the analysis. The primary efficacy end point was percentage
   of patients with treatment success (defined as ``clear{''} or ``almost
   clear{''} on the Investigator's Global AD Assessment) at end of study.
   Results. As early as day 4, treatment success occurred in 17.7 \% of
   patients treated with tacrolimus compared with 9.8 \% of patients
   treated with vehicle (P = .003), and by study end had increased to 49.7
   \% for tacrolimus versus 29.0 \% for vehicle (P < .0001). Tacrolimus was
   associated with significantly less application site pruritus than
   vehicle (29.0 \% vs 37.5 \%; P = .03). There was no difference between
   tacrolimus and vehicle in the incidence of application site skin burning
   and stinging.
   Conclusion: Tacrolimus ointment 0.03 \% is effective and safe for the
   management of mild to moderate AD in both adult and pediatric patients,
   and has a rapid onset of action.}},

Abstract = {{An unconfined aquifer was instrumented with monitoring wells over a
   surface area of about 100 m x 100 m. The aquifer is a sand deposit
   overlying a thick nonfissured layer of Champlain Sea clay. The paper
   presents the results of a pumping test at a constant flow rate. None of
   the curves of drawdown versus time presented the S shape of current
   theories; however, all drawdowns indicated that the aquifer was
   homogeneous. The values for the specific yield were too low and varied
   with distance and time instead of being constant. The theories for
   steady and unsteady states provided different values for the saturated
   hydraulic conductivity. To understand the field behavior that differs
   from theoretical predictions, the pumping test conditions were modeled
   numerically using a finite element method. The transmissivity was
   derived from the Dupuit equation, and different curves for capillary
   retention and unsaturated permeability were examined. The numerical
   drawdowns agree with the experimental drawdowns. Several numerical
   models were investigated. All of them solved the inverse problem
   correctly for steady-state conditions and fairly well for transient
   conditions with highly nonlinear characteristic functions. The best
   solution to the transient problem was obtained using trial and error, by
   considering how the drawdown curves might be modified due to anisotropy
   and stratification. According to these field tests and the numerical
   analysis, the S shape is not the rule, and a different shape can be
   perfectly normal due to the complexity of unsaturated flow.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) generally
   have an unfavorable clinical course and are under-represented in
   clinical trials. The aim of this study was to analyze the prognosis and
   treatment outcome of elderly AML patients.
   Patients and methods: We studied 205 AML patients aged 65 years or older
   at our hospital. Prior to study initiation, we designated 13 variables
   to be analyzed for their impact on complete remission (CR) rate and
   overall survival (OS).
   Results: Induction regimen (standard chemotherapy) and good performance
   status (PS) (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS 0-1) independently
   influenced the achievement of CR. Multivariate analysis also determined
   five poor prognostic factors for OS: poor PS (score 2-4), presence of
   comorbidities, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level (>= 2x upper
   normal limit), extreme leukocytosis (>= 100 x 10(9)/l) and marked
   thrombocytopenia (<= 20 x 10(9)/l). Age was not an independent
   contributing factor in terms of either CR attainment or OS duration.
   Low-risk patients, who possessed one or less non-leukocytosis poor
   prognostic factor, had significantly longer disease-free survival and OS
   than their high-risk counterparts.
   Conclusions: Elderly AML patients should be fisk-stratified at
   diagnosis. Anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy would be the best
   therapeutic option for such patients.}},

Abstract = {{The YIP1 family comprises an evolutionarily conserved group of membrane
   proteins, which share the ability to bind di-prenylated Rab proteins.
   The biochemical capability of YIP1 family proteins suggests a possible
   role in the cycle of physical localization of Rab proteins between their
   cognate membranes and the cytosol. YIP1 is essential for viability in
   yeast and a deletion of YIP1 can be rescued with the human homologue
   YIP1A. We have made use of this evolutionary conservation of function to
   generate a series of mutant alleles of YIP1 to investigate the
   biological role of Yip1p. our findings indicate evidence for the
   participation of Yip1p in both Rab and COPII protein function; at
   present, we are not able to distinguish between the models that these

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Immune rejection can lead to the failure of human embryonic
   stem cell (hES cell) transplantation. One approach to address the
   problem is to establish hES cell line banks. Due to the limited source
   of human embryos and to ethical reasons, the hES cell lines are not
   readily available. This study was undertaken to determine whether
   discarded day 3 embryos with low morphological scores could develop into
   blastocysts and produce hES cell lines. METHODS: A total of 130 day 3
   embryos with low morphological scores were cultured to blastocyst stage,
   and inner cell masses (ICM) were isolated by immunosurgery. Colonies
   derived from the ICM were passaged every 4-7 days and evaluated for cell
   surface markers, differentiation potentials and karyotypes. RESULTS: A
   total of 19 blastocysts were obtained from 130 embryos (quality score <
   16), which resulted in the formation of 10 ICM, and two cell lines. Both
   cell lines satisfied the criteria that characterize pluripotent hES
   cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a subset with poor quality
   day 3 embryos judged on the basis of morphological assessment can form
   blastocysts and give rise to hES cell lines.}},

Abstract = {{By integrating factor analysis (FA) with Kalman filter (KF), a novel

   the calibration model of KF. In this way, the inherent limitation of KF,
   in which calibration modeling highly relies on the pure spectra of all
   the components in the multicomponent system, has been overcome. Computer
   simulatin indicates that the results obtained by the proposed algorithm
   are accurate. A typical example of three-lomponent drug including
   aminopyrine, caffein and phenacetin has been used to verify the
   effectiveness of algorithms. Compared with what obtained by KF, the
   total mean relative error obtained by the proposed algorithm decreases

Abstract = {{A Clostridium butyricum strain, isolated from hydrogen-producing sewage
   sludge, was examined for its ability to produce H-2 from sucrose-based
   medium under different medium composition, pH, and carbon substrate
   concentration. The strain, designated as C butyricum CGS5, grew and
   produced hydrogen efficiently on iron-containing medium. Hydrogen
   started to evolve when cell growth entered mid-exponential phase and
   reached maximum production rate at the stationary phase. The optimal
   hydrogen production (5.31) and hydrogen yield (2.78 mol H-2/mol sucrose)
   were obtained at an initial sucrose concentration of 20 g COD/l (17.8
   g/l) and a pH of 5.5. However, the CGS5 strain attained its highest
   hydrogen production rate (209ml/h/l) under a medium pH of 6.0. In
   comparison with pH 5.5, operation at pH 6.0 and 6.5 obtained higher cell
   growth rate and cell yield, but resulted in lower total hydrogen
   production and hydrogen yield. This is most likely due to rapid
   conversion of the carbon source into biomass, reducing the formation of
   hydrogen. Neither hydrogen production nor cell growth was detected when
   the strain was cultivated at pH 5.0. A sucrose concentration of 20 g
   CODA gave the best hydrogen fermentation performance, whereas cell
   growth rate and hydrogen production rate both decreased when sucrose
   concentration was elevated to 30g CODA, suggesting that substrate
   inhibition may occur. (c) 2004 International Association for Hydrogen

Abstract = {{Objective and design: Heat shock (HS) treatment (42 degrees C for 15
   min) and the expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) protect against
   angiotensin (Ang) II-induced inflammation in aorta and heart by
   suppressing the activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor
   NF-kappa B. In this study we examined pro-inflammatory transcription
   factors SP-1, AP-1 and an anti-inflammatory cytokine transcriptional
   repressor, Oct-1, DNA-binding activities after chronic Ang II infusion
   and the effect of HS treatment on these pathways in heart.
   Methods: HS treatment was administered 24 hr before initiation of Ang II
   infusion to male Sprague-Dawley rats. Systolic blood pressure was
   measured by tail-cuff plethysmography, expression of heat shock proteins
   was monitored by Western analysis and DNA-binding activities of SP-1,
   AP-1 and Oct-1 were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
   Results: Ang II infusion induced a progressive increase in systolic
   blood pressure that was suppressed by the heat shock treatment.
   Following heat shock treatment, Hsp70 and Hsp27 were expressed at
   elevated levels. The Ang II-induced activation of SP-1 and AP-1 were
   significantly suppressed by HS treatment. In addition, HS increased
   Oct-1 activity that was suppressed by Ang II infusion.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that heat shock suppresses inflammation
   by differentially regulating pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cell
   signaling pathways.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{In a typical content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system, target images
   (images in the database) are sorted by feature similarities with respect
   to the query. Similarities among target images are usually ignored. This
   paper introduces a new technique, cluster-based retrieval of images by
   unsupervised learning (CLUE), for improving user interaction with image
   retrieval systems by fully exploiting the similarity information. CLUE
   retrieves image clusters by applying a graph-theoretic clustering
   algorithm to a collection of images in the vicinity of the query.
   Clustering in CLUE is dynamic. In particular, clusters formed depend on
   which images are retrieved in response to the query. CLUE can be
   combined with any real-valued symmetric similarity measure (metric or
   nonmetric). Thus, it may be embedded in many current CBIR systems,
   including relevance feedback systems. The performance of an experimental
   image retrieval system using CLUE is evaluated on a database of around
   60,000 images from COREL. Empirical results demonstrate improved
   performance compared with a CBIR system using the same image similarity
   measure. In addition, results on images returned by Google's Image
   Search reveal the potential of applying CLUE to real-world image data
   and integrating CLUE as a part of the interface for keyword-based image
   retrieval systems.}},

Abstract = {{Noroviruses (Norwalk-like viruses) are recognized as major causes of
   acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis
   are often associated with consumption of oysters. In this study, oysters
   imported into Hong Kong from 11 countries over a 3-year period were
   screened by RT-PCR. Overall, 53 out of 507 (10.5\%) samples were
   positive for norovirus-RNA, and a wide variety of strains were found.
   Two novel genetic clusters were detected, which could indicate novel
   human or animal norovirus strains. However, whether these two new
   clusters are of human or animal origin is not known. Thirteen outbreaks,
   in which oysters were implicated as the source of infection were
   investigated: Norovirus RNA sequences could be detected in oysters from
   six outbreaks, but only in one outbreak the strains isolated from
   patients and oysters matched (> 98\% homology). Therefore, RT-PCR was of
   use in detecting norovirus contamination of oysters implicated in an
   outbreak, but was less useful in demonstrating an actual molecular
   epidemiological link with human cases. It was shown that contamination
   by noroviruses could be demonstrated in oysters worldwide, and therefore
   oysters may serve as an important vehicle for introducing novel
   norovirus strains. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Here we apply a combination of phylogeographic and historical
   demographic analyses to the study of mtDNA sequence variation within the
   Blue-crowned Manakin (Lepidothrix coronata), a widespread Neotropical
   bird. A high degree of phylogeographic structure allowed us to
   demonstrate that several vicariant events, including Andean uplift, the
   formation of riverine barriers, and climatically induced vegetational
   shifts, as well as a non-vicariant process, range expansion, have all
   acted, at varying spatial and temporal scales, to influence genetic
   structure within L. coronata, suggesting that current historical
   hypotheses of the origin of Neotropical avian diversity that focus on
   single vicariant mechanisms may be overly simplistic. Our data also
   support an origin (> 2 mybp) that is substantially older than the late
   Pleistocene for the genetic structure within this species and indicate
   that phylogeographic patterns within the species are not concordant with
   plumage-based subspecific taxonomy. These data add to a growing body of
   evidence suggesting that the origin of several Neotropical avian species
   may have occurred in the mid-Pliocene, thus, geological arguments
   surrounding putative Pleistocene vicariant events, while interesting in
   their own right, may have little relevance to Neotropical avian
   diversification at the species level. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   internalization of racism, and what interracial relationships represent
   to Black women and signify about Black women's worth. The impact of

Abstract = {{As cardiac involvement by malignant lymphoma (ML) is relatively uncommon
   and antemortem diagnosis is difficult, details of this condition remain
   to be elucidated. To clarify clinicopathologic features of cardiac
   lymphoma (CL), 25 autopsy cases were studied. Each was rediagnosed
   according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, and
   clinicopathologic characteristics were investigated by tumor phenotype.
   The study subjects were 13 males and 12 females with a mean age of 53.4
   years. All cases were secondary CL and were not diagnosed as CL before
   death; 14 cases (56\%) were of B-cell and 11 (44\%) of T-cell (including
   natural killer cell) phenotype. Nasal and nasal-type natural
   killer/T-cell lymphomas (NKTLs) accounted for five (20\%). Cardiac
   manifestation was evident in eight (32\%), with hematogenous
   infiltration as the most common pattern of tumor spread. Some B-cell CLs
   (n=3) were complicated by cardiac tamponade and heart failure (HF), and
   T-cell CLs (n=5), including three nasal NKTLs, also featured arrhythmia
   and sudden death. The incidence of T-cell phenotype was significantly
   elevated for CLs (p < 0.05), especially for CLs with cardiac
   manifestation (p < 0.01), compared with that for MLs in general. Our
   results indicate that T-cell lymphomas, compared with B-cell lymphomas,
   invade the heart more frequently and aggressively and are associated
   with a variety of cardiac manifestations. Where cardiac involvement is
   suspected, aggressive diagnostic procedures are warranted, especially
   with MLs having a T-cell phenotype. In cases of nasal NKTL, particular
   attention is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{There are 100 million cases of dengue infection, 500,000 cases of dengue
   hemorrhagic fever, and 25,000 deaths annually due to dengue worldwide.
   Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common type of severe hemorrhage
   in dengue fever. However, there are no reports about the clinical
   applications of endoscopic therapy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding
   (UGI) in dengue patients. From June 17, 2002 to January 30, 2003, 1,156
   patients with confirmed dengue virus infection were treated at Kaohsiung
   Chang Gang Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. We analyzed those patients who
   had received endoscopic therapy for UGI. The characteristic endoscopic
   findings, therapeutic courses, and amount of blood component transfused
   were collected from their charts for statistical analysis. Among the
   1,156 dengue patients, 97 (8.4\%) had complications of UGI bleeding
   during hospitalization. The endoscopic findings included hemorrhagic
   (and/or erosive) gastritis in 67\% of the patients, gastric ulcer in
   57.7\%, duodenal ulcer in 26.8\%, and esophageal ulcer in 3.1\%. Of the
   73 patients with peptic ulcer, 42 (57.5\%) met the endoscopic criteria
   (recent hemorrhage) for endoscopic hemostasis therapy. Peptic ulcer
   patients with recent hemorrhage required more transfusions with packed
   red blood cells (P = 0.002) and fresh frozen plasma (P = 0.05) than
   those without recent hemorrhage. Among these 42 patients with recent
   hemorrhage, endoscopic injection therapy was conducted in 15 patients
   (group A). The other 27 patients (group 13) did not receive endoscopic
   therapy. After endoscopy, patients in group A required more transfusions
   with packed red blood cells (P = 0.03) and fresh frozen plasma (P =
   0.014) than did patients in group B. There were no significant
   differences between groups A and B in duration of hospital stay and
   amounts of transfused platelet concentrate after endoscopy. Medical
   treatment with blood transfusion is the mainstay of management of UGI
   bleeding in dengue patients. Patients having peptic ulcer with recent
   hemorrhage require more transfusions with packed red blood cells and
   fresh frozen plasma for management of UGI bleeding than those without
   recent hemorrhage. However, when peptic ulcer with recent hemorrhage is
   encountered during the endoscopic procedure, endoscopic injection
   therapy is not an effective adjuvant treatment of hemostasis in dengue
   patients with UGI bleeding.}},

   unstable only if the wind is westerly. At the upper troposphere, in
   order to be unstable the wind must be easterly, and the system is stable
   when the perturbation wind is westerly. Next, we calculated the linear
   case with a background wind in the zonal direction. This is identical to
   the case analyzed by Neelin et al. (1987). We also obtained identical
   results, namely the system is stable if the background wind is assumed
   westerly and unstable if the background wind is assumed easterly.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the unavoidable nonbiological variations accompanying many
   experiments, it is imperative to consider a way of unravelling the
   functional interaction structure of a cellular network (e.g. signalling
   cascades or gene networks) by using the qualitative information of
   time-series experimental data instead of computation through the
   measured absolute values. In this spirit, we propose a very simple but
   effective method of identifying the functional interaction structure of
   a cellular network based on temporal ascending or descending slope
   information from given time-series measurements. From this method, we
   can gain insight into the acceptable measurement error ranges in order
   to estimate the correct functional interaction structure and we can also
   find guidance for a new experimental design to complement the
   insufficient information of a given experimental dataset. We developed
   experimental sign equations, making use of the temporal slope sign
   information from time-series experimental data, without a specific
   assumption on parameter perturbations for each network node. Based on
   these equations, we further describe the available specific information
   from each part of experimental data in detail and show the functional
   interaction structure obtained by integrating such information. In this
   procedure, we use only simple algebra on sign changes without
   complicated computations on the measured absolute values of the
   experimental data. The result is, however, verified through rigorous
   mathematical definitions and proofs. The present method provides us with
   information about the acceptable measurement error ranges for correct
   estimation of the functional interaction structure and it further leads
   to a new experimental design to complement the given experimental data
   by informing us about additional specific sampling points to be chosen
   for further required information.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a process modeling and analysis technique for
   managing complex design projects using advanced simulation. The model
   computes the probability distribution of lead time in a stochastic,
   resource-constrained project network where iterations take place among
   sequential, parallel, and overlapped tasks. The model uses the design
   structure matrix representation to capture the information flows between
   tasks. We use a simulation-based analysis to account for many realistic
   aspects of design process behavior which were not possible in previous
   analytical models. We propose a heuristic for the stochastic,
   resource-constrained project scheduling problem in an iterative project
   network. The model can be used for better project planning and control
   by. identifying leverage points for process improvements, and for
   evaluating alternative planning and execution strategies. An industrial
   example is provided to illustrate the utility of the model.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic model for failures in biological organisms is proposed and

   the presence of noise. Revealed is the characteristic time evolution
   that the system tends to resist the stress longer than the system
   without healing, followed by sudden breakdown with some fraction of
   cells surviving. When the noise is weak, the critical stress beyond
   which the system breaks down increases rapidly as the healing parameter
   is raised from zero, indicative of the importance of healing in

Abstract = {{Asthma is a chronic disorder that can place considerable restrictions on

   Inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most effective controller therapy.
   The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of inhaled GCs on
   quality of life in patients with moderate to severe asthma. Patients
   completed the asthma quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ) and pulmonary
   function test at baseline and after 4 Wks treatment of GCs. We enrolled
   60 patients who had reversibility in FEV1 after 200 mu g of albuterol of
   15\% or more and/or positive methacholine provocation test, and initial
   FEV1\% predicted less than 80\%. All patients received inhaled GiCs
   (fluticasone propionate 1,000 mu g/ day) for 4 Wks. The score of AQLQ
   was significantly improved following inhaled GiCs (overall 51.9 +/- 14.3
   vs. 67.5 +/- 12.1, p < 0.05). The change from day 1 to day 28 in FEV1,
   following inhaled GiCs was diversely ranged from -21.0\% to 126.8\%. The
   improvement of score of AQLQ was not different between at baseline and
   after treatment of GCs according to asthma severity and GCs
   responsiveness. Quality of life was improved after inhaled GCs
   regardless of asthma severity and GCs responsiveness in patients with

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the
   effectiveness of preconditioning molecular adsorbent recirculating
   system (MARS) treatment on patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure
   (AoCLF), who were awaiting living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).
   Patients and methods: Between January and December 2001, 10 consecutive
   AoCLF patients (with progressive hyperbilirubinemia (> 20 mg/dl) and
   hepatic encephalopathy grade >= 2) were studied. MARS was used in eight
   of these patients who were evaluated for LDLT during 2001. Three AoCLF
   patients who received LDLT before clinical use of MARS were used as
   historical controls. Results: Because of a shortage of donors, only five
   out of 10 patients considered for LDLT could receive transplants. Three
   patients were treated with MARS for 8 h the day before receiving LDLT,
   and all three survived. The remaining two patients who received
   transplants, and who were not pretreated with MARS, died from sepsis and
   multi-organ failure within 2 weeks. Four of the patients who did not
   receive transplants because of donor shortage died despite 1 or 3 MARS
   treatments, however bilirubin levels and grade of encephalopathy were
   significantly reduced in these patients. Conclusions: Results of this
   small pilot study suggest that MARS, by reducing the severity of
   jaundice and encephalopathy, might be effective as a bridging option in
   AoCLF patients awaiting LDLT.}},

   nitric acid-to-particulate nitrate ratio, which is determined mainly by
   ambient temperature. Accurate estimation of nitrate volatilization
   requires a detailed thermodynamic model and comprehensive chemical
   measurements. For the 14-month average of PM2.5 acquired on
   Teflon-membrane filters, measured PM2.5 mass was 8-16\% lower than

Abstract = {{Exponentially growing cells of Zymomonas mobilis normally exhibit a lag
   period of up to 3 It when they are transferred from a liquid medium
   containing 2\% glucose to a liquid medium containing 10\% glucose. A
   mutant of Z. mobilis (CU1) exhibited a lag period of more than 20 h when
   it was grown under the same conditions, whereas it failed to grow on a
   solid medium containing 10\% glucose. The glucose-defective phenotype of
   mutant CU1 was due to a spontaneous insertion in a putative gene (ORF4)
   identified as part of an operon (glc) which includes three additional
   putative genes (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3) with no obvious involvement in the
   glucose tolerance mechanism. The common promoter controlling glc operon
   transcription, designated P-glc, was found to be osmoregulated and
   stimulated by the putative product of OPF4 in an autoregulated fashion,
   as indicated by expression of the gfp reporter gene. Additionally,
   reverse transcriptase PCR analysis showed that the gene cluster produces
   a single mRNA, which verified the operon organization of this
   transcription unit. Further transcriptional analysis demonstrated that
   glc operon expression is regulated by the concentration of glucose,
   which supported the hypothesis that this operon is directly involved in
   the uncharacterized glucose tolerance mechanism of Z. mobilis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the architecture of the Guide Project, a proposal
   for innovation of Health Information Systems, putting together medical
   and organizational issues through the Separation of Concerns paradigm.
   In particular, we focus on one building block of the architecture: the
   Guideline Management System handling the whole life cycle of
   computerized Clinical Practice Guidelines. The communication between the
   Guideline Management System and the other components of the project
   architecture is message-based, according to specific contracts that
   allow an easy integration of the components developed by different
   parties and, in particular, with legacy systems (i.e. existing
   electronic patient records). In turn, the Guideline Management System
   components are organized in a distributed architecture: an editor to
   formalize guidelines, a repository to store and publish them, an
   enactment system to implement guidelines instances in a multi-user
   environment and a reporting system able to completely trace any
   individual physician's guideline-based decision process. The repository
   is organized in different levels that can be international, national,
   regional, down to the specific health care organization, according to
   the healthcare delivery policy of a country. Different organizations can
   get Clinical Practice Guidelines from the repository, adapt and
   introduce them in clinical practice. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Although the current recommendation is to measure
   radiographic joint space width (JSW) to assess structural change in
   osteoarthritis (OA), there is increasing interest in direct measurement
   of cartilage volume from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We performed
   a longitudinal study to compare change in both JSW and articular
   cartilage volume in subjects with symptomatic knee OA.
   Methods: JSW was measured in 28 subjects with knee OA (57\% females,
   mean age 62.8 +/- 9.8 years) who had standing radiographs in full
   extension, where both radiographs had satisfactory alignment. Each
   subject had femoral, tibial and combined femoral and tibial cartilage
   volumes determined from T1-weighted fat saturated sagittal knee MRI. All
   subjects had a repeat of the knee radiograph and MRI 1.96 +/- 0.4 years
   later.
   Results: At baseline there was a moderate, but statistically
   significant, correlation between JSW and femoral and tibial cartilage
   volumes in the medial tibiofemoral joint, which was strengthened by
   adjusting for medial tibial bone size (R=0.58-0.66, P=0.001). Although
   we observed a reduction in JSW and femoral and tibial cartilage volumes
   over the study period, there was no significant association between
   reduction in JSW and cartilage volume (R<0.13). There was a trend
   towards a significant association between change in medial tibiofemoral
   cartilage volume and joint replacement at 4 years (OR=9.0, P=0.07) but
   not change in medial tibiofemoral JSW (OR=1.1, P=0.92).
   Conclusions: Although there was a modest correlation between cartilage
   volume and JSW in the medial tibiofemoral compartment, there was no
   correlation between longitudinal change in these measures. Change in
   cartilage volume appears to be a better predictor of joint replacement.
   Further work in larger samples over a longer period of time will be
   needed to confirm these findings. (C) 2005 OsteoArthritis Research

Abstract = {{Objective - The participation of 5- lipoxygenase ( 5- LO) in the
   development of atherosclerosis has been suggested by recent studies.
   However, a role for 5- LO as a modulator of atherosclerotic plaque
   instability has not been previously reported in humans. Thus, the aims
   of this study was to analyze the expression of 5- LO in human carotid
   plaques and to investigate the mechanism by which this enzyme could lead
   to plaque instability and rupture.
   Methods and Results - We obtained atherosclerotic plaques from 60
   patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. We divided the plaques into
   symptomatic and symptomatic according to clinical evidence of plaque
   instability. Clinical evidence of plaque instability was provided by the
   assessment of recent ischemic symptoms attributable to the stenosis and
   by the presence of ipsilateral cerebral lesion( s) determined by
   computed tomography. Plaques were analyzed for CD68 + macrophages, CD3 +
   T cells, alpha- actin + smooth muscle cells, 5- LO, cyclooxygenase 2,
   matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)- 2, and MMP- 9 by immunohistochemical,
   immunoblotting, and densitometric analyses. MMP activity was assessed by
   zymography. Leukotriene ( LT) B-4 and collagen were quantified by ELISA
   and Sirius red polarization, respectively. The percentage of macrophage-
   rich and T- cell - rich areas was larger in symptomatic compared with
   asymptomatic patients ( 25 +/- 6\% versus 8 +/- 4\%, P < 0.0001, and 74
   +/- 17 versus 18 +/- 4 cell/ mm(2), P < 0.003). 5- LO expression was
   higher in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic plaques ( 24 +/- 4\%
   versus 6 +/- 3\%, P < 0.0001) and was associated with increased MMP- 2
   and MMP- 9 expression ( 27 +/- 4\% versus 7 +/- 3\%, P < 0.0001, and 29
   +/- 5\% versus 8 +/- 2\%, P < 0.0001) and activity and with decreased
   collagen content ( 6.9 +/- 2.4\% versus 17.8 +/- 3.1\%, P < 0.01).
   Immunofluorescence showed that 5- LO and MMPs colocalize in activated
   macrophages. Notably, higher 5- LO in symptomatic plaques correlated
   with increased LTB4 production ( 18.15 +/- 3.56 versus 11.27 +/- 3.04
   ng/ g tissue, P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions - The expression of 5- LO is elevated in symptomatic
   compared with asymptomatic plaques and is associated with acute ischemic
   syndromes, possibly through the generation of LTB4, subsequent MMP
   biosynthesis, and plaque rupture.}},

Abstract = {{The authors argue that the fragmentary model of consciousness implied in
   the term `self-deception' has provided the chief metaphor for explaining
   the apparent discrepancies that can arise between the evaluation of a

   observer. Though self-deception models have explained these
   discrepancies in terms of both a dualistic opaque consciousness and in
   terms of cognitive and affective processes, all of these accounts seem
   to rest on the same essential fragmentation of the psyche. The authors
   argue that a relational model of consciousness, one that claims the
   indissolubility of cognition and affect, object and perception, and of
   past, present, and future can account for the apparent discrepancies
   involved in the paradigmatic cases of self-deception in a more

Abstract = {{The breakpoint cluster region protein, BCR, has protein kinase activity
   that can auto- and trans-phosphorylate serine, threonine and tyrosine
   residues. BCR has been implicated in chronic myelogenous leukaemia as
   well as important signalling pathways, and as such its interaction with
   14-3-3 is of major interest. 14-3-3 tau and zeta isoforms have been
   shown previously to be phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by BCR kinase
   on serine and threonine residue(s) but site(s) were not determined.
   Phosphorylation of 14-3-3 isoforms at distinct sites is an important
   mode of regulation that negatively affects interaction with Raf kinase
   and Bax, and potentially influences the dimerization of 14-3-3. In this
   study we have further characterized the BCR-14-3-3 interaction and have
   identified the site phosphorylated by BCR. We show here that BCR
   interacts with at least five isoforms of 14-3-3 in vivo and
   phosphorylates 14-3-3 tau on Ser233 and to a lesser extent 14-3-3 zeta
   on Thr233. We have previously shown that these two isoforms are also
   phosphorylated at this site by casein kinase 1, which, in contrast to
   BCR, preferentially phosphorylates 14-3-3 zeta.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently the only available antibiotic eardrops for treatment of

   Australia, no fluoroquinolone topical agent is approved for use with
   tympanic membrane perforations, and when used as an `off label' eardrop,
   none is on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This creates an ethical
   dilemma, particularly with best practice management of chronic
   suppurative otitis media in indigenous children. Despite concerns
   regarding resistance issues with ototopical use of systemic antibiotics,
   bacterial resistance has not been documented in major studies. For

Title = {{The effect of calcitriol on fasting urine calcium loss and renal tubular
   reabsorption of calcium in patients with mild renal failure - actions of
   a permissive hormone}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Renal production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is attenuated in
   early renal failure. Renal tubular reabsorption of calcium is diminished
   in moderate renal failure and we wished to see if this were true in the
   early stages and whether supplementary calcitriol would bring about
   correction. We were interested in the idea of
   1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol being a permissive agent, operating
   indirectly. Methods: We measured calcium-related variables, including
   calculated ultrafiltrable serum calcium, before and after calcitriol 0.5
   mu g daily for six days in 34 subjects with stable mild renal failure.
   Results: The mean serum creatinine was 0.21 (+/- 0.08) mmol/l. The mean
   serum Ca++ was normal (1.18 mmol/l) but nine patients had values outside
   the normal range and in six cases, with low-normal serum Ca++ levels,
   there was a diminished tubular reabsorption. In five cases, basal serum
   Ca++ was mildly elevated. The coefficient of variation for serum Ca++
   was 4.4\%. PTH (1-84) levels were mildly elevated and
   1,25-dihydroxycholecalciterol levels low-normal. The urine Ca/Cr,
   representing net bone resorption, was elevated in six cases. After
   calcitriol, the mean serum Ca++ level rose slightly and the coefficient
   of variation decreased to 3.6\%. Changes in Ca++ whether upward or
   downward were accounted for by minor alterations in tubular reabsorption
   and a tendency to less net bone resorption. The initial Ca++ predicted
   (negatively) the magnitude of the correction. Neither the prevailing PTH
   nor the 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels explained any of the
   observed changes. Conclusion: In early renal failure, there may be
   impaired regulation of serum Ca++. Despite elevated PTH, mild
   hypocalcemia may exist in the presence of increased net bone resorption
   relative to GFR. Hypocalcemia was accounted for by reduced renal tubular
   reabsorption of calcium which corrected after calcitriol. Net bone
   resorption tended to fall after calcitriol. Mild hypercalcemia, when
   present, was corrected by a reduction in tubular reabsorption.
   Calcitriol did not have a simple unidirectional effect but instead
   contributed to efficiency of the homeostatic mechanisms controlling the
   serum Ca++ set-point.}},
