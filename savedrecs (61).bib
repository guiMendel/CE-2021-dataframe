Abstract = {{We developed an experimental approach to measure the pulmonary
   interstitial pressure with the micro-puncture technique in in situ lungs
   with an intact pleural space. Experiments were done in anesthetized
   paralyzed rabbits that were oxygenated via an endotracheal tube with
   50\% humidified oxygen and kept in either the supine or the lateral
   position. A small area of an intercostal space was cleared of the
   intercostal muscles down to the endothoracic fascia. Subsequently a
   ``pleural window{''} was opened by stripping the endothoracic fascia
   over a 0.2-cm2 surface and leaving the parietal pleura (approximately
   10-mu-m thick). Direct micropuncture through the pleural window was
   performed with 2- to 3-mu-m-tip pipettes connected to a servo-null
   pressure-measuring system. We recorded pleural liquid pressure and,
   after inserting the pipette tip into the lung, we recorded interstitial
   pressure from subpleural lung tissue. Depth of recording for
   interstitial pressure averaged 263 +/- 122 (SD)-mu-m. We report data
   gathered at 26, 53, and 84\% lung height (relative to the most dependent
   portion of the lung). For the three heights, interstitial pressure was
   -9.8 +/- 3, -10.1 +/- 1.6, and -12.5 +/- 3.7 cmH2O, respectively,
   whereas the corresponding pleural liquid pressure was -3.4 +/- 0.5, -4.4
   +/- 1, and -5.2 +/- 0.3 cmH2O, respectively.}},

   significantly between the two genders, nor did any of the regional

   differed significantly between men and women, which is consistent with

Year = {{1990}},

Abstract = {{The Tuy River basin, located in north-central Venezuela with an annual
   average temperature of 27-degrees-C and precipitation of 140 cm, was
   selected to conduct a geochemical study of bottom sediments, with the
   object of establishing the natural and human influences in the abundance
   and distribution of Fe, Mn, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn and organic carbon. 
   The basin is lithologically divided into two sub-basins, north and
   south.  The north sub-basin drains a low-grade metasedimentary terrain
   with a population density of 800 persons km-2 and approximately 600
   industrial sites, while the south sub-basin in underlain by metavolcanic
   and ultramafic rocks, with a population density of less than 10 persons
   km-2.
   Stream bottom sediment samples (150) were collected during the years of
   1979-1986 in 16 unpolluted sites and 13 polluted sites.  The sediments
   were air dried at room temperature and sieved through a 120 stainless
   steel mesh (125-mu-m).  Samples of grain size smaller than 125-mu-m were
   analysed, the heavy metals being determined by atomic absorption
   spectrometry and the organic carbon (Corg) by dry combustion.
   The higher concentrations of heavy metals and organic carbon found in
   the pristine areas were in the south sub-basin, especially in those
   areas with higher annual precipation and tropical forest.  This
   indicated that the metavolcanic and ultramafic rocks yield higher
   concentrations of heavy metals than the metasedimentary rocks.  It was
   also noted that the higher concentrations of Cr and Ni are associated
   with the ultramafic rocks.  The results obtained from the sediment
   samples collected in the polluted sites showed that the elements Pb, Zn
   and Corg are enriched up to 4 times as a result of all the human
   activities taking place in the basin.  Organic carbon is an excellent
   indicator of domestic wastewater, Pb and Zn are good indicators of the
   automotive traffic and industrial effluents.  The concentrations of each
   heavy metal did not show any significant correlation with grain size
   fractions; however, the concentration of organic carbon did show a
   negative correlation with grain size.  The lithological, climatic and
   vegetation influence in the abundance of heavy metals and organic carbon
   in stream sediments clearly indicates the necessity of establishing
   background levels for the area under study when carrying out studies in
   environmental geochemistry.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of the genetic control of wing form determination of the
   small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus was analyzed by selection
   and crossing experiments.  The selection experiment for brachypterous
   and macropterous forms for 13 generations showed that the wing form is
   under some genetic control.  The crossing experiment showed that the
   wing form polymorphism was not a simple Medelian character but was under
   polygenic control.  The data from the crossing experiment were applied
   to the liability method for the quantitative genetics by Falconer
   (1981).  The analysis suggested that wing form determination was a
   threshold character under polygenic control, and the estimated minimum
   number of loci concerned was 2.07.  The realized heritability estimated
   from the data of selection experiment was 0.36 for macroptery.  On the
   other hand, the heritability in broad sense estimated on the basis of
   the variance of F1 and F2 in crossing experiment was 0.81.}},

   SECRETION FROM CULTURED BOVINE ADRENAL CHROMAFFIN CELLS - POSSIBLE
   RELATION TO ALTERATION IN NA+/K+-PUMP ACTIVITY}},

Abstract = {{1.  Catecholamine secretion evoked by ouabain from cultured bovine
   adrenal chromaffin cells has previously been shown to be markedly
   enhanced by pretreatment of the cells with cytochalasin B (Morita et
   al., 1988).  To elucidate a possible mechanism of this enhancement, the
   stimulatory action of ouabain on Ca2+ influx as well as catecholamine
   secretion was then examined in the cells pretreated with or without
   cytochalasin B.  The effect of cytochalasin B pretreatment on the
   inhibitory action of ouabain on the Na+/K+ pump was also examined by
   measuring Rb-86+ uptake into the cells.
   2.  Pretreatment of the cells with cytochalasin B caused enhancement of
   ouabain-induced catecholamine secretion, and this enhancement was
   accompanied by the elevation of ouabain-stimulated Ca-45(2+) uptake into
   the cells.  The inhibitory action of ouabain on Rb-86+ uptake was
   significantly enhanced by pretreatment of the cells with cytochalasin B
   under the same conditions.
   3.  These results indicate that the enhancement of ouabain-induced
   catecholamine secretion caused by cytochalasin B pretreatment may be due
   to the increase in ouabain-stimulated Ca2+ influx into the cells and,
   furthermore, suggest the possibility that this increase in Ca2+ influx
   may be attributed to the potentiation of the inhibitory action of
   ouabain on the Na+/K+ pump in the adrenal chromaffin cell.  Thus, the
   present study provides an evidence for a possible role of microfilaments
   as one of the intrinsic factors modulating the plasma membrane
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{The highest grade orebody in the Dome mine is a steeply dipping 500 m
   long, 550 m high, and 3.5 m wide banded quartz-fuchsite vein (QFV)
   accompanied by subsidiary veins in the adjacent wall rock. The QFV is
   located in a subvertical zone of carbonatized komatiite near a slate
   unit and is composed of relatively unstrained massive quartz and
   strained ribbon quartz. Fuchsite and chlorite are the main ribbon
   components. Native gold, galena and tellurides are typically associated
   with ribbon quartz, whereas massive quartz is usually low grade.
   The quartz-fuchsite vein system is coeval with the regional penetrative
   deformation. Reverse oblique-slip faulting together with an intricate
   interplay between intermittent variations of the deviatoric stress
   regime and strain refraction due to layer anisotropy explain the overall
   anatomy of the vein system. The regional compressive stress regime and
   the syntectonic wall-rock alteration created the favorable requirements
   for the combined shear and hydraulic fracturing that led to vein
   formation.
   Massive quartz was deposited during prolonged episodes of vein growth,
   whereas ribbon quartz was emplaced in the course of repetitive and brief
   periods of crack-seal vein growth. The systematic association of
   high-grade ore with ribbon quartz suggests a genetic link whereby gold
   deposition is attributed to small pressure drops accompaning the
   crack-seal mechanism of vein growth. Thus, gold was introduced along
   with the bulk of the quartz.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of d.c. electric fields in the TEXTOR edge (inside the
   last closed flux surface) and scrape-off layer (SOL) during auxillary
   heating has been studied using electric probes and spectroscopy.  Peak
   radial and poloidal electric fields in the edge during neutral injection
   are 5 kV/m and 3 kV/m respectively while little effect is seen in the
   SOL.  ICRH alters the radial electric field in the edge, and generates
   large (8 kV/m) fields in the SOL.  These modifications depend
   sensitively on the limiter-antenna configuration.  Large poloidal
   electric field of 2 kV/m are also generated in the SOL, but nearly
   vanish in the edge.  Spectroscopic measurements of changes in poloidal
   rotation in the edge are in agreement with the probe measurements in
   neutral beam heated discharges.  Profile modifications due to the
   electric fields are observed.  The radial particle velocities
   corresponding to the measured poloidal electric fields exceed by many
   times the diffusive velocity, particularly during ICRH, suggesting that
   convective flows may be important.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of nitrogen (N) supply on the relative contributions of
   pre-and post-anthesis net above-ground biomass accumulation and N uptake
   to grain-yield and grain N concentration was examined in four
   contrasting environments in semi-arid tropical Australia. The four
   environments had different radiation and temperature regimes, and
   varying levels of water deficit. The grain-yield achieved under high N
   supply ranged from 156 to 621 g m-2 (on an oven-dry basis).
   In all but the lowest-yielding environment, there was substantial
   biomass accumulation during grain-filling and it increased with N
   application. Only in the lowest-yielding environment was there
   substantial mobilization of pre-anthesis biomass to grain. Biomass
   mobilization was not affected by N application. Nitrogen uptake during
   grain-filling was unresponsive to N application, and was small relative
   to total N uptake during the life-cycle. Mobilization of pre-anthesis N
   to the grain was much more significant. In all but the lowest-yielding
   environment, N mobilization increased with N application.
   Grain-yield under variable N supply and differing environmental
   conditions was not dependent on the proportions of pre-and post-anthesis
   growth. However, grain-yield was proportional to biomass at maturity
   over the entire yield range in this study and variability in biomass
   accounted for 95\% of the variance in grain-yield. Similarly, grain N
   concentration was not related to the proportions of pre-and
   post-anthesis N uptake, but variability in total N uptake accounted for
   92\% of the variance in grain N accumulation. Consequently, there was no
   differential effect of N supply or environmental factors on yield
   physiology that could not be explained by their effect on biomass and N
   uptake.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium salts, often in the form of KCl, have had variable hypotensive
   effects in experimental animals and man.  The chloride anion has
   recently been implicated as the hypertensive agent in salt-sensitive
   hypertension.  We therefore hypothesized that non-chloride salts of
   potassium would have superior hypotensive effects to KCl.  In
   randomized, double-blind fashion, we administered placebo, KCl (75
   mmol/day) or potassium citrate (75 mmol/day) to 24 normotensive adult
   males.  In these subjects, neither KCl nor potassium citrate affected
   blood pressure, despite urinary verification of potassium supplement
   intake.  Thus, in these experimental circumstances, neither potassium
   nor its conjugate anion were of importance in lowering blood pressure.}},

Abstract = {{The poultry industry will remain an important segment of US agriculture
   well into the 21st century.  The consumer demand for poultry products,
   especially poultry meat, can be expected to remain strong.  Today's key
   issues for poultry producers, processors, and retailers will likely
   remain significant through the 1990s:  bacterial infections and
   contamination, other diseases, drug residues, cholesterol and other
   nutritional concerns, and animal welfare.
   In all of these areas, government involvement will continue through
   research and extension.  However, future levels of federal involvement
   are inextricably tied to future levels of appropriate funding for
   research and extension, an uncertain proposition at best.  Although the
   federal establishment is preparing for a future that may be seriously
   constrained by reduced budgets, there are several trends expected to
   continue until the year 2000 and beyond:  1) Environmental issues will
   continue to be a major driving force, if not the single most important
   factor, affecting federal agricultural programs.  2) Research on poultry
   will focus on improving animal nutrition, preventing disease, breeding
   for desirable nutritional characteristics such as leanness, and reducing
   the incidence of bacterial contamination during processing and handling.
   3) Without compromising the traditional separation of public and private
   responsibilities, government and academia and industry will work more
   closely in identifying problems and developing practical solutions.}},

Abstract = {{A direct linear inverse method for eddy current non-destructive
   evaluation is presented in this paper. The method is based on inverting
   the impedance change measured in an eddy current probe, placed above a
   conducting half-space containing a three-dimensional (3D) conductivity
   anomaly. The eddy current probe used for this purpose consists of a
   spatially periodic, time-harmonic current sheet. The Born approximation
   is used to linearize the relevant integral equations used for inversion.
   It is found that a coupled Fourier-Laplace transform has to be inverted
   to provide a 3D reconstruction of the inhomogeneity in the conventional
   frequency domain; however, the transforms decouple in the time domain.
   The 3D inversion procedure is specialized to the 1D case of a
   uniform-current sheet. The conductivity variation with depth is now
   recovered by inverting a single Laplace transform. Numerical algorithms
   to invert Laplace transforms and similar Fredholm integral equations of
   the first kind are developed and used to implement the 1D inversion
   procedure. The algorithms are tested by the reconstruction of surface
   coatings of a constant, but different, conductivity from that of the
   underlying half-space. Surprisingly, certain features of the inversion
   algorithm are found to be exact for a layered half-space and independent
   of the Born approximation. These features enable us to reconstruct the
   depth and conductivity of the coatings exactly from the inverse Born
   profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Germination of Wasabia japonia Matsum. seeds, typical recalcitrant crop
   seeds in Japan, was investigated. Wasabia seeds have deep dormancy, but
   during storage the dormancy weakens. In eight months after harvest, the
   dormancy almost all disappears, resulting in the heavy sprouting of
   stored seeds.
   Optimum germination temperature is 15-degrees-C. In deep dormant period,
   20-degrees-C or higher temperature cannot induce full germination. At
   10-degrees-C, germination speed is very slow, though the similar
   germination percentage can be attained as in 15-degrees-C.
   GA4 is more effective than GA3 in breaking the dormancy. Germination
   percentage is higher and mean germinating days is smaller in GA4 than in
   GA3.
   BA and thiourea are effective to some extent for dormancy breaking.
   Combination of GA3 and BA shows about as the same effectiveness as GA4.
   Decoated seeds show almost perfect germination even in the deep dormant
   period, showing the cause of dormancy is mainly due to seedcoat.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of dietary deficiency of vitamin E and selenium
   on the ischemia-reperfusion model of renal injury in the rat.  Deficient
   diets imposed for six weeks on three-week-old weanling rats led to no
   significant differences in body weights, serum creatinine, GFR, RBF,
   TmPAH or urinary total protein excretory rates prior to ischemia. 
   Twenty-four hours after one hour of ischemia, animals on the deficient
   diet demonstrated more markedly impaired GFR, RBF, TmPAH and urine to
   plasma creatinine concentrations and an increased renal failure index. 
   Tubular damage was more severe injury in the deficient animals.  Lipid
   peroxidation, 15 minutes after the release of the ischemic clamp, was
   increased in the deficient animals.  We confirmed the effects of our
   dietary manipulation in impairing the oxidant scavenging system in the
   deficient animals since glutathione peroxidase activity was reduced to
   less than 5\% in the basal state, and this striking reduction persisted
   following ischemia.  Plasma vitamin E concentrations were also markedly
   depressed in the deficient diets.  This dietary deficiency also worsened
   the course of acute renal injury and was accompanied by 50\% mortality
   compared to 0\% mortality in the control animals.  Thus, dietary
   deficiency of vitamin E and selenium led to greater structural and
   functional renal impairment and increased lipid peroxidation following
   ischemia.  These data provide support for the role of reactive oxygen
   species in mediating ischemia-reperfusion injury.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a chewing stick
   and a tooth brush in plaque control.  The study composed of two groups
   of 11 and 8 children aged 13 to 16 years who were randomly selected from
   a peri-urban school near Nairobi.  Results showed that, except for the
   participants with moderate amounts of plaque, the net changes in the
   mean number of surfaces with a given plaque score were more when the
   participants were using a toothbrush than when they were using a chewing
   stick.  For the group of participants who started using a chewing stick
   before they changed to the toothbrush, there were no significant net
   changes in the mean number of surfaces with a given plaque score except
   for those surfaces which had mild plaque deposits.  It is concluded that
   for the patients with severe plaque deposits, the toothbrush is more
   efficacious than the chewing stick in plaque control.  However, for
   those patients with moderate plaque deposits, the chewing stick is as
   efficacious as the toothbrush in plaque control.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary esophageal achalasia due to malignancy is a rare condition;
   only 53 such cases have been reported to date. Sixty-two percent of the
   cases were due to gastric adenocarcinoma. Mesothelioma of the peritoneum
   is an uncommon neoplasm. The usual presenting symptoms are abdominal
   pain, abdominal mass, or abdominal distention. The patient we are
   reporting had peritoneal mesothelioma which presented with dysphagia and
   weight loss, in addition to the radiological and manometric picture of
   achalasia. Secondary achalasia was suspected clinically, and was
   confirmed by computed tomography and laparotomy. The diagnosis of
   peritoneal mesothelioma was made only by histopathological examination.
   We are not aware of any other report documenting the association of
   peritoneal mesothelioma and achalasia.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted to determine whether implantation with
   zeranol would reduce the aggressive behavior and probability of
   producing dark-cutting carcasses that characterize slaughter bulls. 
   Thirty-six bull calves were allocated to each of four treatments -
   nonimplanted bulls, steers castrated at an average age of 101 d, bulls
   implanted with 36 mg zeranol at an average of 101, 170, 263 and 319 d of
   age and bulls implanted on the latter three dates only.  The results
   reported include observations of weight gains, linear measurements,
   scrotal circumferences, serum testosterone concentrations, feed
   consumption, feed efficiency ratios and behavioral traits.  Bulls
   exceeded steers in weight gain during a feedlot test and in body length
   after 140 d on feed, but neither implantation treatment significantly
   affected the growth of bulls.  Feed consumption and conversion
   efficiency were lower in steers than in bulls, but were not
   significantly affected by implantation.  Scrotal circumference
   measurements and serum testosterone concentrations suggested that
   implantation reduced testicle development during the preweaning and
   early postweaning periods, but that this effect diminished or
   disappeared during the later postweaning period.  Implantation depressed
   aggressive and sexual activity between days 111 and 155 of the feedlot
   test.  When evaluated at 13-14 mo of age, both implanted groups reacted
   to preslaughter mixing of nonfamiliar animals with equivalent head
   bunting to, but less mounting activity than, nonimplanted bulls.  At
   15-16 mo of age, however, the implanted bulls exhibited more head
   bunting than nonimplanted bulls, and the early implanted group exhibited
   fully equivalent mounting activity to nonimplanted bulls.  The
   dark-cutting carcass condition was associated with mounting activity
   during preslaughter lairage.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of dietary fats on azoxymethane-induced colorectal
   carcinogenesis and erythrocyte, adipose, colon mucosa and tumor tissue
   fatty acids was investigated in 228 Wistar rats.  The two main diets
   compared were beef suet rich in saturated fatty acids and corn oil rich
   in a linoleic acid, an N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid.  The animals were
   placed in one of four dietary groups:  A = 5\% saturated fat, B = 20\%
   saturated fat, C = 5\% N-6 fat and D = 20\% N-6 fat.  There was no
   difference in the number of adenomas between any of the dietary groups. 
   The mean (+/- SEM) carcinoma yield per rat was A = 0.93 +/- 0.28, B =
   1.93 +/- 0.50, C = 0.70 +/- 0.07, D = 0.13 +/- 0.04; the tumour yields
   in rats fed the saturated fat diets were significantly different from
   each other and from those fed the N-6 fat diets.  The fatty acid
   profiles in all tissues were dependent upon the type and level of
   dietary fat and the tissue type.  Arachidonate was higher in tumours
   compared to normal mucosa.  Significant correlations were found between
   adipose linoleate (reflecting dietary intake) and tumour oleate and
   tumour arachidonate but not with the colorectal mucosa of control
   animals.  This is the first in vivo study to show reduced colorectal
   carcinogenesis by N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids.}},

   molecules (lymphocyte function associated antigen-1, intercellular
   adhesion molecule-1), chemotactic factors (interleukin-8, monocyte
   chemotactic/activating factor), and their modulatory cytokines (gamma
   interferon, tumor necrosis factor), it is possible to begin to ascribe
   specific molecules to cutaneous cellular reaction patterns.  The
   abnormal topobiology, or altered spatial distribution, of mononuclear
   cells, which gives rise to disease-specific patterns, was described in
   molecular terms.  A large number of diverse skin diseases were
   classified into six different groups, with each group highlighting
   distinctive cell types, adhesion molecules, chemotactic factors, and
   cytokines.  The diseases within each group, which shared functional
   anatomical reaction zones, were postulated to share common
   pathophysiologic pathways.  Thus, it is now possible, as one scans the
   microscopic field, to look past the static images of red- and
   blue-stained cells and appreciate a dynamic and detailed medley of
   molecularly defined events emanating from the eyepiece.}},

Abstract = {{The Fig Tree Group of the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa
   records the onset of tectonism and significant terrigenous and
   volcaniclastic sedimentation following a period of predominantly
   effusive volcanism.  In the southern part of the greenstone belt the
   lower Fig Tree conformably overlies the Onverwacht Group and can be
   grouped into either:  (1) volcaniclastic deposites consisting of
   pyroclastic and reworked volcanic detritus, or; (2) non-volcanogenic,
   terrigenous deposits of sandstone and conglomerate.  These petrologic
   groups are further divided into six lithofacies.
   The lithofacies within the lower Fig Tree Formation can be grouped into
   two facies associations:  (1) a subaqueous, delta-front association made
   up of fine-grained airfall pyroclastic and slightly reworked pyroclastic
   debris along with resedimented, land-derived sandstone and conglomerate,
   and (2) a subaerial association that is interpreted as forming from
   deposition of sandstone and conglomerate by flashy, ephemeral-stream
   proceses on an alluvial-fan surface.  The stratigraphic sequence
   coarsens upward from predominantly siltstone and fine-grained sandstone
   at the base to pebble and cobble conglomerate at the top.  This sequence
   is interpreted as forming from the progradation of a fan delta into a
   body of relatively shallow, quiet water.
   Composition of clasts in the conglomerates indicates that immediately
   underlying greenstone-belt rocks or coeval volcanic rocks were the
   source for these coarse sedimentary accumulations.  Erosion of uplifted
   greenstone-belt terrain was apparently only to shallow levels.  Both
   tectonic and volcanic activity played a role in producing several cycles
   of fan-delta progradation.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Ash-free dry weights and dry weights of each larval instar were
   determined for nine chironomid taxa using unpreserved material. Larval
   weight (w mu-g) was related to body length measurements (l mm) by the
   equation 1n w = ln a + b ln l.
   2. For a given taxon, the constants ln a and b were dependent on larval
   size and shape, respectively: b was found to increase with larval
   length, while taxa with characteristically stout larvae yielded higher
   values for ln a.
   3. Comparison of measurements of freshly-killed chironomid larvae with
   measurements taken after preservation in 70\% ethanol showed no change
   in body shape due to preservation. Length measurements from larvae
   preserved in this way are therefore suitable for use in the calculation
   of larval biomass when the relationship to the unpreserved weight is
   known.
   4. Maximum larval lengths and mean body proportions (length: width
   ratios) are reported for thirty-two chironomid taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in gel strength and myosin heavy chain of salt-ground meat from
   walleye pollack surimi were examined in relation to setting temperature
   in the range of 10-90-degrees-C.
   With the lapse of setting time at 30-degrees-C or below, gel strength of
   salt-ground meat was increased and reached its maximum plateau, whereas
   the gel strength was initially increased and subsequently decreased
   during the setting at 40-degrees-C or above.
   On the other hand, the amount of myosin heavy chain in salt-ground meat,
   as measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was largely
   decreased with a concomitant formation of cross-linked myosin heavy
   chains during the setting at 30-degrees-C or below, while the these
   changes in salt-ground meat were hardly observed at 40-degrees-C or
   above.
   These results indicate that the setting of salt-ground meat from walleye
   pollack may be regarded as the temperature-dependent cross-linking
   reaction of myosin heavy chains, contributing to production of elastic
   gel.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional alcoholic beverages of tropical Africa are produced in
   small holdings and can be divided roughly into (1): the palm-wines
   produced in the rain forest zone; (2): the beers made from cereals in
   the grasslands notably sorghum and to a lesser extent maize and/or
   wheat; and (3): the lesser beverages found in both regions and made from
   a variety of substrates especially bananas and honey. These beverages
   differ from European wines beers in that the producing organisms are not
   deliberately inserted and usually include yeasts and lactic acid
   bacteria which are alive and metabolising when the beverages are
   consumed; consequently the beverages are usually opaque, thick, and
   effervescent.
   Any procedures adopted in process scale-up must not alter the essential
   nature of these beverages in order to ensure their continued acceptance.
   Some of the strategies would include isolating, identifying, and
   genetically improving the organisms, and improving the process by
   altering the environmental parameters such as pH, etc, or the substrate,
   before pilot and commercial production.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the behaviour of advanced silicon nitride
   materials in reducing atmospheres (e.g. in coal gasification or in
   petrochemical plant).  In such atmospheres with low oxygen potential and
   containing sulphur volatile silicon sulphides are formed in addition to
   the volatile silicon oxide, so that corrosion would be accelerated.  In
   order to graphically represent these conditions a ``volatility map{''}
   is presented which shows the conditions in such atmospheres at 1200 and
   1300-degrees-C; the map shows the partial pressures of SiO and SiS (in
   equilibrium with Si or SiO2) vs oxygen and sulphur partial pressures. 
   The map shows various corrosion regions:  when SiO2 is not stable and
   high SiS partial pressures are predicted, corrosion may be catastrophic;
   when SiO2 is stable, the glassy surface layer initially prevents
   evaporation of SiS which, however, is gradually transformed into SiO,
   and high SiS partial pressures may result in internal sulphidation.}},

Abstract = {{Cholecystokinin octapeptide sulfate (CCK 8 S) appears to act via a
   serotonergic mechanism on several behavioral paradigms, including
   satiety.  In the present study, CCK 8 S was found to induce slight
   nonsignificant serotonergic changes in hypothalamic nuclei of the normal
   rat.  In the ``cafeteria{''} rat, however, it increased both 5-HT and
   5-HIAA levels in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), 5-HT levels in the
   paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and decreased 5-HIAA levels in the
   dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH).  These data suggest that the primary
   site of action of CCK 8 S is in the median hypothalamus, contrasting
   with an absence of effect in the lateral hypothalamus (LH).  The
   involvement of 5-HT in the effect of CCK 8 S is further suggested. 
   However, the relationship between these neurochemical changes and CCK 8
   S-induced satiety is not clear.  Nonetheless, a special sensitivity to
   CCK 8 S of the obese ``cafeteria{''} rat is evidenced, which contrasts
   with a reduced response of genetic obesity models.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of the extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin

   present within the cytoplasm of unfertilized eggs; in fertilized one- to
   four-cell embryos; by the eight-cell stage, TSP was also densely
   deposited at cell-cell borders.  In the blastocyst, although TSP was
   present in all three cell types; trophectoderm, endoderm, and inner
   cells mass (ICM), it was enriched in the ICM and at the surface of
   trophectoderm cells.  Hatched blastocysts grown on matrix-coated
   coverslips formed extensive trophoblast outgrowths on TSP, grew slightly
   less avidly on laminin, or on a 140-kD fragment of TSP containing its
   COOH terminus and putative cell binding domains.  There was little
   outgrowth on the NH2 terminus heparin-binding domain.  Addition to
   anti-TSP antibodies (but not GRGDS) to blastocysts growing on TSP
   strikingly inhibited outgrowth.  Consistent with its early appearance
   and presence in trophoblast cells during implantation, TSP may play an
   important role in the early events involved in mammalian embryogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochromism has been investigated in cathodically (WO3) and
   anodically (NiO(x)H(y)) coloured single films and two types of
   all-solid-state devices (ASSDs) for variable reflectance.  The ASSDs
   contain only WO3 or both electrochromic materials respectively. 
   Characterization was done by means of electrical and optical methods and
   electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA).  Spectral
   dependences of refractive indices n, extinction coefficients k and
   colouration efficiencies (CEs) are determined for single films as a
   function of the injected charge.  The CE is 37 cm2 C-1 for WO3 and 46
   cm2 C-1 for NiO(x)H(y) at a wavelength of 550 nm.  On the basis of these
   findings, different types of multilayer ASSDs are analysed and
   optimized.}},

Abstract = {{Thorough incorporation of urea into the soil is known to reduce the high
   N losses associated with the traditional practice of broadcasting urea
   onto puddled lowland rice fields.  Few studies have, however, examined
   the effectiveness of farm-level implements for incorporating broadcast
   urea during final land preparation in small rice fields.  A field
   experiment was conducted at two sites in the Philippines to compare the
   effectiveness of several commonly available and experimental tillage
   implements for basal incorporation of urea.  The relative effectiveness
   of N incorporation and relative susceptibility of N to ammonia
   volatilization losses were assessed from floodwater (urea +
   ammoniacal)-N and partial pressure of ammonia (pNH3) following urea
   application to puddled, unplanted soil.
   Conventional water buffalo- and single axle tractor-drawn comb harrows
   were equally, but only partially, effective in reducing floodwater (urea
   + ammoniacal)-N and pNH3 by 42 to 56\% of the values for broadcast
   prilled urea (PU) without incorporation.  Removal of the comb harrow
   from the single axle tractor did not reduce the effectiveness of PU
   incorporation, indicating that the cagewheel rather than the comb harrow
   was largely responsible for fertilizer incorporation.  An experimental
   conical puddler was slightly more effective than the conventional comb
   harrow.  The movement of transplanters through the field did not
   effectively incorporate PU.  A power weeder, frequently used by
   researchers to incorporate fertilizer in small experimental plots, was
   less effective than traditional comb harrows, reducing floodwater (urea
   + ammoniacal)-N by only 35\%.  No tillage implement for incorporating
   urea reduced pNH3 as effectively as did the liquid urea band injector.
   Results suggest that sizeable losses of fertilizer N still occur
   following incorporation of PU with tillage implements commonly used by
   small rice farmers.  Considerable scope remains for the improvement of
   fertilizer incorporation in puddled rice soils.}},

Abstract = {{We studied carnitine absorption in rats rendered azotemic by subtotal
   nephrectomy (RF) and compared the results with those obtained in a
   sham-operated group on liberal food intake (NL) and those pair-fed (PF)
   with the RF group.  Animals with short-term (2 weeks post-nephrectomy)
   and long-term (5-6 weeks post-nephrectomy) RF were studied.  In vivo
   recirculating perfusion was used.  A significant reduction in carnitine
   absorption (expressed per unit length) was noted in the short-term RF
   and PF groups when compared to the NL controls.  When the data were
   corrected for intestine weight, the short-term RF and PF groups showed
   comparable absorption rates with the NL group.  These findings suggest
   that in animals with short-term RF, weight loss is responsible for the
   observed alteration in carnitine absorption.  Intestinal segments from
   PF and short-term RF animals had significantly greater carnitine
   accumulation suggesting decreased release into the circulation.  In the
   long-term RF setting, RF and PF animals demonstrated reduced carnitine
   absorption.  When the data were expressed per unit of weight the
   absorption rates normalized, implicating reduced intestinal mass as the
   factor responsible for reduced carnitine absorption.  No significant
   difference was found in the amount of residual carnitine suggesting
   amelioration of impaired transport out of the enterocyte in chronic RF.}},

Abstract = {{To stabilize vertical and external kink modes in the elongated, indented
   PBX-M plasma, a close-fitting stainless-steel-clad aluminum conducting
   shell surrounds over 85\% of the plasma surface.  During normal
   operation, the currents induced in the shell by the plasma are small,
   usually reflecting changes in plasma shape initiated by the shaping
   control system.  However, voltage spikes of less than 2 kV were observed
   across gaps in the plates during both low-q and density limit
   disruptions.  After the thermal quench, the plasma became unstable to
   the n = 0 vertical mode.  The resulting rapid (20 to 5000 m/s, a
   resistive timescale) plasma motion induced large poloidal currents
   through segments of the shell to the vacuum vessel, despite the fact
   that each segment was electrically isolated except for a common
   single-point ground.  Through impact loading, these large currents
   caused the failure of insulators and mechanical members in the shell
   support structure.
   These events have been numerically simulated with a resistive force-free
   halo plasma surrounding the main plasma, which provides a current path
   between the plates along open field lines.  This model is consistent
   with measured plasma current decay times of 1-3 ms, characteristic of a
   resistive 10 eV plasma.  Confirmation that the duration of the
   post-disruption plasma is about a resistive tearing time was provided
   from bolometers viewing both along the mid-plane and into the divertors.
   About 30-60\% of the total energy and 30\% of the magnetic energy was
   radiated during the thermal and current quench phases.  This model led
   to improvements in the electrical configuration and insulator design
   which eliminated all failures.  Disruptions have been prevented even
   when radiating over 100\% of the input power during current profile
   control experiments with counter beam injection.}},

   wound infections was investigated at a community hospital. The serotypes
   of the Streptococcus isolated from all four cases, an asymptomatic
   anesthesiologist and one of his household members were M nontypable T28.
   During the outbreak period, December 1988, the infection rate among the
   40 patients of the anesthesiologist was 7.5\%. Among other patients not
   having contact with this healthcare worker, it was 0.09\% (p = .0002
   Fisher's exact test). This is only the second reported Group A
   beta-hemolytic Streptococcus hospital outbreak in which the pathogen was
   traced to a member of a healthcare worker's household. Early outbreak
   detection and intervention limited the extent of the outbreak.}},

Abstract = {{At present, the PC class of machine equipped with a modem and connected
   to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) finds many applications;
   access to electronic mail services, access to office computers by
   home-workers, occasional access to a mainframe from an isolated office,
   etc.  Two developments are coinciding which will affect this usage; PCs
   are being upgraded into much more sophisticated workstations, and the
   PSTN is to be replaced by the integrated services digital network
   (ISDN), a digital service offering much greater bandwidth.  These
   developments will have a significant effect on the ways in which
   isolated machines are used.  Some results are presented from an
   assessment made at University College London on the extent to which
   modes of usage currently prevalent on LANs might translate to the ISDN
   workstation.  Measurements have been made of traffic on a LAN, and
   extrapolations have been made to gauge the effects of interposing ISDN
   both on performance and on cost.}},

   metamorphose. Larvae must contact live L. glaciale or its spores for
   metamorphosis to occur; the inducer is not sensed in the water column.
   However, aqueous extracts of L. glaciale can induce metamorphosis,
   suggesting that the inducing factor is chemical. Neither ashed nor
   boiled L. glaciale induces metamorphosis, indicating that the factor is
   heat-labile and that thigmotaxis, per se, is not important in the
   response. The amino-acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which induces
   settlement of other marine invertebrate larvae, also induces significant
   rates of metamorphosis of S. droebachiensis at
   concentrations-lesser-than-or-greater-than-10(-4) M. A reduction (with
   antibiotics) in the number of live bacteria on the surface of L.

Abstract = {{In this work, we use an optical parametric oscillator, furnishing a
   pulsed infrared laser beam continuously tunable from 2.9 to 3.7-mu-m, in
   order to excite the asymmetric methyl (CH3a) and the hydroxyl (OH)
   stretchings of methanol condensed on a Cu(110) surface at 90 K.  The
   resonant character of the photodesorption process is demonstrated.  The
   relative intensity and the width of the resonant structures of the
   photodesorption yield spectra strongly depend on the laser fluence. 
   This is a direct consequence of the nonlinear dependence of the
   desorption yield versus the latter.
   The resonant structure corresponding to the OH group excitation is blue
   shifted of 100 cm-1 versus the OH band in the IRAS spectrum of the
   amorphous methanol film.  This testifies that the liquid phase plays an
   important role in the photodesorption mechanism.}},

   underlie the mineralized Goonumbla sequence, providing a maximum age for
   mineralization and suggesting that the two successions are largely
   coeval.
   The Ar-40/Ar-39 age spectra obtained in this investigation from
   fine-grained sericite illustrate the amenability of this hydrothermal
   phase to dating by the Ar-40/Ar-39 technique and suggest that there is
   considerable potential for application of this dating method to
   Phanerozoic ore deposits.  The close agreement in ages between the
   Ar-40/Ar-39 and U-Pb results gives confidence in the application of both
   dating techniques to altered Paleozoic rocks.}},

Abstract = {{I address three problems related to vibrational energy and phase
   relaxation at surfaces:  (a) I derive and discuss a simple relation
   between the change in the DC resistivity of a thin metallic film due to
   adsorption of molecules on the film surface and the electron-hole pair
   damping of the frustrated translations of the adsorbates.  (b) The line
   widths of adsorbate vibrational modes are often strongly influenced by
   disorder.  However, if strong dipole coupling occurs between the
   adsorbates, this tends to narrow the absorption band.  I show that, if
   DELTA-OMEGA denotes the band width associated with the dipole coupling
   and GAMMA the full width at half maximum of the disorder induced
   distribution of resonance frequencies, then for DELTA-OMEGA > 2-GAMMA
   the line narrowing is ``complete{''}, i.e. negligible contribution to
   the linewidth remains from the disorder.  (c) I discuss a new dephasing
   mechanism which results from the modulation of the dipole-coupling due
   to the thermal motion of the adsorbates.  This motion gives rise to
   temporal and spatial fluctuations in the adsorbate separations which
   result in a distribution of local fields that broaden and shift the
   absorption band.}},

Abstract = {{Descartes tells us to be without prejudice if we deal with a problem. It
   turns out that, in principle, we are not capable of being without
   prejudices or preconceived ideas. For economical reasons reference
   systems are established within which perception and cognition operate,
   and such reference systems can be studied experimentally in perception.
   One conclusion is the following definition of perception: It is the
   verification (or falsification) of a hypothesis (or a preconceived idea)
   which at a given moment a person has about the state of the world or his
   or her own condition. Preconceived ideas - or prejudices - also operate
   on the cognitive level and lead to unacceptable consequences in cases of
   social evaluation. No one can be free of prejudices; the only way to
   prevent negative consequences is to know about their existence.}},

Abstract = {{The authors report their preliminary experience with the Charleston
   bending brace for the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. 
   This brace holds the patient in the position of maximum side bend
   correction and is worn only at night.
   Patients in this prospective multicentered study met all the following
   criteria:  skeletal immaturity (Risser 0, 1 +, or 2+), curvature greater
   than 25-degrees before bracing, no prior treatment, and greater than
   1-year follow-up since initiation of treatment.  There were 191
   structural curves in the 139 patients.  One hundred fifteen patients
   (83\%) showed improvement or less than 5-degrees change in curvature. 
   Twenty-four patients (17\%) demonstrated an increase in curvature
   greater than 5-degrees.  Based on these preliminary results, continued
   use of bending brace treatment at nighttime only is justified for
   adolescent idiophatic scoliosis.  Patients with double curves should be
   observed closely for increase in compensatory curves.}},

Abstract = {{The immediate and proactive effects of controllable and uncontrollable
   stressors on plasma corticosterone were assessed in CD-1 mice. A
   progressive increase of plasma corticosterone concentrations was
   associated with graded increases in stressor severity. When a footshock
   stressor was employed, however, the magnitude of the glucocorticoid
   response, as well as the decay of plasma corticosterone concentrations,
   was independent of stressor controllability. This was the case
   regardless of the number of escapable vs. yoked inescapable shock trials
   mice received, the spacing of shock trials (i.e., applied within a
   single session or spaced over days), or the degree to which the escape
   response has been established. In contrast, in a swim task stressor
   controllability influenced plasma corticosterone concentrations provided
   that the escape response required of the animal was a highly prepared
   one (i.e., swim to an illuminated region). When mice were required to
   emit a contraprepared response (swim to dark) corticosterone
   concentrations did not differ between escapable and inescapable swim. It
   is suggested that glucocorticoid secretion is a fundamental response to
   stressors, and the differential effects of controllable and
   uncontrollable stressors will be most apparent when the response
   required of the animal is a highly prepared one.}},

Abstract = {{Glutaraldehyde (GA) has been proposed as an alternative to formocresol
   for pulpotomies in primary teeth and as an irrigant in root canal
   therapy.  These studies were undertaken to determine if GA can associate
   with the nucleus of living cells, thereby posing a mutagenic threat. 
   Rats were infused IV with C-14-GA and killed 5 min and 1 h later.  The
   cystolic, membrane, and nuclear fractions of harvested liver cells were
   separated and analyzed for radioactivity.  We determined that
   significant radioactivity was located in the cytosol and membrane
   fractions, but not in the nuclear fraction.  In an in vitro experiment,
   liver slices were incubated with C-14-GA in sealed vials in which
   C-14-CO2 was captured.  After 1 h the nucleic acids of the liver slices
   were isolated and counted.  In vitro the liver cells incorporated and
   metabolized GA to CO2 but no significant label could be detected in the
   isolated nucleic acids.  We concluded from these experiments that GA
   which was incorporated into liver cells did not reach the nucleus to a
   significant extent, and that its potential for mutagenicity in the
   context of pulp treatment was nil.}},

Abstract = {{The purposes of this study were to determine 1) whether posture affects
   the magnitude of cardiovascular adaptations to training and 2) whether
   cardiovascular adaptations resulting from exercise training in the
   supine posture transfer (generalize) to exercise in the upright posture
   and vice versa.  Sixteen sedentary men, aged 18-33 yr, were trained
   using high-intensity interval and prolonged continuous cycling in the
   supine (STG; supine training group) or upright (UTG; upright training
   group) posture 4 days/wk, 40 min/day, for 8 wk, while seven male
   subjects served as nontraining controls.  After training, maximal O2
   uptake measured during supine and upright cycling, respectively,
   increased significantly (P < 0.05) by 22.9 and 16.1\% in the STG and by
   6.0 and 14.6\% in the UTG.  No significant cardiovascular adaptations
   were observed at rest. During submaximal supine cycling at 100 W,
   significant increases in end-diastolic volume (21\%) and stroke volume
   (22\%) (radionuclide ventriculography and CO2 rebreathing) and decreases
   in heart rate, blood pressure, and systemic vascular resistance occurred
   in the STG, whereas only a significant decrease in blood pressure
   occurred in the UTG.  During upright cycling at 100 W, a significant
   decrease in blood pressure occurred in the STG, whereas significant
   increases in end-diastolic volume (17\%) and stroke volume (18\%) and
   decreases in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance occurred in
   the UTG.  Volume of myocardial contractility, ejection fraction, and
   systolic blood pressure-to-end-systolic volume ratio did not change
   significantly after training when measured during supine and upright
   cycling in either training group.  Blood volume increased significantly
   in the UTG but remained unchanged in the STG.  No significant metabolic
   or cardiovascular changes occurred in the control group.  It was
   concluded that the magnitude of cardiovascular adaptations to training
   in the supine and upright posture is not different.  However, changes
   are, for the most part, specific to the training posture.}},

Abstract = {{A report about the trials of machining tests with cast iron using both

   optimized tool lives for the various samples were:
   15 min at cutting speed of 140 m/min for alumina 19 min at a cutting
   speed of 140 m/min for ZTA 13 min at a cutting speed of 200 m/min for
   sialon.
   From log/log graphs of tool life vs. cutting speeds, ``n{''} values
   obtained were 0,74, 0,67 and 0,89 for the alumina, ZTA and sialon,
   respectively.  While abrasion was the dominant wear mechanism for
   alumina and ZTA, diffusion and plastic yielding were dominant wear
   mechanisms for sialon.}},

   the fifth harmonic generation (213 nm).  For comparison purposes, the
   above materials were also ablated by 266 nm (fourth-harmonic) laser
   radiation.  Light and electron microscopy demonstrated that the damage

Abstract = {{The developmental expression and the cellular localization of
   neurogranin (formerly designated p 17), a brain-specific protein kinase
   C (PKC) substrate, were investigated.  The developmental expression of
   neurogranin was studied by immunoblotting of rat brain and neuronal
   cell-culture extracts using neurogranin polyclonal antibodies.
   Neurogranin synthesis was found to be developmentally regulated, with no
   expression in the embryonic and neonatal period and an abrupt increase
   between 2 and 3 weeks of age.  By immunohistochemistry, neurogranin was
   found essentially in the adult rat telencephalon, specifically located
   in the cell bodies and dendritic processes of neurons of the cerebral
   cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and a few other discreet areas.
   Neurogranin immunoreactivity was nearly absent in the thalamus,
   cerebellum, and brain stem.  The late developmental expression and the
   dendritic localization of neurogranin in neurons are 2 features that
   also characterize the type I PKC isozyme.  The specific localization of
   the protein in integrative areas of the rat brain suggests a highly
   specialized function of neurogranin in the CNS.  A possible role for
   neurogranin in the transduction of the PKC activation signals at the
   postsynaptic level is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of stretch on coronary pressure-flow relations are not well
   understood. To examine the role of wall stretch per se on coronary
   hemodynamics, we studied arterially perfused isolated canine
   interventricular septa in a noncontracting state with vasodilated
   vessels. We compared the hemodynamic parameters of zero-flow pressure
   and resistance during passive stretching in the circumferential and the
   base-to-apex directions alone as well as during simultaneous biaxial
   stretching in both directions. Even in the unloaded state the zero-flow
   pressure was positive. Any type of stretching significantly increased
   the zero-flow pressure and the resistance from their unloaded values.
   The pressure-flow responses also showed directional dependence. When
   stretches with matched strains or stresses in each direction were
   applied sequentially, the resistance increases corresponded to the
   direction of higher stress. Conversely, the zero-flow pressure response
   increase corresponded to the direction of greater strain. However,
   neither response correlated with a measure of global tissue stiffness.
   Thus there is a complex and tight mechanical interaction between the
   vessels and the surrounding tissue. These interactions, but not the
   tissue stiffness, are important determinants of coronary pressure-flow
   responses during stretch.}},

   Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and its variants
   appeared to be increasingly utilised as treatment for children with
   end-stage renal failure (ESRF) and accounted for approximately 25\% of
   all renal replacement therapy (RRT). Important differences in its use in
   various European countries are demonstrated. The proportional
   contribution of CAPD to treatment was higher during the first year of
   RRT and gradually decreased thereafter. No significant sex differences
   existed in the use of this treatment. Approximately 70\% of all patients
   on CAPD were older than 6 years of age, but it is in those under 6 years
   that the highest proportion are put on CAPD as first method of treatment
   for end-stage renal failure. The most common cause of abandonment of
   this treatment was peritonitis, which contributed 50\% of the drop-out
   rate.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of periocular anaesthesia and its complications were
   examined in 100 successive cataract operations.  The patients were
   divided into 3 groups according to the duration of ocular compression
   with an Autopressor (R) device after administration of periocular
   anaesthesia.  In the control group, no compression was used (C-0, n = 36
   patients).  In the other two groups, compression was used for 10 (C-10,
   n = 32) and for 20 (C-20, n = 32) min.  No differences in globe or
   orbicular akinesia were found between the groups.  At 10 min,
   immobilisation of the globe in different directions was attained in
   60.1-84.5\% of the patients.  Compression for an additional 10 min did
   not significantly improve the akinesia.  In contrast, the hitherto
   undescribed loss of light perception increased with time:  15 patients
   at 10 min and 22 at 20 min were unable to see light.  Chemosis and
   haematomas in the upper eyelid occurred more often in C-0 than in the
   other 2 groups.  One day postoperatively the average palpebral aperture
   was smaller in C-0 than in the other two groups.  The frequent
   postoperative ptosis (74.3\% on the 1st day) decreased rapidly, but on
   postoperative day 7, 9 patients still had ptosis.  In only one patient
   was ptosis still recognizable at 6 weeks postoperatively.  No serious
   complications occurred.  This study demonstrates that periocular
   anaesthesia with ocular compression is a suitable method for cataract
   surgery.}},

   and bone marrow affection are the rarest.  Intravital diagnosis is
   complicated.  As a rule, the disease manifests primarily with radicular
   syndrome followed by marrow compression, asymmetric compression of the
   roots of cauda equina and pelvic disfunction.  The cerebrospinal fluid
   becomes xanthochromic with hyperalbuminosis and albuminocytologic
   dissociation.  Myelography shows filling defect.  Spinal x-ray
   examination detects specific changes of the vertebra and ossification
   foci.  Unfavorable epidemiological situation may be indicative of
   probable infection and prompt a valid diagnosis.  Surgery is advocated
   as the only adequate treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The sperm is the product secreted by the testis and the annex glands. 
   Leucospermia has been taxed of reducing the fertilizing capacities of
   the sperm.  In this work, we have sought whether the presence in the
   sperm of leucocytes in great number is linked to an epididymal
   pathology.  We have analysed 235 sperms, among which 65 azoospermic (35
   leucospermic and 30 non leucospermic), 84 oligozoospermic (52
   leucospermic and 32 non leucospermic) and 86 normospermic (36
   leucospermic and 50 non leucospermic).  We have found that the activity
   of the alpha 1-4 glucosidase in the sperm is the same with leucospermic
   and non leucospermic subjects whatever is the concentration of the sperm
   in spermatozoa.  This means that leucospermia is of prostatic and
   vesicular origin rather than epididymal and interferes in masculine
   infertility through changes in vesicular and prostatic liquids or a
   stimulated immune response with synthesis of anti-spermatozoa
   antibodies.}},

Abstract = {{Over a period of one year 101 sperm samples from a four year old mouflon
   ram were analyzed.  Along with an estimation of the general health of
   the animal, an evaluation of the genital organs and rutting behaviour;
   the ejaculation volume, color, and consistency of the semen samples were
   determined.  Sperm motility, concentration, and per cent abnormal sperm
   cells were also analyzed.  The non-specific germ content and the
   hydrogen ion concentration of the semen samples were determined.  The
   samples were obtained using an artificial vagina.  The ram showed normal
   rutting behaviour under these conditions.  The results show that the
   mouflon ram has a physiological resting stage between the beginning of
   February and the end of April.  The data evaluated from the sample
   obtained during this period cannot negate the fertility of the ram even
   though no pregnant ewes can be presented as evidence.}},

Abstract = {{Five polymorphic enzyme genes (Est-1, Est-5, Got-2, Pgi-2 and 6-Pgdh-1)
   were studied in Lower Austrian populations of the herbaceous, allogamous
   polyploid complex Galium pusillum agg.  Allele frequencies in the relic
   G. austriacum-2x document a high amount of genetic differentiation
   between the isolated, rather uniform and stenoecious populations which
   are separable into an older mountain and a more recent foothill series.
   Genetic divergence from G. austriacum-2x is small in G. austriacum-4x
   and only somewhat greater in G. pumilum-8x.  Allele frequencies in the
   4x (and 8x) suggest tetrasomic inheritance and autopolyploid behaviour
   in spite of nearly exclusive bivalent formation.  The amount of genic
   variation (number of different alleles and average heterozygosity)
   appears uniform in diploids and polyploids.  In contrast, the polyploids
   exhibit much increased genotypic variation as compared to the diploids.
   This can be linked to their more continuous, variable, euryoecious and
   expansive populations.}},

Abstract = {{This research was carried out in Lages, SC, Brazil, during 1985/86,
   1986/87 and 1987/88 growing seasons, with the purpose of evaluate the
   yield and components of corn varieties and hybrids at two planting
   populations and two fertility levels.  The traits were disposed in a
   split-split plot design.  The fertility levels tested were no fertilizer
   and 20,80 and 70 kg per hectare of N, P2O5 and K2O, respectively, at
   planting, plus 80 kg of N as side-dressing.  The cultivars were sowed at
   25.000 and 50.000 plants/hectare.  At 1985/86 growing season a low grain
   yield was observed due to water stress.  In this year the fertility
   level and plant population did not affect grain yield.  The better
   frequence and distribution of rains at 1986/87 and 1987/88 growing
   seasons increased grain yield and fertility response of cultivars,
   specially at 50.000 plants/ha population.  In these years hybrids
   presented higher grain yield than varieties at both fertility levels and
   plant population tested.}},

Abstract = {{Activation of resting human B lymphocytes either by cross-linking their
   membranal lgM or by phorbol esters has been previously demonstrated to
   modulate the type II receptor for Fc-gamma domains (Fc-gamma-RII):
   shortly after stimulation a decrease in lgG binding capacity and an
   enhancement of Fc-gamma-RII expression were observed. These were
   followed by the release of Fc-gamma-RII fragments from the cell
   membrane. Since protein phosphorylation is a well-established signal
   transduction element, we examined whether Fc-gamma-RII may be a target
   of such activation induced phosphorylation. Resting (high density) and
   activated (low density) human tonsil B lymphocytes were stimulated
   either by cross-linking their surface lgM (slgM) or by the phorbol ester
   TPA. This treatment induced specific phosphorylation of a 36 kd membrane
   protein. This polypeptide was shown to specifically bind to lgG-coated
   Sepharose beads or to monoclonal Fc-gamma-RII-specific antibody-coated
   Affi-Gel 10 beads; thus, it most probably corresponds to the
   Fc-gamma-RII of these cells. In addition, phosphorylation of a 20 kd
   protein with similar binding characteristics was also observed in
   several experiments. Both serine and tyrosine were the amino acids that
   underwent phosphorylation in the 36 kd Fc-gamma-RII. The extent of
   Fc-gamma-RII phosphorylation correlated with the increase in receptor
   expression as monitored by specific mAb binding and, at the same time,
   with the decrease in the capacity to bind lgG-sensitized erythrocytes.
   These results suggest that stimulation-induced phosphorylation of
   Fc-gamma-RII on B cells is an early signal transduction element involved
   in controlling B cell response.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis is made of vertical wind disturbances (VWDs) observed by the
   MU radar (Shigaraki, Shiga, Japan) in terms of the wave structures,
   sources, and vertical momentum flux.  First, it is shown through
   spectral and lag-correlation analyses that there are several common
   features in three observation periods when the VWDs appeared:  large
   power in the vertical wind fluctuations exists below a height of
   approximately 20 km and is distributed largely at lower frequencies. 
   The decrease in power near 20 km is sharp and the correlation between
   vertical winds above and below the level is very small, suggesting that
   the height of 20 km is a special level for the VWDs such as a critical
   level.  The disturbances below 20 km consist of several modes in a
   height-frequency space, some of which oscillate almost in phase in a
   wide height range spanning approximately 8 km at the maximum.
   Second, using eight sets of the MU radar data, the relationship between
   vertical wind activity and horizontal wind near the surface is examined
   in order to identify the source of the VWDs.  The activity of the
   vertical wind is closely related to both direction and strength of the
   horizontal wind near the surface at Yonago (about 250 km west of
   Shigaraki).  This indicates that the VWDs are due mainly to gravity
   waves generated by the effect of topography with heights of
   approximately 1000 m located between Yonago and Shigaraki.  The features
   obtained through the wave structure analysis can be interpreted well as
   characteristics of topographically forced waves.
   Finally, vertical momentum flux associated with the VWDs is examined. 
   Although it is generally difficult to examine the vertical momentum flux
   associated with quasi-stationary mountain waves from observations at one
   location, the estimation is possible to some extent when the spatial
   phase fluctuates largely according to temporal changes of the background
   wind.  As a result, some of the VWDs' characteristics on the momentum
   flux consistent with the view of mountain waves are obtained.}},

   parameters for professional tattoos, there was complete pigment removal
   in two, nearly complete pigment removal in five, significant pigment
   removal in 18, minimal pigment removal in 25, and very little pigment
   removal in 12. Professional tattoos with red, yellow, and green pigments
   faded, but required multiple retreatments. While transient
   hypopigmentation occurred in many patients, skin texture and hair growth
   returned to normal in all cases and no hypertrophic scarring was seen.}},

Abstract = {{New H-1-receptor antagonists are assessed not only for their H-1
   antihistaminic activity but also for their central nervous system (CNS)
   side effects.  Fifteen healthy subjects received a once daily dose of 5
   mg, 10 mg or 20 mg of epinastine, or a twice daily dose of 60 mg of
   terfenadine or placebo in a randomized double-blind (double-dummy)
   crossover study.  The response to histamine-induced skin wheals was
   compared.  CNS effects were evaluated by a multiple reaction time task,
   a finger tapping test and a self-rating scale (Bf-S von Zerssen) to
   assess mood state.  Epinastine attenuated the wheal size in response to
   histamine in a dose-dependent manner.  In addition, all epinastine
   dosages had a distinctly faster onset of action than terfenadine.  All
   active treatments (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg epinastine and 60 mg terfenadine)
   attained their maximum effects 4 h after administration.  At this time
   point and also 12 h after administration, 20 mg of epinastine were
   significantly more effective as than 60 mg of terfenadine.  Single 10 mg
   and 20 mg doses of epinastine were as effective as terfenadine given
   twice daily, and significantly more effective than placebo 24 h after
   drug administration (i.e. 12 h after the second dose of terfenadine). 
   The psychometric tests for CNS effects did not reveal any difference
   among epinastine, terfenadine and placebo.  In conclusion, epinastine is
   one of the most effective peripherally acting H1 antagonist which lacks
   significant CNS side effects and is suitable as a once daily dosage
   regimen.}},

Abstract = {{1.  The precentral cortex of three Macaca mulatta monkeys were mapped
   with intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) while the monkeys performed
   alternating wrist flexion and extension movements.  A forearm
   cocontraction task was also employed with one monkey.  Electromyogram
   (EMG) recordings from forearm muscles were used to evaluate the results
   of ICMS.
   2.  We have found that the results of ICMS can be misleading if EMG
   activity is not recorded from the responding muscle.  Inhibition can be
   interpreted as excitation if muscle palpation or joint movement are the
   only response criteria.
   3.  Movement of the stimulating electrode by as little as 200-mu-m in a
   single radial column sometimes changed EMG responses from inhibition to
   excitation or vice versa, indicating that cortical inhibitory areas for
   a muscle can be located very close to excitatory zones.
   4.  Both excitation and inhibition of muscles could be produced with
   ICMS of precentral cortex when the animal was performing a task
   involving the muscles being mapped.  EMG responses to ICMS were stable,
   provided that the stimulation was applied at the same time during a
   repetitive task such that the motoneurons were at a given level of
   excitability.
   5.  Zones were ICMS produced inhibition of a particular forearm muscle
   were interspersed among zones that produced excitation for that muscle.
   6.  Regions exist in precentral cortex where ICMS activates antagonistic
   wrist muscles producing cocontraction.
   7.  The extensive cortical region from which any individual muscle can
   be activated or suppressed with ICMS and the various combinations of
   muscles that are activated from within this region, suggest that
   different types of movements involving a single muscle are represented
   at different locations within this region.
   8.  At a few locations in precentral cortex, the EMG responses to ICMS
   were not just a function of the level of excitation of the motoneuron
   pool at the time of stimulation but were also dependent on the specific
   task the monkey was performing at the time of stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{A magnetic polarity reversal near the top of the Tumblagooda Sandstone,
   in the Carnavon Basin, Western Australia, has been intensively
   investigated in five coastal sections and four inland sections, all
   located near the top of the formation.  A further four inland sections
   toward the base of the formation were also sampled.  Of the inland
   sections, all but two are suspected to have been largely remagnetized in
   similar fashion to Late Paleozoic and Meozoic sediments to the south.
   At the remaining seven sections a zone of normal magnetization overlies
   a zone of mixed (coexisting normal and reversed) magnetization, and the
   boundary between them coincides with a unique marker horizon of pebbly
   sandstone.  The intimate relationship of the (virtual) reversal and the
   pebble marker horizon lends strong support to the suggestion that
   erosional stripping accompanied the formation of the pebble marker.  The
   pebble marker is best interpreted as a lag deposit.   The stratigraphic
   coincidence does not necessarily signify the concurrence of a reversal
   with the formation of the marker horizon, but rather that the
   relationship represents a variation on the unconformity test.  The
   record of the actual geomagnetic reversal has been physically removed
   from most sections.
   These results show conclusively that the age of the magnetization of the
   Tumblagooda Sandstone is very close to the age of deposition, and can
   therefore provide an important pole for the definition of the Gondwana
   apparent polar wander path.  However, the suggested Silurian age must be
   questioned on the basis of the palaeomagnetism which best accords with
   an Ordovician age.  The lower parts of the sequence may be as old as the
   Cambrian.  While the age of the palaeomagnetic pole from the Tumblagooda
   is therefore not well constrained, its position is well defined and in
   combination with other Gondwana poles indicates a period of rapid polar
   motion during the Ordovician/Silurian.  A collision with Laurasia at the
   end fo the Silurian and beginning of the Devonian may explain the timing
   of the Caledonian/Acadian Orogenies.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary sex characteristics and the correlated physiological
   parameters of fallow deer (Dama dama L.) were investigated under the
   influence of various experimental photoperiods as well as in respect to
   their resynchronization ability.  For the first time a group of adult
   large mammals were subjected over a period of years without interruption
   to various experimentally accelerated photoperiods in an artificial
   environment, after which they were resynchronized under natural
   conditions.  The development of the skull as well as of the antler buds
   and roses clearly demonstrated an earlier maturity under accelerated
   photop eriods compared to normal conditions.  The apparent discrepancy
   between the calendar and biological ages of the deer is discussed.
   The consideration of the endocrinological pre-requisites for the
   seasonal changes in secondary sex characteristics includes a wide range
   of aspects.  Where appropriate ethological observations are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of selecting for growth, size and efficiency on fitness
   (fertility and survival rate) and body composition was investigated by
   surveying a number of selection experiments which have appeared in
   Animal Breeding Abstracts since 1938.  In the case of rodents and
   poultry, selection for body mass, growth rate and feed efficiency was
   studied in 26, 21 and 13 experiments respectively.  Much less
   information on the relationship between growth, size or efficiency and
   fitness is available for beef cattle and mutton sheep.  When selecting
   for increased body mass or growth rate in rodents and poultry, almost
   90\% of the experiments yielded data which demonstrated an increase in
   body fat, or a decrease in fitness, or both in the offspring.  When
   selecting for increased feed efficiency, only 15\% of the experiments
   surveyed reported unfavourable results.  In general, the relationship
   between growth rate or body mass and fertility in beef cattle tends to
   be negative.  Animal breeding for meat should therefore not be based on
   selection for growth or size alone.  Other selection criteria should be
   investigated and the principle of utilizing sire and dam lines in beef
   cattle should receive attention.}},

Abstract = {{Severe bleedings and infections following gastroscopy may lead to life
   threatening complications.  A 56-year-old patient underwent a
   Billroth-II gastrectomy because of gastric cancer.  Following endoscopic
   removal of a biopsy acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurred which
   ceased after administration of fresh-frozen plasma and >>prothrombin
   complex<<.  The following day she developed a septic shock with
   disseminated intravascular coagulation and neurological symptoms.  In
   the bone marrow aspirate Escherichia coli could be identified.  The
   radionuclide bone- and marrow scan revealed a generalized osteomyelitis
   and an extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis.  High-dose triple
   antibiotic therapy provided temporary relief of the clinical symptoms. 
   Four weeks later she developed multiple fractures of the thoracic
   vertebral bodies, ilium and ischium.  A type-IV bone-marrow aplasia
   developed with insufficient hematopoiesis.  The patient died as a result
   of the osteomyelitis and aplasia.  Bacteriological examination of the
   gastric contents was not performed in order to proof the focus.  The
   short-time interval relating to the bleeding event, the E. coli sepsis
   and no evidence for another cause of the bacteremia makes the biopsy as
   the original focus more likely.  Consequently, antibiotic prophylaxis
   should be administered in high-risk patients with valvular heart disease
   and should also be considered in patients with compromised defense.}},

Abstract = {{In the present experiments we extend previous findings that established
   a relationship between feeding behavior and hypothalamic serotonin as
   measured by in vivo microdialysis. The new result is hypothalamic
   release of serotonin in anticipation of eating when the animal sees and
   smells food. We have now verified brain serotonin peaks in four
   different ways: 1) a serotonergic reuptake blocker (fluoxetine 1 or
   10-mu-M) in the perfusion medium raised basal levels of serotonin, 2)
   every sample was oxidized at two potentials using a dual potentiostat to
   confirm the voltage characteristics of each peak, 3) serotonin peaks
   were reduced by the selective serotonin cell body agonist,
   8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), thus helping
   confirm that most of the serotonin observed in these experiments was
   neuronal in origin, and 4) lateral and medial hypothalamic microdialysis
   probes were used simultaneously to monitor the degree of diffusion from
   one to the other. The results show that extracellular serotonin
   increases at both sites during preingestive events as well as during
   eating, but not afterwards.}},

Abstract = {{The rate adaptive TX{*} pacemaker uses the evoked QT interval as an
   indicator of physiological demand.  In order to obtain a rate adaptation
   close to physiological patterns we used in the past, in each patient, on
   the slope value and/or the T wave sensing window, controlling via
   exercise stress testing and Holter the results achieved.  It was an
   expensive method, but the system produced effective rate responsive
   pacing.  The new series of TX{*} pacemakers (Quintech 919 and Rhythmyx),
   beside the dynamic slope feature, are equipped with a 1-hour heart rate
   Holter (HRH) that can be used during effort without the need for
   manually recording the heart rate.  In this mode TX{*} pacemakers
   calculate the average heart rate over 20-second periods and stores the
   values continuously for 1 hour.  In addition, a 24-hour HRH is
   available, which calculates the average heart rate over 7.5-minute
   periods, showing heart rate trend during the last day prior to
   interrogation.  Each HRH can be accessed by the programmer and printed
   out.  Using four Quintech 919{*} and five Rhythmyx units, the inbuilt
   HRH proved its utility by making the heart rate adaptation checking
   procedure easier, faster, and more economic.}},

Abstract = {{An endogenous inhibitor of calcium activated neutral proteinase has been
   purified from human placenta.  The procedure included chromatography on

   neutral proteinase inhibitor was a tetramer with identical subunits of
   molecular weight 68 kDa.  It was specific for milli calcium activated
   neutral proteinase (Calpain II) which is inhibited by the formation of
   an inactive enzyme-inhibitor complex and not by sequestering Ca2+ from
   the medium.  Although micro calcium activated neutral proteinase
   (Calpain I) was not inhibited by endogenous calcium activated neutral
   proteinase inhibitor, it was protected from autolysis in the presence of
   the inhibitor.  The placental endogenous calcium activated neutral
   proteinase inhibitor thus regulates Ca2+ activated proteolysis by
   ensuring micro calcium activated neutral proteinase activity, while

   biological interest, from a mechanistic point of view, the formation of
   these adducts provides good support for the formation of the respective
   free-radical precursors. In particular, evidence is provided for the
   formation of the N(3)-centred radical formed by deprotonation of the
   thymidine radical cation at this position. Other important radicals
   formed are centred at the C(5), C(6), C(5'), and the methyl-group

Abstract = {{For typical values of rock friction, active faults may be defined as
   favorably oriented for frictional reactivation, unfavorably oriented, or
   severely misoriented, depending on their attitude in the prevailing
   stress field.  Continued reactivation of unfavorably oriented faults
   requires fluid pressures (P(f)) elevated well above hydrostatic values
   to prevent the formation of new, more favorably oriented faults.  In
   cases of severe misorientation, a necessary prefailure condition is that
   the least principal stress becomes effectively tensile, that is P(f) >
   sigma-3.  As a consequence, low-stress hydrofracture dilatancy is likely
   to develop in regions of rupture nucleation on such faults prior to
   failure.  Triggering of shear failure through the buildup of fluid
   pressure to meet this specific condition then becomes probable.
   Steep reverse faults require slightly supralithostatic fluid pressures
   for continued reactivation.  Vein systems associated with ancient
   high-angle reverse faults demonstrate that this prefailure condition was
   met repeatedly.  Failure episodes on such faults involve fault-valve
   action, where transient postseismic rupture permeability promotes upward
   fluid discharge from overpressured portions of the crust, followed by
   self-sealing and reaccumulation of fluid pressure.  In compressional
   regimes, where steep reverse faults and severely misoriented strike-slip
   faults are currently active, there is direct evidence in several
   instances for fluid pressure levels approaching lithostatic values, and
   rupturing is occasionally followed by postseismic discharge.  Where
   fault-valving occurs, recurrence intervals depend on strength reductions
   from increasing fluid pressure as well as on the rate of tectonic stress
   accumulation, and may be highly irregular.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Many studies of nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins have focused
   on the transcriptional regulation of their expression.  The genes (rbcS)
   encoding the small subunit (SSU) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
   carboxylase/oxygenase, a major stromal protein, comprise one such group.
   We have examined the role played by post-transcriptional events in
   determining the relative levels of individual rbcS mRNAs in different
   organs of the aquatic monocot lemna gibba.  L. gibba is unusual among
   angiosperms in that its roots are normally exposed to light during
   growth and contain chloroplasts.  We have found that such roots
   transcribe rbcS genes and contain rbcS mRNA.  We have used
   sequence-specific probes from the 3'-untranslated region of six rbcS
   genes from L. gibba to analyze the expression of the individual genes in
   different organs.  All six genes were expressed in steady-state mRNA in
   fronds grown in constant white light.  However, only five of these were
   easily detectable in steady-state MRNA isolated from roots of the same
   plants, and the relative expression of each gene varied between the
   roots and the fronds.  In steady-state mRNA, SSU1 was found to be highly
   expressed in both roots and fronds, whereas SSU40B was expressed at low
   levels in the roots as compared with the fronds, and SSU5B RNA was
   barely detectable in the roots.  The extremely low level of SSU5B RNA in
   steady-state root mRNA is likely to be a consequence of
   post-transcriptional events because this gene was transcribed at
   comparable rates in vitro in nuclei isolated from either roots or
   fronds.  Localization of individual gene transcripts by in situ
   hybridization showed that SSU1 and SSU5B are expressed in the same cells
   in the fronds.  Thus, the mechanism of differential expression is likely
   to involve an organ-specific post-transcriptional mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Integrative expression vector pST6 was developed for dicote plant
   transformation. The vector contains neomycine phosphotransferase gene
   under control of P(NOS) promoter which confers kanamycin resistance to
   transformed plant cells. The vector also includes expression cassette
   with strong constitutive 35S CaMV promoter for cloning of foreign genes.
   The human recombinant alfa interferon gene has been inserted into the
   expression cassette of pST6. Recombinant plasmid obtained was transfered
   into Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells, where the plasmid integrated into
   disarmed Ti plasmid pVG2260. Transgenic tobacco plants were obtained via
   transformation of leaf discs. It was determined that the interferon gene
   was inserted into plant genome. Transcription and translation of human
   interferon was observed in the plants transformed.}},

Abstract = {{Daily catches from the net and coble and fixed-engine fisheries at the
   mouth of the Aberdeenshire Dee have been analysed together with mean
   daily river flow rates for the years 1973-1986 inclusive.  There was no
   indication that flow was a significant factor in determining the size of
   the net catch from one year to the next.
   In most years, the logarithms of daily flow and catch from both
   fisheries were significantly correlated over the netting season as a
   whole.  This may have been the result of a coincidence of independent
   seasonal trends in flow and catch rather than a direct effect of river
   flow on net catches of salmon.
   Catches in the net and coble fishery were not uniformly high on days of
   low flow.  Indeed, a wide range of catches was taken at low flows
   throughout the netting season.  Low summer flows were not associated
   with higher than average net catches.  Indeed, only during April were
   mean daily catches, associated with a restricted range of flow rates,
   significantly higher than mean daily catches calculated for the month as
   a whole.  Such flows occurred at river flows between Q30 and Q35 for
   April, and the increase in catch accounted for 4.3\% of the net and
   coble catch in April, and 0.5\% of all net and coble catches over the
   study period.}},

   The activity was detected in a fraction precipitated between 30-50\%

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted under rainfed conditions at the Indian
   Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India with a view (i) to
   find out the possibility of introducing mungbean and sorghum as an
   intercrop with a short duration variety of pigeonpea, (ii) to assess the
   effects of planting geometry on the growth and productivity of pigeonpea
   and intercrops, and (iii) to study the effects of phosphate (P)
   fertilization on growth and yield components of pigeonpea in sole and
   intercropped systems.
   Intercropping adversely affected the growth and yield performance of
   pigeonpea.  Sorghum as an intercrop, however, offered more competition
   than mungbean.  Planting geometry had no effect on growth and yield of
   pigeonpea but the productivity of intercrops per unit area was more in
   paired row pattern than in uniform row pattern largely because of a
   higher plant population in the former system.  Pigeonpea and both
   intercrops responded favourably to P application.  Pigeonpea as a sole
   crop responded significantly up to 60 kg P2O5 ha-1 only while the
   intercropped pigeonpea and intercrops continued to respond up to 90 kg. 
   The implications of these results in relation to management of cropping

Abstract = {{Samples from the Duperow, Souris River, and Dawson Bay formations
   collected from a mine shaft near Esterhazy, Saskatchewan, contain the
   stromatoporoids that are described in this paper. The lower beds of the
   Duperow Formation, corresponding to members 1 and 2, contain a
   stromatoporoid fauna of 11 species, most of which occur in the Upper
   Cairn and Peechee formations of the Rocky Mountains. The underlying
   Souris River fauna consists of two species known from the correlative
   Beaverhill Lake, Mikkwa, Flume, and Cairn formations. Seven species were
   identified from the Dawson Bay Formation, of which the most diagnostic
   is Schistodictyon bailliei McCammon.
   Widening the species concept applied to stromatoporoids places several
   species described from these intervals in synonymy, decreases apparent
   endemism, and leads to the recognition of the wide distribution of the
   Flume-Cairn fauna from the Northwest Territories to Iowa.}},

   agglutination and lysis of two trypanosome species (Trypanosoma
   congolense and Trypanosoma brucei brucei), although Glossina palpalis
   gambiensis caused only agglutination.  The trypanolysin and agglutinin
   were active only in the posterior midguts, were heat labile above
   50-degrees-C, had a periodic cycle of `activity' in response to
   bloodmeal intake and were not affected by protease inhibitors or trypsin
   but were inactivated by pronase.  The lytic substance contained two
   proteins with approximate molecular weights (M(r)) of 12 000 and 10 000
   Da respectively.  The agglutinin had an approximate M(r) of 67 000 Da.

   findings demonstrated that the resultant complexes were related to the

   were examined in the reactions of pseudoionone hydrogenation in various
   solvents (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, toluene, benzene, and hexane).
   The intensity and selectivity of the process were shown to be associated
   with the nature of a solvent and the levels of rhodium in the complex. 
   The catalytic systems proposed may be useful in selective hydrogenation
   when vitamin E is synthesized.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of crop sequences and tillage practices on diseases of winter
   wheat were examined.  Three-year sequences of continuous wheat,
   soybean-wheat-wheat, corn-barley-wheat, and alfalfa-alfalfa-wheat were
   produced under conventional, minimum, and zero tillage.  The rotations
   followed mixed barley and oats.  Crop sequence and tillage treatment
   affected severity of individual wheat diseases but did not markedly
   affect the total severity of foliar disease.  Tan spot (caused by
   Pyrenophora tritici-repentis) and septoria nodorum blotch (caused by
   Phaeosphaeria nodorum) were increased and septoria tritici blotch
   (caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola) was suppressed in wheat after
   wheat under minimum or zero tillage.  The opposite occurred when wheat
   followed other crops in all tillage treatments or followed wheat under
   conventional tillage.  Numbers of pseudothecia of P. tritici-repentis on
   wheat residues per m2 soil generally increased with reduction in
   tillage, but numbers of pseudothecia/g residue increased then decreased
   as density of crop residue increased.  Density of pycnidia of M.
   graminicola on overwintered wheat leaves in April was greatest when
   wheat followed wheat under minimum or zero tillage and was inversely
   related to severity of septoria tritici bloctch in the upper canopy in
   June.  Incidence of take-all was greatest in wheat after wheat.  Powdery
   mildew was more severe in wheat following soybean than in wheat after
   wheat.  Yields of wheat, averaged across tillage treatments, were about
   20\% lower in continuous wheat than in wheat following other crops. 
   Stunting and bare patches in wheat plots generally coincided with dense
   accumulations of wheat or barley residues on the soil.}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1960s the Japanese government has encouraged Japanese firms to
   invest in overseas production and primary processing of minerals and
   energy, in order to enhance Japan's access to raw materials.  This
   investment peaked in the early 1970s and remained relatively high until
   the early 1980s, when it dropped.  This policy and reduced investment
   had their effects, as the share of imports from direct investment based
   sources in Japan's total imports rose significantly for copper,
   aluminium, iron ore and coking coal by the mid-1970s.  However, this
   share has declined since the early 1980s (liquefied gas and oil were
   exceptions) as overall imports of these commodities increased and
   Japanese investors found more attractive alternatives.  In the case of
   oil, the share remained low, around 10\%, throughout the entire period.}},

Abstract = {{Maturing brook trout were exposed to pH 4.5 at the beginning of the
   rapid oocyte development phase in mid-June. The number of atretic
   follicles containing vitellogenic oocytes in acid-treated trout
   gradually increased with time, to exceed that of control fish on day 30,
   reaching a maximum (22-24\% of all vitellogenic oocytes) between days 45
   and 60 of acid exposure, before declining on day 73. Follicular atresia
   reduced the number of healthy vitellogenic oocytes in the acid-stressed
   fish to 59\% of controls by day 60. Plasma vitellogenin and estrogen
   levels were not consistently affected by acid exposure. During the first
   45 days of acid exposure, the mean weight of the healthy vitellogenic
   oocytes and the plasma levels of estrogen in the acid-exposed fish were
   at times significantly higher than those of control trout, but after day
   45 these differences were no longer observed. Ultrastructural
   morphometry showed that secretory activity of the gonadotropes in the
   female acid-stressed brook trout was suppressed. Throughout the
   experimental period, the acid-exposed trout showed various symptoms
   characteristic of acid stress, such as elevated ACTH and cortisol
   secretion, hyperglycemia, acidosis, and hyponatremia. Food intake was
   reduced to 14\% of the control value. These results suggest that the
   disruptive physiological changes and (or) reduced nutritional status
   associated with acid stress are responsible for the reduction in
   activity of the gonadotropes and oocyte atresia.}},

Abstract = {{A number of fibroblastoid synovial cell lines have been established from
   rheumatoid joints.  These cell lines were shown to express the
   interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene constitutively, and exposure of these cells to
   5 ng/ml of recombinant human interleukin 1-BETA (IL-1-BETA) increased
   IL-6 gene expression.  Other recombinant human lymphokines, namely
   interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and
   granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor had no enhancing effect
   on IL-6 gene expression.  Dexamethasone added to the cultures at 10(-7)
   M concentration suppressed the constitutive expression of the IL-6 gene.
   At a concentration of 10(-5)M, dexamethasone partially suppressed the
   IL-1 enhanced expression of IL-6.  The IL-6 gene probe also hybridized
   to RNA from unfractionated synovial fluid cells, peripheral blood B
   cells of patients with rheumatoid cells but not Epstein-Barr virus
   transformed peripheral blood T cells of patients with rheumatoid
   arthritis.  Our results suggest that in rheumatoid arthritis, synovial
   fibroblasts actively participate in joint inflammation by lumphokine
   production.  The coexpression of both IL-1 and IL-6 by one synovial
   fibroblast line suggests a mechanism for the perpetuation of synovitis.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the compression setting ratio on the capsule fill
   weight variability has been assessed for a series of particle size
   fractions of Avicel, calcium carbonate, lactose, maize starch and Starch
   1500, on a capsule filling simulator.  For most of the systems tested,
   the most uniform weights were achieved when no compression was applied
   to the powder during the filling process.  The finest particle size
   fractions of lactose and maize starch do however require some
   compression to aid powder retention.  For the larger particle size
   fractions, providing high compression settings could induce the piston
   to jam in the nozzle resulting in failure to fill a capsule at all.  The
   degree of coating of the wall of the nozzle increased with decreasing
   particle size and increasing compression setting.  Lactose produced the
   greatest degree of coating of the nozzle.  For nozzles pretreated by a
   running in process to induce nozzle coating, most powders behaved in the
   same manner as those which had started with a clean nozzle.  The
   exception was lactose, which could not be effectively filled using a
   pretreated nozzle, due to severe binding of powder to the nozzle wall
   inducing jamming of the piston within the nozzle.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1990}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{909-923}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{(1) Two types of simulated swards were constructed to investigate
   spatiotemporal changes and the importance of species interactions in
   creating and maintaining pattern among six grassland species:  Lolium
   perenne, Agrostis capillaris, Holcus lanatus, Poa trivialis, Cynosurus
   cristatus and Trifolium repens.
   (2) Neighbour effects were studied in mosaic swards consisting of twenty
   hexagonal patches.  Each hexagonal patch was sown with a single species.
   A species never had itself as a neighbour.  To study the colonization of
   empty space, each of six trapezia, surrounding an empty central hexagon,
   was sown with one of the same six species.  After twenty-seven months,
   the swards were destructively harvested and the contents of each hexagon
   separated into species.
   (3) Each species had its own rate and scale of change.  Trifolium was by
   far the most mobile species.  Only 20\% of its biomass was in native
   hexagons, i.e. in which it had been sown.  The stoloniferous grasses
   Agrostis and Poa divided their biomass about equally between native
   hexagons and those in which they were not sown.  The stoloniferous
   species were most effective in colonizing empty space.  Cynosurus was
   the least mobile species with almost 90\% of its biomass in native
   hexagons.
   (4) The hypothesis that the spread of species into adjacent hexagons is
   independent of the specific identity of neighbours was falsified. 
   Evidence for cyclic regeneration on the scale of the patch as postulated
   by Watt was not found.  In contrast, each species was invaded to the
   same relative extent by all the others.  The decreasing order of
   preference of neighbours was established as:  Trifolium > Poa > Lolium >
   Cynosurus > Holcus > Agrostis.  It is suggested that pattern in plant
   communities cannot be viewed on a single spatial or temporal scale.}},

Abstract = {{A layered stream is a list of data structures H {*} Ts where Ts is a
   layered stream containing all possible tails for head H. One performance
   advantage is the ability to eagerly construct a partial solution by
   binding head H before the tails Ts are known. This increases potential
   parallelism. A disadvantage of this facility is that eagerly binding H
   can cause consumers of the layered stream to do extra computation if in
   fact Ts is uncompletable. In addition, the layered streams can grow very
   large, the bulk of which is garbage. To combat this space inefficiency,
   eager term construction can be restricted, thereby reducing parallelism.
   In this paper we show the trade-offs between potential parallelism,
   execution time, space and time complexity, for a group of benchmarks
   implemented with layered streams and streams. We also compare these
   algorithms to the related paradigms of candidates/noncandidates and
   fused generate \& test.}},

Abstract = {{We developed the Nursing Home Life-Space Diameter (NHLSD) as a measure
   of the extent and frequency of mobility among skilled nursing facility
   (SNF) residents.  Intrarater and interrater reliability was assessed in
   a small sample of SNF residents.  The means and ranges of NHLSD scores,
   the characteristics associated with NHLSD score, and the association
   between NHLSD score and other functional characteristics were then
   determined among 398 residents of 12 SNFs.  NHLSD scores ranged from 0,
   signifying bed- or chair-bound to 50, signifying leaving the facility
   daily.  The correlation between NHLSD scores by two nurses was 0.951;
   the correlation between scores at two points of time was 0.922.  Mean
   score among the 398 subjects was 27.05.  Decreased vision, presence of a
   neurologic disease, and arthritis were all associated with lower NHLSD
   score.  Mobility (NHLSD) score was moderately correlated with other
   functional characteristics such as participation in social activities
   (Spearman's correlation = + 0.565).  The NHLSD, which represents a
   simple and reliable assessment of mobility among SNF residents, could be
   used to assess the effect of interventions and to monitor changes among
   SNF residents.}},

Abstract = {{Loratadine is a highly selective, long-acting, H-1-receptor agonist.  In
   a randomized double-blind, crossover study, we evaluated the effects of
   loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, and placebo administered once daily for 3 days
   on the skin-wheal responses to histamine, the airway responses to
   inhaled histamine and methacholine, and the skin-wheal and airway
   responses to allergen in 12 subjects with asthma.  There was no evidence
   of a bronchodilator action 3 hours after a third oral dose.  In the
   airway, the geometric mean of the provocative concentration of histamine
   causing a 20\% fall in FEV, after placebo or loratadine, 10 and 20 mg,
   was 0.68 mg/ml, 2.71 mg/ml (p, not significant), and 5.96 mg/ml (p <
   0.05), respectively.  The concentration ratios (value after active
   treatment/value after placebo) for loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, were 5.1 (p
   < 0.05) and 13.4 (p < 0.05).  Neither dose of loratadine had any
   significant effect on the methacholine dose-response relationship.  In
   the skin, loratadine also displaced the histamine log-concentration
   response curves to the right with concentration ratios of 4.7 and 7.6,
   respectively.  Loratadine, 10 and 20 mg, had no protective effect on the
   early or late-phase bronchoconstrictor responses to inhaled allergen. In
   the skin, loratadine, 20 mg, significantly inhibited the mean wheal area
   to allergen.  Thus, in the dose regimens studied, although loratadine is
   a moderately potent and selective H-1 antagonist in the skin and
   airways, it failed to attenuate the early and late airway responses to
   inhaled allergen.}},

Abstract = {{The calcium channel antagonists are a heterogeneous group of drugs
   acting on one class of voltage-dependent channel. Their modes and sites
   of actions are reviewed in this historical perspective and placed in the
   context of the cellular events underlying homeostasis. Caclium channel
   antagonists should be regarded as a subset of a large family of Ca2+
   modulators, agents that block or activate functions at a variety of
   control loci for Ca2+ homeostasis. In a number of important respects,
   the CA2+ channel may be viewed as a pharmacologic receptor that defines
   the existence of specific drug binding sites and their regulation by
   homologous and heterologous influences. We describe the factors that
   define the selectivity of action of channel antagonists, with particular
   emphasis on state-dependent interactions controlled by voltage-modulated
   drug interactions, and discuss future developments in CA2+ channel
   ligands, emphasizing the contributions of molecular biology and the
   development of more specific and selective agents.}},

   size exclusion membranes with molecular weight cut offs of approximately
   1000, 3500 and 12000 dalton were used.  The permeation coefficients of
   drugs through 1000 MW cut off were linearly related to the partition
   coefficients of the drugs in the oil-water-cosurfactant mixture.  A
   maximum appeared using 3500 or 12000 MW cut off.  The behaviour was
   related to the presence of aggregate species, larger than 1000 MW but
   smaller than 3500 MW, which increased the amount of diffusible drug.
   The release of steroid hormones from microemulsions constituted of fixed
   amounts of IPM, AOT, water and butanol, isobutanol, cyclopentanol,
   cyclohexanol or tert. amyl alcohol as cosurfactant, was then studied.  A
   correlation between the partition coefficients and the permeation

   volume fraction of disperse phase and the viscosity of the
   microemulsions appear to affect the release.}},

Abstract = {{After an initial period of adaptation to 20 min per day of limited water
   availability, male and female Wistar rats were allowed access to water
   or a 0.1\% sodium-saccharin solution.  Saccharin exposures were followed
   by the subcutaneous administration of 0, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg cocaine for
   different groups of rats.  Four pairings of the saccharin solution with
   cocaine administration resulted in a consistent decrease in saccharin
   consumption only in female subjects injected with the largest dose of
   cocaine (20 mg/kg).  Choice testing in which subjects could choose
   between two drinking tubes, one containing water, the other one
   containing the saccharin solution, was then conducted during extinction.
   During four of such experimental sessions, subjects which had previously
   been injected with vehicle mostly consumed the saccharin solution or
   showed a position bias.  Conditioned taste aversions were not only
   observed in the group of female subjects injected with 20 mg/kg cocaine,
   but also in males previously treated with 20 mg/kg cocaine.  In
   addition, compared to vehicle control groups, males and females injected
   with 5 and 10 mg/kg cocaine tended to avoid the saccharin solution in
   favor of regular water.  It is suggested that previous failures to
   obtain consistent cocaine-mediated taste aversions may have been a
   function of the experimental procedures used to assess cocaine's
   efficacy in inducing conditioned taste aversions.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term tolerance of zidovudine treatment was retrospectively analysed
   in 97 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex.  After one year of
   treatment 68\% and after two years 87\% of the patients had had at least
   one dose adjustment during their course of therapy.  Myelotoxicity was
   the most common cause (58\% of all cases) of dose reductions and therapy
   interruptions (dose adjustments).  At the time of the first dose
   adjustment 33 patients (34\%) were suffering from anaemia (Hb < 6.0
   g/dl), 20 patients (21\%) from leukopenia (leukocytes < 1.5 x 10(9), and
   10 patients (10\%) from thrombocytopenia (thrombocytes < 75 x 10(9). 
   Fifty-six patients (57\%) needed one or more blood transfusions during
   therapy.  The median time from the start of therapy to the time of the
   first dose adjustment was 14 (range:  2-64) weeks in patients who had a
   first dose adjustment because of anaemia without co-existing leukopenia
   or thrombocytopenia, and 37 (range:  6-85) weeks in patients who had a
   first dose adjustment because of leukopenia without co-existing anaemia
   or thrombocypenia (p = 0.01).  Peripheral blood CD4 positive lymphocyte
   counts less-than-or-equal-to 100/mm3, anaemia, and CDC classification
   IV-Cl at the start of treatment were associated with a need for an early
   dose modification or blood transfusion rather than the need for dose
   modification per se.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve the production of the cytotoxic lignan
   podophyllotoxin, seven precursors from the phenylpropanoid-routing and
   one related compound were fed to cell suspension cultures derived from
   the rhizomes of Podophyllum hexandrum Royle.  These cell cultures were
   able to convert only coniferin into podophyllotoxin, maximally a 12.8
   fold increase in content was found.  Permeabilization using isopropanol,
   in combination with coniferin as a substrate, did not result in an extra
   increase in podophyllotoxin accumulation.  Concentrations of isopropanol
   exceeding 0.5\% (v/v) were found to be rather toxic for suspension
   growth cells of P. hexandrum.  When coniferin was fed in presence of
   such isopropanol concentrations, beta-glucosidase activity was still
   present, resulting in the formation of the aglucon coniferyl alcohol. 
   In addition, podophyllotoxin was released into the medium under these
   permeabilization conditions.  Entrapment of P. hexandrum cells in
   calcium-alginate as such or in combination with the feeding of
   biosynthetic precursors, did not improve the podophyllotoxin production.
   Cell-free medium from suspension cultures at later growth stages
   incubated with coniferin, resulted in the synthesis of the lignan
   pinoresinol.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys to detect foci of schistosomiasis mansoni endemicity in the
   Dominican Republic were carried out from 1982 to 1987 and showed that
   the disease is far more widely distributed in the country than
   previously thought.  New foci (San Rafael del Yuma, Batey Palo Bonito,
   Maicillo, Nisibon and additional barrios in the city of Higuey) were
   found in the eastern provinces, and other completely new foci
   (Bayaguana, Sabana Rey (Cotui) and Jarabacoa) in the center of the
   country and in the National District (Guerra) were also detected. 
   Prevalence rates in the various barrios (sections) of the city of Higuey
   varied between 7.4\% and 24.6\%, whereas they were 10.2\% in Maicillo,
   7.8\% in El Valle and 9.9\% in El Seibo.  The intensity of infection was
   very low as judged by eggs per gram of feces.  Serodiagnosis using the
   circumoval precipitin test raised the infection rate from that indicated
   by stool examination, as in Maicillo, or both results were equal, as in
   Las Palmillas.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study was to determine the effect of selection for
   large root dimension on root and shoot characteristics of an Italian
   variety of Lolium perenne L. (cv. `Vejo').  Two cycles of recurrent
   restricted phenotypic selection (RRPS) were carried out in 1983 and 1984
   at Perugia (Italy).  In each cycle, 20 out of 1,500 plants were selected
   and intercrossed under isolation.  In 1985, 120 plants from `Vejo
   selected' and an equal number of plants from `Vejo' initial seed-lot
   were grown hydroponically for 92 days; at the end of the experiment, the
   plants were measured for their number of leaves and stems, leaf length,
   length of the longest root, root volume and shoot and root dry weight.
   Sufficient genetic variability existed among plants of cv. `Vejo' to
   allow highly significant responses to selection for root dimension (+25
   \% in root length, +39 \% in root volume, +67 \% in root dry weight and
   +31 \% in root:  shoot dry weight ratio).  Furthermore, two cycles of
   RRPS for root dimension did not show negative responses of the
   aboveground parts of the plant.}},

Abstract = {{A method is described for the improved detection of bean yellow mosaic
   virus (BYMV) in gladioli leaves. Specific sequences of BYMV RNA, present
   in total RNA extracts of infected plants were detected following
   amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The viral RNA was
   initially reverse-transcribed into cDNA, then specific sequences were
   amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotides as primers. Detectable
   amounts of virus RNA in BYMV-infected plant tissue by PCR were
   approximately three to four orders of magnitude lower as compared with
   those detectable by ELISA and molecular hybridisation. Combining PCR
   with molecular hybridisation (using a P-32-labelled transcript of viral
   sequences as a probe), further increased the sensitivity of this method
   to a gain of four to five orders of magnitude as compared with direct
   molecular hybridisation, and enabled the detection of up to single
   picogram quantities of the virus.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional organization of the spinal nerve roots at the
   level of the conus medullaris has not been described previously, to our
   knowledge.  In this study, we used a newly developed technique of in
   situ fixation and embedding to define the cross-sectional anatomy at the
   level of the conus medullaris in ten fresh human cadavera.  A highly
   organized overlapping pattern of nerve roots was demonstrated in all
   specimens.  The nerve roots form a peripheral rim around the spinal cord
   at the levels of the tenth and eleventh and the eleventh and twelfth
   thoracic intervertebral discs.  More caudally, the cord diminishes in
   size and the nerve roots predominate.  The most cephalad roots lie
   laterally, with the motor roots ventral to their sensory counterparts. 
   The more caudad roots overlap toward the midline, and the motor and
   sensory portions of each root are separated by spinal cord tissue.  An
   intricate web of arachnoid membrane holds the nerve roots in a fixed
   relationship to each other.
   CLINICAL RELEVANCE:  This previously undescribed three-dimensional
   anatomy at the level of the conus medullaris may aid in the
   understanding of neurological deficits secondary to trauma to the
   thoracolumbar junction, high lumbar-disc herniations (such as those at
   the first and second lumbar intervertebral disc), and tumors in this
   region.}},

Abstract = {{In the course of the magnetic storm of 4 September 1984, after an
   inverse sudden impulse (SI), geomagnetic pulsations in the Pc5-frequency
   range were observed at magnetometer stations in the local evening
   sector.  They occurred at L-values of approximately 6, and lasted for
   several hours, their period increasing from about 320 to 550 s.  In this
   study, two events of enhanced activity are discussed in some detail. 
   During the 16:00 U.T. event, a favourable position of the AMPTE/IRM
   spacecraft allows conjugate observations in the Northern and Southern
   Hemispheres and in the magnetosphere.  This constellation permits a
   precise determination of the wave node.  During a later intensification
   around 18:00 U.T., the AMPTE/CCE spacecraft near local noon monitored
   poloidal waves, obviously driving the pulsations on the ground. 
   Generally, the observations are consistent with the theory of field line
   resonance.  They are interpreted as being excited by pressure variations
   in the solar wind.  The hydromagnetic cavity mode is assumed to link the
   magnetopause surface motions to the field line resonances.}},

Abstract = {{Systematics in magnetovolume behavior of fcc 3d-alloys are revealed when
   their respective physical properties are plotted versus the electron
   concentration e/a.  The results can qualitatively be understood within
   recent band calculations, showing metamagnetism to occur at threshold
   values e/a almost-equal-to 8.6 and almost-equal-to 7.7, when the alloys
   order ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically, respectively.  From
   the e/a dependence of martensite transition temperatures, M(s), we infer
   that the structural fcc-fct (or fcc-bcc) phase transitions occuring just
   below the e/a thresholds are magnetically driven, and show that
   martensitic transformations can be explained by using the results of the
   band calculations mentioned above.  Similarity to structural
   transformations in non-magnetic Hume-Rothery alloys is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Luminescence spectra of PbI2 grown from the vapor phase have been
   investigated at 2 K.  A broad emission is observed in the energy region
   below the exciton absorption edge where an absorption tail spreads
   toward lower energy.  Measurements of the luminescence decay reveal that
   the decay curve consists of a fast and a slow components.  The slow
   component is supposed to be the recombination of donor-acceptor pairs. 
   The fast component is attributed, from its spectral profile and the
   dependence of the decay time on the emission energy, to radiative decay
   of excitons localized by potential fluctuations caused by lattice
   imperfections.  The sample dependence of the luminescence is briefly
   discussed in relation to the reflection spectra.}},

Abstract = {{A stable, annual production of Japanese apricot fruit has hitherto been
   desired in Japan. To realize this target, the present investigation was
   conducted to obtain possible clues. For that purpose, the internal
   constituents, amino acid, sugar, and starch, were determined
   quantitatively in shoots collected from different aged branches of
   young, adult, and old trees. Bearing spurs, 4 approximately 6 cm in
   length, possessed higher levels of these substances in comparison with
   longer bearing shoots or succulent water sprouts. Amino acid content of
   bearing shoots borne on old trees was higher than that from young or
   adult trees. Sucrose and starch contents also increased with tree age.
   Spurs which are highly productive, and bearing shoots sampled from old
   tree, had higher levels of amino acid, sugar and starch. Hence, there
   was a close relationship between productivity and amino acid, sugar, or
   starch content. Current shoots gathered from three-or four-year-old
   lateral branches which set large sized fruits had higher amino acid
   content than did the other different aged branches. In conclusion,
   three-or four-year-old lateral branches were determined to be the most
   productive units in Japanese apricot trees.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of shear-thinning rheology on the spatial growth of waves in
   multilayered flow down an inclined plane is modeled, utilizing the
   Carreau viscosity constitutive equation.  It is shown that waves
   associated with the free surface propagate as if they were in a
   Newtonian system, where the viscosity is some average of the varying
   viscosities in the shear-thinning layer.  This averaging is due to the
   global thicknesses.  In contrast, waves that are associated with the
   interfaces between adjacent fluid layers are largely affected by the
   local interfacial viscosities; wave propagation is not governed by some
   average Newtonian viscosity across the layer.  It is found that
   shear-thinning rheology can either increase or decrease the growth of
   waves associated with a fluid-fluid interface, compared with a purely
   Newtonian case.}},

Abstract = {{Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encodes a novel enzyme activity, the
   alkaline nuclease, whose precise role in the viral replication cycle
   remains obscure. The alkaline nuclease gene corresponds to the UL12 open
   reading frame, which is predicted to encode a protein of 626 amino acid
   residues. We describe the isolation and characterization of a null
   mutant of the gene for the viral alkaline nuclease in which 917 bp from
   the N-terminal half of the gene (corresponding to residues 70 to 375)
   were deleted and replaced by the insertional mutagen ICP6::lacZ. The
   resulting mutant virus, AN-1, was propagated in helper cells (S22) which
   express the wild-type version of the alkaline nuclease gene. Mutant AN-1
   growth in Vero cells is severely restricted, although small amounts of
   infectious virus are produced. On the other hand, wild-type levels of
   viral DNA and late viral proteins are expressed in virus AN-1-infected
   Vero cells. These results indicate that the HSV-1 alakline nuclease gene
   product is not essential for viral DNA synthesis but may play a role in
   the processing or packaging of viral DNA into infectious virions.
   Possible roles in the viral infectious cycle will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Although dust storms are quite frequent in the Canadian Prairies, no
   scientific studies of the nature of dust storms of this area exist, to
   the authors' knowledge.  This work is a preliminary step in depicting
   temporal and spatial variations of dust storms in the Canadian Prairies.
   Dust storms occur at least once to as often as five times per year, on
   average, in the agricultural prairies.  This frequency indicates the
   risk of occurrence of the various impacts of dust storms, such as
   serious soil erosion.  Dust storm frequencies exhibit a pronounced peak
   in the spring and a weak secondary peak in August.  The spatial pattern
   of dust storms indicates a low risk of occurrence in the northern
   agricultural prairies and the  highest risk in the south central
   prairies. Knowledge of these patterns in space and time should
   facilitate the control of avoidance or such impacts of dust storms as
   wind erosion of soils, crop damage, air pollution, and general
   environmental degradation.  Studies should be carried out to further
   investigate relationships of climatic factors with dust storms as well
   as their linkages with other environmental aspects.}},

Abstract = {{During development in the cochlea, NCAM is present on all neuronal
   systems - radial fibres, inner spiral bundle, inner pillar bundle
   (described by Sobkowicz \& Emmerling, 1989), and outer spiral fibres. 
   In cochleae from E17 mice, NCAM-positive puncta, possibly associated
   with growth cones, dot the area of the inner spiral bundle.  The region
   overlying the basilar membrane is also NCAM positive.  Until about P7,
   NCAM immunoreactivity surrounds the inner and outer hair cells.  During
   the second postnatal week, NCAM no longer covers the hair cell surfaces.
   At this time, NCAM is present on the inner spiral and inner pillar
   bundles.  In the outer hair cell region, immunoreactivity concentrates
   in neuronal endings with `Y'-like or `dot'-like appearances typical of
   cholinergic efferents.  At a time when neuronal fibres are regenerating
   in the cochlea of the Bronx waltzer mutant mouse, many NCAM-positive
   puncta dot the regions of the inner spiral bundle and inner spiral
   sulcus, suggesting that these puncta correspond to growth cones.  In
   organotypic culture, hair cells and nerve fibres retain their
   immunoreactivity up to 7 days.  In conclusion, NCAM is present on the
   surfaces of neurons and on their cochlear targets at the time when
   nerve-target recognition is proceeding.  NCAM disappears from targets
   during the time of maturation of efferent synapses.  NCAM is also
   present along the growth path of the nerve fibres.  These studies
   suggest that NCAM is properly positioned in the cochlea for possible
   roles in axon guidance and nerve-target interactions.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate whether inhaled steroids modulate the airway response to
   different bronchoconstrictive stimuli, we studied 25 subjects with mild
   asthma with a double-blind, noncrossover design to compare the effect of
   a 3-week treatment with salbutamol (0.2 mg, four times a day {[}q.i.d.])
   and placebo (N = 11) to the effect of salbutamol (0.2 mg q.i.d.) and
   inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP, 0.5 mg q.i.d.) (N = 14).
   Airway response to histamine and methacholine was assessed as the
   provocative concentration (in milligrams per milliliter) necessary to
   increase the specific airway resistance (SR(aw)) (in centimeters of H2O
   times second) by 100\% (PC100 SR(aw)).  Airway response to
   hyperventilation of air and to hyperventilation of 0.75 ppm of sulfur
   dioxide (SO2) was determined as the provocative ventilation (in liters
   per minute) necessary to increase SR(aw) by 75\% (PV75 SR(aw)).
   Challenges were performed on separate days before and after treatment,
   and salbutamol inhalation was withheld at least 6 hours before each
   challenge.  Salbutamol and placebo did not change prechallenge baseline
   SR(aw) nor did they have any significant effect on the airway response
   to the stimuli.  Salbutamol and BDP decreased the mean prechallenge
   baseline SR(aw) (SEM) from 7.7 (0.37) to 5.9 (0.28) (p < 0.01) and
   significantly (p < 0.01) increased geometric mean (SEM) PC100 SR(aw) for
   histamine from 0.5 (1.42) to 0.9 (1.53) mg/ml; for metacholine, from 0.2
   (1.47) to 0.5 (1.51) mg/ml; and mean (SEM) PV75 SR(aw) for
   hyperventilation of air from 51.8 (2.32) to 58.4 (1.86) L/min.  In
   contrast, the change of PV75 SR(aw) during hyperventilation of SO2 from
   26.2 (2.29) to 31.4 (3.30) L/min was not significant.  Our observations
   confirm previously reported effects of inhaled steroids on metacholine
   and histamine challenges.  However, since BDP had no consistent effect
   on the SO2 hyperventilation test, we suggest that the efficacy of
   inhaled steroids depends on the nature of the provoking stimulus.}},

   IgG1 antibody enhanced the response to TNP-coupled bovine serum albumin.
   Moreover, C-activating IgG could enhance the antibody response in mice

Abstract = {{The effects of the administration of insulin and glucagon on the
   intraacinar heterotopy of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were
   investigated in male and female rat liver.  Insulin did not noticeably
   influence PEPCK activity or its acinar distribution, either in males or
   females.  But it affected the activities of glucose-6-phosphate
   dehydrogenase and malic enzyme.
   Glucagon in supraphysiological concentrations led to an induction of
   PEPCK activity.  Despite high glucagon concentration along the whole
   sinusoidal length, the inducing effect of glucagon was most pronounced
   in the periportal and intermediary parts of the acinus; thus indicating
   that there is no direct interrelationship between local glucagon
   concentration and PEPCK activity.  In both experiments blood glucose
   levels were kept fairly constant.}},

Abstract = {{The antioxidant activity of whole egg, egg albumen and egg yolk was
   estimated, and it was found that egg yolk had strong antioxidant
   activity on linoleate in an emulsion both with and without Fe2+.  The
   relationship between the antioxidant activity and the components of the
   egg yolk was also investigated.  The low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
   fraction of yolk had a very weak activity, the granule fraction having
   the strong antioxidant activity in egg yolk.  Phosvitin, a potent
   antioxidant, had weak activity in this system, but it was elevated by
   combining with the LDL fraction.  When egg yolk was heated at
   80-degrees-C for 30 min, its activity decreased.  These results suggest
   that egg yolk had an antioxidant effect on linoleate in emulsions with
   and without Fe2+, and that granules, and not LDL, were the strong
   antioxidant fraction of egg yolk.  Furthermore, it is suggested that
   both a phosvitin and native lipoprotein structure may be necessary for
   the antioxidant activity of the yolk granules.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemics of soybean rust (caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi) were studied
   in Taiwan by sequentially planting soybean cultivars G 8587 and TK 5 at
   weekly intervals in 1980 and 1981. For most planting dates, lesions were
   first observed at soybean growth stage V2 or V3 (unrolled leaf occurred
   at second or third nodes on main stem), indicating the presence of
   inoculum near the time of planting. The development of disease was
   affected by the growth of soybean, of which the growth periods varied
   from 83 days to 207 days for different planting dates. On the
   autumn-seeded crop, disease reached the maximum level 40-60 days after
   planting. On the summer-seeded crop, disease onset was 20-40 days later
   than that of spring- or autumn-seeded crop, and disease reached the
   maximum level 80-100 days after planting. Physiological days were used
   as a measure of biological time for both the soybean plant and the rust
   pathogen. Total leaf area per plant was closely described using plant
   physiological day as an independent variable with R2 greater than 0.88
   (n = 215-235). A disease model using physiological day of plant and
   physiological day of pathogen as independent variables was used to
   calculate the disease development with data pooled from all the
   plantings, and R2 = 0.69 (n = 696) for G 8587 and 0.75 (n = 589) for TK
   5. Defoliation was significantly explained with regression on disease
   severity (R2 = 0.625-0.809, P < 0.0001); however, error increased when
   disease severity was low. Estimation of yield loss using area under
   disease progress curve (AUDPC) as an independent variable resulted in a
   greater R2-value than using area under defoliation curve for each
   cultivar. The results were significantly improved when AUDPC adjusted
   for planting date effect was used as an independent variable for the
   regression.}},

Abstract = {{Macroporous, nonionic Amberlite XAD-8 resin was used for fractionation

   humic acid was adsorbed onto the resin at pH 3 and fractionated into
   four components by stepwise elution using universal buffers adjusted to
   pH 7, to pH 11, water, and 50\% ethanol.  The first component consists
   of a few structural subunits, assumed to be condensed aromatic rings
   with short aliphatic substituents and many carboxyl groups.  The second
   component was characterized by phenolic groups, and the third by
   relatively long aliphatic chains.  The fourth component consists of many
   structural subunits, assumed to be aromatic rings with long aliphatic
   substituents.  Analysis of the distribution of these components makes
   possible a new classification of humic acids.}},

Abstract = {{Thin films of Zr-N have been prepared by reactive ion beam sputtering.
   The relationship between film properties, such as structural, optical
   and electrical properties, and nitrogen gas pressure and ion beam is
   systematically investigated.  The film properties can be controlled not
   only by varying reactive gas pressure, nitrogen gas pressure, but also
   by varying sputtering ion beam current even at a constant nitrogen gas
   pressure.  The previously proposed model of a reactive sputtering
   mechanism for the Zr-O system, which takes into account the gettering
   action of Zr atoms and deals with the number of sputtered Zr atoms and
   O2 molecules, is expanded to a sputtering mechanism for the Zr-N system
   and discussed quantitatively.  The nitrogen partial pressures during
   sputtering calculated from the expanded model are compared with
   experimental results.  It is found that the calculated values agree well
   with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{The sintering temperature is important to attaining high performance
   properties for injection molded Fe-2Ni steel.  A high temperature
   promotes densification, which is beneficial to both strength and

   microstructural coarsening (enlarged austenite grain size and coarser
   pearlitic structure) that degrades the mechanical properties.  In this
   study, the optimum sintering temperature is in the range of
   1180...1200-degrees-C.  Post-sintering heat treatments provide a means
   of attaining both a high density and small scale microstructure.  It is
   shown in this study that optimal processing involves sintering the
   compact to a high density with proper carbon content, followed by oil or
   water quenching and tempering.  This sequence results in excellent

Abstract = {{A bed of particulate solids supported by an upward current of gas can be
   stirred at moderate power input per unit volume using thin horizontal
   rods mounted on a vertical shaft. The bed is fluidized, but bubbles are
   suppressed below a critical value of the fluidizing velocity. Stirring
   increases bed bulk density and reduces the minimum fluidizing velocity.
   Segregation in a stirred fluidized bed is enhanced with both flotsam and
   jetsam tracer particles, but the rate of segregation is reduced with
   flotsam tracers. The stirred fluidized bed may be useful as a device for
   dry separation of solids.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical and a computational model are introduced to study the
   micromechanical high strain-rate failure mechanisms of shear-strain
   localization in monocrystalline fcc structures.  A theoretical framework
   for a constitutive model for the dynamic finite plastic deformation of
   rate-dependent single fcc crystals is developed.  The micromechanics of
   plastic flow are based on a high strain-rate single crystal plasticity
   model and a visco-plastic power law.  The single crystal is subjected to
   far-field dynamic tensile strain-rates ranging from 100/s to 2000/s.  An
   explicit finite-element model is introduced for the integration of the
   numerically stiff visco-plastic constitutive relations.   The total
   deformation rate tensor is obtained by the central difference explicit
   integration of the equations of motion.  The plastic deformation rate
   tensor is obtained from the solution of an initial-value nonlinear
   problem for the resolved shear stresses.  In time intervals when the
   differential equations for the resolved shear stresses are not
   numerically stiff, the initial-value problem is integrated by the
   explicit fifth-order Runge-Kutta adaptive time-step method.  In time
   domains where the propagated error grows and the time-step must be
   restricted due to stability requirements, which is an indication of
   numerical stiffness, the initial-value problem is integrated by an
   ALPHA-stable method.  To correctly differentiate time-step reductions
   due to stability, from time-step reductions due to accuracy, a stiffness
   ratio is defined.   The present analysis corroborates experimental
   observations that high strain-rate shear-strain localization, in
   rate-dependent crystals, is a function of thermal and geometrical
   softening, overall strain-rates, strain hardening, strain-rate
   hardening, and strain-rate sensitivity.}},

   approx. 4 times larger than the native lipoprotein.  The complexes
   retained a degree of in vitro cytotoxic activity against P388 leukaemia
   cells but this was 10 times less than that of the free drug.  The
   complex was internalised by P388 cells via the LDL receptor pathway with
   a similar affinity for the receptor but a lower uptake and number of
   receptors per cell.  The results demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of
   the particular complex is not mediated through the LDL receptor pathway
   and that other drug uptake mechanisms must be operative in vitro.}},

   a superconducting sample the superconductivity was found to coexist with
   the magnetic ordering of Fe atoms at the Cu(1) sites.  In a
   semiconductor sample the Fe atoms at the Cu(1) sites become magnetically
   ordered at a temperature T(M) congruent-to 20 K.  This temperature
   decreases by 10 K upon transition to the superconducting state.}},

Abstract = {{The water quality of Lake Geneva has declined steadily since the 1960s,
   due to a continuous increase of external phosphorus loading.  Average P
   level in the lake increased steadily to a peak in 1979, and even 1981 in
   the case of P content in the trophogenic layer.  Since then, reduced
   external inputs related to the delayed effects of phosphorus removal
   from waste waters initiated many years previously has led to a decrease
   in P level, and resulted in present stabilization and even improvement
   in water quality.  Long-term changes in zooplankton abundance correspond
   quite closely to eutrophication level changes.  After increasing since
   the 1960s, maximum zooplankton biomass was recorded for the first time
   in 1971; a second main peak appeared in 1981 together with the highest
   eutrophication level.  Over the last seven years, zooplankton abundance
   has decreased continuously, while water transparency has decreased and
   phytoplankton production has remained at a high level.}},

Abstract = {{Up to now the water-sediment interface (WSI) has not been considered by
   limnologists and oceanographers as a theoretical frontier between two
   phases, but as a variable layer comprising the overlying bottom water,
   the superficial sediment, and the bioturbed sediment.  This
   heterogeneous benthic boundary layer forms a non-equilibrated assemblage
   of an aqueous phase, a mineral phase influencing the exchanges, and a
   dissolved gaseous phase regulating biological activity, detrital organic
   matter present as dissolved or adsorbed compounds and particles, and a
   living benthic community dominated by microorganisms.  Biological
   activity and the equilibrium between these components are linked to
   depth, bottom currents, primary production and allochtonous inputs of
   organic matter.   The settling rate of particulate matter in the water
   column, which depends on both the size and density of particles, is also
   an important factor.  Settled organic matter is broken down mainly by
   heterotrophic microorganisms.  In the first stage, dissolved or
   particulate matter is depolymerized by exoenzymes linked to the
   bacterial membrane.  Other heterotrophic organisms, like flagellates and
   ciliates, contribute to the activity of bacterial populations or to a
   modification of the physical and chemical characteristics of organic
   matter like macrofauna.  Bacterial activity in the WSI is one to two
   orders of magnitude higher than in overlying bottom water, depending on
   the density of the bacterial population, on the amount of available
   organic matter, and on the presence of predators grazing on bacteria and
   macrofauna and increasing oxygen and dissolved substrates.  The WSI is
   now considered as a sink for particulate matter and biopolymers, and/or
   as a sink or source for organic monomers and NH4+ depending on their
   concentrations.  As a result of its contribution to mineral and organic
   cycles, the WSI is a crossroad for exchanges between aqueous and
   sediment layer.  During the last decade, intensive work has been
   performed in this field, but progress has been slow due to the
   heterogeneity of the layer and the adsorptive properties of the mineral
   fraction.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of plastic form change (microscreep) in a broad class of
   as-quenched MGs at room temperature under tensile stresses which are by
   an order of magnitude smaller than the strength limit is found.  The
   main regularities are studied of the MG microcreep in a range of
   temperatures and stresses on the ``stress-deformation{''} curve which
   traditionally is considered absolutely elastic.  It is established that
   the character of the microcreep is determined by the quantity of the
   crystalline phase in the amorphous alloy.  An increase of the relative
   volume of the crystalline phase up to 5 to 10\% diminishes the rate at
   which the creep diminishes at room temperature in as-quenched MG samples
   by orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{A large-solid-angle, high-resolution, recoil mass spectrometer has been
   designed for use with heavy ion beams from the Holifield heavy-ion
   facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The design has been
   coordinated with the Gammasphere detector project such that the
   spectrometer will operate with this 110-element germanium detector array
   at its target or focal-plane positions with minimum loss of gamma-ray
   solid angle.  The spectrometer has been designed with the specific
   intention of using inverse kinematic reactions, and the special problems
   that this entails and their solutions are discussed.  The use of inverse
   kinematics tremendously enhances the capabilities of the spectrometer
   and selected examples will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Coulomb scattering of particles in an accelerated bunch, due to the
   longitudinal momentum distribution, leads to the creation of a
   contribution to the transverse emittance which adds to the natural
   emittance.  This process has been calculated for high energy linacs used
   in high energy e+e- linear colliders.  At beam energies of 500 GeV to 1
   TeV, it has been found that the effect is weak.}},

   dynamics for SOS type models, near a wall which favors spreading.  We
   first solve exactly the Gaussian model and discuss various asymptotic
   regimes.  This is only appropriate to partial wetting.  We then consider
   more general models.  Using local equilibrium and scaling arguments, we
   derive the shape of the dynamical profile and th speed of the precursor
   film which exists when the spreading coefficient is strictly positive. 
   Long-range potentials lead to a layered structure of the precursor film.
    We aslo consider the case of a meniscus in a capillary.}},

Abstract = {{Selenium acquisition by crops is of interest because it is an essential
   element for higher animals and because excessive levels are toxic to
   humans and livestock.  This research was conducted to test whether
   uptake by plants of an important organic Se compound, selenomethionine,
   occurred through a metabolically active process.  Selenomethionine
   absorption in 30-d-old wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings was
   measured by using a depletion method with two initial nutrient solution
   concentrations (0.5 and 1.0-mu-M) selenomethionine.  Observed uptake
   rates were functions of solution concentration and were not affected by
   initial concentration.  Uptake kinetics appeared to conform to the
   Michaelis-Menten function but the initial concentrations were too low to
   estimate either K(m) or V(max) (maximum uptake rate when carrier or
   permease is saturated).  Selenomethionine uptake was inhibited by a
   metabolic inhibitor, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and by anaerobic conditions. 
   Absorption resumed when aerobic conditions were restored to the
   anaerobic treatment.  Experimental evidence shows that wheat seedlings
   can acquire the biologically important organic Se compound,
   selenomethionine.  This acquistion is under metabolic control which
   further suggests that organic forms of Se must be considered as sources
   of plant available Se.}},

Abstract = {{Effectors for increasing the efficiency of DNA modification with the
   alkylating methylphosphonate analogues of oligodeoxyribonucleotides
   (MFAO) were suggested.  Oligodeoxyribonucleotide d(pC5A8ACAATG) used as
   a target DNA treated with alkylating derivatives of octathymidylate
   having alternating methylphosphonate and phosphodiester internucleotide
   bonds (both R(p)- and S(p)-individual diastereoisomers of MFAO were
   used) and bearing alkylating 4-(N-methyl-N-2-chloroethylamino)benzyl
   phosphoramide residue at the 3'-end.  The reactions were carried out in
   the presence of an effector, hexadeoxyribonucleotide derivative
   PhnNH(CH2)2NHpCATTGTpNH(CH2)2NHPhn bearing two
   N-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenazinium (Phn) residues at the 3'- and 5'-ends and
   being complementary to the part of the target DNA neighbouring with
   octaadenylate.  It was shown that T(m) of the duplex formed by the
   target DNA, octathymidylate and effector is by 7-13-degrees-C higher
   than in the absence of the effector, thus considerably increasing the
   efficiency of the intracomplex alkylation of the target (e. g., at
   40-degrees-C, the increase for the reagent based on the R(p)-isomer is
   sixfold).  Specificity of the target DNA modification by the MFAO
   alkylating derivatives in the presence of effector is same as with
   reagents based on oligodeoxyribonucleotides with natural internucleotide
   bonds.}},

   adopted, substantial problems still face policy analysts attempting to

   conclusion is demonstrated through a detailed examination of the

Abstract = {{A two-stage defense response was induced in the freshwater snail
   Planorbarius corneus by stimulating the head.  It consisted of the shell
   being rapidly lowered over the head and foot followed by the snail
   gradually withdrawing into its shell.  These movements are performed by
   contracting the columellar muscle.  Motoneurons of the columellar muscle
   were identified in the cerebral, parietal, and pedal ganglia. 
   Stimulating the lip nerve was found to induce 2-stage excitation in
   motoneurons (responsible for the 2-stage muscular contraction) in
   preparations of central nervous system with the columellar muscle
   attached.  The same 2-stage motoneuronal excitation can also occur
   spontaneously.  This implies that defense reaction in the cell is at
   least partially a ``fixed action{''} underlying a central mechanism or
   program and triggered by afferent stimuli.  Activation of the central
   mechanism of defense response can also induce depolarization in certain
   columellar muscle motoneurons.  This points to the existence of a
   feedback between neurons of the central mechanism and motoneurons.}},

Abstract = {{The duration of antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningitis is always a

   meningitis were treated for 4 or 5 days, 16 of 22 Haemophilus influenzae
   and 4 of 6 pneumococcal meningitis were treated for 7 days without
   increase in neurologic sequelae.  A return of blood CRP levels to normal
   values was observed in all these patients simultaneously.  Thus, CRP
   seems to be a good biological parameter for discussing treatment
   discontinuation.  Furthermore, in some complications such as subdural
   effusion, a new increase of CRP levels was observed after the 5th day. 
   A sequential follow-up of CRP levels at days J0, 5, 7, 10, seems a very
   useful tool for management of bacterial meningitis.}},

Abstract = {{Relations between either the point- or beam-averaged effective
   reflectivity, Z(e), and surface rain rate, R, are determined by a
   probability matching method similar to that of Calheiros and Zawadzki,
   and Rosenfeld.  The cumulative density functions (CDF) of reflectivity
   and rain rate are matched at pairs of R(i), Z(i) which give the same
   percentile contribution.  One obtains range dependent Z(e)-R relations
   by stratifying the Z(e) data by range.  Truncation of the Z(e)
   distribution by too large a threshold causes the threshold rain rate
   retrieved from the radar data to exceed that in the matching gage
   distribution.  Forcing a match between the mean rate measured by the
   gages and those retrieved by use of a set of trial Z(e)-R equations
   provides for the adjustment of the final Z(e)-R relation and compensates
   for the truncation.  The radar retrieved CDFs of rain rate then
   replicate the CDF of gage measured rates nicely.  In the case of GATE
   the probability matching scheme produces a Z(e)-R relation that agrees
   with the bias adjusted relation of Hudlow et al. when one accounts for
   the approximate inverse relation between the effective reflectivity and
   beamwidth.  The range dependence of Z(e)-R manifests the slope of the
   vertical reflectivity profile with height and the usual decrease in
   beamfilling with range, and therefore depends upon storm type.  The
   method also implicitly includes climatological variations of drop size
   distribution and rain rate with height due to a variety of physical
   factors.  Because of the sensitivity of the Z(e)-R relation to beamwidth
   and viewing angle, it can not be transferred either to airborne or
   spaceborne radars.  It it notable that the climatologically tuned Z(e)-R
   may be applied to smaller space-time domains than those for which they
   were developed as long as the PDF of Z(e) closely approximates that for
   which the relation was developed.  This occurs in tropical regimes and
   elsewhere when the day-to-day storms resemble the climatically typical
   storm.  This is the reason for the success of the area-time integral
   methods of Doneaud and Rosenfeld et al.}},

Abstract = {{Secretory component (SC) binding assays which detect polymeric IgA
   (pIgA) in serum were used to measure serum antigliadin pIgA and total
   pIgA in patients with coeliac disease.  Total IgA antigliadin antibody
   in serum and intestinal fluid was measured by enzyme linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  The relationship of pIgA antibody to
   dietary gluten and the antigliadin IgA antibody in intestinal fluid was
   examined.
   Twenty-nine serum samples were assayed, twelve from patients ingesting
   gluten and seventeen from patients who had excluded gluten from their
   diet for 6 months.  Eight of these were paired samples from 4 adults on
   and off gluten.  In addition, paired samples of both intestinal fluid
   and serum were obtained from 7 children on and off gluten.
   Polymeric IgA antibody to gliadin was detected in 11 of 12 subjects on
   gluten but in only 3 of 17 who had excluded gluten.  Three of the four
   adults from whom paired serum samples were obtained had pIgA
   antigliadin, but only while on gluten.  Three of the seven children in
   whom intestinal and serum antibody were assayed had pIgA to gliadin,
   which could not be detected after exclusion of gluten, although their
   intestinal antibody level remained elevated.  There was no change in
   total pIgA level with diet although the levels were higher than those
   seen in normal subjects.
   We conclude that pIgA antibody to gliadin is frequently found in the
   serum of coeliac patients ingesting gluten.  It disappears with gluten
   elimination at a time when the IgA antigliadin antibody in intestinal
   fluid has not altered.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted on a sandy soil in Niger to evaluate the
   agronomic effectiveness of various P fertilizers for millet production
   during 1985 to 1987. The P fertilizers tested were two finely ground
   phosphate rocks (PR) indigenous to Niger (Tahoua and Parc W rocks), PR
   partially acidulated with H2SO4 at 50\% acidulation level (PAPR), single
   superphosphate (SSP), and triple superphosphate (TSP). In 1985,
   application rates were 0, 6.5, 13.0, and 19.5 kg P ha-1 for each of the
   P fertilizers. In 1986, half of the plots received the same rates of P
   as in 1985 and half of the plots received no additional P. In 1987, P
   additions were repeated only in half of the plots that received P during
   1986. A significant (P = 0.05) millet response to P was observed in all
   the trials. The major findings of this study were: (i) finely ground
   Tahoua PR was more effective than Parc W PR because of its higher
   reactivity and was 82 to 91\% as effective as SSP for millet production
   in both the initial and two subsequent seasons; (ii) partial acidulation
   of Parc W PR can significantly increase its agronomic effectiveness in
   the first year, but not in terms of residual effect; (iii) partial
   acidulation was not a desirable technology for increasing the
   effectiveness of Tahoua PR, because its high Fe2O3 plus Al2O3 content
   resulted in a product containing relatively low amounts of water-soluble
   P; and (iv) over a period of 3 yr, one initial application of a large
   dose of P fertilizer was found to be more effective than three small
   annual applications in terms of total grain production.}},

Abstract = {{We examined rate of development to alevin hatching and fry emergence,
   embryo and alevin survival, and alevin and fry size for five Pacific
   salmon species.  There was little difference among values for hatching
   and emergence time predicted by a modified thermal sums model, power law
   model (log-inverse Belehradek), or quadratic model.  Coho salmon
   Oncorhynchus kisutch had the fastest rates of development to hatching
   and emergence of the five species investigated; rankings for the other
   species depended upon temperature range.  Coho salmon embryos had the
   highest survival rates at low incubation (1.5-degrees-C) temperatures. 
   Embryos of pink salmon O. gorbuscha had the lowest survival at
   temperatures less than 4-degrees-C.  For all five species, incubation
   temperature was the more important factor in determining alevin length,
   and egg size was the more important factor in determining alevin weight.
   Egg weight was a major determinant of fry weight at emergence.  Rates of
   development to hatching and emergence, and alevin and fry size, differed
   by species in response to changes in temperature.  Coho salmon alevins
   and fry were proportionately larger at 4-degrees-C than at 8-degrees-C
   or 12-degrees-C, but alevins and fry of pink salmon and chum salmon O.
   keta were largest at 8-degrees-C.  Variation in development characters
   of Pacific salmon reflected adaptations to each species' life history
   pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous axial and torsional oscillations of a rigid disk attached
   to an elastomeric shaft are investigated.  Five cases are solved
   exactly.  The uncoupled, small amplitude axial and torsional
   oscillations of the disk are investigated for neo-Hookean and
   Mooney-Rivlin shafts with static stretch.  The finite torsional
   vibration of the load superimposed on a static stretch of the shaft is
   studied for the Mooney-Rivlin model.  Solutions for both small and
   finite amplitude, uniaxial vibrations of the body superimposed on a
   pretwisted neo-Hookean shaft with static stretch are derived.  Simple
   bounds on the period for the finite motion are provided; and various
   universal frequency relations for neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin
   materials are identified.
   Finally, the main problem of finite, uniaxial vibrations accompanied by
   a small twisting motion is studied for the neo-Hookean model.  The exact
   periodic solution for the axial response is obtained; and the coupled,
   small torsional motion is then determined by Hill's equation.  A
   stability criterion for the Mathieu-Hill equation is used to obtain
   stability maps in a physical parameter space.  Geometrical conditions
   sufficient for universal stability of the motion are read from this
   graph.  Instability of the torsional oscillation, the beating phenomenon
   and exchange of energies, and the relation of the stability diagram to
   amplitude bounds on the uncoupled, linearized motion sufficient to
   assure universal stability predicted for small amplitude vibrations, are
   discussed and described graphically with the aid of a numerical model. 
   It is shown that an unstable configuration may be stabilized by
   increasing the diameter of the disk.}},

   observed that blend ratios such as 50/50, 40/60, 25/75 and 15/85 of
   nylon 6/ABS were having more compatibility in comparison with other
   blends.  It is evident from the study of glass transition temperature,
   melting point, heat of fusion, change of crystallinity and activation
   energy values.  Thermogravimetric analysis shows a decreasing trend of
   pyrolysis temperature of these blends with the increase in ABS
   concentration.  Melt flow index and density data are found to indicate
   better physical and flow characteristics in blends compared to pure
   nylon 6.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction of native phage T7 DNA with large unilamellar phospholipid
   liposomes with covalently bound cytochrome c (Cyt c) has been
   investigated.  Liposomes were prepared from mixture of
   dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine:  dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid: 
   dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (modified by alkylating reagent): 
   cholesterol with molar ratio 10:1:0,5:2,5.  Cyt c was irreversibly bound
   to the outer surface of membrane as a result of reaction with alkylating
   derivative of dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine.  Lipid was modified
   by N,N,N'-tris(2-chloroethyl)-N'-(p-formylphenyl)-propylenediamine-1,3. 
   Complete reaction of Cyt c with membrane occurred in 30 min.  For DNA -
   Cyt c - membrane complex formation it was necessary to incubate mixture
   for 1.5 hours.  It was shown that part of DNA in the complex was
   resistant to DNase II digestion even after proteinase K hydrolysis of
   Cyt c.  Moreover, this part of DNA was bound to membrane in conditions
   of complete dissociation of DNA - Cyt c complex in solution.  All data
   obtained lead to conclusion about possibility of translocation of DNA
   into the inner volume of liposomes.}},

Abstract = {{A fluorescence energy transfer signal was used to follow conformational
   changes occurring in two types of protein-protein complexes.  The first
   complex studied was the native-like beta-2 subunit of Escherichia coli
   tryptophan synthase reconstituted by reassembly of the N- and C-terminal
   proteolytic domains of the beta chain.  The other complexes were formed
   by the association of the N-terminal fragment (F1) with a monoclonal
   ANTIBODY THAT RECOGNIZE THE NATIVE DIMERIC PROTEIN; FOUR SUCH complexes,
   obtained with different antibodies that recognized four distinct
   antigenic sites on native beta-2, were investigated.  It was shown that
   a structural readjustment, which the isolated F1 domain was unable to
   undergo alone, was imposed upon F1 by interdomain interactions.
   Furthermore, with three of the four antibodies studied, the same
   conformational change in F1 also occurred after formation of the
   F1-antibody complex.  These results demonstrate that, through an
   ``INDUCED FIT MECHANISM{''}, ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY STEREOSPECIFIC ASSEMBLY
   CAN force the polypeptide chain to adopt a structure more closely
   resembling THE CONFORMATION IT HAS IN THE NATIVE PROTEIN.}},

Abstract = {{High resolution zero field and Zeeman rotational spectra of 1 D-pyrazole
   have been studied by microwave Fourier-transform spectroscopy.  The zero
   field hfs patterns allowed to improve the quadrupole coupling constants
   for both N-14 nuclei.  From the high field Zeeman multiplets the
   diagonal elements of the g-tensor were obtained as g(aa) = -0.1178(2),.
   g(bb) = -0.0762(2) and g(cc) = 0.0608 (2).  The two independent
   components of the molecular magnetic susceptibility anisotropy in units
   of 10(-6) erg G-2 mole-1 are 2-zeta-aa-zeta-bb-zeta-cc = 52.69(32) and
   2-zeta-bb-zeta-cc-zeta-aa = 39.32(29) were, a, b, c denote the molecular
   principal inertia axes.  From these values the components of the
   molecular electric quadrupole moment tensor in units of 10(-26) esu cm2
   follow as Q(aa) = 5.84(22), Q(bb) = -0.58 (21) and Q(cc) = -5.27 (38). 
   Comparison with corresponding values for the undeuterated species leads
   to the complete tensors including their orientation with respect to the

Abstract = {{We have examined polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) adhesion to
   mesangial cells (MC) in vitro and have assessed the actions of
   lipoxygenase (LO) products in this process.  On exposure to either
   leukotriene B4 (LTB4), or leukotriene D4 (LTD4), In-111-labeled PMNs
   adhere to monolayers of cultured MC.  These actions were rapid in onset
   (< 5 min) and dependent upon leukotriene concentration (10(-9) to 10(-6)
   M) and the presence of divalent cations.  Adhesion was sustained (0-30
   min), and neither LTB4 nor LTD4 was metabolized to inactive products
   during PMNMC interaction, as determined by their recovery after
   reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.  LTB4 was a
   PMN-directed stimulus, whereas LTD4 appeared to act on MC.  A monoclonal
   antibody (TS 1/18) against the CD18 component of the PMN CD18/CD11
   adhesion complex inhibited the LTB4-induced response, indicating
   involvement of this PMN glyco-protein in the adhesion process.  In
   contrast, this antibody did not affect LTD4-induced adhesion, suggesting
   that this response was mediated by other adhesion epitopes.  When added
   alone, neither lipoxin A4 (LXA4) nor lipoxin B4 (LXB4) provoked PMN
   adhesion to MC.  In contrast, LXA4 and LXB4 at equimolar concentrations
   attenuated the LTD4- but not LTB4-induced response.  Together, these
   results provide further evidence that LO-derived eicosanoids may
   constitute important early signals that regulate PMN-MC interaction in
   glomerular inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from a field survey of living molluscan
   communities and associated (sub)fossil life and death assemblages found
   on the modern braided river floodplain of the River Lech, in northern
   Austria.  The study was undertaken in order to throw light on the
   taphonomy of molluscs in present-day braided river environments, as a
   basis for understanding in more detail the origins and significance of
   some of the fossil assemblages commonly found in Quaternary braided
   river deposits in lowland Britain.  The field data suggest that
   different types of (sub)fossil molluscan life and death assemblage tend
   to accumulate in distinct depositional environments on the braided
   floodplain.  Variations in the sub-fossil assemblages (e.g. in the
   numbers of species found, the patterns of breakage and the numbers of
   individuals) seem to reflect variations in the immediate character of
   the local depositional environment and the post-mortem history of the
   shells, rather than changes in general climatic conditions.  It is
   suggested that considerable care is needed in using the evidence from
   Quaternary molluscan faunas obtained from braided rivers as indicators
   of past regional vegetation and climate, unless there is a clear
   understanding of the characteristics of the diverse local depositional
   environments, the taphonomic processes operating within them, and the
   lifecycles and ecologies of the molluscs involved.}},

Abstract = {{Focus-of-attention is extremely important in human visual perception. 
   If computer vision systems are to perform tasks in a complex, dynamic
   world they will have to be able to control processing in a way that is
   analogous to visual attention in humans.  Problems connected to
   foveation (examination of selected regions of the world at high
   resolution) are examined.  In particular, the problem of finding and
   classifying junctions from this aspect is considered.  It is shown that
   foveation as simulated by controlled, active zooming in conjunction with
   scale-space techniques allows for robust detection and classification of
   junctions.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory crosses were carried out among three genetically
   differentiated Los Angeles populations (all located within approximately
   15 km) and one San Diego population (approximately 150 km away) of the
   intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus. Despite high levels of
   allozyme differentiation, all crosses produced viable F1 progeny. Most
   F1 progeny had shorter developmental times and reduced variance in
   developmental times compared to the parental populations. Only one pair
   of populations failed to produce viable F2 progeny; when the central Los
   Angeles population (AB) was crossed to the San Diego (SD) population,
   most larvae died during the late naupliar stages. Developmental times in
   the F2 generation of the other Los Angeles x San Diego crosses were
   typically 40\% longer than developmental times of the parental
   populations. Among the Los Angeles populations, only one cross (and not
   its reciprocal) showed a similarly large increase in developmental time.
   Variance in F2 developmental times was greater than the parental
   variance in 5 of 10 crosses. These results are discussed with regard to
   the evolution of coadapted gene complexes and population differentiation
   in T. californicus.}},

Abstract = {{The gas-phase protonation of HN3 has been investigated by a combination
   of ab initio calculations and mass spectrometric techniques.  The
   geometry, the charge distribution, and the relative stability of four
   isomeric H2N3+ species identified as true minima on the potential energy
   hypertsurface, i.e. the (H2N-N-N)+ aminodiazonium ion 1, the (HN-N-NH)+
   iminodiazenium ion 2, the cyclic (H2 Activated N-N-N)+ ion 3, and the
   linear (HN-NH-N)+ ion 4, listed in order of decreasing stability, have
   been calculated at the MP2/6-31G{*} parallel-to 6-31G{*} + ZPVE
   (6-31G{*}) level of theory.  Gaseous H2N3+ ions have been prepared by CI
   mass spectrometry from different ion-molecule reactions, including
   protonation of HN3 by various Bronsted acids, self-protonation of HN3,
   and loss of ethene from protonated EtN3.  The proton affinity (PA) of
   HN3 has been found by proton-transfer equilibria measurements to amount
   to 176.6+/-1.0 kcal mol-1, consistent with the calculated value of 176.2
   kcal mol-1.  MIKE and CAD spectrometry of H2N3+ populations from
   reactions of different exothermicity suggests the existence of two of
   the isomers characterized by ab initio calculations, namely the
   aminodiazonium ion 1 and the iminodiazenium ion 2, neither previously
   observed in the gas phase, the former having been previously detected in
   superacid solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Damage during the reactive ion etching in CH4/H2 of thin, heavily
   silicon doped, molecular beam epitaxy grown GaAs layers has been
   investigated.  Hall effect and CV measurements showed near complete loss
   of the free carrier concentration on etching due to passivation by
   hydrogen of the silicon donor activity.  Annealing for a few minutes at
   400-degrees-C was sufficient to recover the sheet concentration of the
   material, measured by Hall effect, but only to a limit determined by the
   dc bias employed during etching.  At 800 V only 5\% of the carriers were
   restored, while reducing the dc bias to 80 V allowed 70\% to 80\%
   recovery.  CV measurements showed that increased surface depletion
   accounted for the loss of sheet concentration, while the doping profile
   in the undepleted channel was unaffected.  At 80 V dc bias, the
   increased surface depletion was only 2.6 nm.  Additionally Hall mobility
   was restored by annealing, to close to the original value of the
   unetched material, indicating minimal reactive ion etching damage to the
   depassivated material.  Etching of the gate recess of 120-nm gate length
   metal-semiconductor field effect transistors, at low dc bias, allowed
   devices with excellent dc and rf performance to be fabricated; dc
   transconductance of g(m) = 400 mS/mm and unity current gain cutoff
   frequency of f(T) = 70 GHz were achieved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical technique based on the computation of contaminant dispersion
   in a localized area is presented.  It allows a two-dimensional
   description of the plume when the dispersion scale is much smaller than
   the hydrodynamic one.  The technique was implemented in the
   computational system MANCHAS, developed at the LHA, and was applied to
   the plume generated by the sewage discharge of Buenos Aires city in the
   Rio de la Plata.  The velocity and depth fields were achieved by the
   computational system HIDROBID II, also developed at the LHA.  The
   physical parameters involved in the phenomenon, such as dispersion
   coefficients and time of decay, were estimated from field measurements. 
   Some numerical tests were performed for different tides and wind
   velocities.  It can be concluded from the results that the wind, as a
   generator of drift currents, is the relevant mechanism of transport of
   the pollutant.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of miniaturized electron optical systems comprising a
   field emission microsource and a microlens for probe forming has been
   studied.  A complete system measuring millimeters in length and diameter
   with performance exceeding that of a conventional system over a wide
   range of potentials (100 V-10 kV) and working distances (up to 10 mm)
   appears to be feasible.  A scanning tunneling microscope aligned field
   emission microsource offers performance well suited for this application
   and a selective scaling approach has been developed to allow a wide
   range of potentials to be applied.  Such miniaturized systems can be of
   significant importance to many areas of electron-beam applications.}},

Abstract = {{Cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 was used as a model system for a
   prolonged delivery of insecticidal crystal proteins of Bacillus
   thuringiensis subsp. israelensis in the water surface. The bt8 gene,
   encoding a 128 kDa (Bt8) mosquitocidal protein, and the 28kd gene,
   encoding a 28 kDa cytotoxic protein, were integrated into the
   cyanobacterial chromosome. The genes were expressed under the control of
   the psbA promoter, derived from the tobacco chloroplast genome. The Bt8
   protein produced by the cyanobacterium was toxic to mosquito larvae. The
   28kd gene expression in the cyanobacterium was very low, partly owing to
   the low level of steady state mRNA. With the same system, it was
   demonstrated that the herbicide-resistance gene bar could be used as a
   new selectable marker in cyanobacterial transformation experiments.}},

Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY}},
Year = {{1990}},

Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about behaviour patterns and habitat use of large (400 +
   mm total length) brown trout Salmo trutta.  We used radio telemetry to
   monitor the movements of eight large (437-635 mm), free-ranging brown
   trout for up to 346 d. Total range of movement upstream and downstream
   varied from 370 m to 33.420 m.  At some time during the year, six of the
   fish moved out of an area protected with no-kill fishing regulations,
   even through none of them were tagged and released closer than 2 km from
   its boundaries.  However, four of five fish traced during the height of
   the fishing season spent 87\% of their time in the protected area.  The
   fish appeared to have separate winter and summer ranges.  Five of six
   fish tracked during autumn-winter moved upstream about 10 km to slower,
   deeper parts of the river between August and November, and remained
   there at least through the following April.  The part of the river used
   as autumn-winter range was considered only marginal habitat for brown
   trout during summer due to warm water temperatures.  Individuals used as
   many as four specific home sites within their spring-summer range;
   average separation between home sites was 386 m.  The fish typically
   rotated among sites, spending 2-3 d at one site before moving, usually
   at night, to another section of river.  Activity was divided into two
   categories:  active displacement-long-range travel from one part of the
   range to another; and foraging-short-range movements that might occur
   when searching for food.  Active displacement appeared to be correlated
   with stream discharge.  Fish displaced themselves an average of 239 m
   between telemetry observations in spring-summer and 3,103 m in
   autumn-winter; only 11\% of this variation was attributable to
   variations in the length of time between telemetry observations in
   spring-summer and autumn-winter.  Daily foraging activity varied by
   month and appeared to be related to light level, food availability, and
   water temperature.  In spring-summer, fish typically moved to midstream
   to forage at night, then returned to cover at specific home sites during
   the day.  The sites they selected in daytime were characterized by deep
   (> 30 cm), slow (< 10 cm/s) water with heavy log cover and silt
   substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) is well recognized as an effective host
   plant for the symbiotic fixation of N.  While this fixation process
   leads to the rapid accumulation of N within the ecosystem, it also
   enhances nutrient accumulation in biomass and soil organic matter and
   increases nitrification and cation leaching.  We hypothesized that
   changes in soil properties resulting from these processes would decrease
   site productivity for second rotation red alder.  Adjacent stands of 55
   yr old alder and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii {[}Mirb.] Franco)
   were studied at the Thompson Research Center on the Cedar River
   Watershed in western Washington, USA.  The presence of red alder caused
   the following soil changes:  decreased soil solution pH, increased CEC,
   increased exchangeable acidity accompanied by a decreased soil pH and
   base saturation.  This decreased soil and soil solution pH resulted in
   increased Al concentration in the soil solution and on exchange sites as
   well as decreased P availability.  To determine the effect of these
   changes on the productivity of the 2nd rotation alder forest, a species
   conversion experiment was initiated 5 yr ago.  Results from this
   conversion study clearly indicated that the first rotation red alder
   forest has caused a relative decrease in the productivity of the second
   rotation red alder plantation.  Compared to the growth of red alder on
   the former Douglas fir site, the second rotation red alder on the former
   red alder site exhibited 33\% less height growth and 75\% less
   aboveground biomass accumulation after 5 yr.  Future research will focus
   on identifying those factors causing this lower productivity including P
   availability, soil acidity and Al toxicity, cation availability, and
   competition with other vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{In response to Congressional mandate and under the aegis of the Federal
   Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), a
   comprehensive report to Congress on childhood lead poisoning in the
   United States was prepared.  We have examined numbers of lead-exposed
   U.S.  children by socioeconomic/demographic strata for children 0.5 to 5
   years of age; by children in U.S.  lead-screening programs; and by
   enumerations of children 0.5 to 5 years old in the oldest (i.e., highest
   paint lead and lead plumbing) housing.  Using blood lead (PbB)
   prevalence projection modeling and data of the Second National Health
   and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), it is estimated for 1984
   that 2.4 million black and white children 0.5 to 5 years old in
   metropolitan U.S. had PbB levels > 15 mu-g/dL.  For all races and the
   entire nation, we estimate 3 to 4 million children will have PbB levels
   > 15 mu-g/dL.  Inner-city, low-income children have the highest
   prevalences of PbB levels above this criterion level, but sizable
   numbers of all strata of children have elevated PbB levels when
   considering both base populations and prevalences for the specific
   strata (total of 30 strata).  Lead screening programs indicate much
   lower numbers of exposed children compared to NHANES II-based
   projections, for various reasons that allow programs to underestimate
   true prevalences.  Analysis of 1980 U.S. Census Bureau housing data for
   318 standard metropolitan statistical areas show that 4.4 million
   children 0.5 to 5 years old live in the oldest U.S. housing (pre-1950). 
   Of these, most are actually in the more affluent socioeconomic strata.}},

Abstract = {{Formations with interbedded cherts constitute an important part of the
   Lower Brioverian succession (Upper Proterozoic age) in the Armorican
   Massif (northwest France).  These formations are composed of
   shale-sandstone alterations with interbedded siliceous carbonaceous
   members.  Petrographic and geochemical study of the detrital facies
   shows that these rocks are compositionally immature.  The wackes are
   rich in lithic fragments (volcanic fragments:  3-20\% modal; sedimentary
   and metamorphic fragments:  0-7\% modal) and in feldspar (5-16\%).  From
   the geochemical point of view, they are relatively enriched in Fe2O3 +
   MgO (about 5.5\%) and in alkalis with Na2O/K2O ratios greater than 1.
   The CaO contents are low (about 0.3\%).  Slightly negative Eu anomalies
   are observed (Eu/Eu{*} = 0.8).  Their chemical compositions are in
   agreement with a dominantly acidic source area with deposition in a
   continental active margin setting.  Compared with other Upper
   Proterozoic deposits of the Armorican Massif, the interbedded-chert
   formations appear rather similar to other deposits in North Brittany
   which accumulated in a intra-arc or back-arc basin environment.
   The formations with interbedded cherts are interpreted as having been
   deposited during an early stage of magmatic arc activity (around 640 -
   630 Ma ago) in an immature marginal basin.  The clastic supply to these
   formations is derived in part from early volcanic products (acidic to
   intermediate) which are linked to subduction beneath the North Armorican
   Domain.  Another component is inherited from the reworking of 2000 Ma
   old basement relics.  The opening of the back-arc domain, with
   associated basaltic volcanism, would bring about a progressive
   displacement of the interbedded-chert depositional basin towards the
   continental margin.}},

Abstract = {{New Ar-40/39 Ar homblende and U-Pb zircon data from units previously
   thought to represent basement to the Avalon composite terrane in
   southern New Brunwsick yield latest Precambrian or early Cambrian
   metamorphic cooling ages and a late Precambrian protolith age. 
   Hornblendes from the Brookville Gneiss and from an intrusive amphibolite
   body within the gneiss yield Ar-40/39 Ar isotope correlation ages of 542
   +/- 4 and 535 +/- 2 Ma, respectively.  These ages are interpreted to
   date postamphibolite facies metamorphic cooling.  Euhedral zircons from
   the Point Pleasant orthogneiss, a quartz dioritic gneiss previously
   interpreted to be the oldest component of the Brookville Gneiss, show
   slight inheritance and yield Pb-207/Pb-206 ages ranging from 603 to 631
   Ma.  The youngest of these is interpreted to be a maximum age for the
   orthogneiss protolith.
   These results, together with other recent U-Pb age data, conflict with
   previous interpretations of the Brookville Gneiss and the
   metasedimentary Green Head Group with which it is associated, as a
   mobilized Proterozoic basement-cover succession upon which an Avalonian
   ensialic arc developed at c. 600-635 Ma.  Instead, the age of the
   orthogneiss matches that of the arc, and the orthogneiss protolith is
   likely to have been originally intrusive into the Green Head Group. 
   Although the arc succession is unaffected by high-grade metamorphism,
   the metamorphic cooling age recorded in the ``basement{''} closely
   follows evidence of within-arc extension at c. 550 Ma.  Hence, the
   arc/{''}basement{''} contrasts in tectonothermal regime could be those
   of varying structural level within the Avalonian arc rather than
   requiring the proposed existence of entirely separate terranes.}},

Abstract = {{In order to determine the function of the insA gene that is part of the
   structure of the IS1 element, we have constructed derivatives of plasmid
   pUC19::Tn9' containing oligonucleotide inserts.  These inserts of nine
   bp or less were introduced into the Pstl site present in both copies of
   IS1 that are found in transposon Tn9'.  The nonameric oligonucleotide
   inserts encode neutral amino acids, and do not disturb the reading
   frame.  To determine the capacity of one mutant transposon, Tn9'/X, to
   generate simple insertions and cointegrates, we have conducted
   mobilization experiments with pUC19 derivatives containing either the
   wild type or the mutant transposon, and the pRP3.1 conjugative plasmid
   as the helper.  The damage inflicted on the insA gene did not affect the
   capacity of the transposon to generate simple insertions and
   cointegrates in either recA- or rec+ Escherichia coli strains.  However,
   following subsequent transposition of the mutant transposon from
   pRP3.1::Tn9'/X to pBR322, the frequency of cointegrate formation was
   found to be 10- to 20-fold lower than that observed for the wild type
   transposon.  We have isolated unstable (dissociating) cointegrates that
   were formed following transposition of the mutant transposon from
   pUC19::Tn9'/X to pRP3.1.  These cointegrates were shown to dissociate in
   a ``regular{''} manner in recA- Escherichia coli cells, i.e., the
   majority of the resulting plasmids were of the pUC19::Tn9'/X or
   pUC19::IS1/X types.  Our results support the notion that the insA gene
   product is not important for transposition, but may be involved in the
   generation of IS1-flanking deletions.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear stability of arbitrary mixing-layer profiles in an
   incompressible, homogeneous fluid is studied in the high-Reynolds-number
   limit where the critical layer is linear and viscous.  The type of
   bifurcation from the marginal state is found to depend crucially on the
   symmetry properties of the basic-state profile.  When the vorticity
   profile of the mean flow is perfectly symmetric, the bifurcation is
   stationary.  When the symmetry of the profile is broken, the bifurcation
   is Hopf.  The nonsymmetry of the mixing layer also introduces some
   changes in the critical layer and the matching of flow quantities across

   is a traditional one in that species are separated primarily on the
   basis of size.  The hydrophobic step separates species on the basis of
   parameters apparently not related to size.  By combining these two
   steps, an increase in TNf purity of 7-10-fold can be achieved with a
   yield of 50\%.  The effects of cellular debris and pH on selectivity and
   recovery of the hydrophobic filtration step ar discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The sulphonation of toluene with 98\% sulphuric acid, at different molar
   reactants ratio from 0.9 to 1.1 acid to toluene and at a temperature
   ranges from 85-degrees-C to 110-degrees-C is studied kinetically.  The
   reaction is carried out on a bench scale.  Representative samples of the
   reaction mixture are analysed, after immediate neutralization with
   sodium hydroxide, for active matter content.  The experimental data is
   used in developing a mathematical model describing the overall process
   kinetics, considering a second order reversible reaction.  The kinectic
   parameters for the reaction are estimated for << best fit >> of the
   experimental data minimizing the deviation between measured data and
   those calculated according to the model since the mean difference is
   about 5\%.  This model in fact describes fairly well the process kinetic
   through the evaluated parameters which are incerted between 0.002-0.005
   L/mol.min for the sulfonation and 0.0013-0.009 L/mol.min for
   desulfonation.  It is observed from the results that the molar ratio has
   a significant effect, while the optimum reaction temperature is
   95-degrees-C within the experimental conditions.}},

   relative oestrogen dominance due to the antiprogestogen treatment
   selectively decreased the alpha-2-adrenoceptor subtype in the cervix,
   where an alpha-adrenoceptor dominance was found on day 27 of pregnancy. 
   The result indicate a heterologous regulation of alpha-adrenoceptors by
   sex steriods, i.e. suppression of the alpha-2-adrenoceptor concentration

Abstract = {{The successful results obtained using Doppler sonography for antepartal
   diagnosis gave cause to use the method during labor.  For this purpose
   doppler measurements of the intern fetal carotid artery of a group of 7
   patients with normal course of pregnancy were made and a continuous
   direct CTG was recorded simultaneously.  The doppler parameter, the
   S/D-ratio, for the contraction phases were compared with those of the
   contraction - free phases.  During the contraction phase the S/D-ratio
   was higher than during the relaxation period of the uterus.  The
   difference between these values were proved to be statistically
   significant.  A comparison of the doppler parameter of the patients at
   onset of labor and the patients at the end of labor showed, that the
   S/D-ratio increased significantly at the end of labor.  This result
   demonstrates, that the intravascular resistance in the fetal carotid
   artery increased due to the cephalic pressure.}},

Abstract = {{By determining magnetic field, a new method that can define secondary
   polarization current in surface and volume polarized medium is advanced
   in this paper.  In essence, it is different from the method that only
   determines electric field or current.  When an excitation current of
   time domain, single signal or long pules, passes through the surface and
   volume polarized medium, an induced polarization (IP) effect is produced
   at surface and inside of the polarized body.  If in polarized medium the
   secondary polarized current has been produced by virtue of IP effect in
   electrified time and in discharge process after breaking current, then
   the polarized medium will produce a secondary magnetid field around it.
   By observing magnetid field, some important contents in surface and
   volume polarized medium, such as the secondary polarized current exists
   or not, how large value is; and what is the vector's direction, have
   been reliably determined.
   Besides some experiment results, field results are given in this paper.
   For many years, the scholares at home and abroad have different views to
   the secondary polarized current exists or not in volume polarized
   medium.  Therefore, this paper gives some experimental results that have
   convincing arguments, contributing to the standardization of the
   recognition in this aspect.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation of elastin during various pathological processes such as
   emphysema or arteriosclerosis was demonstrated by several investigators.
   In the present work, we adapted an ELISA technique for the determination
   of elastin peptide (EP) levels in human sera and plasma, in healthy and
   arteriosclerotic subjects.  This test makes use of human aorta elastin
   hydrolyzed by a chemical procedure (kappa-elastin) instead of EP
   produced by pancreatic or leukocyte elastase.  Polyclonal antibodies to
   this antigen were obtained in rabbits.  The indirect ELISA procedure is
   sensitive, specific and reproducible.  No correlation could be
   demonstrated between EP level and anti-EP antibody concentration of IgG
   or IgM types determined in the same serum samples.  These antibodies did
   not interfere with EP determinations.  EP concentration did not change
   with age in control subjects.  In obliterative arteriosclerosis of the
   legs and in type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia, EP levels showed a marked
   increase, while in hypertension, ischemic heart disease and diabetes
   mellitus, the increase was moderate.  In stroke, only slight changes
   were observed.  In type IV hyperlipoproteinemia, EP levels were lower
   than in controls.}},
