Abstract = {{The roots of 27 species of South Florida plants in 15 families
   (including one cycad, six palms, one Smilax, and 19 dicotyledons) native
   to pine rockland and tropical hardwood hammock communities were examined
   for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These plants grow in the
   biologically diverse but endangered Greater Everglades habitat. Roots
   from field-grown and potted plants were cleared and stained. All 27
   species had AMF and include 14 species having an endangered or
   threatened status. The Paris-type colonization occurred in two species
   in the families Annonaceae and Smilacaceae. The Arum-type occurred in 22
   species in the families Anacardiaceae, Arecaceae (Palmae), Boraginaceae,
   Cactaceae (questionable), Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Lauraceae,
   Melastomataceae, Polygalaceae, Rubiaceae, Simaroubaceae, Ulmaceae, and
   Zamiaceae. Three species in the families Fabaceae, Lauraceae, and

Abstract = {{Objectives: We performed a retrospective analysis of first relapses
   after cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced germ-cell
   tumors, in order to better define the appropriate follow-up.
   Methods: These patients were treated between 1986 and 1998 in two
   institutions. They were either followed after first-line chemotherapy at
   the same center or referred for relapse.
   Results: Ninety-six patients relapsed (17.5\% of the total number of
   patients treated in the same time period). Thirty-five (36.4\%) patients
   had serum tumor marker levels (AFP, hCG and LDH) normal values. Sites of
   relapse were: abdominal in 47 (49\%) patients, thoracic in 17 (17.7\%),
   thoraco-abdominal in 15 (15.6\%), and brain in 8 (8.3). Seven (7.3\%)
   patients had elevated markers only, 1 (1\%) had isolated
   supra-clavicular lymph node, 1 (1\%) had bone metastasis only.
   Eighty-two patients (85\%) relapsed during the first 18 months of
   follow-up. All patients with brain metastases at relapse and those who
   obtained sCR after chemotherapy relapsed within 8 months of follow-up.
   Sixteen patients underwent resection of growing teratoma.
   Conclusions: These results allow to recommend extensive follow-up during
   the first two years after response to first line treatment. It includes
   marker level determination and whole body CT scan and less intensive
   work-up there after. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   improves comparability between modes. Through an analysis of the

Abstract = {{Wide band gap semiconductors like SiC are excellent materials for high
   temperature, high frequency and high power applications. Furthermore,
   the properties of SiC fulfil the requirements for modem applications in
   micro-sensors, micro-actuators as well as in micro- and
   nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS). Novel applications of
   SiC/Si based MEMS and NEMS are dosing and sensor systems for micro- and
   nano-fluidic systems, e.g. for fast and reliable biomedical testing and
   analysis. We have developed a technology for processing SiC/Si-based
   MEMS and NEMS. A micro dosing head for pulmonary amounts of water-based
   liquids was realized. This dosing head consist of parallel operating
   multi micro pipes running at a defined pressure. Furthermore, we used
   3C-SiC/Si heterostructures to process resonator bars having geometries
   in the mu m range and a thickness of 250 nm. These bars open the
   possibility to evaluate the viscosity of water nanodroplets, to measure
   the mass of biomolecules, especially proteins, positioned on the bars.
   The used 3C-SiC layers were grown by a special chemical vapor deposition
   under ultra high vacuum (UHVCVD) conditions. This kind of deposition
   process allows us to grow the cubic silicon carbide polytype at
   relatively low temperature (below 900 degrees C). Such growth conditions
   allow reducing the internal stress of the grown monocrystalline layers,
   which is an important precondition for fabrication of reliable MEMS and
   NEMS structures based on silicon carbide. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Illness beliefs of patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) and their
   relation to emotional distress}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{896-903}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims: Intestinal failure (IF) is likely to be the source
   of significant emotional distress for patients; however, little is known
   about the system of beliefs held by patients on home parenteral
   nutrition (HPN) that may underpin such distress. The present study aimed
   to: (1) examine the `common-sense' representation of IF in patients on
   HPN; (2) investigate whether there were any differences in such
   representations with regard to primary diagnosis, clinical history or
   aspects of treatment; and (3) test the relative importance of
   psychological, disease and treatment factors in accounting for
   IF-specific emotional outcome (feelings of anger, upset, anxiety, low
   mood, and fear).
   Methods: Sixty-one patients with IF on HPN completed an assessment of
   their beliefs about causes of their condition, consequences, symptoms
   experienced, personal and treatment control, chronicity and recurrence,
   and emotional representations (feelings of anger, upset, anxiety, low
   mood, and fear). Standard clinical information was also gathered from
   patients.
   Results: Neither primary diagnosis, age, duration since start of HPN,
   number of nights on HPN, gender, presence of a stoma, or age at onset of
   HPN showed any significant differential effect on emotional
   representations. The principal predictors of emotional representations
   were: (1) poorer appraisals of patients' ability to exert personal
   control over aspects of their condition and treatment; and (2) the
   perception that the condition and treatment makes little sense to the
   patient (illness coherence).
   Conclusions: The current study demonstrates that the illness and their
   treatments per se are insufficient to account for patients' emotional
   distress. Rather, cognitive variables, chiefly beliefs about personal
   control and illness coherence account for more of the variance in
   emotional outcome than any other clinical or health-related variable
   assessed in the current study. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and European

Abstract = {{Effective use and recycling of manures together with occasional and
   judicious use of supplementary fertilizing materials forms the basis for
   management of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) within organic farming
   systems. Replicated field trials were established at three sites across
   the UK to compare the supply of P and K to grass-clover swards cut for
   silage from a range of fertilizing materials, and to assess the
   usefulness of routine soil tests for P and K in organic farming systems.
   None of the fertilizing materials (farmyard manure, rock phosphate, Kali
   vinasse, volcanic tuff) significantly increased silage yields, nor was P
   offtake increased. However, farmyard manure and Kali vinasse proved
   effective sources of K to grass and clover in the short to medium term.
   Available P (measured as Olsen-P) showed no clear relationship with crop
   P offtake in these trials. In contrast, available K (measured by
   ammonium nitrate extraction) proved a useful measurement to predict K
   availability to crops and support K management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{An extremely accurate but simple asymptotic description for the path of
   a light ray propagating over a curved Earth with steady radial
   variations in refractive index is derived using simple scaling
   arguments. It is used to determine effectively exact analytic solutions
   for the path of rays through refractive-index profiles described in
   terms of patched quadratics. Such patched quadratics can be used to
   accurately describe almost all refractive-index profiles of practical
   interest. The results show that images generated by rays passing through
   a quadratic refractive-index profile are uniformly magnified in the
   vertical direction, and magnification and displacement observations can
   be used to determine the refractive-index profile parameters. For
   patched quadratics, observations of critical rays can be used to
   determine the thicknesses of the quadratic layers.
   An effectively exact solution is also obtained for exponential index
   profiles and this is used to determine the path of rays through a thin
   boundary layer attached to the Earth; an inferior mirage situation.}},

   with soluble nuclear transport receptors prior to translocation across

   correlation spectroscopy, we have studied the stability of cargo
   complexes in solution in the presence and in the absence of RanGTP. We
   find that RanGTP has a higher affinity for the major import receptor,
   the importin alpha/beta heterodimer, when importin alpha does not carry
   a cargo, suggesting that some nuclear transport targets might be

Abstract = {{Environmentalists and ecopsychologists claim that focusing on ``I{''}

   attitudes and personality characteristics. integrating these effects, we
   predicted that individuals lacking pro-environmental internal
   characteristics (nonenvironmentalists and those high on
   exploitativeness) Would show decreased connection to nature in response
   to heightened OSA, while individuals with pro-ell vi roll mental
   internal characteristics would not. For these individuals, their
   pro-environmental internal characteristics should counteract the effects
   of OSA on connection to nature. Two studies provide empirical Support

Abstract = {{A common theme in recent landscape studies is the comparison of riparian
   and watershed land use as predictors of stream health. The objective of
   this study was to compare the performance of reach-scale habitat and
   remotely assessed watershed-scale habitat as predictors of stream health
   over varying spatial extents. Stream health was measured with scores on
   a fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) using data from 95 stream reaches
   in the Eastern Corn Belt Plain (ECBP) ecoregion of Indiana. Watersheds
   hierarchically nested within the ecoregion were used to regroup sampling
   locations to represent varying spatial extents. Reach habitat was
   represented by metrics of a qualitative habitat evaluation index,
   whereas watershed variables were represented by riparian forest,
   geomorphology, and hydrologic indices. The importance of reach- versus
   watershed-scale variables was measured by multiple regression model
   adjusted-R-2 and best subset comparisons in the general linear
   statistical framework. Watershed models had adjusted-R-2 ranging from
   0.25 to 0.93 and reach models had adjusted-R-2 ranging from 0.09 to
   0.86. Better-fitting models were associated with smaller spatial
   extents. Watershed models explained about 15\% more variation in IBI
   scores than reach models on average. Variety of surficial geology
   contributed to decline in model predictive power. Results should be
   interpreted bearing in mind that reach habitat was qualitatively
   measured and only fish assemblages were used to measure stream health.
   Riparian forest and length-slope (LS) factor were the most important
   watershed-scale variables and mostly positively correlated with IBI
   scores, whereas substrate and riffle-pool quality were the important
   reach-scale variables in the ECBP.}},

   K0.12CoO2 center dot 0.8H(2)O and K0.16CoO2 center dot 0.6H(2)O have
   been obtained after the KMnO4 and K2S2O8 treatment, respectively. The
   diffraction peaks of K0.12CoO2 center dot 0.8H(2)O and K0.16CoO2 center
   dot 0.6H(2)O can be well indexed by a hexagonal cell similar to the
   monolayer hydrate NaxCoO2 center dot yH(2)O. Afterdehydration, the major
   phases have an orthorhombic structure similar to Na0.5CoO2 and show
   semiconductor behavior. Both K0.12CoO2 center dot 0.8H(2)O and K0.16CoO2
   center dot 0.6H(2)O are primarily paramagnetic and show metallic
   behavior. K0.16CoO2 center dot 0.6H(2)O has a spin-glass-like transition
   or other magnetic fluctuations around 56 K. The spin-glass-like
   transition or the regions of magnetic phase separation are reduced in
   K0.12CoO2 center dot 0.8H(2)O due to the increasing of the intercalated
   water. We also discussed similarities and differences between the
   structural and physical properties of KxCoO2 and NaxCoO2.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental error correction and scaling is the last step in X-ray
   diffraction data processing. It is also critical in obtaining
   good-quality data. In this study, an algorithm is proposed to more
   generally and efficiently correct experimental error in X-ray crystal
   diffraction data. With this algorithm, the experimental error is
   represented by a symbolic three-dimensional function C(xi, eta, t) in
   the detecting space. Here, (xi, eta) are the coordinates of the
   diffraction spots on the image and t represents the data-collection
   time. While the theoretical form of C(xi, eta, t) is not known, it will
   be determined from the data through computer-aided analysis. The free
   R-merge is introduced to check the validity of the solution. The
   three-dimensional symbolic function does not carry any assumptions and
   thus can generally account for experimental errors in various X-ray
   crystal diffraction experiments that are normally too complicated to be
   described by any fixed formula. Tests will be given to compare the
   results from different algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Ever since it was proposed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
   involved in the pathogeneses of various diseases, superoxide dismutase
   (SOD)-mimetic complexes have been intensively studied. We prepared
   copper(II) aspirinate {[}Cu-2(asp)(4)] from Cu(II) and aspirin, which
   has been in use for many years as an antipyretic, an analgesic, and an
   anti-inflammatory agent. However, Cu-2(asp)(4) has been found to have
   additional activities, including anti-inflammatory, antiulcer,
   anti-ischemic/reperfusion agent, anticancer, antimutagenic, and
   antimicrobial activities. The activity of copper salicylate
   {[}Cu(sal)(2)] was also compared with that of Cu-2(asp)(4). The
   structure of the Cu-2(asp)(4) was determined using X-ray structure
   analysis. Its SOD-mimetic activity was determined using cytochrome c,
   electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and ESR spin trap methods.
   The activity of Cu-2(asp)(4) was slightly greater than CuSO4 and copper
   acetate {[}Cu(ace)(2)] and slightly less than that of Cu(sal)(2). The in
   vitro antioxidant activity, evaluated in human epithelial or transformed
   neoplastic keratinocyte cells, HaCaT, and normal dermal fibroblasts in
   terms of cell survival following ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, was
   significantly increased in the presence of Cu-2(asp)(4), Cu(sal)(2), and
   CuSO4. Further, ROS generation following UVA irradiation in the skin of
   hairless mice following oral treatment with Cu-2(asp)(4) for three
   consecutive days was significantly suppressed compared to the vehicle-
   or Cu(ace)(2)-treated mice. On the basis of these results, Cu-2(asp)(4)
   was observed to be a potent antioxidative compound possessing
   antioxidative activity in biological systems. In conclusion,
   Cu-2(asp)(4) is a potent antioxidative agent that may be useful for
   future treatment of diseases resulting from ROS.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the interaction between electroacupuncture (EA)-induced
   antinociception and an endogenous anti-analgesic system. EA was applied
   to the ST-36 acupoint for 45 min in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and pain
   thresholds were assessed by the hind-paw pressure test. EA produced a
   marked increase in pain thresholds and its antinociceptive action was
   completely reversed by naloxone (5 mg/kg). The analgesic effects of
   subcutaneous morphine (7 mg/kg) following EA stimulation were
   significantly attenuated. The attenuation of morphine analgesia was
   inversely proportional to the time intervals between EA termination and
   morphine injection, and the effect was not observed 120 min after EA
   stimulation. The analgesic effects of i.t. morphine (10 mu g), but not
   i.c.v. morphine (25 mu g), following EA were also attenuated. On the
   other hand, systemic morphine (7 mg/kg)-induced hyperthermia was not
   affected by EA. Moreover, i.c.v. morphine, but not i.t. morphine,
   produced hyperthermia. The i.c.v. morphine-induced hyperthermia was not
   affected by EA, similar to i.c.v. morphine analgesia. These results
   suggest that the attenuation of morphine analgesia following EA, that
   is, the activation of an endogenous anti-analgesic system, is closely
   related to the activation of an analgesic system by EA and that the
   spinal cord plays a critical role in the activation of the endogenous

Abstract = {{Subassemblage tests were conducted on the panel zone within steel
   beam-to-concrete filled steel tube (CFT) column moment connections made
   from high-strength material to investigate their elastoplastic behavior.
   The writers propose a nonlinear shear force-deformation model for the
   panel zone in beam-to-column CFT connections for predicting the
   elastoplastic behavior of the panel zones. The proposed model includes a
   superposed model based on a trilinear shear-deformation relationship for
   the steel tube superposed on one for the concrete core, and a simple
   model provided as a trilinear model having a yield strength point and an
   ultimate strength point for this panel zone, as a practical model for
   design. The writers also propose a method for evaluating load
   resistance, in which a new theoretical compression strut mechanism is
   utilized, taking into account the confinement of the tube flange. The
   results predicted using the superposed and the simple model are found to
   agree approximately with the experimental results up to a large shear

Abstract = {{Thin films of Cd1-xZnxS (0 <= x <= 0.8) were deposited on glass
   substrates by the chemical bath deposition technique. The as-deposited
   films were exposed to a stream of slowly flowing nitrogen at annealing
   temperature ranging 100-500 degrees C. XRD patterns of as-deposited
   Cd1-xZnxS over all mixture ratio values showed the cubic zincblende
   structure of which reflection peaks associated to (111), (220) and (311)
   planes were clearly identified. However, XRD characteristics of
   hexagonal wurtzite structure appeared at annealing temperature beyond
   400 degrees C. From scanning electron microscope, the as-deposited films
   were formed by different sizes of clusters of grains of which average
   grain size smaller than 50 nm was observed. The increase in mixture
   ratio value in the starting solution was found to produce a decrease in
   the grain size. Energy gap value of annealed films, which is obtained
   from optical transmission measurements, seems to shift to lower energy
   as the annealing temperature increases. Electrical sheet resistance of
   the films, performed in the darkness and under illumination conditions
   by using a halogen lamp, as a function of annealing temperature was also
   investigated. The variation of energy gap of thin films with annealing
   temperature was discussed by employing quantum size effect phenomena.

Abstract = {{A large evidence base now exists for treatment interventions that will
   reduce fracture risk. However, the key area of practice now is how to
   get this evidence base into clinical practice. All health-care systems
   are subject to financial constraints, and therefore it is important that
   all areas of clinical practice can demonstrate that they are able to
   deliver care in a cost-effective manner. It has become increasingly
   recognized within the area of osteoporosis that treatment interventions
   should be targeted at patients at the highest absolute risk of fracture
   in order to maximize the cost-effectiveness of the service. One key
   subgroup of patients who are at higher absolute fracture risk are
   patients who present with an incident fracture. Although it has long
   been recognized that this is a key group to be considered for
   investigation and intervention, it is also clear that any form of
   structured care for this group has not been developed. This chapter will
   review the background and practical aspects of running a fracture
   liaison service. This service addresses the issue of secondary
   prevention of fracture while also considering both the absolute risk of
   fracture and the absolute benefit of the intervention. Issues relating
   to the background evidence base underpinning the service as well as the
   practical issues relating to the actual running of a service are
   discussed. Some of the potential service outcomes are also reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives. Clinical trials have shown that high dose
   chemotherapy (HDT) with peripheral stem cell autotransplantation is
   presently the best treatment for patients with symptomatic multiple
   myeloma (MM). In the context of an outcomes research project, we
   analyzed the feasibility of this strategy in clinical practice in a
   large cohort of consecutive, unselected patients with newly diagnosed MM
   and looked at the major determinants of response of patients enrolled in
   a HDT with tandem auto-transplantation (Total Therapy I, TTI) program.
   Design and Methods. Two hundred and fourteen patients were treated
   outside of a clinical trial and regularly followed-up at our Center for
   symptomatic MM. Ninety-seven patients (45\%) received conventional
   chemo-radiotherapy regimens, 110 (51\%) entered the TTI program and the
   remaining 7 patients (3.3\%) were enrolled in other programs involving
   HDT with autotransplantation.
   Results. Patients enrolled in HDT with tandem autotransplantation
   programs were 14 years younger and less likely to have co-morbidities
   than patients treated with conventional therapy. Median overall
   survivals of the two groups were 60 and 33 months, respectively.
   Thirteen percent of the patients enrolled in the TTI program did not
   receive the first HDT with autotransplantation, mostly because of
   disease progression, and another 16\% did not proceed to the second HDT
   with autotransplantation mainly because of infections or drug-related
   complications. Most patients achieved complete remission after the
   second autotransplantation, with acceptable toxicity. However, only
   patients with a major reduction of the myeloma burden at the end of
   induction therapy enjoyed significantly prolonged event-free and overall
   survivals.
   Interpretation and Conclusions. Approximately one third of patients with
   newly diagnosed symptomatic MM completed the TTI program. These data
   suggest the need to improve the induction therapy in order to increase
   both the number of patients able to proceed to autotransplantation
   programs and to enhance the rate of early response.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare malignant
   tumor of vascular origin with frequent multifocal appearance. Liver
   resection may cause tumor spread. Liver transplantation has been
   indicated for unresectable nodules. We hypothesized that adjuvant
   interferon treatment is effective to prevent metastasis after liver
   resection. We report a case of multifocal hepatic epithelioid
   hemangioendothelioma successfully treated with interferon pulse therapy
   and bilobar hepatic resection.
   Methodology. CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging diagnosed three
   nodules in the liver (segments IV, VI and VII). Histopathology and
   specific immunostaining of a percutaneous nodule biopsy confirmed the
   diagnosis of hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. The treatment
   protocol included daily interferon alpha 2b 9 weeks before and 1 week
   after resection of liver segments IV, VI and VII.
   Results. The postoperative outcome was complicated by a self-limited
   biliary fistula. The patient remains tumor free at 3 years after liver
   resection and currently enjoys excellent health.
   Conclusion. Interferon pulse therapy and hepatic resection was a good
   option to treat multifocal bilobar hepatic epithelioid
   hemangioendothelioma; it may prevent metastasis dissemination.}},

Abstract = {{The paper offers an answer to one of the most intriguing questions about
   post-communist politics: why did the infrastructure of governance
   deteriorate considerably immediately after the collapse of the old
   regimes in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union? The analysis
   delineates broader themes derived from Charles Tilly's writings on the
   historical sociology of state formation, and brings these themes to bear
   upon the study of post-'89 institutional transformations-a line of
   inquiry that is unjustifiably neglected in mainstream inquiries into the
   causes and manifestations of post-communist `state weakness.' It
   compares post-communism - conceptualized as a historically specific
   period of state building-with earlier episodes of state formation,
   particularly in early modern Europe and thus sheds analytical light on
   the factors that brought about the fluctuation of `stateness' and
   militated against the maintenance of viable state structures in the
   former Soviet world. (c) 2005 The Regents of the University of

Abstract = {{In the past 125 years, more than 70 authors have published ideas for
   keeping time on Mars, describing how to divide the Martian day and
   Martian year into smaller units. The Martian prime meridian was
   established in the mid-19th century, and the design of the Martian clock
   has been standardised at least since the Viking missions of the 1970s.
   Scientists can tell time on Mars; however, despite the constant stream
   of data that is downlinked from Mars these days, there is still no
   standardised system for expressing the date on Mars. Establishing a
   standard epoch-at a specific time of year on Mars, and a specific
   Martian year-should be the next priority in Martian timckeeping as a
   minimal system required for the physical sciences. More elaborate ideas,
   including the number and length of weeks and months, and names thereto,
   can be deferred for the present, but may become important considerations
   in coming years. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas aeruginosa can notably cause both acute and chronic
   infection. While several virulence factors are implicated in the acute
   phase of infection, advances in understanding bacterial pathogenesis
   suggest that chronic P. aeruginosa infection is related to biofilm
   formation. However, the relationship between these two forms of disease
   is not well understood. Accumulating evidence indicates that, during
   acute infection, P. aeruginosa enters epithelial cells, a process viewed
   as either a host-mediated defense response or a pathogenic mechanism to
   avoid host-mediated killing. We investigated the possibility that
   epithelial cell entry during early P. aeruginosa-epithelial cell contact
   favors bacterial survival and is linked to chronic infection. Using
   electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to analyze primary culture
   airway epithelial cells infected with P. aeruginosa, we found that
   epithelial cells developed pod-like clusters of intracellular bacteria
   with regional variation in protein expression. Extracellular gentamicin
   added to the medium after acute infection led to the persistence of
   intracellular P. aeruginosa for at least 3 days. Importantly, compared
   to bacterial culture under planktonic conditions, the intracellular
   bacteria were insensitive to growth inhibition or killing by antibiotics
   that were capable of intraepithelial cell penetration. These findings
   suggest that P. aeruginosa can use airway epithelial cells as a
   sanctuary for persistence and develop a reversible antibiotic resistance
   phenotype characteristic of biofilm physiology that can contribute to
   development of chronic infection.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluid devices are conventionally used for boundary layer control in
   many aerospace applications. Synthetic jets are intense small-scale
   turbulent jets formed from periodic entrainment and expulsion of the
   fluid in which they are embedded. The jets can be made to impinge upon
   electronic components thereby providing forced convection impingement
   cooling. The small size of these devices accompanied by the high exit
   air velocity provides an exciting opportunity to significantly reduce
   the size of thermal management hardware in electronics. A proprietary
   meso scale synthetic jet designed at GE Global Research is able to
   provide a maximum air velocity of 90 m/s from a 0.85 mm hydraulic
   diameter rectangular orifice. An experimental study for determining the
   cooling performance of synthetic jets was carried out by using a single
   jet to cool a thin foil heater The heat transfer augmentation caused by
   the jets depends on several parameters, such as, driving frequency,
   driving voltage, jet axial distance, heater size, and heat flux. During
   the experiments, the operating frequency for the jets was varied between
   3.4 and 5.4 kHz, while the driving voltage was varied between 50 and 90
   V-RMS. Two different heater powers, corresponding to approximately 50
   and 80 degrees C, were tested. A square heater with a surface area of
   156 mm 2 was used to mimic the hot component and detailed temperature
   measurements were obtained with a microscopic infrared thermal imaging
   technique. A maximum heat transfer enhancement of approximately 10 times
   over natural convection was measured. The maximum measured coefficient
   of performance was approximately 3.25 due to the low power consumption
   of the synthetic jets.}},

Abstract = {{There was no macroeconomic policy in the classical system of economic
   thought. Monetary policy was determined without discretion within the
   Gold Standard, and budget outcomes were guided by a `balanced budget
   rule'. Intellectual and policy support for the classical rules
   evaporated when large shocks upset the classical adjustment mechanisms
   and led to high and persistent unemployment. For a number of decades
   after Keynes's general theory, discretionary adjustment of fiscal and
   monetary policy to maintain balance between supply capacity of the
   economy and demand replaced the classical rules. This has now, in turn,
   been replaced by a variation on the classical theme. A `goods and
   services standard, designed to keep inflation steady and low, a freely
   floating exchange rate, and a `small, steady budget surplus' are the
   elements of the new system in Australia. This has worked well enough in
   the particular circumstances of the past one and a half decades, but
   would be vulnerable to a reversal of recent Australian good fortune in
   its terms of trade.}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic analysis is made of an enzymatic reaction with slow-binding
   inhibition in which the enzyme-substrate complex suffers an irreversible

   obtained by solving the system of differential equations describing the
   kinetics of the enzymatic system, under conditions of enzyme limiting
   and assuming an initial steady state and a concentration of inhibitor
   higher than that of the free enzyme. The analytical equations derived
   have been tested by numerical calculus. A kinetic data analysis is
   suggested, which leads to the evaluation of the principal kinetic
   parameters of the reaction. This analysis is based in the progress curve
   of the product of the reaction. We demonstrate the goodness of the
   procedure suggested by computer simulation and illustrate it with a

   minimize the probability of losing all replicas of a given message, then
   the optimal policy is to spread the replicas over time. This is proved
   using convexity properties of the loss probability. On the contrary if
   one wants to minimize the probability of losing at least one replica,
   then the optimal solution is to group all replicas together. This is
   proved by using majorization techniques. Finally we show how these ideas

Abstract = {{We present new results for the three-point correlation function, zeta,
   measured as a function of scale, luminosity and colour from the final
   version of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). The reduced
   three-point correlation function, Q(3)similar to zeta/xi(2) is estimated
   for different triangle shapes and sizes, employing a full covariance
   analysis. The form of Q(3) is consistent with the expectations for the
   Lambda cold dark matter model, confirming that the primary influence
   shaping the distribution of galaxies is gravitational instability acting
   on Gaussian primordial fluctuations. However, we find a clear offset in
   amplitude between Q(3) for galaxies and the predictions for the dark
   matter. We are able to rule out the scenario in which galaxies are
   unbiased tracers of the mass at the 9 sigma level. On weakly non-linear
   scales, we can interpret our results in terms of galaxy bias parameters.
   We find a linear bias term that is consistent with unity,
   b(1)=0.93(-0.08)(+0.10) and a quadratic bias c(2)=b(2)/b(1)=-0.34
   (+0.11)(0.08). This is the first significant detection of a non-zero
   quadratic bias, indicating a small but important non-gravitational
   contribution to the three-point function. Our estimate of the linear
   bias from the three-point function is independent of the normalization
   of underlying density fluctuations, so we can combine this with the
   measurement of the power spectrum of 2dFGRS galaxies to constrain the
   amplitude of matter fluctuations. We find that the rms linear theory
   variance in spheres of radius 8 h(-1) Mpc is sigma(8) =
   0.88(-0.10)(+0.12), providing an independent confirmation of values
   derived from other techniques. On non-linear scales, where xi > 1, we
   find that Q(3) has a strong dependence on scale, colour and luminosity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We investigated the prevalence of single nucleotide
   polymorphisms in the p16 gene (C540G) and the cyclin D1 gene (G870A),
   both known to regulate function in G1 arrest and therefore, may play an
   important role in carcinogenesis. Methods: Using PCR based restriction
   fragment length polymorphism and single strand conformational
   polymorphism, we determined single nucleotide exchanges in the p16 and
   cyclin D1 genes among 56 esophageal adenocarcinomas (ADC) arising in
   Barrett's esophagus, 95 cardiac gastric ADC, and in 191 distal gastric
   ADC. The allelic frequencies were compared to a control group of 253
   healthy blood donors. Results: The C/G genotype of p16 was identified in
   10.4\% of esophageal carcinomas, 13.3\% of cardiac carcinomas, and in
   14.1\% of gastric carcinomas, compared to 17.4\% in the healthy control
   group. All other cases showed the C/C wildtype, as no homozygous G/G
   nucleotide exchange was detected in the group of cancer patients or in
   the control group. In esophageal cancer, cyclin D1 G/G genotype was
   found 28.6\%, A/G in 46.4\%, and A/A in 25.0\%. In cardiac carcinoma,
   frequency of cyclin D1 genotype was 27.4\% for G/G, 57.9\% for A/G, and
   14.7\% for AA. In distal gastric carcinoma, both homozygous genotypes
   (G/G and A/A) had a frequency of 15.2\% each, while the heterozygous A/G
   genotype occurred in 69.6\% of patients. The control group displayed
   24.9\% G/G, 53.8\% A/G, and 21.3\% A/A genotype. Conclusions: Our
   results show that frequencies of p16 or cyclin D1 polymorphisms in
   gastric and esophageal ADC do not differ significantly from the healthy
   control group. Therefore, these polymorphisms are unlikely to be

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Alterations in hepatobiliary transporters may render
   fatty livers more vulnerable against various toxic insults.
   Methods: We therefore studied expression and function of key organic
   anion transporters and their transactivators in 8-week-old obese Zucker
   rats, an established model for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
   Results: Compared to their heterozygous littermates, obese animals
   showed a significant reduction in canalicular bile salt secretion, which
   was paralleled by significantly diminished Oatp2 mRNA and protein levels
   together with reduced nuclear HNF3 beta, while expression of bile salt
   export pump, organic anion transporter (Oatp) 1 and multidrug
   resistance-associated protein (Mrp) 4 were unchanged. Impaired bile
   salt-independent bile flow in obese rats was associated with a 50\%
   reduction of biliary secretion of the Mrp 2 model-substrates glutathione
   disulfide and S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione. In line Mrp2 protein
   expression was reduced by 50\% in obese rats.
   Conclusions: Oatp2 and Mrp2 expression is decreased in fatty liver and
   may impair metabolism and biliary secretion of numerous xenobiotics.
   Reduction of bile salt secretion and absence of biliary GSH excretion
   may contribute to impaired bile flow and posthepatic disorders
   associated with biliary GSH depletion. (c) 2005 European Association for

Abstract = {{The paper reviews selected literature on the theory and practice of
   constructive technology assessment ( CTA), which represents a promising
   approach for managing technology through society. CTA emphasises the
   involvement and interaction of diverse participants to facilitate
   `upstream' ( or anticipatory) learning about possible impacts of
   technology and socially robust decision-making. The paper seeks to
   identify limitations of CTA, as these relate to the broadening of debate
   about nascent, controversial technology. In particular, it considers the
   relevance of CTA to the achievement of more democratic decision-making
   about technology. In addition, the paper directs attention towards
   differences in participants' discursive capacities and rhetorical skills
   that may affect the role and contribution of non-expert citizens in
   technology assessment. The paper draws upon the debate between Habermas
   and Foucault to suggest promising avenues for future research based on
   technology assessment conceptualised as discourse. It concludes that the
   theory and practice of CTA may be improved by addressing explicitly
   possible structural limitations on the broadening of debate, whilst
   invoking a notion of technology assessment as discourse to point up
   cultural, subjective or cognitive limitations on agency.}},

Abstract = {{The authors report a case of a 25-year-old woman with a polytrauma,
   caused by a free fall of 12 metres in suicidal intention. Following
   endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation by an emergency
   physician at the scene, the patient was delivered to the emergency room
   of an university hospital. An ultrasonic check of the abdomen revealed
   free fluid in the abdominal cavity, and a rupture of liver and spleen
   was suspected. Since breath sounds over the right lung were diminished,
   a chest tube was inserted immediately in the fifth intercostal space in
   the anterior axillary line. About 300 millilitres of blood were drained
   by the tube. Shortly thereafter, a laparotomy was performed, where
   spleen and liver rupture were confirmed and treated. After 60 minutes,
   the patient developed severe hypotension coupled with ventricular
   tachycardia and fibrillation, and resuscitation measures had to be
   initiated. Since breath sounds over the right lung were missing, a
   tension pneumothorax was suspected and a thoracotomy performed
   immediately. While huge amounts of air and blood were emerging from the
   thoracic cavity, a rupture of the right mainstem bronchus as well as of
   the right pulmonary artery and vena subclavia was identified. The chest
   tube was found dislocated into the subcutaneous tissue. Despite of open
   heart compression, application of adrenaline and noradrenaline and
   substitution of packed red blood cells and of crystalloid and colloid
   solutions, all resuscitation measures failed so that the patient died
   shortly after on the operation table.
   This case illustrates first the difficulties of an adequate thoracic
   trauma management, particularly, when clinical symptoms are discrete,
   second the problems of the insertion and control of a chest tube, and
   third risks associated with wrong position or secondary dislocation
   which may include-as in our case-{''}masking{''} of severe injury
   patterns and delay of life-saving measures such as an immediate
   thoracotomy.
   In order to improve prognosis of patients with poly-/thoracic trauma,
   establishment of spiral-CT in emergency centres, routine bronchoscopy
   and safe handling of chest tubes may be helpful.}},

Volume = {{201}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{898-905}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Major lower limb amputations continue to be performed at an
   increasing rate, the major cause being the rising prevalence of adult
   onset diabetes. It can be demonstrated that a reduction in amputation
   rate can be achieved at institutes with a higher level of academic and
   specialty interest, by avoiding errors of management and by newer
   technical innovations in wound closure.
   STUDY DESIGN: A simpler method of wound closure that is easily taught
   and learned and is readily available to the medical community and the
   patient population can play a substantial role in reducing the number of
   amputations. Satisfactory closure of open lesions by full-thickness skin
   and subcutaneous tissue carries with it a lower incidence of recurrence,
   reduces costs by avoiding or reducing length of hospitalization, and
   minimizes use of general anesthesia, a serious matter in
   immunocompromised older patients. Avoiding errors of technique will
   additionally reduce amputation rate.
   RESULTS: In the last 10 years, 125 patients, mostly diabetic and
   elderly, with major and recurrent lesions of the lower extremities, have
   been treated by closure of the debrided wound with a combination of
   external tissue expansion and wound toilette. Major lower limb
   amputations have been avoided.
   CONCLUSIONS: Experience confirms that the relationship between high
   hospital volume, specialty interest, higher level of academic care;
   avoiding technical errors; and simplifying the methodology, lead to a
   reduction in need for major amputations. A lower mortality in the
   patient population at risk is achieved and a reduction in costs, which
   have risen beyond the \$132 billion level, can be expected.}},

Abstract = {{New generations of highly maneuverable aircraft, uninhabited combat air
   vehicles or micro air vehicles, are likely to feature very flexible
   lifting surfaces. To enhance the performance and control characteristics
   of these vehicles, the replacement of hinged control surfaces by smart
   wings with morphing airfoils is investigated. This requires a
   fundamental understanding of the interaction between aerodynamics,
   structures, and control systems. The modeling of a smart wing with
   morphing airfoils is described. Trailing-edge flaps for maneuvering are
   replaced by airfoil morphing via distributed structural actuation. The
   goal is to build a model consistent with distributed control and to
   exercise this model to determine the progress possible in terms of
   flight control (lift, drag, and maneuver performance) with an adaptive
   wing. The model is used to study the roll performance and actuation
   power requirements of a smart wing with morphing airfoils. For selected
   flight conditions, actuation power requirements of a smart wing with
   morphing airfoils are compared to those of a conventional wing with

Abstract = {{Experimental findings in neonatal mice demonstrated massive apoptosis

   the use of PB in the treatment of seizures in neonates. We studied 28
   children aged 8-14 years who had received PB as neonates. The children
   underwent the Kaufman ABC test, various questionnaires, and functional
   MRI. `' Best friends `' served as a control group. Some children had an
   underlying disease independent of PB medication. With the exception of
   five children, all attended a regular school, three even the higher
   branch of the German school system and four the middle branch. Ten
   children are athletes, five children have demanding hobbies, and four
   children suffer from ADHD (but attend a regular school). The fMRI
   findings revealed small differences between children treated with PB and
   healthy controls as to the activation of the right frontal gyrus. If
   massive apoptosis had been induced by PB, some kind of impairment should
   be expected. Our finding that even prematures < 1000 g (four children)
   can perform perfectly well in regular school contradicts the view that
   PB is as dangerous in humans as it is in rodents.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In orbifold compactifications on T-2/Z(2) with Scherk-Schwarz
   supersymmetry breaking, it is shown that (brane-localised)
   superpotential interactions and (bulk) gauge interactions generate at
   one-loop higher derivative counterterms to the mass of the brane (or
   zero-mode of the bulk) scalar field. These brane-localised operators are
   generated by integrating out the bulk modes of the initial theory which,
   although supersymmetric, is nevertheless non-renormalisable. It is
   argued that such operators, of non-perturbative origin and not protected
   by non-renormalisation theorems, are generic in orbifold
   compactifications and play a crucial role in the UV behaviour of the
   two-point Green function of the scalar field self-energy. Their presence
   in the action with unknown coefficients prevents one from making
   predictions about physics at (momentum) scales close to/above the
   compactification scale(s). Our results extend to the case of two
   dimensional orbifolds, previous findings for S-1/Z(2) and
   S-1/(Z(2)xZ(2)') compactifications where brane-localised higher
   derivative operators are also dynamically generated at loop level,
   regardless of the details of the supersymmetry breaking mechanism. We
   stress the importance of these operators for the hierarchy and the
   cosmological constant problems in compactified theories.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of a pulsed low-energy electron beam on
   bacteria has been explored. The experiment has been carried out using an
   electron beam with a pulse duration of 5 mu s and an acceleration
   voltage of 80 kV. It is shown that homogeneous irradiation with an
   electron beam decontaminates surfaces. Completely Sterilization is
   achieved at a low concentration of bacteria. With increasing
   concentration of bacteria or for a wet target, the survivability of a
   microorganism increases. A spectroscopic experiment and also scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the low-energy electron beam
   does not break the outer structure of a bacterial cell and that bacteria
   inactivation occurs through internal chemical or genetic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Chk2 is a serine/threonine kinase that signals to cell cycle arrest, DNA
   repair, and apoptotic pathways following DNA damage. It is activated by
   phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation, UV light, stalled
   replication forks, and other types of DNA damage. Hypoxia is a common
   feature of solid tumors and has been shown to affect the regulation of
   many genes, including several DNA repair factors. We show here that Chk2
   is phosphorylated on Thr68 and thereby activated in cells in response to
   hypoxia, and that this phosphorylation is dependent on the damage
   response kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) but not on the
   related kinase ATM and Rad3-related. Moreover, phosphorylation of Chk2
   under hypoxia was attenuated in cells deficient in the repair factors
   MLH1 or NBS1. Finally, Chk2 serves to protect cells from apoptosis under
   hypoxic growth conditions. These results identify hypoxia as a new
   stimulus for Chk2 activation in an ATM-, MLHI-, and NBSI-dependent
   manner, and they suggest a novel pathway by which tumor hypoxia may
   influence cell survival and DTNA repair. (Cancer Res 2005; 65(23):

Abstract = {{Unlike homologous muscles in many vertebrates, which appear to function
   similarly during a particular mode of locomotion (e.g. red muscle in
   swimming fish, pectoralis muscle in flying birds, limb extensors in
   jumping and swimming frogs), a major knee extensor in mammalian
   quadrupeds, the vastus lateralis, appears to operate differently in
   different species studied to date. In rats, the vastus undergoes more
   stretching early in stance than shortening in later stance. In dogs, the
   reverse is true; more substantial shortening follows small amounts of
   initial stretching. And in horses, while the vastus strain trajectory is
   complex, it is characterized mainly by shortening during stance. In this
   study, we use sonomicrometry and electromyography to study the vastus
   lateralis and biceps femoris of goats, with three goals in mind: (1) to
   see how these muscles work in comparison to homologous muscles studied
   previously in other taxa; (2) to address how speed and gait impact
   muscle actions and (3) to test whether fascicles in different parts of
   the same muscle undergo similar length changes. Results indicate that
   the biceps femoris undergoes substantial shortening through much of
   stance, with higher strains in walking and trotting {[}32-33\% resting
   length (L-0)] than galloping (22\% L-0). These length changes occur with
   increasing biceps EMG intensities as animals increase speed from walking
   to galloping. The vastus undergoes a stretch-shorten cycle during
   stance. Stretching strains are higher during galloping (15\% L-0) than
   walking and trotting (9\% L-0). Shortening strains follow a reverse
   pattern and are greatest in walking (24\% L-0), intermediate in trotting
   (20\% L-0) and lowest during galloping (17\% L-0). As a result, the
   ratio of stretching to shortening increases from below 0.5 in walking
   and trotting to near 1.0 during galloping. This increasing ratio
   suggests that the vastus does relatively more positive work than energy
   absorption at the slower speeds compared with galloping, although an
   understanding of the timing and magnitude of force production is
   required to confirm this. Length-change regimes in proximal, middle and
   distal sites of the vastus are generally comparable, suggesting strain
   homogeneity through the muscle. When strain rates are compared across
   taxa, vastus shortening velocities exhibit the scaling pattern predicted
   by theoretical and empirical work: fascicles shorten relatively faster
   in smaller animals than larger animals (strain rates near 2 L s(-1) have
   been reported for trotting dogs and were found here for goats, versus
   0.6-0.8 L s(-1) reported in horses). Interestingly, biceps shortening
   strain rates are very similar in both goats and rats during walking
   (1-1.5 L s(-1)) and trotting (1.5-2.5 L s(-1), depending on speed of
   trot), suggesting that the ratio of in vivo shortening velocities (V) to
   maximum shortening velocities (V-max) is smaller in small animals
   (because of their higher V-max).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Helicobacter pylori eradication was recommended for the
   prevention of atrophic gastritis in gastroesophageal reflux disease
   (GERD) patients on long-term omeprazole treatment. It has been also
   shown that the treatment with proton pump inhibitors produces lower
   intragastric pH after H. pylori eradication in subjects with peptic
   ulcer and healthy individuals. The aim of the present study was to test
   the hypothesis of whether the efficacy of lansoprazole is reduced after
   the eradication of H. pylori in GERD patients with peptic esophagitis.
   Methods: Eight-hour intragastric pH recordings were performed before and
   after an 8-day course of lansoprazole (30 mg once daily) in 10 H.
   pylori-positive male patients with reflux esophagitis and were repeated
   after the H. pylori eradication. Intragastric acidity was measured by
   using an antimony electrode placed 10 cm below the cardia.
   Results: Baseline median preprandial, post-prandial, total intragastric
   pH and the percentage of time with pH < 3 were not different before and
   after H. pylori eradication without lansoprazole treatment. During
   lansoprazole treatment, median post-prandial intragastric pH was lower
   (4 vs 2.7; P < 0.05) and the percentage of time with pH < 3 was longer
   (3.4\%vs 41.8\%; P < 0.05) after H. pylori eradication. Median total
   intragastric pH tended to be lower after eradication but no difference
   was found in preprandial median pH.
   Conclusions: In patients with reflux esophagitis treated with
   lansoprazole, intragastric pH increased significantly when H. pylori was
   present, especially in the post-prandial period, whereas baseline pH
   remained unchanged after H. pylori eradication. (C) 2005 Blackwell

Abstract = {{The paper considers a generalized economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ)
   model with stochastic machine breakdown and repair in which the time to
   machine failure, corrective and preventive repair times are all assumed
   to be random variables. The model is formulated under general failure
   and general repair time distributions, treating the machine production
   rate (speed) as a decision variable. As the stress condition of the
   machine changes with the production rate, the failure rate is assumed to
   be dependent on the production rate. The model is further extended to
   the case where certain safety stocks are hold in inventory to protect
   against possible stockout during machine repair. The solution procedure
   and computational algorithms of the associated constrained optimization
   problems are provided. Numerical examples are taken to determine the
   optimal production policies by the proposed algorithms and examine the
   sensitivity of the model parameters.
   Several economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) models for unreliable
   manufacturing systems have been developed in the literature even for
   general failure and general repair (corrective) time distributions. In
   these studies, preventive repair has not been considered in a general
   way and efforts have been made to derive the production control and
   maintenance policy for inflexible manufacturing systems, where the
   machine capacity is pre-determined. The purpose of this article is to
   formulate a generalized EMQ model for a flexible unreliable
   manufacturing system in which (i) the time to machine failure and repair
   (corrective and preventive) times follow general probability
   distributions and (ii) the machine failure rate is dependent on the
   production rate. Consideration of a variable production rate makes the
   model hard to analyze completely. So, attempt has also been made to get
   into its computational aspects by developing solution algorithms. (c)

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Data about the consequences of laparoscopic adjustable
   gastric banding (LAGB) on phospho-calcic and bone metabolism remain
   scarce.
   SUBJECTS: We studied a group of 37 obese premenopausal women (age: 24-52
   y; mean BMI 43.7 kg/m(2)) who underwent LAGB.
   METHODS: Serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, parathormone
   (PTH), vitamin D-3, serum C-telopeptides, IGFBP-3 and IGF-1 were
   measured at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgery. Body
   composition, bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD) were measured
   using dual-X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months
   after surgery.
   RESULTS: There was no clinically significant decrease of calcemia; PTH
   remained stable. Serum telopeptides increased by 100\% (P < 0.001) and
   serum IGFBP-3 decreased by 16\% (P < 0.001) during the first 6 months,
   and then stabilized, whereas IGF-1 remained stable over the 2 y. BMC and
   BMD decreased, especially at the femoral neck; this decrease was
   significantly correlated with the decrease of waist and hip
   circumference.
   CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that there was no evidence of secondary
   hyperparathyroidism 24 months after LAGB. The observed bone resorption
   could be linked to the decrease of IGFBP-3, although this decrease could
   be attributable to other confounding factors. Serum telopeptides seem to
   be a reliable marker of bone metabolism after gastric banding. DXA must
   be interpreted cautiously during major weight loss, because of the
   artefacts caused by the important variation of fat tissue after LAGB.}},

Abstract = {{Under conditions of an increasing scarcity of reviewer tithe, a `remote

   might be an easier and cheaper solution. This paper explores the impact

   Quality Review of the Australian National University. A taylorisation of
   the review process was observed that split the roles Of designing the
   process, assessing the research, synthesising results, and taking
   responsibility for the outcome of the assessment. This taylorisation of
   the assessment process, the heterogeneity of individual assessment

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the use of a variational framework to model fluid
   wetting dynamics. The central problem of infinite energy dissipation for
   a moving contact line is dealt with explicitly rather than by
   introducing a specific microscopic mechanism which removes it. We
   analyze this modelling approach in the context of the quasi-steady
   limit, where contact line motion is slower than bulk relaxation. We find
   that global effects enter into Tanner-type laws which relate line
   velocity to apparent contact angle through the role that energy
   dissipation plays in the bulk of the fluid. A comparison is made to the
   dynamics of lubrication equations that include attractive and repulsive
   intermolecular interactions. A Galerkin-type approximation method is
   introduced which leads to reduced-dimensional dynamical descriptions.
   Computations are conducted using these low-dimensional approximations,
   and a substantial connection to lubrication equation dynamics is found.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different
   modalities of individualized active recovery on blood lactate
   disappearance after supramaximal exercise in subjects with different
   levels of aerobic fitness. Fourteen healthy subjects (7 trained and 7
   untrained subjects mean age 20 +/- 1.5 and 19.5 +/- 1.5, respectively)
   participated in this Study. They performed three supramaximal
   intermittent exercises at 60\% of the time to exhaustion at 120\% of the
   maximum aerobic power (MAP) with 5-min recovery periods (2 x 5 min). The
   third exercise was followed by 20 min of recovery. The effects of four
   types of recovery were compared in trained and untrained subjects:
   passive recovery (PR), an active recovery at an intensity corresponding
   to the first anaerobic ventilatory threshold minus 20\% (VT1), an active
   recovery at an intensity corresponding to the second anaerobic
   ventilatory threshold minus 20\% (VT2) and a combined active recovery
   (CR) which consisted of 7 min at VT2 followed by 13 min at VT1. Blood
   lactate levels were measured at rest and during the recovery periods.
   Peak blood lactate after supramaximal exercise was observed
   significantly earlier with VT2 and CR (4th min) than VT1 and PR (7th
   min) in trained and in untrained subjects. Combined active recovery (CR)
   showed a significantly faster lactate disappearance than did PR, VT1, or
   VT2 from the 7th min of recovery in trained subjects (p < 0.05) and at
   the 20th min in untrained subjects (p < 0.05). CR and VT2 conditions
   showed earlier peak blood lactate (4th min) than PR or VT1 (7th min).
   Blood lactate disappearance was faster in trained than untrained
   subjects during combined active recovery. This result suggests that the
   level of physical fitness plays an important role mainly in the pattern
   of blood lactate decrease during combined active recovery.}},

   Although several treatment modalities, such as tricyclic antidepressants

   different symptoms, there is no definite treatment for narcolepsy.
   Modafinil or amphetamine-like stimulants, such as dexamphetamine or
   methylphenidate, are used to treat sleepiness. Our case was a
   58-year-old woman who was diagnosed as narcolepsy cataplexy syndrome.
   Her Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score was 14 and Beck Depression
   Inventory (BDI) score was 29 in the first evaluation. Imipramine and
   modafinil were begun for the treatment, but there was no improvement in
   her symptoms. Subsequently, bupropion was started at 150 mg/day and then
   dosage was increased to 300 mg/day. She was asymptomatic at the end of 3
   months. To our knowledge, this is the second depressive narcoleptic

Abstract = {{Objective: We Studied a large cohort of identical twin sisters,
   utilizing the unique properties of a twin research design to explore the
   relationship between obstetrical delivery mode and stress urinary
   incontinence.
   Study design: An anonymous 67-item survey was completed by 271 identical
   twin pairs (n = 542) at the world's largest annual gathering of twins.
   Logistic regression for repeated binary measures was used to evaluate
   risk factors and accounting for shared genetics within pairs.
   Results: The twins had a mean age of 47.1 years (range 15 to 85 years),
   and stress urinary incontinence was reported by 51.8\%. Stress urinary
   incontinence was associated with age (P = .001), parity (P = .001),
   obesity (P = .002), and birth mode, with vaginal delivery conferring a
   considerable increase in stress urinary incontinence risk relative to
   cesarean section (odds ratio 2.28, 95\% confidence interval 1.14 to
   4.55, P =.019).
   Conclusion: Vaginal delivery mode represents a potent determinant of
   stress urinary incontinence, carrying more than twice the risk of
   cesarean section. This study of identical twins provides new insight
   into the epidemiology of female incontinence. (c) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All

Title = {{Upper-extremity phocomelia reexamined: A longitudinal dysplasia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{87A}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2639-2648}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: In contrast to longitudinal deficiencies, phocomelia is
   considered a transverse, intercalated segmental dysplasia. Most patients
   demonstrate severe, but not otherwise classifiable, upper-extremity
   deformities, which usually cannot be placed into one of three previously
   described phocomelia groups. Additionally, these phocomelic extremities
   do not demonstrate true segmental deficits; the limb is also abnormal
   proximal and distal to the segmental defect. The purpose of this
   investigation was to present evidence that upper-extremity abnormalities
   in patients previously diagnosed as having phocomelia in fact represent
   a proximal continuum of radial or ulnar longitudinal dysplasia.
   Methods: The charts and radiographs of forty-one patients (sixty
   extremities) diagnosed as having upper-extremity phocomelia were
   reviewed retrospectively. On the basis of the findings on the
   radiographs, the disorders were categorized into three groups: (1)
   proximal radial longitudinal dysplasia, which was characterized by an
   absent proximal part of the humerus, a nearly normal distal part of the
   humerus, a completely absent radius, and a radial-sided hand dysplasia;
   (2) proximal ulnar longitudinal dysplasia, characterized by a short
   one-bone upper extremity that bifurcated distally and by severe hand
   abnormalities compatible with ulnar dysplasia; and (3) severe combined
   dysplasia, with type A characterized by an absence of the forearm
   segment (i.e., the radius and ulna) and type B characterized by absence
   of the arm and forearm (i.e., the hand attached to the thorax).
   Results: Twenty-nine limbs in sixteen patients could be classified as
   having proximal radial longitudinal dysplasia. Systemic medical
   conditions such as thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome were common
   in those patients, but additional musculoskeletal conditions were rare.
   Twenty limbs in seventeen patients could be classified as having
   proximal ulnar longitudinal dysplasia. Associated musculoskeletal
   abnormalities, such as proximal femoral focal deficiency, were common in
   those patients. Eleven limbs in ten patients were identified as having
   severe combined dysplasia, which was type A in seven of them and type B
   in four. Four patients with severe combined dysplasia had congenital
   cardiac anomalies, and four had associated musculoskeletal
   abnormalities. Three of the four patients with the type-B disorder had a
   contralateral ulnar longitudinal dysplasia.
   Conclusions: We propose that cases previously classified as
   upper-extremity phocomelia represent a spectrum of severe longitudinal
   dysplasia, as none of the sixty extremities that we studied demonstrated
   a true intercalary deficiency. These findings have both developmental
   and genetic implications.
   Level of Evidence: Diagnostic Level II. See Instructions to Authors for
   a complete description of levels of evidence.}},

Abstract = {{The re-interpretation of surface karst landforms in Northern England has
   led to a re-examination of well-known erratic-pedestal sites that were
   the origin for karst denudation rates applied extensively, on the
   supposition that erratics protect underlying limestone from rainwater
   solution. Height of the pedestal has been used to calculate long-term
   solutional-lowering, as much as 50 cm in 15 ka (33.3 mm/ka) from UK
   sites. The sites include Norber and Scar Close, Yorkshire, UK. This
   paper shows that the sites have been misinterpreted, in particular at
   Norber where the erratics lie on a pre-existing structurally stepped
   surface. Norber and several other sites also experience much mechanical
   weathering, in relatively weak, well-fractured limestones, a process
   which must be distinguished from solution. Sites in strong,
   less-fractured limestones demonstrate lower rates, which are sounder
   indications of land surface lowering. Some pedestals have been confirmed
   as partly resulting from solutional weathering in surrounding soil and
   vegetation. Re-evaluation reduces solution rates to 3-13 cm in 15 ka.
   Applying such rates has profound implications for understanding
   limestone landscapes, challenging orthodox views.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To compare orally administered esomeprazole 40 mg once daily
   and 20 mg once daily with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily for the healing
   of gastric ulcers (GUs) during 8 wks in patients who continued to
   receive daily nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy.
   METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group
   trial included patients who were receiving nonselective or
   cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)-selective NSAIDs and had at least one GU >= 5
   mm but no gastric or duodenal ulcer > 25 mm in diameter at the baseline
   esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). After 4 and 8 wks of treatment,
   ulcer-healing status was confirmed by EGD. The primary outcome was the
   percentage of patients in each treatment group who had no GUs (GU
   healing rate) at week 8.
   RESULTS: A total of 406 patients were randomized to treatment. At week
   8, GU healing rates with esomeprazole 40 and 20 mg were 91.5\% (118/129;
   95\% CI, 86.7-96.3\%) and 88.4\% (122/138; 95\% CI, 83.1-93.7\%),

   respectively) were also significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in the
   ranitidine group (66.7\%{[}88/132]). All treatments were well tolerated.
   CONCLUSIONS: Esomeprazole 40 and 20 mg once daily are effective and
   well-tolerated therapies compared with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily for
   healing GUs in patients who need to continue NSAID therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilatory peptide
   present in central and peripheral neurons, is released at inflammatory
   sites and inhibits several macrophage, dendritic cell, and lymphocyte
   functions. In the present study, we investigated the role of CGRP in
   models of local and systemic acute inflammation and on macrophage
   activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Intraperitoneal
   pretreatment with synthetic CGRP reduces in approximately 50\% the
   number of neutrophils in the blood and into the peritoneal cavity 4 h
   after LPS injection. CGRP failed to inhibit neutrophil recruitment
   induced by the direct chemoattractant platelet-activating factor,
   whereas it significantly inhibited LPS-induced KC generation, suggesting
   that the effect of CGRP on neutrophil recruitment is indirect, acting on
   chemokine production by resident cells. Pretreatment of mice with 1 mu g
   of CGRP protects against a lethal dose of LPS. The CGRP-induced
   protection is receptor mediated because it is completely reverted by the
   CGRP receptor antagonist, CGRP 8-37. The protective effect of CGRP
   correlates with an inhibition of TNF-alpha and an induction of IL-6 and
   IL-10 in mice sera 90 min after LPS challenge. Finally, CGRP
   significantly inhibits LPS-induced TNF-alpha released from mouse
   peritoneal macrophages. These results suggest that activation of the
   CGRP receptor on macrophages during acute inflammation could be part of
   the negative feedback mechanism controlling the extension of acute
   inflammatory responses.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers have reported that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor
   (sBDNF) of drug-free depressed patients are lower than those of healthy
   controls and proposed that low sBDNF levels might reflect failure of
   neuronal plasticity in depression. In this study, we compared sBDNF
   levels of depressed patients (n = 28) before and after 8 weeks of
   antidepressant treatment, with those of healthy controls (n = 18) to
   test the hypothesis that initially low sBDNF levels of drug-free
   depressed patients will increase parallel with their clinical response
   to antidepressant treatment. The severity of depression and response to
   treatment were assessed with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
   (HAM-D). sBDNF was assayed with the sandwich ELISA method. Baseline
   sBDNF levels of patients (mean, 20.8 ng/ml; {[}S.D., 6.7]) were
   significantly lower than those of controls (mean, 26.8 ng/ml; {[}S.D.,
   9.3]; p = 0.015), and were negatively correlated with HAM-D scores (r =
   -0.49, p = 0.007). After 8 weeks of treatment, sBDNF levels of patients
   had increased significantly (mean, 33.3 ng/ml; {[}S.D., 9.9]; p < 0.001)
   and no longer differed from those of controls. These results support the
   hypothesis that BDNF might play a critical role in the pathophysiology
   of major depressive disorder and successful antidepressant treatment
   increases the attenuated BDNF levels in depressed patients.}},

   modular architecture composed of several neural networks. Using
   reinforcement learning, a second neural network based model optimizes
   the position and orientation of the hand palm taking into account noisy
   sensing information. Working together these two modules exchange
   information to define the complete hand configuration. In order to
   illustrate the capabilities of the proposed model, simulation results

Title = {{Demographic variables related to depression: Differences between males
   and females living in low income urban-areas}},
Journal = {{SALUD MENTAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{33-40}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper is aimed at exploring the relationship of some
   sociodemographic variables with the presence of depressive disorders
   among a low-income urban sample. Different variables have consistently
   been associated with such disorders, for instance, marital status, sex,
   and socio-economic status.
   As to marital Status, some studies show that married people have better
   health conditions and feel more satisfied with their lives than their
   unmarried counterparts. Similarly, it has been found that widowed or
   divorced people present a number of psychological problems.
   Low-income population is also at high risk of suffering depressive
   symptoms, in this sense, some researchers have stated that the lack of
   resources is associated with sadness, high stress levels, isolation,
   uncertainty, and low access to health care and/or other Sources of
   support.
   According to the Mexican National Survey on Mental Health conducted With
   urban population over 18, the prevalence of depressive disorders is
   higher among widowers and divorced individuals -both males and females-
   than among their married counterparts. In addition, an association was
   found between depression, low schooling and unemployment.
   A survey undertaken in Mexico City yielded similar results though gender
   differences were not explored; higher prevalences of depression were
   found for those who reported having lost their Couple or marital break
   LIP than for those who were married or single. Other groups that had
   high depression prevalence were lower income individuals, and those with
   less schooling.
   Couple relationships and other socio-demographic variables play a key
   role in the presence of depressive disorders. Thus, the present Study is
   aimed at: a) analysing how marital status affects the presence of
   depressive disorders in men and women; b) exploring the role of low
   socio-economic level in the presence of depressive symptoms; c)
   exploring which combination of sociodemographic variables better predict
   the presence of depressive disorder in males and females.
   Method: This research was carried Out in four low-income communities
   located in southern Mexico City. The selected communities include
   Topilejo, Isidro Fabela and San Pedro Martir within the Tlalpan
   district, and the fourth community was Constituted by the neighbourhoods
   of San Marcos and San Juan, in the Xochimilco district.
   The research design was multistage; blocks were selected at the first
   stage, dwelling segments, at second stage, and finally, ill the third
   stage the interviewed individual was selected. After this procedure, the
   Final sample consisted of 1156 interviewees, 49\% were males and 51\%,
   females.
   The information was gathered through a household questionnaire that
   explores the general characteristics of the people living in the same
   dwelling Listed on the questionnaire, Such as relationship to the Family
   head, age, sex, schooling and income. Some other aspects related to the
   dwelling characteristics were also explored.
   Diagnosis of depressive disorder was obtained through the diagnostic
   interview CID] version 1.1, which assesses the presence of mental
   disorders according to the criteria of the International Classification
   of Diseases (ICD) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
   Disorders (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association.
   The selected interviewees participated volunatrily after the research
   objectives were explained; in addition, the terms of confidentiality
   were Particularly emphasized. Each interview lasted 90 minutes on
   average. Data analysis were performed with the statistical program SPSS
   v. 10 for Windows.
   Results: The findings showed higher prevalence of depressive disorders
   among females, among people that experienced loss or family rupture and
   among those with lower econornic resources. Similarly, prevalence of
   depression was higher for men (6.1\%) and women (18.3\%) who had lost
   their Spouse than for their married Counterpart. As to differences
   between married and single people, the prevalence of depressive
   disorders in the group of men that had ever married was lower (4.9\%)
   than the prevalence found in the group of married men (5.8\%). The
   opposite was observed among females, since single women present more
   depressive problems (13.2\%) than married women (5.3\%).
   Results also showed how economic difficulties have an effect on the
   presence of depressive disorders. However, differences between married
   and single men with the lowest income were minimal.
   Two logistic regression models show that, particularly among women, the
   presence of depressive disorder is related to the lack of a couple,
   economic disadvantages; for instance, low family income, belonging to a
   large extended family and playing the social role of family head,,which
   implies responsibility to a large extent.
   Discussion: The findings of the present study are consistent with
   previous research that report higher prevalence of depression among
   females, People without a couple and those with less economic resources.
   Different authors have confirmed that problems of economic nature are
   consistently associated with depression problems. Lack of resources
   leads to high stress levels, sadness, isolation, among other troubles.
   This situation is more severe for females. Women play a number of social
   roles that put them at higher risk of suffering mental disorders.
   Nowadays, women still bear the responsibility of being wives, mothers,
   educators and care providers for many people, and have become an
   important part of the work force at the same time.
   The deficiencies that female family heads Must face in different areas
   not only increase the risk of suffering disorders such as depression and
   poor quality Of life, but also jeopardize their children's opportunities
   in the future.
   Dejarlais and colleagues suggest that in order to improve these women's
   oriental health it is necessary to take actions in two ways. On the one
   hand, it is essential to deal with the factors related to the presence
   of female distress; on the other, it is crucial to provide attention to
   reduce the negative consequences.
   In this way, any prevention or intervention program Must include, among
   other elements, tools to expand women's capabilities to have an income,
   reinforce social Support networks, and to stimulate Social and community
   participation in order to improve their cognitive and relational
   resources as well as self-esteem.
   In addition, women must have information about the pathological process
   they undergo and attention Options at their disposal, but to make these
   programs effective it is above all necessary to tailor them according to
   women's concerns and needs. This can only be possible if women act as
   active collaborators.
   Finally, to work on intervention and prevention programs for female
   family heads encloses the possibility of breaking the cycle that
   reproduces distress among their children.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The displaced proximal humeral fracture continues to be a
   problem and remains the ``unsolved fracture{''}. Many guidelines for
   surgical treatment of different types of these fractures have been
   described. A conservative functional therapy is recommended as well as a
   closed or open reposition and internal fixation. Other authors prefer
   the primary prosthetic replacement of the displaced humeral head. The
   purpose of this article is to describe a minimal invasive technique-the
   intramedullary titanium helix wire-and to analyse results and specific
   problems of this method compared to other techniques. Materials and
   methods: In a prospective study done over a period of 5 years from 1998
   to 2002, 97 patients with two-, three- and four-part-fractures of the
   proximal humerus were treated with the intramedullary titanium helix
   wire and given follow-up clinical and radiological checks after 12
   months. The functional outcome was evaluated with a 1-year follow-up in
   95 of 97 patients. Results: Our 1-year results include: 41 very good, 24
   good, 16 satisfactory, 14 poor (average 76 points Constant functional
   score, 30.7 points UCLA score). Conclusion: The advantages of the method
   arising from the results lie in both the simple operation approach
   without nerve lesions or wound infections, and also in the indirect,
   intramedullary splinting of the fracture without damage to the
   surrounding soft parts, while iatrogenic necroses of the humeral head
   can be avoided.}},

   looks at the role of establishment-specific factors-such as sectoral

   gender wage gap literature is applied to breakdown the East-West wage
   gap into its constituent components. Using establishment data from

Abstract = {{The Australian farming sector is continuing to intensify, particularly
   within 300 km of the east and southern coastlines. In the future there
   will be fewer and larger farms, which will use more fertilizer, support
   more stock, grow more monoculture crops, and utilise more marginal
   soils. This is likely to increase the major environmental impacts of
   soil degradation, salt, nutrient and sediment contamination of
   waterways, and greenhouse gas emissions. Australian national water
   policy continues to focus on land, stream and groundwater salinity
   issues, although there is now a greater recognition of the importance of
   nitrogen and phosphorus losses from agriculture. The general philosophy
   of policy for dealing with nonpoint source pollution has been towards a
   voluntary rather than regulatory approach, with state and national
   governments supporting a range of programs to encourage sustainable
   agricultural practices. A catchment (watershed) based approach, through
   the use of integrated catchment management plans, is the primary way
   that non-point source pollution is addressed at the farm and local
   level. At an industry level, cotton, grains, meat, sugarcane and dairy
   amongst others, as well as the Australian fertilizer industry, have
   responded to non-point source issues by investing in research and
   development, and developing codes of practice aimed at abating these
   environmental impacts. Understanding the economic, social, political and
   cultural contexts of farming as well as the environmental impacts of
   agriculture are very important in determining the appropriateness of
   policy responses for Australian farming systems.}},

   results permitted the determination of the Delta(Delta S-double dagger)
   in each proton-bound pair. For the (CH3CN)(CH3OH)H+ and

   for the propanol-containing pairs ranged between 40 and 45 J K-1

   location of the dividing surface in each dissociation and the rapidity
   with the frequencies of the vanishing vibrational modes go to zero as
   they are converted to product translations and rotations during the
   dissociation.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the prevalence of endoparasites and their association with
   diarrhea, a survey was conducted in the Southern Province of Zambia that
   used conventional and molecular techniques applied to stool and urine
   samples from school-age children (n=93). Almost half of the stools
   (49.5\%) were diarrhetic. The overall prevalence of Endolimax nana,

   stercoralis was 64.3, 59.1, 53.8, 19.4, 8.6, 8.6, and 1.1\%,
   respectively. Only the associations between infection with B. hominis
   and E. nana with diarrhea were statistically significant. Although B.
   hominis and E. nana are considered to be nonpathogenic organisms, this
   study demonstrated that they can be associated with diarrhea in children
   when they occur at high prevalence and intensity. This survey supports
   the recent evidence that B. hominis and E. nana infections are
   associated with deficient sanitation and low hygiene standards and can
   contribute to diarrhea in children in developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we reported significantly reduced pain and improved mobility
   persisting for 6 months after kyphoplasty of chronically painful
   osteoporotic vertebral fractures in the first prospective controlled

   vertebral morphology may affect the incidence of fracture, long-term
   clinical benefit and thereby cost-effectiveness, here we extend our
   previous work to assess occurrence of new vertebral fractures and
   clinical parameters 1 year after kyphoplasty compared with a
   conservatively treated control group. Sixty patients with osteoporotic
   vertebral fractures due to primary osteoporosis were included: 40
   patients were treated with kyphoplasty, 20 served as controls. All
   patients received standard medical treatment. Morphological
   characteristics, new vertebral fractures, pain (visual analog scale),
   physical function {[}European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study (EVOS) score]
   (range 0-100 each) and back-pain-related doctors' visits were
   re-assessed 12 months after kyphoplasty. There were significantly fewer
   patients with new vertebral fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine,
   after 12-months, in the kyphoplasty group than in the control group
   (P=0.0084). Pain scores improved from 26.2 to 44.4 in the kyphoplasty
   group and changed from 33.6 to 34.3 in the control group (P=0.008).
   Kyphoplasty treated patients required a mean of 5.3 back-pain-related
   doctors' visits per patient compared with 11.6 in the control group
   during 12 months follow-up (P=0.006). Kyphoplasty as an addition to
   medical treatment and when performed in appropriately selected patients
   by an interdisciplinary team persistently improves pain and reduces
   occurrence of new vertebral fractures and healthcare utilization for at
   least 12 months in individuals with primary osteoporosis.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of linezolid
   versus teicoplanin in the treatment of bacteremia produced by
   Gram-positive microorganisms through a pharmacoeconomic analysis based
   on clinical results obtained from a previous clinical trial.
   We applied an analysis of cost-effectiveness elaborated through a
   pharmacoeconomic model. We defined each unit of effectiveness as `each
   successfully cured of infections with bacteremia.' We used the program
   Pharma-Decision (version Hospital 1.1) that allows to build interactive
   pharmacoeconomic models. Effectiveness data of both antibiotics were
   obtained from a published clinical trial, while resources consumed were
   obtained from the same source and from a consensus provided by a local
   expert panel. Only direct costs were included in the analysis without
   taking into consideration indirect costs. The perspective chosen was
   hospital assistance and the time horizon was set to 28 days. All costs
   are expressed in Euros.
   Linezolid demonstrated a better clinical outcome with less associated
   costs compared to teicoplanin (88.5 versus 56.7\% of cured patients and
   5,557.04 versus 6,327.43 Euro per treated patient, respectively), thus
   resulting in a lower cost-effectiveness ratio for linezolid versus
   teicoplanin (6,279.1 versus 11,159.5 Euro per cured patient with a 95\%
   CI of 5,960.2-6,510.4 and 10,865.2-12,647.3, respectively) which results
   in a the dominant position for linezolid. The sensitivity analysis
   showed that linezolid was always the most efficient option even when
   modifying the value of variables with higher uncertainty.
   Linezolid is a more efficient option than teicoplanin because it
   presents higher rate of effectiveness with lower consumption of
   resources, thus being a dominant alternative in the treatment of
   Gram-positive infection with bacteremia.}},

   technical specifications and scientific objectives are described; these
   included panoramic 3-colour imaging to characterise the landing site;
   multi-spectral imaging to study the mineralogy of rocks and soils beyond
   the reach of the arm and solar observations to measure water vapour
   absorption and the atmospheric dust optical density. Also envisaged were
   stellar observations to determine the lander location and orientation,
   multi-spectral observations of Phobos \& Deimos and observations of the
   landing site to monitor temporal changes. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Study Design. Lower lumbar vertebral endplates from young and old sand
   rats were assessed in an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
   approved study for architectural endplate features using
   micro-computerized tomography (CT) 3-dimensional (3D) models and
   vascularization studies by an in vivo vascular tracer or
   immunocytochemical identification of blood vessels.
   Objective. To assess endplate porosity and vascularization using mu CT
   architectural analysis, an in vivo vascular tracer, and
   immunocytochemical identification of blood vessels in the endplate.
   Summary of the Background Data. The vertebral endplates, also called
   cartilage endplates, form the superior and inferior, or cranial and
   caudal, boundaries of the disc. In the human being and sand rat, the
   cartilaginous endplate undergoes calcification with aging and is
   replaced by bone. Endplate sclerosis has long been thought to play a
   role in disc degeneration by decreasing nutrient availability to the
   disc, but this is still poorly understood. Previous work has identified
   increasing bone mineral density with aging and disc degeneration in the
   sand rat model.
   Methods. mu CT models of the lower lumbar endplates of vertebrae at L5 -
   6 and L6 - 7 were constructed from 6 younger (mean age 11 months) and 21
   older (mean age 25.6 months) sand rats. Architectural features were
   scored on a semiquantitative scale for smoothness of the endplate face,
   irregularities on the endplate margin, and endplate thickness. There
   were 2 smaller sets of animals (n = 18) evaluated for endplate
   vascularity following in vivo injection of a fluorescent vascular tracer
   or by the use of immunocytochemistry to identify blood vessels.
   Results. mu CT revealed a solid bony surface to the endplate, which was
   not penetrated by vasculature; with aging/disc degeneration, there was
   roughening and pitting of the plate surface, and the development of
   irregular margins. In L5 - 6 and L6 - 7, sites of prominent disc
   degeneration evident on radiographs, the proportion of abnormalities in
   surface smoothness, margin irregularity, and endplate thickening were
   all statistically significant in both younger and older animals (P <=
   0.0027). More severe changes were evident in the caudal versus cranial
   endplate surfaces. Histologic study of vascular tracer showed that there
   was no penetration of the disc by vascular supply from the endplate;
   this was verified by immunocytochemical identification of blood vessels.
   The canal system within the endplate was a complex 3D interconnected
   network.
   Conclusions. Findings show that disc degeneration in the sand rat occurs
   concomitantly with marked architectural bony changes on the endplate
   face, including loss of smoothness and development of irregular bony
   margins. Vascular connections were not present between the endplate and
   disc; this was verified with mu CT studies, in vivo vascular tracers,
   and traditional immunocytochemistry. The canal system within the imaged
   endplate was revealed to consist of a complex 3D interconnected network.}},

Abstract = {{A new description of Discohelix calculiformis DUNKER, 1847, the type
   species of Discohelix DUNKER, 1847, is given on the basis of the
   original material (syntypes). Moreover, new diagnoses are given for
   Discohelix and some other genera of the Discohelicidae (Pentagonodiscus
   WENDT, 1968, Colpomphalus COSSMANN, 1916, Asterohelix SZABO, 1984, and
   Zardinihelix BANDEL, 1988). The Discohelicidae are a heterogenic,
   probably polyphyletic unit. In the group
   Discohelix/Pentagonodiscus/Colpomphalus/Asterohelix (Discohelicidae
   sensu stricto) the growth lines run opisthocyrt on the lateral side
   (prosoclin on the dorsal and opisthoclin on the under side). Within the
   group Zardinihelix/Platybasis/Nummocalcar the growth lines run straight
   and prosoclin from the adapical to the abapical suture. These genera are
   only tentatively assigned to Discohelicidae. Discohelix parvanodosa
   GRONDEL, 2000 and related species have strongly strengthened growth
   lines on the first teleoconch whorls. This is typical of Liotiidae, and
   they probably belong to this family. Triadodiscus BANDEL, 1993 and
   possibly also Triadoskenea BANDEL, 1993 are synonyms of Eudaronia
   COTTON, 1945 (like Levihelix GRUNDEL, 2000) and belongs to Eudaroniinae
   GRUNDEL, 2004 (related to Skeneidae?). Valamidiscus SZABO, 2002 is
   possibly a member of the Discohelicidae but rather isolated within this
   family.}},

Abstract = {{Charge transport processes in disordered complex media are accompanied
   by anomalously slow relaxation for which usually a broad distribution of
   relaxation times is adopted. To account for those properties of the
   environment, a standard kinetic approach in description of the system is
   addressed either in the framework of continuous-time random walks
   (CTRWs) or fractional diffusion. In this paper the power of the CTRW
   approach is illustrated by use of the probabilistic formalism and limit
   theorems that allow one to rigorously predict the limiting distributions
   of the paths traversed by charges and to derive effective relaxation
   properties of the entire system of interest. In particular, the standard
   CTRW scenario is generalized to a new class of coupled memory CTRWs that
   effectivly can lead to the well known Havriliak-Negami response.
   Application of the method is discussed for nonexponential
   electron-transfer processes controlled by dynamics of the surrounding
   medium.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that cardiovascular
   disease in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is frequently
   related to damage of large conduit arteries. Arterial disease is
   responsible for the high incidence of ischaemic heart disease,
   peripheral artery diseases, left ventricular hypertrophy and congestive
   heart failure. The vascular complications in ESRD are ascribed to two
   different but associated mechanisms, namely atherosclerosis and
   arteriosclerosis. Whereas the former principally affects the conduit
   function with ischaemic lesions being the most characteristic
   consequence, the latter primarily disturbs the dampening function of
   large arteries. Arteriosclerosis in ESRD patients is characterized by
   diffuse dilation and wall hypertrophy of large conduit arteries and
   stiffening of arterial walls. These changes represent a clinical form of
   an accelerated ageing process. The main clinical characteristics due to
   arterial stiffening are isolated increase in systolic blood pressure
   with normal or lower diastolic pressure resulting in an increased pulse
   pressure. The consequences of these alterations are: (i) an increased
   left ventricular afterload with development of left ventricular
   hypertrophy and increased myocardial oxygen demand; and (ii) altered
   coronary perfusion and subendocardial blood flow distribution.
   Epidemiological studies have identified arterial remodelling and
   stiffening as independent predictors of overall and cardiac mortality in
   ESRD patients.}},

Abstract = {{1 Inhibition of the type 5 phosphodiesterase and inhibition of Rho
   kinase are both effective in reducing pulmonary hypertension (PH). Here
   we investigate whether Rho kinase inhibition is involved in the
   beneficial effect of the type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil
   on PH.
   2 Chronic hypoxia-induced PH in rats is associated with an increase in
   RhoA activity in pulmonary artery that was maximal after 2 days (10.7
   +/- 0.9-fold increase, n = 6, P < 0.001). The activity of Rho kinase
   assessed by measuring the level of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1
   (MYPT1) phosphorylation was also increased (5.7 +/- 0.8-fold over
   control, n = 8).
   3 Chronic fasudil (30 mg kg(-1)day(-1); 14 days) and sildenafil (25 mg
   kg(-1)day(-1); 14 days) treatments reduced PH and pulmonary
   cardiovascular remodelling, and inhibited the MYPT1 phosphorylation in
   pulmonary artery from hypoxic rats by 82.3 +/- 3\% (n = 4) and by 76.6
   +/- 2\% (n = 4), respectively.
   4 The inhibitory effect of sildenafil (10 mu m) on MYPT1 phosphorylation
   was demonstrated by the loss of actin stress fibres in vascular smooth
   muscle cells. However, in vitro kinase assays indicated that sildenafil
   had no direct inhibitory action on Rho kinase activity.
   5 Sildenafil treatment induced increased RhoA phosphorylation and
   association to its cytosolic inhibitory protein, guanine dissociation
   inhibitor (GDI) in pulmonary artery.
   6 We propose that sildenafil inhibits RhoA/Rho kinase-dependent
   functions in pulmonary artery through enhanced RhoA phosphorylation and
   cytosolic sequestration by GIN. The inhibition of intracellular events
   downstream of RhoA thus participates in the beneficial effect of
   sildenafil on PH.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate whether levels of Fas and
   Fas-ligand (Fas-L) expression in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell
   carcinomas (SCCs) are associated with tumor stage and grade, and to
   assess whether parameters related to argyrophilic nucleolar organizer
   regions (AgNORs) correlate with apoptosis in SCC cells and adjacent
   normal epithelium. Fifty-two specimens taken from the tumoral and
   neighboring normal tissues of 26 patients with oral and oropharyngeal
   SCC were analyzed for Fas/Fas-L expression, and 24 specimens from 12
   patients for AgNOR parameters. Seventeen (65\%) of the tumors were Fas
   and/or Fas-L-positive (by immunohistochemistry). A significant positive
   correlation was found between Fas/FasL expression and clinical tumor
   stage (P < 0.01). Mean AgNOR number per nucleus, AgNOR size and the
   percentage area of each nucleus occupied by AgNORs (percent of nuclear
   area) were significantly increased in the SCC cells (4.49 +/- 1.28, 4.48
   +/- 1.42, 5.56 +/- 1.22, respectively) when compared with the control
   neighboring squamous epithelial cells (2.58 +/- 0.61, 1.64 +/- 0.59 and
   4.35 +/- 0.62\%, respectively) (P < 0.01). A significant positive
   correlation was found between the AgNOR parameters and Fas/ Fas-L
   expression as apoptotic markers in the tumoral cells of SCC (P < 0.05).
   There was also a significant positive correlation between the AgNOR
   parameters and the grading of tumors (P < 0.05). In conclusion, AgNOR
   count was a strong proliferation marker in patients with SCC, and Fas
   and Fas-L staining was useful in tumor grading.}},

Abstract = {{Y-doped Al2O3 dielectric films have been fabricated by reactive radio
   frequency co-sputtering method. Grazing angle incidence x-ray

   microscope have been applied to observe the cross-section and the
   surface morphology of the thin films. The electric C-V and I-V
   characteristics were measured at high and variable frequency,
   respectively. It was found that the dielectric constant k of the films
   increases remarkably (from 8.14 to 11.8) with increasing Y-doping
   concentration. The Y-O bond is stronger than Al-O due to the obvious
   difference in electro-negativity between the two bond members, which
   enhanced the ionic polarization in the thin films leading to an increase
   of the dielectric constant. It was supposed that the presence of Y ions
   changed the structure and atomic coordination of Al2O3. The films were
   very smooth which meets the requirements of the device.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To estimate the direct and indirect arthritis-attributable
   costs to individuals with disabling hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (OA).
   Methods. An established population cohort with disabling hip and/or knee
   OA from two regions of Ontario, Canada was surveyed to determine
   participant and caregiver costs related to OA, and the predictors of
   these costs.
   Results. The response rate was 87.2\%. Of 1378 respondents, 1258 had OA
   (mean age 73.1 yr, range 59-100). Sixty per cent (n = 758) reported
   OA-related costs. Among these individuals, the average annual cost was
   \$12 200 (\$CDN in 2002, where \$1.00 CDN approximate to \$0.81 US).
   Time lost from employment and leisure by participants and their unpaid
   caregivers accounted for 80\% of the total. Men were less likely than
   women to report costs (adjusted odds ratio 0.54, P < 0.0001), but when
   they did their expenditures were significantly higher (P = 0.004).
   Greater disability was associated with higher costs: compared with
   individuals with WOMAC total scores < 15, those with scores >= 55 were
   15 times more likely to report costs, and their costs were 3 times
   greater (both P < 0.0001). Both the young (< 65 yr) and very old were
   more likely to incur costs (P < 0.0001), and when they did their costs
   were higher (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion. Costs incurred were mainly for time lost from employment and
   leisure, and for unpaid informal caregivers. Failure to value such
   indirect costs significantly underestimates the true burden of OA. Costs
   increased with worsening health status and greater OA severity. After
   adjustment, men were less likely to incur costs, possibly due to greater
   social resources.}},

Title = {{Combined tumor therapy by using radiofrequency ablation and 5-FU-laden
   polymer implants: Evaluation in rats and rabbits}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-laden polymer
   implants as an adjunct to radiofrequency (RF) ablation for tumor
   treatment.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: All animal studies were performed in compliance
   with the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and
   Use Committee guidelines. Three studies were performed to investigate
   (a) in vitro dissolution of 5-FU-laden polymer implants in saline and
   bovine serum, (b) tissue distribution of 5-FU and its metabolite,
   5-fluorouridine (5-FUrd), in the ablated liver tissue of rats (n = 4),
   and (c) efficacy of combined approach (n = 4) compared with that of
   ablation alone (n = 6) for VX2 liver tumor model in rabbits.
   Characterization of 5-FU release in vitro and distribution of 5-FU in
   rat liver tissue were analyzed by using high performance liquid
   chromatography; in vivo efficacy was assessed by using computed
   tomography and pathologic examination.
   RESULTS: Results of the in vitro dissolution study showed that a 75\%
   release of 5-FU occurred in 2 days when exposed to bovine serum and in 9
   days when exposed to phosphate-buffered saline. In the ablated rat
   liver, the 5-FU level was higher at the center and lower at the
   periphery of the tissue both at 24 hours (41.0 mg per kilogram tissue vs
   15.0 mg per kilogram tissue, respectively) and at 48 hours (8.0 mg per
   kilogram tissue vs 2.0 mg per kilogram tissue, respectively). The 5-FUrd
   concentration was twofold higher peripherally than centrally and was
   higher at 48 hours than at 24 hours. In rabbits, local delivery of 5-FU
   immediately after RF ablation provided a significant (P < .05) reduction
   in tumor size compared with ablation alone (1.80 cm(3) +/- 0.28
   {[}standard error] vs 3.53 cm(3) +/- 0.52, respectively; P =.034) and a
   more than 20-fold reduction in tumor size compared with the control
   (1.80 cm(3) +/- 0.28 vs 41.95 cm(3) +/- 11.58, respectively; P = .018).
   CONCLUSION: Combined treatment by using 5-FU polymer implants and RF
   ablation shows uniform sustained release of 5-FU for 48 hours at least 8
   mm from the edge of the ablation zone and appears to be successful at
   controlling the growth of an experimental tumor in rabbits appreciably
   better than does ablation alone. (c) RSNA, 2005.}},

Abstract = {{A new method, different from common eigenvalue extraction methods, was
   proposed by Li and Kikuchi (in 8th ARC conference, 2002). It consists of
   explicit finite-element method and eigenvalue-extraction method in time
   domain. Even though the new method performs well in extracting
   eigenvalues, it is difficult to identify global modeshape of the given
   structure due to large size of time history data. Only some eigenvectors
   of a few nodal points can be extracted. In this paper, we apply computer
   animation technique to identify the global modeshape from a few nodal
   eigenvectors. Free-form deformation (FFD) technique is simply
   modified-simple FFD-and applied to the identification of global
   modeshapes. The basic concepts that consist of simple FFD algorithm are
   Delaunay triangulation and barycentric coordinate. Some numerical
   examples show good performance for the identification of global
   modeshape of a given structure.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent molecular rotors belong to a group of twisted intramolecular
   charge transfer complexes (TICT) whose photophysical characteristics
   depend on their environment. In this study, the influence of solvent
   polarity and viscosity on several representative TICT compounds (three
   Coumarin derivatives, 4,4-dimethylaminobenzonitrile DMABN,
   9-(dicyanovinyl)-julolidine DCVJ), was examined. While solvent polarity
   caused a bathochromic shift of peak emission in all compounds, this
   shift was lowest in the case of molecular rotors. Peak intensity was
   influenced strongly by solvent viscosity in DMABN and the molecular
   rotors, but polarity and viscosity influences cannot be separated with
   DMABN. Coumarins, on the other hand, did not show viscosity sensitivity.
   This study shows the unique suitability of molecular rotors as
   fluorescent viscosity sensors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A high precision composite plate-bending element developed by Sheikh et
   al. has been applied to the free vibration analysis of isotropic and
   fibre-reinforced laminated composite folded plates. The in-plane
   displacements, transverse displacement and rotations of the normal have
   been taken as independent field variables and they have approximated
   with polynomials of different orders. Initially, the degrees of freedom
   of the element is 65, which is reduced to 54 by eliminating the degrees
   of freedom of the internal nodes through static condensation. To
   facilitate the condensation process, an efficient mass lumping scheme
   has been recommended to form the mass matrix having zero mass for the
   internal nodes. Recommendation has also been made for the inclusion of
   the rotary inertia in the mass matrix. Numerical examples of isotropic
   and composite one-, two-, and four-fold folded plates having different
   crank angles, fibre orientations, thickness ratios, number of layers and
   boundary conditions have been solved using the proposed element. The
   present results have been compared with those obtained from different
   sources. In all the cases the present element showed an excellent

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{259-283}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The revised simplex method is often the method of choice when solving
   large scale sparse linear programming problems, particularly when a
   family of closely-related problems is to be solved. Each iteration of
   the revised simplex method requires the solution of two linear systems
   and a matrix vector product. For a significant number of practical
   problems the result of one or more of these operations is usually
   sparse, a property we call hyper-sparsity. Analysis of the commonly-used
   techniques for implementing each step of the revised simplex method
   shows them to be inefficient when hyper-sparsity is present. Techniques
   to exploit hyper-sparsity are developed and their performance is
   compared with the standard techniques. For the subset of our test
   problems that exhibits hyper-sparsity, the average speedup in solution
   time is 5.2 when these techniques are used. For this problem set our
   implementation of the revised simplex method which exploits
   hyper-sparsity is shown to be competitive with the leading commercial
   solver and significantly faster than the leading public-domain solver.}},

Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{552}},
Pages = {{33-44}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Use of science in wetland management has increased considerably over the
   last 50 years but there is still scope for improving the transfer of
   research results into management. Issues that lead to less than optimal
   transfer include: (1) managers not accessing existing technical
   information adequately, (2) researchers addressing issues of peripheral
   importance to management rather than key information needs, (3) managers
   failing to identify significant information gaps and to resource
   appropriate research in a timely way, (4) scale of research and
   certainty of results being inappropriate for application to broad-scale
   situations by managers responsible for outcomes, and (5) funding bodies
   not fully recognizing that transfer of research results to management
   requires a development phase. Establishment of recovery catchments in
   the Western Australian wheatbelt, with the aim of maintaining regional
   biodiversity in the face of increasing dryland salinisation, is a
   program that relies on transferring research results into management.
   However, the multi-disciplinary nature of managing salinisation is a
   challenge for many catchment managers and formal management systems are
   probably an important adjunct to close knowledge of the catchment when
   making management decisions. An examination of management planning and
   actions in the Lake Warden Natural Diversity Recovery Catchment,
   south-west Western Australia, highlights the continuum between research
   and management, the importance of understanding the physical environment
   when managing biodiversity, and the fact that much wetland conservation
   relies on management action in terrestrial landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{A fully differential, Class-AB, log domain microbeamformer has been
   designed in a 60 GHz Si-Ge BiCMOS process. The demonstrated
   microbeamformer has four input channels and four delays, though the
   concept can easily be extended to any desirable configuration. The log
   domain, Class-AB architecture is perfect for medical ultrasound
   applications due to the fact that the received ultrasound signal has
   very low amplitude during the major part of the reception period. This
   leads to very low power consumption because of the Class-AB
   configuration. The delay-line in the microbeamformer is constructed
   using a cascade of low input impedance allpass filter cells. A simple
   implementation of the zero in the allpass filter helps to keep the
   overall power consumption low. The delay of each allpass filter cell is
   programmable through the adjustment of a tuning current. Due to the
   Class-AB architecture used, every source signal must be shaped by a
   signal preconditioning circuit before connected to the filter cells. A
   well-known preconditioning circuit has been modified to increase the
   dynamic range. The modification introduces noise cancellation as well as
   a method to increases the maximum signal swing. The dynamic range of one
   preconditioning cell is shown to increase 12.6 dB compared to the
   classic translinear circuit at a penalty of 15\% increase in the power
   consumption. Signal-to-noise ratio of one allpass filter cell is
   typically 56.5 dB, and the global dynamic range of the same cell is
   typically 63.8 dB at an average power consumption of 3.5 mW when 16
   input signals are connected to the filter. The power consumption at
   maximum signal amplitude for the microbeamformer having four input
   channels and four delays is 3.2 mW with a supply voltage of 2.5 V. In
   the intended application, the quiescent power consumption is a much
   better description of the average power consumption. This power
   consumption is 1.3 mW.}},

   administration and co-morbidities. Moreover, psychiatrists strongly take
   the patient's target symptoms and the assumed efficacy of certain
   compounds into account in their choice of medication. Conclusion:
   Psychiatrists' explanations for their antipsychotic drug choice seem for
   the most part reasonable and overlap substantially with drug-choice
   algorithms of clinical guidelines. However, psychiatrists additionally
   use indicators that-in their view-might predict treatment response. For
   these indicators, which are derived from personal experience, it is
   still unclear whether they are valid and simply have not yet been proven
   in clinical trials or whether they merely represent unfounded
   assumptions on the part of the doctors.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a novel methodology that permits assessment of
   regional vascular mechanical property alterations in the presence of
   atheroma in vivo employing a Yucatan miniswine model with induced
   lesions. Femoral arteries were imaged with intravascular ultrasound.
   Image data were segmented and, following three-dimensional
   reconstruction, underwent finite element and sensitivity analysis with
   optimization to identify regions with altered vascular mechanical
   properties. All regions were compared to histological analysis. In 12
   animals with 8 weeks of endothelial cell denudation and high cholesterol
   diet (induced atherosclerosis), the elastic modulus initially decreased
   with early lesion development and then increased with increasing
   fibrosis-(elastic modulusall values x 10(4) Pa-mean SEM) histologically
   normal (non-denuded control segment) elements 9.73 +/- 0.01, fatty
   elements 9.53 +/- 0.01, fibrofatty elements 9.41 +/- 0.03, and fibrous
   elements 9.68 +/- 0.02 (all p < 0.001 vs. normal elements). Wall
   thickness, however, increased with atheroma formation. These data
   demonstrate decreasing vascular material properties with early lesions,
   followed by an increase as lesions progress. This methodology permits
   determination of areas with early atheroma development, follow atheroma
   progression, and potentially evaluate interventions aimed at decreasing
   atheroma load and normalizing vascular material properties. (c) 2004

Abstract = {{Although the phlebotomine sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz \& Neiva,
   1912) (Diptera: Psychodidae) is generally accepted to be a species
   complex, it is unclear how many members there are, how they are related
   and which are the main vectors of leishmaniasis. The vectorial capacity
   of each sibling species is likely to differ, thus a means of identifying
   the most important vector species is of critical importance to the
   epidemiology and control of this debilitating disease in South and
   Central America. In Brazil four chemotypes have been distinguished by
   sex pheromone analysis. In this study the sex pheromone extracts of L.
   longipalpis from six regions of Brazil were analysed in detail. Samples
   included the sympatric 1-spot, 2-spot and intermediate spot morphotypes
   from Sobral, Ceara State. The results strongly suggest that members of
   the complex that produce different sex pheromones are reproductively
   isolated, thus strengthening the argument that the different chemotypes
   represent true sibling species. The study also found significant
   differences in morphology and the amounts of sex pheromone produced by
   members of each chemotype from different parts of Brazil, which suggests
   population substructuring that has not previously been recognized.
   Evidence of a fifth chemotype in Brazil is also presented.}},

   syndrome}},
Journal = {{EPILEPSIA}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{1860-1870}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose:gamma-Aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A)r) subunit beta
   3-deficient mice model Angelman syndrome by displaying impaired
   learning, abnormal EEG with interictal spikes and slowing, myoclonus,
   and convulsions. The beta 3-subunit deficiency causes a failure of
   intrathalamic reticular nucleus inhibition, leading to abnormally
   synchronized thalamocortical oscillations. We postulated that this
   pathophysiology underlies the abnormal cortical EEG and triggers
   interictal spikes and seizures, but extrathalamic regions also
   contribute to interictal spikes and seizures, so that the EEG slowing
   should reveal an absence-like response profile, whereas spikes and
   seizures have dual responsiveness to absence and partial-seizure drugs.
   Methods: Recording electrodes were implanted over the parietal cortices
   of wild-type, heterozygotes, and homozygous null mice. In each
   experiment, EEG was recorded for 45 min, either drug or vehicle
   administered, and EEG recorded for another 3 h. Each EEG was scored for
   slow-wave activity, interictal spikes, and seizures by a reader blinded
   to treatments.
   Results: Interictal spiking and percentage of time in EEG slowing in
   heterozygotes were increased by the proabsence drug baclofen
   (GABA(B)-receptor agonist), whereas CGP 35348 (GABA(B)-receptor
   antagonist) had the opposite effect. The antiabsence drug ethosuximide
   markedly suppressed EEG slowing and interictal spiking in heterozygote
   and null mice. Broad-spectrum clonazepam and valproate were more
   effective on interictal spiking than on EEG slowing, and fosphenytoin
   suppressed only interictal spiking.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that this model of Angelman syndrome,
   although not expressing typical absence seizures, is characterized by
   hypersynchronous thalamocortical oscillations that possess absence-like
   pharmacologic responsiveness and promote EEG slowing, interictal spikes,
   and convulsive seizures.}},

   dietary leguminous pulse Phaseolus aureus Roxb. (Vigna radiata L.) by
   means of acetic acid precipitation. salt fractionation, ion-exchange
   chromatography (DEAE-cellu lose) and affinity chromatography on
   trypsin-sepharose column. P aureus inhibitor is a bi-functional
   inhibitor since it exhibits inhibitory activity towards trypsin-like and
   alpha-chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases as well as against
   alpha-amylases. It is a helix-rich protein (Mr 13,600) containing
   approximately eight tyrosines, one tryptophan and two cystines.
   N-terminal sequence alignment reveals no homology to other proteinase
   inhibitors reported from Phoseolus sp. thereby confirming that it is a
   novel inhibitor. Inhibitory activity measurements show that the
   inhibitor is quite stable even at extremely high temperatures and is
   only slightly affected by pH changes. Circular dichroism (CD)
   conformational studies revealed some changes in its near- as well as
   far-ultraviolet spectrum at extremes of pH and temperature. Treatments
   with trypsin for varying time periods did not alter its proteolytic
   inhibitory activity but caused some reduction in its amylase inhibitory
   activity. (C) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization may increase the risk of extinction for some rare and
   endangered plant species, either by increasing the rate of random
   genetic drift affecting populations or by introgression-mediated genetic
   assimilation. The former may occur when hybrids are less fit than
   nonhybrids and backcrossing would be less likely to occur, the latter
   may occur when hybrids are as fit, or fitter, than parents, and
   backcrossing is fairly common. To assess the risk of extinction by
   hybridization one must assess whether hybridization is actually
   occurring, and, if so, whether the hybrids are sterile, or are
   backcrossing. We analyzed one population each of the rare Liatris
   oligocephala and L. cylindracea and seven field-identified hybrids for
   ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA markers, and morphological
   characteristics to make a preliminary determination of the potential for
   L. oligocephala extinction via hybridization. We found unequivocal
   evidence that the two species are hybridizing, but no unequivocal
   evidence of backcrossing.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have underlined the role of feather eating in the
   development of feather pecking in laying hens. We investigated self
   selection of feathers by laying hens, in response to different feed
   structure (pellet, mash) and feeding regime (ad libitum, restricted).
   Since both factors result in modification of feed intake patterns, crop
   size was scored. 72 adult laying hens each of a high (HFP) and a low
   feather pecking line (LFP) were used. They were assigned to a randomised
   factorial design in the test and control phase: Factor A line (HFP
   birds, UP birds), factor B feed structure (pellets, mash), factor C
   feeding regime (ad libitum, restricted) and factor D (21, 28 and 36
   weeks of age). 10 feathers were offered to the hens every morning in the
   test phase. The number of feathers eaten was counted three times a day.
   Crop size was scored by palpation at the same time in the test and
   control phase. Feed consumption and body weight were recorded. In the
   present experiment HFP birds showed significantly more feather eating.
   Contrary to our hypothesis neither pellet feeding nor restricted feeding
   increased feather eating. There was correspondence in all treatments in
   the increase of dilatation of crop size over the day. In the test phase
   crop size was significantly larger in HFP birds than in LFP birds in the
   evening. In conclusion, this study showed that genotype has an effect on
   feather eating and crop size.}},

Title = {{Radial meniscal tears: Significance, incidence, and MR appearance}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY}},

Volume = {{185}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of
   radial meniscal tears at arthroscopy and the ability of MRI to detect
   radial tears preoperatively. In addition, the ability of four radiologic
   signs to detect radial tears was assessed. Those signs are the truncated
   triangle, cleft, marching cleft, and ghost meniscus signs.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. Arthroscopy of the knee was performed by a single
   orthopedic surgeon on 196 consecutive patients. The surgeon noted each
   radial tear he encountered. The MR images that were obtained at our
   institution were reviewed, whereas those patients who were imaged
   elsewhere were excluded. The preoperative MRI reports were reviewed to
   assess the ability to prospectively identify radial meniscal tears. In
   addition, a retrospective analysis of the MRI studies was performed by
   two radiologists in which four radiologic signs were applied to detect
   radial tears.
   RESULTS. Twenty-nine patients (15\%) had radial tears at arthroscopy.
   Eighteen of the 29 patients had their imaging performed at our
   institution and were selected for review. There were 19 radial tears
   found at surgery. Seven (37\%) of the 19 tears were identified as radial
   prospectively. Retrospectively, using the four signs for radial tears,
   reviewers identified 17 (89\%) of 19 radial tears.
   CONCLUSION. A more accurate preoperative diagnosis may be rendered using
   the four described signs to detect radial tears, thus allowing
   informative preoperative counseling and consideration of new therapies
   that are available for radial meniscal repair.}},

Volume = {{179}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of extensive thermal-infrared observations of the
   C-type near-Earth Asteroid (1580) Betulia obtained in June 2002 with the
   3-m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
   Betulia is a highly unusual object for which earlier radiometric
   observations, interpreted on the basis of simple thermal models,
   indicated a surface of high thermal inertia. A high thermal inertia
   implies a lack of thermally insulating regolith. Radiometric
   observations of other asteroids of comparable size indicate that
   regolith is present in nearly all cases. Knowledge of the surface
   thermal properties of small near-Earth asteroids is crucial for
   meaningful calculations of the Yarkovsky effect, which is invoked to
   explain the delivery of collisional fragments from the main belt into
   near-Earth orbits, and apparently has a significant influence on the
   orbital evolution of potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids.
   Furthermore, apart from being an indicator of the presence of thermally
   insulating regolith on the surface of an asteroid, the thermal inertia
   determines the magnitude of the diurnal temperature variation and is
   therefore of great importance in the design of instrumentation for
   lander missions to small asteroids. In the case of Betulia our database
   is sufficiently broad to allow the use of more sophisticated thermal
   models than were available for earlier radiometric observations. The
   measured fluxes have been fitted with thermal-model emission continua to
   determine the asteroid's size and geometric albedo, p(v). Fits obtained
   with a new thermophysical model imply an effective diameter of 4.57 +/-
   0.46 km and an albedo of 0.077 +/- 0.015 and indicate a moderate surface
   thermal inertia of around 180 J m(-2) s(-0.5) K-1. It is difficult to
   reconcile our results with earlier work, which indicate a larger
   diameter for Betulia and a high-thermal-inertia surface of bare rock.

   Older adults performed more poorly than younger adults on tests of
   temporal memory, but there were no age differences in nonassociative

   contrast, a combination of associative and simple order memory, both of
   which were reduced in older adults, completely accounted for age-related

Abstract = {{Objective: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global public
   health problem. Approximately 2 billion people are infected worldwide
   and more than 350 million of these individuals are chronic carriers of
   HBV. Approximately 15-40\% of infected patients will develop cirrhosis,
   liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alpha I antitrypsin
   (AAT) deficiency is one of many factors that may be involved in
   abnormalities such as liver and lung disease, inflammatory joint
   diseases, and inflammatory eye diseases. In the present study, the role
   played by AAT in HBV infected individuals is analyzed.
   Methods: AAT phenotyping and trypsin inhibitory capacity (TIC)
   experiments were performed on 281 HBV infected patients who were
   referred to Tehran and Zahedan Hepatitis Center for a period of 3 years
   from June 2001 to September 2003. The same tests were performed on 257
   individuals who did not suffer from any systemic diseases (control
   group). The case group was subdivided into three groups: carrier
   (36.7\%), chronic (50.5\%), and cirrhotic (12.8\%).
   Results: The results showed that AAT phenotypes, MS, MZ, M(I)Z, and MIS,
   were significantly higher in the HBV group (p < 0.01). In addition,
   there was a significant difference in AAT phenotypes (MS, MZ, and MIZ)
   among inactive carriers and individuals in the chronic and cirrhotic
   group (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of moderate AAT (MS, MIS, and
   MV) and severely deficient (MZ and M(I)Z) phenotypes in Iranian HBV
   individuals. In addition, AAT deficiency might be a risk factor for
   infected HBV individuals progressing from the carrier stage to chronic
   and cirrhotic stages. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

   is an important design parameter that controls clock skew and power

   show that constraint of small transition time reduces clock skew under
   manufacturing and supply voltage variabilities, whereas there is an
   optimum constraint value for temperature gradient. Our experiments in a

Abstract = {{The vasoactive peptide urotensin-II (U-II) is best known for its ability
   to regulate peripheral vascular and cardiac contractile function in
   vivo, and recent in vitro studies have suggested a role for the peptide
   in the control of vascular remodeling by inducing smooth muscle
   proliferation and fibroblast-mediated collagen deposition. Therefore,
   U-II may play a role in the etiology of atherosclerosis. In the present
   study we sought to determine the expression of U-II in coronary arteries
   from patients with coronary atherosclerosis and from normal control
   subjects, using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In
   nomial coronary arteries, there was little expression of U-II in all
   types of cells. In contrast, in patients with coronary atherosclerosis,
   endothelial expression of U-II was significantly increased in all
   diseased segments (P< 0.05). Greater expression of U-II was noted in
   endothelial cells of lesions with subendothelial inflammation or
   fibrofatty lesion compared with that of endothelial cells underlined by
   dense fibrosis or minimal intimal thickening. Myointimal cells and foam
   cells also expressed U-II. In most diseased segments, medial smooth
   muscle cells exhibited moderate expression of U-II. These findings
   demonstrate upregulation of U-II in endothelial, myointimal and medial
   smooth muscle cells of atherosclerotic human coronary arteries, and
   suggest a possible role for U-II in the pathogenesis of coronary
   atherosclerosis. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have documented disproportionately low sexual and body
   esteem in women with high degrees of physical impairment. Moreover,
   other studies have begun to examine the problem of intimate partner and
   other forms of abuse in women with physical disabilities. In this
   article we examine the link between low sexual and body esteem and
   intimate partner abuse in women with physical disabilities based on
   findings obtained from an in-depth qualitative study. Findings indicate
   that women with high degrees of physical impairment are more likely to
   perceive themselves as sexually inadequate and unattractive than women
   with mild impairment. These negative perceptions, when combined with a
   strong desire to be partnered, increased women's vulnerability to
   getting into and staying in abusive relationships over time Major themes
   presented in the article include: societal devaluation, low sexual and
   body esteem, preference for non-disabled men, desire to be partnered,
   and relationship decision-making. We depict the relationships between
   each of these themes in a simple model to further aid the reader's

Abstract = {{Objectives. Highly active antiretroviral therapy has altered the course
   of HIV infection among children, but new antiretroviral agents are
   needed for treatment-experienced children with drug-resistant virus.
   Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) is a promising agent for use in
   pediatric salvage therapy, because of its tolerability, efficacy, and
   resistance profile. We designed this study to provide preliminary
   pediatric safety and dosing information on tenofovir DF, while also
   providing potentially efficacious salvage therapy for heavily
   treatment-experienced, HIV-infected children.
   Methods. Tenofovir DF, alone and in combination with optimized
   background antiretroviral regimens, was studied among 18 HIV-infected
   children (age range: 8.3-16.2 years) who had progressive disease with >=
   2 prior antiretroviral regimens, in a single-center, open-label trial.
   Tenofovir DF monotherapy for 6 days was followed by the addition of
   individualized antiretroviral regimens. Subjects were monitored with HIV
   RNA reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and
   routine laboratory studies; monitoring for bone toxicity included
   measurement of lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) with dual-energy
   x-ray absorptiometry. Subjects were monitored through 48 weeks.
   Results. Two subjects developed grade 3 elevated hepatic transaminase
   levels during monotherapy and were removed from the study. The remaining
   16 subjects had a median of 4 antiretroviral agents (range: 3-5 agents)
   added to tenofovir DF. HIV plasma RNA levels decreased from a median
   pretreatment level of 5.4 log(10) copies per mL (range: 4.1-5.9 log(10)
   copies per mL) to 4.21 log(10) copies per mL at week 48 (n = 15), with 6
   subjects having <400 copies per mL, including 4 with <50 copies per mL.
   The overall median increases in CD4(+) T cell counts were 58 cells per
   mm(3) (range: -64 to 589 cells per mm(3)) at week 24 and 0 cells per
   mm(3) ( range: - 274 to 768 cells per mm(3)) at week 48. The CD4(+) cell
   responses among the virologic responders were high and sustained. The
   major toxicity attributed to tenofovir DF was a >6\% decrease in BMD for
   5 of 15 subjects evaluated at week 48, necessitating the discontinuation
   of tenofovir DF therapy for 2; all 5 subjects experienced >2 log(10)
   copies per mL decreases in HIV plasma RNA levels.
   Conclusions. Tenofovir DF-containing, individualized, highly active
   antiretroviral therapy regimens were well tolerated and effective among
   heavily treatmentexperienced, HIV-infected children. Loss of BMD may
   limit tenofovir DF use among prepubertal patients.}},

Abstract = {{The multi-species ecological system with cyclic dominance and vacant
   sites is studied. The theme is the forming problem of species' defensive
   alliances in the corresponding systems. Gyorgy Szabo and Gustavo Arial
   Sznaider have discussed the forming problem of species' defensive
   alliance in Phys. Rev. E 69, 031911 (2004). Now, this problem is
   discussed in depth. The following conclusions are obtained: Firstly, the
   necessary and sufficient condition of forming defensive alliances is
   that the number of species is even. Secondly, in the condition where the
   number of species is an even number, for any density of vacant sites,
   there is three forms of defensive alliance as follow:
   Deadlock - the habitats of specie's individuals in each alliance
   interweave together.
   Relative preponderance - the different of the number of species'
   individuals between the two defensive alliances keeps steadily.
   Absolute preponderance - the different of the number of species'
   individuals between the two defensive alliances enlarges continuously.
   This paper discusses the relations between the number of species and the
   forming of the defensive alliances, and shows the corresponding three
   statistical distributions of discrete density of vacant sites when there
   are four species.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a
   soluble monomeric form of the EphB4 extracellular domain (sEphB4) on
   choroidal endothelial cell (CEC) migration and tube formation and on
   experimental laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV).
   METHODS. EphrinB2 and EphB4 expression in CECs was investigated by
   Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Effects of sEphB4 ( 0.5
   - 3 mu g/mL) on CEC migration were evaluated with a modified Boyden
   chamber assay. Tube formation was assayed in CEC cultures in collagen
   gel. CNV was induced in rats by laser photocoagulation. The effects of
   intravitreal injection of sEphB4 on CNV development were evaluated at
   day 14 by fluorescein angiography ( FA), confocal volumetric analysis of
   isolectin-B4 labeled flatmounts, and histologic examination of CNV
   membranes.
   RESULTS. CEC cells express both EphB4 and EphrinB2, according to Western
   blot analysis. Immunohistochemical sections of rat eye showed
   immunoreactivity for both EphB4 and EphrinB2 in the choroidal
   endothelium. sEphB4 reduced CEC migration in response to vascular
   endothelial growth factor ( P < 0.01). Similarly, sEphB4 inhibited CEC
   tube formation in a dose-dependent manner. EphB4, and to a lesser extent
   EphrinB2, were detected on vascular channels within laser-induced CNV
   membranes. Intravitreal injection of sEphB4 inhibited laser-induced CNV
   formation. CNV membranes showed a reduction in leakage score ( P <
   0.05), and membrane volumes were reduced in size ( P < 0.05). Histologic
   analysis revealed that vascularity was reduced in sEphB4-treated
   membranes.
   CONCLUSIONS. Recombinant soluble monomeric EphB4 exerts an inhibitory
   effect on choroidal angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. It should be
   further evaluated for its potential as a novel therapy for CNV.}},

Abstract = {{Five experiments examined how 333 British participants used
   representations of the category ``EU countries,{''} to judge
   similarities, reason about generalization, and explain differences
   between EU countries. EU countries vary in their prototypicality and the

   affects preferences for statements about similarity between countries
   (Experiment 2). However, when generalizing a policy study between
   countries, category norms that included the policy's home country were
   formed, rendering that country's distinctive attributes implicit.
   Consequently participants generalized less to their distinctive in-group
   than from it, considered their in-group and the out-groups to be more
   similar when the policy's home country was their in-group rather than an
   out-group (Experiments 3a and 3b), and rarely mentioned attributes of
   the policy's home country while explaining differences between countries

Title = {{Disparate associations of a functional promoter polymorphism in PCK1
   with carotid wall ultrasound traits}},
Journal = {{STROKE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2566-2570}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose - Cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
   (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.32), encoded by PCK1, catalyzes the first committed
   step in gluconeogenesis. We previously showed that a -232C > G promoter
   polymorphism within a cis-acting element required for basal and
   cAMP-mediated PCK1 gene transcription results in loss of negative
   regulation by insulin, contributing to worsened metabolic control in the
   context of insulin resistance. We hypothesized that this polymorphism
   would be associated with carotid atherosclerosis in a sample of 150
   aboriginal Canadians.
   Methods - Dependent variables were 2 distinct carotid traits, namely
   intima-media thickness (IMT) assessed using B-mode ultrasound and total
   carotid plaque volume (TPV) assessed using 3D ultrasound.
   Results - Multivariate analysis showed significant but opposite
   associations of PCK1 genotype with these traits. Specifically, subjects
   with the PCK1-232G/G genotype had more carotid IMT (0.80 +/- 0.02 versus
   0.73 +/- 0.03 mm; P = 0.007) but less TPV (0.10 +/- 0.09 versus 0.38 +/-
   0.13; P = 0.03) than subjects with other genotypes.
   Conclusions - The findings connect the key enzyme in gluconeogenesis
   with atherosclerosis. The meaning of the opposing associations of PCK1
   genotype with IMT and TPV is unclear; more work is required to confirm
   whether these might be distinct quantitative traits with different
   biological determinants.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to systematically investigate how high
   doses of sparsely and densely ionizing radiations influence the
   proliferation time of lymphocytes in short-term cultures and,
   consequently, the observed frequencies of dicentric and centric ring
   chromosomes. Peripheral blood samples from five volunteers were
   irradiated with high doses of 200 kV X-rays and with neutrons with a
   mean energy of < E (n)>=2.1 MeV. First division metaphase cells were
   collected after different culture times of 48, 56, and 72 h and
   dicentrics, centric ring chromosomes, and acentric fragments were
   determined. The data hint at considerable mitotic delay. The main
   increase in the number of chromosome aberrations occurred between 48 and
   72 h after an X-ray exposure and between 56 and 72 h after neutron
   exposure. When the data were used for a calibration of aberration
   frequency versus dose, subsequent dose estimations resulted, however, in
   comparable values. Thus, in spite of the influence of mitotic delay on
   observable chromosome aberrations, at least for the radiation types
   investigated here, a culture time of 48 h is acceptable for biological
   dosimetry.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress and inflammatory processes accelerate the formation of
   advanced glycation end products (AGE), e.g. of pentosidine. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the relationships between levels of
   pentosidine in serum and synovial fluid, proinflammatory cytokines,
   other markers of inflammatory activity, and the state of radiologically
   visible bone destruction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). One
   hundred thirty-three nondiabetic RA patients and 56 age-matched, healthy
   subjects were included. Serum and synovial fluid pentosidine,
   erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and
   rheumatoid factor levels were determined. In 30 patients, the
   proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha
   and the soluble receptors sIL-2R, sIL-6R, sTNF-alpha, and RI/RII were
   also measured. Serum levels of pentosidine were on average significantly
   higher in RA patients than in healthy subjects and correlated
   significantly to ESR, CRP, and serum levels of IL-6. Serum and synovial
   fluid pentosidine did not show any differences. Rheumatoid
   factor-positive RA patients had higher pentosidine levels in the
   synovial fluid than rheumatoid factor-negative patients. Correlations
   could not be found between pentosidine and the other cytokines or
   cytokine receptors measured. The binding of AGE on cell receptors
   induces activation of nuclear factor kappa B, resulting in enhanced
   synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, AGE generation may
   also lead to the formation of new, immunologically relevant epitopes at
   synovial proteins. Both mechanisms could contribute to initiation and
   perpetuation of the inflammatory and destructive processes in RA.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective: An anti-inflammatory effect of

   is a key enzyme in the production of precursors of inflammatory lipid
   mediators. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of
   clonidine on phospholipase A(2) activity in an established in vitro
   model. Methods: Human being platelet membranes containing active
   phospholipase A(2) were exposed to buffer control or to three increasing
   concentrations of clonidine. Phospholipase A(2) Was measured by a
   radioisotope technique. Results: A massive increase in phospholipase
   A(2) activity was measured after clonidine exposure leading to final
   values of 92.5 +/- 3.1 pmol mg protein-(1) min(-1) (4.5-fold higher than
   control values; P <= 0.01 vs. control). After clonidine exposure the
   maximal reaction velocity increased, while the Michaelis-Menten constant
   did not change. The Lineweaver-Burk representation suggested an
   interaction of clonidine with the phospholipase A(2)-substrate complex
   as well as the phospholipase A(2) molecule. Conclusion: We conclude that
   the putative anti-inflammatory effect of clonidine was not caused by
   inhibition of phospholipase A(2).}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews overpressure (OP) processing of Ag-sheathed (Bi,
   Pb)(2)Sr2Ca2Cu3Ox (2223) flat wire. OP processing is a variant of hot
   isostatic pressing that densifies the 2223 filaments, which increases
   the critical current density J(c) of the wire. OP processing is done at
   pressures up to 300 bar with a mixed Ar/O-2 atmosphere in which the
   oxygen partial pressure is set so the 22,23 phase is stable. The Ar
   pressure compresses the wire. The highest reported J(c) in OP-processed
   short wires is 69.6 kA cm(-2) (self-field (SF), 77 K) and 30.8 kA cm(-2)
   (0.1 T, 77 K). I-c as high as 100 A has been achieved in 1.5 km lengths
   of OP wire.}},

Abstract = {{Molybdenum-based alloys with the addition of small amounts of silicon (2
   to 4.5 wt pct) and boron (similar to 1 wt pct) can form a passivating
   layer that protect's the alloy from further rapid oxidation. When such
   molybdenum-based alloys are exposed to oxidizing environments at high
   temperatures, a borosilicate glass layer can form that will reduce the
   transport of Oxygen to the alloy to limit further oxidation. Oxidation
   is then controlled by diffusion through the borosilicate glass layer.The
   focus of this research was to study the development of the borosilicate
   layer on a Mo-3Si-1B (wt pct) alloy. The oxidation of this alloy was
   studied,in a variety of gas environments over a range of temperatures in
   order to elucidate the critical factors that allow it to develop a
   protective borosilicate glass layer. The borosilicate glass layer is
   protective when no continuous channels exist in the layer extending from
   the gas interface to the alloy interface. The borosilicate layer is
   believed to contain channels in the early stages of development and the
   elimination of the channels is obtained by appropriate control of the
   temperature and gas-flow conditions, whereby MoO3 is removed via
   vaporization while the borosilicate viscosity is not increased due to
   loss of B2O3. Once the borosilicate layer is continuous and free of
   channels, subsequent oxidation occurs by inward diffusion of oxygen and
   outward diffusion of molybdenum through this layer, with vaporization Of
   MoO3 occurring at the gas/borosilicate-layer interface and MoO2 and
   additional borosilicate forming at the alloy/MoO2 interface.}},

Abstract = {{EPAS1 is a gene involved in complex oxygen sensing. It is expressed in
   microvascular endothelial cells, lung epithelial cells, cardiac myocytes
   and the brain. An association study was undertaken comparing elite
   endurance athletes classified into two groups according to a power-time
   model of performance intensity: power-time-maximum (PT-MAX; N=242, event
   duration 50 s to 10 min) and power-time-steady state (PT-SS; N= 151,
   event duration similar to 2-10 h), with normal controls (N = 444) using
   12 SNPs across EPAS1. Ordinal regression analysis of allele frequencies
   revealed significant differences at SNPs 2 and 3 (P=0.01). Haplotype
   analysis revealed the presence of haplotypes involving SNPs 2-5 that
   significantly differentiated (P < 0.05) the groups based on an ordinal
   ranking using the power-time classification. These same haplotypes
   differentiated the PT-MAX group in which a significant decrease in a
   haplotype (F: G-C-C-G; OR=0.57, P=0.02, 95\% CI 0.36-0.92) and increase
   in a second haplotype (G: A-T-G-G; OR= 1.75, P=0.03, 95\% CI 1.05-2.91)
   was observed compared to controls. The PT- SS group was differentiated
   from the PT-MAX group by a third haplotype (H: A-T-G-A; OR=0.46, P=0.04,
   95\% CI 0.22-0.96). Since EPASI has a role as a sensor capable of
   integrating cardiovascular function, energetic demand, muscle activity
   and oxygen availability into physiological adaptation, we propose that
   DNA variants in EPAS1 influence the relative contribution of aerobic and
   anaerobic metabolism and hence the maximum sustainable metabolic power
   for a given event duration.}},

   2. The molar masses of the grafted side chains M-w,M-br range from 6.8 x
   10(3) g/mol to 5.8 x 10(4) g/mol, which are well below and above the

   number (p) over bar of side chains per molecule ranges from 0.6 to 6.7.
   The oscillatory measurements follow the time temperature superposition
   principle. The shift factors do not depend on the number of branches.
   The zero-shear viscosities of all graft PS are lower than those of
   linear PS with the same molar mass, which can be attributed to the
   smaller coil size of the branched molecules. It is shown that the
   influence of branching on the frequency dependence of the dynamic moduli
   is weak for all graft PS that were investigated, which can be explained
   by the low entanglement density.}},

Abstract = {{The reptiles of Mt Nlonako, a mountain at the southeastern edge of the
   Cameroon mountain range ({''}Dorsale camerounaise{''}), were inventoried
   continually over a six year period from 1998 to 2004. This area
   encompasses 150 km(2) of lowland, submontane and montane rainforest with
   an elevation up to 1,825 m. Accounts of 89 species are provided based on
   collected and photo-documented material. This inventory proved Mt
   Nlonako to be the most species rich single-locality area in reptilian
   fauna in Africa. With 63 snake species Mt Nlonako exhibits the greatest
   number of species in Africa and possibly worldwide. Analysis showed the
   reptilian species composition to be most similar within Cameroon with
   that of Korup National Park followed by the Dja Faunal Reserve in the
   south. Relative to the snake composition the Korup NP and the Dimonika
   region in Congo-Brazzaville show the highest resemblance. In an African
   context the reptile fauna of Mt Nlonako is characterized by species
   which occur in both West and Central Africa as opposed to the mountain's
   amphibian species which more closely resemble Central African fauna. The
   high species richness and endemicity is discussed from a paleoclimatic
   perspective. Conservation status and threats to the reptiles are noted.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The quality of analytical results is expressed by their uncertainty, as
   it is estimated on the basis of an uncertainty budget; little effort is,
   however, often spent on ascertaining the quality of the uncertainty
   budget. The uncertainty budget is based on circumstantial or historical
   data, and therefore it is essential that the applicability of the
   overall uncertainty budget to actual measurement results be verified on
   the basis of current experimental data. This should be carried out by
   replicate analysis of samples taken in accordance with the definition of
   the measurand, but representing the full range of matrices and
   concentrations for which the budget is assumed to be valid. In this way
   the assumptions made in the uncertainty budget can be experimentally
   verified, both as regards sources of variability that are assumed
   negligible, and dominant uncertainty components. Agreement between
   observed and expected variability is tested by means of the T-test,
   which follows a chi-square distribution with a number of degrees of
   freedom determined by the number of replicates. Significant deviations
   between predicted and observed variability may be caused by a variety of
   effects, and examples will be presented; both underestimation and
   overestimation may occur, each leading to correcting the influence of
   uncertainty components according to their influence on the variability
   of experimental results. Some uncertainty components can be verified
   only with a very small number of degrees of freedom, because their
   influence requires samples taken at long intervals, e.g., the
   acquisition of a new calibrant. It is therefore recommended to include
   verification of the uncertainty budget in the continuous QA/QC
   monitoring; this will eventually lead to a test also for such rarely
   occurring effects.}},

Pages = {{111-124}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus in the North sea increased their
   distributional range when more abundant, but this density dependent
   habitat selection (DDHS) explained only a small part of the year-on-year
   variation in distribution patterns. The condition of haddock was
   examined at 24 sites in the North Sea in August and September 2004 and
   related to their abundance, to examine if the ideal free distribution
   theory (IFD), which assumes that organisms select habitats that maximize
   their rate of food intake, can be used to explain this variation in
   large scale distribution patterns. At a given temperature, condition
   (hepato-somatic index, I-H) was better at stations where haddock were
   most abundant. Therefore, haddock were not distributed perfectly
   according to the IFD in 2004. The positive correlation between abundance
   and I-H, however, indicated there was some habitat selection by haddock,
   as in the total absence of habitat selection no correlation between I-H
   and abundance, and no spatial variation in abundance was expected. DDHS
   may only explain a small part of the yearly variation in the
   distribution because haddock did not equalize and maximize their fitness
   at the scale of the North Sea. In addition, stable isotope analysis of
   muscle samples showed that haddock did not avoid competition for food
   when at high abundance by feeding at a lower or wider range of trophic
   levels. (c) 2005 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.}},

   nursery-grown European beech (Fagus sylvatica) seedlings displaying
   symptoms of cotyledon rot. Koch's postulates were verified and mode of
   infection of the associated isolates was investigated with light and
   scanning electron microscopy. Population structure of the pathogen was
   investigated by scoring the anastomosis reaction type in pairings
   between different isolates from the same seedbed. One pathogen genotype
   showed a large distribution area within the seedbed, this implying that
   the inoculum had been building up in the seedbed over a longer time
   period. Hyphal anastomosis tests and sequence analysis of the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA indicated that the
   pathogen belongs to AG 2-1 of R. solani. ITS sequence analysis indicates
   that the isolates from beech are closely related to R. solani isolates
   causing a disease on tulip. The striking similarities between the two
   diseases are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify indications for and
   complications of abdominal or vaginal surgical removal of the cervical
   stump after previous supracervical hysterectomy.
   Study design: This was a retrospective chart review of trachelectomy
   patients at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, or Mayo Clinic,
   Scottsdale, Arizona, between January 1974 and December 2003.
   Results: Of 335 patients with a history of supracervical hysterectomy
   who subsequently required trachelectomy, 25 were excluded from study.
   Half of the remaining 310 patients had trachelectomy between 1974 and
   1983, an average of 26 years after hysterectomy. The indication in three
   quarters of trachelectomies performed vaginally was prolapse. The
   vaginal approach had significantly fewer complications than the
   abdominal approach.
   Conclusion: Removal of the cervical stump is infrequent and has declined
   over a 30-year period. The decline in trachelectomy may be because of a
   decreasing number of supracervical hysterectomies performed. When
   trachelectomy is performed vaginally, prolapse is the most common
   indication, and there are few complications. (c) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a decentralized motion control algorithm of
   multiple mobile manipulators for handling a single object in cooperation
   with a human. In the proposed control algorithm, the,grasping point of
   the mobile manipulator is controlled as if it has a caster-like dynamics
   referred to as virtual 3-D caster, and each mobile manipulator could
   handle the object based on an intentional force/moment applied by a
   human. In addition, the coordinated motion control algorithm between the
   manipulator and the mobile base for each mobile manipulator is designed.
   By using these motion control algorithms, the coordination among
   multiple mobile manipulators is realized without using the geometric
   relations among robots. The proposed control algorithms are
   experimentally applied to two mobile manipulators and experimental
   results illustrate the validity of the proposed control algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{We report the discovery of an unbound hyper-velocity star, US 708, in
   the Milky Way halo, with a heliocentric radial velocity of + 708 +/- 15
   km s(-1). A quantitative NLTE model atmosphere analysis of optical
   spectra obtained with. LRIS at the Keck I telescope shows that US 708 is
   an extremely helium-rich (N-He/H-H/ = 10) subluminous O type star with
   T-eff = 44 500 K, log g = 5. 23 at a distance of 19 kpc. Its Galactic
   rest frame velocity is at least 751 kms kms(-1), much higher than the
   local Galactic escape velocity indicating that the star is unbound to
   the Galaxy., It has been suggested that such hyper-velocity stars can be
   formed by the tidal disruption of a binary through interaction with the
   supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic centre (GC). Numerical
   kinematical experiments are carried out to reconstruct the path from the
   massive GC. US 708 needs about 32 Myrs to travel from the GC to its
   present position, less than its evolutionary lifetime Its predicted
   proper motion e. mu(alpha) cos delta = -2.3 mas yr(-1) and mu(delta) = -
   2. 4mas yr(-1) should be measurable by future space missions. We
   conjecture that US 708 is formed by the merger of two helium white
   dwarfs in a close binary induced by the interaction with the SMBH in the
   GC and then escaped.}},

Abstract = {{Ordering of batches of printed circuit boards (PCBs) has a significant
   impact on the efficiency of the electronic component placement

   set of groups with minimal cardinality. This paper considers three
   variants of the job grouping problem under a single formulation. A
   generic mathematical formulation which solves all three of them is
   given. The variants are abstractions of machine organizations used in
   present day manufacturing systems. Inspired by the new formulation of
   the exact solution method a joint heuristics suited for all the three
   problems is also constructed. Benefits of the new algorithm are its
   conceptual simplicity, its adaptability to different machine layouts and

Abstract = {{In this study, cells isolated from hen medullary bone were cultured to
   examine their matrix formation. Furthermore, we compared medullary bone
   cells with rat bone marrow cells regarding the temporal changes in
   osteoblast developmental markers. Medullary bone cells were positive for
   alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and formed bone nodules, apparent
   with Alcian blue and von Kossa staining. The intensity of these stains
   became stronger with the maturation of those bone nodules. In this
   developmental process, the expression patterns of osteoblast phenotypes
   of medullary bone cells differed from those of rat bone marrow cells.
   ALP mRNA was expressed at the maximum level in the proliferation stage
   and gradually decreased in medullary bone cells, but that expression
   showed the opposite pattern in rat bone marrow cells. Medullary bone
   cells strongly expressed two non-collagenous protein mRNAs from the
   early stages, but the expression of these mRNAs in rat bone marrow cells
   increased only in the later stages. These results suggest that the
   features of medullary bone osteoblasts differ from those of mammalian
   osteoblasts and are reflected in the characteristics of medullary bone
   in vivo. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   (SLR) and long latency stretch reflex (LLR) response i.e.
   electromyographic (EMG) onset latencies and EMG amplitudes in erector
   spinae (ES). Nine males with muscle soreness (DOMS group) were tested
   24, 48 h, and 7 days post-exercise. Eight males (control group) were
   tested likewise. EMG was measured from ES bilaterally at the level of
   L3/L4. The SLR was elicited by mechanically tapping the ES at L3/L4, and
   the LLR was elicited by sudden loadings of the spine. Significant
   reductions in force during maximal voluntary contractions and range of
   motion, and a significant increase in muscle soreness (measured by
   pressure algometry) and subjective experience of soreness in the low
   back indicated DOMS 24, and 48 h post-exercise in the DOMS group. No
   changes were observed in the control group. The SLR and LLR response
   were unaffected by DOMS, i.e. no changes in EMG latencies and amplitudes
   were observed. In conclusion, despite changes in DOMS indicators, the
   reflex system protecting the stability of the lumbar spine is apparently
   capable of maintaining an appropriate triggering of SLR and LLR.}},

Abstract = {{The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, is a serious pest in
   Midwestern soybean, Glycine max L. Merrill, and has the potential to
   colonize a large geographic range throughout a single growing season,
   Our objectives were to describe colonization patterns on a statewide
   spatial and temporal scale, examine the changing proportion of winged
   forms throughout a season, and assess photoperiod as a potential trigger
   for alate production. In Minnesota, we define initial colonization as
   the period of time during the early vegetative growth when alates were
   present and alatoid nymphs were absent on soybean. Initial colonization
   during 2002 and 2003 was similar to 2 wk. On average across Minnesota,
   summer migrants were first produced when most fields were at the initial
   flowering stages in 2002. In 2003, an outbreak year, initial detection
   of summer migrants occurred earlier during vegetative stages before
   flowering. The significant increase in the proportion of all potential
   migratory forms (i.e., alatoid nymphs and adults) occurred during the
   beginning of seed set for both years. During seed set, the mean
   proportion of alate A. glycines was 0.15 +/- 0.04 (SE) in 2002 and 0.16
   +/- 0.06 in 2003. The mean proportion of alatoid nymph A. glycines was
   0.14 +/- 0.04 in 2002 and 0.29 +/- 0.04 in 2003 during seed set. The
   total mean proportion of migratory fort-as was higher when the critical
   L:D photoperiod was 14.5:9.5 b/d. A regression analysis also indicated
   the proportion of winged A. glycines increased with decreasing
   photoperiod.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of hypoxic cells in an in vivo tissue engineering
   chamber was investigated up to 28 days post-implantation.
   Methods: Arteriovenous loops were constructed and placed into bi-valved
   polycarbonate chambers containing 2 X 10(6) rat fibroblasts in basement
   membrane gel (BM gel). Chambers were inserted subcutaneously in the
   groin of mate rats and harvested at 3 (n = 6), 7 (n = 6), 14 (n=4) or 28
   (n=4) days. Ninety minutes before harvest, pimonidazole (60 mg/kg) was
   injected intraperitoneally. Chamber tissue was removed, immersion fixed,
   paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained immunohistochemically using
   hypoxyprobe-1 Mab that detects reduced pimonidazole adducts forming in
   cells, where pO(2). < 10 mmHg.
   Results: At 3 days a fibrin clot/BM gel framework fitted the chamber.
   Seeded fibroblasts had largely died. The majority of 3 day chambers did
   not demonstrate tissue growth from the AV loop nor was pimonidazole
   binding present in these chambers. In one chamber in which tissue growth
   had occurred strong pimonidazole binding was evident within the new
   tissue. In four out of six 7 day chambers a broader proliferative zone
   existed extending up to 0.4 mm (approximately) from the AV loop
   endothelium which demonstrated intense pimonidazole binding. The two
   remaining 7 day chambers displayed even greater tissue growth (leading
   edge > 0.7 mm from the AV loop endothelium), but very weak or no
   pimonidazole binding. At 14 and 28 days the fibrin/BM get matrix was
   replaced by mature vascularised connective tissue that did not bind
   pimonidazole.
   Conclusion: Employing a tissue engineering chamber, new tissue growth
   extending up to 0.4mm from the AV loop endothelium (chambers <= 7 days)
   demonstrated intense pimonidazole binding and, therefore, hypoxia.
   Tissue growth greater than 0.5 mm from the AV loop endothelium (7-28
   days chambers) did not exhibit pimonidazole binding due to a significant
   increase in the number of new blood vessels and was, therefore,
   adequately oxygenated. (c) 2005 The British Association of Plastic

Abstract = {{Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is a candidate for use as optical and
   insulating material in a nuclear reactor and/or fusion reactor. In the
   present study, in situ observations by an electron microscope was
   performed during helium and xenon ion irradiations of YSZ single
   crystals. Damage evolution in the YSZ crystals was observed during
   irradiation with 35 keV He+ with a flux of 5 x 10(13) ions/cm(2) s at
   1073 K, 1273 K and 1473 K. The damage evolution was also observed with
   60 keV Xe2+ with a flux of 5 x 10(12) ions/cm(2) s at 1073 K and 1473 K.
   In these cases, bubble formation was clearly observed. Dislocation loops
   were formed by Xe ion irradiation at both temperatures but were not
   formed by He. This result shows clear dependence of loop formation on
   the ion species. Dependence of the loop formation on irradiation
   temperature was also shown in comparison with previous experimental
   results. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Set-shifting difficulties have been reported in subjects with
   anorexia nervosa and appear to persist after recovery; therefore, they
   may be endophenotypic traits. The goals of this study were to
   investigate whether set-shifting difficulties are familial by examining
   discordant sister-pairs in comparison with healthy unrelated women and
   to replicate, with a broader battery, the lack of influence of an acute
   illness state on neuropsychological performance.
   Method: Forty-seven pairs of sisters discordant for anorexia nervosa and
   47 healthy unrelated women who were comparable in age and IQ completed
   neuropsychological tasks selected to assess set-shifting ability.
   Analyses of variance with standard errors that are robust against
   correlations within family clusters were used to compare the groups.
   Results were adjusted for obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, and depression
   symptoms. Subjects with acute (N=24) and fully remitted (N=23) anorexia
   nervosa were compared to assess state versus trait effects.
   Results: Sisters with and without anorexia nervosa took significantly
   longer than unrelated healthy women to shift their cognitive set (CatBat
   task) and demonstrated greater perceptual rigidity (Haptic Illusion
   task) but did not differ significantly from each other. Women with
   anorexia nervosa were slower than other groups on Trail Making tasks.
   Women who had fully recovered from anorexia nervosa made significantly
   fewer errors than those with acute anorexia nervosa on the Trail Making
   alphabet task, but these subgroups did not differ on other measures.
   Conclusions: Both affected and unaffected sisters had more set-shifting
   difficulties than unrelated healthy women. This finding, together with
   the replicated finding that set-shifting difficulties persist after
   recovery, suggests that set-shifting difficulties are trait
   characteristics and may inform the search for the endophenotype in
   anorexia nervosa.}},

Abstract = {{The chemopreventive agent sulforaphane is an isothiocyanate derived from
   cruciferous vegetables. Sulforaphane exerts cancer chemopreventive
   effects by inducing antioxidant/electrophile response element
   (ARE)-regulated phase 2 enzyme and antioxidant genes through activation
   of the transcription factor nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2),
   which is regulated by the thiol-rich sensor protein Kelch-like
   ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Sulforaphane is an electrophile that
   can react with protein thiols to form thionoacyl adducts. We
   hypothesized that, like other electrophilic Nrf2 activators,
   sulforaphane activates this system through specific modifications of the
   Keap1 protein. However, thionoacyl adducts are labile to hydrolysis and
   transacylation reactions, which complicate the identification of the
   sulforaphane adduct sites on Keap1. In this study, we characterized the
   stability of sulforaphane thionoacyl adducts and developed a liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to map labile
   sulforaphane adduct sites formed on Keap1 in vitro. Sulforaphane
   displays a distinctly different pattern of Keap1 modification than
   previously studied ARE inducers that modify Keap1 by alkylation.
   Sulforaphane modified Keap1 most readily in the Kelch domain, rather
   than in the central linker domain, which is targeted by previously
   characterized ARE inducers. Also, in contrast to previously studied ARE
   inducers and as reported recently {[}Zhang, et al. (2005) J. Biol. Chem.
   280, 30091-30099], sulforaphane treatment in vivo does not lead to the
   accumulation of ubiquitinated Keap1. Our observations suggest a novel
   mechanism for Nrf2 stabilization by sulforaphane-Keap1 thionoacyl adduct
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) is beneficial
   for patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) when added to medical
   treatment. However, its role as an alternative to conventional
   mechanical ventilation (CMV) remains controversial. Our aim was to
   compare the efficacy and resource consumption of NIMV against CMV in
   patients with ARF.
   Design: A randomized, multicenter, controlled trial. Setting: Seven
   multipurpose ICUs. Patients: Sixty-four patients with ARF from various
   causes who fulfilled criteria for mechanical ventilation.
   Intervention: The noninvasive group received ventilation through a face
   mask in pressure-support mode plus positive end-expiratory pressure; the
   conventional group received ventilation through a tracheal tube.
   Measurements and results: Avoidance of intubation, mortality, and
   consumption of resources were the outcome variables. Thirty-one patients
   were assigned to the noninvasive group, and 33 were assigned to the
   conventional group. In the noninvasive group, 58\% patients were
   intubated, vs 100\% in the conventional group (relative risk reduction,
   43\%; p < 0.001). Stratification by type of ARF gave similar results. In
   the ICU, death occurred in 23\% and 39\% (p = 0.09) and complications
   occurred in 52\% and 70\% (p = 0.07) in the noninvasive and conventional
   groups, respectively. There were no differences in length of stay. The
   Therapeutic Intervention Score System-28, but not the direct nursing
   activity time, was lower in the noninvasive group during the first 3
   days.
   Conclusions: NIMV reduces the need for intubation and therapeutic
   intervention in patients with ARF from different causes. There is a
   nonsignificant trend of reduction in ICUs and hospital mortality
   together with fewer complications during ICU stay.}},

Abstract = {{Upscaling methods that need to solve local problems subject to boundary

   Using optimal control techniques, we obtain an effective computing

   the well-known results. The uniqueness issue is tackled for the
   optimization problems introduced in our approach. We show that the

   establishes a link with homogenization theory, and finally, 2D numerical

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{D23}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The oxidation of dissolved SO2 (as S(IV)) by dissolved O-3 is known to
   increase rapidly with pH and is generally thought to be the mechanism
   responsible for the oxidation of S(IV) in sea-salt aerosol at high pH.
   Recently, Hoppel et al. (2001) have shown that an aerobic reaction
   studied by Zhang and Millero (1991) increases even more rapidly with pH
   than O-3 oxidation and exceeds that of O-3 at pH of about 7.5 to 8.5,
   depending on the ambient SO2 concentrations. At high pH, both of these
   oxidation mechanisms proceed so rapidly that the actual rate is
   constrained by both gas-phase and aqueous-phase transport processes. A
   method of analysis is developed to calculate the transport-limited
   reaction rates for both of these mechanisms in sea-salt aerosol. Even
   when the unconstrained O-3-S(IV) rate is faster than the aerobic
   mechanism, aqueous-phase transport limitations on ozone can slow the
   constrained O-3-S(IV) rate to the degree that it is slower than the
   aerobic reaction. In general, the O-3-S(IV) rate is favored over the
   aerobic mechanism at low SO2 and high O-3 concentrations, whereas the
   aerobic mechanism is favored at high SO2 concentrations. The analysis
   indicates that the O-3-S(IV) mechanism is more important in the remote
   regions where the SO2 concentration can be extremely low. When the SO2
   concentration approaches 1 ppb or greater the aerobic mechanism is
   likely to be more important.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. Early correction is regarded as the treatment of choice for
   patients with tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonary atresia with ventricular
   septal defect. Nevertheless, some of these patients reach adulthood
   without early correction. This study sought to assess risk factors for
   operative mortality and determine the benefit of total correction in
   adolescent and adult patients.
   Methods. A retrospective analysis of 52 patients (> 16 years at the time
   of corrective surgery) for tetralogy of Fallot (n = 42) or pulmonary
   atresia with ventricular septal defect (n = 10) between 1974 and 2003
   was performed.
   Results. Age at correction was 28.9 +/- 9.9 (16 to 57 years). There were
   8 early deaths (15.4\%). Preoperative hemoglobin concentration (p =
   0.002) and reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract with a
   patch (p = 0.002) were correlated with a significantly higher early
   mortality. Mean follow-up time was 12.3 +/- 10.4 years. Late deaths (n =
   6; 11.5\%) were cardiac-related in 2 of 6 cases. At follow-up, 28
   patients (87.5\%) were assigned to the New York Heart Association
   functional class I. Twenty-four patients led a normal life with
   full-time work, 6 patients were able to do part-time work, and only 2
   patients experienced noticeable limitation on activities.
   Conclusions. Repair of tetralogy of Fallot and of pulmonary atresia with
   ventricular septal defect in this patient group is associated with a
   high early mortality. Preoperative chronic cyanosis, expressed by
   elevated hemoglobin concentration, is predictive for early mortality.
   Because cyanosis has been shown to lead to multiorgan dysfunction, we
   conclude that preoperative multiorgan dysfunction may be the intrinsic
   risk factor for perioperative mortality. Surgical correction in this
   patient group should still be recommended because the functional status
   considerably improves.}},

Abstract = {{We apply a model that accommodates dynamic phenomena in demand- and

   well as to consequences of actions. We estimate a fixed effects VARX
   model with dynamic and interactive effects for multiple brands based on
   pooled time series and cross-sectional data for two product categories.
   The Impulse Response Analysis (IRA) results for one category (tuna)
   under different scenarios show that the inclusion/exclusion of
   competitive reaction-and feedback effects matters a lot, consistent with
   a high degree of competitive interaction in this market. We find that
   the role of cross-brand feedback effects is greater than the role of
   traditional competitive reaction effects. Intrafirm effects (internal
   decisions) also play an important role. In a decomposition study we show
   that the exclusion of these effects may either increase (up to 12\%) or
   decrease (by as much as 50\%) the net unit sales effect of a 20\% price
   reduction. By contrast, in the second category (shampoo), where brands
   have distinct positions, the exclusion of these effects matters very
   little. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   characterize the directions of 2 intersecting fibers using a 2 fiber

   over-fitting a 1 fiber model, are explored. This new algorithm enhances

Abstract = {{Background: Thrombin is a primary inducer of thrombus formation by
   activations of coagulation cascade and platelet aggregation. Hitherto,
   several types of thrombin inhibitors have been developed for therapeutic
   purpose. Objectives: We prepared modified thrombin (M-thrombin) and
   modified anhydrothrombin (M-anhydrothrombin) by chemical modification of
   carboxyl groups of thrombin and anhydrothrombin, respectively, to
   present a new strategy for a potent antiplatelet-anticoagulant agent and
   new tools for investigation of thrombin functions. Results:
   M-anhydrothrombin retained high affinity for factor VIII (FVIII), but
   demonstrated lower affinity than anhydrothrombin for fibrinogen and
   factor V (FV). Both M-anhydrothrombin and anhydrothrombin prolonged
   activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) without affecting
   prothrombin time, and M-anhydrothrombin prolonged APTT much more than
   anhydrothrombin. M-anhydrothrombin also retained affinity for the
   recombinant extracellular domain peptide of protease-activated receptor
   1 (PAR1). M-thrombin exhibited marginal clotting activity (4\% of
   thrombin), but induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma
   without forming a fibrin clot, which was completely suppressed by
   anti-PAR1 antibody (ATAP2) and by M-anhydrothrombin, but not by
   anhydrothrombin. These results indicate that M-thrombin induced platelet
   aggregation through the activation of PAR1, and M-anhydrothrombin
   inhibited this process completely. In contrast, neither
   M-anhydrothrombin nor anhydrothrombin apparently inhibited
   thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Only in the presence of the
   Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro (GPRP) peptide that inhibits polymerization of fibrin,
   M-anhydrothrombin completely inhibited thrombin-induced platelet
   aggregation. Conclusion: M-thrombin is PAR1-specific and
   M-anhydrothrombin is FVIII- and PAR1-specific derivatives, and thereby,
   are new tools as specific agonist and antagonist, respectively, of PAR1.
   Furthermore, M-anhydrothrombin may be an attractive model for
   development of a potent anticoagulant-antiplatelet agent.}},

   dual-enzyme kinetic model which is nonlinear, transient, and zero-order.
   Existing transport models are not designed to simulate such reaction
   kinetics. The objective of this paper is to present a Petrov-Galerkin
   finite element model (PGFEM) to simulate transport and bioreduction of
   Cr(VI), by MR-1, in groundwater. The model developed is unconditionally
   stable and provides oscillation free accurate results for a wide range
   of Peclet number (Pn) and Courant number (Cn).}},

Abstract = {{Surface phase behavior of n-hexadecyl phosphate (n-HDP) and its mixture
   with L-arginine (L-arg), which behaves as L-argininium cation (L-arg(+))
   in aqueous solution, at a molar ratio 2:3 in Gibbs adsorption layers has
   been studied by film balance, Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) and
   surface tensiometry at <= 20 degrees C. The monolayers of n-HDP show
   three phases that are gas (G), intermediate (1) and liquid condensed
   (LC) and two phase transitions. A first-order G-I phase transition that
   is followed by a second-order I-LC phase transition is found in these
   monolayers. Although the monolayers of the mixtures containing n-HDP and
   L-arg show three phases, the nature of the middle phase is different
   from that of the n-HDP monolayers. The three phases observed for the
   mixed systems are G, liquid expanded (LE) and LC phases. A first-order
   G-LE phase transition is found at a low surface pressure at >= 10
   degrees C. This transition is followed by another first-order LE-LC
   phase transition at a certain higher surface pressure. The first-order
   nature of the phase transitions for both the systems is confirmed by the
   presence of plateaus in the pi-t curves, which are accompanied by two
   surface phases. A second-order phase transition in the monolayers of
   n-HDP is indicated by a gradual change in the surface morphology, from a
   uniformly bright isotropic to an anisotropic mosaic textured phase,
   which is accompanied by a continuous change in the surface pressure. The
   domains formed during the first-order phase transition in the adsorption
   layers of n-HDP are circular and remain unaffected by changing the
   temperature. Although the domains of an LE phase are circular, those of
   an LC phase at the latter transition are fractal in the mixed system. A
   further branching of the arms of the fractal domains is found to occur
   by an increase in the temperature. All the results are explained by
   considering salt formation between anion from n-HDP and L-arg(+). (c)

Abstract = {{Scholars have long debated the relative influence of domestic and

   This presumption, we demonstrate, does not hold up to empirical

   connection between the partisan composition of Congress and the
   quarterly frequency of major uses of force between 1945 and 2000; we do
   not find any congressional influence, however, on minor uses of force.
   We recommend that the quantitative use-of-force literature in
   international relations begin to take seriously theories of domestic
   political institutions, partisanship, and interbranch relations that
   have been developed within American politics.}},

Abstract = {{Monthly total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chlorophyll
   concentrations, Secchi depth, and lake water level data for 84 Florida
   lakes were used to examine relations between trophic state variables and
   water level fluctuation. Lake size averaged 566 ha (range 4.0 to 5609
   ha), with the period of record for individual lakes averaging 57 months
   (range 7 to 175 months). Lake level fluctuation for individual lakes
   averaged 1.3 m (range 0.1 to 3.5 m). The lakes also ranged from
   oligotrophic to hypereutrophic, with average chlorophyll values for
   individual lakes ranging from 1 to 97 mu g center dot L-1. No overall
   relation between trophic state variables and lake level fluctuation
   could be found among the population of lakes. However, individual lakes
   showed direct, inverse, or no significant relations between lake trophic
   state variables and water level fluctuation, regardless of the magnitude
   of water level fluctuation. These data suggest that predicting how water
   level fluctuations will impact trophic state variables among a
   population of lakes will be difficult, if not impossible, and that any
   accurate predictions will have to be made after first examining several
   mechanisms within individual lake systems.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to identify design features for action games that would
   appeal to game-buyers, rather than game-players. Sixteen frequent-buyers
   of computer games identified 39 design features that appeal to buyers by
   contrasting different versions of Pacman games. Twenty-eight versions of
   Pacman were then evaluated in terms of the identified design features by
   45 participants ( 27 male and 18 female college students). Qnet2000
   neural network software was used to determine the relative importance of
   these design features. The results indicated that the top 10 most
   important design features could account for more than 50\% of
   ``perceived fun{''} among these 39 design features. The feature of
   avatar is important to game-buyers, yet not revealed in previous
   player-oriented studies. Moreover, six design factors underlying the 39
   features were identified through factor analysis. These factors included
   ``novelty and powerfulness,{''} ``appealing presentation,{''}
   ``interactivity,{''} ``challenging,{''} ``sense of control,{''} and ``
   rewarding,{''} and could account for 54\% of total variance. Among these
   six factors, appealing presentation has not been emphasized by
   player-oriented research. Implications of the findings were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay was developed to detect and
   quantify human parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3). Two sets of primer-probe
   pairs were designed based on the nucleotide (nt) sequence of the
   nucleocapsid (N) gene. The primer-probe pairs were derived from the 3'
   end of the N gene (set 1) and the 5' region of the gene (set 2),
   respectively. Using real-time RT-PCR, the sensitivity of set I was
   determined to be about 9 copies of PIV3 genome, while the sensitivity of
   set 2 was about 93 copies of PIV3 genome. Set I was chosen for
   subsequent experiments. This primer-probe pair detected PIV3, but not
   any of several other respiratory viruses, indicating that the assay is
   PIV3 specific. For clinical evaluation, the assay was employed to test
   80 nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with respiratory symptoms. The
   results confirmed the presence of PIV3 in 12 specimens previously
   identified as positive by culture confirmation, and showed all of which
   contained more than 100 copies of PIV3 genome. In addition, the method
   also detected PIV3 genomes in specimens found negative by culture
   confirmation, indicating the value of this RT-PCR assay. These data thus
   demonstrate the application of the real-time RT-PCR assay for the
   detection and quantification of PIV3 in clinical specimens. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The effects of the mixed herbal preparation ``Tzuo-Kuai-Wuan{''} (TKW)
   on bone metabolism were compared with a single herb containing
   equivalent amounts of isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and a
   combined estrogen-progesterone therapy (EPT). One hundred women
   completed the trial, 33 in group A, consuming a single herb, 30 in group
   B, consuming TKW, and 37 in group C, receiving EPT. In both herbal
   groups, the serum levels of daidzein significantly increased after
   treatment for 6 months (224\% in group A and 234\% in group B, both p <
   0.01), though the serum levels of genistein did not change
   significantly. In group C, serum levels of either isoflavone changed
   only slightly. After 6 months of treatment, the bone formation marker
   (bone specific alkaline phosphatase {[}BSAP]) significantly increased in
   group B, but not in group A (25.4\% vs. 15.9\%, p < 0.01 and p = 0.09,
   respectively). The elevation of BSAP was related to increased serum
   daidzein and genistein (beta = 0.498 and 0.248, p < 0.01 and p = 0.03,
   respectively). The bone resorption marker (urinary
   deoxypyridinolines/creatinine {[}Dpd/Cr]) was nearly the same at
   beginning of the study and after treatment in both herbal groups. In
   contrast, BSAP and Dpd/Cr significantly decreased after 3 and 6 months
   of treatment in group C (BSAP: 10.4\% and 30.3\%; Dpd/Cr: 21.7\% and
   43.8\%, all p < 0.01 in paired t-tests). Thus, we conclude that TKW
   stimulates bone formation, in contrast to EPT which primarily inhibits
   resorption. This effect appears to be related to the amount of
   isoflavones. Further, the stronger effect in women consuming TKW than
   consuming a single herb that contains equivalent amounts of isoflavones
   suggests higher synergistic or additive effect of other components than
   isoflavones in TKW.}},

Abstract = {{An orthorhombic polycrystal is an orthorhombic aggregate of tiny
   crystallites. In this paper, we study the effect of the crystalline mean
   shape on the constitutive relation of the orthorhombic polycrystal. The
   crystalline mean shape and the crystalline orientation arrangement are
   described by the crystalline shape function (CSF) and the orientation
   distribution function (ODF), respectively. The CSF and the ODF are
   expanded as an infinite series in terms of the Wigner D-functions. The
   expanded coefficients of the CSF and the ODF are called the shape
   coefficients s(m0)(l) and the texture coefficients C-mm(l) I
   respectively. Assuming that C-eff in the constitutive relation depends
   on the shape coefficients s(m0)(l) and the texture coefficients c(mm)(l)
   by the principle of material frame-indifference we derive an analytical
   expression for C-eff up to terms linear in si, and cl and the expression
   would be applicable to the polycrystal whose texture is weak and whose
   crystalline mean shape has weak anisotropy. C-eff contains six
   unspecified material constants (lambda, mu, c, s(1), s(2), s(3)), five
   shape coefficients (s(00)(2), s(20)(2), s(00)(4), s(20)(4), s(40)(4)),
   and three texture coefficients (c(00)(4), c(20)(4), c(40)(4)). The
   results based on the perturbation approach are used to determine the
   five material constants approximately. We also find that the shape
   coefficients s(m0)(2) and s(m0)(4) are all zero if the crystalline mean
   shape is a cuboid. Some examples are given to compare our computational
   results.}},

Abstract = {{In animals, the tetraspanins are a large superfamily of membrane
   proteins that play important roles in organizing various cell-cell and
   matrix-cell interactions and signal pathways based on such interactions.
   However, their origin and evolution largely remain elusive and most of
   the family's members are functionally unknown or less known due to
   difficulties of study, such as functional redundancy. In this study, we
   rebuilt the family's phylogeny with sequences retrieved from online
   databases and our cDNA library of amphioxus. We reveal that, in addition
   to in metazoans, various tetraspanins are extensively expressed in
   protozoan amoebae, fungi, and plants. We also discuss the structural
   evolution of tetraspanin's major extracellular domain and the relation
   between tetraspanin's duplication and functional redundancy. Finally, we
   elucidate the coevolution of tetraspanins and eukaryotes and suggest
   that tetraspanins play important roles in the unicell-to-multicell
   transition. In short, the study of tetraspanin in a phylogenetic context
   helps us understand the evolution of intercellular interactions. (c)

Abstract = {{This paper addresses methods for determining the motion of an
   elastically suspended rigid body in frictional contact at multiple
   distinct locations. The methods developed assume that: (1) The motion of
   the support from which the body is suspended and the elastic behavior of
   the suspension are known; (2) inertial forces are negligible (motion is
   quasi-static); and (3) the contact is characterized by Coulomb friction.
   The derived coupled set of spatial rigid body equations is used to
   determine both the unknown direction of the friction force (at each
   point of contact) and the unknown motion of the rigid body. The
   uniqueness of the set of active constraints when considering multipoint
   contact is also addressed. We show that, for any passive compliant
   system, if the coefficient of friction at each contact is upper bounded,
   the set of active constraints is unique. A procedure to determine both
   the set of active constraints and the motion of the constrained body is
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel method to analyze the thermal image of a
   printed circuit board (PCB) for fault detection. In this method, a gold
   thermal image is first generated from the thermal images of the PCB in
   normal operation, and then compressed into a codebook with a certain
   number of codewords. Each codeword represents a block of image size four
   by four. Each block in the thermal image for the board under test (BUT)
   is then encoded in the same way. The codewords in the codebook are
   arranged in ascending order with respect to their mean values. Any
   abnormal functional block in BUT can be identified by comparing the
   codeword index with that of the corresponding block in the gold thermal
   image. The memory size for storing the templates for comparison is,
   thus, significantly reduced without diagnosis performance degradation.
   Also, there is not a necessity for feature extraction such as the
   feature-based diagnostic methods. In addition, an adaptive threshold
   criterion is proposed to improve the detection sensitivity. From the
   experimental results, this proposed method is demonstrated to be very
   effective in abnormal functional block identification for PCBs based on
   the thermal image. Furthermore, this method is highly modularized for
   hardware implementation and parallel realization to speed up the
   processing time.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase that is
   produced by a genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has been
   approved for prophylaxis and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome in 2001.
   In several studies, rasburicase, given at a dose of 0.15-0.2 mg/kg for
   up to 7 d, proved to be highly effective in lowering urate levels. Case
   report: We report the case of a patient with chronic lymphatic leukemia
   (CLL) who experienced tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with acute renal
   failure after fludarabine/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and after
   bendamustine treatment. During the first episode of TLS, after
   fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (creatinine 3.3 mg/dL, urate 24.6 mg/dL),
   the patient received rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg for 3 d. Urate levels
   decreased below the lower limit of normal and renal function recovered.
   After bendamustine therapy, given for disease progression 8 months
   later, TLS with acute oliguric renal failure re-occurred (creatinine 3.1
   mg/dL, urate 20.8 mg/dL). The patient was treated with hyperhydration
   and two doses of rasburicase (0.056 mg/kg), resulting in a prompt
   decrease of the urate level and recovery of renal function. Both
   episodes of TLS were successfully treated with rasburicase in a lower
   dose than recommended by the manufacturer. During a second bendamustine
   course, TLS was successfully treated by low doses of rasburicase (0.056
   mg/kg for 2 d). Conclusion: This is the first report of TLS in CLL after
   bendamustine chemotherapy reported in the literature. Treatment and
   prevention of TLS by low doses of rasburicase is possible and
   cost-effective.}},

Journal = {{CHINA QUARTERLY}},

Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{914-933}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The establishment of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, which opened
   its doors in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on I July 1961, the 40th
   anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, was a
   complicated political and cultural decision on the part of the Chinese
   government. The museum was never intended to be an artistic enterprise.
   Rather, it was conceived as a political institution to serve the
   interest of the Party. This article argues that the Party was ubiquitous
   in the building of the museum, exercising tight control through strict
   institutional means, especially through its Propaganda Department.
   Museum staff, under the close supervision of senior Party officials,
   sought to pursue an indigenous path different from the Soviet model.
   Staff members collected artifacts related to the Chinese Communist
   Revolution, commissioned historical paintings, arranged displays
   according to the historical framework stipulated by Mao Zedong, and,
   most important, struggled to instil in the museum the correct ``Red
   Line,{''} that is, the policy of the CCP under Mao's leadership. The
   article concludes that the museum was an intricate amalgam of political
   supervision from the top, official historical interpretations, strategic
   displays and a reflection of the internal Party struggle. The
   construction of the museum reflects the attempt by the CCP to control
   the collective memory of the nation and to monopolize the writing of
   history.}},

Abstract = {{In 2004, the Department of Health published 10 High Impact Changes
   across the NHS. Of these, the first was treating day surgery as the norm
   for elective operations, releasing up to half a million in-patient beds
   each year. Adenoidectomy is an operation commonly performed in children
   for upper respiratory tract obstruction and as part of the surgical
   management of otitis media with effusion. Many surgeons consider the
   traditional curettage adenoidectomy as an unsatisfactory operation
   because it is performed blind, and is associated with varying reported
   levels of postoperative bleeding. Concern about the risk of bleeding and
   the frequent occurrence of post-operative nausea and vomiting have
   discouraged many surgeons from adopting adenoidectomy as a day-case
   procedure. We have audited the management and discharge of a cohort of
   72 children undergoing traditional curettage adenoidectomy. Based on the
   results, we have completed the audit loop, by managing a second cohort
   of 77 children by suction coagulation adenoidectomy. An anaesthetic
   protocol has been designed to reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting,
   and facilitate same day discharge from hospital. The rate of
   post-operative nausea and vomiting felt from 21 to 1.3\%, and the
   post-operative bleeding from 9.7\% to nit. Discharge on the day of
   operation rose from 40.3 to 100\%. Our audit confirms that these
   measures permit safe, day-case adenoidectomy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the significance of cricoid
   cartilage palpability as a selection criterion for bedside tracheostomy
   and to prospectively compare a cohort of patients undergoing bedside
   tracheostomy with another cohort receiving operating room tracheostomy.
   STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective trial comparing 2 cohorts of patients
   receiving tracheostomies at a tertiary care center (university
   hospital). In all, 220 consecutive intubated patients selected for
   elective tracheostomy were enrolled. Of them.. 134 patients had palpable
   cricoid cartilage and underwent open surgical tracheostomy at the
   bedside. The remaining 68 patients received open surgical tracheostomies
   in the operating room. Demographic data, patient anatomic features, and
   perioperative complications were prospectively recorded. There were no
   statistically significant differences in age, gender, reason for
   admission, indication for tracheostomy, Acute Physiology and Chronic
   Health Evaluation 11 score, number of days intubated, or time required
   to perform the procedure for those patients whose tracheostomies were
   performed in the operating room versus the intensive care unit.
   RESULTS: Patients with a palpable cricoid cartilage had a significantly
   reduced perioperative complication rate compared with those without a
   palpable cricoid cartilage (2\% vs 22\%, P < 0.001). Comparison of
   cervical girth, mental-to-sternum distance, and thyroid-notch-to-sternum
   distance showed no significant difference between the 2 groups and did
   not further define selection criteria.
   CONCLUSION: This investigation prospectively confirms the safety of
   bedside tracheostomy placement in properly selected patients.
   Complication incidences are defined for open surgical tracheostomy at
   the bedside and in the operating room. Palpability of the cricoid
   cartilage has significant value as a selection criterion for bedside
   tracheostomy.
   SIGNIFICANCE: These findings will aid in the development of protocols
   and pathways for surgical airway management in critically ill patients
   to maximize cost-effective, high-quality care.}},

Title = {{Can electronic routine data act as a surrogate for patient-assessed

Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{138-143}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: There has been a rapid growth in the use of patient-assessed
   outcomes (PAOs) that are measured in the assessment of health
   technologies. The process of collection of such measures can be costly,
   and there may be problems associated with the ability of the patient to
   complete them. The use of electronically stored routine data may reduce
   costs and overcome the problems associated with patient completion. The
   feasibility of using routine data surrogates for the UK Inflammatory
   Bowel Disease Questionnaire (UKIBDQ) and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) was
   examined.
   Methods: Clinical terms and codes for the UKIBDQ and SF-36 questions
   were identified, and data from electronic routine sources were sought on
   patients participating in a randomized controlled trial. The presence or
   absence of relevant symptoms was used to generate surrogate scores,
   which were compared with the original scores.
   Results: Most questions in the UKIBDQ and SF-36 were codable but only
   one third of the terms were recorded routinely in electronic form. The
   surrogate total IBDQ score had reasonable reliability (Kuder-Richardson
   coefficient = 0.51), but this reliability could not be determined for
   the SF-36. Intraclass correlations between routine and designed data
   were poor to weak.
   Conclusions: Although electronic routine data sources had the capacity
   to develop surrogate measures for patient assessed outcomes, there was
   evidence of wide underutilization of coding systems leading to an
   underreporting of symptoms. This finding is consistent with previous
   literature where only poor correlations were illustrated between patient
   assessed outcomes and surrogate scoring of symptoms.}},

   record HP-LT metamorphism in the LVU, followed by progressive
   decompression leading to final greenschist facies re-equilibration
   during dominantly extensional deformation. Final tectonic emplacement of
   the LVU over the PCU post-dated the metamorphism of the LVU and was
   accompanied by intense ductile deformation along zones of strain
   localisation in footwall rocks. All of the units were later affected by
   folding and minor thrusting during subsequent Apennine tectonics.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional natural-convection heat transfer to air from multiple
   identical protruding heat sources, which simulate electronic components,

   source temperatures, channel dimensions, openings, boundary conditions,
   and source locations on the heat transfer from and flow above the
   protruding sources are investigated, and the onset of instability is
   studied. The results indicate that the channel dimensions and the
   presence of openings have significant effects on the fluid flow.
   However, their effects on heat transfer are found to be relatively
   small. The increase in channel height is seen to lead to a less stable
   flow and, consequently, a decrease in the critical Grashof number.
   Numerical simulation of the flow at the openings is investigated and
   found to be crucial to an accurate modeling of the transport.}},

Abstract = {{The effects on soybean yield components of inoculation with arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungus ( AMF) Glomus fasciculatum were investigated at
   different phosphorus levels. The level of root AMF colonization
   decreased a little when P levels increased. Mycorrhizal inoculation and
   increasing levels of P application had positive effects on yield
   components such as stem and root length, shoot and root dry weight, stem
   diameter, 1000-grain weight and seed yield per plant but not on legume
   numbers per plant. Both mycorrhiza inoculation and P treatments affected
   P and N concentrations of grain and roots of soybean. Mycorrhizal fungi
   decreased the need of P addition in growth medium by contributing to the
   demand of optimum phosphorus for growth of soybean.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Microvascular alterations in the diabetic and hypertensive
   heart are likely to contribute to heart failure. In this work,
   myocardial blood flow and left ventricular function were measured in
   vivo in diabetic, hypertensive, and diabetic-hypertensive rats using MRI
   methods.
   Methods: An 8-week-duration type 1 diabetes was induced by
   streptozotocin (STZ) in 8 Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (STZ) and in 11
   spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats (STZ-SHR). Fourteen WKY and 12 SHR
   served as control and hypertensive groups. Myocardial blood flow
   quantification was performed using an arterial spin-labeling MRI method.
   Left ventricular morphology and function were assessed during the same
   experiment using cine-MRI.
   Results: Respective myocardial blood flow values for each group were 6.4
   +/- 1.1 (WKY), 6.0 +/- 1.9 (STZ), 5.5 +/- 1.3 (SHR), and 4.3 +/- 0.9
   mL.g(-1).min(-1) (STZ-SHR). Myocardial blood flow was significantly
   decreased in STZ-SHR rats compared with the other groups (p < .05,
   STZ-SHR vs. all groups). Cine-MRI showed morphological alterations in
   all pathological groups. No alteration of the ejection fraction was
   observed in the pathological groups.
   Conclusion: Myocardial blood flow is altered in vivo before any sign of
   heart failure when rats have type 1 diabetes and hypertension
   simultaneously. When only one of the pathologies occurs, MBF does not
   vary significantly.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive thermal scaling analysis of
   multilevel interconnects in deep nanometer scale CMOS technologies based
   on technological, structural, and material data from the International
   Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. Numerical simulations have been
   performed using three-dimensional electrothermal finite element methods,
   combined with accurate calculations of temperature- and size-dependent
   Cu resistivity and thermal conductivity of low-kappa interlayer
   dielectrics (ILD) based on fully physical models. The simulations also
   incorporate various scaling factors from fundamental material level to
   system level: the via-density-dependent effective ILD thermal
   conductivity, the hierarchically varying root mean square current stress
   based on SPICE simulations, and the thermal resistance of flip-chip
   package. It is shown that even after considering densely embedded vias,
   the interconnect temperature is expected to increase significantly with
   scaling, due to increasing current density, increasing surface and grain
   boundary contributions to metal resistivity, and decreasing ILD thermal
   conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{As a means to study the function of plasma membrane proteins during cold
   acclimation, we have isolated a cDNA clone for wpi6 which encodes a
   putative plasma membrane protein from cold-acclimated winter wheat. The
   wpi6 gene encodes a putative 5.9 kDa polypeptide with two predicted
   membrane-spanning domains, the sequence of which shows high sequence
   similarity with BLT101-family proteins from plants and yeast. Strong
   induction of wpi6 mRNA was observed during an early stage of cold
   acclimation in root and shoot tissues of both winter and spring wheat
   cultivars. In contrast to blt101 in barley, wpi6 mRNA was also induced
   by drought and salinity stresses, and exogenous application of ABA.
   Expression of wpi6 in a Delta pmp3 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
   which is disturbed in plasma membrane potential due to the lack of a
   BLT101-family protein, partially complemented NaCl sensitivity of the
   mutant. Transient expression analysis of a WPI6::GFP fusion protein in
   onion epidermal cells revealed that WPI6 is localized in the plasma
   membrane. Taken together, these data suggested that WPI6 may have a
   protective role in maintaining plasma membrane function during cold
   acclimation in wheat.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Diazepam is widely used to relieve preoperative anxiety in
   patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of
   polymorphism in CYP2C19 and the effects of CYP3A4 messenger ribonucleic
   acid (mRNA) content in blood on recovery from general anesthesia and on
   diazepam pharmacokinetics.
   Methods. Sixty-three Japanese patients were classified into the
   following 3 genotype (phenotype) groups on the basis of polymerase chain
   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of CYP2C19
   polymorphism: no variants, {*}1/{*}1 (extensive metabolizer {[}EM]); 1
   variant, {*}1/{*}2 or {*}1/{*}3 (intermediate metabolizer {[}IM]); and 2
   variants, {*}2/{*}2, {*}2/{*}3, or {*}3/{*}3 (poor metabolizer {[}PM]).
   We assessed the effects of these polymorphisms and of CYP3A4 mRNA
   content in the lymphocytes on the patients' recovery from general
   anesthesia.
   Results. CYP2C19 genotyping analysis in the 63 subjects showed that
   32\%, 46\%, and 22\% of subjects were classified into the EM, IM, and PM
   groups, respectively. The PM subjects showed a larger area under the
   curve representing the concentration of diazepam over a 24-hour period
   (AUC(0-24)) (2088 +/- 378 ng/ mL (.) h(-1), P = .0259), lower clearance
   of diazepam (0.049 +/- 0.009 L (.) h(-1) (.) kg(-1), P = .0287), and
   longer emergence time (median, 18 minutes; 25th-75th percentile range,
   13-21 minutes; P < .001) in comparison with subjects in the EM group
   (AUC(0-24), 1412 +/- 312 ng/mL; clearance, 0.074 +/- 0.018 L (.) h(-1)
   (.) kg(-1); and emergence time, 10 minutes, 8-12 minutes {[}median and
   25th-75th percentile range]). The IM group also showed a longer
   emergence time (median, 13 minutes; 25th-75th percentile range, 9-20
   minutes; P < .001) and a larger variation in this parameter in
   comparison with the EM group. The distributions of the CYP2C19 genotype
   were significantly different between the 2 groups (rapid emergence < 20
   minutes, slow emergence > 20 minutes) (P = .0148). The mean value of the
   CYP3A4 mRNA level in the slow-emergence group (mean +/- SD, 4.80 +/-
   3.99 X 10(-10)) was significantly lower than that of the rapid-emergence
   group (mean +/- SD, 12.50 +/- 11.90 X 10(-10)) (P = .0315). However,
   there was no significant correlation between emergence time and CYP3A4
   mRNA levels (r = 0.239, P = .0601).
   Conclusion: We found that the CYP2C19 genotype affects diazepam
   pharmacokinetics and emergence from general anesthesia and that the
   slow-emergence group possesses lower levels of CYP3A4 mRNA than are
   found in the rapid-emergence group.}},

Title = {{The roots of roots of theological argumentation justifying terrorist
   suicide in the ultra-fundamentalism}},

Abstract = {{As far as cults dealing with the extreme (including mass suicides) are
   concerned, an important literature has shown the insufficient or even
   the non scientific character of theories which are only making reference
   to psychopathology or ``brainwashing{''}. Moreover, several researches
   on ultra-fondamentalist ``martyrdom{''} showed how the question of the
   economic discomfort of the candidate to-suicide was not sufficient
   either. It is thus important to also focus on theology. On the one hand,
   this paper explores the theological genealogy of this phenomenon in
   Islam, based on the theories of E Khosrokhavar (who sees in the
   post-Khomeinist Shi'ism, the matrix of a theology capable of justifying
   suicide attacks). There is no doubt about the origin of this matrix,
   even if the arguments developed by F. Khosrokhavar have sometimes been
   criticised. On the other hand, unlike the numerous condemnations from
   recognised Islamic authorities towards al-Qaida, the author shows that
   the local djihad campaigns are facing little religious or juridical
   opposition in the Islamic world. Based on the analysis of a fatwa -
   ``Hawa Barayev: suicide or martyrdom?{''} (2000) - and the document from
   al-Qaida - ``The last night{''} - a text probably written by, Mohammed
   Atta, the author shows how suicide terrorism is perceived and justified
   in the ultra-fundamentalist circles.}},

Title = {{The interplay of increased urea synthesis and reduced ammonia production

   aestivation in a mucus cocoon}},

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the rate of urea
   synthesis in Protopterus aethiopicus was up-regulated to detoxify
   ammonia during the initial phase of aestivation in air (day 1-day 12),
   and that a profound suppression of ammonia production occurred at a
   later phase of aestivation (day 35-day 46) which eliminated the need to
   sustain the increased rate of urea synthesis. Fasting apparently led to
   a greater rate of nitrogenous waste excretion in P. aethiopicus in
   water, which is an indication of increases in production of endogenous
   ammonia and urea probably as a result of increased proteolysis and amino
   acid catabolism for energy production. However, 46 days of fasting had
   no significant effects on the ammonia or urea contents in the muscle,
   liver, plasma and brain. In contrast, there were significant decreases
   in the muscle ammonia content in fish after 12, 34 or 46 days of
   aestivation in air when compared with fish fasting in water. Ammonia was
   apparently detoxified to urea because urea contents in the muscle,
   liver, plasma and brain of P. aethiopicus aestivated for 12, 34 or 46
   days were significantly greater than the corresponding fasting control;
   the greatest increases in urea contents occurred during the initial 12
   days. There were also significant increases in activities of some of the
   hepatic ornithine-urea cycle enzymes from fish aestivated for 12 or 46
   days. Therefore, contrary to a previous report on P. aethiopicus, our
   results demonstrated an increase in the estimated rate of urea synthesis
   (2.8-fold greater than the day 0 fish) in this lungfish during the
   initial 12 days of aestivation. However, the estimated rate of urea
   synthesis decreased significantly during the next 34 days. Between day
   35 and day 46 (12 days), urea synthesis apparently decreased to 42\% of
   the day 0 control value, and this is the first report of such a
   phenomenon in African lungfish undergoing aestivation. On the other
   hand, the estimated rate of ammonia production in P. aethiopicus
   increased slightly (14.7\%) during the initial 12 days of aestivation as
   compared with that in the day 0 fish. By contrast, the estimated rate of
   ammonia production decreased by 84\% during the final 12 days of
   aestivation (day 35-day 46) compared with the day 0 value. Therefore, it
   can be concluded that P. aethiopicus depended mainly on increased urea
   synthesis to ameliorate ammonia toxicity during the initial phase of
   aestivation, but during prolonged aestivation, it suppressed ammonia
   production profoundly, eliminating the need to increase urea synthesis
   which is energy-intensive.}},

Abstract = {{Two third-generation aromatase inhibitors, letrozole and anastrozole,
   and the antiestrogen tamoxifen, were compared for growth-inhibiting
   activity in two estrogen receptor (ER)-positive aromatase-overexpressing
   human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7aro and T-47Daro. Inhibition of
   hormone (1 nM testosterone)-stimulated proliferation was evaluated in
   both monolayer cultures and in three-dimensional spheroid cultures.
   Letrozole and anastrozole were also compared for effectiveness of
   aromatase inhibition, and relative affinity for aromatase, under both
   monolayer and spheroid growth conditions.
   Letrozole was an effective inhibitor of MCF-7aro monolayer cell
   proliferation, with an estimated 50\% inhibitory concentration (IC50) Of
   50-100 nM, whereas an IC50 was not reached with anastrozole at any
   concentration tested (100-500 nM). An IC50 of tamoxifen was 1000 nM.
   Proliferation of T-47Daro monolayer cells was more sensitive to
   inhibition by all three agents; as with MCF-7aro cells, letrozole was
   the most effective inhibitor.
   MCF-7aro spheroids were slightly less sensitive than monolayer cells
   proliferation-inhibiting effects of letrozole (IC50 about 200 nM), and
   there was no significant inhibition with 100-200 nM anastrozole or
   200-1000 nM tamoxifen. Letrozole and anastrozole significantly inhibited
   T-47Daro spheroid cell proliferation, at 15-25 and 50 nM, respectively,
   consistent with the greater sensitivity of T-47Daro monolayer cells to
   inhibition of proliferation by these agents. Tamoxifen failed to
   significantly inhibit T-47Daro spheroid cell proliferation over a
   100-500 nM concentration range.
   Determination of aromatase inhibition in monolayers of both cell lines
   by a direct-access microsomal assay and an intact-cell assay revealed
   that letrozole was more active than anastrozole in monolayers of both
   cell lines and in both assays. In MCF-7aro spheroids following cell
   lysis, only letrozole significantly inhibited aromatase activity,
   supporting the conclusion that letrozole binds stronger to aromatase
   than anastrozole does. Our results demonstrate that MCF-7aro and
   T-47Daro spheroids could be a suitable model for evaluation of
   growth-inhibitory effects of agents used in hormonal therapy of breast
   cancer. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we address the problem of predicting the position of a
   moving lung tumor during respiration on the basis of external breathing
   signals-a technique used for beam gating, tracking, and other dynamic
   motion management techniques in radiation therapy. We demonstrate the
   use of neural network filters to correlate tumor position with external
   surrogate markers while simultaneously predicting the motion ahead in
   time, for situations in which neither the breathing pattern nor the
   correlation between moving anatomical elements is constant in time. One
   pancreatic cancer patient and two lung cancer patients with mid/upper
   lobe tumors were fluoroscopically imaged to observe tumor motion
   synchronously with the movement of external chest markers during free
   breathing. The external marker position was provided as input to a
   feed-forward neural network that correlated the marker and tumor
   movement to predict the tumor position up to 800 ms in advance. The
   predicted tumor position was compared to its observed position to
   establish the accuracy with which the filter could dynamically track
   tumor motion under nonstationary conditions. These results were compared
   to simplified linear versions of the filter. The two lung cancer
   patients exhibited complex respiratory behavior in which the correlation
   between surrogate marker and tumor position changed with each cycle of
   breathing. By automatically and continuously adjusting its parameters to
   the observations, the neural network achieved better tracking accuracy
   than the fixed and adaptive linear filters. Variability and instability
   in human respiration complicate the task of predicting tumor position
   from surrogate breathing signals. Our results show that adaptive
   signal-processing filters can provide more accurate tumor position
   estimates than simpler stationary filters when presented with
   nonstationary breathing motion. (c) 2005 American Association of

   thermalized in a catcher gas cell injected into an RF ion-guide and then
   into an ion trap to be cooled, bunched and entered into the

Abstract = {{We report a resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study on
   perovskite manganese oxides La1-xSrMnO3 (x=0, 0.2, and 0.4) at Mn
   K-absorption edge. Hole-doping effect on the electronic excitations in
   the strongly correlated electron systems is elucidated by comparing with
   undoped LaMnO3. The scattering spectra of metallic La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 show
   that a salient peak appears in low energies indicating the persistence
   of the Mott gap. At the same time, the energy gap is partly filled by
   doping holes and the spectral weight shifts toward lower energies.
   Though the peak position of the excitations shows weak dispersion in
   momentum dependence, RIXS intensity changes as a function of the
   scattering angle (2 theta), which is related to the anisotropy.
   Furthermore, anisotropic temperature dependence is observed in
   La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 which shows a metal-insulator transition associated with
   a ferromagnetic transition. We consider that the anisotropy in the RIXS
   spectra is possibly attributed to the correlation of the orbital degrees
   of freedom. The anisotropy is large in LaMnO3 with long-range orbital
   order, while it is small but finite in hole-doped La1-xSrxMnO3 which
   indicates persistence of short-range orbital correlation. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Background Previous studies demonstrated that adrenomedullin (AM) is
   metabolized by neutral endopeptidases and that the renal effect of AM is
   augmented by the inhibition of neutral endopeptidases. We have recently
   shown that the long-term administration of AM has renoprotective
   effects. Object This study assessed the chronic renoprotective effects
   of AM combined with a vasopeptidase inhibitor in hypertensive rats and
   attempted to elucidate the mechanism involved.
   Methods We studied the following four groups: control Dahl
   salt-resistant (DR) rats, untreated Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats,
   omapatrilat (35 mg/kg per day)-treated DS rats; and human AM (500 ng/h)
   plus omapatrilat-treated DS rats. After 7 weeks' treatment, blood
   pressure, renal function, neurohumoral factors, gene expression levels,
   and histological findings were examined.
   Results DS rats were characterized by increased blood pressure,
   decreased renal function, abnormal histological findings, and increased
   gene expression of collagen I and III, transforming growth factor beta
   (TGF-beta), and NADPH oxidase subunits (p40phox, p47phox, and gp91 phox)
   in the renal cortex compared with DR rats. Compared with DS rats,
   omapatrilat significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (-26 mmHg),
   improved renal function, histological findings, and messenger RNA
   expression levels of collagen 1, collagen III, and TGF-beta. Combined
   treatment with omapatrilat and AM further improved renal function,
   histological findings, and mRNA expression levels of collagen 1,
   collagen III, and TGF-beta, without a further reduction in blood
   pressure. Only combined treatment decreased mRNA levels of p40phox,
   p47phox, and gp91 phox. There were no differences in plasma AM or atrial
   natriuretic peptide levels among three DS groups.
   Conclusion Our results suggest that combined treatment with omapatrilat
   and AM provides additional renoprotective effects independent of blood
   pressure-lowering activity partly via inhibition of gene expressions of
   oxidative stress and extracellular matrix.}},

   Remarkable changes are found in the spectra when the temperature is

Abstract = {{Multiwavelength thermal lens technique has been carried out to determine
   the fluorescence quantum efficiency of Nd3+ ions in the NdAl3(BO3)(4)
   stoichiometric microchip laser crystal. The value obtained for the
   quantum efficiency, around 0.30, is an anomalously high value when
   compared with other Nd3+ stoichiometric crystals. Other parameters of
   great relevance in the laser performance (such as thermal diffusivity,
   thermal conductivity, and temperature induced path length change) have
   been also estimated. From the analysis of thermal lens measurements
   under different excitation intensities we have obtained the upconversion
   parameter. By comparing this experimental value with that calculated
   from the microscopic theory we have been able to determine the energy
   migration assisted upconversion as the dominant mechanism, in the
   excitation power regime used. Finally, we have concluded that energy
   transfer upconversion processes strongly reduce the metastable quantum
   efficiency constituting a non-negligible heat source in strongly pumped
   NdAl3(BO3)(4) crystals.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies were conducted in southwestern Virginia to determine the
   ovipositional preferences of Culex restuans and Culex pipiens by using
   ovitraps and gravid traps baited with selected infusions. For the
   ovitrap collections, 4 different infusions (manure, hay, grass, and
   rabbit chow) were used. Significant differences among infusions were
   detected on most sample dates for both species. For 3 of the first 4 wk
   of collections, the manure infusion collected significantly more Cx.
   restuans than all the other infusions. The hay and grass infusions
   collected the majority of the egg rafts during weeks 5-9. Cx. pipiens
   egg rafts were absent from the first 3 wk of collections. Of the
   remaining 6 wk, 4 showed significant differences in attractiveness of
   infusions, with the hay and grass infusions preferred by Cx. pipiens.
   Two infusions, manure and hay, were used for the gravid trap experiment
   and both Cx. restuans and Cx. pipiens data were combined for analysis.
   Only the first 2 wk showed significance, with manure being preferred
   over hay in both weeks. In later collections, the relative
   attractiveness of the hay infusion increased. A seasonal shift in
   infusion preference may be related to incubation temperature during
   preparation of the infusions. New infusions were prepared each week and
   incubation was done outside. Increased attractiveness of the hay
   infusion coincided with higher average temperatures in July and August.
   Hay infusion was very effective for trapping both Cx. pipiens and Cx.
   restuans in southwestern Virginia and is more convenient to use than
   manure. However, cool outside temperatures in the early season may
   interfere with the fermentation process and thus incubation should be

Abstract = {{The plant-colonizing Pseudomonas fluorescens strain SBW25 harbors a gene
   cluster (rsp) whose products show similarity to type III protein
   secretion systems found in plant and animal pathogens. Here we report a
   detailed analysis of the expression and regulation of the P.fluorescens
   rsp pathway, both in the phytosphere and in vitro. A combination of
   chromosomally integrated transcriptional reporter fusions, overexpressed
   regulatory genes, and specific mutants reveal that promoters controlling
   expression of rsp are actively transcribed in the plant rhizosphere but
   not (with the exception of the rspC promoter) in the phyllosphere. In
   synthetic medium, regulatory (rspL and rspR) and structural (rspU, plus
   the putative effector ropE) genes are poorly expressed; the rspC
   promoter is subject to an additional level of regulatory control.
   Ectopic expression of regulatory genes in wild-type and mutant
   backgrounds showed that RspR controls transcription of the alternate
   sigma factor, rspL, and that RspL controls expression of gene clusters
   encoding structural genes. Mutation of rspV did not affect RspR-mediated
   expression of rspU. A search for additional regulators revealed two
   candidates-one with a role in the conversion of alanine to
   pyruvate-suggesting that expression of rsp is partly dependent upon the
   metabolic status of the cell. Mutations in rsp regulators resulted in a
   significant reduction in competitive colonization of the root tips of
   sugar beet seedlings but also caused a marked increase in the lag phase
   of laboratory-grown cultures, indicating that rsp regulatory genes play
   a more significant general role in the function of P. fluorescens SBW25
   than previously appreciated.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is one of the most abundant classes of
   phospholipids and is a major component of membranes in biological
   systems. Recently, PCs have been detected by direct tissue analysis
   using MALDI-TOFMS. However, these studies did not allow for the
   structural characterization of PCs in tissue. In the current study, an
   in situ method for detection and structural analysis of PC species in
   brain tissue was developed using a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer.
   Initial profiling of lipids in tissue is performed by MALDI-TOFMS, which
   allows for the assignment of PC species. However, to confirm the
   structure of the PC species detected in tissue, MALDI-MS/MS analysis was
   employed. In this work, protonated, sodiated, and potassiated PC species
   were detected in brain tissue using DHA matrix. MALDI-MS/MS analysis of
   these species yielded fragments that verified a phosphocholine head
   group, but did not supply any fragments that would permit the
   identification of acyl substituents. To obtain more structural
   information, lithium adducts of PC species were produced using DHA
   matrix dissolved in 100 mM lithium chloride. MALDI-MS/MS analysis of
   lithiated PC species produced fragments that allowed for the
   identification and positional assignment of acyl groups in PC species.}},

Abstract = {{In the development of damascene copper interconnects for the 90 and 65
   nm technology nodes, several diffusion barriers were considered. Among
   barrier films a TaN/Ta bilayer is preferred because of its excellent
   adhesion to dielectrics and good barrier properties. In a typical
   process, the bilayer deposition includes four steps: TaN deposition,
   target reconditioning, Ta deposition, and resputtering. In this study,
   we define critical process parameters and characterize thin barriers for
   improved effective line and via resistance.
   Results on blanket wafers indicate that the TaN deposition time directly
   influences barrier thickness while the Ta deposition time mainly
   influences sheet resistance and the full bilayer stack. Additionally,
   decreasing DC power and deposition time does not induce any change on
   Ta; however, TaN films are influenced by DC power and deposition as
   shown by XRD.
   Critical parameters influencing the 90 nm technology performance include
   deposition time of TaN and Ta. Gas flows or bias resputtering show no
   significant impact on sheet resistance or film properties within the
   scope of this study. Experiments on 65 nm node highlight the role played
   by the tantalum deposition on the via chain yield.
   These results presented in this paper clarify the role of individual
   process steps during the barrier deposition. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, the sliding mode observers design techniques for MIMO and
   as a simple example for SISO systems are systematically advanced as a
   first purpose. Design parameters are selected such that on the defined

   mode. Moreover, observer state error dynamics is globally robustly
   asymptotically stable. Then, advanced design techniques are generalized
   to the design of a new modification of sliding mode observers for
   uncertain MIMO systems with time-delay. Robust sliding and global
   asymptotic stability conditions are derived by using Lyapunov-Krasovskii
   V-functional method. By these conditions observer parameters are
   designed such that an asymptotically stable sliding mode always is
   generated in observer and observer state error dynamics is robustly
   globally asymptotically stable. The main results are formulated in terms
   of Lyapunov matrix equations and inequalities. Design example for AV-8A
   Harrier VTOL aircraft with simulation results using MATLAB-Simulink show
   the effectiveness of proposed design approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Study objectives: Infection with specific high-risk HPV types 16 and IS
   and polymorphism of p53 codon 72 has been strongly associated with the
   genesis of various neoplasms in humans, but such study in lung cancer is
   limited and the results are controversial. In India, the role of these
   two factors has been strongly implicated in cervical and other cancers,
   but the occurrence of HPV or p53 codon 72 polymorphism has not been
   examined in lung cancer, which is the most common cause of
   cancer-related death in India.
   Design and patients: A total of 40 tumor biopsy specimens from advanced
   lung cancer patients and blood samples from 40 matching control subjects
   were obtained for the analysis of high-risk HPV types 16 and 18
   infection and p53 codon 72 polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: Only HPV type IS was detected in 5\% (2 of 40 lung cancer
   patients), but no other HPV could be detected. A significantly increased
   frequency of Arg/Arg homozygotes, was observed in patients with advanced
   lung cancer when compared to that of control subjects (p = 0.004; odds
   ratio, 5.13; 95\% confidence interval, 1.59 to 17.26). However, no
   significant correlation could be made between p53 polymorphism and
   different clinical stages, except for advanced stage IN, patients, who
   showed a higher proportion of Arg/Pro heterozygous genotype.
   Conclusions: HPV detected in a small proportion of lung cancer patients
   in India demonstrated an exclusive prevalence of HPV type 18, and there
   was a significantly higher frequency of p53 Arg/Arg genotype when
   compared to that of control subjects. Observation of a shorter duration
   of symptoms (<= 4 months) in as many as 78\% (seven of nine stage IV
   patients) with Arg/Pro genotype may be an indication that lung cancer
   patients with the heterozygous p53 genotype are more susceptible to
   early progression.}},

Abstract = {{The long posterior flap technique is an established technique for
   trans-tibial amputation in ischaemic limbs. Despite its success, it has
   a few drawbacks. It may be time-consuming and requires considerable
   planning, and at times the dog-ears cannot be avoided. The suture line
   passes over the distal end of the stump, which is usually a problem
   during prosthetic use. The skew flap technique retains the advantages of
   the long posterior flap technique and eliminates the difficulties of
   prosthetic fitting. The equal skin flaps are skewed so that the flaps
   become anteromedial and posterolateral, whereas the calf muscle flap
   remains long underneath the skewed skin flaps. The posterior muscles are
   brought anteriorly covering the cut ends of the bones and are buried in
   between the tibia and its anterior periosteum, by suturing their margins
   with the periosteum. The skew flap procedure was perceived in 1980 and
   was started at the Artificial Limb Centre, Pune in 1983 by the author.
   Ibis procedure underwent many changes during the initial 5 years and by
   the end of April 1992, 85 trans-tibial amputations were performed using
   this technique. A 9-year follow-up of these patients, who had been using
   prostheses with ease and without any discomfort or problem, had been
   exceptionally good. Encouraged by the results, this technique is now
   being practised as routinely. By March 1998, a total of 125 such
   trans-tibial amputations had been performed in 119 patients, with
   excellent results.}},

Abstract = {{Provision of quality of service (QoS) support with mobility has received
   impetus from the evolution that has occurred in mobile communication
   technologies. This is especially the main driver behind 4G/B3G networks
   that will enable a user to access any type of services anytime,
   anywhere, and anyhow. In this paper, we first review some of the
   state-of-the-art techniques in the area of QoS and resource management
   based mobility. We then propose an augmented 4G/B3G architecture that
   addresses key limitations in the salient 4G architectures examined in
   the literature. Our proposed novel augmentations in mobility, QoS, and
   resource management schemes consolidate operation of the 4G
   architecture. The other defining attributes of our proposed 4G
   architecture are that it is open, hierarchical, layered, and modular
   with cross-layer coordination and distributed network functionalities.
   Well-defined message interfaces enable the layers/levels within the
   architecture to support cross-layer coordination under dynamic network
   conditions. A signaling network that operates independent of the
   heterogeneous access networks in the architecture is incorporated to
   carry out wireless system discovery and paging. This facilitates to
   conserve mobile terminal's battery power. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Motivation: Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy has become established
   as a key method for determining the secondary structure contents of
   proteins which has had a significant impact on molecular biology. Many
   excellent mathematical protocols have been developed for this purpose
   and their quality is above question. However, reference database sets of
   proteins, with CD spectra matched to secondary structure components
   derived from X-ray structures, provide the key resource for this task.
   These databases were created many years ago, before most CD
   spectrophotometers became standardized and before it was commonplace to
   validate X-ray structures prior to publication. The analyses presented
   here were undertaken to investigate the overall quality of these
   reference databases in light of their extensive usage in determining
   protein secondary structure content from CD spectra.
   Results: The analyses show that there are a number of significant
   problems associated with the CD reference database sets in current use.
   There are disparities between CD spectra for the same protein collected
   by different groups. These include differences in magnitudes, peak
   positions or both. However, many current reference sets are now
   amalgamations of spectra from these groups, introducing inconsistencies
   that can lead to inaccuracies in the determination of secondary
   structure components from the CD spectra. A number of the X-ray
   structures used fall short on the validation criteria now employed as
   standard for structure determination. Many have substantial percentages
   of residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Hence
   their calculated secondary structure components, used as a foundation
   for the reference databases, are likely to be in error. Additionally,
   the coverage of secondary structure space in the reference datasets is
   poorly correlated to the secondary structure components found in the
   Protein Data Bank. A conclusion is that a new reference CD database with
   cross-correlated, machine-independent CD spectra and validated X-ray
   structures that cover more secondary structure components, including
   diverse protein folds, is now needed. However, that reasonably accurate
   values for the secondary structure content of proteins can be determined
   from spectra is a testament to CD spectroscopy being a very powerful
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{Rib discoloration in crisphead lettuce (Lactuca sativa) has been
   successfully induced by applying heat stress. Two studies were conducted
   to determine the effect of short periods (3 and 5 days) of high
   temperatures (35/25 degrees C and 35/15 degrees C day/night
   temperatures) at various developmental stages (at heading, and at 1, 2,
   and 3 weeks after heading) on rib discoloration incidence and severity.
   Lettuce (cv. Ithaca) was most sensitive to heat stress 2 weeks after
   heading: applying 35/25 degrees C or 35/15 degrees C day/night
   temperatures for 3 or 5 days resulted on average in 46\% of mature heads
   with rib discoloration symptoms. Stressing plants at earlier or later
   stages resulted in significantly lower incidences of the disorder, with
   only 4\% to17\% plants showing symptoms. More leaves were affected by
   the disorder when beat stress was applied 2 weeks after heading than
   when the stress was applied earlier or later. Night temperature and
   stress duration had no effect on the incidence and severity of rib
   discoloration. Up to eight leaves, located between the first and
   fifteenth leaves acropetal to the cap leaf, showed symptoms. This report
   establishes a direct relationship between rib discoloration and heat
   stress, proposes a new method to help lettuce breeders screen germplasm
   for rib discoloration tolerance, and supports the development of tools
   for predicting the occurrence of rib discoloration in the field
   according to meteorological data.}},

Abstract = {{Periventricular leukomalacia is a form of white-matter injury that
   occurs in the setting of either primary or secondary hypoxia-ischemia in
   the premature infant. Hypoxia-ischemia induces increases in cerebral
   extracellular glutamate levels, thereby activating glutamate receptors
   on a variety of cell types within the white matter. This review examines
   the evidence of a role for glutamate receptors in white-matter injury
   and periventricular leukomalacia. Multiple glutamate receptor subtypes
   exist, and these appear to play differential roles depending on cell
   type and time after injury. Glutamate receptors are developmentally
   regulated on neurons and glia, and certain subtypes are transiently
   overexpressed in developing rodent brain and are expressed on immature
   oligodendrocytes in human white matter in the premature period.
   Pharmacologic agents acting on glutamate receptors might represent
   age-specific therapeutic strategies for the treatment of periventricular
   leukomnalacia.}},

Abstract = {{Pulmonary bacterial diseases are a leading cause of mortality in the
   U.S. Innate immune response is vital for bacterial clearance from the
   lung, and TLRs play a critical role in this process. Toll-IL-1R
   domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) is a key molecule in the TLR4
   and 2 signaling. Despite its potential importance, the role of
   TIRAP-mediated signaling in lung responses has not been examined. Our
   goals were to determine the role of TIRAP-dependent signaling in the
   induction of lung innate immune responses against Escherichia coli LPS
   and viable E. coli, and in lung defense against E. coli in mice.
   LPS-induced neutrophil sequestration; NF-icB translocation; keratinocyte
   cell-derived chemokine, MIP-2, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 expression;
   histopathology; and VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression were abolished in the
   lungs of TIRAP(-/-) mice. A cell-permeable TIRAP blocking peptide
   attenuated LPS-induced lung responses. Furthermore, immune responses in
   the lungs of TIRAP(-/-) mice were attenuated against E. coli compared
   with TIRAP(-/-) mice. TIRAP(-/-) mice also had early mortality, higher
   bacterial burden in the lungs, and more bacterial dissemination
   following E. coli inoculation. Moreover, we used human alveolar
   macrophages to examine the role of TIRAP signaling in the human system.
   The TIRAP blocking peptide abolished LPS-induced TNF-alpha, IL-6, and
   IL-8 expression in alveolar macrophages, whereas it attenuated E.
   coli-induced expression of these cytokines and chemokines. Taken
   together, this is the first study illustrating the crucial role of TIRAP
   in the generation of an effective early immune response against E. coli
   LPS and viable E. coli, and in lung defense against a bacterial
   pathogen.}},

   The extent of As(V) adsorption on TiO2 decreased with increasing pH due
   to the decrease of positively charged binding sites on the TiO2 surface.
   The Langmuir maximum uptake capacity at pH 4 is about three times higher
   than that at pH 7. Here we show that the relatively low As(V) uptake at
   circumneutral pH could be substantially enhanced by the addition of
   common divalent cations such as magnesium and calcium. At a
   concentration of approximately 7 mM, magnesium and calcium increased the
   extent of As(V) adsorption from 2.1 to 6.5 and 7.7 mg As(V)/g TiO2,

Abstract = {{Nano-metal nickel powder was prepared by plasma arc spraying method. It
   is found that the efficiency of collection system is lower than designed
   target. The finer powder particle is, the lower collection rate is. As
   far as transportation process for the multi-phases flow between gas and
   nano solid particle, the sedimentation pattern varies from gravitation
   pattern to thermo-natatorial one. When particle size varies from 10 gm
   to 50 nm, the ratio between thermo-natatorial force and gravity force
   incline from 0.07 to 2820 and the ratio between thermo-natatorial force
   and Magnus force incline from 0.02 to 945. With the incline of
   temperature gradient and the decline of particle size, the
   thermo-natatorial influence is more remarkable.}},

Abstract = {{The nanocrystallization behaviour of Zr70Cu20Ni10 metallic glass during

   incorporating with a modified Ising model and a Q-state Potts model.
   Based on the simulated microstructure and differential scanning
   calorimetry curves, we find that the low crystal-amorphous interface
   energy of Ni plays an important role in the nanocrystallization of
   primary Zr2Ni. It is found that when T < T-Imax (where T-Imax is the
   temperature with maximum nucleation rate), the increase of temperature
   results in a larger growth rate and a much finer microstructure for the
   primary Zr2Ni, which accords with the microstructure evolution in
   ``flash annealing{''}. Finally, the Zr2Ni/Zr2Cu interface energy
   sigma(G) contributes to the pinning effect of the primary nano-sized
   Zr2Ni grains in the later formed normal Zr2Cu grains.}},

Abstract = {{DNA vaccines induce protective Immoral and cell-mediated immune

   study, we report that coadministration of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA
   vaccine with prothymosin a as an adjuvant improves antibody responses to
   HBV S antigen. We also observed higher seroconversion rates and higher
   antibody titers. Prothymosin alpha appears to increase the number and
   affinity of hepatitis B surface antigen-specific, gamma
   interferon-secreting T cells and to enhance cellular immune response to
   the PreS2S DNA vaccine. Interestingly, administering the DNA separately
   from the prothymosin of plasmid abrogated the enhancement of DNA vaccine
   potency. The results suggest that prothymosin alpha may be a promising

Abstract = {{Non-target effects of a bacterial (Pseudomonas fluorescens DR54) and a
   fungal (Clonostachys rosea IK726) microbial control agent (MCA), on the
   indigenous microbiota in bulk soil and rhizosphere of barley, and
   subsequent a sugar beet crop, were studied in a greenhouse experiment.
   MCAs were introduced by seed and soil inoculation. Bulk and rhizosphere
   soils were sampled regularly during the growth of barley and sugar beet.
   The soils were assayed for the fate of MCAs and various features of the
   indigenous soil microbiota. At the end of the experiment (193 d), DR54
   and IK726 had declined by a factor of 106 and 20, respectively, and DR54
   showed a short-lasting growth increase in the sugar beet rhizosphere. In
   general, the non-target effects were small and transient. IK726 seemed
   to have general stimulating effects on soil enzyme activity and the soil
   microbiota, and resulted in a significant increase in plant dry weight.
   The plant growth-promoting effect of DR54 was less pronounced and the
   DR54 displaced indigenous pseudomonads. DR54 stimulated growth of
   protozoans with a tolerance for the anti-fungal compound viscosinamide
   produced by DR54. Treatment with the fungicide Fungazil had no effects
   on plant growth or soil microorganisms. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA)
   analysis detected the perturbations of the soil microbial community
   structure in the MCA treatments as well as the return to non-perturbed
   conditions reflecting the decline of inoculant populations. The PLFA
   technique appears to be suitable for in situ monitoring of MCA
   non-target effects on the soil microbiota, but should be combined with
   assays for MCA survival and soil enzyme activity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Elderly minorities are more likely to die in inpatient settings than
   their Caucasian counterparts. It is not known whether this difference is
   due to cultural preferences for place of death or decreased access to
   hospice. This analysis examines ethnic differences in the place of death
   of elderly hospice patients.
   Using data from a large, national hospice provider, elderly (>= 65)
   African-American, Hispanic, and Caucasian decedents admitted to hospice
   between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2003, were identified. Of the
   115,854 eligible decedents, 78.3\% were Caucasian, 10.7\% African
   American, and 11\% Hispanic. Hispanics and African Americans were more
   likely to die in inpatient hospice settings than Caucasians (38.5\%,
   38.5\%, and 32\%, respectively). After adjustment for demographic and
   hospice use variables, older African Americans had higher odds than
   older Caucasians of dying in an inpatient hospice setting than a nursing
   home (odds ratio (OR)=1.12, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-1.19).
   However, African-American ethnicity was not a significant predictor of
   death in an inpatient setting versus home (OR=1.03, 95\% CI=0.97-1.08)).
   Hispanics had lower odds than Caucasians of death in an inpatient
   hospice setting than at home (OR=0.88, 95\% CI=0.84, 0.93) and higher
   odds of death in an inpatient setting than a nursing home (OR=1.45, 95\%
   CI=1.37-1.53).
   Admission to hospice reduces but does not eliminate ethnic differences
   in place of death. Further research should examine the effect of
   individual and cultural preferences for place of death on decisions to
   enroll in hospice.}},

Abstract = {{Queensland's post-First World War Soldier Settlement Scheme, begun with
   noble and optimistic intentions in 1916, officially terminated in 1929
   after ignominious failure. There were a number of factors which
   contributed to the erosion and ultimate destruction of this phase of
   land settlement, but Commonwealth-State antagonism and the incompetence
   of many State agricultural advisers were certainly significant elements.
   Beerburrum, just north of Brisbane, was one of the largest groups of
   settlements which characterised Queensland's attempts to turn swords
   into ploughshares. Beerburrum soldier settlers and their families strove
   valiantly to extract a basic living in the face of overwhelming
   adversity, and an examination of their circumstances offers a valuable
   window into the trials and tribulations of the entire scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Study design: Postintervention.
   Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of the Praxis multifunctional
   implantable functional electrical stimulation ( FES) system ( Neopraxis
   Pty. Ltd, Lane Cove, NSW, Australia) to provide standing and stepping
   ability and bladder and bowel management for individuals with motor
   complete thoracic level spinal cord injuries ( SCI).
   Setting: Pediatric orthopedic hospital specializing in SCI.
   Subjects: Three males, ages 17 and 21 years, with motor- complete
   thoracic level SCI and intact lower motor neurons to the muscles
   targeted for stimulation.
   Methods: Each subject was successfully implanted with the Praxis FES
   system. All three subjects received electrodes for upright mobility and
   the. first two subjects received additional electrodes for stimulated
   bladder and bowel management. Following training, subjects were
   evaluated in their ability to use FES for nine mobility activities.
   Acute and chronic experiments of the effect of stimulation on bowel and
   bladder function were also performed.
   Results: All three subjects could independently stand up from the
   wheelchair and could walk at least 6m using a swing through gait
   pattern. Two subjects were able to independently perform swing through
   gait for 6 min and one subject was able to independently ascend and
   descend stairs. Suppression of re. ex bladder contractions by
   neuromodulation ( subject 1) and stimulated contractions of the rectum (
   subject 2) were observed in acute experiments. When stimulation was
   applied over the course of several weeks, a positive effect on bowel
   function was measured. Stimulated bladder contractions were not
   achieved.
   Conclusion: The feasibility of using the Praxis FES system for upright
   mobility and aiding aspects of bladder and bowel function was
   demonstrated with three subjects with thoracic level SCI.}},

Abstract = {{This research evaluated a dual pathway model for body dissatisfaction

   importance of distinguishing between weight and muscularity concerns in
   understanding male body image. A total of 128 boys from grades 8 and 11
   completed a self-report questionnaire. Results indicated that weight and
   muscularity concerns each made unique contributions to body
   dissatisfaction and were associated with distinct individual and peer
   context characteristics. Weight concern was associated with elevated BMI
   and more frequent appearance conversations with friends. Muscularity
   concern was significantly greater among boys who reported more frequent
   muscle-building conversations, had lower BMI, and were older. The
   results support the importance of distinguishing between and assessing
   both muscularity and weight concerns in the development of body image
   dissatisfaction among adolescent boys.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{929-936}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background/Aims: There is increasing interest in the influence of excess
   body weight and associated metabolic factors on the liver. In patients
   with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, lower levels of adiponectin were
   associated with higher grades of hepatic steatosis and necroinflammatory
   activity, suggesting a pathophysiological role for this adipokine in
   liver disease.
   Methods: We studied 194 consecutive patients with untreated chronic HCV,
   to assess the relationship between adiponectin and its receptors and
   hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation.
   Results: Significant negative correlations between serum adiponectin and
   male gender, body mass index and serum insulin were observed. However,
   there was no association between serum adiponectin and stage of fibrosis
   and lower levels of serum adiponectin were associated with the presence
   of steatosis in males only. In contrast, there was a significant
   increase in serum adiponectin and hepatic adiponectin immunoreactivity
   with increasing inflammation. The hepatic mRNA expression of the
   adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, displayed significant but
   opposite associations with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)
   gene expression, a substitute marker of hepatic insulin sensitivity.
   Conclusions: In patients with chronic HCV, adiponectin was associated
   with steatosis only in males and was paradoxically increased with
   inflammation. Our results suggest that the role of adiponectin in
   chronic liver diseases may be linked to gender and etiology. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Since 1998, serological testing was performed at least once annually on
   all the breeding cows and heifers in a herd of 70 dairy cows chronically
   infected with Neospora caninum and which presented with abortions
   associated with this parasite. A blood sample was taken before colostrum
   was consumed in all heifers born since 1998. Results indicated that the
   mode of parasite transmission was horizontal. During a four-year period,
   66 new infections were found in females that were parasite-free at
   birth. This represented an annual rate of 20.6\%. The percentage of
   abortion was significantly higher in chronically infected animals (16\%)
   than in cows testing negative (5.3\%). Among the 37 heifers infected
   after birth, 15 were seronegative in the following 14 months (40\%). An
   explanation for the massive number of seronegative animals is given in
   the article. Among these 37 heifers, 27 went to full-term. One Out Of
   two of their calves were infected, mainly from cows that thereafter
   tested positive (p < 0.05). These observations should be taken into
   account when deciding protocols for culling due to Neospora infection

Abstract = {{The coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate and its analogs were tested for
   inhibition of the self-splicing of primary transcripts of the phage T4
   thymidylate synthase gene (td). Of all compounds examined, the pyridoxal
   phosphate was the most potent inhibitor and the order of inhibitory
   efficiency for compounds tested was as follows: pyridoxal phosphate >
   pyridoxal > pyridoxine > pyridoxamine > pyridoxic acid. Increasing Mg2+
   concentration up to 14 mM overcame the suppression of self-splicing by
   pyridoxal phosphate up to 95\% of the level of normal splicing, implying
   its interference with effective catalysis of Mg2+. The kinetic analysis
   demonstrated that pyridoxal phosphate acts as a mixed type
   noncompetitive inhibitor for the td intron RNA with a K-i of 11.8 mM.
   The specificity of the splicing inhibition by pyridoxal phosphate is
   predominantly due to increases in K-m and decreases in V-max values.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the sulfur removing capacity of the conventional Zn-Ti-based
   H2S removal sorbents, a new Zn-Ti based sorbent (ZT-cp) was prepared by
   the coprecipitation method and tested in a packed bed reactor at middle
   temperature conditions (H2S absorption at 480 degrees C, regeneration at
   580 degrees C). The new Zn-Ti-based sorbent showed excellent sulfur
   removing capacity without deactivation, even after 10 cycles of
   absorption and regeneration. The conventional Zn-Ti-based sorbents
   (ZT-700,ZT-1000), however, that were prepared byphysical mixing,were
   continuously deactivated. In particular, the initial sulfur removing
   capacity of the ZT-cp sorbent showed a very high absorption value (0.22
   g S/g sorbent), which corresponded to 91.6\% of theoretical absorption
   amount. These results can be explained by the difference in physical
   properties such as pore volume, surface area, and particle size. It was
   also found that the sulfides formed from the ZT-cp and ZT-1000 sorbents
   with spinel structure were easily regenerated even at 580 degrees C.
   Those from the ZT-700 sorbent, with separated ZnO and TiO2 structures,

   gabbros and plagiogranites indicate fractionation of mafic magmas in a
   relatively thick thermal lithosphere. This lithosphere was thinned by a
   large shear zone separating different mantle domains. The thermal
   evolution of the shear zone is recorded by porphyroclastic to mylonitic
   plagioclase peridotites. Later, at least parts of the mantle rocks were
   exhumed to the ocean floor, as indicated by widespread serpentinization,
   rodingitization of mafic dikes, local occurrences of ophicarbonates; and
   metabasalts. Possible origins of crustal remnants (pre-alpine granulite)
   within the serpentinites are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the paper is to create a model which enables to observe the
   mechanomyographic (MMG) wave generated during single motor unit
   contractions in a muscle, while the muscle is immersed in paraffin oil.
   The muscle model is described as a rheological membrane. Both the muscle
   and the medium models have been built by using
   Stiff-Finite-Element-Method (SFEM), which allows one to simulate the
   muscle surface displacement and the acoustic propagation of this effect
   in the oil. Such a modelling enables one to determine the impact of the
   rheological properties of the liquid environment on the shape of the MMG
   wave. In order to verify the model, the MMG signals and the contraction
   forces have been recorded in vivo from the medial gastrocnemius muscle
   of a rat. In these experiments single motor units were stimulated with
   various stimulation frequencies. A piezotransducer, immersed in paraffin
   oil, has been used to record the MMG signal recording. The signals
   recorded during individual twitches of the motor units have been used to
   estimate the parameters of the model. Subsequently, the model has been
   experimentally verified. The signals recorded in experiments during
   unfused and fused tetani have been compared with the simulated model
   responses in the analogous stimulation program. It has been observed
   that the MMG signals obtained with the proposed linear model have been
   consistent with the results of in vivo experiments. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{High-field magnetization measurements have been performed up to 56T for
   a two-dimensional S = 1/2 frustrated square-lattice antiferromagnet
   (CuCI)LaNb2O7, a recently discovered spin gap system (Delta/k(B) = 26.7
   K). It is found that the spin gap closes at a surprisingly low field
   H-cl = 10.3 T compared with that expected from the zero-field spin gap
   (Delta/g mu(B) = 18.4 T). For H > H-c1, the magnetization exhibits a
   linear increase without any trace of anomalies such as fractional
   plateaus until it saturates at H-c2 = 30.1 T. This means that the
   gapless phase, where the field-induced magnetic ordering is expected to
   occur at low temperatures, is stable over a wide field region. These
   results suggest strong correlations of triplet excitations in the layer
   and the proximity of the spin-liquid phase to the magnetically ordered

   interfere with adherence electronic monitoring devices (EMD). This study
   examined the characteristics of pillbox users and the implications of

   = 160) currently taking antiretroviral medications (ARVs) completed
   anonymous surveys in a community research setting. Sixty-three (39\%) of
   individuals taking ARVs were currently using a pillbox. Pillbox users
   were significantly more likely to have an undetectable viral load and
   less likely to have missed their medications within a day of the
   assessment. Pillbox users indicated feeling that they benefited from
   using their pillbox and 76\% reported they would likely stop using their
   pillbox if required to participate in a research study that paid them.

Abstract = {{Plasma operation with high-Z plasma facing components is investigated
   with regard to sputtering, core impurity contamination and scenario
   restrictions. A simple model based on dimensionless quantities for fuel
   and high-Z ion sources and transport to describe the high-Z
   concentration in the plasma core is introduced. The impurity release and
   further transport is factorized into the sputtering yield, the relative
   pedestal penetration probability and a core confinement enhancement
   factor. Since there are quite large uncertainties, in particular, in the
   sputtering source and the edge transport of high-Z impurities, very
   different scenarios covering a wide parameter range are taken into
   account in order to resolve the experimental trends. Sputtering of
   tungsten by charge exchange neutrals in the energy range 0.5-2 keV is
   comparable to the effect of impurity ion sputtering, while the impact of
   thermal fuel ions is negligible. Fast ions produced by neutral beam
   injection as well as sheath acceleration during ICR heating may cause
   considerable high-Z sources if the limiters on the lowfield side have
   high-Z surfaces. The critical behaviour of the central high-Z
   concentration in some experimental scenarios could be attributed to edge
   and core transport parameters in the concentration model. The improved
   H-mode with off-central heating turns out to be the most critical one,
   since a hot edge is combined with peaked density profiles.}},

Abstract = {{We derive new algebraic attractor equations describing supersymmetric

   proportional to the gravitino mass (the central charge), is similar to
   the attractor equations for moduli fixed by the charges near the horizon
   of the supersymmetric black holes. The second term does not have a
   counterpart in the theory of black hole attractors. It is proportional
   to a mass matrix mixing axino-dilatino with complex structure modulino.
   This allows stabilization of moduli for vanishing central charge, which
   was not possible for BPS black holes. Finally, we propose a new set of
   attractor equations for non-supersymmetric black holes and for
   non-supersymmetric flux vacua.}},

Abstract = {{The role of an AAA protease FtsH (slr0228) in the turnover of the D1
   protein was studied under moderate heat stress conditions using
   wild-type cells of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 and the
   mutant cells lacking a homologue of FtsH (slr0228). When the growth
   temperature of the wild-type was shifted from 30 degrees C to 40 degrees
   C, growth and oxygen-evolving activity were partially inhibited. Under
   the same heat stress, growth of the mutant was inhibited more
   significantly (63\% inhibition after 5 days heat stress, compared with
   26\% inhibition with the wild-type cells) and the oxygen-evolving
   activity was also impaired in parallel. With heat stress at 42 degrees
   C, the level of the D1 protein of wild type cells was decreased, whereas
   that in mutant cells was not. The responses of cyanobacterial cells to
   heat stress observed here are quite similar to those to light stress
   that were reported previously {[}R Silva, E. Thompson, S. Bailey, O.
   Kruse, C. W. Mullineaux, C. Robinson, N. H. Mann and P. J. Nixon, Plant
   Cell, 2003, 15, 2152-2164, ref. 24]. From these results, we suggest that
   the FtsH protease (slr0228) is responsible for both the heat-induced and
   light-induced degradation of the D1 protein. Notably, the amount of FtsH
   increased when the wild-type cells were exposed to heat stress or light
   stress, indicating that the up-regulation of the FtsH protease in the
   thylakoids is crucial for the cyanobacterial cells to cope with these
   abiotic stresses.}},

   obtained data are compared with those taken from the open literature -in
   the form of real and imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude
   with excellent results. Then, they are used for the numerical
   calculation of both the specific rain attenuation and the exceedance
   probability function, in the case of a hypothetical satellite link

   States. However, minimal longitudinal data exists regarding the medical
   and public health impact because of bombings.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the number of
   incidents, injuries, and deaths because of explosive, incendiary,
   premature, and attempted bombings from January 1983 to December 2002.
   Morbidity and mortality by motives, target locations, and materials used
   were evaluated.
   Results: In the United States, 36,110 bombing incidents, 5,931 injuries,
   and 699 deaths were reported. There were 21,237 (58.8\%) explosive
   bombings, 6,185 (17.1\%) incendiary bombings, 1,107 (3.1\%) premature
   bombings, and 7,581 (21.0\%) attempted bombings. For explosive bombings
   with known motives, 72.9\% of injuries and 73.8\% of deaths were because
   of homicide. For incendiary bombings with known motives, 68.2\% of
   injuries were because of extortion and revenge, and 53.5\% of deaths
   were due to homicide. Private residences accounted for 29.0\% of
   incidents, 31.5\% of injuries, and 55.5\% of deaths. Government
   installations accounted for 4.4\% of incidents but were the site of
   12.7\% of injuries and 25.5\% of deaths. In bombings with known
   materials, nitrate-based fertilizers accounted for 36.2\% of injuries
   and 30.4\% of deaths, and smokeless powder and black powder accounted
   for 33.2\% of injuries and 27.1\% of deaths.
   Conclusions: Illegal bombings and related injuries commonly occur in the
   United States. Because of the easy availability of bombing materials,
   government agencies and healthcare providers should prepare for
   potential mass-casualty bombings.}},

Abstract = {{A study on the dynamic characteristics of rigid foundations with special
   geometries such as square or circular with concentric internal holes, is
   presented. The foundations are resting on a homogeneous, linear elastic
   halfspace and are subjected to external forces or seismic wave
   excitation. Both `relaxed' and `non-relaxed' boundary conditions at the
   interface between the foundation and the halfspace are considered, and
   several parametric studies are conducted to assess the influence of
   either type of boundary conditions upon each of the possible modes of
   vibration. Results for massive and massless foundations are presented in
   time and frequency domains for impulsive and harmonic excitations,
   respectively. A time domain boundary element method (BEM) developed by
   the authors for the solution of a class of 3-D soil-structure
   interaction (SSI) problems is used for all the analyses reported in this
   work. The accuracy and efficiency of the method and the BEM models
   developed in this work are assessed on the basis of comparison studies

Abstract = {{The paper presents a theory and a new generic computational model of a
   biologically plausible artificial neuron and artificial neural network
   (ANN) that can mimic certain brain neuronal ensembles, the dynamics of
   which is influenced by the dynamics of internal gene regulatory networks
   (GRN). We call these models ``computational neurogenetic models{''}
   (CNGM) and this new area of research-Computational Neurogenetics. We are
   aiming at developing a novel computational modelling paradigm and also
   at bringing original insights into how genes and their interactions
   influence the function of brain neural networks in normal and diseased
   states. Both brain activity and an ANN model can be analyzed using same
   signal processing techniques and then compared. In the proposed model,
   FFT and spectral characteristics of the ANN behavior are analyzed and
   compared with desired activity of the brain, measured as EEG signals.
   The model will include a large set of biologically plausible parameters
   and functions related to genes/proteins, spiking neuronal activities,
   etc., which define the GRN and the corresponding ANN. These parameters
   will be optimized, based for instance on targeted EEG data, through
   using evolutionary algorithms. The paper also offers a list of open
   questions in the field of CNGM. It outlines directions for further
   research, one of them being nanotechnology where specific models can be
   developed based on our approach before any medical intervention at a
   molecular level can be administered to patients suffering of different
   brain diseases.}},

   investigate the association of Trp64Arg polymorphism of the beta 3
   adrenergic receptor gene with overweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus in
   polish subjects. The Trp64Arg polymorphism was determined by PCR-based
   MspI restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The study
   population consisted of 358 subjects, among whom 200 were diagnosed as
   overweight (BMI > 27 kg/m(2)). Among overweight subjects 111 presented
   with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 89 with normal glucose metabolism. All
   study participants were unrelated Caucasians and inhabited the city of

Volume = {{139}},

Abstract = {{Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play pivotal roles in
   plant innate immunity. Overexpression of StMEK1(DD), a constitutively
   active MAPK kinase that activates salicylic acid-induced protein kinase
   (SIPK) and wound-induced protein kinase (WIPK), provokes hypersensitive
   response-like cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana. Here we purified a
   51-kD MAPK, which was activated in potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers
   treated with hyphal wall elicitor of a plant pathogen, and isolated the
   cDNA designated StMPK1. The deduced amino acid sequence of the StMPK1
   showed strong similarity to stress-responsive MAPKs, such as tobacco
   (Nicotiana tabacum) SIPK and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtMPK6.
   To investigate the downstream signaling of StMPK1, we identified several
   proteins phosphorylated by StMPK1 (PPSs) using an in vitro expression
   cloning method. To dissect the biological function of PPSs in the plant
   defense, we employed virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in N.
   benthamiana. VIGS of NbPPS3 significantly delayed cell death induced by
   the transient expression of StMEK1(DD) and treatment with hyphal wall
   elicitor. Furthermore, the mobility shift of NbPPS3 on
   SDS-polyacrylamide gel was induced by transient expression of
   StMEK1(DD). The mobility shift of NbPPS3 induced by StMEK1(DD) was not
   compromised by VIGS of WIPK or SIPK alone, but drastically reduced by
   the silencing of both WIPK and SIPK. This work strongly supports the
   idea that PPS3 is a physiological substrate of StMPK1 and is involved in
   cell death activated by a MAPK cascade.}},

Abstract = {{An 18-year-old girl was found dead in her bed. The autopsy revealed a
   colloid cyst of the third ventricle. The cyst obstructed the flow of
   cerebrospinal fluid, leading to prominent internal hydrocephalus with
   consecutive brain edema and compression of the caudal medulla at the
   foramen magnum. The girl's only previous complaints were episodic
   headaches for the previous 23 years. Computed tomography and magnetic
   resonance imaging were not performed prior to her death.
   This case report highlights the importance of early diagnosis of colloid
   cyst of the third ventricle and the need to perform computed tomography
   and magnetic resonance imaging in patients with episodic headaches even
   when they show no neurologic deficit. Although it is a very rare
   disorder it should be included in the differential diagnosis of
   headaches in children and young adults, and also in the differential
   diagnosis of conditions causing increased intracranial pressure, in view
   of the life-saving management required to prevent a fatal outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed hematopoietic chimerism induced via nonmyeloablative bone marrow
   transplantation (BMT) leads to unresponsiveness of anti-Gal alpha 1,3Gal
   beta 1,4G1cNAc (Gal) natural antibody (NAb)-producing cells in alpha
   1,3-galactosyltransferase deficient (GalT(-/-)) mice. We analyzed the
   mechanisms of anti-Gal-producing B cell unresponsiveness induced by
   Gal(+/+) BMT. C57BL/6 (B6) GalT(-/-) mice received 3Gy whole-body
   irradiation and BMT from B6-CD45 congenic mice. BMT led to marked
   reductions in serum anti-Gal IgM levels and in the numbers of splenic
   anti-Gal-producing cells by 2 weeks post-BMT. B cells with anti-Gal Ig
   receptors were present in the spleens of 2-week but not 12-week
   chimeras. In vitro studies and adoptive transfer studies using B6
   GalT(-/-)B cell-deficient recipients showed that B cell
   hyporesponsiveness to Gal at 2 weeks, but not 12 weeks, depended on
   persistent Gal antigen. Thus, pre-existing B-1 cells are anergic when
   there is continuous exposure to Gal, whereas long-term unresponsiveness
   does not require persistent antigen, implicating clonal deletion and/or
   receptor editing. These results have implications for the potential use
   of mixed hematopioetic chimerism as an approach to performing organ
   transplantation in recipients with pre-existing anti-donor IgM
   antibodies.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to experimentally establish thermal
   energy storage (TES) performance using a technical grade paraffin wax as
   a phase change material (PCM) in a vertical concentric pipe-in-pipe
   latent heat storage system. The melting and solidification temperature
   range of the paraffin was found as 38 degrees C-43 degrees C and 36
   degrees C-42 degrees C, respectively. These values were well in
   agreement with the values measured by differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) analysis. The inlet temperature and mass flow rate of the heat
   transfer fluid (HTF) were selected as experimental parameters. The
   radial and axial temperature distributions were determined during the
   heat charging and discharging processes of the PCM. The temporal
   temperature data showed that the relevant experimental parameters were
   more effective on the melting time than on the solidification time due
   to increased natural convection during the melting process. Furthermore,
   heat fraction during the charging and discharging processes of the PCM
   were established. Experimental results indicated that the heat charging
   fraction was affected by change in the relevant experimental parameters
   more during the heat charging than discharging processes of the PCM.
   Finally, it was concluded from the results that the investigated
   technical grade paraffin wax encapsulated in the annulus of the two
   vertical cylindrical pipes had good thermal energy storage performance
   and it is a suitable latent heat storage material for passive solar
   thermal energy storage applications.}},

Abstract = {{Through a feminist agenda that seeks to redress gender inequities
   through remedies of redistribution and recognition, this paper draws on
   Fraser's work ( 1997) to articulate a framework of transformative

   remedies, this framework adopts a transformative theory and politics in
   problematising and seeking to restructure the inequitable gender
   differentiation of political-economic structures and social patterns of
   representation, interpretation and communication. This framework of
   gender justice is presented as useful in evaluating the ideologies and
   practices of particular schooling initiatives and thus is drawn on to
   critically assess three initiatives that currently seek to address
   issues of social/gender equity in education within Australia: The New
   Basics Project, The Productive Pedagogies Framework and the Success for
   Boys initiative. In particular, the paper critically explores these
   initiatives in terms of their capacities for enabling or constraining a

Abstract = {{ClpB and DnaK form a bi-chaperone system that reactivates strongly
   aggregated proteins in vivo and in vitro. Previously observed
   interaction between purified ClpB and DnaK suggested that one of the
   chaperones might recruit its partner during substrate reactivation. We
   show that ClpB from Escherichia coli binds at the substrate binding site
   of DnaK and the interaction is supported by the N-terminal domain and
   the middle domain of ClpB. Moreover, the interaction between ClpB and
   DnaK depends on the nucleotide-state of DnaK: it is stimulated by ADP
   and inhibited by ATP. These observations indicate that DnaK recognizes
   selected structural motifs in ClpB as ``pseudo-substrates{''} and that
   ClpB may compete with bona fide Substrates of DnaK. We conclude that
   direct interaction between ClpB and DnaK does not mediate a substrate
   transfer between the chaperones, it may, however, play a role in the
   recruitment of the bi-chaperone system to specific recognition sites in
   aggregated particles. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   storytelling content and process to assess the extent to which families
   jointly integrated or fragmented a shared sense of identity and how

   study involving 58 family triads indicate relationships between story
   theme (e.g., accomplishment vs. stress), person referencing practices
   (e.g., we-ness vs. separateness), and interactional storytelling
   behaviors (e.g., engagement, turn-taking). Moreover, story framing,
   perspective-taking, statements about selves-in-the-family, and
   identifying as a ``storytelling family{''} emerged consistently as
   positive predictors of family satisfaction and functioning. The results
   offer a portrait of how families communicate identity and functioning in
   joint storytelling interactions and further position storytelling as a
   communication phenomenon worthy of consideration.}},

Abstract = {{We begin by briefly surveying and discussing approaches to the study of
   Russian foreign policy after the Cold War. These largely descriptive
   approaches fail to provide much purchase on the new circumstances
   obtaining after 9/11. Instead we consider the `war on terror' from a
   broadly constructivist perspective as a new international paradigm. We
   describe its main features, and then consider its implications for
   Russian-American relations in three policy areas: Chechnya, neighbouring
   states, and internal security. We find in these areas both opportunities
   and dilemmas for Russian foreign policy.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzed patients' accounts of how living with terminal
   illness affects their quality of life and their experiences of attending
   St. Christopher's Hospice, which operates a psychosocial model of day
   care. Thirty-four patients took part in six audiotape recorded
   ``goldfish bowl{''} teaching sessions for medical students. The tapes
   were transcribed and analyzed and the following themes were identified.
   Firstly, terminal illness causes multiple losses to quality of life;
   specific examples of physical limitations, loss of social interaction,
   low mood, and changed family dynamics were commonly experienced.
   Secondly, attending the day centre brought about beneficial changes.
   Patients described change of mood; enjoyment; achievement; sense of
   community, belonging, and mutual support; and were able to address
   problems with their relationships. It is concluded that attending day
   care improved these patients' quality of life. This study, which attends
   to patients' experiences of day care, builds on data acquired from
   studies using existing quality of life scales.}},

Abstract = {{The pathomorphological correlate of Kennedy's disease (KD) is a
   degeneration of spinal and bulbar alpha-motor neurons. The disease is
   caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the X-chromosomal
   androgene receptor gene. Contrary to the common belief that cognitive
   disorders in motor neuron diseases (MND) are either rare or only mild,
   there is now an increasing number of case reports on dementia in
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In ALS, dementia of the frontal
   lobe type ( frontotemporal dementia, FTD) seems to be the characteristic
   pattern. However, in KD cognitive dysfunction has not been studied
   systematically. Here we present a case with clinical characteristics of
   FTD in a patient with genetically confirmed KD. It remains speculative
   whether there is an association between KD and FTD comparable to a
   genetic linkage between ALS and FTD, which has been proposed in recent
   years. However, we suggest that cognitive dysfunction may be more common
   in KD than reported until today.}},

   strengthening. It also increases the resistance of grain boundaries to
   flow at high temperatures. Further increases of RE additions reduce
   strength and ductility due to growth of the Al11RE3 brittle phase, which
   has sharp edges. Still, at a 3 wt pct RE addition, the strength of the

Abstract = {{Although the megamitochondria (MM) were localized in various
   pathological conditions, normal retina of some mammalian species was
   reported to include MM for various physiological roles. However, it was
   not clearly confirmed whether the MM is present in the retina of lower
   vertebrate as well. In this study, we tried to show the presence of the
   MM in the zebrafish retina using electron microscopic technique. In all
   the photoreceptors including rods, cones and double cones of the
   zebrafish retina, MM were observed in the ellipsoid of inner segment. In
   the photoreceptor epllipsoid of the zebrafish retina, the mitochondria
   located in the central portion of the ellipsoid had a highly
   electron-dense matrix, which were accompanied by the mitochondria with
   electron-lucent matrix in the apical portion of the ellipsoid. The
   presence of MM was more clearly discernable in the rods, which were
   localized under the double cones. This finding is somewhat different
   from those observed in the previous studies because MM were localized in
   the inner segment of cones, but were not in those of rods in the case of
   mammalian retina. Although the exact physiological meaning for the
   presence of MM in some vertebrate species should be further studied, the
   present study could show that the MM in the ellipsoid of the retinal
   photoreceptors was not only restricted in some mammalian species.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of face recognition methods using subspace projection is
   directly related to the characteristics of their basis images,
   especially in the cases of local distortion or partial occlusion. In
   order for a subspace projection method to be robust to local distortion
   and partial occlusion, the basis images generated by the method should
   exhibit a part-based local representation. We propose an effective
   part-based local representation method named locally salient ICA
   (LS-ICA) method for face recognition that is robust to local distortion
   and partial occlusion. The LS-ICA method only employs locally salient
   information from important facial parts in order to maximize the benefit
   of applying the idea of ``recognition by parts.{''} It creates
   part-based local basis images by imposing additional localization
   constraint in the process of computing ICA architecture I basis images.
   We have contrasted the LS-ICA method with other part-based
   representations such as LNMF (Localized Nonnegative Matrix
   Factorization) and LFA (Local Feature Analysis). Experimental results
   show that the LS-ICA method performs better than PCA, ICA architecture
   I, ICA architecture II, LFA, and LNMF methods, especially in the cases
   of partial occlusions and local distortions.}},

Abstract = {{Cytogenetic maps of sorghum chromosomes 3-7, 9, and 10 were constructed

   quantified. Euchromatic DNA spans similar to 50\% of the sorghum genome,
   ranging from similar to 60\% of chromosome 1 (SBI-01) to similar to 33\%
   of chromosome 7 (SBI-07). This portion of the sorghum genome is
   predicted to encode similar to 70\% of the sorghum genes (similar to 1
   gene model/12.3 kbp), assuming that rice and sorghum en code a similar
   number of genes. Heterochromatin spans similar to 411 Mbp of the sorghum
   genome, a region characterized by a similar to 34-fold lower rate of

Abstract = {{Background Most of the evidence about socioeconomic inequalities in the
   metabolic syndrome comes from Western industrialized societies. The aim
   of this study is to examine how the inequalities appear and what could
   explain them in Korea, a rapidly changing society.
   Methods We analysed the nationwide survey data of 1998 and 2001 with a
   sample of 4630 men and 5896 women (>= 25 years). The subjects were
   grouped into four birth cohorts based on the historical context: born
   before 1946, 1946-53, 1954-62, and since 1963. Socioeconomic position
   was defined by education level: high school graduation or above as the
   more educated group, and below that as the less educated one. The
   syndrome was defined according to ATP III criteria using abdominal
   obesity for Asians. The covariates included family history of diabetes,
   smoking, drinking, daily physical activity, regular exercise, suicidal
   ideation, weight change, and carbohydrates intake. The associations were
   examined by stratified logistic regression models across cohorts and
   gender.
   Results Less-educated women had higher prevalence with widening gaps
   across successive cohorts; the age-adjusted odds ratios of the
   less-educated group were 1.22 (0.86-1.71), 1.41 (1.01-1.97), 2.50
   (1.87-3.35), and 2.64 (1.69-4.14). They hardly changed after covariate
   adjustment, and remained significant with considerable attenuation after
   controlling body mass index. However, educational disparities were not
   observed in men.
   Conclusions We could observe the complex pattern of disparities in the
   metabolic syndrome across cohorts and gender. An equity-sensitive health
   promotion programme to prevent further spread of social inequalities may
   have beneficial effects on the metabolic syndrome and its components in
   Korea.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a musical composition and performing method for the dynamic

   as well as Cakewalk 9.0, Goldwave 5.0, and Windows Media Player. The
   music score included four lines, one representing sensory data and three
   reflecting three layers of human consciousness. Different time units
   were applied by incorporating different repetition cycles for the
   relevant consciousness layers. The musical scores of individual subjects
   differed in terms of the score pattern and its sound. The music
   representing food taste was played by four instruments and showed
   different sound and acoustic frequency patterns for each individual
   subject during the consumption of potato chips. The musical expression
   method was applied to analyze the individual taste characteristics in
   the cognition of food.}},

Abstract = {{The immediate-type allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is involved in many
   allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and sinusitis. We
   investigated the effect of the gall of Rhus javanica (GRJ) on the model
   of the immediate-type allergic reaction, and studied its possible
   mechanisms. GRJ inhibited compound 48/80-induced systemic reactions in
   mice. GRJ attenuated immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated local allergic
   reactions. In addition, GRJ dose dependently decreased histamine release
   from rat peritoneal mast cells activated by compound 48/80 or IgE. The
   decreasing effect of GRJ on the histamine release was mediated by the
   modulation of cAMP and {[}Ca2+]i in mast cells. Furthermore, GRJ
   decreased the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore
   A23187-stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion in human mast cells. The
   inhibitory effect of GRJ on the pro-inflammatory cytokine was c-Jun
   N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B dependent. Our findings
   provide evidence that GRJ inhibits mast cell-derived immediate-type
   allergic reactions, and suggest the possible mechanisms of action. (c)

Abstract = {{The incidence of latex allergy is increasing in Japanese adults.
   However, the changing incidence of latex allergy in children with or
   without allergic diseases has not been reported in detail.
   After obtaining written informed consent from parents, Japanese children
   under 14 years of age were studied. In total, 776 non-atopic children,
   802 children with allergic rhinitis (AR), 706 children with bronchial
   asthma (BA) and 844 children with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome
   (AEDS) were asked about symptoms of latex allergy, and tested by serum
   latex-specific IgE, skin prick test to latex allergen and
   latex-glove-wearing test between 2001 and 2003. All the patients were
   outpatients at Ujitakeda Hospital, white the non-atopic children were
   children of the staff of Ujitakeda Hospital or Unitika Ltd. This was a
   retrospective study. The incidence of latex allergy in 2001/2002/2003
   was 1.4/3.1/4.7\% in non-atopic children, 3.1/5.1/9.1\% in AR patients,
   3.6/6.5/10.3\% in BA patients and 6.1/11.3/15.9\% in AEDS patients,
   respectively. Moreover, although no cases of anaphytactic shock were
   noted in allergic patients in 2001, two and eight cases were noted in
   2002 and 2003, respectively.
   These results indicate that the incidence of latex allergy is increasing
   in paediatric patients with allergic diseases. A latex-reduced
   environment may be desirable in future. (c) 2005 The Royal Institute of

Abstract = {{Direct repair of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) results in
   synkinesis and compromised laryngeal function. We have therefore
   developed a pig model to investigate whether anastomosis of the phrenic
   nerve with the abductor branch of the RLN leads to specific
   reinnervation of abductor muscles. Expression of myosin heavy chain
   protein (MyHC), a marker of appropriate reinnervation, was determined in
   the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) abductor and thyroarytenoid (TA)
   adductor muscles following nerve injury and repair. The denervated PCA
   muscle exhibited decreased levels of the fast-type MyHC isoforms IIA and
   IIB, and increased slow-type MyHC expression. Similarly, there was a
   fall in type IIB levels in the denervated TA muscle but increases in
   both IIA and slow MyHC. Four months after repair, the MyHC expression in
   the PCA was near normal, suggesting that our model reduces the risk of
   synkinesis and ensures the accurate muscle reinnervation required for

Abstract = {{Background/Purpose: Ischemic reperfusion injury (IRA) should be minimum
   for the success of small bowel transplantation (SBTx). This Study
   investigated whether preoperative administration of neuropeptide
   bombesin (BBS) had a protective effect against IRA and subsequent acute
   rejection.
   Methods: Allogenic SBTx was performed heterotopically in rats (n = 18).
   All rats were administered FK506 (0.32 mg/kg per day) everyday. The rats
   were divided into 3 groups of 6 rats each: group 1, BBS(-)5: warm
   ischemic time (WIT), 5 minutes without BBS; group 2, BBS(-) 15: WIT, 15
   minutes without BBS; group 3, BBS(+)15: WIT, 15 minutes with BBS. The
   specimens were obtained from the stoma site at 1 hour after reperfusion
   and on postoperative day (POD) 1 and 7. The graft mucosal state and
   degree of acute rejection were evaluated by H\&E staining. The apoptotic
   cells in the crypt lesion was evaluated using terminal deoxynucleotidyl
   transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling immunohistochemistry.
   Apoptotic index (AI) was calculated for quantitative analysis.
   Results: H\&E staining revealed that the mucosal villi on POD I remained
   shortened in the BBS(-)15 group than in the other two groups. One hour
   after reperfusion, the AI in the BBS(-)15 group was 145.0\% +/- 37.2\%,
   which was significantly higher (P < .05) than in the BBS(-)5 group
   (32.6\% +/- 5.0\%) or the BBS(+)15 group (32.0\% +/- 3.0\%). On POD 7,
   the AI in the BBS(-)15 group was 63.7\% + +/- 5.03\%, which was
   significantly hi-her (P < .05) than in the BBS(-)5 (17.3\% +/- 4.6\%) or
   the BBS(+) 15 group (12.3\% +/- 3.06\%).
   Conclusions: Even a short WIT of 15 minutes induced considerable
   allograft mucosal damage, which also worsened acute rejection. Exogenous
   BBS Could prevent mucosal damage by IR/I and was also beneficial for the
   prevention of acute rejection. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The concept of the objet petit a is central to Lacan's theory of desire,
   which arguably represents his major contribution to psychoanalysis. It
   is an expression of the lack inherent in human beings, whose
   incompleteness and early helplessness produce a quest for fulfillment
   beyond the satisfaction of biological needs. The objet petit a is a
   fantasy that functions as the cause of desire; as such, it determines
   whether desire will be expressed within the limits of the pleasure
   principle or ``beyond,{''} in pursuit of an unlimited jouissance, an
   impossible and even deadly enjoyment. Parallels between the objet petit
   a and Winnicott's transitional object are explored and its functions
   illustrated through analysis of Pedro Almodovar's film Talk to Her. A
   clinical case is presented in which the question of desire seemed
   crucial.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater treatment performance of the combined process of sequencing
   batch reactor (SBR) and mesh filtration bio-reactor was investigated
   with a synthetic wastewater. In this system, the filtration was
   performed only by the water level difference between the reactor and the
   effluent port, with the help of a sludge layer which accumulated on the
   mesh filter.
   A half volume of the mixed liquor was filtrated for ca. 1 h, and the
   filtration time was not affected by the initial pressure within the
   range of 0.5-2.0 m-H2O. Since the mesh filter could effectively reject
   the biomasses in the reactor, the effluents contained SS of less than 1
   mg/L and BOD of less than 10 mg/L under continuous or intermittent
   aeration conditions. Nitrogen was also removed effectively with the
   adjustment of aeration time under the intermittent aeration conditions.
   The results obtained in this work indicate that mesh filtration could be
   effectively combined with SBR and improve the performance of SBR.
   In addition, it was shown that the performance of the mesh filtration
   such as filtration time and solids separation was influenced
   significantly by the saccharide content in the exocellular polymer of
   the activated sludge. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   and photons in two central spectrometer arms, each of which covers 90
   degrees in azimuth and 0.35 units of rapidity. Further progress requires
   extending rapidity coverage for hadronic and electromagnetic signatures
   by upgrading the functionality of the PHENIX muon spectrometers to
   include photon and jet measurement capabilities. Tungsten calorimeters

Abstract = {{The electronic absorption and fluorescence spectra of 2-aminopyrimidine
   (2APM), 2-amino-4-methylpyrimidine (2A4MPM), and
   2-amino4,6-dimethylpyrimidine (2ADMPM) with acetic acid (AcOH) were
   measured in isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) at room temperature. From
   the absorption spectra, a hydrogen-bonded complex formation of the
   2APM/AcOH, 2A4MPM/AcOH, and 2ADMPM/AcOH systems was recognized in
   isooctane. The enthalpy changes (-Delta H) for the complex formation
   were estimated to be ca. 41.2-45.1 kJ mol(-1) and increased in
   proportion to the numbers of the methyl group introduced into the 2APM.
   The -Delta H values refer to the formation of the hydrogen-bonded 1: 1
   complex between the ring nitrogen atom and NH2 group of the
   aminopyrimidine and the OH and C=O groups of AcOH, respectively. In the
   2A4MPM/AcOH double hydrogen-bonded complex the CH group of AcOH is
   thought to be linked to the ring nitrogen at the 1-postion of 2A4MPM.
   The fluorescence spectral results indicate that the double proton
   transfer reaction takes place during the excited state, and gives rise
   to an imino-tautomer vibration emission, from analogy with the
   fluorescences of 1-methyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinimine (MPMI),
   1,4-dimethyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinimine (DMPMI), and
   1,4,6-trimethyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinimine (TMPMI). The fluorescence quantum
   yields of the imino-tautomers also increased in proportion to the
   numbers of the methyl group introduced into the 2APM. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Role of microstructure on interfacial crack growth in particulate
   bimaterials made of glass particle reinforced epoxy is examined
   experimentally. Two types of bimaterials, one with a discrete jump in
   mean filler particle size across the interface and the other with two
   intermixed particle sizes in the interfacial region, are studied. The
   choice of particle sizes used in bimaterials is based on a set of
   experiments in which particle size effects on fracture behavior of
   monolithic specimens with single particle size are established using
   optical interferometry and high-speed photography. A non-monotonic
   steady state stress intensity factor (K-Iss) variation with mean
   particle size is observed in the size range of 7-203 mu m for 10\%
   volume fraction. Among the selected particles sizes, 35 mu m mean
   diameter is found to produce the highest K-Iss, Increasing or decreasing
   particle size results in measurable reduction in K-Iss of the composite.
   Based on this result, discrete and diffuse bimaterials made of 35 pm and
   203 mu m diameter filler particles are studied. The K-Iss of the diffuse
   interface with intermixed particle sizes is bounded by the ones for
   monolithic configurations with single size particles. Further, K-Iss
   appears to vary linearly with the volume fraction of particle size
   having lower K-Iss in monolithic configurations. On the contrary, in
   case of a microstructurally discrete interface, the measured K-Iss is
   same as the one for the weaker half of the bimaterial. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   Responsibility Center for the period 1990-2000, we find that
   antitakeover governance provisions lower the cost of debt financing.
   Segmenting the data into firms with the strongest management rights
   (strongest antitakeover provisions) and firms with the strongest
   shareholder rights (weakest antitakeover provisions), we find that
   strong antitakeover provisions are associated with a lower cost of debt
   financing while weak antitakeover provisions are associated with a
   higher cost of debt financing, with a difference of about 34 basis
   points between the two groups. Overall, the results suggest that
   antitakeover governance provisions, although not beneficial to
   stockholders, are viewed favorably in the bond market.}},

Abstract = {{Compression and wire-cutting experiments on dispersions of fully
   hydrogenated palm oil in sunflower oil with varying fraction solid fat
   were carried out to establish which parameters are important for the
   large deformation behavior of fat crystal networks. Compression
   experiments showed that the apparent Young's modulus, yield stress,
   yield deformation and Bingham extensional viscosity scaled with the
   volume fraction solid fat according a power law. For the Young's modulus
   and yield stress, the exponent was about 3.8-3.9. The scaling exponent
   is close to the one relating the storage modulus and the fraction solid
   fat at deformations within the linear region. The specific fracture
   energy obtained from wire cutting also increased with volume fraction
   solid fat. That of a 10\% solid fat dispersion was about 4 J/m(2).
   Combination of the energy input from compression experiments and the
   specific fracture energies from wire-cutting experiments yielded defect
   lengths of the order of 20 mu m. This length scale corresponds to the
   size of a fat crystal aggregate at the gel point.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate identification of interactions of reactive solutes with porous
   media constituents is necessary for reliable risk assessment studies and
   the development of efficient sanitation strategies. Standard parameter
   estimation procedures bear a number of unsolved problems with respect to
   uniqueness and identifiability. This paper presents a new approach for
   the identification of nonlinear interaction parameters of column outflow
   experiments. The procedure requires no a priori assumptions on the shape
   of the underlying interaction process functions. Employing experimental
   data sets on cadmium and anthracene breakthrough as case studies,
   possible applications of the new approach will be shown, and its
   features will be discussed. Error analysis based on singular value
   decomposition of the sensitivity matrix quantifies the identification
   error. Identification procedures without a priori shape information are
   superior to fixed parametrizations in diagnostic investigations,
   especially in cases without reliable a priori knowledge on the sorptive
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of commercially available pressure monitors were
   evaluated. The pressure range of these pressure monitors is up to 100
   MPa and the resolution of the transducer is 0.1 kPa. The pressure
   monitor includes a quartz Bourdon-type high-precision electronic
   pressure transducer inside the body. The sensing element of the
   transducer is a precision quartz crystal resonator and the frequency of
   oscillation varies with pressure-induced stress. In total, six pressure
   monitors were prepared for this study. During 15 months, the six
   monitors were calibrated simultaneously using a hydraulic pressure
   balance I I times in total. The effects on the readings of the monitors
   by setting parameters and environmental conditions were evaluated. The
   important characteristics for the pressure transducer such as the
   temperature coefficient of the span reading and long-term stability were
   also evaluated quantitatively. From the evaluation results, the
   behaviours of the transducers during the period were well characterized.
   The standard deviation of the relative deviations from the least-squares
   best-fitting function for each pressure transducer was less than 6 x
   10(-6) in the pressure range of 30 MPa to 100 MPa and had a maximum of
   11 x 10(-6) at 10 MPa. In this article, the details of the

Abstract = {{Phytoremediation is an innovative technology that utilizes the natural
   properties of plants to remediate hazardous waste sites. For more
   cost-effective phytoremediation, it is important to utilize a
   hyperaccumulating plant after phytoremediation, i.e. the recovery of
   valuable metals and the production of useful materials. In this work,
   the determination of metals in plant component polymers in a fern,
   Athyrium yokoscense, as a hyper-accumulating plant was established using
   steam explosion, Wayman's extraction method, and ICP emission
   spectrometry. After A. yokoscense plants were treated by steam
   explosion, the steam-exploded A. yokoscense were separated into four
   plant component polymers, i.e. water-soluble material fraction,
   holocellulose fraction, methanol-soluble lignin fraction, and residual
   lignin fraction. The concentrations of Cu, Ph, Fe, and Zn in these plant
   component polymers and the dry weights of plant component polymers were
   measured. These analytical process determining metals in the plants will
   contribute to not only the evaluation and the efforts of
   phytoremediation using a hyperaccumulating plant, but also to the
   development of more effective phytoremediation.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear localization of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
   is implicated in the process of apoptosis. To study the function of
   GAPDH, we expressed GAPDH C-terminally fused with or without nuclear
   localization signal (NLS) in SH-SY5Y and NB41A3 cells using a retrovirus
   expression system. GAPDH carrying NLS (GAPDH-NLS) was expressed mainly
   in the nucleus. However, expression of GAPDH-NLS did not cause any
   difference in cell survival rate as compared to that of the vector alone
   or GAPDH without NLS. Treatment with 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-pyridium iodide
   (MPP+) caused no difference in the cell survival rate or in the pattern
   or extent of apoptosis among the three transductants. In the cells
   expressing GAPDH without NLS, MPP+ did not cause visible translocation
   of GAPDH into nucleus before the onset of apoptosis. Since GAPDH is
   known to comprise a CRM1-mediated nuclear export signal, we blocked the
   nuclear export of GAPDH by treatment with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of
   CRM1-mediated nuclear export. The treatment did not cause any difference
   in apoptosis among the three transductants. An additional treatment with
   MPP+ induced no apoptotic difference in these cells. Thus, we have
   concluded that a simple nuclear localization of GAPDH does not induce
   apoptosis, and that MPP+-induced apoptosis is not caused by nuclear
   translocation of GAPDH.}},

Abstract = {{We report on an investigation of the beam profile of an atom laser
   extracted from a magnetically trapped Rb-87 Bose-Einstein condensate.
   The transverse momentum distribution is magnified by a curved mirror for
   matter waves and a momentum resolution of 1/60 of a photon recoil is
   obtained. We find the transverse momentum distribution to be determined
   by the mean-field potential of the residing condensate, which leads to a
   nonsmooth transverse density distribution. Our experimental data are
   compared with a full three-dimensional simulation of the output coupling
   process and we find good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Because of insufficient imaging by maternal transabdominal fetal
   ecbocardiograpby (TAE) in a human fetus with aortic atresia, imperforate
   atrial septum and progressive cardiac failure, we assessed the
   feasibility of fetal transesopbageal ecbocardiograpby (TEE) as a
   monitoring tool during fetal cardiac intervention at 24 + 6 weeks of
   gestation. Percutaneous fetoscopic intraesophageal deployment of the
   ultrasound catheter was achieved and did not result in any maternal or
   fetal complications. Fetal TEE permitted substantially clearer
   definition of fetal cardiac anatomy and intracardiac device
   manipulations than conventional maternal TAE. Despite the employment of
   various devices, no sufficiently large opening could be achieved within
   the atrial septum. Although the fetus tolerated the procedure remarkably
   well and satisfactory fetoplacental flow could be documented at the end
   of the procedure, the fetus died from progressive cardiac failure 3 days
   after the intervention. Fetoscopic TEE is feasible in the human fetus
   and permits substantially clearer definition of fetal cardiac anatomy
   and intracardiac manipulations than conventional maternal TAE. Based on
   the observation of spontaneous closure of multiple iatrogenic
   perforations of the atrial septum, specialized devices are required in
   order to improve the technical success rate of septoplasty methods and
   hence the survival odds of these high-risk patients. Copyright (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Synapses between taste receptor cells and primary sensory afferent
   fibers transmit the output signal from taste buds to the central nervous
   system. The synaptic vesicle cycle at the synapses involves vesicle
   docking, priming, fusion, endocytosis, and recycling. Many kinds of
   synaptic vesicle proteins participate in synaptic vesicle cycles. One of
   these, synaptotagmin 1, binds Ca2+ phospholipids with high affinity and
   plays a role in Ca2+ regulated neurotransmitter release in the central
   and peripheral nervous systems. However, the expression patterns of
   synaptotagmin 1 in rat taste tissues have not been determined. We
   therefore examined the expression patterns of synaptotagmin 1 and
   several cell specific markers of type II and III cells in rat taste
   buds. RT-PCR assay showed that synaptotagmin I mRNA was expressed in
   circumvallate papillae. In fungiform, foliate, and circumvallate
   papillae, the antibody against synaptotagmin 1 yielded the labeling of a
   subset of taste bud cells and intra- and subgemmal nerve processes.
   Double labeled experiments showed that synaptotagmin 1 positive cells
   co-expressed type III cell markers, PGP 9.5, and NCAM. Intragemmal nerve
   processes positive for synaptotagmin 1 co-expressed PGP 9.5. Conversely,
   all synaptotagmin 1 expressing cells did not co-expresse type II cell
   markers, PLC beta 2, or gustducin. These results show that synaptotagmin
   I may play some regulatory roles in vesicle membrane fusion events with
   the plasma membrane at the synapses of type III cells in rat taste buds.}},

Abstract = {{The development and growth of a feather star Decametra tigrina front
   Notojima Island Japan, is reported. This is the first record describing
   the complete development, front early embryos to juveniles, in the
   family Colobometridae. Their larval development was observed to progress
   independently from the adults, and was similar to other feather star
   species. Embryos hatched as uniformly ciliated gastrulae, Which turned
   into doliolaria larvae when four narrow circumferential ciliated bands
   were formed. Skeletal ossicles began to form inside the doliolaria
   larvae, which subsequently settled to the substrate, proceeding to the
   cystidean stage. The prostrusion of the arms from the oral opening
   marked the beginning of the pentacrinold stage. About 45 days after
   hatching, they autotomized their stalks and became juvenile comatulids
   with arms about 6 trim long. early juveniles apparently differ from the
   adults in morphological characters, Such as having no pairs of tubercles
   or spines on the dorsal of their cirrals, and 110 proximal pinnules
   except for the first pinnule (P-1). Both features are prominent in
   adults and are used for the classification of D. tigrina. Morphological
   differences between juveniles and the adults may also Occur in other
   feather star species. A revision of the classification of comatulids,
   which considers morphological changes With growth, is required.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcoholic liver
   disease (ALD) are extremely similar in the pathologic findings and
   pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the difference and
   similarity between these diseases.
   Methods: Twenty-six patients with NASH and 26 with ALD including 11 with
   alcoholic hepatitis underwent clinico-pathologic analysis. The visceral
   fat area and liver/spleen ratio, an index of the hepatic fat content,
   were evaluated with computed tomography. The hepatic iron deposit and
   oxidative stress induced-lipid peroxidation were estimated by Prussian
   blue staining and 3-nitrotyrosine staining, respectively.
   Results: The most prominent difference between NASH and ALD was the
   nutritional status, although elevation of AST/ALT ratio and gamma-GT is
   relatively characteristic of ALD. NASH was more frequently associated
   with diabetes mellitus as compared with ALD. The BMI and serum levels of
   total cholesterol and cholinesterase were higher in NASH than in ALD.
   Although the degree and distribution of fibrosis and necro-inflammatory
   reaction were similar in NASH and ALD, steatosis was more severe in NASH
   than in ALD. The liver/spleen ratio was lower and the visceral fat area
   was larger in NASH than in ALD, regardless of the coincidence of
   alcoholic hepatitis. Interestingly, the visceral fat area positively
   correlated with ALT and HOMA-IR in NASH, whereas these correlations were
   not observed in ALD. The hepatic iron deposit was less in NASH than in
   ALD, whereas lipid peroxidation in NASH was similar to that in ALD with
   alcoholic hepatitis and more advanced as compared with that in ALD
   without alcoholic hepatitis.
   Conclusions: NASH was characterized with over-nutrition and visceral fat
   type obesity as compared with ALD. The visceral fat accumulation was
   associated with hepatic inflammation and insulin resistance in NASH, but
   not in ALD. The difference in the nutritional status between NASH and
   ALD is not only reflected in the clinical features but also may closely
   associate with the mechanisms of hepatocellular damage in these
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The functional expression of the mouse Kir2.1 potassium channel in yeast
   cells lacking transport systems for potassium and sodium efflux (ena1-4
   Delta nha1 Delta) resulted in increased cell sensitivity to high
   external concentrations of potassium. The phenotype depended on the
   level of Kir2.1 expression and on the external pH. The activity of
   Kir2.1p in the yeast cells was almost negligible at pH 3.0 and the
   highest at pH 7.0. Kir2.1p was permeable for both potassium and rubidium
   cations, but neither sodium nor lithium were transported via the
   channel. Measurements of the cation contents in cells confirmed the
   higher concentration of potassium in cells with Kir2.1p. Specific
   inhibition of the mKir2.1 channel activity by Ba2+ cations was observed.
   The use of a mutant strain lacking both potassium efflux and uptake
   transporters (ena1-4 Delta nha1 Delta trk1 Delta trk2 Delta) enabled the
   monitoring of channel activity on two levels - the provision of the
   necessary amount of intracellular K+ in media with low potassium
   concentrations, and simultaneously, the channel's contribution to cell
   potassium sensitivity in the presence of high external K+. This
   combination of mutations proved to be a new, sensitive and practical
   tool for characterizing the properties of heterologously expressed
   transporters mediating both the efflux and influx of
   alkali-metal-cations. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   reduction processes of nickel. These solutions are relatively
   concentrated, and the temperature for solution preparation and reduction
   stages might range from room temperature up to 180-200 degrees C.
   Temperature has a great effect on solution equilibria and the
   equilibrium solubility of simple and complex crystalline salts such as
   sulphates and hydroxides known to exist in the system. In this work, the
   role of kinetics is recognized, but only equilibrium phenomena
   reconsidered. The main focus of the study was on the modeling of salt
   solubility. In cases of a process solution where the precipitation of
   solid crystalline salts is highly undesirable it is important to know
   the safe limits for a `clear solution' to operate even if the kinetics
   are unfavorable. Relatively concentrated solutions are strongly
   non-ideal and realistic calculations on solution equilibria necessitate
   the modeling of excess thermodynamic properties of these solutions. The
   excess model selected for aqueous species was Pitzer's ion-interaction
   model and for the gas phase Tsonopoulos' model. Emphasis in data
   assessment was on the thermodynamic modeling of various binaries and
   ternaries to create a substantial database for the approximation of the
   quaternary system.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional energy band simulation has been performed in order to
   understand chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) diamond surface conductivity.
   It was found that the presence of shallow-level acceptors in the
   subsurface region and defect states at the surface causes a steep rise
   in the valence band toward the Fermi level, which causes accumulation of
   holes in the valence band in the subsurface and near-surface regions. An
   artificial negative charge accumulation (NCA) layer is introduced in the
   simulation to examine the effect of possible negatively charged
   adsorbates on surface conductivity. By adjusting the thickness of NCA
   layers, we have reproduced quantitatively both the surface conductivity
   change and Fermi-level change found in previous experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In 1985, Paterson and Bettger found hypoplastic hematopoiesis in

   -Zn), iron-deficient group (30 mg zinc/kg, no supplemental iron; -Fe),
   zinc/ iron-deficient group (4.5 mg zinc/kg, no supplemental iron;
   -Zn-Fe), and control group (AIN-93G; Cont). Water intake determined at d
   19 was similar among all treatment groups. At d 27-28, bioimpedance was
   measured. The intracellular water/extracellular water ratio was
   significantly increased in the -Zn group (p < 0.05). Compared to the
   Cont, group, the plasma crythropoietin concentration was increased by
   iron deficiency and decreased by zinc deficiency (p < 0.01). Hematocrit
   was significantly decreased in both the -Fe and -Zn-Fe groups and was
   significantly increased in the -Zn group (p < 0.01). Transferrin
   saturation in the -Fe and -Zn-Fe groups was significantly lower than the
   Cont group (p < 0.01), and that of the -Zn group was highest among all

Abstract = {{Aminoglycoside antibiotics, commonly prescribed for adults and children
   to treat a wide range of bacterial infections, are potentially ototoxic,
   often causing irreversible damage to the auditory and vestibular
   systems. Ototoxic hearing loss usually begins at the higher frequencies
   and can progress to lower frequencies necessary for understanding
   speech. Individual susceptibility to aminoglycoside ototoxicity is
   determined by multiple physiologic and genetic factors. Children are
   especially vulnerable to ototoxic-induced damage, which can affect
   speech and language development even when limited to the high
   frequencies. Monitoring hearing loss during and after treatment by
   conventional and ultra-high frequency audiometry allows early detection
   of ototoxic hearing loss. Objective measures such as auditory brainstem
   responses (ABRs) and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) can provide
   information about auditory function for individuals unable to provide
   reliable behavioral data, including young children. Early detection and
   subsequent alteration of treatment, as well as the potential future use
   of otoprotectants, may minimize or prevent ototoxic hearing loss.}},

Abstract = {{Obscurin (similar to 800 kDa) is the third member of a family of giant
   proteins expressed in vertebrate striated muscle, along with titin
   (3-3.7 MDa) and nebulin (similar to 800 kDa). Like its predecessors, it
   is a multidomain protein composed of tandem adhesion modules and
   signaling domains. Unlike titin and nebulin, which are integral
   components of sarcomeres, obscurin is concentrated at the peripheries of
   Z-disks and M-lines, where it is appropriately positioned to communicate
   with the surrounding myoplasm. This unique distribution allows obscurin
   to bind small ankyrin 1, an integral component of the sarcoplasmic
   reticulum (SR) membrane. Obscurin also associates with the contractile
   apparatus through its binding to titin, sarcomeric myosin and perhaps
   other proteins of the contractile apparatus. Overexpression of the
   COOH-terminus of obscurin in primary myotubes has a dramatic and
   specific effect on the organization of sarcomeric myosin, indicating a
   role in the organization and regular assembly of A-bands. Given its
   ability to associate tightly, selectively and periodically with the
   periphery of the myofibril, its high affinity for an integral membrane
   protein of the SR and its close association with thick filaments, we
   speculate that obscurin is ideally suited to play key roles in
   modulating the organization and assembly of both the myofibril and the
   SR.}},

Abstract = {{A consequence of isolation is increased susceptibility to catastrophe.
   Insect damage to fragmented and isolated forests has the potential to
   serve as a catastrophic force; such damage has increased worldwide due
   to climate change and fire suppression policies. We examined the
   response of endangered endemic Mt. Graham red squirrels to catastrophic
   insect damage due to moths, beetles, and introduced aphids. Insects
   changed the forest environment significantly for the endemic squirrel by
   reducing basal area and stem densities of live stems, while increasing
   number and basal area of standing dead stems. Availability of two major
   foods, fungi and tree seeds, declined in insect-damaged forests relative
   to trends in undamaged forests. Numbers of Mt. Graham red squirrels
   declined precipitously in insect-damaged forests suggesting a
   catastrophe. Conservation options are limited in such situations.
   Forest-insect induced catastrophes are likely to become more common in
   the near future as forest health declines due to past management tactics
   and climate change. Prudent conservation measures include the
   anticipation of insect outbreaks and effective forest treatments to
   decrease likelihood of such catastrophes to species of precarious,
   conservation status, while avoiding abrupt changes to critical habitat.

Abstract = {{Objective: The study aimed to answer the following questions: Are there
   any rural-urban differences in mental health once sociodemographic
   variables are controlled for, and are any of these differences observed
   in EU countries? Did the individuals suffering from mental health
   disorders have the same characteristics in rural and urban areas,
   particularly concerning self-reported impairment?
   Method: The European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders
   (ESEMeD 2000 study) is a cross-sectional, in-person, household interview
   survey based on probability samples representative of the adult
   population of 6 European countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the
   Netherlands, and Spain. The rural population is defined as those living
   in towns with fewer than 10 000 inhabitants, and the urban population is
   defined as those living in towns or cities with 10 000 or more
   inhabitants. A stratified, multistage, random sample without replacement
   was drawn in each country. The overall response rate of the study was
   about 61.2\% (weighted response rate).
   Results: The study results confirmed previous findings on the variation
   in mood disorders between rural and urban areas. Overall, urbanicity
   seemed to be linked to a higher risk of mental health disorders,
   particularly depressive disorders, whereas the link to anxiety disorders
   was only moderate and there was no link at all to alcohol disorders.
   Country differences concerned male respondents and not female
   respondents, with the exception of Belgium, where the differences
   concerned women only (and showed fewer disorders in rural areas).
   Conclusions: This study will, hopefully, stimulate further
   intra-European studies using comparable methods and instruments to look
   at the experience across the European continent and introduce steps to
   harmonize rural-urban population limits across diverse countries.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The neuropeptides leptin and ghrelin are involved in the
   appetite regulating network consisting of distinct orexigenic (ghrelin)
   and anorexigenic (leptin) circuitries. Recently, it has been shown that
   elevated leptin levels are associated with alcohol craving in patients
   suffering from alcoholism. Therefore, the aim of the present pilot study
   was to determine whether the gut-derived peptide ghrelin which increases
   hunger and food intake is altered and associated with alcohol craving in
   alcoholic patients
   Methods: Two types of alcoholic inpatients, group A (active drinker,
   acutely intoxicated, n = 97) and group B (early abstainer, who had
   stopped drinking 24-72 hrs before, n = 21) were consecutively included
   in a prospective study from the first day of hospitalization, Ghrelin
   plasma levels and craving data were assessed on days 0, 1, 2 and 7(-10)
   and compared to those of 24 healthy controls
   Results: At each time-point ghrelin plasma levels of alcoholic patients
   were significantly increased compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore,
   early abstainers showed significantly higher ghrelin levels than active
   drinkers. In the group of active drinkers ghrelin plasma levels were
   significantly increased at each time point compared to baseline. No
   correlations were found between ghrelin levels and craving data measured
   by the visual analogue scale or the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale
   Conclusions: Ghrelin-levels are elevated in alcoholism and seem to
   further increase during alcohol withdrawal. However, ghrelin levels do
   not seem to be associated with alcohol craving.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Because different tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)
   blockers may have distinct immunomodulatory effects on specific disease
   manifestations, the present study was carried out to investigate the
   immunomodulating effects of etanercept on peripheral synovitis in the
   spondylarthropathies (SpA).
   Methods. Peripheral joint disease was assessed clinically,
   histologically, and radiologically in a prospective 2-year study of 20
   patients with SpA treated with etanercept. Synovial tissue biopsy
   samples obtained at weeks 0,12, and 52 were analyzed by histology and
   immunohistochemistry for the extent of inflammation, changes to tissue
   architecture, and matrix degradation. Serum levels of myeloid-related
   protein 8 (MRP-8)/MRP-14, matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), and
   cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) were determined by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Results. Etanercept induced a rapid and sustained clinical improvement
   of peripheral joint disease. Histologic synovitis was down-regulated,
   with a profound reduction in global cellular infiltration and T
   lymphocytes, but not B lymphocytes. The most prominent change in markers
   of inflammation was a reduction in the different macrophage subsets
   (CD68, CD163, MRP-8, and MRP-14), but this was not paralleled by a
   decrease in serum MRP-8/MRP-14. Structural changes included
   normalization of lining layer hyperplasia and a moderate reduction in
   vascularity. However, no effect on the microarchitecture of lymphoid
   aggregates was observed. In terms of an effect on matrix degradation,
   the synovial expression of MMP-3 and MMP-9 was down-modulated in
   correlation with a rapid and profound decrease in serum MMP-3. At week
   52, serum COMP levels were also reduced. No significant radiologic
   disease progression was observed in these patients over a 2-year period.
   Conclusion. Use of etanercept effectively down-modulated the
   immunopathologic processes of SpA synovitis, both in the short term and
   in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiotoxicity is potentially the most threatening non-haematological
   side effect of high-dose CY. We prospectively evaluated the very acute
   cardiac effects of high-dose CY in 17 adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)
   patients receiving CY 1500 mg/m(2)/day as a part of BEAC high-dose
   therapy (HDT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and plasma natriuretic
   peptide (NT-proBNP, NT-proANP) measurements were performed prior to HDT
   (d-7) and just after completing HDT (d-2). After the high-dose CY left
   atrial end-systolic area increased from 15.2 +/- 1.2 to 18.5 +/- 1.4
   cm(2) (P = 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic volume from 136.1 +/-
   12.3 to 156.6 +/- 11.1 cm(3) (P = 0.04) and left ventricular
   end-systolic volume from 67.4 +/- 7.8 to 75.3 +/- 7.1 cm(3) (P = 0.018).
   However, no significant change in left ventricular ejection fraction
   (LVEF) was observed. At the same time, plasma levels of NT-proBNP
   increased from 134.9 +/- 53.3 to 547.1 +/- 168.4 pmol/l (P = 0.003) and
   NT-proANP from 481.1 +/- 105.5 to 1056.6 +/- 193.1 pmol/l (P = 0.001),
   respectively. To conclude, high-dose CY results in very acute cardiac
   toxicity characterised by enlargement of the heart chambers in NHL
   patients previously treated with anthracyclines. This toxicity can be
   detected with increased concentrations of circulating natriuretic
   peptides but not with LVEF measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Bone disease occurring in multiple myeloma is usually evaluated using

   increased level of ICTP in 75 patients with MM compared to control group
   (8 persons) and patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (10
   persons). The level of ICTP was also higher in patients with more
   advanced bone disease and probably in higher stage of disease according

Abstract = {{Rationale and objective: Protein kinase C (PKC) modulation of ionotropic
   receptors is a common mechanism for regulation of channel function. The
   effects of PKC and phosphatase activation on native gamma-aminobutyric
   acid (GABA(A)) receptors in adult brain are unknown. Previous studies of
   recombinant GABA(A) receptors have provided evidence that PKC activation
   inhibits receptor function, whereas other studies suggest that PKC
   either increases or does not alter GABA(A) receptor function. The
   present study explored (a) the effects of PKC and phosphatase activity
   on GABA-mediated Cl-36(-) uptake in cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes
   and (b) the effect of PKC activity on muscimol-induced loss of righting
   reflex (LORR) in adult rats. Methods: GABA(A) receptor function in vitro
   was measured by muscimol-induced Cl-36(-) uptake into cerebral cortical
   synaptoneurosomes. The in vivo effect of PKC on GABA(A)-mediated
   function was measured by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of
   4-beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) or calphostin C followed by
   determination of muscimol-induced LORR. Results: Adenosine triphosphate
   (ATP) and PDBu produced a concentration-dependent and specific reduction
   in muscimol-stimulated Cl-36(-) uptake that was blocked by the PKC
   inhibitor calphostin C. Both adenosine diphosphate and 4 alpha PDBu were
   ineffective. Phosphatase inhibition produced similar inhibition of
   muscimol responses. Furthermore, i.c.v. administration of PDBu and
   calphostin C produced opposing effects on both the onset and the
   duration of muscimol-induced LORR in rats. Conclusions: The present
   study provides evidence that PKC activation reduces GABA(A) receptor
   function in native receptors both in vitro and in vivo. Phosphatase
   inhibitors decrease muscimol-mediated Cl- uptake in GABA(A) receptors
   demonstrating coordinated regulation of native receptors by PKC and
   phosphatases.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclic-nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are key players in
   the intracellular signaling pathways of the important human pathogen
   Trypanosoma cruzi. We report herein the identification of an unusual PDE
   from this protozoal organism. This enzyme, TcrPDEC, is a member of the
   class I PDEs, as determined from the presence of a characteristic
   signature sequence and from the conservation of a number of functionally
   important amino acid residues within its catalytic domain. Class I PDEs
   include a large number of PDEs from eukaryotes, among them all 11 human
   PDE families. Unusually for an enzyme of this class, TcrPDEC contains a
   FYVE-type domain in its N-terminal region, followed by two closely
   spaced coiled-coil domains. Its catalytic domain is located in the
   middle of the polypeptide chain, whereas all other class I enzymes
   contain their catalytic domains in their C-terminal parts. TcrPDEC can
   complement a PDE deficient yeast strain. Unexpectedly for a
   kinetoplastid PDE, TcrPDEC is a dual-specificity PDE that accepts both
   cAMP and cGMP as its substrates.}},

Abstract = {{We report two studies examining the prevalence of sexual dysfunction,
   and the role of psychological variables, including quality of life, on
   sexual activity in patients at the commencement of an outpatient
   cognitive-behavioural pain management programme. In Study 1, 151
   patients with non-cancer pain, predominantly of musculoskeletal origin,
   completed a range of standardised measures, including the Pain
   Disability Index, Beck Depression Inventory and Coping Strategies
   Questionnaire. Sexual dysfunction was common, and using stepwise
   multiple regression analysis was found to be more frequently reported by
   those with greater disability and depression, shorter pain duration, and
   infrequent use of coping self-statements. Study 2 was a pilot
   investigation of the impact of sexual dysfunction on quality of life (as
   measured by the WHOQOL-100) in a similar sample (n = 41). Although
   sexual dysfunction was again commonly reported, subjects perceived it
   had less importance in quality of life than did other factors. The
   combined results support the previously proposed notion of adaptation to
   the impact of chronic illness on sexual function. In conclusion, sexual
   dysfunction is common in this population and is predicted by
   psychological factors and pain duration. However, other issues impact
   more significantly on quality of life. Therapeutic approaches to sexual
   dysfunction in these patients might best be focused on improving
   psychological factors, particularly depression and coping skills. (c)

Abstract = {{In 1919, the Institut metapsychique international (IMI) held its first
   meeting in Paris. With their choice of a name, the founders made their
   intentions clear. By using the term metapsychique rather than the more
   common sciences psychiques, they indicated a departure from previous
   enterprises of such kind in France. By attaching the label international
   to it, they signified that this orientation was to affect not just
   French research on Psychical phenomena, but that of the whole community.
   This article tells the story of the first 12 years of the IMI in its
   attempts to impose a program of research and to incorporate Psychical
   phenomena into the scientific corpus in particular ways. The article
   ends in 1931 with a spectacular attempt by members of the IMI to
   dominate the international psychical research community. The failures of
   the IMI, both with Psychical researchers and the scientific community in
   general, are explained here in terms of characteristics of the institute
   and the field itself. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To compare the efficacy of meloxicam administered
   perioperatively with transdermal administration of fentanyl via a patch
   placed preoperatively in dogs undergoing orthopedic surgery.
   Design-Prospective study.
   Animals-16 dogs.
   Procedure-Unilateral or bilateral osteotomy of the tibia and fibula was
   surgically performed, and a uniplanar external distraction device was
   placed in each limb. Postoperative pain and lameness were assessed 24,
   48, and 72 hours after administration of the first of 3 doses of
   meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg {[}0.09 mg/lb], IV, given preoperatively, followed
   by 0.1 mg/kg {[}0.045 mg/lb], IV, after 24 hours, and 0.1 mg/kg, PO,
   after 48 hours) or preoperative placement of a transdermal fentanyl
   patch (50 mu g/h) left in place for 72 hours.
   Results-No significant differences in total pain scores were detected
   between groups. Mean +/- SID lameness scores assessed at 24 and 72 hours
   were lower in dogs in the meloxicam group than dogs in the fentanyl
   group. Lameness scores decreased with time in a similar manner in both
   treatment groups.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Perioperative administration of
   meloxicam or preoperative placement of a transdermal fentanyl patch
   provided effective and similar postoperative analgesia in dogs
   undergoing orthopedic surgery. However, because of its anti-inflammatory
   effects, treatment with meloxicam reduced the degree of lameness and
   resulted in rapid functional recovery of the limb.}},

Title = {{Measurement of prostate rotation during insertion of needles for

Journal = {{RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{318-323}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate
   whether prostate rotation due to needle insertion for prostate
   brachytherapy is predictable and if so, to quantify this rotation, and
   to see whether locking needles reduce the magnitude of prostate
   rotation.
   Patients and methods: The measurements are done at the beginning of the
   procedure for brachytherapy with a Foley catheter in situ. After a
   needle is inserted into the prostate, a 3D ultrasound scan is made. Then
   the seeds are delivered using RAPID Strands (Oncura), and the needle is
   withdrawn. A second 3D scan is made. The needle and seed positions are
   determined in these scans. To determine the rotation of the prostate,
   the angle between the needle and the seed trajectory is calculated.
   Results: The prostate rotations have been measured in 16 patients, eight
   without the use of locking needles and eight with locking needles. In
   total 62 needles were inserted. The maximum rotation was 13.8 degrees
   and occurred in the coronal plane when no locking needles were used with
   a significant correlation (P < 0.01, R=0.637) between the place of
   insertion and rotation. It was shown that the method (with or without
   locking needles) had a significant (P < 0.001) influence on the rotation
   in the coronal plane. Rotations in the sagittal plane ranged from -8.5
   degrees to + 10.2 degrees without correlation with the insertion point
   of the needle or the use of locking needles.
   Conclusions: This study showed that prostate rotation during needle
   insertion for prostate brachytherapy is relatively large and
   unpredictable. Locking needles reduce prostate rotation in the coronal
   plane, but not in the sagittal plane. Minimising this rotation is
   necessary for accurate seed delivery, especially when a robotic
   implantation technique is used. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. Ali

Abstract = {{It is now accepted that most of the rivers and streams of Australia have
   been degraded to varying extents by European settlement. The scale and
   level of this degradation have been documented by State and Federal
   government authorities. To halt and reverse the degradation in the next
   two decades, it is crucial that the conservation and restoration of
   streams, rivers, riparian zones, and catchments become paramount in land
   and water management. Effective stream restoration requires a
   coordinated effort at the catchment level rather than at the level of
   many individual local sites. Monitoring, including the gathering of
   before-restoration data, and the setting of feasibly-attainable goals
   are key components of effective restoration. In planning projects and
   setting goals, it needs to be recognized that some goals may only be
   attained in the long-term. Large-scale restoration projects will require
   partnerships to be formed between resource managers and scientists, with
   other stakeholders possibly involved. Selected projects could be
   adaptively managed with the emphasis on gaining scientific knowledge on
   the effects of management interventions.}},

Abstract = {{For more than ten years the CEA has been using gamma imaging systems for
   radiological characterization purposes during decommissioning
   operations. This technology is very effective for detecting high-energy
   gamma emitters, but less so for characterizing actinides, which are
   mainly alpha emitters. In order to provide a full range of
   decommissioning tools, the gamma-cameras were supplemented by another
   imaging system capable of generating images directly from alpha
   emissions. This paper describes the initial laboratory and field test
   results obtained with a prototype camera capable of displaying alpha
   radioactivity. The system is based on the detection of ultraviolet
   radiation emitted by nitrogen when irradiated by alpha particles. The
   alpha contamination is localized by superimposing it on a visible-light
   image. All measurements must be carried out in complete darkness.
   Laboratory tests showed that the system is capable of detecting point
   sources and extended sources at levels as low as 430 Bq . cm(-2).
   Profile measurements of point sources revealed a scintillation bubble
   with dimensions corresponding to the range of alpha particles in air.
   The device is also capable of detecting the phenomenon through
   translucent materials such as glove box panels. The camera has been
   implemented for in situ examination of various fuel cycle facilities,
   and under these conditions has revealed alpha contamination without any
   breach of containment through several millimeters of plexiglas.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the combined effects of decreasing taxonomic resolution
   (i.e. species, family, phylum), the use of different mesh-size (1.0 mm
   and 0.5 mm) and the type of samplers used (van Veen vs. corers taken by
   divers) on the quality of data obtained, a comparative study was
   undertaken with the overall aim of identifying cost efficient methods
   for routinely monitoring the ecological change caused by Mediterranean
   fish farming. The results clearly showed that information loss was
   relatively low as data were aggregated at higher taxonomic levels,
   particularly up to the level of family or even order. It was also found
   that the extra information gained by sieving samples through a 0.5 mm
   sieve did not improve the ability to distinguish the potentially
   impacted sites from the control stations. Finally, it was found that a
   relatively large proportion of the available information concerning the
   community structure such as abundance, biomass or diversity is lost when
   sampling is carried out with corers. A cost/benefit ratio analysis for
   the two sampling and the two sieving methods showed minimal values for
   the van Veen samples (for both sieve fractions) at the family level,
   indicating that analysis at this level gives the best balance between
   precision of the results and decrease in taxonomic effort. However, if
   the time needed to sort the samples is included in the analysis, then
   samples taken with corers using a 0.5 mm sieve and identified to
   families seems like a good compromise between precision and cost. (c)

Abstract = {{A recent molecular investigation of kelp systematics revealed
   mitochondrial sequences that gave phylogenies inconsistent with those
   based on nuclear and chloroplast sequences for the species Lessoniopsis
   littoralis. Sequence from the mitochondrial nad6 region placed L.
   littoralis in the middle of a clade of Alaria species in our trees,
   whereas Rubisco and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences resolved L.
   littoralis within the Alariaceae, but distinct from Alaria. To resolve
   these conflicting results, the nad6 region was sequenced from additional
   samples of L. littoralis. The resulting data variously placed L.
   littoralis with Macrocystis integrifolia, Nereocystis luetkeana, and an
   additional Alaria isolate. A series of hypotheses were devised and
   explored to effectively exclude introgression via hybridization as a
   viable explanation for our observations. Rather, molecular and
   microscopy data revealed that gametophytes of Alaria, Macrocystis and
   Nereocystis epi/endophytically, colonize the older portions of the
   thallus of L. littoralis. A substantial primer mismatch, unique to L.

Title = {{To what extent do smokers plan quit attempts?}},
Journal = {{TOBACCO CONTROL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{425-428}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aims: Little is known about the extent to which quit attempts are
   planned ahead or initiated immediately following a sudden decision to
   quit. This is important because if most smokers quit abruptly, rather
   than plan ahead, this could impact heavily upon recommendations to
   health care professionals on the kind of smoking cessation advice they
   deliver to patients. This paper aims to address this gap in knowledge by
   examining detailed smoking histories taken from smoking and ex-smoking
   patients.
   Design: Face-to-face in depth semi-structured interviews.
   Participants: 146 smoking and ex-smoking patients within a family
   medicine practice were recruited by means of screening 700 consecutive
   patients ( 14 years of age and older) and inviting eligible patients to
   participate. To be eligible, patients had to have smoked a minimum of
   five cigarettes per day for at least six months in their lives and made
   at least one serious quit attempt that lasted at least 24 hours. There
   were no refusals. Ex-smokers (n = 67) were defined as those who had not
   smoked for six months. The remainder were classified as smokers (n =
   79).
   Measurements: Participants were asked to describe, in their own words,
   their most recent quit attempt and whether they had planned the quit
   attempt in advance, what were the triggers, and how long they abstained.
   A quit attempt was defined as planned if smokers set a quit date at some
   future time point. An unplanned quit attempt was defined as a sudden
   decision not to smoke any more cigarettes including those that might be
   remaining in the current pack. Information was also collected on methods
   used to quit and reasons for quitting.
   Results: A majority ( 51.6\%) of quit attempts were reported as being
   unplanned. The figure was higher for ex-smokers than for smokers (67.1\%
   v 36.7\%, p < 0.001). Most quit attempts were unaided (64\%) and made
   for reasons of health (64\%).
   Conclusions: The finding that so many quit attempts are unprepared
   suggests that models of smoking cessation should place greater emphasis
   on the dynamic nature of motivation to quit. This is an area that
   requires further investigation.}},

   carcinoma: implications for clinical practice}},
Journal = {{BJU INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To determine the diagnostic sensitivity of genetic studies using
   fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for detecting both new and
   recurrent cases of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) in a routine
   clinical practice setting, as bladder cancer has a significant risk of
   recurrence and progression to invasive disease and thus sensitive
   surveillance testing is very important.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS
   FISH was performed using the UroVysion(TM) kit (Vysis Inc., Downers
   Grove, IL, USA) Consecutive patients were assessed using FISH, both to
   evaluate those with a history of TCC or with suspicious symptoms, and
   the FISH results were compared with concurrent biopsy and cytological
   assessments.
   RESULTS
   In all, 521 consecutive FISH tests from 300 patients were evaluated;
   47\% had a history of bladder cancer and 53\% had suspicious symptoms.
   Of the 521 FISH tests, 24\% were positive; concurrent cytology was
   available for 84\% of the FISH tests, with a concordance rate of 78\%
   (6\% were positive for both and 72\% were negative by both tests). For
   the discordant cases, FISH was positive and cytology negative in 21\% of
   cases, and cytology was positive with a negative FISH for 1\%. In all,
   99 FISH tests had concurrent biopsy data. Of the 44 cases histologically
   positive for TCC, 32 were FISH-positive, resulting in an overall
   sensitivity (95\% confidence interval) of 73 (60-88)\%. FISH detected
   95\% of cases with high-grade carcinoma, while only seven of these 17
   were positive by concurrent cytological assessment. FISH detected 56\%
   and cytology detected 32\% of low-grade lesions. FISH detected all nine
   new cases with positive histology. Overall, the specificity of FISH was
   65 (53-78)\%. Of 112 patients with previous TCC, 28 had a recurrence; 22
   of these had positive FISH results.
   CONCLUSION
   FISH analysis has a high sensitivity for detecting new cases of TCC, as
   well as recurrences. From the present data FISH is considerably more
   sensitive and only slightly less specific than cytology in diagnosing
   TCC. Therefore, we recommend FISH as a useful initial diagnostic tool in
   patients suspected of both new and recurrent TCC.}},

   Consistent with the overall weakness of the Xe surface and Xe-Xe

   appropriate to systems consisting of nearly isolated fragments in which
   the coefficients of the van der Waals expansion are deduced from DFT
   calculations. Such generalized DFT calculations of potential energy
   surfaces yield the structure of Xe adlayers in good agreement with
   experiments and retrieve the dilation of commensurate monolayer phase in
   which the intralayer Xe-Xe radial force constants are strongly reduced.
   This provides a first principles interpretation of the observed

Abstract = {{Mutation in the Arabidopsis thaliana QUASIMODO 1 gene (QUA1), which
   encodes a putative glycosyltransferase, reduces cell wall pectin content
   and cell adhesion. Suspension-cultured calli were generated from roots
   of wild-type (wt) and qua1-1 A. thaliana plants. The altered cell
   adhesion phenotype of the qua1-1 plant was also found with its
   suspension-cultured calli. Cell walls of both wt and qua1-1 calli were
   analysed by chemical, enzymatic and immunohistochemical techniques in
   order to assess the role of pectic polysaccharides in the mutant
   phenotype. Compared with the wt, qua1-1 calli cell walls contained more
   arabinose (23.6 versus 21.6 mol\%), rhamnose (3.1 versus 2.7 mol\%), and
   fucose (1.4 versus 1.2 mol\%) and less uronic acid (24.2 versus 27.6
   mol\%), and they were less methyl-esterified (DM: 22.9\% versus 30.3\%).
   When sequential pectin extraction of calli cell walls was performed,
   qua1-1 water-soluble and chelator-soluble extracts contained more
   arabinose and less uronic acid than wt. Water-soluble pectins were less
   methyl-esterified in qua1-1 than in wt. Chelator-soluble pectins were
   more acetyl-esterified in qua1-1. Differences in the cell wall chemistry
   of wt and mutant calli were supported by a reduction in JIM7 labelling
   (methyl-esterified homogalacturonan) of the whole wall in small cells
   and particularly by a reduced labelling with 2F4 (calcium-associated
   homogalacturonan) in the middle lamella at tricellular junctions of
   large qua1-1 cells. Differences in the oligosaccharide profile obtained
   after endopolygalacturonase degradation of alkali extracts from qua1-1
   and wt calli indicated variations in the structure of covalently bonded
   homogalacturonan. About 29\% more extracellular polymers rich in pectins
   were recovered from the calli culture medium of qua1-1 compared with wt.
   These results show that perturbation of QUASIMODO 1-1 gene expression in
   calli resulted in alterations of homogalacturonan content and cell wall
   location. The consequences of these structural variations are discussed
   with regard to plant cell adhesion.}},

   union power exerts a ``U-type{''} impact on the use of indirect
   non-regular labor, while affecting directly employed nonregular labor in
   a positive linear way. Thirdly, labor unions in large establishments are
   more active and influential in representing their members' interests
   than their counterparts in small establishments with limited financial
   resources. In particular, the interactive function of the union's power
   and union leaders' attitudinal inclinations is found to be significant

Volume = {{183}},

Abstract = {{The antiatherogenic role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been
   related to its ability to increase the activity of endothelial nitric
   oxide synthase (eNOS) and to protect low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
   against oxidative modification. The present study was aimed to determine
   whether and how HDL antagonizes oxidized LDL (oxLDL) that has been
   formed and accumulated in circulation. Pre-infusion of rats with HDL
   effectively prevented oxLDL-induced renal vascular constriction.
   Consistently, pre-incubation of human saphenous vein endothelial cells
   with HDL (100 mu g/ml) reversed the oxLDL-induced suppression of
   endothelium-dependent cyclic-GMP production in co-cultured smooth muscle
   cells. However, the changes of Akt phosphorylation and eNOS activity in
   endothelial cells in response to lipoprotein treatments under our assay
   condition were not significant. Intriguingly, pretreatment of human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells with HDL (50 mu g/ml) for only 30 s
   effectively reduced the level of free radicals generated by oxLDL or
   H2O2. In kidneys of living rats, renal arterial infusion of oxLDL
   greatly enhanced ischemia/reperfusion-induced free radicals, which could
   be attenuated by HDL pretreatment. We conclude that HDL may antagonize
   oxLDL on endothelial function through an Akt-independent pathway in
   which HDL preserves nitric oxide bioactivity by attenuating
   oxLDL-triggered free radical generation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Journal = {{ELECTROPHORESIS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{4616-4624}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents systematic investigation of the microchannel surface
   properties in microCE chips. Three popular materials for microCE chips,
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), quartz, and glass, are used. The zeta
   potentials of these microchannels are calculated by measuring the EOF
   velocity to evaluate the surface properties after surface modification.
   The hydrophobic PDMS is usually plasma-treated for microCE applications.
   In this study, a new method using a high-throughput atmospheric plasma
   generator is adopted to treat the PDMS surface under atmospheric
   conditions. In this approach, the cost and time for surface treatment
   can be significantly reduced compared with the conventional vacuum
   plasma generator method. Experimental results indicate that new
   functional groups could be formed on the PDMS surface after treatment,
   resulting in a change in the surface property. The time-dependent
   surface property of the plasma-treated PDMS is then measured in terms of
   the zeta potential. Results show that the surface property will reach a
   stable condition after 1 h of plasma treatment. For glass CE chips, two
   new methods for changing the microchannel surface properties are
   developed. Instead of using complicated and time-consuming chemical
   silanization procedures for CE channel surface modification, two simple
   and reliable methods utilizing organic-based spin-on-glass and
   water-soluble acrylic resin are reported. The proposed method provides a
   fast batch process for controlling the surface properties of glass-based
   CE channels. The proposed methods are evaluated using phi X-174 DNA
   maker separation: The experimental data show that the surface property
   is modified and separation efficiency greatly improved. In addition, the
   long-term stability of both coatings is verified in this study. The
   methods proposed in this study show potential as an excellent solution
   for glass-based microCE chip surface modification.}},

   electron microscopy and electron diffraction. The crystallization
   temperature of the 8YSZ gel powders was estimated to be about 729 K by
   DTA analysis. When calcined from 773 to 1273 K, the crystallization of
   the cubic phase was observed by XRD, The crystallite size of the 8YSZ
   increased from 7.14 to 20.10 nm with calcining temperature increasing
   from 773 to 1273 K. The activation energy for growth of 8YSZ
   nanoparticles was found to be 7.26 kJ/mol. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The electrocardiogramme and methods of prolonged ECG recording are
   sufficient for diagnosing most cardiac arrhythmias. They also provide
   some prognostic information and allow evaluation and follow-up of
   treatment. However, in some situations, endocavitary
   electrophysiological investigations are required when the diagnosis is
   uncertain, that more prognostic information is required or
   interventional techniques (endocavitary ablation) are envisaged.
   The aim of this report is to summarise the value and limitations of
   programmed ventricular stimulation. Many of its indications have been
   abandoned in terms of rhythm stratification in the face of more robust
   parameters, in particular the left ventricular ejection fraction.
   However, it retains a potential utility in terms of prognosis in
   arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, the Brugada syndrome and
   operated Tetralogy of Fallot.
   In any event, it is important to remember that studies resulting in
   diagnostic or therapeutic recommendations were performed with strict
   protocols of stimulation in selected patients and that these
   recommendations can only be applied when the evaluation protocols are
   respected.
   The indications of programmed ventricular stimulation will increase in
   the therapeutic field with the development of new techniques of 3D
   mapping, new systems of catheter guiding which should extend the
   indications of endocavitary ablation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the effect of pile diameter on the unit shaft
   friction that can develop on a pile in sand. The study is based on a
   series of tension tests conducted on centrifuge model piles with a range
   of pile diameters and average initial stress levels. The inferred
   significant increases in lateral effective stresses on the shafts of
   these piles at peak capacity are shown to be consistent with the normal
   displacement (dilation)-stiffness relationship measured in appropriate
   constant normal stiffness (CNS) interface tests. The determination of
   the lateral stress increases (and hence shaft capacity) also requires
   measurement or prediction of the non-linear cavity expansion stiffness
   of the sand surrounding the pile shaft. Predictions obtained for this
   stiffness using a numerical technique indicate that the operational
   stiffness surrounding a model pile is well below that assuming the very
   small strain (elastic) stiffness, and that the degree of normal
   displacement (and hence the lateral stress increase) depends
   significantly on the sand's non-linear stiffness characteristics. A
   predictive approach, which combines the CNS interface data with cavity
   expansion stiffness, is shown to perform well against an independent
   test series of model pile tests and to be potentially suitable for the
   evaluation of lateral stress changes that take place during loading of
   full-scale piles.}},

Abstract = {{Myanmar is one of the most forested countries in mainland South-cast
   Asia. These forests support a large number of important species and
   endemics and have great value for global efforts in biodiversity
   conservation. Landsat satellite imagery from the 1990s and 2000s was
   used to develop a countrywide forest map and estimate deforestation. The
   country has retained much of its forest cover, but forests have declined
   by 0.3\% annually. Deforestation varied considerably among
   administrative units, with central and more populated states and
   divisions showing the highest losses. Ten deforestation hotspots had
   annual deforestation rates well above the countrywide average. Major
   reasons for forest losses in these hotspots stemmed from increased
   agricultural conversion, fuelwood consumption, charcoal production,
   commercial logging and plantation development. While Myanmar continues
   to be a stronghold for closed canopy forests, several areas have been
   experiencing serious deforestation. Most notable are the mangrove
   forests in the Ayeyarwady delta region and the remaining dry forests at
   the northern edge of the central dry zone.}},

Abstract = {{Beta titanium alloys are increasingly the best choice for automotive and

   Among these alloys, the TIMETAL Ti-LCB is already used in the automotive
   industry because it presents excellent mechanical properties and a lower
   cost compared with other Ti alloys. The current study deals with the
   characterization of the nucleation and growth of the alpha phase in
   several thermomechanical processes, because the distribution and size of
   the alpha phase strongly influence the mechanical properties of the
   resulting microstructures. Several heat treatments were conducted after
   either cold rolling or annealing. The resulting microstructures were
   characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
   microscopy, x-ray diffraction, or electron backscatter diffraction. It
   was observed that the morphology and the volume fraction of the alpha
   phase are strongly dependent on the holding temperature, on the heating

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We have studied the nonlinear elasticity effects in zinc-blende and
   wurtzite crystallographic phases of III-N compounds. Particularly, we
   have determined the pressure dependences of elastic constants in InN,
   GaN, and AlN by performing ab initio calculations in the framework of
   plane-wave pseudopotential implementation of the density-functional
   theory. The calculations have been performed employing two
   exchange-correlation functionals, one within the local density
   approximation and the other within the generalized gradient
   approximation. We have found that C-11, C-12 in zinc-blende nitrides and
   C-11, C-12, C-13, C-33 in wurtzite nitrides depend significantly on
   hydrostatic pressure. Much weaker dependence on pressure has been
   observed for C-44 elastic constant in both zinc-blende and wurtzite
   phases. Further, we have examined the influence of pressure dependence
   of elastic constants on the pressure coefficient of light emission,
   dE(E)/dP, in wurtzite InGaN/GaN and GaN/AlGaN quantum wells. We have
   shown that the pressure dependence of elastic constants leads to a
   significant reduction of dE(E)/dP in nitride quantum wells. Finally, we
   have considered the influence of nonlinear elasticity of III-N compounds
   on the properties of hexagonal nitride quantum dots (QDs). For typical
   wurtzite GaN/AlN QDs, we have shown that taking into account pressure
   dependence of elastic constants results in the decrease of volumetric
   strain in the QD region by about 7\%. Simultaneously, the average z
   component of the piezoelectric polarization in the QDs increases by 0.1
   MV/cm compared to the case when linear elastic theory is used. Both
   effects, i.e., decrease of volumetric strain as well as increase of
   piezoelectric field, decrease the band-to-band transition energies in
   the QDs.}},

Journal = {{KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{68}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. The immunosuppressor cyclosporine A (CsA) presents the
   nephrotoxicity as its major side effect that is mostly attributed to a
   renal vasoconstriction. This may be due to an excessive generation of
   vasoconstrictors like reactive oxygen species (ROS), or due to a
   reduction of vasodilators such as the nitric oxide, which in turn, can
   be caused by increased amounts of ROS. We evaluated the effect of CsA
   and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on inducible nitric oxide
   synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression and nitric oxide synthesis, in rat renal
   artery vascular smooth muscle cells (rVSMCs) primary culture.
   Methods. In cells treated during 72 hours with CsA (10 mu g/mL), its
   vehicle (control) (10 mu L/mL), Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS) (100 mu g/mL), CsA + LPS, NAC (6.13 mmol/L), or CsA + NAC, we
   determined the nitric oxide synthesis ( Griess and chemiluminescence
   methods), iNOS expression {[}reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction (RTPCR)] and cell viability (acridine orange method).
   Results. In rVSMCs, LPS increased nitric oxide and iNOS expression; CsA
   decreased basal and LPS-induced nitric oxide and iNOS expression; NAC
   increased nitric oxide and blunted the nitric oxide reduction caused by
   CsA, with no effect on iNOS. CsA reduced cell viability.
   Conclusion. In this study, CsA reduced nitric oxide synthesis in rVSMCs,
   both through iNOS down-regulation and reduction of cell viability, which
   could be responsible for the vasoconstrictive effect of the CsA. In the
   effect of CsA on nitric oxide, probably a role is also played by free
   radical production, as this effect was blunted by NAC.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{The present study quantifies changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks
   in Belgium between 1960, 1990 and 2000 for 289 spatially explicit land
   units with unique soil association and land-use type, termed landscape
   units (LSU). The SOC stocks are derived from multiple nonstandardized
   sets of field measurements up to a depth of 30 cm.
   Approximately half of the LSU show an increase in SOC between 1960 and
   2000. The significant increases occur mainly in soils of grassland LSU
   in northern Belgium. Significant decreases are observed on loamy
   cropland soils. Although the largest SOC gains are observed for LSU
   under forest (22 t C ha(-1) for coniferous and 29 t C ha(-1) for
   broadleaf and mixed forest in the upper 30 cm of soil), significant
   changes are rare because of large variability. Because the number of
   available measurements is very high for agricultural land, most
   significant changes occur under cropland and grassland, but the
   corresponding average SOC change is smaller than for forests (9 t C
   ha(-1) increase for grassland and 1 t C ha(-1) decrease for cropland).
   The 1990 data for agricultural LSU show that the SOC changes between
   1960 and 2000 are not linear. Most agricultural LSU show a higher SOC
   stock in 1990 than in 2000, especially in northern Belgium. The observed
   temporal and spatial patterns can be explained by a change in manure
   application intensity.
   SOC stock changes caused by land-use change are estimated. The SOC
   change over time is derived from observed differences between SOC stocks
   in space. Because SOC stocks are continuously influenced by a number of
   external factors, mainly land-use history and current land management
   and climate, this approach gives only an approximate estimate whose
   validity is limited to these conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol administration of live measles vaccine virus has proven to be
   extremely efficacious in field trials using an industrial compressor
   coupled to a disposable nebulizer (IPI). To develop a new system for
   administration, it is necessary to characterize the operating
   characteristics of the old system. There are no standardized techniques
   for measuring particle size of live biological agents. This study
   evaluated the Next Generation Pharmaceutical Impactor's (NGI) ability to
   particle size wet aerosols in an effort to measure the particle size
   distribution of live measles vaccine from the IPI nebulizer. As a
   control albuterol was aerosolized using a Pari LC Star, since the
   soluble albuterol is evenly distributed throughout the droplets and
   laser diffraction measurements should agree with those from the NGI, as
   long as the NGI is cooled to prevent heat transfer to the aerosol.
   Albuterol was also used as a control for the IPI using quantitative
   ultraviolet spectrophotometry. There was close agreement in MMD (mean
   +/- 95\% CI) for the LC Star, measured by laser diffraction (3.24 +/-
   0.06 mu m) and the NGI (2.93 +/- 0.22 mu m) and the IPI (4.26 +/- 0.1-7
   and 4.26 +/- 0.24 mu m, respectively). For the measles vaccine assayed
   for plaque forming units, there were significant differences between the
   NGI MMD (6.14 +/- 0.39 mu m) compared to laser diffraction (4.95 +/-
   0.16 mu m) indicating that the vaccine is not evenly distributed among
   the droplets of various sizes. This is likely clumping of the virus due
   to gelatin in the formulation. These data indicate that the NGI is
   capable of particle sizing live biological agents.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the effects of Poland's reforms in the period
   1990-2005 on corruption in the health care system. In the last 15 years
   Poland has transformed its economy drastically, introducing
   market-oriented reforms into almost every aspect of its economy. In this
   study we consider how different reforms changed incentives and
   mechanisms facilitating corruption in the medical care sector. Our
   conclusion is that corruption in Poland's medical sector has worsened
   since the onset of the marketization. reforms. We support this
   conclusion primarily by analyzing changes in incentives for corruption
   and the number of mechanisms facilitating it. In addition, where
   available, quantitative data are provided, though we recognize that
   numerical estimates of corruption are subject to substantial error. We
   focus on three major forms of corruption: patient payments to secure
   medical treatment or improve its quality, payments from industry (mostly
   pharmaceutical and medical equipment producers), and the use by
   physicians of free public facilities for private patients. (c) 2005 The

Abstract = {{Overexpression of a novel oncogene MCT-1 (multiple copies in a T cell
   malignancy) causes malignant transformation of murine fibroblasts. To
   establish its role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer in humans, we
   generated stable transfectants of MCF7 breast cancer cells negative for
   endogenous MCT-1 (MCF7-MCT-1). Overexpression of MCT-1 in these cells
   resulted in a slight elevation of estrogen receptor-alpha, and higher
   rates of DNA synthesis and growth in response to estradiol compared with
   the empty vector control (MCF7-EV). The pure antiestrogen fulvestrant
   inhibited the estradiol-stimulated proliferation of MCF7-MCT-1 cells.
   The MCF7-MCT-1 clones showed increased invasiveness in the presence of
   50\% serum compared with the MCF7-EV. In a tumor xenograft model,
   MCT-1-overexpressing cells showed higher take rates and formed
   significantly larger tumors than MCF7-EV controls. When we examined
   angiogenic phenotype and molecular mediators of angiogenesis in
   MCF7-MCT-1 tumors in vivo, we found greater microvascular density and
   lower apoptosis in the MCF7-MCT-1 tumors compared with MCF7-EV controls
   accompanied by a dramatic decline in the levels of angiogenesis
   inhibitor, thrombospondin-1 (TSPI). In vitro, blocking TSPI in the
   medium conditioned by MCT-1-negative cells restored its angiogenic
   potential to that of the MCF7-MCT-1 cells. Conversely, despite an
   increase in mRNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor upon MCT-1
   overexpression, vascular endothelial growth factor protein levels have
   not been notably altered. Taken together, our results suggest that MCT-1
   may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of human breast
   cancer via at least two routes: promotion of angiogenesis through the
   decline of TSPI and inhibition of apoptosis.}},

Abstract = {{Women who have PTSD related to childhood abuse have significant deficits
   in the areas of emotion regulation and interpersonal skills. These
   problems are associated with impaired functioning in social, work, and

   an evidence-based, 2-phase cognitive behavioral treatment designed to
   address these concerns. Specifically, this treatment targets PTSD
   symptoms, emotion-regulation deficits, and interpersonal difficulties.
   The purpose of this article is to describe the rationale for and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for developing

   organizational levels of analysis, depending on the nature of the
   concept under study. The methodology is presented as a research guide
   progressing through three stages: (1) domain definition, (2) instrument
   construction, and (3) evaluation of measurement properties. The
   methodology addresses six key measurement properties (content validity,
   factorial validity, reliability, convergent validity, discriminant
   validity, nomological validity), which are discussed in detail. An
   assessment of the proposed methodology indicates that its adoption in
   MIS research would greatly improve the rigor of construct development
   projects. This is evidenced by the wide range of quality publications
   that have used its techniques and its performance when compared to a
   number of prominent standards for assessing construct development

Abstract = {{A new family follows the separation of a former nuclear family. At least
   one of the new partners and its children had to do mourning work to
   overcome the former separation. Children and adolescents need a reliable
   network of familiar relations. The following article discusses the
   communalities and differences and the chances and difficulties in new
   families (patchwork families, successive families and step families).
   The ressources of all the members, adults and children, are a key issue.
   Flexibility and dynamics are special resources of new families which can
   be learned in a therapeutic process. A special focus lies on the
   strengths of the sibling relations. A high capacity to communicate and
   to handle the actual problems is needed to succeed as a new family. A
   new family means the ongoing bargaining of the former and actual
   relationships as parents and as children.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2005}},

Abstract = {{Nucleon-nucleon (NN) cross sections are evaluated in neutron-rich matter
   using a scaling model according to density, momentum, and isospin
   dependent nucleon effective masses. It is found that the in-medium NN
   cross sections are not only reduced but also have a different isospin
   dependence compared with the free-space ones. Because of the
   neutron-proton effective mass splitting the difference between nn and pp
   scattering cross sections increases with the increasing isospin
   asymmetry of the medium. Within the transport model IBUU04, the
   in-medium NN cross sections are found to influence significantly the
   isospin transport in heavy-ion reactions. With the in-medium NN cross
   sections, a symmetry energy of E-sym(rho) approximate to
   31.6(rho/rho(0))(0.69) was found most acceptable compared with both the
   MSU isospin diffusion data and the presently acceptable neutron-skin
   thickness in Pb-208. The isospin dependent part K-asy(rho(0)) of
   isobaric nuclear incompressibility was further narrowed down to -500 +/-
   50 MeV. The possibility of determining simultaneously the in-medium NN
   cross sections and the symmetry energy was also studied. The proton
   transverse flow, or even better the combined transverse flow of neutrons
   and protons, can be used as a probe of the in-medium NN cross sections
   without much hindrance from the uncertainties of the symmetry energy.}},

Abstract = {{Grindability index of coal is usually determined by Hardgrove
   Grindability Index (HGI). The correlation between the proximate analysis
   of Chinese coal and HGI was studied. It was found from statistical
   analysis that, the higher the moisture and the volatile matter content
   in coal, the less the HGI will be. On the contrary, the higher the ash
   and the fixed carbon content in coal, the higher the HGI will be. But
   the correlation between proximate analysis and HGI in coals is
   nonlinear. The prediction equation of HGI reported in literature, which
   is based on proximate analysis of coal and linear regression method, is
   not correct for coals in China. In this paper, the generalized
   regression neural network (GRNN) method was used to predict the HGI. A
   higher precision in the prediction result was obtained through such new
   method. By this method, the HGI can be estimated indirectly from the
   proximate analysis of coal when the HGI measurement equipment is not
   available. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   This essay outlines the major forces that constitute and reconstitute

   taken on by urban municipal governments, which is many times
   strengthened by the land leasing system. Place promotion and image
   building are targeted not only at transnational corporations, but also
   at state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and large private enterprises. The
   influx of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the corporate reforms have
   brought about much wider income spreads, and the formation of a new
   urban middle class. This, together with the housing reform of 1998-99
   and reforms in the financial sector has added a choice dimension to the
   urban spatial form. At the same time, the reforms have also produced a
   new class of urban poor struggling to cling to the dwindling stock of

Abstract = {{The breast-specific antigen a-lactalbumin is expressed in > 60\% of
   breast cancer tissues. To evaluate the effect of gene therapy for breast
   cancer by controlling adenovirus replication with human a-lactalbumin
   promoter, we investigated the activity of a 762-bP human
   alpha-lactalbumin promoter. alpha-Lactalbumin promoter showed
   significantly higher activity in MDA-MB-435S and T47D breast cancer
   cells than in normal breast cell lines or other tumor cell lines. We
   then developed two novel breast cancer-restricted replicative
   adenoviruses, AdALAE1a and AdE1aALAE1b. In AdALAE1a, expression of
   adenoviral E1a gene is under the control of a-lactalbumin promoter, and
   in AdE1aALAE1b, expression of both E1a and E1b genes is under the
   control of a single alpha-lactalbumin promoter. Both breast
   cancer-restricted replicative adenoviruses showed viral replication
   efficiency and tumor cell-killing capability similar to wild-type
   adenovirus in MDA-MB-435S and T47D cells. The replication efficiency and
   tumor cell-killing capability of both viruses were attenuated
   significantly in cells that did not support a-lactalbumin promoter.
   AdE1aALAE1b showed better breast cancer-restricted replication than
   AdALAE1a, suggesting that a transcriptional targeting modality with
   alpha-lactalbumin promoter controlling both E1a and E1b gene expression
   is superior to a-lactalbumin promoter controlling only E1a gene
   expression. Importantly, we found that AdE1aALAE1b could be used to
   target hormone-independent breast tumors in vivo by inhibiting the
   growth of MDA-MB-435S s.c. tumors. These data showed that a-lactalbumin
   promoter could regulate the replication of adenovirus to target
   hormone-independent breast cancers, suggesting that a-lactalbumin
   promoter can be used to develop a novel therapeutic modality for
   hormone-independent breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Divergence of proteins in signaling pathways requires ligand and
   receptor coevolution to maintain or improve binding affinity and/or
   specificity. In this paper we show a clear case of coevolution between
   the prolactin (PRL) gene and its receptor (prolactin receptor, PRLR) in
   mammals. First we observed episodic evolution of the extracellular and
   intracellular domains of the PRLR, which is closely consistent with that
   seen in PRL. Correlated evolution was demonstrated both between PRL and
   its receptor and between the two domains of the PRLR using Pearson's
   correlation coefficient. On comparing the ratio of the nonsynonymous
   substitution rate to synonymous substitution rate (omega=d(N)/d(S)) for
   each branch of the star phylogeny of mammalian PRLRs, separately for the
   extracellular domain (ECD) and the transmembrane domain/intracellular
   domain (TMD/ICD), we observed a lower omega ratio for ECD than TMD/ICD
   along those branches leading to pig, dog and rabbit but a higher ratio
   for ECD than TMD/ICD on the branches leading to primates, rodents and
   ruminants, on which bursts of rapid evolution were observed. These
   observations can be best explained by coevolution between PRL and its
   receptor and between the two domains of the PRLR.}},

Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{A methodology termed membrane-interaction QSAR (MI-QSAR) analysis has
   been used to develop QSAR models to predict drug permeability
   coefficients across cornea and its component layers (epithelium, stroma,
   and endothelium). From a training set of 25 structurally diverse drugs,
   significant QSAR models are constructed and compared for the
   permeability of the cornea, epithelium, and stroma plus endothelium.
   Cornea permeability is found to depend on the measured distribution
   coefficient of the drug, the cohesive energy of the drug, the total
   potential energy of the drug-membrane ``complex,{''} and three other
   energy refinement descriptor terms. The endothelium may be a more
   important barrier in cornea permeation than the stroma. Moreover, an
   investigation of the correlation between cornea permeation and eye
   irritation is presented as an example of a cross study on different
   ADMET properties using MI-QSAR analysis. Thirteen structurally diverse
   drugs, whose molar-adjusted eye irritation scores (MES) have been
   measured using the Draize rabbit-eye test, were chosen as an eye
   irritation comparison set. A poor correlation (R-2 = 0.0232) between the
   MES measures and the predicted cornea permeability coefficients for the
   drugs in the eye irritation set suggests there is no significant
   relationship between eye irritation potency and the cornea permeability.}},

Title = {{Effect of hereditary obesity on renal expressions of NO synthase,

Journal = {{KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background. Obesity has emerged as a major cause of diabetes,
   cardiovascular disease, and renal insufficiency worldwide. Obese Zucker
   rats exhibit hyperphagia, obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia,
   and glomerulosclerosis and are frequently used as a model to study
   hereditary form of metabolic syndrome. Nitric oxide plays a major role
   in preservation of renal function and structure. The present study was
   designed to test the hypothesis that renal disease in this model may be
   associated with down-regulation of endothelial (eNOS) and neuromal NO
   synthases (nNOS) in the kidney. The study further sought to explore
   expressions of caveolin-1, phospho AKt, and calmodulin, which regulate
   activities of constituitive NOS isoforms, as well as soluble guanylate
   cyclase (sGC), which is involved in NO signaling.
   Methods. Twenty-two-week-old male obese and lean Zucker rats were
   studied. Body weight, serum lipids, urine albumin excretion, and renal
   tissue abundance of the above proteins were determined.
   Results. Serum glucose and arterial pressure were unchanged, whereas
   urinary NO metabolite (NO chi) excretion and renal tissue nitrotyrosine
   abundance were markedly reduced (denoting depressed NO production) in
   the obese versus lean Zucker rats. This was accompanied by significant
   glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial damage, renal immune cell
   infiltration, marked down-regulations of renal tissue eNOS and nNOS,
   mild reduction of caveolin-1, and unchanged calmodulin, phospho-AKt, and
   sGC.
   Conclusion. Hereditary obesity can result in down-regulations of kidney
   eNOS and nNOS, marked reduction of NO production, and glomerulosclerosis
   prior to the onset of frank diabetes and hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing is widely recognized as a promising
   paradigm for building next generation distributed applications. However,
   the autonomous, heterogeneous, and decentralized nature of participating
   peers introduces the following challenge for resource sharing: how to
   make peers profitable in the untrusted P2P environment? To address the
   problem, we present a self-policing and distributed approach by
   combining two models: PET, a personalized trust model, and M- CUBE, a
   multiple- currency based economic model, to lay a foundation for
   resource sharing in untrusted P2P computing environments. PET is a
   flexible trust model that can adapt to different requirements, and
   provides the solid support for the currency management in M-CUBE. M-CUBE
   provides a novel self-policing and quality-aware framework for the
   sharing of multiple resources, including both homogeneous and
   heterogeneous resources. We evaluate the efficacy and performance of
   this approach in the context of a real application, a peer-to-peer Web
   server sharing. Our results show that our approach is flexible enough to
   adapt to different situations and effective to make the system
   profitable, especially for systems with large scale.}},

Abstract = {{Cochlear outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility is believed to be
   responsible for the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the

   effects of the constraints imposed on the OHC and of the surrounding
   fluids on the cell's high-frequency active force generated under in
   vitro and in vivo conditions. The OHC is modeled as a viscoelastic and
   piezoelectric cylindrical shell coupled with viscous intracellular and
   extracellular fluids, and the constraint is represented by a spring with
   adjustable stiffness. The solution is obtained in the form of a Fourier
   series. T e model results are consistent with previously reported
   experiments under both low- and high-frequency conditions. We find that
   constrained OHCs achieve a much higher corner frequency than free OHCs,
   depending on the stiffness of the constraint. We analyze cases in which
   the stiffness of the constraint is similar to that of the BM, reticular
   lamina, and tectorial membrane, and find that the force per unit
   transmembrane potential generated by the OHC can be constant up to
   several tens of kHz. This model, describing the OHC as a local
   amplifier, can be incorporated into a global cochlear model that
   considers cochlear hydrodynamics and frequency modulation of the
   receptor potential, as well as the graded BM stiffness and OHC length.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments are conducted here to investigate how the channel size
   affects the saturated flow boiling heat transfer and associated bubble
   characteristics of refrigerant R-134a in a horizontal narrow annular
   duct. The gap of the duct is fixed at 1.0 and 2.0 mm in this study. The
   measured heat transfer data indicate that the saturated flow boiling
   heat transfer coefficient increases with a decrease in the gap of the
   duct. Besides, raising the imposed heat flux can cause a significant
   increase in the boiling heat transfer coefficients. However, the effects
   of the refrigerant mass flux and saturated temperature on the boiling
   heat transfer coefficient are milder. The results from the flow
   visualization show that the mean diameter of the bubbles departing from
   the heating surface decreases slightly at increasing R-134a mass flux.
   Moreover, the bubble departure frequency increases at reducing duct size
   mainly due to the rising shear stress of the liquid flow, and at a high
   imposed heat flux many bubbles generated from the cavities in the
   heating surface tend to merge together to form big bubbles. Correlation
   for the present saturated flow boiling heat transfer data of R-134a in
   the narrow annular duct is proposed. Additionally, data for some
   quantitative bubble characteristics such as the mean bubble departure
   diameter and frequency and the active nucleation site density are also
   correlated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper designs a new multilayered particle anisotropic conductive
   film (ACF) compound. Using the particle-reinforced composite model and
   probability theory, the novel ACF compound is compared with three
   traditional ACFs having the same particle volume fraction. The
   particle-reinforced model applies the concept of bonded and debonded
   structures in the interfaces between the adhesive resin and the
   particles. The elastic modulus of the particle-reinforced ACF is a
   function of the particle volume fraction and the bonded condition. In
   the failure model, probability theory is used to calculate the
   probability of opening and bridging. The volume fraction of the
   conductive particles plays an important role in determining the optimal
   ACF design. The current results indicate that the flip chip packaging
   performed using the novel multilayered particle ACF compound (particles
   distributed in the top/bottorn surface layers) exhibits superior
   particle-reinforcement properties and a lower failure probability than
   traditional ACFs. The improved understanding of reinforcement mechanisms

Abstract = {{Background: Increased susceptibility of umbilical cord blood (CB) T
   cells to FK506 immunosuppression may contribute to the lessened severity
   of graft-vs-host disease in CB transplantation.
   Objective: To investigate the FK506 sensitivity of interleukin 15
   (IL-15)- and IL-2-driven proliferation and apoptosis of
   anti-CD3-stimulated CB T cells compared with adult peripheral blood
   (APB) T cells.
   Methods: Surface flow cytometric analysis (CD25 and CD95),
   carboxyfluorescein diacetae succinimidyl ester staining to track CD3(+)
   T-cell division, and flow cytometric analysis of apoptotic cell death
   using Annexin V were performed to determine the effect of FK506 on
   CD3(+) T-cell activation and apoptosis after anti-CD3 stimulation in the
   presence of IL-15 or IL-2.
   Results: IL-15 is superior to IL-2 in promoting CD25 expression and
   proliferation of anti-CD3-stimulated CB and APB T cells. Although
   IL-15-driven proliferation evaluated by carboxyfluorescein diacetae
   succinimidyl ester staining revealed comparable sensitivity to FK506 in
   anti-CD3-stimulated CB and APB T cells, IL-15-driven CD25 up-regulation
   in CB T cells was more sensitive to FK506 inhibition than APB T cells.
   FK506 down-regulated anti-CD3-induced apoptosis in CB and APB T cells (P
   < .01). However, the FK506 sensitivity of anti-CD3-induced T-cell
   apoptosis was lost in IL-15-supplemented CB Cultures (P = .51) but not
   in corresponding APB Cultures (P = .002). The IL-15-enhanced Fas
   expression on CB T cells (CD95) was decreased by FK506, similar to that
   observed with adults.
   Conclusions: We observed differential FK506 sensitivity of IL-15-driven
   CD25 up-regulation and apoptotic response comparing CB and APB T cells.
   This finding suggests the potential therapeutic benefit of FK506 in
   ameliorating graft-vs-host disease by decreasing IL-15-driven donor
   T-cell proliferation without inhibiting associated activation-induced
   apoptosis during CB transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Intrachamber challenge with Porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381 in a
   mouse subcutaneous chamber model results in a local infection that
   progresses to exfoliation of the chambers within 15 days. This study was
   designed to elucidate the contribution of host reactions to tissue
   destruction manifested by chamber exfoliation in animals infected with
   P. gingivalis. Chamber fluids showed increasing levels of prostaglandin
   E, with infection, and the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in
   chamber fluids peaked just before chamber exfoliation. Intraperitoneal
   injection of a TNF inhibitor, thalidomide (TH), reduced the number of
   exfolliated chambers, while indomethacin had no effect. Exogenous TNF in
   chambers without bacterial infection did not cause chamber exfoliation
   but induced neutrophil infiltration. In a dual-chamber model, two
   chambers were implanted in the same mouse. One chamber was infected with
   P. gingivalis, and 9 days later exogenous TNF was added to the other
   chamber. Altogether, 66.67\% of uninfected chambers were exfoliated
   between day 11 and day 16, although no bacteria were recovered from
   uninfected chambers. TH treatment alleviated both infected and
   uninfected chamber exfoliation. In this study, tissue destruction caused
   by P. gingivalis 381 infection was due to the elevation of the TNF
   levels and not due to local bacterial activities. Our results further
   indicate that local infection by P. gingivalis 381, a nondisseminating
   strain, actually has systemic effects on the host pathological outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus papain-like protease
   (SARS-CoV PLpro) is involved in the processing of the viral polyprotein
   and, thereby, contributes to the biogenesis of the virus replication
   complex. Structural bioinformatics has revealed a relationship for the
   SARS-CoV PLpro to herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease
   (HAUSP), a ubiquitin-specific protease, indicating potential
   deubiquitinating activity in addition to its function in polyprotein
   processing (T. Sulea, H. A. Lindner, E. O. Purisima, and R. Menard, J.
   Virol. 79:4550-4551, 2005). In order to confirm this prediction, we
   overexpressed and purified SARS-CoV PLpro (amino acids {[}aa] 1507 to
   1858) from Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed
   ubiquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC), a general deubiquitinating
   enzyme substrate, with a catalytic efficiency of 13,100 M(-1)s(-1),
   220-fold more efficiently than the small synthetic peptide substrate
   Z-LRGG-AMC, which incorporates the C-terminal four residues of
   ubiquitin. In addition, SARS-CoV PLpro was inhibited by the specific
   deubiquitinating enzyme inhibitor ubiquitin aldehyde, with an inhibition
   constant of 210 nM. The purified SARS-CoV PLpro disassembles branched
   polyubiquitin chains with lengths of two to seven (Ub2-7) or four (Ub4)
   units, which involves isopeptide bond cleavage. SARS-CoV PLpro
   processing activity was also detected against a protein fused to the C
   terminus of the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15, both in vitro using the
   purified enzyme and in HeLa cells by coexpression with SARS-CoV PLpro
   (aa 1198 to 2009). These results clearly establish that SARS-CoV PLpro
   is a deubiquitinating enzyme, thereby confirming our earlier prediction.
   This unexpected activity for a coronavirus papain-like protease suggests
   a novel viral strategy to modulate the host cell ubiquitination
   machinery to its advantage.}},

Abstract = {{We report the structure of the flock house virus B2 protein, a potent
   suppressor of RNA interference (RNAi) in animals and plants. The B2
   protein is a homodimer in solution and contains three alpha-helices per
   monomer. Chemical shift perturbation shows that an antiparallel
   arrangement of helices (alpha 2/alpha 2') forms an elongated binding
   interface with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This implies a novel mode of
   dsRNA recognition and provides insights into the mechanism of RNAi
   suppression by B2.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate whether bone formation under Teflon capsules may be enhanced
   by concomitant implantation of recombinant human platelet-derived growth
   factor-BB/insulin-like growth factor-I (rhPDGF-BB/IGF-I) incorporated
   into a methyl cellulose gel.
   Fifty-five male 6-month-old albino rats of the Wistar strain were used
   in the study. The lateral aspect of the mandibular ramus was exposed on
   both sides of the jaw. In 70 sites, the periosteum was removed from the
   ramus, leaving the bone denuded, while in 35 sites, it was preserved. On
   10 non-periosteal (P-) sites and five periosteal (P+) sites, an empty
   rigid teflon capsule (d=7 mm), serving as control, was placed on the
   ramus. In the 40 test animals, the capsule placed on the one side of the
   jaw was filled at random with one of three different concentrations
   (1200, 600, 150 mu g/ml) of rhPDGF-BB/IGF-I gel. The capsules placed on
   the contralateral side of the jaw contained a placebo methyl cellulose
   gel. Each growth factor group, defined according to the gel
   concentration, and the placebo group contained 10 capsules placed on the
   P- side and five capsules placed on the P+ side. Two months after
   surgery, all animals were sacrificed.
   Histologic analysis revealed that in the non-filled control capsules,
   the amount of new bone including the bone marrow was 29.9\% and 39.7\%
   of the capsule area on the P- and P+ sides, respectively. In the test
   capsules with the growth factor gel and placed on the P-sides, the
   amounts of new bone ranged from 5.6\% to 6.3\%, which were similar (p >
   0.05) to that formed in the capsules filled with the methyl cellulose
   gel (5.5\%). New bone formation was larger in the capsules on the P+
   sides than in those on the P- sides but was similar in the capsules with
   different growth factor concentrations (range 17.9-19.6\%) and in those
   with placebo gel (21.0\%). In all groups, the carrier gel was poorly
   absorbed and occupied most of the capsules.
   Local application of a methyl cellulose gel obstructed bone formation
   under Teflon capsules placed adjacent to uninjured cortical bone in the
   mandibular ramus of rats. These data suggest that another material
   should be utilized to deliver growth factors under Teflon membranes for
   guided bone regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effect of Bio-Oss((R)) with and without the local
   application of recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor
   (rhPDGF-BB) on bone formation under Teflon capsules.
   Eight male, 6-month-old, Wistar strain rats were used in the study. In
   each animal, the lateral aspect of the mandibular ramus was exposed and
   small perforations were produced in the bone. A rigid, non-porous
   hemispherical teflon capsule (diameter 7 mm) was placed on the ramus in
   both sides of the animals. The capsule placed on the one side of the jaw
   was filled with Bio-Oss((R)) granules soaked in a solution of PDGF-BB
   (20 mu g/capsule) and autogenous blood prior to placement. The capsules
   placed on the other side of the jaw were filled with Bio-Oss((R))
   granules soaked in autogenous blood only (controls). Four rats were
   sacrificed after 3 months and the remaining four after 5 months.
   Undecalcified sections containing the capsule and surrounding tissues
   were prepared and analysed in the microscope.
   Histologic analysis revealed limited amounts of bone formation. Most of
   the space underneath the capsules was occupied by Bio-Oss((R)) particles
   surrounded by fibrovascular connective tissue. Given the small sample
   size statistical analysis was not possible, however, the mean amount of
   mineralized new bone in the control group (20.8\%) appeared to be larger
   than that in the test group (6.7\%). After 5 months the amount of newly
   formed bone appeared similar in the two groups (23.0\% test, 26.0\%
   controls). The Bio-Oss((R)) particles occupied between 31.4\% and 41.1\%
   of the capsule area at 3 months and between 34.0\% and 34.7\% at 5
   months. Only particles adjacent to the mandibular ramus were
   incorporated in newly formed bone.
   Limited bone formation was present in the capsules grafted with
   Bio-Oss((R)) with or without the growth factor.}},

Abstract = {{Background. This survey was performed to determine the patterns of
   surgical care provided patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma
   (NSCLC).
   Methods. In 2001, the American College of Surgeons carried out a patient
   care survey of 729 hospitals to retrieve information of NSCLC patients'
   history, evaluation, pathology, and surgical treatment.
   Results. Inclusion criteria were met by 40,090 patients: of whom 11,668
   (29.1\%) were treated surgically; 74.2\% alone and 25.8\% as part of
   multimodality therapy. Of these patients, 59.5\% were in stage I, 17.5\%
   in stage II, 17.0\% in stage III, and 6.0\% in stage IV. Surgery patient
   demographics were the following: 55\% male and 45\% female; 46.8\% 70
   years or older; and 76.3\% had significant comorbidities. Tumor
   characteristics: squamous 28\%, adenocarcinoma 37.6\%, other 34.4\%.
   Staging: in addition to radiologic examinations, preoperative
   mediastinoscopy was performed in 27.1\% of operated patients with node
   biopsy in only 46.6\% of these procedures. Operations: wedge resection
   15.6\%, lobectomy 70.8\%, pneumonectomy 13.6\%. Surgical margins were
   positive in 7.8\%, but only 65.2\% had frozen section analysis.
   Perioperative mortality was 5.2\%, but was 4.0\% in nontransfused
   patients and 12.7\% in transfused patients and was 3.2\% in high-volume
   (more than 90 operations per year) versus 4.8\% in low-volume hospitals
   (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions. (1) Patients being operated for NSCLC are elderly with
   significant cornorbid conditions. (2) More patients than previously are
   female and have adenocarcinoma. (3) Mediastinoscopy is infrequently
   performed and lymph nodes are biopsied in less than 50\% of them. (4)
   Lobectomy is the most common operation, and positive surgical margins
   are too frequent. (5) Operative mortality is reasonable but transfusion
   is a marker for increased risk and outcomes are superior in high-volume
   hospitals. (6) Hospitals with higher volume had fewer perioperative
   deaths.}},

Abstract = {{Comparisons of electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate characteristics of
   three representative species in response to temperature acclimation were
   studied. In toad (Bufo raddei), T wave had positive, negative and flat
   patterns, which was different from positive in lizard (Eremias
   multiocellata), blunt and broad in bird (Alectories magna). The duration
   of P-R interval, Q-T interval and QRS complex interval reduced with
   increasing temperature in toad, but the P-R and T-P intervals were
   affected mostly, the QRS and R-T intervals were relatively less affected
   in lizard. In the bird, the voltage of P, S and T wave scarcely changed,
   R wave increased slightly with temperature going up in the thermal
   neutral zone (20-35 degrees C), T and S waves tended to increase and P-S
   and S-T intervals shortened when temperature went below the neutral
   zone. Heart rate was high and relatively steady in bird, but changed
   linearly in relation to temperature in toad and lizard. The increasing
   of heart rate with temperature was mainly caused by the T-P interval
   shortened in lizard, but P-S and S-T intervals shortened in bird.
   Comparisons of ECG and heart rate characteristics of three

   phylogenetically based constraints on pacemaker rates, oxygen supply and

   anxiety, perceived stressors, and interpersonal dependency than did
   urban non-only children. No significant differences were found in the
   rural only- and non-only children. Low love awareness from parents and

Abstract = {{In the current paper, we report a facile template-free route for `mass
   production' of ZnS hollow spheres with nano- and submicro-sizes,
   employing thiocarbamide, (CH3COO)(2)Zn-2H2O and water as the raw
   materials. ZnS hollow spheres were obtained via hydrothermal reaction at
   140 degrees C for 5 It. XRD analysis showed that the as-prepared ZnS
   hollow spheres were of hexagonal phase structure. To the best of our
   knowledge, there were few reports on the preparation of hexagonal ZnS
   crystals under low temperature (< 300 degrees C) in the literature.
   Furthermore, there is no report on the hollow structure of hexagonal
   phase ZnS under such low temperature (140 degrees C). Experimental
   results showed that the amount of thiocarbamide in the reaction system
   had a great impact on the size, shape, and structure of the final
   product. On the basis of the experimental results and our previous work,
   a possible formation mechanism was suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The Ce-Zr colloid with a narrow particle size distribution was prepared
   by the sol-gel method and used as a washcoat of the Zn-Cr monolithic
   catalyst for methanol autothermal reforming to hydrogen. The particle
   size of the Ce-Zr colloid can be effectively adjusted by peptization
   treatment in order to obtain highly adhesive and uniform washcoat. TEM
   and XRD results confirmed that Ce-Zr solid solution was formed and the
   particle size of Ce-Zr composite oxide powder calcined at 1073 K was
   still maintained within 20 - 50 nm. To avoid coating flaking, different
   drying methods during coating process were investigated in details. The
   results indicated that the microwave method was more favorable for the
   drying of moisture in honeycomb channels, while the oven drying method
   caused washcoat severely cracking. The Zn-Cr/Ce-Zr monolithic catalyst
   was more stable than that of no Ce-Zr washcoat because of the unique
   redox property of Ce-Zr mixed oxide. The temperature of the catalyst bed
   indicated that Ce-Zr washcoat exhibited better energy match of
   exothermic reaction and endothermic reaction, avoiding the hot-spot and
   prohibiting active species sintering.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of the
   ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to the performance of a gradient-based
   minimization method for the problem of estimation of facies boundaries
   in history matching. The EnKF is a Monte Carlo method for data
   assimilation that uses an ensemble of reservoir models to represent and
   update the covariance of variables. In several published studies, it
   outperforms traditional history-matching algorithms in adaptability and
   efficiency.
   Because of the approximate nature of the EnKF, the realizations from one
   ensemble tend to underestimate uncertainty, especially for problems that
   are highly nonlinear. In this paper, the distributions of
   reservoir-model realizations from 20 independent ensembles are compared
   with the distributions from 20 randomized-maximum-likelihood (RML)
   realizations for a 2D waterflood model with one injector and four
   producers. RML is a gradient-based sampling method that generates one
   reservoir realization in each minimization of the objective function. It
   is an approximate sampling method, but its sampling properties are
   similar to the Markov-chain Monte Carlo (McMC) method on highly
   nonlinear problems and are relatively more efficient than McMC.
   Despite the nonlinear relationship between the data (such as production
   rates and facies observations) and the model variables, the EnKF was
   effective at history matching the production data. We find that the
   computational effort to generate 20 independent realizations was similar
   for the two methods, although the complexity of the code is
   substantially less for the EnKF.}},

Abstract = {{Both regional anesthesia and general anesthesia have been proposed to
   provide optimal ambulatory anesthesia. We searched MEDLINE and other
   databases for randomized controlled trials comparing regional anesthesia
   and general anesthesia in ambulatory surgery patients for meta-analysis.
   Only major conduction blocks were considered to be regional anesthesia.
   Regional anesthesia was further separated into central neuraxial block
   and peripheral nerve block. Fifteen (1003 patients) and 7 (359 patients)
   trials for central neuraxial block and peripheral nerve block were
   included in the meta-analysis. Both central neuraxial block and
   peripheral nerve block were associated with increased induction time,
   reduced pain scores, and decreased need for postanesthesia care unit
   analgesics. However, central neuraxial block was not associated with
   decreased postanesthesia care unit bypass or time or reduced nausea
   despite reduced analgesics, and it was associated with a 35-min increase
   in total ambulatory surgery unit time. In contrast, peripheral nerve
   block was associated with decreased postanesthesia care unit need and
   decreased nausea but, again, not with decreased ambulatory surgery unit
   time. This meta-analysis indicates potential advantages for regional
   anesthesia, such as decreased postanesthesia care unit use, nausea, and
   postoperative pain. Although these factors have been proposed to reduce
   ambulatory surgery unit stay, neither central neuraxial block nor
   peripheral nerve block were associated with reduced ambulatory surgery
   unit time. Other factors, such as unsuitable discharge criteria and
   limitations of meta-analysis, may explain this discrepancy.}},

Title = {{Effects of atorvastatin on the Th1/Th2 polarization of ongoing

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AUTOIMMUNITY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) in rats is it T
   cell-mediated disorder and the involvement of Th1/Th2 unbalance has been
   demonstrated. This Study was designed to test the hypothesis that
   3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor,
   atorvastatin, affects T cell-mediated autoimmunity through modulating
   the balance of Th1/Th2 and reduces the severity of EAM.
   Methods: Myocarditis was induced in 23 Lewis rats by injection of
   porcine cardiac myosin. High-dose (10 mg/kg/day) or low-dose (1
   mg/kg/day) atorvastatin or vehicle was administered orally for 3 weeks
   to rats with EAM at the same time Of irunnInization. Seven Lewis rats
   received neither immunization nor statins therapy were used as normal
   controls. On day 21 after immunization (the climax of inflammation),
   echocardiography was examined and the severity of myocarditis was
   evaluated by histopathological evaluation. The area ratio
   (affected/entire area percentage) of myocardial lesions was determined
   in histological sections. Heart weight/body weight ratio was determined
   and the serum lipid levels were measured. Levels of serum IFN-gamma,
   IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 were Measured by ELISA.
   Results: Cardiac function was improved in the two atorvastatin-treated
   groups compared to the untreated group. Heart weight/body weight ratio
   and the degree of inflammation were significantly lower in the two
   dosage statin-treated groups than that in the untreated one.
   Furthermore, treatment with atorvastatin decreased the expression levels
   of Th1 cytokine (IFN-gamma and IL-2), and increased the expression
   levels of Th2 cytokine (IL-4 and IL-10). Atorvastatin attenuated the
   histopathological severity of myocarditis. Plasma lipid levels did not
   differ between the groups.
   Conclusions: Atorvastatin ameliorates EAM by inhibiting T cell responses
   and suppressing Th1-type and inflammatory cytokines production and this
   activity is independent of cholesterol reduction, whereas Th2-type
   cytokines production was promoted. Atorvastatin may have beneficial
   effects on myocarditis by modulating the Th1/Th2 balance. These results
   demonstrate an important role of Th1/Th2 polarization in the
   pathogenesis of EAM and suggest that HMG-CoA reductase blockade may be a
   promising new strategy for the treatment of organ specific autoimmune
   diseases. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   19992000 and GIS combined with the natural and socio-economic data, this
   paper drew an integrated zonation of the cropland change and its driving
   forces in China. The results indicated that the cropland change in the
   study period was constrained by geographical factors and driven by
   climate change as well as socio-economic system. Moreover, the regional
   differences of the drivels for cropland change were significant. In the
   midwest of China, natural condition changes and geographical background
   were the main constraints and drivers, while in Eastern China, social
   and economic changes and economic policies were the main driving forces.
   The cropland loss was nationwide. The dominant factors to cause this
   decrease included buildup of developing area to attract foreign capital
   and technologies, changes of industry structure due to urban influence,
   the change of employment notions thanks to living standard improvement,
   rapid urbanization due to the expansion of cities and towns, the
   diminished farming net income partly because of the global warming
   effects, and the rapid economic growth stimulated by the convenient
   transportation system. These factors interact and interdepend with each
   other to cause the cropland loss in China recently. The reasons for the
   increase of cropland were primarily the cultivation and deforestation by
   the farmers who want to increase income. This study on the mechnism of
   LUCC relied on the cropland change integrated classification considering
   the: natural or human factors both inside and outside the region, which
   provides a new approach to study the integrated regionalization and LUCC
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of pre-tension and torsion angle on the torsion fatigue
   lifetimes of high performance fibers (HPFs), including three p-aramid
   fibers (Twaron (R) 2000, Kevlar (R) 29 and Kevlar (R) 129) and ultra
   high molecular weight polyethylene fiber (UHMW-PE), were studied by
   means of a self-made torsion fatigue tester. The torsion fatigue
   performance of the HPFs were characterized and compared. The
   fracture-end morphology of these fibers after the fatigue tests was
   observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to seek to explain the
   fracture mechanism of the fiber fatigue. The experimental results
   indicate that there was a linear relationship between the logarithm of
   the fatigue lifetime and the pre-tension or torsion angle for the high
   performance p-aramid fibers, and the order of torsional fatigue lifetime
   for the four fibers was UHMW-PE > Kevlar (R) 129 > Kevlar (R) 29 >
   Twaron (R) 2000. Furthermore, the torsion-to-rupture test showed that
   the property of torsion to rupture relies on the twist transfer along
   the fibers, and the degree of twist transfer (DTT) for the UHMW-PE and
   aramid fibers was also in the order of UHMW-PE > Kevlar (R) 129 > Kevlar

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: To better understand the differences between in vivo (IVO)
   and in vitro (IVM) matured oocytes, we studied the chronological changes
   in cortical granule (CG) distribution and nuclear progression during
   maturation, and the competence of CG release and embryo development of
   mouse oocytes matured under different conditions. METHODS: Oocytes
   matured in vivo or in different culture media were used and CG
   distribution and release were assessed by fluorescein
   isothiocyanate-labelled Lens culinaris agglutinin and laser confocal
   microscopy. RESULTS: Tempos of nuclear maturation and CG redistribution
   were slower, and competence for CG exocytosis, cleavage and blastulation
   were lower in the IVM oocytes than in the IVO oocytes. These parameters
   also differed among oocytes matured in different culture media.
   Hypoxanthine (HX, 4 mM) blocked germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD),
   postponed CG migration and prevented CG-free domain (CGFD) formation.
   Cycloheximide (CHX) facilitated both GVBD and CG migration, but
   inhibited CGFD formation. The presence of serum in maturation media
   enhanced CG release after aging or activation of oocytes. Maintenance of
   germinal vesicle intact for some time by a trace amount (0.18 mM) of HX
   was beneficial to oocyte cytoplasmic maturation. CONCLUSION: CGs behaved
   differently in mouse oocytes matured under different conditions, and
   cytoplasmic maturity was not fully achieved in the IVM oocytes.}},

Abstract = {{Beluga whales have been hunted for food by Native People in the Canadian
   Arctic since prehistoric time. Here we report the results of analyses of
   total mercury in samples of liver, kidney, muscle and muktuk from
   collections over the period 1981-2002. We compare these results with
   human consumption guidelines and examine temporal and geographic
   variation. Liver has been analyzed more frequently than other organs and
   it has been used as the indicator organ. Mercury accumulates in the
   liver of the whales over time so that the whale ages are usually linked
   statistically to their levels of mercury in liver. Virtually all the
   samples of 566 animals analyzed contained mercury in liver at
   concentrations higher than the Canadian consumption guideline of 0.5 mu
   g g(-1) (wet weight) for fish. (There is no regulatory guideline for
   concentrations in marine mammals in Canada.) Samples from locations in
   the Mackenzie Delta in the western Canadian Arctic and from Pangnirtung
   in the eastern Canadian Arctic were obtained more often than from other
   location and these offered the best chances to determine whether levels
   have changed over time. Statistical outlier points were removed and the
   regressions of (In) mercury in liver on age were used to calculate the
   level of mercury in whales of age 13.1 years in order to compare
   age-adjusted levels at different locations. These age-adjusted levels
   and also the slopes of regressions suggested that levels have increased
   in the Mackenzie Delta over the sampling period although not in a simple
   linear fashion. Other locations had fewer collections, generally spread
   over fewer years. Some of them indicated differences between sampling
   times but we could not establish whether these differences were simply
   temporal variation or whether they were segments of a consistent trend.
   For example, the levels in whales from Arviat were considerably higher
   in 1999 than in 1984 but we have only two samples. Similarly, samples
   from Iqaluit in 1994 exceeded considerably those in 1993 and the
   interval seems too short to reflect any regional temporal trend and more
   likely represent an extreme case of year-to-year variation. Previous
   analyses of data from geographically distinct groups had suggested that
   whales in the western Canadian Arctic had higher levels of mercury than
   those from the eastern Canadian Arctic. The present analysis suggests
   that such regional differences have diminished and are no longer
   statistically significant. No site has indicated significant decreases
   in more recent samples. The levels of total mercury in the most analyzed
   organs fell in the order of liver (highest levels), kidney, muscle and
   muktuk (lowest level). While muktuk had the lowest level of the organs
   most frequently analyzed, it is the preferred food item from these
   whales and it still exceeded the consumption guideline in most
   instances. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case history for the construction of the Pappadai
   dam in Italy. The dam is constructed from rockfill, with an upstream
   bituminous membrane, and is built on stiff clay foundations. The
   instrumentation of the dam and of the foundation soil provides detailed
   insight into the deformation patterns and pore-water pressure changes
   during dam construction and for the subsequent 7 years. Two-dimensional
   plane-strain finite element analyses, using fairly simple constitutive
   models for soil and rockfill behaviour, were performed to reproduce the
   soil-structure interaction so that the effects of reservoir impoundment,
   which has yet to be carried out, could be investigated. The paper shows
   that a careful choice of parameters and an understanding of the
   mechanical behaviour of the in situ soils can result in satisfactory
   predictions of the overall soil-structure interaction.}},

Abstract = {{I present a description of the nest, eggs, and nestlings of the
   Pale-eyed Thrush (Platycichla leucops). In addition, I present data on
   nest temperatures and incubation patterns. Two cup-shaped nests were
   found at a cloud forest site in the Central Andes of Colombia, both made
   of moss and containing two greenish-colored eggs with brown blotches.
   Generally, the incubating female spent the night on the nest. She left
   the nest at dawn, returned several times during the day and at dusk.
   Only the female incubated, but the male helped feed the nestlings. Nest
   temperature varied during incubation between 24 degrees and 27 degrees
   C, which was several degrees above ambient temperature. There were
   differences between the two nests in the rate of cooling after the
   female left the nest at dawn, probably related to nest placement. Nest
   microclimate was affected by microhabitat and adult incubation behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Although states have had difficulty extending Medicaid managed
   care (MMC) to rural areas, rural models of capitated MMC are expected to
   grow in response to new federal regulations and the serious budget
   problems facing nearly all states. As such, understanding the effects of
   capitated MMC in rural settings is important for policy considerations.
   Purpose: To evaluate the effects of capitated MMC on beneficiary access
   and use in rural Minnesota. Methods: We took advantage of delays in the
   timing of the introduction of MMC across rural counties in Minnesota to
   estimate the effects of managed care on adults and children under
   Medicaid using a difference-in-differences framework. Findings: We found
   that Minnesota's shift from fee-for-service Medicaid to MMC in its rural
   counties had little effect on access to health care for either adults or
   children. Conclusions: Because Minnesota reports that Medicaid costs
   under MMC are below expected costs under FFS Medicaid, it appears that
   the primary accomplishment of Minnesota's rural MMC initiative is one of
   cost savings: MMC provides the same access to care as FFS Medicaid, but
   at lower cost. With steep budget deficits in nearly all states, other
   states may want to consider Minnesota's rural MMC model as a mechanism
   for reducing their Medicaid costs.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. Studies investigating determinants of ball release speed have
   examined the technique and anthropometry of fast bowlers with little
   work being done on muscular strength. The aim of our study was to
   determine whether knee biomechanics during bowling and strength of the
   shoulder and knee could predict ball release speed.
   Methods. Twelve cricketers, aged 16.6 +/- 0.7) years, from schools in
   Johannesburg, South Africa, volunteered for the study. Subjects were
   fast-medium bowlers (mean ball release speed of 29.2 +/- 1.8 m(.)s(-1))
   and had been bowling for at least 5 years. Three accurate deliveries
   were filmed on an outdoor cricket pitch, in the sagittal plane with a
   high-speed digital camera recording at 250 frames per second. The mean
   ball release speed, knee angle at ball release and knee angle at front
   foot strike were determined using simple two-dimensional kinematics. On
   a separate day, peak concentric isokinetic muscle torque was measured
   for both knees and the dominant shoulder.
   Results. Ball release speed was positively correlated to a straight knee
   at front foot strike (r=0.72, P=0.009) and at ball release (r=0.71,
   P=0.011). No significant correlation was found between ball release
   speed and any of the peak torque values (knee extension peak torque,
   r=-0.11, knee flexion peak torque, r=-0.08, shoulder internal rotation
   peak torque, r=0.21 and shoulder external rotation, r=0.29, P > 0.05). A
   multiple regression model using knee angle at front foot strike and at
   ball release, and the angle at which peak torque is generated during
   shoulder internal and external rotation, predicted ball release speed
   (adjusted r(2)=0.85, P < 0.002).
   Conclusion. We have confirmed that the angle of the front knee at the
   beginning and end of a delivery is an important correlate of ball
   release speed in schoolboy fast-medium bowlers. In addition we have also
   demonstrated that a multiple regression model based on knee kinematics
   and shoulder peak torque angles can be used to predict ball release
   speed.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of melt temperature, ultrasonic oscillations, and induced
   ultrasonic oscillations modes on weld line strength of polystyrene (PS)
   and polystyrene/polyethylene (PS/HDPE) (90/10) blend was investigated.
   The results show that the increase of melt temperature is beneficial to
   the increase of weld line strength of PS and PS/HDPE blend. Compared
   with PS, the increase of melt temperature can greatly enhance the
   strength of PS/HDPE blends. For PS, the presence of ultrasonic
   oscillations can enhance the weld line strength of PS at different melt
   temperatures. But for PS/HDIPE blends, the presence of ultrasonic
   oscillations can improve the weld line strength when the melt
   temperature is 230 degrees C, but when the melt temperature is 195
   degrees C, the induced ultrasonic oscillations hardly enhance the weld
   line strength. Compared with Mode I (ultrasonic oscillations were
   induced into the mold at the whole process of injection molding), the
   induced ultrasonic oscillations as Mode II (ultrasonic oscillations were
   induced into the mold after injection mold filling) is more effective at
   increasing the weld line strength of PS and PS/HDPE blends. The
   mechanism for ultrasonic improvement of weld line strength was also

Abstract = {{Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease, leaving the
   patient in a partially or completely deafferented state. In an
   explorative study, we investigated responses to visual socio-emotional
   stimuli in ALS patients. Pictures from the International Affective
   Picture System (IAPS) were verbally judged by 12 moderately affected ALS
   patients with a spinal onset and a slow progression and 18 age-matched
   controls, and data were compared with psychophysiological responses.
   Verbal emotional judgments of patients were more positive than ratings
   of controls. Regarding arousal, patients neutralized extreme pictures,
   in that they rated calm pictures as more exciting than controls and
   exciting pictures as more calm. These changes of emotional processing
   were unrelated to depression or frontal lobe dysfunction. There were no
   major differences between patients and controls concerning physiological
   responses to emotional stimuli. We conclude that emotional responses of
   ALS patients tend to be altered towards positive valence and towards a
   more balanced arousal state in early stages of the disease. These
   findings contradict assumptions of a generally negative impact of the
   disease on the emotional disposition and may indicate compensatory
   cognitive or neuroplastic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Computation of load flows is the most fundamental power system operation
   and planning problem. In order to improve its operation efficiency and
   enhance real-time control and just-in-time decision support, in this
   paper, we first present an accelerated algorithm as the generalization
   of the Aitken's algorithm ({[}14]) for nonlinear equations, which is
   suitable for accelerating all kinds of iterative algorithms. And then we
   prove that the accelerated formula converges quadratically. Furthermore,
   combining the accelerated algorithm with parallel algorithm, two
   completely parallel algorithms for the load flow equations are proposed.
   In order to explain the advantages, the tests of the two new methods are
   performed on the IEEE 118-bus system and the IEEE 662-bus system. The
   comparison with the Newton method and the simplified Newton method is
   also presented. The numerical results show that the new methods
   presented by us can achieve good performance. So it provides feasible
   parallel methods for solving large load flow equations.}},

Abstract = {{For the purpose of evaluating the use of Yb-169 for prostate High Dose
   Rate brachytherapy (HDR), a hypothetical Yb-169 source is assumed with
   the exact same design of the new microSelectron source replacing the
   Ir-192 active core by pure Yb-169 metal. Monte Carlo simulation is
   employed for the full dosimetric characterization of both sources and
   results are compared following the AAPM TG-43 dosimetric formalism.
   Monte Carlo calculated dosimetry results are incorporated in a
   commercially available treatment planning system (SWIFT (TM)), which
   features an inverse treatment planning option based on a multiobjective
   dose optimization engine. The quality of prostate HDR brachytherapy
   using the real Ir-192 and hypothetical Yb-169 source is compared in a
   comprehensive analysis of different prostate implants in terms of the
   multiobjective dose optimization solutions as well as treatment quality
   indices such as Dose Volume Histograms (DVH) and the Conformal Index
   (COIN). Given that scattering overcompensates for absorption in
   intermediate photon energies and distances in the range of interest to
   prostate HDR brachytherapy. Yb-169 proves at least equivalent to Ir-192
   irrespective of prostate volume. This has to be evaluated in view of the
   shielding requirements for the Yb-169 energies that are minimal relative
   to that for Ir-192. (c) 2005 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a multifactorial disease in which
   environmental triggers interact with genetic variants in the
   predisposition to the disease. A number of common variants have been
   associated with T2D but our knowledge of their ability to predict T2D
   prospectively is limited.
   Methods and Findings By using a Cox proportional hazard model, common
   variants in the PPARG (P12A), CAPN10 (SNP43 and 44), KCNJ11 (E23K), UCP2
   (-866G > A), and IRS1 (G972R) genes were studied for their ability to
   predict T2D in 2,293 individuals participating in the Botnia study in
   Finland. After a median follow-up of 6 y, 132 (6\%) persons developed
   T2D. The hazard ratio for risk of developing T2D was 1.7 (95\%
   confidence interval {[}Cl] 1.1-2.7) for the PPARG PP genotype, 1.5 (95\%
   Cl 1.0-2.2) for the CAPN10 SNP44 TT genotype, and 2.6 (95\% Cl 1.5-4.5)
   for the combination of PPARG and CAPN10 risk genotypes. In individuals
   with fasting plasma glucose >= 5.6 mmol/l and body mass index >= 30
   kg/m(2), the hazard ratio increased to 21.2 (95\% Cl 8.751.4) for the
   combination of the PPARG PP and CAPN10 SNP43/44 GG/17 genotypes as
   compared to those with the low-risk genotypes with normal fasting plasma
   glucose and body mass index < 30 kg/m(2).
   Conclusion We demonstrate in a large prospective study that variants in
   the PPARG and CAPN10 genes predict future T2D. Genetic testing might
   become a future approach to identify individuals at risk of developing
   T2D.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has a high prevalence in
   women and is often associated with insulin resistance and hence with
   aspects of the so-called metabolic syndrome.
   Methods: Ten women diagnosed with PCOS were consecutively included (aged
   21-39 years, average 30.2 +/- 1.9 years: body mass index 28.4-42.5
   kg/m(2), average 37.5 +/- 1.7 kg/m(2) (mean +/- S.E.)). Adipocytes were
   isolated from the subcutaneous fat and, after overnight incubation to
   recover from insulin resistance due to the surgical cell isolation
   procedures, they were analyzed for insulin sensitivity.
   Results: The patients with PCOS exhibited marked clinical
   hyperinsulinemia with 3.6-fold higher blood levels of C-peptide than a
   healthy lean control group (1.7 +/- 0.2 and 0.5 +/- 0.02 nmol/l
   respectively, P < 0.0001). The patients with PCOS also exhibited
   2.4-fold higher concentrations of serum triacylglycerol (2.1 +/- 0.3 and
   0.9 +/- 0.06 mmol/l respectively, P < 0.0001), but only slightly
   elevated blood pressure (118 +/- 12/76 +/- 6 and 113 +/- 7/72 +/- 6 mmHg
   respectively, P = 0.055/0.046). However, insulin sensitivity for
   stimulation of glucose transport in the isolated adipocytes was
   indistinguishable from a non-PCOS, non-diabetic control group, while the
   maximal insulin effect on glucose uptake was significantly lower (2.2
   +/- 0.2- and 3.8 +/- 0.8-fold respectively, P = 0.02).
   Conclusions: Subcutaneous adipocytes from patients with PCOS do not
   display reduced insulin sensitivity. The findings show that the insulin
   resistance of PCOS is qualitatively different from that of type 2
   diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Signal transduction is vitally important for development and cell
   survival of all animals. Most of signaling processes involve
   phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of amino acid residues in
   proteins. The kinases and phosphatases involved in signaling processes
   are regulated by different mechanisms. So far, the studies on protein
   phosphorylation almost exclusively limited to protein serine/threonine
   and tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of histidine has only been
   sparsely reported. However, phosphorylation of histidine residues has
   been extensively studied in prokaryotes. It is estimated that histidine
   phosphorylation may account for 6\% of total protein phosphorylation in
   eukaryotes, 10- to-100-fold more than phosphotyrosine, though less
   abundant than phosphoserine. Although the presence of phosphohistidine
   in vertebrate protein was described as early as in the 1960s,
   accumulated knowledge in vertebrates so far is still limited to
   O-phosphates. The protein phosphatases were introduced, and the
   knowledge on the key mechanisms of the bacterial two-component system
   was summarized. Most importantly, novel mechanisms of phosphorylation
   and dephosphorylation of histidine residues are described. Finally, the
   recent studies about histidine phosphatases are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we investigated the esterase-like activity of
   human serum albumin (HSA) and the mechanism by which it hydrolyzes, and
   thereby activates, olmesartan medoxomil (CS-866), a novel angiotensin II
   receptor antagonist. CS-866 has previously been shown to be rapidly
   hydrolyzed in serum in which HSA appeared to play the most important
   role in catalyzing the hydrolysis. We found that the hydrolysis of
   CS-866 by HSA followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Compared with the
   release of p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA), CS-866
   showed lower affinity to HSA and a lower catalytic rate of hydrolysis.
   Thermodynamic data indicated that PNPA has a smaller value of activation
   entropy (Delta S) than CS-866; consequently, PNPA is more reactive than
   CS-866. Ibuprofen and warfarin acted as competitive inhibitors of
   hydrolysis of CS-866, whereas dansyl-L-asparagine, n-butyl
   p-aminobenzoate, and diazepam did not. These findings suggest that the
   hydrolytic activity is associated to parts of site I and site II for
   ligand binding. All chemically modified HSA derivatives (Tyr-, Lys-,
   His-, and Trp-modifications) had significantly lower reactivity than
   native HSA; Lys- HSA and Trp-HSA had especially low reactivity. All the
   mutant HSAs tested (K199A, W214A, and Y411A) exhibited a significant
   decrease in reactivity, suggesting that Lys-199, Trp-214, and Tyr-411
   play important roles in the hydrolysis. Results obtained using a
   computer docking model are in agreement with the experimental results,
   and strongly support the hypotheses that we derived from the
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The diagnosis of Lyme disease in the presence of an acute
   optical neuritis always raises a difficult diagnostic problem. We
   present a case of Lyme-associated Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy
   (LHON).
   Observation: A 17-year-old Eurasian young man presented with left-eye
   visual impairment for 1 month. This loss of vision acuity in the left
   eye is related to an optic neuropathy. Mitochondrial DNA testing showed
   a G to A substitution at position 11778 confirming a diagnosis of LHON.
   The family history disclosed a case of LHON in a maternal cousin. The
   mother's family is Asian. Besides, serum examination of anti-Borrelia
   antibodies was performed and was positive against Borrelia burgdorferi
   garinii. The patient history indicated that he had been possessing a dog
   and was living in an endemic area of Lyme disease. But he did not recall
   receiving a tick bite nor having any erythema chronicum migrans. Initial
   examination showed bilateral green-red axis colour vision defects which
   made us fear bilateralisation of the optic neuropathy, which occurred 2
   months later (that is 3 months after the onset of symptoms on the left
   eye). An antibiotic treatment by ceftriaxone was administered for 4
   weeks all in all; and a long term ubidecarenone therapy was established.
   At present, after a 1-year follow up, the eyes' conditions remains
   unchanged.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this would be the first case reporting
   such an association, in which we can discuss the fortuitous character or
   the role of the infectious factor in the developing of the mitochondrial
   pathology. This observation also raises the problem of the positive
   diagnosis of Lyme disease when tick bite and erythema are absent or
   underestimated.}},

Abstract = {{The role of diversity in buffering environmental change remains poorly
   tested in natural systems. Diversity might enhance stability if
   different species have different disturbance susceptibilities (i.e.,
   functional complementarity). Alternatively, diversity might decrease
   stability because, at high diversity, populations are predicted to be
   more temporally variable and therefore more vulnerable to extinction
   following perturbation. There is theoretical support for both hypotheses
   but limited empirical evidence. I examine these issues with experimental
   burning along a natural diversity gradient in a savanna where fire has
   been suppressed for 150 years. I examined how two components of
   stability, resistance (invasion by added and naturally recruiting
   species) and resilience (recovery of the predisturbance light levels,
   the primary limiting resource in this system), varied with diversity. I
   also examined how the abundance of dominant species and soil depth
   affected stability, as both are negatively correlated with diversity and
   could have hidden impacts (e.g., invasion resistance on shallow soils
   correlated with diversity but caused by moisture stress). Species-rich
   communities were stable because they contained fire-tolerant species
   that, despite their rarity, significantly increased in cover after fire,
   reduced light availability, and limited seedling survival. Species-poor
   communities were rapidly invaded, apparently due to the combined effects
   of (1) trade-offs between competitive ability and disturbance tolerance
   (dominants in species-poor areas were competitive but fire sensitive),
   and (2) low functional complementarity. Colonization by woody plants was
   also significantly higher in low-diversity plots; these species are
   known to form a new stable state that excludes all savanna taxa. The
   abundance of dominants and soil depth were negatively correlated with
   diversity because they appear to determine its spatial variation in the
   absence of fire, but diversity alone accounted for variation in
   stability. Without burning, most subordinates are confined to shallower
   soils where they play a minor role in controlling resource flows and
   production. Diversity, therefore, was more important for buffering the
   effects of change than controlling ecosystem function under undisturbed
   conditions. If applicable to other systems, the results indicate that
   species loss will compound the negative effects of environmental change
   on ecosystem function by limiting the ability of ecosystems to respond.}},

Abstract = {{There has been little serious work to integrate the constructionist
   approach and the cognitive/evolutionary approach in the domain of race,
   although many researchers have paid lip service to this project. We
   believe that any satisfactory account of human beings' racialist
   cognition has to integrate both approaches. In this paper, we propose to
   move toward this integration. We present an evolutionary hypothesis that
   rests on a distinction between three kinds of groups-kin-based groups,
   small scale coalitions, and ethnies. Following Gil-White (1999,-2001a,
   2001b), we propose that ethnies have raised specific evolutionary
   challenges that were solved by an evolved cognitive system. We suggest
   that the concept of race is a byproduct of this mechanism. We argue that
   recent theories of cultural transmission are our best hope for
   integrating social constructionists' and cognitive/evolutionary
   theorists' insights.}},

Abstract = {{The Notch signaling pathway has pleiotropic functions during mammalian
   embryogenesis. It is required for the patterning and differentiation of
   the presomitic and somitic paraxial mesoderm and of the neural tube. We
   used DNA-chip expression profiling and 2D-gel electrophoresis combined
   with peptide mass fingerprinting to identify genes and proteins
   differentially regulated in E10.5 Dll1 (delta-like 1, Delta1) mutant
   embryos. The differential expression profiling approach identified 47
   regulated transcripts and 40 differentially expressed proteins. The
   majority of these genes has until now not been associated with Notch
   signaling. Subsequent whole-mount in situ hybridization confirmed that a
   subset of the identified transcripts has restricted and distinct
   patterns of expression in E10.5 mouse embryos. For most genes these
   expression patterns were affected in the presomitic mesoderm, in
   differentiating somites of Dll1 mutant embryos and in the neural tube
   and cells differentiating from it. Similar effects were observed in
   embryos homozygous for the Headturner (Htu) and pudgy (pu) mutations,
   which are alleles of the Notch ligands Jag1 and Dll3. The regulated
   expression of a subset of the proteins was validated by immunoblots.
   Remarkably six of the proteins down-regulated in Dll1 mutant embryos are
   proteasome subunits. The large set of regulated genes identified in this
   differential expression profiling approach is an important resource for
   further functional studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Among all species analyzed, the domestic pig seems to be the most
   appropriate organ donor for xenotransplantation. Porcine endogenous
   retroviruses (PERVs) are present in genomes of all pigs and are capable
   of infecting human cells in vitro thus posing a serious threat for
   xenotransplantation procedures. Despite the abundant distribution of
   PERVs integrated with porcine genome, the majority of PERV proviral DNA
   is not capable of expressing viral proteins unless seriously mutated.
   The aim of the study was to analyze PERV genome for mutations. The study
   was performed on blood samples from 146 pigs. Long-range polymerase
   chain reaction (Long-PCR) was performed with primer sets designed within
   long terminal repeats (LTRs). Long-PCR products of different molecular
   weights were obtained: 530 by (33.1\% of individuals), 580 by (76.7\%),
   933 by (100\%), and 2900 by (59.8\%). Amplimers of 7200 by were absent
   in 12.8\% of individuals, indicating the lack of intact proviral DNA.
   Sequence analysis showed that most PERV proviral DNA was significantly
   mutated, thus suggesting the inability to express functional viral RNA;
   however, it cannot be ruled out that compensatory recombination
   processes could occur enabling replication of defective proviruses.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated observations are presented of water property evolution and
   turbulent microstructure during the spring restratification period of
   April and May 1997 on the New England continental shelf. Turbulence is
   shown to be related to surface mixed layer entrainment and shear from
   low-mode near-inertial internal waves. The largest turbulent diapycnal
   diffusivity and associated buoyancy fluxes were found at the bottom of
   an actively entraining and highly variable wind-driven surface mixed
   layer. Away from surface and bottom boundary layers, turbulence was
   systematically correlated with internal wave shear, though the nature of
   that relationship underwent a regime shift as the stratification
   strengthened. During the first week, while stratification was weak, the
   largest turbulent dissipation away from boundaries was coincident with
   shear from mode-1 near-inertial waves generated by passing storms.
   Wave-induced Richardson numbers well below 0.25 and density overturning
   scales of several meters were observed. Turbulent dissipation rates in
   the region of peak shear were consistent in magnitude with several
   dimensional scalings. The associated average diapycnal diffusivity
   exceeded 10(-3) m(2) s(-1). As stratification tripled, Richardson
   numbers from low-mode internal waves were no longer critical, though
   turbulence was still consistently elevated in patches of wave shear.
   Kinematically, dissipation during this period was consistent with the
   turbulence parameterization proposed by MacKinnon and Gregg, based on a
   reinterpretation of wave-wave interaction theory. The observed growth of
   temperature gradients was, in turn, consistent with a simple
   one-dimensional model that vertically distributed surface heat fluxes
   commensurate with calculated turbulent diffusivities.}},

Abstract = {{The lipids and proteins of biomembranes exhibit highly dissimilar
   conformations, geometrical shapes, amphipathicity, and thermodynamic
   properties which constrain their two-dimensional molecular packing,
   electrostatics, and interaction preferences. This causes inevitable
   development of large local tensions that frequently relax into phase or
   compositional immiscibility along lateral and transverse planes of the
   membrane. On the other hand, these effects constitute the very codes
   that mediate molecular and structural changes determining and
   controlling the possibilities for enzymatic activity, apposition and
   recombination in biomembranes. The presence of proteins constitutes a
   major perturbing factor for the membrane sculpturing both in terms of
   its surface topography and dynamics. We will focus on some results from
   our group within this context and summarize some recent evidence for the
   active involvement of extrinsic (myelin basic protein), integral
   (Folch-Lees proteolipid protein) and amphitropic (c-Fos and c-Jun)
   proteins, as well as a membrane-active amphitropic phosphohydrolytic

Abstract = {{Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterized by
   unexplained and prolonged fatigue that is often accompanied by
   abnormalities of immune, endocrine and cognitive functions. Diminished
   natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) is a frequently reported
   finding. However, the molecular basis of this defect of in vitro
   cytotoxicy has not been described. Perforin is a protein found within
   intracellular granules of NK and cytotoxic T cells and is a key factor
   in the lytic processes mediated by these cells. Quantitative
   fluorescence flow cytometry was used to the intracellular perforin
   content in CFS subjects and healthy controls. A significant reduction in
   the NK cell associated perforin levels in samples from CFS patients,
   compared to healthy controls, was observed. There was also an indication
   of a reduced perforin level within the cytotoxic T cells of CFS
   subjects, providing the first evidence, to our knowledge, to suggest a T
   cell associated cytotoxic deficit in CFS. Because perforin is important
   in immune surveillance and homeostasis of the immune system, its
   deficiency may prove to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of
   CFS and its analysis may prove useful as a biomarker in the study of
   CFS.}},

Abstract = {{Rebamipide has a broad spectrum of pharmacological actions that include
   suppression of neutrophil functions and stimulation of mucosal
   epithelial cell regeneration by increasing the expression of epithelial
   growth factor (EGF) and the EGF receptor. Sixteen patients with active
   ulcerative colitis (UC. mild in 1 patient, moderate in 11, and severe in
   4) were recruited. Enemas containing 150 mg rebamipide per dosing were
   administered during the daytime after passage of stool, twice a day for
   4 weeks. UC disease activity index (UC-DAI), endoscopic activity index
   (EAI), and Floren's grading (FG) of mucosal biopsy specimens were
   measured at entry and at 4 weeks. Five of 16 patients did not complete
   the study, and therefore, final efficacy assessment was done on I I
   patients who completed the 4 weeks of treatment. Improvements were
   observed in UC-DAI (P = 0.0049), EAI (P = 0.0043), and FG (P = 0.0084).
   There was no serious rebamipide-related side effect in any of the 16
   patients. In conclusion, rebamipide topical therapy appears to be
   effective for the treatment of mildly to moderately active distal UC.
   Further controlled studies are warranted for this promising drug.}},

   Experience from large centers has shown it to be safe and effective. We

   Thirty-three patients received simultaneous pancreas and kidney
   transplants, 14 received isolated pancreas transplants, and 7 received a
   pancreas transplant after kidney transplantation. Biopsies were
   performed by pancreas transplantation surgeons with the assistance of
   radiologists under ultrasound guidance using an Acuson XP 128/10
   ultrasound machine. One hundred twenty allograft biopsies were performed
   in 54 patients. Twenty-seven (50\%) patients underwent multiple
   biopsies. In 102 (85\%) biopsies the specimens were adequate for
   examination. Eighteen (15\%) biopsy samples had no pancreatic tissue and
   showed surrounding fat and small bowel. 1 (1.8\%) patient bleeding
   developed that required transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood
   cells, but no surgical intervention was necessary. One (1.8\%) patient
   had a pancreatic fistula, which healed with nonoperative management.
   Biochemical evidence of pancreatitis was noted in 5 (9.2\%) patients,
   but none of these patients had clinical signs of pancreatitis.
   Percutaneous ultrasound-guided pancreas allograft biopsy is a safe
   procedure with a low complication rate and a high tissue yield for

Abstract = {{In aquatic ecosystems, the ecology of macrophytal detritus aggregations
   has been investigated over a range of temporal scales. Yet, no attempts
   have been made to minimize the temporal resolution of the analysis, thus
   neglecting the occurrence of short-term colonization and decay dynamics
   for these ephemeral patches of high biological activity. The present
   study was carried out at two sampling sites in Lake Alimini Grande, a
   brackish lagoon in South-East Italy. The abundance of macroinvertebrate
   taxa colonizing prepared packs of reed leaf detritus and the ash-free
   dry mass of the packs were monitored daily for 40 days. Spectral
   analysis was used to investigate the fine-scale temporal dynamics of
   invertebrates colonization and leaf pack mass variations. The
   macrobenthos found on leaf packs was dominated at both sites by few taxa
   (i.e., the vagile Lekanesphaera monodi, Microdeutopus gryllotalpa,
   Neanthes caudata and the sessile Balanus sp.), whose general
   colonization patterns were described by unimodal curves. At a daily
   temporal resolution Balanus sp. was characterized by random short-term
   density variations, while vagile taxa showed non-random, highly site-
   and species-specific fluctuations generally characterized by an
   oscillation period comprised between 2 and 3 days. In addition, leaf
   packs were characterized by non-random, short-term mass oscillations,
   coherent and in phase with L. monodi abundance fluctuations. Our results
   highlight the occurrence of short-term, non-random density variations of
   invertebrate colonizers on leaf detritus patches. In addition, they
   emphasize a previously unexplored, fine-scale linkage between abundance
   patterns of invertebrate consumers and short-term mass variations of
   decaying detritus.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-objective optimization formulation that reflects the
   multi-substrate optimization in a multi-product fermentation is proposed
   in this work. This formulation includes the application of
   epsilon-constraint to generate the trade-off solution for the
   enhancement of one selective product in a multi-product fermentation,
   with simultaneous minimization of the other product within a threshold
   limit. The formulation has been applied to the fed-batch fermentation of
   Aspergillus niger that produces a number of enzymes during the course of
   fermentation, and of these, catalase and protease enzyme expression have
   been chosen as the enzymes of interest. Also, this proposed formulation
   has been applied in the environment of three control variables, i.e. the
   feed rates of sucrose, nitrogen source and oxygen and a set of trade-off
   solutions have been generated to develop the paretooptimal curve. We
   have developed and experimentally evaluated the optimal control profiles
   for multiple substrate feed additions in the fed-batch fermentation of
   A. niger to maximize catalase expression along with protease expression
   within a threshold limit and vice versa. An increase of about 70\% final
   catalase and 31\% final protease compared to conventional fed-batch
   cultivation were obtained. Novel methods of oxygen supply through
   liquid-phase H2O2 addition have been used with a view to overcome
   limitations of aeration due to high gas-liquid transport resistance. The
   multi-objective optimization problem involved linearly appearing control
   variables and the decision space is constrained by state and end point
   constraints. The proposed multi-objective optimization is solved by
   differential evolution algorithm, a relatively superior population-based
   stochastic optimization strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of
   task-specificity on knee extensor steadiness adaptations in functionally
   limited older adults. Twenty-four functionally limited older adults
   (74.6 +/- 7.6 years: 22 women, 2 men) completed a 10-week control period
   followed by 10 weeks (2 days/week) of resistance (RT), functional (FT)
   (practicing everyday tasks, i.e., chair rises) or functional +
   resistance (FRT) training, which featured both shortening and
   lengthening movements. During testing, subjects performed a steady
   isometric {[}10, 25, 50\% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] and
   shortening/lengthening (5, 30, 65\% of MVC) knee extensor contractions.
   There were no steadiness (isometric, shortening or lengthening
   contractions) changes in the control period and no adaptations in
   isometric steadiness due to training. RT induced a 37\% reduction in
   shortening fluctuations at 5\% of MVC and 35\% reduction in lengthening
   fluctuations at both 30\% and 65\% of MVC. FRT induced a 60\% reduction
   in shortening fluctuations at 30\% of MVC. No adaptations in dynamic
   steadiness were observed in the FT group. Further analysis indicated
   that those who were the least steady at baseline showed the greatest
   training effects during isometric (RT: R-2 = 0.25, FRT: R-2 = 0.49, FT:
   R-2 = 0.38), shortening (RT: R-2 = 0.36, FT: R-2 = 0.35) and lengthening
   (RT: r(2) = 0.29, FRT: r(2) = 0.44) contractions. In conclusion,
   steadiness improvements in groups performing resistance exercise,
   without a concomitant improvement in the FT group, supports a role for
   task-specificity in explaining steadiness adaptations, particularly for
   unsteady older adults.}},

Abstract = {{The recently deployed Envisat satellite collected before- and
   after-event imagery on the Bam, Iran, earthquake that occurred on 26
   December 2003. The majority of buildings in Bam were traditional
   one-story unreinforced adobe structures constructed of the indigenous
   land material of the region. As a result, the corresponding SAR imagery
   for Bam reflects less material dependence on object detection. For this
   study, two sets of before and after SAR data are used from theASAR
   sensor onboard of the Envisat platform. The backscattering, complex
   coherence, self-power and cross-power values are computed for each
   respective co-registered data pairs. The change detection scheme
   evaluates these results using orbital information to assess the levels
   of change in different city zones. Such damage maps can potentially
   serve in disaster response/management and also in estimating economic
   losses (Eguchi et al. 2000 ). Damage maps from field observations are
   used to validate these findings.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We have recently reported that ligation of the CD44 cell surface antigen
   with A3D8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) triggers incomplete differentiation
   and apoptosis of the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived NB4
   cells. The present study characterizes the mechanisms underlying the
   apoptotic effect of A3D8 in NB4 cells. We show that A3D8 induces
   activation of both initiator caspase-8 and -9 and effector caspase-3 and
   -7 but only inhibition of caspase-3/7 and caspase-8 reduces A3D8-induced
   apoptosis. Moreover, A3D8 induces mitochondrial alterations (decrease in
   mitochondrial membrane potential Delta Psi(m) and cytochrome c release),
   which are reduced by caspase-8 inhibitor, suggesting that caspase-8 is
   primarily involved in A3D8-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells. However, the
   apoptotic process is independent of TNF-family death receptor
   signalling. Interestingly, the general serine protease inhibitor
   4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) decreases A3D8-induced
   apoptosis and when combined with general caspase inhibitor displays an
   additive effect resulting in complete prevention of apoptosis. These
   results suggest that both caspase-dependent and serine
   protease-dependent pathways contribute to A3D8-induced apoptosis.
   Finally, A3D8 induces apoptosis in all-trans-retinoic acid-resistant
   NB4-derived cells and in APL primary blasts, characterizing the A3D8
   anti-CD44 mAb as a novel class of apoptosis-inducing agent in APL.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Our laboratory seeks to develop minimally invasive
   cost-effective methods to improve screening and detection of curable
   precursors to cervical cancer. Previously, we have presented pilot
   studies that assess the diagnostic power of auto-fluorescence and
   diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. In the present study, we evaluate
   diffuse reflectance spectra from a comprehensive 850 patient clinical
   trial to determine its ability to discriminate normal tissue from
   several grades of abnormal cervical tissue.
   Methods. Diffuse reflectance spectra at four source detector separations
   measured from 549 cervical sites were available for analysis. Three
   classifiers were implemented: one used spectral data directly as input,
   a second used simple spectral features such as peak position and
   intensity, and one used principal component analysis for feature
   selection. Algorithms were developed and evaluated using leave-one-out
   cross-validation to classify normal and precancerous cervical tissue.
   The percentage of samples correctly classified was used to evaluate and
   compare the performance of the algorithms, as compared to histology.
   Results. Diffuse reflectance spectra of cervical precancer showed
   consistent differences from that of normal tissue at all source detector
   separations; reflectance intensity of precancer was lower than that of
   normal tissue on average. Normal cervical tissue spectra show more
   intensity variation between patients than other tissue grades.
   Reflectance spectra acquired from the closest source detector
   separations consistently demonstrated the most relevant information for
   tissue classification. Two persistent spectral patterns demonstrated
   that the contribution of hemoglobin absorption and the
   wavelength-dependent spectral slope contained relevant information for
   classification.
   Conclusions. Spectral patterns in diffuse reflectance spectra can be
   used for the discrimination of normal cervical tissue from low grade and
   high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The link between the kidney and hypertension has been considered a
   villain-victim relationship. High blood pressure levels are a
   well-recognized feature in chronic renal disease, but the ability of
   mild-to-moderate hypertension to produce renal insufficiency has been
   questioned. Nephrosclerosis, benign nephrosclerosis, and hypertensive
   kidney disease are terms that clinicians use when renal damage is
   thought to be secondary to essential hypertension. Many cases of
   end-stage renal disease are ascribed to so-called benign
   nephrosclerosis. This entity could actually be a primary renal disease
   affecting the preglomerular microvasculature, perhaps genetically
   mediated and ethnically influenced, and showing a heterogeneous clinical
   expression. African Americans suffer from nephrosclerosis more
   frequently than Caucasians. Nephrosclerosis affecting Caucasians seems
   to show a less aggressive pattern and could represent early age-related
   renal sclerosis. The risk of end-stage renal disease is increased when
   atherosclerotic lesions in large renal arteries coexist. Age, systolic
   blood pressure, proteinuria, and concomitant cardiovascular disease are
   well-known promoters of renal failure. A multifactorial strategy,
   including antihypertensive and antiproteinuric drugs, and lipid-lowering
   and anti-platelet agents, could improve cardiovascular and renal
   outcomes in patients with nephrosclerosis.}},

   using a modified version of the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search
   Procedure. Farther more a stopping criterion based on Lagrangean

   produces high quality solutions. The proposed algorithm was tested on
   numerous benchmark problems from TSPLIB with very satisfactory results.

Abstract = {{In at least some cases of justified perceptual belief, our perceptual
   experience itself, as opposed to beliefs about it, evidences and thereby
   justifies our belief. While the phenomenon is common, it is also
   mysterious. There are good reasons to think that perceptions cannot
   justify beliefs directly, and there is a significant challenge in
   explaining how they do. After explaining just how direct perceptual
   justification is mysterious, I consider Michael Huemer's (Skepticism and
   the Veil of Perception, 200 1) and Bill Brewer's (Perception and Reason,
   1999) recent, but radically different, attempts to eliminate it. I argue
   that both are unsuccessful, though a consideration of their mistakes
   deepens our appreciation of the mystery.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress may be monitored using biomarkers presented in blood
   and erythrocytes. The purpose of the study was to determine the
   antioxidant balance in the blood of cows with a normal periparturient
   period. Blood samples from 30 cows were taken twice in the last month of
   pregnancy and three times after calving. Enzymatic (SOD, GPX, CAT) and
   non-enzymatic (uric acid, bilirubin, albumin) antioxidants, total
   antioxidant status (TAS) and concentrate of MDA+HAE as an indicator of
   lipid peroxidation were measured. Slightly increased activity of SOD,
   GSH-Px, CAT took place during the week of calving. The decrease of TAS
   was observed from 14-7 days before parturition. The lower TAS level was
   maintained until the 4(th) week of lactation (p < 0.05). Concentration
   of MDA+4-HNE was the lowest during the week of calving. At that time an
   increased bilirubin and uric acid level were observed (p < 0.05). The
   results indicate that antioxidant defense might be impaired in the
   periparturient period and it returns to an antioxidant balance in the
   second month of lactation.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a renewed cause of devastation in the

   phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs). Balanced synthesis of these

Abstract = {{Empirical studies have shown that the size distribution of firms can be
   described as a Pareto distribution. However, these studies have focused
   on large firms and aggregate statistics. Little attention has been
   placed on the role of technology in shaping firm size distributions.
   Using a comprehensive dataset of manufacturing firms and the Community
   Innovation Survey from the Netherlands, the paper investigates the
   relationship between firm size and technology. It shows that
   technological factors shape the distribution of firm size, suggesting
   that the Pareto law is not an invariant property and that technology can
   constrain the ``self-organising{''} character of industrial economies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the relative
   importance of personal and social environmental predictors of the
   consumption of fruit, high-fat snacks and breakfast.
   Design: A school-based cross-sectional survey. Data were collected
   through written questionnaires.
   Setting: Students from eight schools in the southern part of The
   Netherlands.
   Subjects: Six hundred and one students from preparatory secondary
   vocational education schools.
   Results: About a quarter of the variation in actual behaviours and
   intentions to change the behaviours could be explained. Stepwise
   multiple regression analysis revealed that, for all three behaviours,
   higher intention to change was especially associated with a more
   positive attitude and subjective norm, and higher intentions to increase
   fruit intake with more positive self-efficacy expectations. With regard
   to actual consumption, a more positive attitude towards eating fruit was
   the only significant correlate of a higher consumption of fruit. A more
   positive attitude towards eating high-fat snacks, perceived lower intake
   of the mother, and higher food availability and accessibility were
   associated with consumption of high-fat snacks, and a more positive
   attitude to breakfast more frequently was associated with more frequent
   breakfast consumption.
   Conclusion: The results indicate that adolescents' attitudes are the
   most important determinants of different health-related eating
   behaviours and intentions to change. Interventions promoting a healthy
   diet for adolescents should include creative strategies to achieve
   positive associations with healthy dietary changes.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Abstract = {{We study the stability of the fixed-point solution of an array of
   mutually coupled logistic maps, focusing on the influence of the delay
   times, tau(ij), of the interaction between the ith and jth maps. Two of
   us recently reported {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 134102 (2005)] that if
   tau(ij) are random enough, the array synchronizes in a spatially
   homogeneous steady state. Here we study this behavior by comparing the
   dynamics of a map of an array of N delayed-coupled maps with the
   dynamics of a map with N self-feedback delayed loops. If N is
   sufficiently large, the dynamics of a map of the array is similar to the
   dynamics of a map with self-feedback loops with the same delay times.
   Several delayed loops stabilize the fixed point, when the delays are not
   the same; however, the distribution of delays plays a key role; if the
   delays are all odd a periodic orbit (and not the fixed point) is
   stabilized. We present a linear stability analysis and apply some
   mathematical theorems that explain the numerical results.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the daily treatment costs and the average
   cost-effectiveness of three topical onychomycosis therapies amorolfine
   5\% and ciclopirox 8\% nail lacquers and tioconazole 28\% nail solution
   - when used as indicated in France, the UK, Germany and Italy. Methods:
   The quantity of drug required and nail size measurements were
   investigated and, knowing the cost per bottle of each study drug, used
   to calculate the average treatment cost per patient. Using the
   prevalence of infection data, the weighted average total treatment cost
   per patient and hence the weighted average daily treatment cost and cost
   per patient cured, were calculated. Results: Amorolfine was consistently
   more cost-effective in terms of weighted average daily treatment cost
   and cost per patient cured than ciclopirox and tioconazole, when all
   therapies were used as indicated to treat onychomycosis. In France, for
   example, the weighted average daily treatment cost of amorolfine was
   found to be Euro 0.23 and Euro 0.40 when used once and twice a week,
   respectively; the cost per patient cured for amorolfine was Euro 84. By
   comparison, the weighted average daily treatment cost of ciclopirox was
   found to be Euro 0.81; the cost per patient cured was Euro 252.
   Conclusions: When used as indicated, amorolfine 5\% nail lacquer is more
   cost-effective than ciclopirox 8\% and tioconazole 28\% for
   onychomycosis of toenail, fingernail or both in males and females in
   France, UK, Germany and Italy.}},

   there are thermodynamically analyzed the causes of pressure-difference
   occurrence at a wall (Delta P = = P-1 - P-2 where P-1, P-2-the pressures
   in bulks with volumes of V-1 and V-2, respectively)-the driving force of
   wall moving (G = Delta P not equal 0), which is induced by diffusion of
   B sort atoms along the wall and into the bulk (from a wall). The
   obtained conclusions for a model A-B-gas system are used in DIGM
   thermodynamic analysis. As noted, by decreasing of the free energy
   system, the DIGM driving force can arise due to the internal-energy
   increasing caused by arising (or amplification) of interaction of
   migrating GB sites with other GB sites and (or) with bulk defects
   (including generated during the DIGM process). As shown, the alloying in
   the GB migration region is not the cause of GB migration during the
   DIGM, and is a corollary of the second law of thermodynamics. The
   obtained conclusions concerning thermodynamic conditions of the DIGM
   observation do not contradict to the experimental results of DIGM
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The postcopulatory mate guarding behaviours by territorial and
   non-territorial males for submerged ovipositing females were
   investigated in the field. After copulations, females in tandem began to
   oviposit at the water surface and thereafter they usually submerged
   completely underwater. The female often repeated the submergence and
   emergence at several oviposition sites. When the female submerged
   completely, the male released her without submergence and rested above
   the water surface during oviposition (non-submerged guarding), or the
   male submerged completely and remained in tandem, whether only at first
   or for the duration of the oviposition (submerged guarding). Territorial
   males always performed non-submerged guarding when the female oviposited
   inside their territories. The non-submerged guarding inside the
   territory might allow the territorial male both to guard the ovipositing
   female and to maintain his territory On the other hand, when the female
   oviposited inside another male's territories, territorial and
   non-territorial males exhibited both non-submerged guarding and
   submerged guarding. Thus, P. p. pilidorsum males may adopt either
   submerged guarding or non-submerged guarding in response to change in
   the probability of a takeover of the emerged female by rival males

Abstract = {{Electromotility of cochlear outer hair cells (OHC) is associated with
   conformational changes in the integral membrane protein prestin. We have
   recently reported that electrical stimulation evokes significant
   prestin-dependent changes in the length, width, and area of the
   longitudinal section of OHCs, but not in their volume. In contrast,
   prestin-independent responses elicited at constant membrane potential
   are associated with changes in cell length, width, and volume without
   significant changes in their longitudinal section area. In this report
   we describe a novel analytical technique, based on a simple theoretical
   model and continuous measurement of changes in cell length and
   longitudinal section area, to evaluate the contribution of each one of
   these mechanisms to the motile response of OHCs. We demonstrate that if
   the relative change in OHC length (L) during the motile response is
   expressed as L = A(2) x V-1 (with A and V being the relative changes in
   longitudinal section area and volume, respectively), A(2) will describe
   the contribution of the prestin-dependent mechanism whereas V-1 will
   describe the contribution of the prestin-independent mechanism. Thus,
   relative changes in any two of these cellular morphological parameters
   (L, A, or V) would be necessary and sufficient for characterizing any
   OHC motile response. This simple approach provides access to information
   previously unavailable, and may become a novel and important tool for
   increasing our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
   OHC motility.}},

Abstract = {{The type 1 IGF receptor (IGF-IR) is thought to localize to a subset of
   lipid rafts, known as caveolae, but the impact on IGF signaling remains
   controversial. We investigated this potential regulatory mechanism by
   assessing IGF function in caveolae-positive (3T3L1 and NWTb3) and
   -negative (HepG2) cells. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that
   IGF-IR and insulin receptor substrate 1 associated with caveolin, a
   caveolar marker, in 3T3L1 and NWTb3 cells. Subcellular fractionation
   showed that methyl-cyclodextrin, which disrupts lipid rafts by
   sequestration of cholesterol, disrupted the colocalization of caveolin
   and the IGF-IR at the plasma membrane. Methyl-cyclodextrin did not alter
   IGF-I-induced 3T3L1 or NWTb3 proliferation but significantly impaired
   the ability of IGF-I to protect these cells from apoptosis.
   Immunoblotting revealed that methyl-cyclodextrin had no effect on
   IGF-I-induced activation of the IGF-IR or insulin receptor substrate 1
   but increased and decreased the phosphorylation of MAPK and protein
   kinase B, respectively. In caveolae-negative HepG2 cells, the effect of
   methyl-cyclodextrin on IGF signaling and cellular function was similar
   to that observed in caveolae-positive 3T3L1 and NWTb3 cells.
   Furthermore, transfecting caveolin into HepG2 cells to give
   morphologically identifiable caveolae made no difference to IGF action,
   despite a demonstrable interaction between caveolin and the IGF-IR. This
   suggests that although IGF-IR localizes to caveolin-rich subcellular
   fractions and coimmunoprecipitates with caveolin, caveolae may not be
   obligatory for IGF signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Background Lower socioeconomic position (SEP) is related to higher
   prevalence of Type 2 diabetes, yet little is known about the
   relationship of SEP with incident diabetes.
   Methods The association between SEP, measured by self-reported
   education, income, and occupation, and Type 2 diabetes incidence was
   examined in a community sample of 6147 diabetes-free adults from Alameda
   County, CA. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the effect of
   baseline (1965) and time-dependent (value changes over time) measures of
   SEP on incident diabetes over a 34-year study period (1965-99).
   Demographic confounders (age, gender, race, and marital status) and
   potential components of the causal pathway (physical inactivity,
   smoking, alcohol consumption, body composition, hypertension,
   depression, and health care access) were included as fixed or
   time-dependent covariates.
   Results Education, income, and occupation were associated with increased
   diabetes risk in unadjusted models. In baseline models adjusted for
   demographics, respondents with < 12 years of education had 50\% excess
   risk compared with those with more education {[}hazard ratio (HR) = 1.5,
   95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.11-2.04], but income and occupation
   were no longer significantly associated with increased risk. Further
   adjustment minimized the significance of all associations.
   Time-dependent effects were consistently elevated for low education and
   male blue-collar occupation, but non-significant after full adjustment
   (HR = 1.1, 95\% CI 0.79-1.47 and HR = 1.3, 95\% CI 0.91-1.89,
   respectively).
   Conclusions Socioeconomic disadvantage, especially with low educational
   attainment, is a significant predictor of incident Type 2 diabetes,
   although associations were largely eliminated after covariate
   adjustment. Obesity and overweight appear to mediate these associations.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent publication, J.G. Wijmans {[}J.G. Wijmans, Process
   performance = membrane properties + operating conditions, J. Membr. Sci.
   220 (2003) 1-3] drew attention to the risk associated with a common
   practice in pervaporation: reporting experimental permeates fluxes
   without the corresponding operating conditions. The systematic use of
   the membrane permeability, in place of the raw fluxes, clearly improves
   the comparison as well as the prediction of process performances.
   Nevertheless, this strategy does not generally lead to a single value
   for the permeability coefficient; moreover, discrepancies are often
   reported for systems which exhibit variable permeabilities.
   This work analyses the limitations of the permeability concept based on
   a preliminary case study limited to a single penetrant (propane
   permeation through a silicone rubber membrane). In addition, it is shown
   that solution-diffusion model fundamentals enable experimental data
   reconciliation. This novel strategy is preferable when we wish to
   compare and compute the permeate flux on a rigorous basis. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Stroke is a major health problem worldwide, causing high morbidity and
   mortality. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 10\% of stroke
   cases in the United States and Europe and up to 30\% in Asian
   populations. Intracerebral hemorrhage is less treatable than other forms
   of stroke and causes higher morbidity and disability. Data suggest that
   early hematoma growth is the principal cause of early neurological
   deterioration after ICH. Prospective and retrospective studies indicate
   that early hematoma growth occurs in 18-38\% of patients scanned within
   three hours of ICH onset, and that hematoma volume is an important
   predictor of 30-day mortality. Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa,
   NovoSeven(R)), a powerful initiator of hemostasis, is approved for the
   treatment of bleeding in patients with hemophilia and inhibitors, and
   can also promote hemostasis in patients with normal coagulation. A
   Phase-IIB randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, close-ranging
   trial has been conducted in 399 patients with ICH to investigate the
   potential of rFVIIa as an ultra-early hemostatic therapy. A reduction in
   hematoma growth in non-coagulopathic ICH patients was evident with
   reduced mortality and improved clinical outcome at three months. The
   significance of these findings for neurocritical care is discussed.}},

   protein-coding genes found in other metazoan mtDNA. An AT tandem repeat
   and a possible C-rich domain within the putative control region could

   mollusks, separated from the black chiton Katharina tunicata by the
   individual translocations of 3 tRNAs. Compared with other mtDNA regions,
   sequences from the ATP8, NAD2, NAD4L, NAD6, and 12S rRNA genes, as well

Journal = {{ACTA ORTHOPAEDICA}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{76}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background The frontal pelvic plane has traditionally served as the
   reference plane for implantation of the acetabular cup during total hip
   arthroplasty, with referencing performed with the patient supine on the
   operating table. During daily activities in an upright position, the
   frontal pelvic plane changes from a horizontal to a vertical
   orientation. If this change in orientation is accompanied by a
   substantial change in pelvic inclination angle, it would mean that the
   use of the frontal pelvic plane as a reference plane for implantation of
   the acetabular cup would not be valid for proper alignment of the cup.
   To evaluate this possibility, we measured the change of inclination of
   the pelvis from the supine to the standing position.
   Subjects and methods We evaluated 120 patients, first positioned in a
   standing position and then supine on a table. Three pelvic landmarks
   were digitized percutaneously, and the spatial coordinates were
   calculated with regard to pelvic orientation in the horizontal and the
   vertical plane.
   Results We found a mean inclination of 6.7 degrees in the standing
   position and 5.6 degrees in the supine position. Patients who were more
   than 60 years of age who did not have coxarthrosis had a greater
   inclination angle (8.7 degrees) while standing. Pelvic orientation was
   stable with regard to the supine and standing positions. These results
   were independent of sex, level of arthrosis, or status after
   implantation of a total hip replacement.
   Interpretation The frontal pelvic plane is a valid reference plane for
   implantation of the acetabular cup.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate radiographically the
   effectiveness of alveolar distraction osteogenesis (ADO) technique for
   vertical reconstruction of atrophy alveolar ridges in partially
   edentulous patients.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 60 vertical distraction osteogenesis
   procedures were performed in 55 patients. Two panoramic radiographies
   were performed in all patients, one the day before the beginning of
   distraction, and one after consolidation period, 12 weeks
   postoperatively. The radiographic analysis consisted of obtaining the
   amount of the vertical bone gain (VBG) in each radiography. For this, we
   obtained initially the magnification factor (MF) of each panoramic
   radiography by dividing the real size (RS) of the activation rod among
   the image size (IS) of the activation rod. After this, to obtain the
   VGB, we measured initially the length of the distracton preactivation
   (LD1), which consisted of the distance between the superior portion of
   the basal plate and the superior portion of the transport plate,
   multiplying by the ME Then, we measured the length of the distraction
   postactivation (LD2), using the same method described before, in
   radiographies performed 12 weeks postoperatively. The VBG was obtained
   using the following formula: VBG = LD2 - LD1. The results were applied
   to descriptive statistical analysis. Complications were also
   investigated during all of the treatments.
   Results: The mean alveolar distraction achieved in 60 cases was 6.27 mm
   (range, 0 to 10.83 mm). According to the region treated, 51.6\% were in
   the posterior mandible (mean VBG, 4.60 mm), 36.66\% were in the anterior
   maxilla (mean VBG, 7.46 mm), 8.33\% were in the anterior mandible (mean
   VBG, 6.73 mm), and 3.33\% were in the posterior maxilla (mean VBG, 6.32
   mm). The overall rate of complications that compromised the success of
   the technique was 8.44\%. The increased radiopacity of the distracted
   region could be observed in the 12-week period after surgery.
   Conclusions: The ADO technique was demonstrated to be an effective tool
   to treat vertical defects of the alveolar ridge with a success rate of
   91.66\%. Our radiographic analysis seems to be an important tool in
   verifying the technique as well as planning implant placement after ADO.

Abstract = {{The wavelength-dependent photoisomerizations of the asymmetric bilirubin
   BR-IX alpha and of the symmetric bilirubin-III alpha (BR-III) and
   mesobilirubin-XIII alpha (MBR-XIII) bound to human serum albumin (HSA)
   in aqueous solution were analysed with the help of an exciton coupling
   model. The modelling was based on the absorption and circular dichroism
   (CD) spectra (bisignate Cotton effect). Time-dependent density
   functional theory (TD-DFT) of the free BR-IX molecule suggested the
   presence of two main bands of exciton coupling character in the blue
   region of the spectrum, and other weaker bands of charge transfer
   character at longer wavelengths. These peculiarities were taken into
   account to fit the photoisomerization quantum yields in the blue-green
   region as functions of the wavelength, obtaining the bandshape of the
   exciton coupling bands from the experimental CD spectra. The other
   excitons were extracted from the decomposition of the band resulting
   from the difference between the absorption spectrum and the sum
   (normalized-to-absorption) of the two CD excitons. We expressed
   photoisomerization quantum yields in terms of the sum of the
   contributions to photon absorption deriving from all the exciton states
   normalized to total absorption. For all the reversible photoprocesses of
   bilirubins and for the irreversible one of BR-IX alpha in HSA (i.e.
   lumirubin formation), we give reliable mean values of the individual
   state excitation probabilities and photoisomerization efficiencies in

   Specifically, the authors examine some new techniques that allow the

   both duration (survival) and quantitative changes (growth curves). These
   new shared growth-survival parameter models may be used to characterize
   the declining functions that anticipate the onset of AD. The authors
   apply these models to data from the Kungsholmen Project, a longitudinal
   study of aging in Stockholm, Sweden. They examine age-based
   survival-frailty models for the onset of AD, latent growth-decline curve
   models for changes in cognition over age, and 3 alternative forms of
   models for the shared relationships of survival and early cognitive
   decline. The accuracy and reliability of this approach is considered for
   a better understanding of the developmental course of AD in these data,

Abstract = {{Using survey methodology, this exploratory study examined the
   attitudinal and perceptual dimensions of body image among 1,272 eighth-
   and ninth-grade males and females from higher and lower socioeconomic
   backgrounds in Buenos Aires, Argentina (n = 195), Guatemala City,
   Guatemala (n = 212), Havana, Cuba (n = 213), Lima, Peru (n = 218),
   Panama City, Panama (n 195), and Santiago, Chile (n = 239). The two
   dimensions of body image were assessed by showing the participants nine
   male and nine female silhouettes depicting body sizes ranging from
   extremely thin (\#1) to extremely obese (0). Approximately 50\% of the
   male and female adolescents chose silhouette \#3 as best depicting the
   attractive male body. Silhouette \#2 was chosen by 45\% of the females
   as best depicting feminine attractiveness, while 45\% of the males chose
   silhouette \#3. When identifying the silhouette that best depicted the
   healthy male body, 26\% of the participants chose silhouette \#2, 41\%
   chose \#3, and 19\% chose \#4. Silhouette \#2 was selected by 33\% of
   the adolescents as best depicting the healthy female body, 38\% chose
   \#3, and 14\% chose \#4. In all cities, the effect of body mass index
   (BMI) on body satisfaction was highly significant (p < 0.001). Almost
   40\% of the middle weight adolescents indicated a preference to be
   thinner, even though 72\% of the males and 84\% of the females in this
   subgroup already perceived themselves as thin. Similarly, 89\% of the
   heavier weight participants indicated a preference to be thinner, even
   though only 10\% of the males and 2\% of the females in this subgroup
   perceived themselves as heavy. In five of the six cities, a
   significantly higher (p < 0.05) percentage of females than males desired
   to be thinner, the exception being Havana, where the distribution of
   desired change in body size was almost identical for males and females.
   Findings suggest a need for culturally sensitive, age- and
   gender-specific preventive interventions focusing on the importance of
   achieving a healthy weight during adolescence to promote body size
   acceptance among adolescents who are at a healthy weight.}},

   supported pipes conveying fluid, focusing on the subharmonic resonance
   case. Finally, using recently developed global bifurcation methods, we
   detect the presence of orbits which are homoclinic to certain invariant
   sets for the resonant case. In the dissipative case, we are able to
   identify conditions under which a generalized Silnikov orbit would
   exist. In certain parameter regions, we prove that such orbits exist
   which are homoclinic to fixed points on the slow manifold, leading to
   chaotic dynamics in the system. These orbits provide the mechanism by
   which energy transfer between modes may occur. (c) 2005 Published by

Abstract = {{The vast majority of excitatory connections in the hippocampus are made
   on dendritic spines. Both dendritic spines and molecules within the
   membrane are able to move, but the physiological role of these movements
   is unclear. in the developing brain, spines show highly dynamic
   behaviour thought to facilitate new synaptic connections. Dynamic
   movements also occur in adults but the role of this movement is unclear.
   we have studied the effects of the most important excitatory
   neurotransmitter, glutamat, and found receptor activation to enhance
   movement of molecules within the spine membrane. This action of
   glutamate may be important in regulating the trafficking of
   neurotransmitter receptors that mediate change in synaptic function. In
   addition, we have studied the dynamic interactions between pre- and
   postsynaptic structures labelled with FM 4-64 and a membrane-targeted
   GFP (green fluorescent protein), respectively, in hippocampal slice
   cultures under conditions of increased activity, such as epilepsy. Our
   findings suggest a novel form of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity
   where spontaneous glutamate release is sufficient to trigger changes in
   the hippocampal microcircuitry by attracting neighbouring spines
   responsive to an enhanced level of extracellular glutamate.}},

   salt marsh to assess the importance of locatly produced versus
   allochthonous food sources on a scale of several hundred meters. We
   compared the gut contents and stable isotope signatures of F.
   heteroditus from four regions along the central river of a Maine salt
   marsh to the distinct food sources and isotopic signatures of the region
   of the marsh in which they were caught. F. heteroditus were relying on
   locally produced food sources even on the scale of several hundred
   meters. They fed daily in a small area less than 6 ha and maintained
   relatively strong site fidelities over the course of several months.
   Phytoplankton and salt marsh detritus both contributed to the high
   production of F. heteroclitus, terrestrial plant detritus was not an
   important component of their diet. The diet and feeding patterns of F.
   heteroditus from this small Maine salt marsh were similar to the
   patterns found in much larger salt marshes, suggesting that locally

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Dietary iron overload found in sub-Saharan Africa might be
   caused by an interaction between dietary iron and an iron-loading gene.
   Caucasian people with ferroportin gene mutations have iron overload
   histologically similar to that found in African patients with iron
   overload. Ferroportin is also implicated in the hypoferremic response to
   inflammation. The prevalence of the ferroportin Q248H mutation, unique
   to African people, and its association with dietary iron overload, mean
   cell volume (MCV) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were examined in 19
   southern African families.
   Methods: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme
   digestion were used to identify the Q248H mutation. Statistical analysis
   was carried out to correlate the presence of the mutation with markers
   of iron overload and inflammation.
   Results: We identified three (1.4\%) Q248H homozygotes and 53 (24.1\%)
   heterozygotes in the families examined in the present study. There was
   no increased prevalence of the mutation in index subjects or their
   families. Logistic regression showed significantly higher serum ferritin
   concentrations with the mutation. The mean cell volume (MCV) was
   significantly lower, and the serum CRP significantly higher in subjects
   who carried the mutation.
   Conclusions: The present study of 19 families with African iron overload
   failed to show evidence that the ferroportin (Q248H) mutation is
   responsible for the condition. Logistic regression, correcting for
   factors influencing iron status, did show increased ferritin levels in
   individuals with the mutation. The strong association with low MCV
   suggests the possibility that the ferroportin (Q248H) mutation might
   interfere with iron supply, whereas the elevated serum CRP might
   indicate that the ferroportin mutation influences the inflammatory
   response in African populations. (C) 2005 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty

Abstract = {{The beneficial effects of edible oils long-term supplementation in blood
   pressure (BP) and cardiac structure were investigated in spontaneously
   hypertensive rat (SHR) and streptozotocin diabetic (Db) SHR (45 mg/rat
   i.p.). Twenty-five 12-week old male SHR were divided into four SHR-Db
   groups and one SHR group, SHR-Db groups each receiving, respectively,
   olive oil, palm oil and fish oil, and another SHR-Db group with placebo
   by gavage on a daily basis for 6 weeks. Myocardial structures were
   analyzed through light microscopy and stereology. In SHR-Db, the BP and
   the myocardium were significantly altered by oil supplementation. The
   BP, the interstitial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte size showed a
   significant decrease in treated SHR-Db than in SUR or untreated SHR-Db.
   The myocardial microvasculature and number of cardiornyocytes were
   higher in all treated groups, especially in fish oil group. Long-term
   edible oil supplementation showed beneficial effects decreasing BP
   levels and offsetting adverse myocardial remodeling in diabetic SHR. (c)

Abstract = {{Purpose. The development, implementation, and outcomes assessment of an
   innovative pharmacist-managed ambulatory care and community pharmacy
   practice clinic are described.
   Summary. The Clinical Partners Program at The Ohio State University
   (OSU) provides an active learning environment for students and
   residents, offers a patient-focused practice model based on
   pharmaceutical care principles, and serves as an arena for applied
   research in pharmacy practice. The program offers multiple services,
   including anticoagulation management, diabetes self-management,
   cholesterol management, hepatitis C education, herbal product and
   dietary supplement consultations, medication management, smoking
   cessation, and wellness. The practice is currently staffed by two
   faculty members from the college of pharmacy, with a 0.8
   full-time-equivalent (FTE) pharmacist and a 0.65 FTE community pharmacy
   resident. It has served as a training site for 17 pharmacy residents, 28
   bachelor of science (B.S.) in pharmacy students, 30 post-B.S. doctor of
   pharmacy (Pharm.D.) students, and 132 entry-level Pharm.D. students at
   various levels of training The most successful methods of reimbursement
   for programs have been contracted services with OSU Managed Health Care
   Systems, Inc., which serves OSU faculty and staff and fee-for-service
   billing, charged directly to non-OSU patients. Numerous studies have
   shown that Clinical Partners has consistently demonstrated improved
   therapeutic outcomes over those achieved in traditional practice.
   Faculty are exploring outreach services, including the development of
   advanced practice community sites for the college, establishing patient
   care services within physician offices, and providing disease management
   services for self-insured employers.
   Conclusion. The Clinica Partners Program has improved patient care and
   provided education and training opportunities for pharmacy students and
   residents.}},

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Background. The molecular basis of renal aging is not completely
   understood.
   Methods. We used global gene expression monitoring by cDNA microarrays
   to identify age associated genes in human kidney samples. Our samples
   included young (8 weeks-8 years, N = 4), adult (31-46 years, N = 7), and
   old kidneys (71-88 years, N = 9).
   Results. Old kidneys had more glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy,
   interstitial fibrosis, and fibrous intimal thickening in small arteries.
   We identified similar to 500 genes that were differentially expressed
   among the three age groups. Old kidneys appeared to have increased
   extracellular matrix turnover and a nonspecific inflammatory response,
   combined with a reduction in processes dependent on energy metabolism
   and mitochondrial function. Quantitative supervised bioinformatics
   analyses of adult and old kidney expression data correlated the
   expression of 255 gene profiles with renal pathology scores. Microarray
   class prediction analysis (PAM) identified 50 unique genes that
   segregated old kidneys into two distinct clusters: those more similar
   within age class (OO, N = 5) versus old kidneys more similar to adult
   kidneys (OA, N = 4). The expression of six functionally significant
   genes was further validated by quantitative reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (FN1, MMP7, TNC,
   SERPIN3A, BPHL, CSPG2) in the experiment group and, subsequently,
   confirmed independently in 17 additional old and adult age-stratified
   test kidney samples. The p53 inducible gene, CSPG2, performed best in
   separating OO kidneys from adults and OA samples in this analysis.
   Conclusion. The method described in this study using independent
   validation samples can be envisioned to test utility of the identified
   genes in assessing age-related changes that contribute to decline in
   renal function.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. Bisphosphonates inhibitors of posteoclasts, have been shown
   to alleviate many of the devastating consequences associated with
   metastatic bone disease. However, recent reports have shown that
   bisphosphonates may cause osteonecrosis of the jaws. Since the
   publication of these initial reports, the authors have treated several
   patients with osteonecrosis of the jaws who had a history of receiving
   bisphosphonate therapy.
   Methods. The authors reviewed the medical records of patients who
   visited their clinic between September 2003 and December 2004 and who
   had osteonecrosis of the jaws and a history of having received
   bisphosphonate therapy but no irradiation to the head and neck.
   Results. Eleven patients (four female and seven male) with a mean age of
   69 years were included in this report. They had received bisphosphonate
   therapy for a mean duration of 34 months. Radiographic data showed loss
   of bone density at sites of osteonecrosis, and histologic examination
   demonstrated necrosis of bone without evidence of metastates.
   Conclusions and Clinical Implications. Further research is required for
   better understanding of the role of bisphosphonates in the development
   of osteonecrosis of the jaws. Until more is known, the authors recommend
   that measures be taken to prevent osteonecrosis in those at risk,
   including identifying patients with a history of having received
   bisphosphonate therapy before they undergo dental surgery. To help
   identify such patients, the authors propose the use of a screening
   questionnaire. When feasible, physicians should consult with their
   patients' general dentists or oral surgeons before patients begin
   bisphosphonate therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Lewy body dementia (DLB) is common but frequently
   misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease plus delirium or parkinsonism. Drugs
   used in this disorder can cause exacerbations: neuroleptic medication is
   relatively contraindicated because some patients show severe neuroleptic
   sensitivity, antiparkinsonian medication has the potential to exacerbate
   psychotic symptoms, and even cholinesterase inhibitors, while relatively
   safe, have provoked adverse responses in some DLB patients. There are
   few data available about the use of memantine in DLB. Case presentation:
   A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease and parkinsonism.
   After memantine was started he developed severe fluctuations in
   awareness, visual hallucinations, agitation, and worsened parkinsonism.
   When he was evaluated thoroughly, the diagnosis was revised to Lewy body
   dementia, leading to changes in treatment that were associated with
   dramatic improvement in the patient's mental status. Conclusions: In our
   patient, motor and cognitive symptoms worsened with memantine treatment;
   these resolved after memantine was discontinued.}},

Abstract = {{Galium aparine L. is a troublesome broadleaved weed in winter wheat
   fields and other winter-sown crops in Eurasia and North America. Field
   experiments were conducted in Havza and Kavak, Samsun-Turkey, to
   evaluate the effect of different densities of G. aparine on the
   productivity of four wheat cultivars and to determine the effects of
   different seeding rates of wheat cultivars on the competitive ability of
   G. aparine. In experiments over 3 years, the wheat cultivar Panda was
   taller at maturity than other cultivars at both sites. Although
   Bezostaja was naturally shorter than other cultivars, its height
   decreased less due to competition from G. aparine than other cultivars.
   Wheat grain yields increased with seeding rate, either in the presence
   or in the absence of G. aparine at both locations. Based on wheat yields
   the relative competitiveness of the wheat cultivars was Bezostaja >
   Momtchill = Panda > Kate A-1. G. aparine biomass and seed numbers were
   reduced by an increase in the wheat seeding rate and by cultivar

   sediment response to climate and geomorphic change over the past 120
   years. Interannual varve thickness correlates with annual flood
   magnitude. Interdecadal trends in varve thickness are influenced by
   other environmental factors such as glacier recession. Despite major
   differences in the lakes and their contributing watersheds, substantial
   concordance is observed among the records. A pronounced change in the
   nature of lake sedimentation, accompanied by higher interannual
   variability, occurred in 1980. The change coincides with an increase in
   the magnitude of autumn flooding and major re-organization of the North
   Pacific climate system. These results highlight new directions for
   palaeoenvironmental research using varved sediment records, specifically
   to study the magnitude and spatial extent of past hydro-climatic events.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric dust concentrations are very sensitive to the dust surface
   emissions that are mainly controlled by saltation and sandblasting
   processes. Thus, a correct modeling of concentrations directly depends
   on mass flux parameterization accuracy. In 2001, Alfaro and Gomes
   proposed a whole set of parameterizations linking the dust flux to
   surface wind speed and soil characteristics. Their formulation is based
   on the integration of elementary fluxes, discretized along a soil size
   distribution. But, because the sandblasting is a threshold process, this
   discretization must be as fine as possible when the threshold acts. And
   because this threshold depends on dynamic parameters, it is necessary to
   always integrate fluxes with a high resolution. This leads to large
   numerical simulations. In this paper it is shown that it is possible to
   estimate fluxes with a good accuracy by adding equations that are
   dedicated to better describing the sensitive parts of the emission
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the use of an impact detection algorithm to
   locate a potentially damaging impact on an orthotropic plate by
   detecting the stress waves generated by such an event. The proposed
   algorithm was tested experimentally on a sandwich plate by using
   ultrasonic signals. The arrival times of stress waves at different
   frequencies at the sensor locations were determined by analyzing the
   recorded signals using the wavelet transforms. The stress wave
   propagation phenomenon was characterized by measuring the propagation
   speeds along different directions. This data along with the sensor
   co-ordinates were input into the impact detection algorithm, which uses
   the difference in time of flight to the sensors and trigonometric
   identities to locate impact source locations. The accuracy of the method
   was demonstrated by the close agreement observed between the estimated
   locations for the three impact locations studied with the actual
   locations of the impact loads applied. In particular.. maximum error in
   the estimation of the co-ordinates of the impact location was less than
   9\% for all different types of loading considered. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Temporal variability (seasonal and inter-annual) in the assembly of
   phytoplankton communities from the northern Alboran Sea was
   investigated. For this purpose, the taxonomic composition of the micro-
   and nano-phytoplankton communities at three fixed stations was
   determined every three months from 1994 to 2002. A total of 357
   different taxa were identified. Most of them (about 54\%) were diatom
   species belonging to 57 genera. Dinoflagellates and coccolitophorids
   accounted for 118 and 30 taxa respectively. Two time periods could be
   differentiated with respect to the cell abundance. Thus, the mean
   abundance from 1994 to 1999 was 338 cell ml(-1) and it dropped to about
   60 cell ml(-1) during the period 2000-2002. Diatoms and un-identified
   small flagellates dominated the communities during this first period,
   although a significant increase in the abundance of coccolitophorids
   occurred after 1997. Pseudo-nitzschia, Leptocylindrus and Chaetoceros
   were the dominant genera. In contrast, the coccolitophorids Emiliania
   huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa spp. quantitatively dominated the communities
   from 2000 to 2002. These shifts in the Community assembly were assessed
   by performing a sample-oriented stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA).
   The analysis separated the samples into three year-groups, with great
   inter-annual variability. In contrast, the SDA did not find any seasonal
   sucessional pattern. In spite of this result, chlorophyll a and cell
   abundance tended to be higher in the spring period, which has been
   described for the whole Alboran basin. The nutrient concentrations in
   the 75 m upper seawater layer had inter-annual fluctuations. Thus,
   NO3-+NO2-, PO4-3 and Si(OH)(4) concentrations decreased significantly in
   1997-1998. Additionally, lower Si(OH)(4) concentrations and Si:P molar
   ratios were obtained in 2000. These results suggest that the
   inter-annual shifts in the phytoplankton taxonomic composition were due
   to alterations in the nutrient regime. In this paper we discuss the
   possible rationale for these nutrient changes.}},

Abstract = {{Hystricognathi is a higher monophyletic taxon within Rodentia that is

   Since the original findings are based on a small sample of species,

   paper provides new insight, into the morphology of one of the most
   significant characters in two additional species of Hystricognathi, i.e.
   Petromus typicus A. SMITH, 1831 and Octodon degus MOLINA, 1782. In both
   species an arterial ring within the inverted yolk sac splanchnopleura
   that is associated with a network of capillaries is present throughout
   pregnancy. Consequently, the existence of the so called ``fibrovascular
   ring{''} is confirmed for these species and distributional data Suggest
   that it can be regarded as a synapomorphic feature of Hystricogrnathi.
   Thus, two of the three original diagnostic characters of Hystricognathi
   are now confirmed for a larger set of taxa.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of temperature on rates and pathways of CH, production and
   on the abundance and structure of the archaeal community were
   investigated in acidic peat from a mire in northern Scandinavia (68
   degrees N). We monitored the production of CH4 and CO2 over time and
   measured the turnover of Fe(II), ethanol, and organic acids. All
   experiments were performed with and without specific inhibitors
   (2-bromoethanesulfonate {[}BES] for methanogenesis and CH3F for
   acetoclastic methanogenesis). The optimum temperature for methanogenesis
   was 25 degrees C (2.3 mu mol CH4 (.) g {[}dry weight](-1) (.) day(-1)),
   but the activity was relatively high even at 4 degrees C (0.25 mu mol
   CH4 (.) g {[}dry weight](-1) (.) day(-1)). The theoretical lower limit
   for methanogenesis was calculated to be at - 5 degrees C. The optimum
   temperature for growth as revealed by real-time PCR was 25 degrees C for
   both archaea and bacteria. The population structure of archaea was
   studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis
   and remained constant over a wide temperature range. Hydrogenotrophic
   methanogenesis accounted for about 80\% of the total methanogenesis.
   Most 16S rRNA gene sequences that were affiliated with methanogens and
   all McrA sequences clustered with the exclusively hydrogenotrophic order
   Methanobacteriales, correlating with the prevalence of hydrogenotrophic
   methanogenesis. Fe reduction occurred parallel to methanogenesis and was
   inhibited by BES, suggesting that methanogens were involved in Fe
   reduction. Based upon the observed balance of substrates and
   thermodynamic calculations, we concluded that the ethanol pool was
   oxidized to acetate by the following two processes: syntrophic oxidation
   with methanogenesis (i) as an H-2 sink and (ii) as a reductant for
   Fe(III). Acetate accumulated, but a considerable fraction was converted
   to butyrate, making volatile fatty acids important end products of
   anaerobic metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis results in
   fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver insufficiency if untreated. Medical
   therapy often fails and partial external biliary diversion has been
   recommended to prevent early liver transplantation. We present a new
   technique of performing a laparoscopic partial external biliary
   diversion and report our experience in a first series of infants.
   Methods: From October to November 2004, four consecutive patients with
   progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis underwent the laparoscopic
   partial biliary diversion procedure. A three-trocar technique was used.
   A proximal jejunal conduit was constructed after exteriorization of the
   small bowel via the infraumbilical trocar incision. After repositioning
   of the bowel, an isoperistaltic cholecystojejunostomy was carried out
   laparoscopically. The distal jejunal conduit was placed as a stoma at
   the right abdominal trocar site.
   Results: There were no intraoperative events. The mean duration of the
   operation was 156.5 min. The postoperative course was uneventful in all
   patients with full enteral feedings on day 2. The laboratory and
   clinical signs of cholestasis were reduced up to a mean follow-up of 2
   months (range, 1.5-2.5).
   Conclusion: The laparoscopic partial biliary diversion procedure is
   feasible with all the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. Long-term
   results remain to be evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common causes of
   sudden cardiac death in young adults and is a familial disease in at
   least 60\% of cases. Causative mutations have been identified in several
   sarcomeric genes, including the myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) gene.
   Although numerous causative mutations have been identified, the
   pathogenetic process is still poorly understood. A large animal model of
   familial HCM in the cat has been identified and may be used for
   additional study. As the first spontaneous large animal model of this
   familial disease, feline familial HCM provides a valuable model for
   investigators to evaluate pathophysiologic processes and therapeutic
   (pharmacologic or genetic) manipulations. The MYBPC3 gene was chosen as
   a candidate gene in this model after identifying a reduction in the
   protein in myocardium from affected cats in comparison to control cats
   (P < 0.001). DNA sequencing was performed and sequence alterations were
   evaluated for evidence that they changed the amino acid produced, that
   the amino acid was conserved and that the protein structure was altered.
   We identified a single base pair change (G to C) in the feline MYBPC3
   gene in affected cats that computationally alters the protein
   conformation of this gene and results in sarcomeric disorganization. We
   have identified a causative mutation in the feline MYBPC3 gene that
   results in the development of familial HCM. This is the first report of
   a spontaneous mutation causing HCM in a non-human species. It should
   provide a valuable model for evaluating pathophysiologic processes and
   therapeutic manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{Major variations in systemic retinoid and steroid levels during the
   periparturient period suggest that these potent signaling molecules play
   a role in the decreased innate immune response observed at early
   lactation. This period coincides with a marked increase in the incidence
   of coliform mastitis. Two critical parameters have been identified
   within the cow's first line of defense during acute coliform mastitis:
   efficient mammary epithelium remodeling and functional polymorphonuclear
   leukocytes. The overall aim of this review is to relate the actual
   knowledge on retinoids and steroids to bovine mammary gland
   immunobiology. Recent insights on the potential role of retinoic acid,
   estradiol and progesterone in the development and maintenance of a
   normal glandular epithelial architecture are provided. In parallel,
   their influence on myelopoiesis and PMN functionality is also discussed.
   Retinoic acid and steroid hormones predominantly serve as ligands that
   activate specific transcription factors belonging to a nuclear receptor
   superfamily and thereby control gene expression. Additionally, both
   retinoids and steroids may act via non-nuclear receptor mediated
   pathways. There are also indications on a subtle interplay between
   retinoic acid and estrogen pathways. These messengers probably affect
   cell proliferation and apoptosis through interaction with local growth
   factors e.g., the insulin-like growth factor/insulin-like growth factor
   binding protein-axis, and with the extracellular matrix e.g., by
   modulating matrix metalloproteinase activity. In conclusion, arguments
   are provided supporting the importance of retinoids and sex steroid
   hormones in the mammary gland innate immune defense. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Title = {{The Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE)
   Schizophrenia Trial: Clinical comparison of subgroups with and without
   the metabolic syndrome}},

Abstract = {{The metabolic syndrome (MS) is highly prevalent among patients with
   schizophrenia (current estimates 35-40\%), yet no data exist on the
   correlation of this diagnosis with illness severity, neurocognitive or
   quality of life measures in this population.
   Methods: Using baseline data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of
   Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) Schizophrenia Trial, assignment of MS
   status was performed using an updated definition derived from the
   National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria. Those with and
   without MS were compared on the basis of primary and secondary variables
   of interest from baseline data encompassing psychiatric, neurocognitive
   and quality of life measures.
   Results: Of 1460 subjects enrolled at baseline, MS status could be
   reliably assigned for 1231 subjects, with a prevalence of 35.8\% using
   the NCEP derived criteria. After adjustment for age, gender, race,
   ethnicity and site variance, those with MS rated themselves
   significantly lower on physical health by SF-12 (p <.001), and scored
   higher on somatic preoccupation (PANSS item G 1) (p =.03). There were no
   significant differences between the two cohorts on measures of symptom
   severity, depression, quality of life, neurocognition, or self-rated
   mental health. Neither years of antipsychotic exposure nor alcohol usage
   were significant predictors of MS status when adjusted for age, gender,
   race, and ethnicity.
   Conclusions: The metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent in this large
   cohort of schizophrenia patients and is strongly associated with a poor
   self-rating of physical health and increased somatic preoccupation.
   These results underscore the need for mental health practitioners to
   take an active role in the health monitoring of patients with
   schizophrenia to minimize the impact of medical comorbidity on long-term
   mortality and on daily functioning. Outcomes data from CATIE will
   provide important information on the metabolic and clinical impact of
   antipsychotic treatment for those subjects with MS and other medical
   comorbidities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that activation of protease-activated receptors
   (PARs) on the surface of endothelial and epithelial cells may play a
   role in general mechanisms of inflammation. We hypothesized that mast
   cell tryptase activation of endothelial cell PAR-2 is coupled to
   increased calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) activity and increased
   platelet-activating factor (PAF) production that may play a role in
   inflammatory cell recruitment at sites of vascular injury. Stimulation
   of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) with 20 ng/ml
   tryptase increased iPLA2 activity, arachidonic acid release, and PAF
   production. These tryptase-stimulated responses were inhibited by
   pretreatment with the iPLA2-selective inhibitor bromoenol lactone (BEL;
   5 mu M, 10 min). Similar patterns of increased iPLA2 activity and PAF
   production were also seen when HCAEC were treated with SLIGKV, which
   represents the tethered ligand sequence for the human PAR-2 once the
   receptor is cleaved by tryptase. Tryptase stimulation also increased
   cell surface expression of P-selectin, decreased electrical resistance,
   and increased neutrophil adherence to the endothelial cell monolayer.
   The tryptase-stimulated increases in both cell surface P-selectin
   expression and neutrophil adhesion were also inhibited with BEL
   pretreatment. We conclude that tryptase stimulation of HCAEC contributes
   importantly to early inflammatory events after vascular injury by
   activation of iPLA2, leading to arachidonic acid release, PAF
   production, cell surface P-selectin expression, and increased neutrophil
   adherence.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction National audit provides a basis for establishing
   performance against national standards, benchmarking against other
   service providers and improving standards of care. For effective audit,
   clinical indicators are required that are valid, feasible to apply and
   reliable. This study describes the methods used to develop clinical
   indicators of continence care in preparation for a national audit. Aim
   To describe the methods used to develop and test clinical indicators of
   continence care with regard to validity, feasibility and reliability.
   Method A multidisciplinary working group developed clinical indicators
   that measured the structure, process and outcome of care as well as
   case-mix variables. Literature searching, consensus workshops and a
   Delphi process were used to develop the indicators. The indicators were
   tested in 15 secondary care sites, 15 primary care sites and 15
   long-term care settings. Results The process of development produced
   indicators that received a high degree of consensus within the Delphi
   process. Testing of the indicators demonstrated an internal reliability
   of 0.7 and an external reliability of 0.6. Data collection required
   significant investment in terms of staff time and training. Conclusion
   The method used produced indicators that achieved a high degree of
   acceptance from health care professionals. The reliability of data
   collection was high for this audit and was similar to the level seen in
   other successful national audits. Data collection for the indicators was
   feasible to collect, however, issues of time and staffing were
   identified as limitations to such data collection. The study has
   described a systematic method for developing clinical indicators for
   national audit. The indicators proved robust and reliable in primary and
   secondary care as well as long-term care settings.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was undertaken to clarify the effect and interaction
   of choline chloride (CC) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), the water- and
   fat-soluble sources of choline, on the performances of kuruma shrimp,
   Marsupenaeus japonicus juveniles using as response variables such as
   percent weight gain (\%WG), specific growth rate (SGR), survival (SR\%),
   feed efficiency ratio (FER), protein efficiency ratio (PER), proximate
   composition, fatty acids profile and free choline and PC contents in the
   whole body of kuruma shrimp. A 40-day feeding trial was conducted as a 2
   x 3 factorial experiment with six test diets containing three levels of
   CC (0.3, 0.6 and 1.2 g kg(-1)) and two levels of soybean PC (SPC; 2 and
   4 g kg(-1)). Both of the choline sources (CC and SPC) showed a
   significant interaction (P < 0.05) regarding all the evaluated response
   variables except for the proximate and fatty acid contents.
   Interestingly, there was a positive effect (P < 0.05) of CC observed
   with increasing its level at the low level of SPC and vice versa.
   However, the magnitudes of the beneficial effect of CC in terms of the
   evaluated parameters were changed with the different dietary levels of
   SPC. Also, the inclusion of higher levels of SPC (4 g kg(-1)) or CC (0.6
   and 1.2 g kg(-1)) diminished the effect of the other source.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background The Framingham risk estimation (FRE) serves as the basis for
   identifying which asymptomatic adults should be treated with aspirin and
   lipid-lowering therapy in primary prevention. However, the FIRE
   generally yields low estimates of 10-year ``hard{''} coronary heart
   disease (CHD) event risk with few women (<70 years) qualifying for
   preventive pharmacologic therapy despite relatively high lifetime risk.
   We postulated that traditional risk factor assessment might fail to
   identify a sizeable portion of women with a sibling history for
   premature CHID as having advanced subclinical atherosclerosis.
   Methods We studied 102 asymptomatic women (mean age 51 7 years) who were
   the sisters of a proband hospitalized with documented premature CHID.
   Participants underwent risk factor assessment and multidetector computed
   tomography for coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring. Based on FRE
   prediction of 10-year risk for hard CHD events, participants were
   classified as low risk (<10\%) (n = 100), intermediate risk (10\%-20\%)
   (n = 2), or high risk (>20\%) (n = 0). Significant subclinical
   atherosclerosis was defined as age-sex adjusted >75th percentile CAC
   scores.
   Results Ninety-eight percent were at low risk (mean FRE of only 2\% +/-
   2\%). However, 40\% had detectable CAC, 12\% had CAC >100, and 6\% had
   CAC >= 400. Based on CAC score percentiles, 32\% had significant
   subclinical atherosclerosis and 17\% ranked above the 90th percentile.
   Conclusion Among women classified as low risk by FRE, a third had
   significant subclinical atherosclerosis. Sisters of probands with
   premature CHID appear to be a high-risk group and may warrant
   noninvasive screening for subclinical atherosclerosis to appropriately
   target individuals for more aggressive primary prevention therapy than
   what is currently recommended.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Delayed repair of peripheral nerve injuries often results in
   poor motor functional recovery. This may be a result-of the
   deterioration 4 or loss of endoneurial pathways in the distal nerve
   stump before motor axons can regenerate into the stump.
   METHODS: Using the rat femoral nerve, we protected distal endoneurial
   pathways of the saphenous nerve with either cross-suture, of the
   quadriceps motor nerve (Group A) or resulture of the saphenous nerve
   (Group B) to compare-later motor regeneration into the ``protected{''}
   saphenous nerve pathway to chronic denervation and ``unprotected{''}
   saphenous nerve (Group C). A total of 60 rats, 20, per group,were
   operated,on. After this protection (or lack thereof) for 8 weeks, the
   motor branch of the femoral nerve was cut and sutured to the distal
   saphenous nerve to allow motor regeneration into protected and
   unprotected saphenous nerve stumps. The quantitative assessment of
   axonal regeneration was performed after 6 weeks by use of nerve sampling
   for axon counts and retrogradely labeled motor neuron counts.
   RESULTS: Significantly more myelinated axons innervated the motor (A)
   than the sensory (B) and no-protection (C) groups. There were
   significantly m-ore-retrogradely labeled femoral motor neurons in Group
   A than in the unprotected group (C).
   CONCLUSION: We conclude that even 2 months of denervation of the distal
   nerve pathway is deleterious to regeneration and that protection of the
   pathway improves subsequent reinnervation and regeneration. Moreover, if
   the desired regeneration is motor, protection of the distal nerve
   pathway by a motor nerve conditions is better than a sensory nerve.}},

Abstract = {{The success of the solar-electric ion engine powering the DSI spacecraft
   has paved the way toward the use of low-thrust electrical engines in
   future planetary/interplanetary missions. Vis-a-vis a chemical engine,
   an electrical engine has a higher specific impulse, implying a possible
   decrease in propellant mass; however, the low-thrust aspect discourages
   the use of an electrical engine in the near-planet phases of a trip,
   since this might result in an increase in flight time. Therefore, a
   fundamental design problem is to find the best combination of chemical
   propulsion and electrical propulsion for a given mission, for example, a
   mission from Earth to Mars.
   With this in mind, this paper is the third of a series dealing with the
   optimization of Earth-Mars missions via the use of hybrid engines,
   namely the combination of high-thrust chemical engines for planetary
   flight and low-thrust electrical engines for interplanetary flight. We
   look at the deep-space interplanetary portion of the trajectory under
   rather idealized conditions.
   The two major performance indexes, the propellant mass and the flight
   time, are in conflict with one another for the following reason: any
   attempt at reducing the former causes an increase in the latter and vice
   versa. Therefore, it is natural to consider a compromise performance
   index involving the scaled values of the propellant mass and flight time
   weighted respectively by the compromise factor C and its complement 1 -
   C. We use the compromise factor as the parameter of the one-parameter
   family of compromise trajectories. Analyses carried out with the
   sequential gradient-restoration algorithm for optimal control problems
   lead to results which can be highlighted as follows.
   Thrust profile. Generally speaking, the thrust profile of the compromise
   trajectory includes three subarcs: the first subarc is characterized by
   maximum thrust in conjunction with positive (upward) thrust direction;
   the second subarc is characterized by zero thrust (coasting flight); the
   third subarc is characterized by maximum thrust in conjunction with
   negative (downward) thrust direction.
   Effect of the compromise factor. As the compromise factor increases, the
   propellant mass decreases and the flight time increases;
   correspondingly, the following changes in the thrust profile take place:
   (a) the time lengths of the first and third subarcs (powered phases)
   decrease slightly, meaning that thrust application occurs for shorter
   duration; also, the average value of the thrust direction in the first
   and third subarcs decreases, implying higher efficiency of thrust
   application wrt the spacecraft energy level; as a result, the total
   propellant mass decreases; (b) the time length of the second subarc
   (coasting) increases considerably, resulting in total time increase.
   Minimum time trajectory. If C = 0, the resulting minimum time trajectory
   has the following characteristics: (a) the time length of the coasting
   subarc reduces to zero and the three-subarc trajectory degenerates into
   a two-subarc trajectory; (b) maximum thrust is applied at all times and
   the thrust direction switches from upward to downward at midcourse.
   Minimum propellant mass trajectory. If C = 1, the resulting minimum
   propellant mass trajectory has the following characteristics: (a) the
   thrust magnitude has a bang-zero-bang profile; (b) for the powered
   subarcs, the thrust direction is tangent to the flight path at all
   times. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The routine use of mitomycin C to enhance glaucomatous
   filtering surgery has found wide acceptance. Complications of the
   application of mitomycin C have been repeatedly noticed. We now report a
   previously undescribed complication showing a toxic effect of mitomycin
   C to the corneal endothelium. Methods: Patients underwent routine
   trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. Following surgery, the eyes were
   examined by biomicroscopy and specular microscopy of the corneal
   endothelium. Results: In two cases, we observed a partial decompensation
   of the corneal endothelium resulting in a well-demarcated clear zone of
   the cornea and a second zone with thickening of the cornea and a bullous
   keratopathy adjacent to the filtering bleb. The specular microscopy
   showed marked irregularities of the endothelial cells and areas of
   necrosis in those parts of the cornea close to the filtering bleb.
   Conclusions: The two cases described here demonstrate that if the
   corneal endothelium is already compromised before surgery, the
   application of mitomycin C may have an additional toxic effect on the
   endothelium and may result in a partial bullous keratopathy. Surgeons
   should be aware of this complication.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the performance of preferred modes of
   exercise will serve to maximize the affective response to exercise.
   Support has come from work that has shown the effect of exercise on
   affect to be mediated by enjoyment. However, there is a need to compare
   modes of exercise that differ in preference and enjoyment, yet are
   similar in intensity, duration and muscle group. This experiment was
   designed to achieve this aim. Thirty-four college-aged women completed
   20 minutes of exercise on high and low preference modes of continuous
   exercise. Intensity was maintained at 65-75\% of HRR. Affect was
   measured by the PANAS, collected prior to and at 5, 20, and 40 min post
   exercise. Results provided partial support for the hypothesis as mode
   preference moderated the improvement in positive affect, with no effect
   on the reduction in negative affect. Interestingly, regardless of mode
   preference, enjoyment ratings were found to mediate the change in both
   positive and negative affect.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective and Setting: To develop a computer model, using a
   geographical information system (GIS), to quantify potential health
   effects of air pollution from a new energy from waste facility on the
   surrounding urban population.
   Design: Health impacts were included where evidence of causality is
   sufficiently convincing. The evidence for no threshold means that annual
   average increases in concentration can be used to model changes in
   outcome. The study combined the ``contours'' of additional pollutant
   concentrations for the new source generated by a dispersion model with a
   population database within a GIS, which is set up to calculate the
   product of the concentration increase with numbers of people exposed
   within each enumeration district exposure response coefficients, and the
   background rates of mortality and hospital admissions for several
   causes.
   Main results: The magnitude of health effects might result from the
   increased PM10 exposure is small about 0.03 deaths each year in a
   population of 3 500 000, with 0.04 extra hospital admissions for
   respiratory disease. Long term exposure might bring forward 1.8-7.8
   deaths in 30 years.
   Conclusions: This computer model is a feasible approach to estimating
   impacts on human health from environmental effects but sensitivity
   analyses are recommended.
   Relevance to clinical or professional practice: The availability of GIS
   and dispersion models on personal computers enables quantification of
   health effects resulting from the additional air pollution new
   industrial development might cause. This approach could also be used in
   environmental impact assessment. Care must be taken in presenting
   results to emphasise methodological limitations and uncertainties in the
   numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Proton-NMR-based metabonomics offers a rare opportunity as a definitive
   screening technique for biofluids and tissue biopsies. The procedure is
   extraordinary in that it allows the `complete biochemical picture' to be
   examined at one time and is able to detect subtle but repeatedly
   consistent disparities that may be occurring in different, and perhaps
   unrelated, biochemical pathways. Such metabolic responses to an initial
   perturbation in homeostasis may be followed over a sequential
   time-course to their eventual dissipation or consequent sequelae. The
   application of this technique is beginning slowly to filter into the
   area of endocrine research and has been used to examine long-term and
   diffuse physiological alterations that may occur following such events
   as anabolic steroid treatment of cattle and the exposure of endometrial
   cells to tamoxifen. Although only modest inroads have been made so far,
   this technique promises immense potential for future researches within
   the endocrine field. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The polymorphism at codon 129 (M129V) of the prion protein gene (PRNP)
   is a recognized genetic marker for susceptibility to Creutzfeldt-Jakob
   disease (CJD) in the Caucasians. The distribution of this polymorphism
   in healthy individuals provides an important starting point for the
   evaluation of CJD risk in the general population. Early studies of
   reference population cohorts demonstrated that methionine/valine
   heterozygosity was the most frequent genotype. These studies were
   performed in relatively small numbers of control subjects and do not
   correspond with the findings of more recent investigations. In this
   study, we present an analysis of the codon M129V distribution in 613
   corneal donors, representing one of the largest control groups examined
   to date. Methionine homozygotes represented 48.1\%, valine homozygotes
   8.7\% and methionine/valine heterozygotes 43.2\%. While age-related
   difference was not significant, differentiation according to the gender
   showed significant difference. The observed highest proportion of
   methionine homozygotes and statistically significant difference between
   genders as well as comparison with results obtained in other countries
   underline the need to re-evaluate the generally used reference data on
   M129V, including consideration of the gender, age and geographical

Abstract = {{Object. To improve the effectiveness of boron neutron capture therapy
   (BNCT) for malignant gliomas, the authors used epithermal rather than
   thermal neutrons for deep penetration and two boron compounds-sodium
   borocaptate (BSH) and boronophenylalanine (BPA)-with different
   accumulation mechanisms to increase the boron level in tumors while
   compensating for each other's faults.
   Methods. Thirteen patients, 10 of whom harbored a glioblastoma
   multiforme (GBM), one gliosarcoma, one an anaplastic astrocytoma, and
   one an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, were treated using this modified
   BNCT between January 2002 and December 2003. Postoperatively,
   neuroimaging revealed that only one patient with a GBM had no lesion
   enhancement postoperatively. The patients underwent F-18-BPA positron
   emission tomography, if available, to assess the accumulation and
   distribution of BPA before neutron radiotherapy. The neutron fluence
   rate was estimated using the Simulation Environments for Radiotherapy
   Applications dose-planning system before irradiation. The patients'
   volume assessments were performed using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
   or computerized tomography (CT) scanning. Improvements in the disease as
   seen on neuroimages were assessed between 2 and 7 days after irradiation
   to determine the initial effects of BNCT; its maximal effects were also
   analyzed on serial neuroimages.
   The mean tumor volume before BNCT was 42.3 cm(3). Regardless of the
   pre-BNCT tumor volume, in every patient harboring an assessable lesion,
   improvements on MR or CT images were recognized both at the initial
   assessment (range of volume reduction rate 17.4-71\%, mean rate 46.4\%)
   and at follow-up assessments (range of volume reduction rates
   30.3-87.6\%, mean rate 58.5\%). More than 50\% of the contrast-enhanced
   lesions disappeared in eight of the 12 patients during the follow-up
   period.
   Conclusions. This modified BNCT produced a good improvement in malignant
   gliomas, as seen on neuroimages.}},

Abstract = {{Transferrin, well known as an iron-transport protein, can bind other
   metal ions, including toxic ones, and is considered to play an important
   role in the transportation of such metal ions. Here, a crystal structure
   of aluminium-bound transferrin is described for the first time.
   Colourless needle-shaped crystals of aluminium-bound ovotransferrin were
   obtained in PEG 400 solution. Structural determination was performed by
   molecular replacement using diferric (iron-bound) ovotransferrin as a
   model and the structural refinement was performed in the 50-2.15
   angstrom resolution range. The overall organization of the
   aluminium-bound form is almost the same as the iron-bound form: the
   protein is folded into two homologous lobes (N- and C-lobes) with two
   domains; two metal-binding sites are located within the inter-domain
   clefts of each lobe. Four residues ( one Asp, two Tyr and one His) and
   one bicarbonate anion were found to bind an aluminium ion in either
   lobe, as in the iron-bound form. The highly similar domain-closed
   structure of the Al3+-bound form may permit the binding of Al3+-bound
   transferrin to the transferrin receptor. An unusual interaction, the
   dilysine trigger, which facilitates iron release at low pH in the
   endosome, was also found in the Al3+-bound form. These findings support
   the participation of transferrin in the transport of Al3+ ions in vivo.}},

   concentration of organofluorine compounds was uniform throughout the
   dispersion layer, which showed a lower refractive index than the initial

   following genes increased in response to T-3 in a TR beta-specific
   manner: the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha,
   its target genes glucose transporter (GLUT)1 and platelet-type
   phosphofructokinase (PFKP), and the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)4.
   The products of these genes have important roles in cellular glucose
   metabolism. HIF-1 alpha expression and activity can be regulated through
   phosphatidylinositol-OH-3-kinase (PI3K) and MAPK signaling; thus the
   possibility of alternative, nonnuclear pathways of TH action was raised.
   We examined the involvement of these pathways in mediating TH effects by
   treating human skin fibroblasts with 2 nM T-3 in the absence or presence
   of either the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the MAPK inhibitor PD98059. T-3
   induced HIF-1 alpha mRNA by 2.7-fold (+/- 0.4; P < 0.013). This increase
   was completely abrogated by LY294002 (1.1 +/- 0.1; nonsignificant =
   0.57), but preserved in the presence of PD98059 (2.2 +/- 0.2; P <
   0.009). Western blotting confirmed these results at the protein level,
   indicating dependency on the PI3K pathway. The same pattern of response
   was observed for GLUT1, PFKP, and MCT4 expression. To examine whether
   HIF-1 alpha is directly induced, we used the translation inhibitor
   cycloheximide (CHX). T-3 induction of HIF-1 alpha mRNA was not affected
   by CHX, whereas T-3 effect on GLUT1, PFKP, and MCT4 mRNA was completely
   abrogated by CHX. These results demonstrate that cytosolic activation of
   the PI3K signaling pathway has a role in TH-mediated direct (HIF-1
   alpha) and indirect (GLUT1, PFKP, MCT4) gene expression, and possibly
   provides a link between TH and cellular glucose metabolism in human
   fibroblasts.}},

Abstract = {{The optical properties of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) heavy
   water Cherenkov neutrino detector are measured in situ using a light
   diffusing sphere ({''}laserball{''}). This diffuser is connected to a
   pulsed nitrogen/dye laser via specially developed underwater optical
   fibre umbilical cables. The umbilical cables are designed to have a
   small bending radius, and can be easily adapted for a variety of
   calibration sources in SNO. The laserball is remotely manipulated to
   many positions in the D2O and H2O volumes, where data at six different
   wavelengths are acquired. These data are analysed to determine the
   absorption and scattering of light in the heavy water and light water,
   and the angular dependence of the response of the detector's
   photomultiplier tubes. This paper gives details of the physical
   properties, construction, and optical characteristics of the laserball

   Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR). The corrosion studies were carried out by gravimetric
   methods, and the product of the corrosion analysed using XRD to find out
   the nature of the corrosion product. The biodegradation and corrosion

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To report our experience with the use of 95\% ethanol as sclerotherapy
   for symptomatic simple renal cysts.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS
   Sixty patients with 64 symptomatic simple renal cysts were treated by
   ultrasonography (US)-guided percutaneous aspiration and injection of
   95\% ethanol (31 men and 29 women, mean age 46 years, SD 22). The main
   presentation was renal pain in 34 patients, renal mass in nine,
   hypertension in 11 and haematuria in six; 24 cysts were on the right, 32
   on the left and four bilateral. Patients were evaluated after 1 month
   and then every 6 months by clinical assessment, US and intravenous
   urography. Success was defined as complete when there was total ablation
   of the cyst and partial when there was a recurrence of less than half
   the original cyst volume with the resolution of symptoms. Failure was
   defined as the recurrence of more than half of cyst volume and/or
   persistent symptoms.
   RESULTS
   After aspiration and ethanol sclerotherapy, there was microscopic
   haematuria in two patients and low-grade fever (<38.3 degrees C) in two,
   but no major complications. During a mean (range) follow-up of 19
   (14-40) months there was complete cyst ablation in 54 cysts and partial
   resolution in 10. Pain disappeared or was much improved in all patients.
   After cyst ablation hypertension was well controlled with no medication
   in all 11 hypertensive patients and haematuria disappeared in all six
   affected patients.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Ethanol sclerotherapy for symptomatic simple renal cysts is simple,
   minimally invasive and highly effective. We recommend it as the first
   therapeutic option in these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Early identification of high-risk patients undergoing major
   surgery can result in an aggressive management affecting the outcome.
   Methods. We designed a prospective cohort study of 93 adult patients
   undergoing major oncological surgery to identify the predictive risk
   factors for developing postoperative severe sepsis.
   Results. Nineteen of 93 patients developed a severe sepsis after
   surgery; seven of the septic patients died in intensive care unit.
   Multivariate analysis discriminated preoperative and postoperative
   (first and second day after surgery) predictive risk factors. The
   postoperative severe sepsis was independently associated with
   preoperative factors like male gender (OR 4.7, 95\% CI between 1.5 and
   15.5, P < 0.01) and Charlson co-morbidity index (OR 1.3, 95\% CI between
   1.07 and 1.6, P < 0.01). After the surgery, the presence of systemic
   inflammatory response syndrome (OR 4.0, 95\% CI between 1.02 and 15.7, P
   < 0.05) and a logistic organ dysfunction score on day 2 (OR 3.3, 95\% CI
   between 1.9 and 5.7, P < 0.001) were found as independent predictive
   factors.
   Conclusion. We have shown that some of the markers that can be easily
   collected in the preoperative or postoperative visits can be used to
   screen the patients at high risk for developing severe sepsis after
   major surgery.}},

   north-eastern Swaziland, was initiated in 1998. Since then, a total of
   799 bats have been banded including five cohorts of same-aged
   individuals of known age. Cohort life-tables and survivorship Curves
   were calculated using these data. For both males and females,
   survivorship was low in the first year, but increased thereafter.
   Approximately 15\% of females and 10\% of males banded as juveniles in
   1998 and 1999 survived to three years of age. Of female bats banded as
   adults in July 1998 (n = 39), 23\% had survived to January 2003 (4.5
   years). The corresponding value for males (n = 6) was zero. Of 28 male
   bats banded in 1998, only one (4\%) was recaptured after four years.
   Female values probably reflect true survival and mortality, whereas,
   dispersal and movement complicate the values for males. Female Nycteris
   thebaica did not randomly select roosting sites. The 15 Culverts were
   occupied by six discrete groups of female bats. The presence of male
   bats at the study site was irregular, with movements of 9 km having been
   recorded by one particular individual.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: This study examined the association between homicide rates and GNP
   per capita ( as a measure of economic development) among all age- and
   sex-specific groups in 53 countries. Methods: Cross-sectional data on
   homicide rates by age- and sex-specific groups were obtained for 53
   countries from World Health Statistics Annual 1996. The association
   between homicide rates and economic development was studied by using two
   methods: ( 1) with regression analysis and ( 2) by categorizing the data
   into four income-based country groups and then comparing the differences
   in their mean values. Results: Results indicate that there was a
   negative correlation between homicide rates and economic development.
   The association between homicide rates and country GNP per capita became
   stronger with increasing age. Pearson's product moment correlation
   coefficient was strongest among older age groups (65+year) in both sexes
   ( male, r=-0.77 and female, r=-0.71). The correlation was weakest and
   positive among 1- to 4-year-old children ( males, r=0.17 and females,
   r=0.07). The homicide rate among females was highest for < 1-year-old
   children in low income countries (LICs) (12.8 per 100,000). Conclusions:
   Lower middle-income countries are in the stage of high priority where
   both homicide rates and homicide as percentage of total death are high,
   and its impact was greatest for young males. However, infanticide as a
   public health problem seems highly concentrated in the poorest
   countries, while homicide among small children, 1- 4 years old, appears
   to be a universal phenomenon across all nations.}},

Title = {{Prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy in osteoporotic hip fracture patients
   in London}},
Journal = {{CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1891-1894}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: It is well established that vitamin D levels are suboptimal
   in the elderly and that adults with fragility fracture are more likely
   to have serum vitamin D levels either lower than those of control
   patients of similar age, or below the normal range.
   Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy in an
   elderly population with hip fractures from London (UK) and compare
   levels with data previously presented from Glasgow (UK).
   Research design and methods: A retrospective patient audit was carried
   Out over a 17-month period (September 2003-January 2005). Patient
   records were searched for hip fracture admissions and cross matched with
   vitamin D analysis carried out within 3 days of the hip fracture
   admission. The resulting records were hand searched to exclude patients
   with a hip fracture resulting from high impact/trauma.
   Results: There were data for 103 hip fracture patients, 79.6\% of the
   patients were women (n = 82). The mean age at the time of fracture was
   73.4 years, 100\% were aged 60 years or over and 41\% were aged 75 years
   or over Around 20\% of the patients were receiving supplementation with
   calcium and/or vitamin D and were not excluded from the analysis. The
   mean vitamin D level was 32.1 nmol/L (12.9 ng/mL), SD = 19.4 (7.8),
   however, it is likely that the true mean is lower since in approximately
   15\% of cases vitamin D levels were reported as < 12.5 nmol/L, but were
   transcribed at 12.5 nmol/L in order to allow a numerical value to be
   calculated. Ninety-nine per cent of patients had a vitamin D level < 80
   nmol/L, 94.2\% < 70 nmol/L and 81.6\% < 50 nmol/L.
   There were no significant differences by patient age or sex, however,
   there were significant seasonal differences in vitamin D. In the year
   from September 2003 to August 2004, 82.8\% of summer admissions had
   vitamin D levels < 70 nmol/L compared with 98.0\% in winter (p = 0.04).
   Mean vitamin D levels in the 30 patients with parathyroid hormone (PTH)
   levels above the reference range were significantly lower than levels in
   the 71 patients within the range: mean 19.9 nmol/L, SD = 16.2 versus
   mean 37.5 nmol/L, SD = 18.5 (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, 50\% of the
   patients with PTH levels above the reference range had vitamin D levels
   < 12.5 nmol/L, reflecting extremely low levels of vitamin D.
   Conclusions: This study confirms almost universal vitamin D inadequacy
   among 103 patients admitted to hospital with hip fracture in London,
   although the prevalence of inadequacy is slightly lower than that seen
   in a similar study carried out in Glasgow.}},

Abstract = {{The study of T cell positive selection in the thymus has long been
   focused on the specificity of the MHC-TCR interactions, making use of
   genetically manipulated mice that display TCR specificities or selecting
   peptides of limited diversity. However, little is known on the role of
   the MHC molecules irrespective of the peptide specificity and the
   implications of MHC multigenic structure in thymic positive selection
   have not been addressed. Here, we investigated the effect of MHC class
   II genetic configuration on the positive selection efficiency of
   naturally generated pre-selection repertoires in the mouse thymus.
   Analysis of positively selected thymocyte populations in MHC-congenic
   and -transgenic mice revealed that expression of I-E molecule in the
   thymic cortex increases positive selection efficiency of CD4 cells by
   approximately 50\%. We show that increments in positive selection
   attributable to either the I-A and I-E genes are not due to increased
   MHC class II expression in the thymic cortex and are not affected by the
   number of MHC alleles. Collectively, our findings imply that MHC class
   II gene-restricted TCR specificities significantly contribute to
   positive selection efficiency, introducing the notion that multigenic
   structure of the MHC locus serves to increase selection of
   non-overlapping TCR repertoires.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Interactions of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with human
   epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) were studied with respect to the effect
   of surfactant on dispersion of MWCNT aggregates and cytotoxicity. Our
   earlier studies had shown that the unmodified MWCNTs were localized
   within the cytoplasmic vacuoles of HEKs and elicited an inflammatory
   response. However, MWCNTs in solution tend to aggregate and, therefore,
   cells are exposed to large MWCNT aggregates. The purpose of this study
   was to find a surfactant that prevents the formation of large aggregates
   of MWCNTs without being toxic to the HEKs. HEKs were exposed to serial
   dilutions (10\% to 0.1\%) of L61, L92, and F127 Pluronic and 20 or 60
   Tween for 24 hours. HEK viability, proportional to surfactant
   concentration, ranged from 27.1\% to 98.5\% with Pluronic F127;
   viability with the other surfactants was less than 10\%. Surfactants
   dispersed and reduced MWCNT aggregation in medium. MWCNTs at 0.4 mg/mL
   in 5\% or 1\% Pluronic F127 were incubated with HEKs and assayed for
   interleukin 8 (IL-8). MWCNTs were cytotoxic to HEKs independent of
   surfactant exposure. In contrast, MWCNT-induced IL-8 release was reduced
   when exposed to 1\% or 5\% Pluronic F127 (P < .05). However, both MWCNTs
   and surfactant, alone or in combination, increased IL-8 release compared
   with control exposures at 12 and 24 hours. These results suggest that
   the surfactant-MWCNT interaction is more complex than simple dispersion
   alone and should be investigated to determine the mode of interaction.

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To examine the temporal changes in the modulation transfer
   function (MTF) of the eye after a blink.
   METHODS. The distance MTF of a 5-mm pupil was derived from double-pass
   retinal images in 20 healthy young subjects at various intervals after a
   blink (1 second up to 15 seconds). Such measurements include the effects
   of wavefront aberration, scattered light, and errors in focus and are
   thus more relevant to real life than are estimates of MTF based on
   wavefront errors alone.
   RESULTS. Optimal MTF by a variety of criteria was found some 6 seconds
   after a blink.
   CONCLUSIONS. Inclusion of the effects of stray light and errors of focus
   does not affect the finding that optimal retinal image quality occurs
   some time after a blink. It does not appear that a loss in optical
   quality is the trigger of normal blinking.}},

Title = {{Numerical simulations of mesoscale variabilityin the Straits of Florida}},

Abstract = {{The circulation in the Straits of Florida is dominated by the
   throughflow of the Florida Current, as modified by tidal flows,
   responses to atmospheric cold front and extratropical cyclone (easterly
   wave and tropical cyclone) passages in winter (summer), and intrinsic
   mesoscale variability due to instabilities of the Florida Current front
   and jet system. Monthly meanders of the Florida Current, persistent
   oceanic fronts associated with the Florida Current's baroclinic jet, and
   frontal eddies shed weekly by the Florida Current are the primary
   mesoscale features. A limited area model (Princeton Ocean Model: POM) is
   implemented to cover the Straits of Florida with a curvilinear grid that
   resolves the mesoscale structure, especially where the baroclinic flow
   is locked to steep topography in a 90 degree bend of the Straits.
   Florida Current cyclonic frontal eddies are spawned spontaneously, grow
   as they translate downstream, interact with shelf waters, and exhibit
   the same space-time attributes that characterize their observed
   counterparts, as evidenced by satellite imagery, shipboard synoptic
   mapping, coastal HF radar, and moored time series. Here, a deeper
   understanding is attempted for the frontal eddy kinematics and dynamics
   by examining, for example, their sensitivity to model parameter values,
   synoptic versus monthly atmospheric forcing, and other determinants of
   the flow. The mean flow shears are concentrated along the shelfbreak,
   where these frontal eddies are trapped, favoring the formation of the
   eddies by mean flow instabilities. In particular, it is found that the
   Florida Current frontal eddies exist independent of the wind-forcing
   considered (i.e., no winds, monthly winds, and synoptic (but not
   mesoscale) winds); however, they are modulated by the synoptic
   wind-forcing. Nevertheless, intriguingly, the frontal eddies have the
   same weekly time scale as the weather cycle.}},

Abstract = {{All previous aging research on the contractility of rodent skeletal
   muscle has been conducted on male rodents. Because males and females age
   differently, we undertook this study to determine if and when
   age-related decrements in skeletal muscle contractility occur in female
   mice. Soleus and extensor digitorum, longus (EDL) muscles from female
   C57BL/6 mice aged similar to 4, 8, 16, 24 and 28 mo were assessed in
   vitro for contractility and subsequently contractile protein content.
   EDL muscle was resistant to age-related changes in force generation but
   displayed characteristics of becoming more slow-twitch like. Maximal
   isometric tetanic force (PO) generated by soleus muscle declined with
   age. Soleus muscle size and contractile protein contents were not
   affected by age and thus could not explain the age-related force
   decrements. Soleus muscle specific P-O declined with age being similar
   to 26\% lower in muscles of 16-28 mo-old mice indicating that a
   deterioration in soleus muscle quality of female mice occurred beginning
   around the age of ovarian failure. Thus this study provides essential,
   comprehensive baseline data for future studies on age-related muscle
   dysfunction in the female mouse. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Yeast deletion models have general utility for the study of a variety of
   inherited metabolic disorders. Mutations in the mitochondrial ornithine
   transporter result in hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia,
   homocitrullinuria syndrome, a disorder of the urea cycle. To study the
   effects of mutations in a model system that more closely resembles the
   in vivo environment, we have developed an expression system based on a
   yeast strain lacking its endogenous ornithine transporter homologue.
   Wild-type human ornithine transporter and a recurrent mutation, Delta
   F188, were expressed and characterized with this system. The wild-type
   transporter appeared to insert into yeast mitochondria in the same
   orientation as in mammalian mitochondria. It showed stereospecificity,
   strong antiport activity and ornithine transport was competed by
   citrulline and arginine. The Delta F188 mutant was not incorporated into
   the membrane to the same extent as wild type, but retained significant
   residual activity and lost stereo specificity. In these isolated
   mitochondria, samarium chloride was found to be a potent blocker of
   transport compared to previously reported sulfhydryl-based inhibitors. A
   low-affinity background transport activity that promoted the exchange of
   ornithine for either acidic or basic amino acids was observed. This
   yeast model can readily be extended to the study of protein:protein
   interactions. In this manner, the use of yeast deletion strains can
   serve as a general framework to perform metabolic pathway analysis. (c)

Abstract = {{In this paper, drawing on in-depth interviews, we illustrate that
   despite the significant overall increase in the wealth of older
   Australians over the last two decades, a sizeable proportion of older
   Australians (65 and over) are in a vulnerable accommodation situation
   and many face the possibility of finding themselves homeless. This is
   especially so for those older Australians who are dependent on
   government for their income and are living in private rented
   accommodation. We show that the changing nature of the housing market
   means that often our informants were not able to find affordable,
   adequate and secure accommodation. The death of a spouse, rent increases
   and eviction are common precipitators of a slide into a situation of
   imminent homelessness. The restructuring of the welfare state and the
   virtual freeze on the building of social housing means that older
   private renters who face eviction often have nowhere to turn. Besides
   not being able to rely on the market or government, many have minimal or
   no family and social networks.}},

Title = {{The effects of unilateral muscle fatigue on bilateral physiological
   tremor}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{167}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{609-621}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the postexercise effects of
   fatiguing the wrist extensor muscles of a single arm on postural tremor
   and muscle activity in both arms. Previous research has shown that, for
   neurologically normal subjects, the tremor seen within a single limb
   segment is uncorrelated to that seen contralaterally. However it has
   been speculated that some bilateral relation does exist, and that the
   nature of the relation may only become evident under conditions where
   the neuromuscular system is perturbed. To further investigate this
   potential bilateral relation, seven healthy subjects were required to
   adopt a bilateral postural pointing position after exercise- induced
   fatigue of the wrist extensor muscles of a single arm. Tremor from the
   forearm, hand and finger segments of each arm, surface EMG activity from
   extensor digitorum ( ED) of each arm, and blood lactate data were
   collected prior to and after the exercise intervention. The main result
   was that fatiguing the distal muscles of one arm resulted in a bilateral
   increase in both the physiological tremor and ED activity. The change in
   tremor was confirmed to the index finger with no change in the tremor
   for the hand or forearm segments of either arm. While three peaks were
   seen in the frequency profile of the finger tremor, the effects of
   fatigue were confined to an increase in the peak power of the neurally
   generated 8 - 12 Hz tremor component. The contralateral increase in
   muscle activity was also reflected by a change in the frequency profile
   of EMG output, with an increase in the peak power of both muscles
   following exercise of the wrist extensors of a single arm. The bilateral
   increases in physiological tremor and EMG activity of ED were only
   observed during the bilateral pointing task, with no changes in tremor
   or EMG activity seen for the non- exercised limb during the unilateral
   exercise protocol. The speci. city of the resultant increases in the
   neurally generated 8 - 12 Hz component of finger tremor amplitude and
   EMG activity, coupled with the lack of any changes in tremor for the
   more proximal arm segments, indicate that these bilateral effects were
   mediated by an increase in the central neural drive to both limbs.
   Together this set of results challenges the general assumption of
   bilateral independence of tremor production, and further illustrate the
   task dependent nature of exercise- induced fatigue.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the influence of IL-1 on the arterial response
   to experimental injury in porcine models of percutancous coronary
   intervention (PCI).
   Methods: An intravenous (i.v.) bolus of 0.5 mg/kg followed by a
   subcutaneous (s.c.) infitision of 2 mg/kg/24 h of human IL-1 receptor
   antagonist (IL-1ra) inhibited neutrophil recruitment in response to
   intradermal IL-1. Using this dose regimen, five groups of pigs were
   studied: Group 1, oversized balloon angioplasty of 2 coronary vessels
   (14-day infusion, 28th day sacrifice and analysis); Groups 2, 3, 4, and
   5, oversized stenting of 2 coronary vessels (Group 2: 14-day infitision,
   28th day analysis; Group 3: 14-day infusion, 14th day analysis; Group 4:
   28-day infusion, 28th day analysis; Group 5: 28-day infusion, 90th day
   analysis). Neointimal area was quantified by standard means.
   Results: In Group 1, IL-1ra resulted in a 23\% decrease in neointimial
   area (p=0.04); in Group 2, a 34\% increase (p=0.001); in Group 3, a 38\%
   decrease (p<0.0001); in Group 4, a 34\% decrease (p=0.0004); and in
   Group 5, a 41\% decrease (p=0.00001).
   Conclusions: IL-Ira was associated with a sustained, significant
   reduction in neointima after vessel wall injury as long as it is given
   for the duration of the stimulation of the IL-1 system, in this case at
   least 28 days. This suggests that therapies based on the antagonism of
   IL-1 may modulate the coronary artery response to injury. (c) 2005

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2005}},

Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Propagation of three-dimensional dust-ion-acoustic solitons is
   investigated in a dusty plasma consisting of positive ions, negatively
   variable-charged dust particles, and two-temperature trapped electrons.
   We use the reductive perturbation theory to reduce the basic set of
   fluid equations to one evolution equation called damped modified
   Kadontsev-Petviashivili equation. Exact solution of this equation is not
   possible, so we obtain the time evolution solitary wave form approximate
   solution. It is found that only compressive soliton can propagate in
   this system. We develop a theoretical estimate condition under which the
   solitons can propagate. It is found that this condition is satisfied for
   Saturn's F ring. It is found also that low electron temperature has a
   role on the behavior of the soliton width, i.e., for lower (higher)
   range of low electron temperature the soliton width decreases
   (increases). However, high electron temperature decreases the width. The
   trapped electrons have no effect on the soliton width. The ratio of free
   low (high) to trapped low (high) electron temperatures increases the
   soliton amplitude. Also, the amplitude increases with free low and free
   high electron temperatures. To investigate the stabilty of the waves, we
   used a method based on energy consideration to obtain a condition for
   stable solitons. It is found that this condition depends on dust charge
   variation, streaming velocity, directional cosine of the wave vector k
   along the x axis, and temperatures of dust particles, ions, and free
   electrons. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Plant development is regulated by numerous chemicals derived from a
   multitude of metabolic pathways. However, we know very little about the
   biological effects and functions of many of these metabolites in the
   cell. N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are a group of lipid mediators that
   play important roles in mammalian physiology. Despite the intriguing
   similarities between animals and plants in NAE metabolism and
   perception, not much is known about the precise function of these
   metabolites in plant physiology. In plants, NAEs have been shown to
   inhibit phospholipase D alpha (PLD alpha) activity, interfere with
   abscisic acid-induced stomatal closure, and retard Arabidopsis seedling
   development. 1-Butanol, an antagonist of PLD-dependent phosphatidic acid
   production, was reported to induce defects in Arabidopsis seedling
   development that were somewhat similar to effects induced by elevated
   levels of NAE. This raised the possibility that the impact of NAE on
   seedling growth could be mediated in part via its influence on PLD
   activity. To begin to address this possibility, we conducted a detailed,
   comparative analysis of the effects of 1-butanol and
   N-lauroylethanolamine (NAE 12:0) on Arabidopsis root cell division, in
   vivo cytoskeletal organization, seed germination, and seedling growth.
   Although both NAE 12:0 and 1-butanol induced profound cytoskeletal and
   morphological alterations in seedlings, there were distinct differences
   in their overall effects. 1-Butanol induced more pronounced
   modifications in cytoskeletal organization, seedling growth, and cell
   division at concentrations severalfold higher than NAE 12:0. We propose
   that these compounds mediate their differential effects on cellular
   organization and seedling growth, in part through the differential
   modulation of specific PLD isoforms.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Studies from the colorectal literature have shown that
   factors associated with anastornotic leak after colorectal resection
   include long surgical time (> 2 h), multiple blood transfusions, and
   short distance to the anal verge. The aim of this study was to assess
   the morbidity associated with en bloc resection of ovarian carcinoma
   with low anterior resection and anastomosis in patients undergoing
   primary cytoreductive surgery for advanced disease.
   Methods. We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who
   bad undergone primary cytoreduction for advanced epithelial ovarian
   cancer with rectosigmoid resection followed by low rectal anastomosis
   between January 1994 and June 2004. Patient characteristics, operative
   details, and postoperative complications were extracted from patients'
   charts.
   Results. Seventy patients met the above criteria and form our study
   group. The median age was 59 years (range, 25-82). There were 52 stage
   IIIC (74\%) and 18 stage IV (26\%) cancers. The median operating time
   was 315 min (range, 120-750) and the median estimated blood loss was
   1200 rut (range, 250-8000), with 53 (76\%) patients requiring blood
   transfusion. Twenty-eight patients (40\%) underwent major upper
   abdominal procedures other than omentectomy, and 14 patients (20\%)
   underwent a second bowel resection. Twelve patients (17\%) underwent a
   protective ileostomy while the remainder (83\%) did not. Of the 58
   patients with no ostomy, the only complications associated with the
   resection and anastomoses were a pelvic abscess in 3 patients (5\%) and
   an anastornotic teak requiring diverting colostomy in 1 patient (1.7\%).
   Of the 12 patients who had protective ileostomies, 3 (25\%) had
   complications related to their ileostomy short-bowel syndrome requiring
   early reversal, incarceration of the prolapsed loop requiring surgical
   correction, and prolapse corrected electively at the time of second-look
   surgery.
   Conclusions. In women undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery, the
   morbidity associated with en bloc resection of ovarian carcinoma with
   low rectosigmoid resection and anastomosis without protective ileostomy
   was acceptably low, with an anastornotic leak rate of less than 2\%.
   Protective ileostomy is not always necessary and should be used
   selectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is
   clinically defined by familial clustering of colorectal cancer and other
   associated tumours.
   Methods: By thorough molecular and clinical evaluation of 41 families,
   two different groups were characterised: group 1, 25 families with
   truncating mutations in MLH1 or MSH2 (12 novel mutations); and group 2,
   16 Amsterdam positive families without mutations in these genes and
   without microsatellite instability in their corresponding tumours.
   Results: Significant clinical differences between these two groups were
   found. Firstly, earlier age of onset for all colorectal cancers (median
   41 v 55 years; p<0.001) and all tumours (median 43 v 56 years; p =
   0.022) was observed, comparing groups 1 and 2. Secondly, 68\% of the
   index colorectal cancers were localised proximally of the splenic
   flexure in group 1 compared with 14\% in group 2 (p<0.010). Thirdly,
   more synchronous and metachronous colorectal (p = 0.017) and
   extracolorectal tumours (p<0.001) were found in group 1. Fourthly, a
   higher colorectal adenoma/carcinoma ratio (p = 0.030) and a tendency
   towards more synchronous or metachronous adenomas in group 2 (p = 0.084)
   was observed, indicating a slower progression of adenomas to carcinomas.
   As three mutation negative tumours revealed chromosomal instability
   after comparative genomic hybridisation, these tumours may be caused by
   one or more highly penetrant disease alleles from the chromosomal
   instability pathway.
   Conclusion: These data show that HNPCC includes at least two entities
   with clinical and molecular differences. This will have implications for
   surveillance programmes and for cancer research.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: We conducted a prospective double-blinded placebo-controlled
   randomized trial to investigate the effect of ketorolac trometamol (KT)
   administered intravenously as premedication in colonoscopy.
   METHODS: One hundred and forty patients undergoing colonoscopy were
   randomized to receive either 60 mg of KT (KT group (KTG), n = 70) or
   placebo (normal saline group (NSG), n = 70) intravenously as
   premedication 30 min prior to procedure. Patient-controlled sedation
   (PCS) was used as the mode of sedation. Outcome measures included
   patient self-assessed pain score in a 10-cm unscaled visual analog scale
   (VAS), endoscopist assessment of patient pain score in VAS, patient's
   willingness to repeat colonoscopy, administered and demanded doses of
   PCS, patient satisfaction score in VAS, and hemodynamic changes during
   and after the procedure.
   RESULTS: The mean patient self-assessed pain score (SD) during procedure
   was significantly lower in KTG than NSG: 5.08 (2.74) vs 6.62 (2.45); p=
   0.001. The mean endoscopist assessment of patient pain score (SD) was
   significantly lower in KTG than NSG as well: 3.99 (2.80) vs 5.28 (2.71);
   p= 0.006. More patients in KTG were willing to repeat procedure as
   compared with NSG (80.0\%vs 57.1\%; p= 0.004). No significant difference
   was found in the administered and demanded doses of PCS, mean
   satisfactory scores and hemodynamic changes in both groups. No serious
   complication related to intravenous (IV) KT was noted.
   CONCLUSIONS: Premedication with IV KT (Toradol((R))) improves pain
   control during colonoscopy with no associated serious complications.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Community pharmacists, pharmaceutical industry and
   differences in prescribing between GPs.
   Objective. To explore the role of the pharmacists and pharmaceutical
   industry representatives.
   Methods. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken of 1434 GPs in The
   Netherlands in 2001. Prescribing indicators based on general practice
   guidelines were used to assess the quality of prescribing. Three
   constructs, based on survey questions, were used as possible
   determinants for the quality of prescribing: cooperation with the
   pharmacist; quality of the Pharmacotherapeutic audit meeting (PTAM); and
   the GP's attitude towards the pharmacist's role. Data were collected
   about the frequency of visits by pharmaceutical industry
   representatives. Responses from 324 solo GPs were analysed using
   multiple linear regression.
   Results. Response rate: 71\%. For the 324 solo GPs the average score for
   the 20 prescribing indicators was 64\% (SD 3.7). For the non-solo GPs
   this score was 65\% (SD 3.8, P < 0.05). The differences between solo and
   group practices were: the number of visits from pharmaceutical industry
   representatives (5.7 versus 3.8 visits per month), full time GPs (93\%
   versus 50\%), the number of patients per GP (2151, SD 693 versus 1506,
   SD 742), and the presence of a GP trainer (21 versus 38\%). Of the solo
   GPs, 4.6\% are female, compared with 26\% of the GPs in non-solo
   practices. The quality of prescribing in solo practices was not
   correlated with the GP's attitude towards the pharmacist's role, the way
   in which GPs cooperated with pharmacists or the quality of the PTAM.
   More frequent visits from pharmaceutical industry representatives was
   associated with a lower quality of prescribing.
   Conclusion. There was a negative correlation between quality of
   prescribing by solo GPs and frequency of visits by pharmaceutical
   industry representatives. In day-to-day practice, no measurable effects
   of the cooperation between solo GP and pharmacist on the quality of
   prescribing were observed.}},

Abstract = {{A recurring objective in longitudinal studies on aging and longevity has
   been the investigation of the relationship between age-at-death and
   current values of a longitudinal covariate trajectory that quantifies
   reproductive or other behavioral activity. We propose a novel technique
   for predicting age-at-death distributions for situations where an entire
   covariate history is included in the predictor. The predictor
   trajectories up to current time are represented by time-varying
   functional principal component scores, which are continuously updated as
   time progresses and are considered to be time-varying predictor
   variables that are entered into a class of time-varying functional
   regression models that we propose. We demonstrate for biodemographic
   data how these methods can be applied to obtain predictions for
   age-at-death and estimates of remaining lifetime distributions,
   including estimates of quantiles and of prediction intervals for
   remaining lifetime. Estimates and predictions are obtained for
   individual subjects, based on their observed behavioral trajectories,
   and include a dimension-reduction step that is implemented by projecting
   on a single index. The proposed techniques are illustrated with data on
   longitudinal daily egg-laying for female medflies, predicting remaining
   lifetime and age-at-death distributions from individual event histories
   observed up to current time.}},

Abstract = {{The cause of primary dystonia remains unknown. Several reports point to
   immune system disturbances in primary dystonia and a recent Study
   demonstrated hyperhomocysteinemia in cervical dystonia. Homocysteine

   associated with immune system activation and increased neopterin serum
   concentrations. We examined HCY serum concentrations together with serum
   markers of immune activation in patients with different types of primary
   dystonia. Eighty-three patients with different types of primary dystonia
   were included and investigated at least 3 months following botulinum
   toxin treatment. Thirty-six healthy volunteers with similar age and sex
   distribution served as controls. Total serum HCY, kynurenine, and
   tryptophan concentrations were determined by highperformance liquid
   chromatography; neopterin, folate, and vitamin B12 concentrations were
   measured by immunoassays. Routine blood analysis, including C-reactive
   protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood
   count (WBC), was performed. Patients with primary dystonia had
   significantly higher HCY concentrations compared to controls. Among the
   dystonia subtypes, no significant difference of HCY serum concentrations
   was observed. CRP and ESR were within the normal range in >90\% of the
   patients and all had normal WBC. Neopterin, kynurenine, and tryptophan
   serum concentrations were similar in patients and controls and not
   correlated with HCY serum concentrations. The results provide evidence
   against enhanced cellular immune activation in patients with primary
   dystonia. However, hyperhomocysteinemia was present in all dystonia
   subtypes and unrelated to immune activation in this study. HCY is a
   neuronal excitotoxic amino acid and hyperhomocysteinemia is considered
   an independent vascular risk factor. Further studies are required to
   define the background of hyperhomocysteinemia in primary dystonia. (c)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we compiled previous investigations and summarize recent
   results to show that the Lanzo peridotite records a sequence of deep
   lithospheric igneous events that largely obliterated the previous
   subcontinental history. Field, microtextural and trace element data
   indicate the progressive evolution of an igneous system that forms above
   an upwelling asthenosphere, most probably during the transition from a
   rifted system to the establishment of an (ultra-) slow spreading ridge
   of the Piedmont Ligurian ocean. Pervasive porous flow of melt forming
   `reactive' spinel peridotites followed by plagioclase peridotite is
   later replaced by focused porous flow, reflected by a system of
   replacive harzburgite and dunites. Cooling of the Lanzo peridotite leads
   to the interstitial crystallization of clinopyroxene and plagioclase,
   and finally to the formation of gabbro dikes. Thus, the Lanzo
   peridotites may indicate that extension-driven `as-thenospherization' of
   lithospheric mantle is an important process in the development of
   embryonic ocean basins.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of the operation of a series-L/parallel-tuned class-E
   amplifier and its equivalence to the classic shunt-C/series-tuned
   class-E amplifier are presented. The first reported closed form design
   equations for the series-L/parallel-tuned topology operating under ideal
   switching conditions are given. Furthermore, a design procedure is
   introduced that allows the effect that nonzero switch resistance has on
   amplifier performance efficiency to be accounted for. The technique
   developed allows optimal circuit components to be found for a given
   device series resistance. For a relatively high value of switching
   device ON series resistance of 40, drain efficiency of around 66\% for
   the series-L/parallel-tuned topology, and 73\% for the
   shunt-C/series-tuned topology appear to be the theoretical limits. At
   lower switching device series resistance levels, the efficiency
   performance of each type are similar,. but the series-L/parallel-tuned
   topology offers some advantages in terms of its potential for MMIC
   realisation. Theoretical analysis is confirmed by numerical simulation
   for a 500mW (27dBm), 10\% bandwidth, 5V series-L/parallel-tuned, then,
   shunt-C/series-tuned class E power amplifier, operating at 2.5 GHz,. and
   excellent agreement between theory and simulation results is achieved.
   The theoretical work presented in the paper should facilitate the design
   of high-efficiency switched amplifiers at frequencies commensurate with
   the needs of modem mobile wireless applications in the microwave
   frequency range, where intrinsically low-output-capacitance MMIC
   switching devices such as pHEMTs are to be used.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonella is the most important human pathogen associated with shell
   eggs. Salmonella Enteritidis is the serotype most often implicated in
   outbreaks, although other serotypes have been recovered from eggs and
   from the commercial shell egg washing environment. Many sample methods
   are used to recover microorganisms from eggshells and membranes. A shell
   rinse and modified shell-and-membrane crush method for recovery of
   Salmonella were compared. Eggs were collected from 3 commercial
   shell-washing facilities (X, Y, and Z) during 3 visits. Twelve eggs were
   collected from each of 10 to 12 locations along the egg processing
   chain. After being transported back to the laboratory, each egg was
   sampled first by a shell rinse method and then by a shell crush method.
   For each technique (rinse or crush), 2 pools of 5 eggs per location
   sampled were selectively enriched for the recovery of Salmonella.
   Presumptive samples positive for Salmonella were confirmed
   serologically. Overall, there were 10.1\% (40/396) Salmonella-positive
   pooled samples. Salmonella were recovered by the shell rinse and shell
   crush techniques (4.8 vs. 5.3\%, respectively). Plant X yielded 21.5\%
   Salmonella positives, whereas less than 5\% of samples from plants Y and
   Z were found to be contaminated with the organism (4.2 and 4.5\%,
   respectively). Salmonella was recovered more often from unwashed eggs
   (15.8\%) than from washed eggs (8.3\%). For some eggs, Salmonella was
   only recovered by one of the methods. Use of both approaches in the same
   experiment increased sampling sensitivity, although in most cases,
   crushing provided more sensitive Salmonella recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previously we reported that immunohistochemical examination
   of p53, bcl-2, glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi), thymidylate
   synthase (TS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in biopsy
   samples was a useful method for predicting clinical outcome of gastric
   cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. Here, we
   investigated if these biological markers can predict chemoresponse and
   survival of unresectable gastric cancer patients treated with irinotecan
   and cisplatin.
   Methods: The subjects were 55 unresectable gastric cancer patients
   treated with irinotecan (70 mg/m(2), Days 1 and 15) and cisplatin (80
   mg/m(2), Day 1). Expression of p53, bcl-2, VEGF was examined
   immunohistochemically in biopsy samples.
   Results: The overall response rate and the median survival time were
   55\% (30/55) and 321 days, respectively. Thirty patients with
   intestinal-type adenocarcinoma survived longer than 25 patients with
   diffuse-type (median survival time: 446, 259 days, P = 0.013). The
   favorable phenotypes for chemoresponse were p53-negative, bcl-2-negative
   and VEGF-positive, which were in accordance with previous findings. The
   response rate was significantly correlated with the total number of
   these favorable phenotypes (P = 0.043). The 39 patients having 2 or 3
   favorable phenotypes (p53-negative, bcl-2-negative and VEGF-positive)
   survived longer than the remaining 16 patients (median survival time:
   444, 259 days, P = 0.021). In the Cox model, the number of the favorable
   phenotypes showed a tendency to correlate with survival after adjustment
   for potentially prognostic factors such as histological type or
   performance status (P = 0.070).
   Conclusions: Immunohistochemical examination of biological markers may
   be useful in predicting the clinical outcome of unresectable gastric
   cancer patients treated with irinotecan and cisplatin.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of combined radiation and targeted,
   intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin infusions (RADPLAT) in patients with
   advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tonsil.
   STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective study of treatment outcomes and
   toxicity of patients enrolled on the RADPLAT protocol, with specific
   analysis of patients with advanced SCC of the tonsil.
   RESULTS: Thirty patients with advanced tonsil carcinoma (17 T-4, 12 T-3,
   1 T-2) were enrolled, and 24 of 30 patients completed at least 3 IA
   cisplatin infusions and a minimum of 63 Gy or radiation therapy (minimum
   therapy). Two-year estimated overall and disease-specific survival was
   42\% and 50\%. respectively, for all 30 patients (intent-to-treat group)
   and 49\% and 58\%, respectively, for the minimum therapy subgroup. The
   2-year estimated local and regional disease control was 87\% and 90\%,
   respectively, for the intent-to-treat group, and 100\% and 90\% for the
   minimum therapy subgroup. Functional organ preservation was achieved in
   92\% of patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Locoregional disease control achieved with this regimen
   appears to be significantly improved over that described in the
   literature for similarly staged tonsil cancer. Survival, on the other
   hand, remains comparable.}},

Abstract = {{The preventive effects of glycomacropeptide (GMP) against intestinal
   infection were investigated, and conjugates of GMP with
   xylooligosaccharide (XOS) and carboxymethyldextran (CMD) were prepared
   by the Maillard reaction to enhance the effect of GMP. The binding
   ability of GMP to intestinal pathogenic bacteria was evaluated by a
   binding assay with biotinylated bacteria. GMP showed the ability to bind
   to Salmonella enteritidis and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7
   (EHEC O157). This binding ability was decreased by a sialidase treatment
   and completely eliminated by periodate oxidation. These results indicate
   that such carbohydrate moieties as sialic acid in GMP are involved in
   binding to S. enteritidis and EHEC O157. The preventive effect of GMP on
   the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to Caco-2 cells was also
   investigated. GMP showed an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of EHEC
   O157 in a dose-dependent manner, although it was not a potent inhibitor
   of the adhesion of Salmonella infection. However, in the case of
   Salmonella infection, GMP-XOS and GMP-CMD significantly suppressed IL-8
   production which was the index of infection. Our results indicate GMP to
   be a promising agent for preventing intestinal infection.}},

Abstract = {{To examine trends in predictors of HIV-related mortality among cohorts
   of persons living with AIDS (PLWA) in New York City (NYC), nine calendar
   year-specific cohorts of PLWA were created from 1993 to 2001. Cohorts
   were defined as persons who had been alive at any time during that year
   and had been diagnosed with AIDS before the end of that year. Predictors
   of death because of HIV-related causes of death were assessed by
   examining year-specific, stratified death rates per 1,000 PLWA and
   adjusted relative risks (RRs) from proportional hazards models. We
   conducted an analysis of AIDS surveillance data PLWA in NYC between 1993
   and 2001. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models
   were constructed for each calendar year cohort to evaluate trends in the
   RR of HIV-related death over the subsequent 5 years, adjusting for sex,
   race/ethnicity, age, transmission risk, borough of residence, category
   of AIDS diagnosis {[}opportunistic illness (OI) or CD4 count < 200
   cells/mu L], time since AIDS diagnosis, and CD4 count at time of AIDS
   diagnosis. Death rates due to all causes and HIV-related causes declined
   substantially during 1993-1997 and then stabilized in all subgroups of
   PLWA between 1998 and 2001. Beginning in 1995, differences in survival
   emerged in some subgroups, such that by 2001 (1) injecting drug users
   (IDUs) had poorer survival compared with men who have sex with men (MSM)
   {[}RR2001 = 2.1, 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) = 1.8-2.4]; (2)
   black and Hispanic PLWA had a significantly higher risk of death than
   white PLWA (RR2001 = 1.4, 95\% CI = 1.2-1.6, RR2001 = 1.2, 95\% CI =
   1.1-1.4, respectively, and (3) PLWA aged 60 and above had poorer
   survival compared with younger persons (RR2001 = 2.4, 95\% CI =
   1.9-3.0), after adjustment for other factors. The observed disparities
   that began to emerge in 1995 may be attributable to differential effects
   of, access to, or usage of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
   More targeted studies are needed to determine why such disparities have
   emerged.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The exact cause and appropriate treatment for cholestasis
   following liver transplantation in recipients with hepatitis C virus
   recurrence (RHCV) are difficult to determine. Our objective was to
   determine the diagnostic accuracy of clinical and histological
   parameters in liver transplant recipients with RHCV and concurrent
   cholestasis.
   Methods. A retrospective analysis from June 1996 to May 2003 was
   performed on adult liver transplant (OLT) recipients with hepatitis C
   virus. Patients with cholestasis (bilirubin > 5 mg/dL, 6 months after
   OLT) were selected. Demographics, etiology, immune suppression, clinical
   and histologic outcomes, and virologic features were evaluated. Patients
   were divided into two groups based on clinical and histological
   criteria: (1) patients with parameters suggestive of cholestatic HCV;
   and (2) patients with parameters consistent with acute cellular
   rejection.
   Results. Thirty-seven patients met study criteria (20 males). The
   average age was 54 years (range = 14-72), and time from transplant to
   jaundice was 769 days (range = 48-2981). The groups were comparable
   regarding HCV viral load, age, gender, time from transplant, and United
   Network of Organ Sharing status at time of transplant. Retransplantation
   was performed in two patients in group 1, neither of whom survived, and
   in three patients in group 2, all of whom survived. Clinical parameters
   correlated well with diagnosis of cholestasis (r = 0.85, P < .001)
   whereas histological evaluation did not (r = 0.11, P = .53). Mortality
   in group 1 was 78\% (7 of 9) vs. 50\% (13 of 26) in group 2. Median
   duration of survival following liver transplantation in group 1 was 132
   days versus 435 days in group 2.
   Conclusion. Clinical diagnosis parameters for RHCV with cholestasis
   appear more accurate than histology parameters and should be the primary
   consideration in directing therapy. Despite timely diagnosis,
   cholestatic RHCV LTx recipients have a poor prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{An orally active antiallergic agent, M50367, skews the Th1/Th2 balance
   toward Th1 dominance by suppressing naive Th cell differentiation into
   Th2 cells in vitro. Administration results in the suppression of IgE
   synthesis and peritoneal eosinophilia in vivo. In this report, we
   determined that M50354 (an active metabolite of M50367) was a ligand for
   the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR); the immunological effects of this
   compound on in vitro Th1/Th2 differentiation from naive Th cells and
   Th1/Th2 balance in vivo were manifested through binding to AhR. These
   effects were completely abolished in AhR-deficient mice. AhR expression
   in the naive Th cell was significantly up-regulated by costimulation of
   TCR and CD28. Suppression of naive Th cell differentiation into Th2
   cells via binding of M50354 to AhR was associated with inhibition of
   GATA-3 expression in Th cells. In addition, forced expression of a
   constitutively active form of AhR or activation of AhR by the addition
   of representative ligands suppressed naive Th cell differentiation into
   Th2 cells. Based on these results, we conclude that AhR functions as a
   modulator of the in vivo Th1/Th2 balance through activation in naive Th

Abstract = {{A work and power ( energy) analysis of the golf swing is presented as a
   method for evaluating the mechanics of the golf swing. Two computer
   models were used to estimate the energy production, transfers, and
   conversions within the body and the golf club by employing standard
   methods of mechanics to calculate work of forces and torques, kinetic
   energies, strain energies, and power during the golf swing. A detailed
   model of the golf club determined the energy transfers and conversions
   within the club during the downswing. A full-body computer model of the
   golfer determined the internal work produced at the body joints during
   the downswing. Four diverse amateur subjects were analyzed and compared
   using these two models. The energy approach yielded new information on
   swing mechanics, determined the force and torque components that
   accelerated the club, illustrated which segments of the body produced
   work, determined the timing of internal work generation, measured swing
   efficiencies, calculated shaft energy storage and release, and proved
   that forces and range of motion were equally important in developing
   club head velocity. A more comprehensive description of the downswing
   emerged from information derived from an energy based analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of the genome sequence of Caulobacter crescentus predicts 67
   TonB-dependent outer membrane proteins. To demonstrate that among them
   are proteins that transport nutrients other than chelated Fe3+ and
   vitamin B-12-the substrates hitherto known to be transported by
   TonB-dependent transporters-the outer membrane protein profile of cells
   grown on different substrates was determined by two-dimensional
   electrophoresis. Maltose induced the synthesis of a hitherto unknown
   99.5-kDa protein, designated here as MalA, encoded by the cc2287 genomic
   locus. MalA mediated growth on maltodextrins and transported {[}C-14]
   maltodextrins from {[}C-14]maltose to {[}C-14]maltopentaose. {[}C-14]
   maltose transport showed biphasic kinetics, with a fast initial rate and
   a slower second rate. The initial transport had a K-d of 0.2 mu M, while
   the second transport had a K-d of 5 mu M. It is proposed that the fast
   rate reflects binding to MalA and the second rate reflects transport
   into the cells. Energy depletion of cells by 100 mu M carbonyl] cyanide
   3-chlorophenylhydrazone abolished maltose binding and transport.
   Deletion of the malA gene diminished maltose transport to 1\% of the
   wild-type malA strain and impaired transport of the larger
   maltodextrins. The malA mutant was unable to grow on maltodextrins
   larger than maltotetraose. Deletion of two C crescentus genes homologous
   to the exbB exbD genes of Escherichia coli abolished {[}C-14]
   maltodextrin binding and transport and growth on maltodextrins larger
   than maltotetraose. These mutants also showed impaired growth on
   Fe3+-rhodotorulate as the sole iron source, which provided evidence of
   energy-coupled transport. Unexpectedly, a deletion mutant of a tonB
   homolog transported maltose at the wild-type rate and grew on all
   maltodextrins tested. Since Fe3+-rhodotorulate served as an iron source
   for the tonB mutant, an additional gene encoding a protein with a TonB
   function is postulated. Permeation of maltose and maltotriose through
   the outer membrane of the C crescentus malA mutant was slower than
   permeation through the outer membrane of an E. coli lamB mutant, which
   suggests a low porin activity in C crescentus. The pores of the C
   crescentus porins are slightly larger than those of E. coli K-12, since
   maltotetraose supported growth of the C crescentus malA mutant but
   failed to support growth of the E. coli lamB mutant. The data are
   consistent with the proposal that binding of maltodextrins to MalA
   requires energy and MalA actively transports maltodextrins with K-d
   values 1,000-fold smaller than those for the LamB porin and 100-fold
   larger than those for the vitamin B-12 and ferric siderophore outer
   membrane transporters. MalA is the first example of an outer membrane
   protein for which an ExbB/ExbD-dependent transport of a nutrient other
   than iron and vitamin B-12 has been demonstrated.}},

   specific genes, generating Type I markers. Using an in silico approach,
   we identified 1975 SSRs from the Genome Research on Atlantic Salmon
   Project EST database. We designed primers to amplify 158 SSRs, of which
   65 amplified 76 loci (including 11 duplicated loci). Sixty-one of the 76
   loci were variable in 24 Atlantic salmon from seven populations, and
   96\% of these markers also amplify DNA from other salmonids. Functions
   for 16 of the SSR associated ESTs have been determined, confirming them
   as Type I markers.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of spliceosomal introns remains poorly understood.
   Although many approaches have been used to infer intron evolution from
   the patterns of intron position conservation, the results to date have
   been contradictory. In this paper, we address the problem using a novel
   maximum likelihood method, which allows estimation of the frequency of
   intron insertion target sites, together with the rates of intron gain
   and loss. We analyzed the pattern of 10,044 introns (7,221 intron
   positions) in the conserved regions of 684 sets of orthologs from seven
   eukaryotes. We determined that there is an average of one target site
   per 11.86 base pairs (bp) (95\% confidence interval, 9.27 to 14.39 bp).
   In addition, our results showed that: (i) overall intron gains are; 25\%
   greater than intron losses, although specific patterns vary with time
   and lineage; (ii) parallel gains account for; 18.5\% of shared intron
   positions; and (iii) reacquisition following loss accounts for; 0.5\% of
   all intron positions. Our results should assist in resolving the
   long-standing problem of inferring the evolution of spliceosomal
   introns.}},

Abstract = {{The hyperbolic spin chain is used to elucidate the notion of spontaneous
   symmetry breaking for a non-amenable internal symmetry group, here SO(
   1, 2). The noncompact symmetry is shown to be spontaneously broken -
   something which would be forbidden for a compact group by the
   Mermin-Wagner theorem. Expectation functionals are defined through the L
   --> infinity limit of a chain of length L; the functional measure is
   found to have its weight mostly on configurations boosted by an amount
   increasing at least powerlike with L. This entails that despite the
   non-amenability a certain subclass of noninvariant functions is averaged
   to an SO(1, 2) invariant result. Outside this class symmetry breaking is
   generic. Performing an Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction based on the
   infinite volume averages one finds that the reconstructed quantum theory
   is different from the original one. The reconstructed Hilbert space is
   nonseparable and contains a separable subspace of ground states of the
   reconstructed transfer operator on which SO( 1, 2) acts in a continuous,
   unitary, and irreducible way.}},

Abstract = {{The surface protein internalin A (InlA) contributes to the invasion of
   human intestinal epithelial cells by Listeria monocytogenes. Screening
   of L. monocytogenes strains isolated from human clinical cases (n = 46),
   foods (n = 118), and healthy animals (n = 58) in the United States
   revealed mutations in inlA leading to premature stop codons (PMSCs) in
   L. monocytogenes ribotypes DUP-1052A and DUP-16635A (PMSC mutation type
   1), DUP-1025A and DUP-1031A (PMSC mutation type 2), and DUP-1046B and
   DUP-1062A (PMSC mutation type 3). While all DUP-1046B, DUP-1062A,
   DUP-16635A, and DUP-1031A isolates (n = 76) contained inlA PMSCs,
   ribotypes DUP-1052A and DUP-1025A (n = 72) contained isolates with and
   without inlA PMSCs. Western immunoblotting showed that all three inl4
   PMSCs result in the production of truncated and secreted InlA. Searches
   of the Pathogen Tracker database, which contains subtype and source
   information for more than 5,000 L. monocytogenes isolates, revealed that
   the six ribotypes shown to contain isolates with inlA PMSCs were overall
   more commonly isolated from foods than from human listeriosis cases. L.
   monocytogenes strains carrying inlA PMSCs also showed significantly (P =
   0.0004) reduced invasion of Caco-2 cells compared to isolates with
   homologous 3' inlA sequences without PMSCs. Invasion assays with an
   isogenic PMSC mutant further supported the observation that inlA PMSCs
   lead to reduced invasion of Caco-2 cells. Our data show that specific L.
   monocytogenes subtypes which are common among U.S. food isolates but
   rare among human listeriosis isolates carry inlA mutations that are
   associated with, and possibly at least partially responsible for, an
   attenuated invasion phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Leaf age-dependent changes in structure, nitrogen content, internal
   mesophyll diffusion conductance (g(m)), the capacity for photosynthetic
   electron transport (J(max)) and the maximum carboxylase activity of
   Rubisco (V-cmax) were investigated in mature non-senescent leaves of
   Laurus nobilis L., Olea europea L. and Quercus ilex L. to test the
   hypothesis that the relative significance of biochemical and diffusion
   limitations of photosynthesis changes with leaf age. The leaf life-span
   was up to 3 years in L. nobilis and O. europea and 6 years in Q. ilex.
   Increases in leaf age resulted in enhanced leaf dry mass per unit area
   (MA), larger leaf dry to fresh mass ratio, and lower nitrogen contents
   per dry mass (N-M) in all species, and lower nitrogen contents per area
   (N-A) in L. nobilis and Q. ilex. Older leaves had lower g(m), J(max) and
   V-cmax Due to the age-dependent increase in M-A, mass-based g(m), J(max)
   and V-cmax declined more strongly (7- to 10-fold) with age than
   area-based (5- to 7-fold) characteristics. Diffusion conductance was
   positively associated with foliage photosynthetic potentials. However,
   this correlation was curvilinear, leading to lower ratio of
   chloroplastic to internal CO2 concentration (C-c/C-i) and larger
   drawdown Of CO2 from leaf internal air space to chloroplasts (Delta(c))
   in older leaves with lower g(m). Overall the age-dependent decreases in
   photosynthetic potentials were associated with decreases in N-M and in
   the fraction of N in photosynthetic proteins, whereas decreases in gm
   were associated with increases in MA and the fraction of cell walls.
   These age-dependent modifications altered the functional scaling of
   foliage photosynthetic potentials with M-A, N-M, and N-A. The species
   primarily differed in the rate of age-dependent modifications in foliage
   structural and functional characteristics, but also in the degree of
   age-dependent changes in various variables. Stomatal openness was weakly
   associated with leaf age, but due to species differences in stomatal
   openness, the distribution of total diffusion limitation between stomata
   and mesophyll varied among species. These data collectively demonstrate
   that in Mediterranean evergreens, structural limitations of
   photosynthesis strongly interact with biochemical limitations.
   Age-dependent changes in gm and photosynthetic capacities do not occur
   in a co-ordinated manner in these species such that mesophyll diffusion
   constraints curb photosynthesis more in older than in younger leaves.}},

Abstract = {{Six corn starch-LDPE film blends containing starch in the range 5-40 \%
   by weight, oleic acid as a Lewis catalyst with concentration of either 5
   \% or 10 \%, maleic anhydride as a coupling agent with concentration of
   either 2 \% or 10 \% and benzoyl peroxide as free radical initiator with
   concentration of either 0.1 \% or 0.25 \% were prepared. Fungal growth
   tests (ASTM G21) using Penicillium funiculosum were carried out on the
   samples made according to the above formulations. Tensile tests (ASTM
   D638) and SEM imaging were also carried out on the samples before and
   after incubation with Penicillium funiculosum for three weeks. The
   results of ASTM G21 test and SEM imaging showed that the increase in
   starch content from 5 \% to 40 \% in the formulations containing all
   three additive increases the biodegradability of the samples whereas
   increase in the concentration of oleic acid from 5 \% to 10 \% has an
   opposite effect. Formulations containing only 5 \% starch with a fairly
   high concentrations of additives or 40 \% starch with no additives
   supported none or very little growth after three weeks, which indicates
   the importance of the concentration of starch and the presence of
   additives on the biodegradability of starch-LDPE film blends. Tensile
   test results showed that increase in starch content in the range of
   20-30 \% leads to a decrease in the values of the tensile strength and
   increase-in the values of the elongation-at-break whereas further
   increase up to 40 \% has the opposite effect. Tests with blends
   containing 40 \% starch and no additive or 5 \% starch with a fairly
   high concentration of additives resulted in low yield stresses and high
   elongation-at-break values. Increase the concentration of oleic acid
   from 5 \% to 10 \% in the blends resulted in a decrease in both the
   yield stress and elongation-at-break values.}},

Title = {{Active metabolite of GLP-1 mediates myocardial glucose uptake and
   improves left ventricular performance in conscious dogs with dilated
   cardiomyopathy}},

Abstract = {{We have shown previously that the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-(7-36)
   amide increases myocardial glucose uptake and improves left ventricular
   (LV) and systemic hemodynamics in both conscious dogs with
   pacing-induced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and humans with LV systolic
   dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction. However, GLP-1-(7-36) is
   rapidly degraded in the plasma to GLP-1-(9-36) by dipeptidyl peptidase
   IV (DPP IV), raising the issue of which peptide is the active moiety. By
   way of methodology, we compared the efficacy of a 48-h continuous
   intravenous infusion of GLP-1-(7-36) (1.5 pmol (.) kg(-1) (.) min(-1))
   to GLP-1-(9-36) (1.5 pmol (.) kg(-1) (.) min(-1)) in 28 conscious,
   chronically instrumented dogs with pacing-induced DCM by measuring LV
   function and transmyocardial substrate uptake under basal and insulin
   stimulated conditions using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. As a
   result, dogs with DCM demonstrated myocardial insulin resistance under
   basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. Both GLP-1-(7-36) and
   GLP-1-(9-36) significantly reduced (P < 0.01) LV enddiastolic pressure
   {[}GLP-1-(7-36), 28 +/- 1 to 15 +/- 2 mmHg; GLP-1(9-36), 29 +/- 2 to 16
   +/- 1 mmHg] and significantly increased ( P < 0.01) the first derivative
   of LV pressure {[}GLP-1-(7-36), 1,315 +/- 81 to 2,195 +/- 102 mmHg/s;
   GLP-1-(9-36), 1,336 +/- 77 to 2,208 +/- 68 mmHg] and cardiac output
   {[}GLP-1-(7-36), 1.5 +/- 0.1 to 1.9 +/- 0.1 1/min; GLP-1-(9-36), 2.0 +/-
   0.1 to 2.4 +/- 0.05 1/min], whereas an equivolume infusion of saline had
   no effect. Both peptides increased myocardial glucose uptake but without
   a significant increase in plasma insulin. During the GLP-1-(9-36)
   infusion, negligible active (NH2-terminal) peptide was measured in the
   plasma. In conclusion, in DCM, GLP-1-(9-36) mimics the effects of
   GLP-1-(7-36) in stimulating myocardial glucose uptake and improving LV
   and systemic hemodynamics through insulinomimetic as opposed to
   insulinotropic effects. These data suggest that GLP-1-(9-36) amide is an
   active peptide.}},

Abstract = {{In situ X-ray diffraction measurements of KAlSi3O8-hollandite
   (K-hollandite) were performed at pressures of 15 - 27 GPa and
   temperatures of 300-1,800 K using a Kawai-type apparatus. Unit-cell
   volumes obtained at various pressure and temperature conditions in a
   series of measurements were fitted to the high-temperature
   Birch-Murnaghan equation of state and a complete set of thermoelastic
   parameters was obtained with an assumed K'(300,0) = 4. The determined
   parameters are V-300,V-0 = 237.6( 2) angstrom(3), K-300,K-0 = 183(3)
   GPa, (partial derivative K-T,K-0/partial derivative T)(P) = - 0.033( 2)
   GPa K-1, a(0) = 3.32(5) x 10(-5) K-1, and b(0) = 1.09(1) x 10(-8) K-2,
   where a(0) and b(0) are coefficients describing the zero-pressure
   thermal expansion: alpha(T,0) = a(0) + b(0) T. We observed broadening
   and splitting of diffraction peaks of K-hollandite at pressures of 20 -
   23 GPa and temperatures of 300 - 1,000 K. We attribute this to the phase
   transitions from hollandite to hollandite II that is an unquenchable
   high-pressure phase recently found. We determined the phase boundary to
   be P (GPa) = 16.6 + 0.007 T ( K). Using the equation of state parameters
   of K-hollandite determined in the present study, we calculated a density
   profile of a hypothetical continental crust (HCC), which consists only
   of K-hollandite, majorite garnet, and stishovite with 1: 1: 1 ratio in
   volume. Density of HCC is higher than the surrounding mantle by about
   0.2 g cm(-3) in the mantle transition zone while this relation is
   reversed below 660-km depth and HCC becomes less dense than the
   surrounding mantle by about 0.15 g cm(-3) in the uppermost lower mantle.
   Thus the 660-km seismic discontinuity can be a barrier to prevent the
   transportation of subducted continental crust materials to the lower
   mantle and the subducted continental crust may reside at the bottom of
   the mantle transition zone.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Meiotic recombination differs from mitotic recombination in that DSBs
   are repaired using homologous chromosomes, rather than sister
   chromatids. This change in partner choice is due in part to a barrier to
   sister chromatid repair (BSCR) created by the meiosis-specific kinase,
   Mek1, in a complex with two other meiosis-specific proteins, Hop1 and
   Red1. HOP1 contains two functional domains, called the N and C domains.
   Analysis of a point mutation that specifically inactivates the C domain
   (hop1-K593A) reveals that the N domain is sufficient for Hop1
   localization to chromosomes and for Red1 and Hop1 interactions. The C
   domain is needed for spore viability, for chromosome synapsis, and for
   preventing DMC1-independent DSB repair, indicating it plays a role in
   the BSCR. All of the hop1-K593A phenotypes can be bypassed by fusion of
   ectopic dimerization domains to Mek1, suggesting that the function of
   the C domain is to promote Mek1 dimerization. Hop1 is a DSB-dependent
   phosphoprotein, whose phosphorylation requires the presence of the C
   domain, but is independent of MEK1. These results suggest a model in
   which Hop1 phosphorylation in response to DSBs triggers dimerization of
   Mek1 via the Hop1 C domain, thereby enabling Mek1 to phosphorylate
   target proteins that prevent repair of DSBs by sister chromatids.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND CONCRETE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{439-454}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{When deterioration of concrete is observed in a structure, it is highly
   desirable to determine the cause of such deterioration. Only by
   understanding the cause can an appropriate repair strategy be
   implemented to address both the cause and the symptom. In colder
   climates, bridge deck deterioration is often caused by chlorides from
   de-icing salts, which penetrate the concrete and depassivate the
   embedded reinforcement, causing corrosion. Bridge decks can also suffer
   from other deterioration mechanisms, such as alkali-silica reaction,
   freeze-thaw, and shrinkage. There is a need for a comprehensive and
   integrative system to help with the inspection and evaluation of
   concrete bridge deck deterioration before decisions are made on the best
   way to repair it. The purpose of this research was to develop a model to
   help with the diagnosis of concrete bridge deck deterioration that
   integrates the symptoms observed during an inspection, various
   deterioration mechanisms, and the probability of their occurrence given
   the available data. The model displays the diagnosis result as the
   probability that one of four deterioration mechanisms, namely shrinkage,
   corrosion of reinforcement, freeze-thaw and alkali-silica reaction, is
   at fault. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which
   probabilities in the model require refinement. Two case studies are
   included in this investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity coefficients for analyzing the interstitial properties

   sensitivity coefficients and estimation of parameters are the main
   objective of this study. Experimentally measured temperature data
   provide an estimate of the phase front locations used as the state

   that the phase front, X, at a given time, t, is a function of
   interstitial properties tau(t) and tau(q) with all other parameters
   remaining constant. The properties tau(l) and tau(q) are the lag-time in
   temperature and heat flux, respectively. The study of the sensitivity
   coefficients using these two parameters is the objective of this study.
   The analysis includes two types of boundary conditions of the first
   kind: prescribed temperature of phase change materials and prescribed
   temperature for solid matrix. These boundary conditions are related to
   the conditions under which the experimental data used in this article
   were collected. The results confirm the existence of the local thermal
   non-equilibrium condition at the onset of a phase change phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{A ferrocenylnaphthalene diimide (FND)-based electrochemical
   hybridization assay (FND-EHA) was applied to the detection of two

   oligodeoxyribonucleotide of 13 bases representing the wild type (WT)
   sequence of LPL was immobilized on a gold electrode, followed by
   hybridization with a sample PCR product of 350 base pairs under
   conditions in which both WT and mutated (MT) sequences could form a
   duplex with the probe. The hybridized electrodes were soaked in an
   electrolyte containing FND under conditions in which only the mismatched
   duplex could undergo dissociation. FND was concentrated in proportion to
   the amount of the duplex remaining on the electrode to,give rise to a

Abstract = {{We introduce a nonlinear regression modeling strategy, using a
   regularized local likelihood method. The local likelihood method is
   effective for analyzing data with complex structure. It might be,
   however, pointed out that the stability of the local likelihood
   estimator is not necessarily guaranteed in the case that the structure
   of system is quite complex. In order to overcome this difficulty, we
   propose a regularized local likelihood method with a polynomial function
   which unites local likelihood and regularization. A crucial issue in
   constructing nonlinear regression models is the choice of a smoothing
   parameter, the degree of polynomial and a regularization parameter. In
   order to evaluate models estimated by the regularized local likelihood
   method, we derive a model selection criterion from an
   information-theoretic point of view. Real data analysis and Monte Carlo
   experiments are conducted to examine the performance of our modeling
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of illicit drugs on paper currency is of interest for
   evidentiary purposes in legal cases involving the drug trade. Current
   methods, primarily based on mass spectrometry, are destructive and
   prevent re-analysis of the evidence. This article details a method based
   on Raman microspectroscopy that is able to collect spectra from
   individual crystals on the surface of paper currency. Mixtures of
   isoxsuprine and norephedrine, which are non-pharmacologically active
   drug surrogates, as well as lidocaine and benzocaine, common excipients
   in street drugs, were doped in small quantities onto US currency.
   Significant fluorescence interference resulted from the underlying
   dollar bill. This work presents two methods for reducing the
   fluorescence background, photobleaching and background subtraction,
   which both worked well. Finally, a method for determining the percent
   composition of individual components in heterogeneous mixtures was
   developed by systematically sampling the surface of the dollar bill.
   Results were accurate within a few percent, although the method was
   quite time consuming.}},

Abstract = {{A flavivirus microarray was developed for detection and identification
   of yellow fever (YF), West Nile, Japanese encephalitis (JE), and the
   dengue 1-4 viruses, which are causing severe human disease all over the
   world. The microarray was based on 500-nucleotide probe fragments from
   five different parts of the seven viral genomes. A low-stringent
   amplification method targeting the corresponding regions of the viral
   genomic RNA was developed and combined with hybridization to the
   microarray for detection and identification. For distinction of the
   generated virus-specific fluorescence-patterns a fitting analysis
   procedure was adapted. The method was verified as functional for all
   seven flaviviruses and the strategy for the amplification, combined with
   the long probes, provided a high tolerance for smaller genetic
   variability, most suitable for these rapidly changing RNA viruses. A
   potentially high detection and identification capacity was proven on
   diverged strains of West Nile and dengue viruses. The lower limit for
   detection was equivalent, or better, when compared to routinely used
   RT-PCR methods. The performance of the method was verified on human
   patient samples containing dengue viruses, or normal human serum spiked
   with YF or JE viruses. The results demonstrated the ability of the
   flavivirus microarray to screen simultaneously a sample for several
   viruses in parallel, in combination with a good lower limit of

Abstract = {{This article charts the changing conceptualization of Travellers in

   basis. It interprets developments in this regard as a movement from
   assimilationism to integrationism to (weak) multiculturalism. The
   article also reveals a significant ``policy implementation deficit{''},
   which is manifested in two ways. Firstly, accommodation output has
   generally failed to meet central government targets and has consistently
   failed to reduce the numbers of Travellers living in unofficial
   encampments. Secondly, the ope of accommodation provided has often been
   at variance with central government recommendations. Thus, an
   assimilationist policy statement has effected multicultural policy
   outcomes, while a multiculturalist Policy statement has effected
   assimilationist policy outcomes. These patterns of accommodation output
   are related to various implementation variables-some long-standing,
   others new-which have impeded the implementation of national policy by
   actors on the ground.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports results on measurements of the density profiles. Here
   we analyse the behaviour of the electron density for a set of
   experiments in type I ELMy H-mode discharges in ASDEX Upgrade where the
   plasma current, plasma density, triangularity and input power were
   varied. Detailed measurements of the radial extent of the perturbation
   on the density profiles caused by the edge localized mode (ELM) crash
   (ELM affected depth), the velocity of the radial propagation of the
   perturbation as well as the width and gradient of the density pedestal
   are determined. The effect of a type I ELM event on the density profiles
   affects the outermost 20-40\% of the plasma minor radius. At the
   scrape-off layer (SOL) the density profile broadens while in the
   pedestal region the density decreases resulting in a smaller density
   gradient. This change in the density profile defines a pivot point
   around which the density profile changes. The average radial velocity at
   the SOL is in the range 125-150 ms(-1) and approximately constant for
   all the density layers far from the pivot point. The width of the
   density pedestal is approximately constant for all the ELMy H-mode
   discharges analysed, with values between 2 and 3.5 cm. These results are
   then compared with an analytical model where the width of the density is
   predominantly set by ionization (neutral penetration model). The width
   of the density profiles for L-mode discharges is included, since L- and
   H-mode have different particle transport. No agreement between the
   experimental results and the model is found.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To determine the association between the existence of a calf
   persistently infected (PI) with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and
   pen morbidity.
   Animals-5,041 calves in 50 pens at a feedlot in Iowa.
   Procedure-In a longitudinal study, ear notches were collected from
   cattle and tested for BVDV antigen. Characteristics of each pen (owner,
   sex, disease rate, number of groups, and source) were recorded. The
   association between the existence of a BVDV-PI calf and morbidity in
   each pen was examined.
   Results-Commingling was associated with an increase in respiratory tract
   disease (odds ratio {[}OR], 3; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 2.5 to
   3.6). Ten BVDV-PI calves (10/5,041 {[}0.2\%]) were identified in 8 of 50
   pens. A BVDV-PI calf was associated with reduced pen-level respiratory
   tract disease (OR, 0.7; 95\% CI, 0.5 to 0.9). Disease prevalence (mean
   +/- SD morbidity, 79 +/- 3.1\%) was lowest in pens containing
   single-source cattle and a BVDV-PI calf (4 pens containing 302 cattle),
   compared with single-source cattle with no BVDV-PI calf (mean morbidity,
   11.89 +/- 9.7\%; 31 pens containing 3,093 cattle), commingled cattle
   with no BVDV-PI calf (mean morbidity, 29.3 16.22\%; 11 pens containing
   1,127 cattle), and commingled cattle with a BVDV-PI calf (mean
   morbidity, 28.6 10.1\%; 4 pens containing 519 cattle).
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Commingling was the greatest risk
   factor associated with morbidity in each pen. A BVDV-PI calf in a pen
   was not associated with increased disease prevalence in commingled
   groups.}},

Abstract = {{Primary objective: To determine test-re-test reliability of the virtual
   planning test (VIP), an executive functioning test of planning and
   organization, in a group of healthy young adults as a pre-cursor to
   determining the appropriateness of using the VIP with individuals with
   traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   Research design: Single-group repeated measures design.
   Methods and procedures: Seventy-five healthy university students were
   administered the VIP and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised
   (HVLT-R) twice, with 6-8 weeks between each subject's two test sessions.
   Main outcomes and results: VIP test-re-test reliability ranged from
   0.194-0.489.
   Conclusions: Knowing how well a healthy young adult performs the first
   time taking the VIP predicts little about how well that adult will
   perform the second time. However, given limitations of other tests of
   planning and organization and potential clinical benefits of the VIP,
   research of the test with individuals with TBI is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The first P-arrival-time data from 513 local earthquakes were analyzed
   to study lateral variation of the depth to the Conrad and Moho
   discontinuities beneath the Chugoku and Shikoku districts, southwest
   Japan, as well as to determine earthquake hypocenters and P-wave station
   corrections. The depth to the discontinuity was estimated by minimizing
   the travel-time residuals of more than 8700 first P arrivals observed at
   55 seismic stations. The Conrad and Moho discontinuities are located
   within depth ranges of 15-25 km and 30-40 km, respectively. The Moho is
   deeper under the mountain area than under the Seto Inland Sea area, and
   especially deep under the Pacific Coast of the Shikoku district and the
   mountain area in the Chugoku district. The depth variation of the Moho
   is quite similar to the Bouguer gravity anomaly distribution and the
   lateral variations of the P-wave velocity. The deep Moho under the
   southern Shikoku is located at the portion in which the continental Moho
   under the island arc meets the oceanic Moho that is the boundary
   interface between the oceanic crust and the Philippine Sea (PHS) plate
   dipping toward the back arc. Although there are high mountains in the
   northern and middle Shikoku, the Moho is not so deep because subduction
   of the PHS plate prevents the Moho from getting deep, while the Moho is
   deep due to isostatic balance under the mountain area in the Chugoku
   district. In addition, we indicated the possibility that the upper
   boundary of the oceanic crust just above the high-velocity PHS plate is
   in contact with the deep Moho under the western Chugoku. The contact of
   the Moho with the oceanic crust can explain the markedly negative
   gravity anomaly observed in the western Chugoku and the later phase that
   appears just after the first P arrival from local earthquakes.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The present study investigated the expression of ICAM-1 and
   VCAM-1 on fibroblasts with interleukin (IL)-4 and/or tumor necrosis
   factor (TNF)-alpha stimulation and assessed the effect of eosinophil
   adhesion on fibroblast viability.
   METHODS. Primary cultured human corneal fibroblasts were incubated with
   IL-4, TNF-alpha, or their combination for 24 hours. Expression of ICAM-1
   and VCAM-1 was examined by real-time quantitative PCR and flow
   cytometric analysis. Purified eosinophils were cocultured with activated
   fibroblasts, and the number of eosinophils adhered to fibroblasts and
   the number of damaged fibroblasts were counted using microscopy. In a
   separate trial, conjunctival and corneal impression cytology was
   performed on patients with atopic keratoconjunctivitis and corneal
   ulcers (eight eyes) to assess the status of the ocular surface
   epithelium and the presence of inflammatory cell infiltrates.
   RESULTS. Real-time quantitative PCR and flow cytometric analysis
   revealed that both mRNA and protein of VCAM- 1 and ICAM-1 were
   upregulated by IL-4 and TNF-alpha. IL-5-primed eosinophils adhered to
   the corneal fibroblasts treated with IL-4 and TNF-alpha, and the
   fibroblasts were damaged by eosinophil adherence. Anti-ICAM-1 antibody
   and anti-VCAM-1 antibody inhibited the eosinophil adherence to
   fibroblasts and the fibroblast damage. Impression cytology revealed
   extensive infiltration of neutrophil and eosinophils among isolated
   ocular surface epithelial cells with advanced squamous metaplasia.
   CONCLUSIONS. Corneal fibroblasts expressed ICAM-1 and VCAM- 1 when
   activated with IL-4 and TNF-alpha. Eosinophils can adhere to the
   activated fibroblasts and can induce subsequent fibroblast damage
   through these adhesion molecules. Eosinophil adhesion to fibroblasts may
   possibly contribute to the pathogenesis of severe persistent allergic
   corneal ulcers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To validate a clinically useful method for measuring acetabular
   cup wear using computed tomography (CT).
   Material and Methods: Eight uncemented acetabular cups were scanned
   twice ex vivo using CT. The linear penetration depth of the femoral
   component head into the cup and the thickness of the remaining
   polyethylene liner were measured in the CT volumes using dedicated
   software. Two independent examiners twice assessed each volume. The CT
   measurements were compared to direct measurements using a coordinate
   measuring device and micrometer measurements.
   Results: Accuracy of wear measurements expressed as penetration depth
   was +/- 0.6 and +/- 1.0 mm for the two examiners, respectively, with no
   significant differences between examiners, trials, and CT scans.
   Accuracy of measurements of remaining polyethylene was +/- 1.3 and +/-
   1.0 mm, respectively, for the two examiners. Systematic differences
   between examiners were found, but no significant differences between
   trials and CT scans. These differences were due to different
   interpretations of metal artifacts in the volumes.
   Conclusion: The proposed CT method for evaluating wear as head
   penetration depth allows for reliable wear detection at a clinically
   relevant level. Measurements of remaining polyethylene on CT volumes are
   not as reliable as wear measurements owing to metal artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{Acutely manic bipolar patients, like patients with schizophrenia,
   Tourette's syndrome, panic disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder,
   exhibit deficits in sensorimotor gating, as measured by prepulse
   inhibition (PPI) of the startle response. Here, we assessed the ability
   of four drugs used in the treatment of bipolar mania-phenytoin,
   carbamazepine, valproate, and lithium-to reduce the PPI-disruptive
   effects of ketamine or amphetamine in the 129SvPaslco inbred strain of
   mice. For comparison, we also assessed the interaction of lithium and
   amphetamine in C57BL/6J mice. This set of studies yielded four major
   results. 1) Lithium chloride (85 mg/kg) prevented amphetamine-induced
   but not ketamine-induced disruption of PPI in both strains of mice. 2)
   Carbamazepine (50 mg/kg) prevented ketamine-induced but not amphetamine-
   induced disruption of PPI. 3) Sodium valproate (100 mg/kg) did not
   prevent amphetamine- or ketamine-induced disruption of PPI. 4) Phenytoin
   (30 mg/ kg) did not prevent amphetamine- or ketamine-induced disruption
   of PPI but increased PPI on its own. These studies did not reveal a
   consistent relationship between the ability of a drug to protect PPI
   from disruption by ketamine or amphetamine and efficacy in the treatment
   of bipolar mania. Instead, the diverse effect profiles of these four
   treatments in reversing the PPI deficits produced by amphetamine or
   ketamine in mice presumably reflect the differences in their respective
   pharmacological mechanisms. Hence, further studies using these
   dopaminergic and glutamatergic models of deficient PPI may provide
   valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the differential
   therapeutic effects of antimanic and mood-stabilizing treatments.}},

Title = {{Perioperative patency of coronary artery bypass grafting is not

Journal = {{ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2132-2140}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. Some concerns have been raised about technical accuracy and
   quality of distal anastomoses in off-pump myocardial revascularization.
   (OPCAB), which could affect graft patency.
   Methods. Transit-time flowmetric results and clinical, enzymatic, and
   echocardiographic findings from 201 consecutive isolated on-pump
   coronary artery bypass graft cases (cardiopulmonary bypass coronary
   artery bypass grafting; group A) were compared with 96 consecutive OPCAB
   (group B) cases performed at our institution between January 2003 and
   December 2004. Maximum, mean, minimum flow, and pulsatility index were
   compared, stratifying the two groups according to graft type and
   coronaries revascularized. Graft flow reserve was evaluated in patients
   undergoing preoperative intraaortic balloon pump during baseline
   conditions and at a 1 to 1 ratio of intraaortic balloon pump
   augmentation.
   Results. No differences were recorded between the two groups in hospital
   mortality, perioperative myocardial infarction, postoperative enzymatic
   leakage, echocardiographic recovery, or hospital stay (p = not
   significant). Off-pump coronary artery bypass and cardiopulmonary bypass
   coronary artery bypass grafting demonstrated similar intraoperative
   maximum (75.8 +/- 10.4 mL/min vs 82.3 +/- 15.8; p = 0.190), mean (50.1
   +/- 13.3 vs 46.3 +/- 7.7; P = 0.420), minimum flow (12.7 +/- 5.3 vs 11.9
   +/- 5.4; p = 0.811), and pulsatility index (2.9 +/- 0.2 vs 2.6 +/- 0.8;
   p = 0.360). After stratifying the population according to graft type, no
   differences were detected between the two groups in transit-time
   flowmetric results of left internal mammary artery, radial artery, and
   single and sequential saphenous vein grafts. A one to one ratio of
   intraaortic balloon pump augmentation did not result in any difference
   in graft flow reserve when left internal mammary artery (p = 0.699),
   radial artery (p = 0.066), and saphenous vein graft anastomoses (p =
   0.772) were considered.
   Conclusions. Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and
   cardiopulmonary bypass coronary artery bypass grafting demonstrated
   similar clinical, biochemical, and transit-time flowmetric results, as
   well as comparable graft flow reserve. These data exclude a lower
   anastomotic quality in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.}},

Abstract = {{ZAP-70 has emerged as a protein of potential prognostic importance in
   chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) following gene expression profiling
   which compared the 2 well established prognostic sub-sets, those with
   unmutated and mutated IgVH genes. This protein tyrosine kinase (PTK),
   known to be of importance in T and NK cell signaling but absent in
   normal peripheral B cells, is expressed in the majority of the poorer
   prognosis unmutated CLL and absent in most cases with mutated IgVH
   genes. ZAP-70 has been shown to be functionally important in the CLL
   cases in which it is expressed; it is also important in B cell
   development in mice and there is preliminary evidence for its expression
   in human B cell progenitors and activated B cells. Whether its
   expression in a sub-set of CLL cases is a result of a more activated
   cell type or a reflection of the stage of maturation of the transforming
   event(s) in CLL is open to debate. ZAP-70 is expressed in a minority of
   other B cell tumors but correlation with IgVH gene mutational status is
   lacking. The problems with ZAP-70 measurement, which has yet to be
   standardized, are reviewed together with its current status as a

Abstract = {{Although disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been a
   well-known disorder for many years, there is lack of sufficient number
   of clinical trials about incidence, frequency of underlying disorders,
   and prognosis of DIC in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate
   the frequency, etiologic factors, and clinical and laboratory findings
   of DIC and to determine the prognostic factors influencing the mortality
   in hospitalized pediatric patients. Medical records of 5535 children who
   were hospitalized were investigated. Sixty-two patients who were
   diagnosed as acute DIC were enrolled. The frequency of DIC was 1.12\%.
   The underlying etiologic factors were infection in 59 patients (95.2\%)
   and major trauma in 3 patients (4.8\%). The frequency of bleeding and
   thrombosis was 48.8 and 4.8\%. Respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic,
   renal, neurologic, and gastrointestinal dysfunction was present in 71,
   67.7, 35.5, 16.1, 16.1 and 11.3\% of patients, respectively. Respiratory
   and cardiovascular dysfunctions were significantly associated with
   mortality. Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome ( MODS) was present in 85.5\%
   of the patients, and 54.8\% of the patients had developed acute
   respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS). Mortality rate was significantly
   high in patients with MODS and ARDS. In multivariete logistic regression
   analysis, only ARDS and cardiovascular dysfunction had predictive and
   prognostic value on mortality. None of the diagnostic laboratory tests
   had predictive or prognostic value and the degree of abnormality of
   these tests did not show any correlation with mortality. In conclusion,
   DIC is not a rare disorder in hospitalized children, especially in
   patients with sepsis, and MODS, ARDS, and respiratory and cardiovascular
   system dysfunctions are poor prognostic factors.}},

Abstract = {{A questionnaire study was conducted to assess the relationship between
   sexual regret and sexual behaviors and demographic factors among 348
   college-aged students prior to attending an educational program about
   sexual health issues. Analyses conducted on the portion of the sample
   who were sexually active (n = 270) indicated that the majority (71.9\%,
   n = 194) has regretted their decision to engage in sexual activity at
   least once. The most cited reasons for regret by students included their
   sexual decision making as inconsistent with their morals (37\%), an
   acknowledgment that alcohol influenced their decision (31.7\%), the
   realization they did not want the same thing as their partner (27.9\%),
   the lack of condom use (25.5\%), feeling pressure by their partner
   (23.0\%), and their desire to wait until marriage to have sex (15.4\%).
   The only significant sex difference was that women reported regret due
   to feeling pressured by a partner more often than men. Multiple and
   logistic regression analyses indicated that the only significant
   predictor of regret regarding one's sexual decisions was the number of
   sexual partners. These results demonstrate the need for sexual educators
   to incorporate sexual regret into their curricula as the phenomenon of
   regret is more common than pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases,
   the usual focus of sexuality education.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated sensory texture profile analysis (STPA) as an
   objective method for characterizing the texture attributes of ``pounded
   yam,{''} a popular dish in West Africa made by peeling yam, boiling,
   pounding and kneading it into a glutinous dough. Panelists were
   carefully selected and trained to assess the texture attributes of
   pounded yam. Standard rating scales were developed from local foods that
   are common in Nigeria, and the foods were used as descriptors to
   exemplify the texture attributes being assessed. Reproducible and
   consistent results were obtained. It is thus concluded that STPA can be
   used as an objective method for evaluating the texture attributes of
   pounded yam.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To describe the epidemiology, clinical features and outcome
   of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children presenting to a tertiary
   children's hospital.
   Methods: Sixty-three month retrospective review of serologically
   diagnosed M. pneumoniae infections.
   Results: There were 76 children, 42 boys and 34 girls, mean age 6.3 +/-
   3.5 years. The age group most commonly affected was 5-9 years, followed
   by children 1-5 years. More than half of the patients had failed to
   respond to antibiotics before referral. The commonest presentation was
   with cough and fever. Coryza, diarrhoea, vomiting, tachypnoea and
   recession were significantly more common in children less than 5 years
   than in children 5-15 years. Hospitalized patients were more likely than
   non-hospitalized patients to have respiratory distress with recession
   and wheeze. Radiographic findings were non-specific. Thrombocytosis was
   found in 29 (41.4\%) of 70 children studied.
   Conclusion: The clinical features of M. pneumoniae infection were
   different in children less than 5 years than in children aged 5-9 years.
   The presence of thrombocytosis in 40\% of the cases has not previously
   been reported in children.}},

Abstract = {{A poly(phenylacetylene) bearing a polycarbohydrate ionophore as a graft
   chain (copolymer 4) was synthesized by the copolymerization of
   end-functionalized (1 -> 6)-2,5-anhydro-3,4-di-O-ethyl-D-glucitol with a
   4-ethynylbenzoyl group (macromonomer 2) with phenylacetylene. Copolymer
   4 showed a split-type circular dichroism (CD) in the long absorption
   region of the conjugated polymer backbone (280-500 nm), and the CD
   pattern varied in response to external stimuli, such as the solvents and
   temperature. This suggested that 4 had a predominantly one-handed
   helical conformation in the polyacetylene backbone. The CD pattern of 4
   was completely inverted by the formation of a complex between the
   macromolecular ionophore units and the selected metal cations, that is,
   Ba2+, Pb2+, Sr2+, Na+, and Li+. This suggested that copolymer 4
   underwent a helix-helix transition through the host-guest complexation
   with achiral inorganic metal cations. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane ( DDT) exposure is
   known to affect human endocrine function, few previous studies have
   investigated the effects of DDT exposure on age at menarche or menstrual
   cycle length.
   Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted to study the effects of
   DDT exposure on age at menarche and menstrual cycle length among 466
   newly married, nulliparous female Chinese textile workers aged 20 - 34
   years enrolled between 1996 and 1998. Serum was analysed for DDT and its
   major metabolites. Multivariate linear regression was used to estimate
   DDT exposure effects on age at menarche and multivariate logistic
   regression was used to estimate DDT exposure effects on odds of
   experiencing short or long cycles.
   Results: Relative to those in the lowest DDT quartile, the adjusted mean
   age at menarche was younger in those in the fourth quartile ( -1.11
   years). Modeled as a continuous variable, a 10 ng/g increase in serum
   DDT concentration was associated with an adjusted reduction in age at
   menarche of 0.20 years. Relative to those in the lowest DDT quartile,
   odds of any short cycle (< 21 days) in the previous year were higher for
   those in the fourth quartile ( odds ratio = 2.78; 95\% CI 1.07 to 7.14).
   There were no associations between serum DDT concentrations and odds of
   experiencing a long cycle (> 40 days).
   Conclusion: Results suggest that DDT exposure was associated with
   earlier age at menarche and increased risk of experiencing a shortened
   menstrual cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Auxin regulates various aspects of plant growth and development. The
   AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) genes encode short-lived
   transcriptional repressors that are targeted by the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR
   RESPONSE1/AUXIN RECEPTOR F-BOX proteins. The Aux/IAA proteins regulate
   auxin-mediated gene expression by interacting with members of the AUXIN
   RESPONSE FACTOR protein family. Aux/IAA function is poorly understood;
   herein, we report the identification and characterization of insertion
   mutants in 12 of the 29 Aux/IAA family members. The mutants show no
   visible developmental defects compared with the wild type. Double or
   triple mutants of closely related Aux/IAA genes, such as iaa8-1 iaa9-1
   or iaa5-1 iaa6-1 iaa19-1, also exhibit wild-type phenotypes. Global gene
   expression analysis reveals that the molecular phenotypes of
   auxin-treated and untreated light-grown seedlings are unaffected in the
   iaa17-6 and iaa5-1 iaa6-1 iaa19-1 mutants. By contrast, similar analysis
   with the gain-of-function axr3-1/iaa17-1 mutant seedlings reveals
   dramatic changes in basal and auxin-induced gene expression compared
   with the wild type. Expression of several type-A ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE
   REGULATOR genes and a number of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis
   and degradation is repressed in axr3-1/iaa17-1. The data suggest
   extensive functional redundancy among Aux/IAA gene family members and
   that enhanced stability of the AXR3/IAA17 protein severely alters the
   molecular phenotype, resulting in developmental defects.}},

   previously received two doses of the measles vaccine. Median values for
   measles-specific interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4)
   cytokines were 40.7 pg/ml {[}interquartile range (IQR) 8.1-176.7] and
   9.7 pg/ml (IQR 2.8-24.3), respectively. Class I HLA-A ({*}0101 and

   associated with measles-virus-induced IFN-gamma secretion. HLA-A{*}3101
   and Cw{*}0303 were associated with a higher median IFN-gamma response,

   vaccination, indicating that HLA class I molecules may have a limited
   effect on measles-vaccine-induced IL-4 secretion. Understanding the
   genetic factors that influence variations in cytokine secretion
   following measles vaccination will provide insight into the factors that

Abstract = {{Seeds originating from some Turkish sources were analyzed with respect
   to their characteristics and FA compositions. These seeds represented
   pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.),
   pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.), catalpa (Catalpa bignonoides),
   bourdaine (Rhamnus frangula L.), Oregon grape (Mahonia aquifolium),
   sarsaparilla (Smilax aspera), mahaleb (Prunus mahaleb L.), blackthorn
   (Prunus spinosa L.), cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus L.), and
   firethorn (Pyracantha coccinea). Bitter gourd and bourdaine seeds
   contain more than 20\% oil. Catalpa, bourdaine, Oregon grape,
   blackthorn, and cherry laurel seed oil contents ranged from 15 to 20\%.
   In the seeds from plants belonging to the Rosacea family, oil content
   ranged from 4.5 to 18.5\%. Among the seed oils analyzed, pot marigold
   had one of the lowest oil contents (5.9\%). Pomegranate contained the
   highest amount of total conjugated linolenic acid (CLNA) (86.0\%). Seed
   oils of bitter gourd, pot marigold, mahaleb, and catalpa were rich in
   CLNA: 60.0, 29.5, 27.6, and 27.5\%, respectively. Bourdaine, Oregon
   grape, and sarsaparilla seeds contained low amounts of CLNA. On the
   other hand, mahaleb, bourdaine, catalpa, Oregon grape, sarsaparilla,
   cherry laurel, blackthorn, and firethorn seed oils are basically oleic
   and linoleic acid-rich oils and therefore have little drying ability
   (semidrying oil). The results show a potential for the use of endogenous
   Turkish seeds as a source of CLNA.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and case-control studies were conducted
   to describe the epidemiology of Campylobacter in chickens, swine, dairy
   cows, farm workers, nonfarm residents, and children with diarrhea.
   Samples were collected in Chiang Mai and Lamphung provinces of northern
   Thailand from 2000 through 2003. A total of 2,360 samples were
   processed. Results from the cross-sectional study indicated that the
   prevalences of Campylobacter in chickens at the farm, slaughterhouse,
   and market were 64, 38, and 47\%, respectively. In swine, the
   prevalences at the farm, slaughterhouse, and market were 73, 69, and
   23\%, respectively. Campylobacter prevalence was 14\% in dairy cows and
   5\% in raw milk. The prevalence of Campylobacter on farms was lower in
   environmental samples than in samples collected from live animals. No
   Campylobacter isolates were obtained from healthy nonfarm residents, but
   isolates were obtained from 5 and 18\% of farm workers and children with
   diarrhea, respectively. The prevalence of Campylobacter in pigs in the
   longitudinal study was 61\% at the farm, 46\% at the slaughterhouse, and
   33\% at the market. The majority of Campylobacter isolates from chickens
   (52\%), swine (98\%), and farm workers (66\%) were Campylobacter coli,
   whereas the majority of isolates from dairy cows (63\%) and children
   with diarrhea (62\%) were Campylobacter jejuni. Most Campylobacter
   isolates from diarrheal children had single-strand conformation
   polymorphism profiles similar to those of isolates from chickens. None
   of the risk factors for infection in children with diarrhea, were
   significantly associated with the isolation of Campylobacter.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes is classified clinically into two types: type 1 and type 2
   diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune diabetes, whereas, in
   contrast, type 2 diabetes is nonautoimmune. However, there is a group of
   phenotypic adult type 2 diabetic patients (similar to 10\%) who have
   islet autoantibodies similar to type 1 diabetes. These patients are said
   to have latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or type 1.5
   diabetes. T-cells reacting with islet proteins have been demonstrated in
   type 1 and type 1.5 diabetic patients. In contrast, classic
   autoantibody-negative type 2 diabetic patients are also negative for
   T-cell responses to islet proteins. Therefore, we questioned whether
   type 1 and type 1.5 diabetes are similar or different autoimmune
   diseases. We have investigated the immunological and metabolic
   differences between type 1, type 1.5, and classic type 2 diabetic
   patients. We have identified autoantibody differences, differences in
   islet proteins recognized by T-cells, and differences in insulin
   resistance. We have also identified a small group of patients who have
   T-cells responsive to islet proteins but who are autoantibody negative.
   These patients appear to be similar to type 1.5 patients in having
   decreased stimulated C-peptide values. These immunological differences
   between type I and type 1.5 diabetes suggest at least partially distinct
   disease processes.}},

   Lead compounds displayed single digit nanomolar inhibition in vitro (of
   rabbit osteoclast-mediated degradation of bovine bone). The best
   compound in this series, 39n (CRA-013783/ L-006235), was orally
   bioavailable in rats, with a terminal half-life of over 3 h. 39n was
   dosed orally in ovariectomized rhesus monkeys once per day for 7 days.
   Collagen breakdown products were reduced by up to 76\% dose-dependently.
   Plasma concentrations of 39n above the bone resorption IC50 after 24 h
   indicated a correlation between functional cellular and in vivo assays.
   Inhibition of collagen breakdown by cathepsin K inhibitors suggests this
   mechanism of action may be useful in osteoporosis and other indications

Abstract = {{The blood concentration of agouti-related protein ( AgRP), a protein
   related to hyperphagia and obesity, is increased in obese human and
   fasted lean subjects. Because there is no saturable transport system at
   the blood-brain barrier for circulating AgRP to reach its central
   nervous system target, uptake of AgRP by peripheral organs might be
   physiologically meaningful. Using the biologically active fragment
   AgRP(82-131), we determined the pharmacokinetics of its radioactively
   labeled tracer after iv bolus injection and compared it with that of the
   vascular marker albumin. AgRP enters peripheral organs at different
   influx rates, all of which were higher than into brain and spinal cord.
   At 10 min after iv injection, the radioactivity recovered in the liver,
   which had the fastest influx rate for AgRP, represented intact
   I-125-AgRP. The adrenal gland had a moderately fast uptake ( but the
   highest initial volume of distribution), followed by the heart, lungs,
   and skeletal muscle. By comparison, epididymal fat, testis, and pancreas
   had low permeability to AgRP. Saturation of influx was determined by
   coadministration of excess unlabeled AgRP and was shown to be present in
   the liver and adrenal gland. The influx rate and initial volume of
   distribution did not show a linear correlation with vascular
   permeability or regional blood flow. AgRP uptake by the liver and
   epididymal fat was significantly increased by overnight fasting, whereas
   that by the adrenal gland was significantly decreased in fasted mice.
   Thus, the differential uptake of AgRP by peripheral organs could be a
   regulated process that is modulated by food deprivation.}},

Abstract = {{MRI imaging has significantly improved the detection of brain lesions
   over the past few decades. It has high sensitivity to intracranial
   pathology but confident preoperative tissue diagnosis is relatively
   unusual. MR spectroscopy provides in-vivo biochemical information and
   has been used to improve the low specificity of tumour diagnosis. During
   the last decade there have been a number of reports making the case that
   proton spectroscopy can distinguish different grades of glial tumours
   and in some situations provide information on histological type. We
   report four children who presented with neurological symptoms and focal
   masses on MRI. MRS in each of them gave results consistent with textbook
   descriptions of malignancy, but in all four cases the abnormalities were
   subsequently shown to be due to demyelination. We reiterate that
   spectroscopic appearances are nonspecific and spectroscopic data should
   be evaluated in the light of concurrent imaging features and the
   clinical presentation.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship

   timing of clinical improvement to fluoxetine in major depressive
   disorder (MDD) patients. A total of 110 outpatients with MDD who
   responded to an 8-wk trial of fluoxetine had serum folate, B12, and
   homocysteine measurements at baseline (prior to fluoxetine initiation).
   Onset of clinical improvement was defined as a 30\% decrease in Hamilton
   Depression Scale scores that led to a 50\% decrease by week S. Patients
   with low folate levels (<= 2.5 ng/ml) were more likely to experience a
   later onset of clinical improvement than eufolatemic patients
   (p=0.0028). B12 and homocysteine level status did not predict time to
   clinical improvement (p > 0.05). In conclusion, low serum folate levels
   were found to be associated with a delayed onset of clinical improvement
   during treatment with fluoxetine in MDD by, on average, 1.5 wk.}},

Abstract = {{A common mitochondrial (mt) DNA variant that is maternally inherited,
   the 16189 variant, is associated with type 2 diabetes and thinness at
   birth. To elucidate the association of the variant with thinness, we
   studied the 16189 variant in a well-characterized Australian cohort (n =
   161) who were followed up from birth to age 20 yr. PCR analysis and
   mtDNA haplotyping was carried out on DNA from 161 offspring from
   consecutive, normal, singleton pregnancies followed from birth to age 20
   yr. The 16189 mtDNA variant was present in 14 of the 161 20 yr olds
   (8.7\%). Both the mothers with the 16189 variant and their 20-yr-old
   offspring were thinner than those without. Median (interquartile range)
   BMI was 21.9 kg/m(2) (20.4 to 22.9) in mothers with the variant compared
   with 23.5 (21.4 to 26.6) in those without (P = 0.013) and 22.2 (21.1 to
   23.8) in 20 yr olds with the variant compared with 22.7 (20.8 to 25.6)
   in those without (P = 0.019). The 16189 variant was also associated with
   a high placental weight and high placental-to-birth weight ratio (P =
   0.051 and P = 0.0024, respectively). Insulin sensitivity was normal in
   20 yr olds with the 16189 variant. This contrasts with 20 yr olds who
   did not have the variant but who had been thin or small at birth and who
   had normal BMI and normal placental-to-birth weight ratio, but were
   insulin resistant. This study suggests that the 16189 mtDNA variant is
   associated with maternally inherited thinness in young adults. This may
   be mediated by effects on mtDNA replication and, thence, placental
   function. Further research is required to confirm these hypotheses.}},

Title = {{`Go for it'! Towards a critical realist approach to voluntary

Journal = {{HEALTH RISK \& SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines a type of voluntary risk-taking, orientation to risk
   and risk rhetoric, which we call `go(ing) for it.' Although occasionally
   acknowledged in the field of clinical risk management, going for it
   receives little or no consideration in the existing sociological
   approaches to risk analysis. We offer a primarily theoretical discussion
   rather than a formal research report. We illustrate it with empirical
   examples derived from recent personal experiences and some of our own
   fieldwork data, together with other academic studies.
   The paper makes two central points. First, because risk analysis has
   been dominated to date by the problematic of identifying dangers and
   blame-shedding, it has lacked a model of the risk-taking agent
   appropriate to understanding the voluntary embracing of risk embodied in
   going for it. However, this type of risk-taking cannot be marginalized
   by an approach based on the critical realist account of human agency
   which shows it to be a necessary entailment of actors' commitments and
   priorities emergent from their necessary relations with the three orders
   of nature, practice and society. (Technical risk assessment, risk
   society theory and cultural bias theory lack this understanding of
   risk-taking.) The second main point is that presenting oneself as
   risk-taking is a moral rhetoric, given the association between voluntary
   risk and commitment. We argue this rhetoric mobilizes a kind of
   postmodern sublime sympathy of great importance as an interactional
   technique for generating social solidarities and the pervasive sense of
   living in a `risk society.' Living with the contemporary representations
   of risk sustains an emotional `feeling tone' of shared predicaments. The
   discourse of `plunging' expressed in emphatic instructions like `go for
   it' and `just do it' are analysed for what it offers to make risk-taking
   accountable.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Although widely used in epidemiological studies, self-report
   has been shown to underestimate the prevalence of smoking among pregnant
   women. Objectives of this study were to examine the discrepancy between
   self-reported and cotinine-validated smoking status, and the
   sociodemographic characteristics associated with the misclassification
   of real smoking status among pregnant women in Tallinn, the capital of
   Estonia. Methods: Serum cotinine assays were performed on a subsample (n
   = 1360) of the pregnant women, who had participated in a recent study of
   human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) seroprevalence in Estonia. In the
   present study, serum concentrations >= 15 ng/ml were used to distinguish
   current smokers from nonsmokers. The serum-validated smoking level was
   compared with the self-reported level in the records of the Estonian
   Medical Birth Registry. For the group of self-reported non-smokers, the
   differences between the cotinine-validated smokers and the
   cotinine-validated nonsmokers, with respect to their sociodemographic
   characteristics (age, ethnicity, educational level, employment status,
   marital status, parity), were estimated by logistic regression. Results:
   Of 1239 women who reported being nonsmokers, 259 (20.9\%) had serum
   cotinine levels >= 15 ng/ml, and can be regarded as current smokers.
   Among self-reported nonsmokers, nondisclosure of current smoking was
   significantly more frequent in non-Estonian, less educated, socially
   inactive, cohabiting and multiparous women. Conclusions: Self-reported
   data on smoking in pregnant women underestimates the real smoking
   prevalence in Estonia. Maternal unwillingness to declare smoking during
   pregnancy needs to be taken into account in the practice of maternal and
   child health to better target prenatal smoking cessation interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Rotavirus is the main cause of acute diarrhea in infants and young
   children worldwide. In Paraguay, acute diarrhea ranks fourth among the
   causes of mortality in children under 4 years of age. Rotavirus was
   detected in 93 out of 410 patients admitted to three main hospitals in
   Asuncion, Paraguay from August 1998 to August 2000. Samples from 64
   patients were analyzed by RT-PCR for G and P typing. G4P{[}8] (46.9\%;
   30/64) was the most common strain detected, followed by G9P{[}8](17.2\%;
   11/64) and G1P{[}8](10,9\%; 7/64). Since G4 was predominant during the
   epidemiological peaks of 1998 and 1999, four samples were sequenced and
   all grouped into sublineage Ic. This sublineage was reported for the
   first time in 1998 in Argentina, southern border of Paraguay, and it was
   shown to be responsible for the increased prevalence of G4 during the
   epidemiological season of 1998 in that country. In addition, Paraguayan
   G1 strains grouped in different lineages (I and II). However, G9 was

Abstract = {{Objective: Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)
   currently requires experiences in administration for psychiatry
   residents. In response to this challenge, the authors created a peer
   review workshop.
   Methods: The authors report on the design, implementation, and outcome
   of the peer review workshop for PGY-3 and PGY-4 psychiatry residents.
   Results: Comparison of pre and post results of a 10-question test given
   to the resident group showed a statistically significant improvement.
   Moreover, it was noticed that the discussion among the residents rose to
   a new level of appreciation of administrative techniques and skills. The
   residents rated the workshop very favorably and unanimously recommended
   that the workshop be repeated on a yearly basis at the beginning of the
   academic year with the previous year's PGY-3s serving as mentors at each
   clinical site.
   Conclusion: The workshop process described has potential practical
   application for other psychiatry residency programs that are also
   attempting to respond to these ACGME challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, DNA microarray-based gene expression profiles have been used
   to correlate the clinical behavior of cancers with the differential gene
   expression levels in cancerous and normal tissues. To this end, after
   selection of some predictive genes based on signal-to-noise (S2N) ratio,
   unsupervised learning like clustering and supervised learning like
   k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier are widely used. Instead of S2N
   ratio, adaptive searches like Probabilistic Model Building Genetic
   Algorithm (PMBGA) can be applied for selection of a smaller size gene
   subset that would classify patient samples more accurately. In this
   paper, we propose a new PMBGA-based method for identification of
   informative genes from microarray data. By applying our proposed method
   to classification of three microarray data sets of binary and multi-type
   tumors, we demonstrate that the gene subsets selected with our technique
   yield better classification accuracy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In the deep subsurface of the northeast German basin products of
   extensive volcanism are present that formed during the waning phase of
   the Variscan orogeny (Permian-Carboniferous boundary). Large volumes (>=
   48,000 km(3)) of dominantly felsic magma were emplaced in the northern
   foreland of the Variscan mountains in a terrestrial semi-arid
   environment. Most of these units were inferred by previous authors to
   represent the products of explosive volcanic eruptions such as
   ignimbrites. However, a detailed analysis of the volcanic texture and
   lithofacies association shows that most units are best interpreted as
   coherent lavas emplaced either as extrusive units or as shallow
   intrusions, with important implications for the reconstruction of the
   paleo-environment. This study shows that detailed textural examination
   of drill cores provide important observations, which can be applied as
   criteria for the interpretation of the mode of volcanic eruptions.
   Furthermore, phenocryst logging and geochemical fingerprinting based on
   immobile element ratios can be employed for the classification and
   discrimination of individual emplacement units.}},

Abstract = {{Radiocarbon analyses of bulk carbon and individual organic compounds are
   presented for the hydrothermal environment of the Rebecca's Roost vent
   in the southern trough of the Guaymas Basin hydrothermal field. The
   Delta C-14 values of CO, and CH4 in the hottest hydrothermal fluids (317
   degrees C) are nearly ``radiocarbon dead{''} (-944 parts per thousand
   and -923 parts per thousand, respectively). In contrast, the Delta C-14
   values of sediments and individual fatty acids (-418 parts per thousand
   to -227 parts per thousand) obtained from a bacterial mat located south
   of the vent site are similar to values previously reported for
   hydrothermal petroleum in this environment and are more depleted in C-14
   than overlying waters. Hydrothermal fluids moving through the sediments
   appear to supply C-14 of intermediate age to the bacteria. This carbon
   may take the form of, or may be supplied by processes similar to, the
   generation of hydrothermal petroleum. Although the bacterial mat visibly
   was dominated by Beggiatoa spp., such mats are known to include numerous
   other species. Individual compound data show that preaged carbon is
   being consumed by the integrated bacterial assemblage. Values of delta
   C-13 and Delta C-14 indicate that petroleum-derived carbon is
   incorporated directly into fresh bacterial biomass. Subsequently, some
   of this newly synthesized material also is consumed by heterotrophs, as
   eukaryotic sterols from the same sample also have C-14-depleted values
   (Delta C-14 = -136 parts per thousand to -110 parts per thousand).
   Therefore, the entire system may operate as a complex consortium to
   transform relict carbon back into biomass. Bacterial consumption of
   relict carbon occurs despite the ample supply of fresh carbon delivered
   from the productive, overlying water column. Copyright (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Glycogen is an important component of whole-body glucose metabolism;
   MGSKO mice lack skeletal muscle glycogen due to disruption of the GYS1
   gene, which encodes muscle glycogen synthase. MGSKO mice were 5-10\%
   smaller than wild-type littermates with less body fat. They have more
   oxidative muscle fibers and, based on the activation state of
   AMP-activated protein kinase, more capacity to oxidize fatty acids.
   Blood glucose in fed and fasted MGSKO mice was comparable to wild-type
   littermates. Serum insulin was lower in fed but not in fasted MGSKO
   animals. In a glucose tolerance test, MGSKO mice disposed of glucose
   more effectively than wild-type animals and had a more sustained
   elevation of serum insulin. This result was not explained by increased
   conversion to serum lactate or by enhanced storage of glucose in the
   liver. However, glucose infusion rate in a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic
   clamp was normal in MGSKO mice despite diminished muscle glucose uptake.
   During the clamp, MGSKO animals accumulated significantly higher levels
   of liver glycogen as compared with wild-type littermates. Although
   disruption of the GYS1 gene negatively affects muscle glucose uptake,
   overall glucose tolerance is actually improved, possibly because of a
   role for GYS1 in tissues other than muscle.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The factors that induce te formation of noncarious lesions
   are not understood fully, particularly those that are related to
   occlusal aspects. The authors conducted a study to evaluate the
   prevalence of noncarious cervical lesions in adults and their
   association with occlusal aspects.
   Methods. The authors examined 70 people (35 men and 35 women) aged 25 to
   45 to determine the presence and type of noncarious cervical lesions,
   wear facets, tooth contacts in minimal intercuspal position, and lateral
   and protrusive movements. The assessment involved a questionnaire and
   clinical examinations.
   Results. Among the teeth the authors evaluated, 17.23 percent had
   cervical lesions, 80.28 percent of which had wear facets (P < .01). The
   authors found a significant difference between the prevalence of
   noncarious lesions and the presence of wear facets (P = .0484)
   Conclusions: The authors found that cervical lesion were related
   significantly to wear facets. These findings strenghten evidence for the
   role of occlusal forces as an etiologic factor for noncarious lesions.
   Clinical Implications. The presence of wear facets should be considered
   in the treatment of noncarious cervical lesions.}},

Abstract = {{In mammals and yeasts, arginine methylation, catalyzed by protein
   arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), has been implicated in regulation
   of diverse processes such as protein-protein interaction, protein
   localization, signal transduction, RNA processing, and transcription. A
   large number of PRMT substrates are RNA binding proteins. In
   trypanosomes, gene regulation is controlled primarily at the levels of
   RNA processing, stability, and translation, and likely involves numerous
   RNA binding proteins. Thus, arginine methylation may be especially
   important in controlling gene expression in this evolutionarily ancient
   group of organisms. To begin to understand the role of arginine
   methylation in trypanosomes, we identified and characterized a type I
   PRMT from Trypanosoma brucei, termed TbPRMT1. TbPRMT1 displays 51\%
   amino acid identity to human PRMT1 It possesses an S-adenosylmethionine
   binding site and double E and THW loops, common and absolute features
   associated with other PRMTs. Recombinant TbPRMT1 methylates both an
   artificial RG-rich peptide and the T brucei mitochondrial RNA binding
   protein, TBRGG1, and it exhibits differences in substrate specificity
   compared to rat PRMT1. TbPRMT1 is constitutively expressed during the T.
   brucei life cycle. Disruption of TbPRMT1 gene expression by RNA
   interference did not result in a significant growth defect in procyclic
   form T. brucei. Finally, we observe a dramatic decrease in the cellular
   level of asymmetric dimethylarginine upon TbPRMT1 knock down, indicating
   that TbPRMT1 is the predominant type I PRMT in T brucei. The strong
   conservation of PRMT1 homologs between protozoa and humans highlights
   the importance of arginine methylation as a regulatory mechanism in
   eukaryotes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a bibliographical synthesis of the artistic
   manifestation of Orientalism in the 19(th) century. Thirty years ago, on
   the occasion of the exhibition in Marseilles, L'Orient en Question, we
   speculated on the relevance of a theme which might have seemed to have
   grown stale. Actually with time, its solidity and legitimacy have
   unceasingly increased. After the period of taking stock, with its
   multitude of exhibitions and monographs, which gradually restituted the
   opulence of the body of work, often undreamed of beyond a few great
   names, new issues have suddenly appeared. The precise study of voyages
   was developed, in parallel with that of the literary domain,
   emphasizing, for example, the interest of ``intertextuality{''} than can
   have its equivalent in painting. The ``two exoticisms 11 noted by
   Gautier, in time and in space, were enhanced by various studies. Since
   1978, the ``key-stone{''} book by Edward Said, Orientalism has imposed
   interpretive thinking. For or against the thesis of a Western
   imperialism, which according to the author, ``created{''} the Orient,
   art history has taken into account an interpretation which has made its
   mark. This is perhaps not foreign to the current dialogue between
   ``Orient{''} and ``Occident{''}, concerning the reception of Islamic
   art, or on the perception of Orientalism in the countries which served
   as its models.}},

Abstract = {{Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, a chronic
   illness characterized by progressive cardiomyopathy and/or denervation
   of the digestive tract. The parasite surface is covered with
   glycoconjugates, such as mucin-type glycoproteins and
   glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPLs), whose glycans are rich in
   galactopyranose (Galp) and/or galactofuranose (Galf) residues. These
   molecules have been implicated in attachment of the parasite to and
   invasion of mammalian cells and in modulation of the host immune
   responses during infection. In T. cruzi, galactose (Gal) biosynthesis
   depends on the conversion of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose (UDP-Glc)
   into UDP-Gal by an NAD-dependent reduction catalyzed by UDP-Gal
   4-epimerase. Phosphoglucomutase (PGM) is a key enzyme in this metabolic
   pathway catalyzing the interconversion of Glc-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) and
   Glc-1-P which is then converted into UDP-Glc. We here report the cloning
   of T. cruzi PGM, encoding T. cruzi PGM, and the heterologous expression
   of a functional enzyme in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. T. cruzi PGM is a
   single copy gene encoding a predicted protein sharing 61\% amino acid
   identity with Leishmania major PGM and 43\% with the yeast enzyme. The
   59-trans-splicing site of PGM RNA was mapped to a region located at 18
   base pairs upstream of the start codon. Expression of T. cruzi PGM in a
   S. cerevisiae null mutant-lacking genes encoding both isoforms of PGM
   (pgm1 nu/pgm2 nu) rescued the lethal phenotype induced upon cell growth
   on Gal as sole carbon source.}},

Abstract = {{Genomics and proteomics approaches generate distinct gene expression and
   protein profiles, listing individual genes embedded in broad functional
   terms as gene ontologies. However, interpretation of gene profiles in a
   regulatory and functional context remains a major issue. Elucidation of
   regulatory mechanisms at the gene expression level via analysis of
   promoter regions is a prominent procedure to decipher such-gene
   regulatory networks.
   We propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) to extract joint promoter
   modules in a set of coexpressed genes as resulting from differential
   gene expression experiments. Algorithm design has focused on the
   following constraints: (I) identification of the major promoter modules,
   which are (II) characterized by a maximum number of joint motifs and
   (III) are found in a maximum number of coexpressed genes.
   The capability of the GA in detecting multiple modules was evaluated on
   various test data sets, analyzing the impact of the number of motifs per
   promoter module, the number of genes associated with a module, as well
   as the total number of distinct promoter modules encoded in a sequence
   set.
   In addition to the test data sets, the GA was evaluated on two
   biological examples, namely a muscle-specific data set and the upstream
   sequences of the beta-actin gene (ACTB) derived from different species,
   complemented by a comparison to alternative promoter module
   identification routines. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Spores of Bacillus anthracis Sterne strain were recovered from 100 ml
   and 1 L volumes of tap and source waters using filtration through a 0.45
   um filter, followed by overnight culture on agar plates. In a set of
   experiments comparing sheep red blood cell (SRBC) plates with a
   chromogenic agar formulation designed by R \& F Laboratories, with a
   spiking dose of 47 plate-enumerated spores in 100 ml tap water, the mean
   spore recoveries were 34.0 and 30.8 spores, respectively. When a spiking
   dose of 100 fluorescence activated cell sorter(FACS)-enumerated spores
   was used in 100 ml potable water, the average recovery with SRBC plates
   was 48 spores. Detection efforts with spiking doses of 35 and 10 spores
   in I L tap water were successful, but recovery efforts from spiked 1 L
   volumes of source water were problematic due to the concomitant growth
   of normal spore-forming flora. Recoveries were also attempted on 10 L
   volumes of tap water. For a spiking dose of 100 spores, mean recovery
   from six replicates was 11 spores (+/- 6.8, range 2-20), and for a
   spiking dose of 10 spores, mean recovery from six replicates was 2.3
   spores (+/- 3.5, range 0-9). Efforts were also made to `' direct detect
   `' spores via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on washes from filters.
   When spiking 534 spores in 100 ml 9/9 replicates of spiked tap water,
   6/6 source water replicates, and 0/3 unspiked controls were positive by
   lef PCR. When 534 spores were spiked into 1 L tap water, the lef PCR was
   unsuccessful; however, using the nested vrrA PCR resulted in 4/9 spiked
   samples, and 0/3 unspiked controls, testing positive. Our results
   indicate that an inexpensive and userfriendly method, utilizing
   filtration apparatus commonly present in many water quality testing
   labs, can readily be adapted for use in detecting this potential threat
   agent. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   investigate timing and emotional valence of experienced normative and
   silent transitions of middle-aged persons, and (b) to discover the
   impact of past transitions on current well-being and on anticipation of
   old age. Analysis of interview data from 268 persons suggest a
   considerable stability in the basic structure of human biography, but
   also evidence for age group, gender, and personality differences in the
   subjective perception of the life-course, adjustment and future
   anticipation in middle age. Emotional valence of puberty and that of

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3985-3996}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Integral membrane proteins are characterized by having a preference for
   aromatic residues, e. g., tryptophan ( W), at the interface between the
   lipid bilayer core and the aqueous phase. The reason for this is not
   clear, but it seems that the preference is related to a complex
   interplay between steric and electrostatic forces. The flat rigid
   paddle-like structure of tryptophan, associated with a quadrupolar
   moment (aromaticity) arising from the pi-electron cloud of the indole,
   interacts primarily with moieties in the lipid headgroup region hardly
   penetrating into the bilayer core. We have studied the interaction
   between the nitrogen moiety of lipid molecule headgroups and the
   pi-electron distribution of gramicidin (gA) tryptophan residues (W-9,
   W-11, W-13, and W-15) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of gA
   embedded in two hydrated lipid bilayers composed of
   1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) and 1-palmitoyl-2-
   leoylphosphatidyl-choline (POPC), respectively. We use a force field
   model for tryptophan in which polarizability is only implicit, but we
   believe that classical molecular dynamics force fields are sufficient to
   capture the most prominent features of the cation- p interaction. Our
   criteria for cation-pi interactions are based on distance and angular
   requirements, and the results from our model suggest that cation- p
   interactions are relevant for W-PE(11), W-PE(13), W-PE(15), and, to some
   extent, W-PC(11) and W-PC(13). In our model, W 9 does not seem to engage
   in cation- p interactions with lipids, neither in POPE nor POPC. The
   criteria for the cation-pi effect are satisfied more often in POPE than
   in POPC, whereas the H-bonding ability between the indole donor and the
   carbonyl acceptor is similar in POPE and POPC. This suggests an
   increased affinity for lipids with ethanolamine headgroups to
   transmembrane proteins enriched in interfacial tryptophans.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Temporal arteritis (TA) affects large arteries, including the
   vertebral arteries in up to 15\% of cases. High resolution
   ultrasonography (US) is widely used for noninvasive imaging of the
   extracranial vertebral arteries. We assessed the prevalence of
   vertebrobasilar ischemia and structural abnormalities of the
   extracranial vertebral arteries by US in patients with TA and
   polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and in healthy controls.
   Methods. This prospective study included clinical and US data from 93
   patients with TA and 34 with PMR. A comparison was made with US findings
   in a population based, age matched group of 203 elderly subjects.
   Results. Vertebrobasilar ischemia in 4 patients with TA was less
   frequent (4.3\%) than neuroophthal-mological complications (27.9\%). In
   all 4 patients vertebrobasilar ischemia was associated with proximal
   vertebral artery occlusive disease. The rate of stenosis (> 50\%) and
   occlusions of the vertebral arteries was significantly higher in the TA
   patients (12.9\%) than in the PMR patients (2.9\%) and controls (3\%).
   Concentric hypoechogenic mural thickening of the proximal segments V0/V1
   of the vertebral artery was found in only one PMR patient and 2 TA
   patients.
   Conclusion. Vertebrobasilar ischemia is an uncommon complication of TA.
   Color duplex sonography can help to detect temporal arteritis of the
   vertebral arteries. Hypoechogenic mural thickening in TA can be
   indistinguishable from wall hematoma caused by vertebral artery
   dissection and atherothrombotic occlusive disease.}},

Abstract = {{The NOD-derived islet-reactive CD4(+) T cell clone, BDC-2.5, is able to
   transfer diabetes to neonatal non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice but is
   unable to transfer disease to either adult NOD or NOD scid recipients.
   Transfer of diabetes to adult recipients by BDC-2.5 is only accomplished
   by cotransfer of CD8(+) T cells from a diabetic donor. To understand why
   this CD4(+) T cell clone is able to mediate diabetes in neonatal but not
   the adult recipients we examined the ability of the clone to traffic in
   the different recipients. Our studies showed that MAdCAM-1 has a very
   different expression pattern in the neonatal and adult pancreas.
   Blockade of this addressin prevents the clone from transferring diabetes
   to neonatal mice, suggesting that the differential pancreatic expression
   of MAdCAM-1 in neonatal and adult pancreas provides an explanation of
   the differences in diabetes development.}},

Abstract = {{Since OH circle radicals cannot be measured directly during an ozonation
   process, para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) has been used recently as an OH
   circle radical probe compound during ozonation based on its very slow
   direct reaction with ozone and fast reaction with OH circle radicals.
   However, in experiments of this study it was shown that pCBA accelerated
   ozone decay. Furthermore, the formation oh hydrogen peroxide was
   observed during this process. The formed H2O2 increases the
   decomposition of aqueous ozone and leads to enhanced formation of OH
   circle radicals. The chain reaction therefore changes to HO2- ion
   initiated decay of ozone instead of hydroxide ion, OH-. Thus, an error
   in applying pCBA as a probe compound in low scavenger containing waters
   is likely to occur if the scavenging rate of pCBA makes up more than 5\%
   of the total scavenging rate.}},

   electrical tracking and erosion test using the inclined-plane tracking
   method is conducted to study the overall performance of surface tracking
   properties. The combined effect of leakage current level and carbon

   level of electrical tracking performance based on the proposed
   normalized degradation index. Morphological analysis is also carried out
   to investigate the surface microstructure before and after the tracking
   test. The experimental results show that different material compositions

Title = {{Five genes from chromosomal band 8p22 are significantly down-regulated
   in ovarian carcinoma - N33 and EFA6R have a potential impact on overall
   survival}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosomal band 8p22 is a common
   event in several epithelial tumors including ovarian carcinoma. So far,
   no clear evidence for a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in this region has
   been found.
   METHODS. on the basis of publicly available expression data in ovarian
   tissues, the authors selected the eight most noteworthy genes from 8p22
   (DLC1, N33, ZDHHC2, FLJ32642, PDGFRL, MTSG1, PCM1, and EFA6R) for a
   detailed expression analysis in 58 primary ovarian carcinoma tissues and
   in 38 ovarian cancer cell lines by using quantitative real-time reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Expression data were
   correlated to various clinicopathologic characteristics and survival.
   RESULTS. Two genes showed a significantly (P < 0.05) lower expression in
   grade 3 tumors compared with tumors of lower grade (N33) or compared
   with normal controls and tumors with lower grade (EFA6R). Expression of
   N33 and EFA6R seems to have an impact on survival, in particular when
   the combined expression of both genes was used as predictive factor (P <
   0.003). In addition, N33 and EFA6R showed a complete loss of expression
   in several ovarian cancer cell lines. Three genes (FLJ32642, MTSG1, and
   PCM1) had a significantly (P < 0.001, P < 0.004, and P < 0.001) lower
   expression in primary ovarian carcinoma compared with controls (ovarian
   tissues and cysts).
   CONCLUSIONS. Two to five new potential tumor suppressor or antagonizing
   gene candidates (N33 and EFA6R with impact on survival, and potentially
   FLJ32642, MTSG1, and PCM1) for ovarian carcinoma, were identified from
   the chromosomal band 8p22 and are promising candidates for further
   functional analysis in ovarian carcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{Spin splitting in the integer quantum Hall effect is investigated for a
   series of AlxGa1-xAs/GaAs heterojunctions and quantum wells.
   Magnetoresistance measurements are performed at mK temperature to
   characterize the electronic density of states and estimate the strength
   of many body interactions. A simple model with no free parameters
   correctly predicts the magnetic field required to observe spin
   splitting, confirming that the appearance of spin splitting, is a result
   of a competition between the disorder induced energy cost of flipping
   spins and the exchange energy gain associated with the polarized state.
   In this model, the single particle Zeeman energy plays no role, so that
   the appearance of this quantum Hall ferromagnet in the highest occupied
   Landau level can also be thought of as a magnetic field induced Stoner
   transition.}},

   In-mold rheology and gate-seal analysis were used to select the filling

   effects of filling rate, holding pressure, and mold temperature on the
   appearance characteristics, and a significant influence of these

   obtained with a low melt viscosity at a high shear rate (high injection
   speed or short injection time) and a high mold temperature. This gave a
   higher gloss in the smooth surface regions and a lower gloss in the
   textured regions. An increase in the holding pressure had an effect
   similar to but smaller than increasing the filling rate or mold

Abstract = {{CD38, a surface protein whose expression increases upon normal B-cell
   activation, is a marker of disease aggression in B-cell chronic
   lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Higher percentages of CD38-expressing CLL
   B cells may be found in lymphoid compartments compared to peripheral
   blood. Therefore, it is possible that although CLL B cells are resting,
   CD38 may be a marker of recent cell activation prior to entry into the
   periphery. To address this hypothesis, we examined the association of
   CD38 expression with other activation antigens identified in gene
   expression profiling experiments and include CD18, CD49d, CD20, and
   subunit 5 of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. We found that all
   these markers were more highly expressed in leukemic B cells from
   CD38-positive CLL patients. Lastly, because interferon is known to
   modulate CD38 expression, we used IFN-alpha to test the ability of CLL B
   cells to increase CD38 expression in vitro. Interestingly, IFN
   stimulation only modulated CD38 expression in CLL B cells that already
   expressed CD38. Taken together, these data suggest that CD38 is a marker
   of a more recently activated CLL B cell. This in turn may explain the
   biological and clinical differences between CD38-positive type B-CLL and
   CD38-negative type B-CLL.}},

Abstract = {{Dantrolene is the only drug proven effective for prevention and
   treatment of malignant hyperthermia (MH). Current dosing recommendations
   are based on noncompartmental analyses and are largely empiric. They are
   also divergent, as evidenced by differing recommendations from the
   Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) and
   European Sources. We determined the compartmental pharmacokinetics of
   dantrolene, simulated the concentration time course based on currently
   recommended dosing, and suggest an optimal regimen. Nine volunteers
   (55-89 kg) received IV infusions of dantrolene (5 mg/kg over 30 min
   followed by 0.05 mg (.) kg(-1) (.) h(-1) for 5 h). Venous blood samples
   were drawn for up to 60 h, and dantrolene plasma concentrations were
   determined by reverse phase, high-performance liquid chromatography.
   One, two, and three compartmental models were fitted to the data, and a
   covariate analysis was performed. All calculations were performed with
   NONMEM using the population approach. The data were adequately described
   by a two-compartment model with the following typical variable values
   (median SE): volumes of distribution V-1 = 3.24 +/- 0.61 L; V-2 = 22.9
   +/- 1.53 L; plasma clearance CL,, = 0.03 +/- 0.003 L/min; and
   distributional clearance CLdist = 1.24 +/- 0.22 L/min. All parameters
   were scaled linearly with weight. Simulations of European
   recommendations for treatment of MH lead to plasma concentrations
   converging to 14-18 mg/L within 24 h. Simulating MHAUS guidelines
   (intermittent bolus administration) yielded peak and trough plasma
   concentrations ranging from 6.7-22.6 mg/L. Based on our findings, we
   propose an infusion regimen adjusted to the initial bolus dose(s)
   required to control symptoms. This strategy maintains the individualized
   therapeutic concentrations and improves stability of plasma
   concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Soil-born diseases often cause problems in vegetable forcing; this is
   because growers use greenhouses for the longest time possible. During
   the years several solutions have been found to displace chemical
   control. Grafting is a possible chemical free solution that shows
   several changes in plants thanks to the vigorous rootstock. In this
   study we examined the effect of grafting on the yield and fruit
   characteristics in tomato cultivar. Lemance F-1 was used as scion and
   Beaufort as rootstock. Earliness, total yield, fruit weight and number
   of each graft combination were recorded. Moreover, the main fruit
   components such as Brix degrees, carbohydrate, acid and the
   carbohydrate/acid ratio were analysed. We harvested more yield from the
   grafted plants. The increase of yield was mainly caused by higher
   average fruit weight. Brix degrees and carbohydrate content were lower
   in the fruits on grafted plants than on ungrafted ones but there was no
   significant difference in acid content.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate, in a female
   population-based sample, specific demographic and psychosocial
   predictors of perception of risk for female breast cancer. ne study was
   a cross-sectional survey of 7135 healthy women ranging from 15 to 85
   years. A questionnaire assessed the perceived risk for breast cancer in
   6 German centers. Specified awareness was personal knowledge in relation
   to breast cancer incidence, risk factors, perception, and level of
   concern. An awareness score was defined and related to values of several
   risk factors. Generally, 78.1\% of women were aware of breast cancer.
   However, only one-third (31.2\%) of women estimated the incidence of
   breast cancer correctly; 52\% recognized age, 33.9\% recognized hormonal
   contraceptives, and 34.1\% recognized hormonal replacement therapy as
   factors of breast cancer risk. The most frequent specified sources of
   information were gynecologists (48.4\%). The awareness score of women
   informed by gynecologists was significantly better compared to women
   informed by other health-care professionals. However, a statistically
   significant improvement of the awareness score was reached for women
   with a higher educational level, information seeking by TV, radio,
   printed sources, medical books and health-care flyers. Recommendations
   for improvement of cancer prevention programs include targeting,
   comprehension regarding the lifetime risk of breast cancer, age as a
   risk factor, survival from breast cancer and hormonal factors. According
   to these results, there is an urgent need to separately address the
   perceptions of women, depending on age, social status and educational
   level.}},

   disruptive inpatient behaviour (e.g. aggression), but the number of
   patients treated (n = 4) was too few to allow adequate statistical
   testing. On the basis of the literature, however, it seems fair to
   conclude that in cases posing a high risk of re-offending into hands-on

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to assess health indicators in the city of
   Zagreb in order to evaluate the population health status and health
   needs. A descriptive method was used to analyze data from regular health
   statistics. In the population of Zagreb, the life expectancy at birth is
   longer than the European average but shorter than that recorded in
   Austria and Slovenia. The standardized mortalitay rates of tracheal,
   bronchial and lung cancer, and of malignant diseases in the Zagreb
   population exceed the European average, whereas those of ischemic heart
   disease, cerebrovascular disease, uterine cervix carcinoma and breast
   cancer are lower than the European average. Circulatory diseases and
   neoplasms, the two most important groups of death causes, showed a
   constant rise during the 30-year period (1971-2001). The highest index
   of primary health care utilization (98.8\%) was recorded for the >= 65
   age group, with a mean of 7.5 primary health care visits per capita. The
   prevalence of hypertensive disorders and of intervertebral disk diseases
   and other dorsopathies was significantly higher in the oldest population
   group (chi(2) =27.3 and chi(2)= 13.43, respectively, p < 0.05 both).
   Considering the predominance of chronic widespread diseases that
   substantially influence the patient's quality of life, public health
   actions should primarily be focused on preserving personal autonomy of
   the old and sick man for as long as possible. As the standardized
   mortality rates of ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases,
   tracheal, bronchial and lung cancer, and malignant diseases exceed those
   reported from some neighboring countries, the highest priority and needs
   are now related to coping with unhealthy behavior of the population such
   as smoking, physical inactivity, and dietary issues that should be
   modified and controlled through implementation of preventive programs,
   along with appropriate organization and management of public health
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Many domestic dog breeds have originated through fixation of discrete
   mutations by intense artificial selection. As a result of this process,
   markers in the proximity of genes influencing breed-defining traits will
   have reduced variation (a selective sweep) and will show divergence in
   allele frequency. Consequently, low-resolution genomic scans can
   potentially be used to identify regions containing genes that have a
   major influence oil breed-defining traits. We model the process of breed
   formation and show that the probability of two or three adjacent marker
   loci showing a spurious signal of selection within at least one breed
   (i.e., Type I error or false-positive rate) is low if highly variable
   and moderately spaced markers are utilized. We also use simulations with
   selection to demonstrate that even a moderately spaced set of highly
   polymorphic markers (e.g., one every 0.8 cM) has high power to detect
   regions targeted by strong artificial selection in dogs. Further, we
   show that a gene responsible for black coat color in the Large
   Munsterlander has a 40-Mb region surrounding the gene that is very low
   in heterozygosity foi microsatellite markers. Similarly, we survey 302
   microsatellite markers in the Dachshund and find three linked
   monomorphic microsatellite markers all within a 10-Mb region on
   chromosome 3. This region contains the FGFR3 gene, which is responsible
   for achondroplasia in humans, but not in dogs. Consequently, our results
   Suggest that the causative mutation is a gene or regulatory region
   closely linked to FURS.}},

Title = {{Familiar history and predictive risk factors to type 2 diabetes: a cross
   sectional study in young Sicilian subjects of both sexes}},
Journal = {{PANMINERVA MEDICA}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim. For many industrialised populations, family history to type 2
   diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor to the development of illness,
   inducing early anthropometric and metabolic modifications. Aim of this
   study was to confirm in Sicilian population the influence of family
   history to type 2 DM on anthropometric data and basal blood pressure,
   considering the different degrees of familiar history to illness.
   Methods. In a cohort of 680 young healthy Sicilian subjects (278 men and
   402 women) we analysed the relations of family history degree of DM on
   anthropometric data, such as body mass index (BMI), waist/hip ratio
   (WHR) and triceps skin-fold. Degree of family history of DM was defined
   as presence in the family of at least one sibling of first degree or a
   parent with documented DM (FHDM++), of at least one family member of
   second degree with documented DM (FHDM+).
   Results. In both sexes the FHDM++ groups showed the highest values of
   body weight (P < 0.001 for men, P < 0.0001 for women), BMI (P < 0.0005
   for both sexes), WHR (P < 0.0001 for men, P < 0.01 for women), triceps
   skinfold (P < 0.0001 for men, P < 0.001 for women), with consequently
   higher proportion of obesity and overweight in the group with FHDM++.
   Subjects with FHDM+ were closer to control subject without family
   history of DM. FHDM++ was also associated with tendency to higher
   diastolic and systolic blood pressure values in both sexes.
   Conclusion. The study shows that young subjects with familiar history of
   type 2 diabetes have a higher prevalence of overweight and central
   obesity compared to other groups, suggesting that obesity in adolescents
   and young adults may be a strong pathophysiologic mechanism predictive
   of higher degree of future development of type 2 diabetes and
   hypertension.}},

Title = {{Mild acid hydrolysis of sulfated fucans: a selective 2-desulfation
   reaction and an alternative approach for preparing tailored sulfated
   oligosaccharides}},
Journal = {{GLYCOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sulfated fucans from marine invertebrates have simple, linear
   structures, composed of repeating units of oligosaccharides. Most of
   these polysaccharides contain 3-linked fucosyl units, but each species
   of invertebrate has a specific pattern of sulfation. No specific enzyme
   able to cleave or to desulfate these polysaccharides has been described
   yet. Therefore, we employed an alternative approach, based on mild acid
   hydrolysis, in an attempt to obtain low molecular-weight derivatives
   from sulfated fucans. Surprisingly, we observed that sulfated fucans
   from Lytechinus variegatus and Strongylocentrotus pallidus (but not the
   sulfated fucans from other species) yield by mild acid hydrolysis
   oligosaccharides with well-defined molecular size as shown by narrow
   bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The sulfated
   oligosaccharides obtained by mild acid hydrolysis were purified by
   gel-filtration chromatography, and their structures were identified by
   H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, revealing an
   identical chemical composition for all oligosaccharides. When we
   followed the acid hydrolysis by H-1-NMR spectroscopy, we found that a
   selective 2-desulfation occurs in the fucans from S. pallidus and from
   L. variegatus. The reaction has two stages. Initially, 2-sulfate esters
   at specific sites are removed. Then the desulfated units are cleaved,
   yielding oligosaccharides with well-defined molecular size. The apparent
   requirement for the selective 2-desulfation is the occurrence of an
   exclusively 2-sulfated fucosyl unit linked to or preceded by a
   4-sulfated residue. Thus, a homofucan from Strongylocentrotus
   franciscanus resists desulfation by mild acid hydrolysis, because it
   lacks the neighboring 4-sulfated unit. Overall, our results show a new
   approach for desulfating sulfated fucans at specific sites and obtaining
   tailored sulfated oligosaccharides.}},

Abstract = {{Two Lateglacial insect sequences are described (a) from Conty, in the
   Selle valley and (b) from Houdancourt in the Oise valley, both in
   northern France. These investigations are part of a multidisciplinary
   investigation involving archaeology, sedimentology, geomorphology,
   geochronology and palaeontology (pollen, macroscopic plant remains,
   vertebrates, molluscs and insect fossils). The sequences of insect
   assemblages date from the latter part of the Boiling to the end of the
   Allerod periods. Environmental analysis of these faunas shows that
   rivers with riffles and pools meandered across flood plains. The river
   was extensively fringed with reedy vegetation. The only trees growing
   close to the river were of Salix and/or Populus. All the insect
   assemblages indicate that the thermal climates during the Boiling and
   Allerod periods were similar to one another and during both periods were
   very nearly as warm as that of the present day. No insect fossils were
   recovered from the sediments attributed to the Older Dryas interval
   though other evidence from these sites suggests that this event was
   decidedly colder than those immediately preceding and succeeding it.
   Comparisons are made between Lateglacial climatic patterns in northern
   France with those elsewhere in Europe. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   we study the implications of using an approximate algorithm and we show

Abstract = {{A major component in green tea, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), is
   reported to interfere with different steps of a number of inflammatory
   pathways. After oral administration, EGCG is retained in the
   gastrointestinal tract, where it is thought to exert preventive
   functions against inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. In this
   study, the human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines HT29 and T84 were used
   to investigate the effect of EGCG on intestinal inflammation. HT29 and
   T84 cells were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha to
   induce the inflammatory condition and to trigger the inflammatory
   cascade in vitro and treated with EGCG to study its effect on
   inflammatory processes. The secretion of the chemokines interleukin
   (IL)-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3 alpha, and prostaglandin
   E-2 (PGE(2)) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The
   gene expression level was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase
   chain reaction. Treatment of TNF-alpha-stimulated HT29 cells with EGCG
   dose- dependently inhibited the synthesis of IL-8, MIP-3 alpha, and
   PGE(2). Treatment with EGCG also inhibited the production of IL-8 and
   MIP-3 alpha in TNF-alpha- stimulated T84 cells. Gene expression analysis
   in both HT29 and T84 cells revealed that EGCG down-regulates genes
   involved in inflammatory pathways. This study shows that EGCG acts
   broadly on the production of chemokines and PGE(2) in the chemokine and
   eicosanoid pathways of colon epithelial cells. Therefore, EGCG might
   prove useful for the prevention and/ or attenuation of colonic
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is widely used for
   the clinical evaluation of Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed the
   rater variability of the UPDRS Motor examination (UPDRS-ME) of nurse
   practitioners, residents in neurology, and a movement disorders
   specialist (MDS) compared to a senior MDS. We assessed the videotaped
   UPDRS-ME of 50 PD patients. Inter-rater and intra-rater variability were
   estimated using weighted kappa (kappa(w)) and intraclass correlation
   coefficients (ICC). Additionally, inter-rater agreement was quantified
   by calculation of the mean difference between 2 raters and its 95\%
   limits of agreement. Intra-rater agreement was also estimated by
   calculation of a 95\% repeatability limits. The K, and ICC statistics
   indicated good to very good inter-rater and intra-rater reliability for
   the majority of individual UPDRS items and the sum score of the UPDRS-ME
   in all raters. However, for inter-rater agreement, it appeared that both
   nurses, residents, and the MDS consistently assigned higher scores than
   the senior MDS. Mean differences ranged between 1.7 and 5.4 (all
   differences P < 0.05), with rather wide 95\% limits of agreement. The
   intra-rater 95\% repeatability limits were rather wide. We found
   considerable rater difference for the whole range of UPDRS-ME scores
   between a senior MDS and nurse practitioners, residents in neurology,
   and the MDS. This finding suggests that the amount by which raters may
   disagree should be quantified before starting longitudinal studies of
   disease progression or clinical trials. Finally, evaluation of rater
   agreement should always include the assessment of the extent of bias
   between different raters. (c) 2005 Movement Disorder Society.}},

Journal = {{ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{130}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2916-2927}},

Abstract = {{A programmable, real-time, digital signal processing (DSP),
   least-mean-squares (LMS) interference canceler was developed and
   demonstrated as a successful method of excising the GLONASS satellite
   L-band downlink signals from the 100 m Green Bank Telescope (GBT). This
   canceler has the potential for aiding the observation of redshifted OH
   lines near 1600 MHz in the presence of GLONASS signals. Our canceler
   approach is similar to experiments reported by Barnbaum and Bradley,
   Baan et al., and Kesteven et al. for mitigating ground-based radio
   frequency interference (RFI), but we add the new features of a tracking
   dish antenna to follow the satellite for improved cancellation
   performance, complex adaptive filter coefficients that reduce the
   required filter length, and a programmable delay line for bulk time
   delay correction. An analysis of LMS tracking performance for moving
   satellites is presented, and effective use of a reference antenna
   distantly located from the telescope is demonstrated. As is expected
   from the known properties of LMS cancelers, larger filter orders are
   shown to yield more reliable cancellation and are less sensitive to data
   time misalignment. GLONASS interference seen by the GBT was suppressed
   below the noise floor without corrupting a signal that simulated an
   astronomical source, even with rapid orbital transits and long
   integration times.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of an add-on module for the WHOQOL
   measures of quality of life (QoL) for use with older adults. The add-on
   module, known as the WHOQOL-OLD, was derived following standard WHOQOL
   methodology. In the pilot phase of the study, 22 centres from around the
   world carried out focus groups with older adults, with carers, and with
   professionals working with older adults in order to identify gaps in the
   coverage of the WHOQOL-100 that were relevant for QoL in older adults.
   Items generated from the focus groups were then tested in over 7400
   respondents from the centres, with items being tested and reduced using
   both classical and modern psychometric methods. These analyses indicated
   a further gap in the coverage of the items, so further items were
   generated that specifically assessed intimate relations in older adults.
   A field trial study was then carried out in a further approximately 5500
   respondents, again with the use of both classical and modern
   psychometric methods. The outcome of this second round of data
   collection and analysis is a 24-item 6-facet module which can be used in
   conjunction with the WHOQOL-BREF or the WHOQOL-100 for assessment of QoL
   in older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Four Neotropical tiger beetle species, three from the genus Megacephala
   and one from the genus Oxycheila, currently assigned to the tribe
   Megacephalini were examined cytogenetically. All three Megacephala
   species showed simple sex chromosome systems of the XO/XX type but
   different numbers of autosomal pairs (15 in M. cruciata, 14 in M.
   sobrina and 12 in M. rutilans), while Oxycheila tristis was inferred to
   have a multiple sex chromosome system with four X chromosomes (2n = 24
   +X1X2X3X4Y/X1X1X2X2X3X3X4X4). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
   using a PCR-amplified 18S rDNA fragment as a probe revealed the presence
   of rDNA clusters located exclusively on the autosomes in all the
   Megacephala species (five clusters in M. cruciata, eight in M. sobrina
   and three in M. rutilans), indicating variability in the number of
   clusters and the presence of structural polymorphisms. The same
   methodology showed that O. tristis had six rDNA clusters, apparently
   also located on the autosomes. Although our data also show cytogenetic
   variability within the genus Megacephala, our findings support the most
   accepted hypothesis for chromosome evolution in the family Cicindelidae.
   The description of multiple sex chromosomes in O. tristis along with
   phylogenetic analyses and larval morphological characters may be assumed
   as an additional evidence for the exclusion of the genus Oxycheila and
   related taxa from the tribe Megacephalini.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. This study was undertaken to evaluate knowledge of cervical
   dysplasia and human papillomavirus (HPV) among women seen in a
   colposcopy clinic.
   Study design. Demographics, knowledge, and psychological distress were
   assessed in structured interviews with 175 women before, during, and
   after colposcopy.
   Results. Respondents had low knowledge scores before and after
   colposcopy; however, their overall knowledge improved slightly (P 0.013)
   following the exam. When responses were examined by question,
   respondents demonstrated a significant increase of correct answers to
   only one question: Does dysplasia, or precancerous cells on the cervix,
   always go away without treatment? Pre-exam knowledge was positively
   associated with educational level and was lower among Hispanics and
   patients recruited at the clinic. Post-exam knowledge was positively
   associated with pre-exam knowledge and educational level.
   Conclusion. Routine clinical education during colposcopy can improve
   patients' understanding of cervical cancer; however, the low level of
   knowledge that persisted after colposcopy is a cause for concern. (C)

Abstract = {{Background The global burden of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV),
   and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection due to percutaneous
   injuries among health care workers (HCWs) is estimated.
   Methods The incidence of infections attributable to percutaneous
   injuries in 14 geographical regions on the basis of the probability of
   injury, the prevalence of infection, the susceptibility of the worker,
   and the percutaneous transmission potential are modeled. The model also
   provides the attributable fractions of infection in HCWs.
   Results Overall, 16,000 HCV, 66,000 HBVs and 1,000 HIV infections may
   have occurred in the year 2000 worldwide among HCWs due to their
   occupational exposure to percutaneous injuries. The fraction of
   infections with HCV, HBV, and HIV in HCWs attributable to occupational
   exposure to percutaneous injuries fraction reaches 39\%, 37\%, and 4.4\%
   respectively.
   Conclusions Occupational exposures to percutaneous injuries are
   substantial source of infections with bloodborne pathogens among
   health-care workers (HCWs). These infections are highly preventable and
   should be eliminated. Am. J. Ind. Med. 48:482-490, 2005. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The immunosuppressive activity of the ethanol extract of Pollen Typhae

   with OVA on days 0 and 14. Beginning on the day of immunization, the
   mice were administered intraperitoneally with EEPT at a single dose of
   0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg at intervals of 7 days for a total of five doses.
   On day 28, antigen-specific antibodies in serum, and mitogen- and

Abstract = {{SDE1/SGS2/RDR6, a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) from
   Arabidopsis thaliana, has previously been found to be indispensable for
   maintaining the posttranscriptional silencing of transgenes, but it is
   seemingly redundant for antiviral defense. To elucidate the antiviral
   role of this RdRP in a different host plant and to evaluate whether
   plant growth conditions affect its role, we down-regulated expression of
   the Nicotiana benthamiana homolog, NbRDR6, and examined the plants for
   altered susceptibility to various viruses at different growth
   temperatures. The results we describe here clearly show that plants with
   reduced expression of NbRDR6 were more susceptible to all viruses tested
   and that this effect was more pronounced at higher growth temperatures.
   Diminished expression of NbRDR6 also permitted efficient multiplication
   of tobacco mosaic virus in the shoot apices, leading to serious
   disruption with microRNA-mediated developmental regulation. Based on
   these results, we propose that NbRDR6 participates in the antiviral RNA
   silencing pathway that is stimulated by rising temperatures but
   suppressed by virus-encoded silencing suppressors. The relative
   strengths of these two factors, along with other plant defense
   components, critically influence the outcome of virus infections.}},

Abstract = {{The geometry, electronic configurations, harmonic vibrational

   dimers and trimers, the lowest energy structures are planar cumulenic
   rings (IIs, VIs) with D-nh symmetry. The caged structure with T-d
   symmetry (IXs) lie lowest in energy among the tetramers. The Al-As bond
   dominates the structures for many isomers so that one preferred
   dissociation channel is loss of the AlAs monomer. The atomic charges,
   hybridization and chemical bonding in the different structures are also
   discussed. Comparisons with valence-isoelectronic Si-2n, AlnPn and
   GanAsn clusters of same size, the properties of the aluminum arsenide
   clusters are analogous to those of their corresponding AlnPn,Si-2n
   counterparts. The results can explain the modification and refinement of

Abstract = {{An ab initio calculation of the He-4(e,e(')p)H-3 longitudinal response
   is presented. The full four-body final-state interaction is taken into
   account by using an integral transform approach with a Lorentzian
   kernel. The semirealistic nucleon-nucleon potential MTI-III, including
   the Coulomb force, is the only ingredient of the calculation. The
   reliability of the direct knock-out hypothesis is discussed in both
   parallel and nonparallel kinematics. In the former case, lower missing
   momenta and higher momentum transfers are found to minimize effects
   beyond the plane-wave impulse approximation. For nonparallel kinematics,
   the role of antisymmetrization and the final-state interaction become
   more and more important as the missing momentum increases, raising
   doubts about the possibility of extracting momentum distributions and
   spectroscopic factors. The comparison with experimental data is
   discussed for parallel kinematics, in which a Rosenbluth separation is
   possible.}},

Abstract = {{Three groups of Siboney de Cuba calves of 1, 4 and 11 months of age,
   with 20 animals each, located at the rearing unit 907 from the Genetics
   Enterprise of Nazareno, Havana province, were used to determine their
   ingestive behavior during the rainy and dry seasons. The method was the
   visual observation (every 10 min) of their ingestive behavior, for 48 h
   in the second, fourth and last month of each season, during the day and
   night. Simultaneously, the room temperature was controlled through the
   calculation of the index temperature humidity (ITH). The statistical
   software SPSS was used for processing the results and the analysis of
   proportions was applied according to the test of Chi square (X-2) and
   that of Duncan (1955) when necessary. The different ages were considered
   independent and the correlations and regressions between this activity
   and the ITH were performed through INFOSTAT per hour, phase (day and
   night) and in each season. According to the results, it is concluded
   that the animals increased the ingestive circadian time as they grow
   older, regardless the season, and, at the same time, they express the
   natural behavior pattern of ingestive preference in day phase. The
   effect of the season did not influence on the total number of animal per
   phase, but on their distribution intra- and inter-phases.}},

   (fMRI) can now also image blood flow over time, allowing researchers to
   see which areas of the brain are active during certain tasks. A yet
   newer extension is MRI spectroscopy, another kind of functional imaging
   that monitors the activity of particular chemicals in the
   brain-providing different clues to brain function than fMRI does. And
   most recently, researchers have pioneered an MRI technique called
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that produces 3-D images of the frail,

Abstract = {{Objective: Retrospective studies suggest that laparoscopic excision of
   endometriomas is associated with a reduced responsiveness to ovarian
   hyperstimulation. In this study, we prospectively evaluated ovarian
   response to hyperstimulation in women selected for in vitro
   fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles who previously
   underwent laparoscopic enucleation of a monolateral endometrioma.
   Study design: Operated and contralateral intact ovaries of the same
   patient were compared ill terms of number of follicles, number of
   oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and rate of high-quality embryos.
   Results: Thirty-eight subjects were included. A reduced number of
   dominant follicles, oocytes, embryos, and high-quality embryos was
   observed in the operated gonad. The mean percentage of reduction was
   60\% (95\% confidence interval 38-81\%), 53\% (95\% confidence interval
   30-75\%), 55\% (95\% confidence interval 28-81\%), and 52\% (95\%
   confidence interval 17-87\%), respectively. Fertilization rate and rate
   of good-quality embryos were similar.

Journal = {{PHYTOPATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1381-1390}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The fungus Cylindrocarpon destructans (Zins) Scholten is the cause of
   root rot (disappearing root rot) in many ginseng production areas in
   Canada. A total of 80 isolates of C. destructans were recovered from
   diseased roots in a survey of ginseng gardens in British Columbia from
   2002-2004. Among these isolates, 49\% were classified as highly virulent
   (causing lesions on unwounded mature roots) and 51\% were weakly
   virulent (causing lesions only on previously wounded roots). Pectinase
   and polyphenoloxidase enzymes were produced in vitro by C. destructans
   isolates when they were grown on pectin and phenol as a substrate,
   respectively. However, highly virulent isolates produced significantly
   (P < 0.001) higher enzyme levels compared with weakly virulent isolates.
   Histopathological studies of ginseng roots inoculated with a highly
   virulent isolate revealed direct hyphal penetration through the
   epidermis, followed by intracellular hyphal growth in the cortex.
   Subsequent cell disintegration and accumulation of phenolic compounds
   was observed. Radial growth of highly and weakly virulent isolates on
   potato dextrose agar was highest at 18 and 21 degrees C, respectively
   and there was no growth at 35 degrees C. Mycelial mass production as
   significantly (P <= 0.01) lower at pH 7.0 compared with pH 5.0. To study
   the effects of pH (5.0 and 7.0) and wounding on disease development,
   ginseng roots were grown hydroponically in Hoagland's solution. Lesions
   were significantly larger (P < 0.001) at pH 5.0 compared with pH 7.0 and
   wounding enhanced disease by a highly virulent isolate at both pHs. In
   artificially infested soil, 2-year-old ginseng roots were most
   susceptible to Cylindrocarpon root rot among all root ages tested (I to
   4 years) when evaluated using a combined scale of disease incidence and
   severity. Root rot severity was significantly (P < 0.002) enhanced by
   increasing the inoculum density from 3.45 x 10(2) CFU/g of soil to 1.86
   x 10(3) CFU/g of soil. Disease severity was higher at 20 degrees C
   compared with 15 and 25 degrees C and at -0.02 MPa soil moisture
   compared with -0.005 and -0.001 MPa. A significant interaction between
   soil moisture and temperature was observed for root rot severity.}},

Abstract = {{Alveolar soft part sarcoma and pediatric renal cell carcinoma share a
   similar chromosomal abnormality, t(X;17)(p11.2;q25). Recently, it has
   been suggested that the inactivation of DNA mismatch repair genes hMLH1
   and hMSH2 may play an additional role in the pathogenesis of alveolar
   soft part sarcoma. Immunohistochemical expression of the proteins hMLH1
   and hMSH2 is indicative of the activation status of the corresponding
   genes. We performed immunohistochemistry for hMLH1 and hMSH2 in 4 cases
   of pediatric renal cell carcinomas with Xp11.2 rearrangements. All cases
   showed nuclear immunoreactivity for both proteins, although the staining
   was patchy. Our study demonstrates that inactivation of the DNA mismatch
   repair genes hMLH1 and hMSH2 does not appear to play a role in the
   tumorigenesis of pediatric renal cell carcinomas with Xp11.2

Abstract = {{Thin fibrils (usually 20-100 nm in diameter) of ferroelectric
   PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 have a preferred nucleation and growth in the {[}001]
   direction in small particles. X-ray diffraction with the X-ray beam
   facing the fibril surfaces, which lie along the {[}001] direction, thus
   involves reflections of manifested intensity from (100) and (010)
   planes. No reflection occurs from the perpendicular planes to the
   {[}001] fibrils. A transmission electron micrograph with the
   corresponding electron diffraction from fibrils confers the results of
   the preferred growth. The fibrils have a modified orthorhombic crystal
   structure of lattice parameters a=0.4038 nm, b=0.4017 nm, and c=04148
   nm, with an enhanced 8.033 g/cm(3) density over 8.006 g/cm(3) in the
   usual tetragonal structure of a=0.4036 nm and c=04146 nm. Surface
   anisotropy in a fibril that imposes (and drives) a shear stress over
   growing crystallites (within the fibril) along the {[}001] surface
   favors this specific crystal structure in them according to the
   precursor structure. A single-phase sample is obtained in 2 h by heating
   of an amorphous template of precursor (of the metal cations with a
   polymer of polyvinyl alcohol and sucrose) at 500 degrees-800 degrees C

Abstract = {{Background: Low folate status is associated with poor cognitive function
   and dementia in the elderly. Since 1998, grain products in the United
   States have been fortified with folic acid, which has reduced the
   prevalence of folate deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia.
   Objective: We investigated whether folate status is associated with
   cognitive function and dementia in a cohort of elderly Latinos (aged >=
   60 y; n = 1789) exposed to folic acid fortification.
   Design: Global cognitive function was assessed by the Modified
   Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) and specific cognitive functions by
   cross-culturally validated neuropsychological tests. Dementia was
   diagnosed according to the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic
   and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition revised, and
   California Alzheimer Disease Diagnostic and Treatment criteria. Red
   blood cell (RBC) folate was measured by automated chemiluminescence and
   total plasma homocysteine by HPLC.
   Results: The prevalence of folate deficiency (RBC folate <= 160 ng/mL)
   was <1\%. After control for confounding by homocysteine, vitamin B-12,
   creatinine, demographic variables, and depressive symptom score, RBC
   folate was directly associated with 3MSE (P = 0.005) and delayed recall
   (P = 0.007) scores. In addition, adjusted odds ratios for low 3MSE score
   (!;78) and dementia diagnosis per unit increase in RBC folate were
   significantly below unity (P 0.008), which indicated that the relative
   risks of cognitive impairment and dementia decreased with increasing RBC
   folate concentration. In contrast, adjusted odds ratios for low 3MSE
   score and dementia diagnosis per unit increase in homocysteine were not
   significant.
   Conclusion: RBC folate is directly associated with cognitive function
   scores and is inversely associated with dementia in elderly Latinos
   despite folic acid fortification.}},

Abstract = {{Background Deficiencies in implementation of secondary prevention of
   coronary heart disease (CHD) have been identified. We explored the
   extent of medication use for secondary prevention of CHD since the
   introduction of the National Service Framework (NSF) for CHD and the
   influence of patient age, social class, region and time since diagnosis
   in older British men.
   Methods Prospective study in 24 British towns using patient information
   on medication use in 1998-2000 and 2003. Subjects were men with
   medically recorded diagnosis of myocardial infarction or angina, aged
   62-85 years in 2003. Prevalence of medication use (aspirin, statins,
   angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers) in
   1998-2000 and 2003 was ascertained.
   Results Prevalence of use of all drugs increased in 2003 and was
   markedly higher in patients with a history of myocardial infarction than
   angina. Older age was related to lower prevalence of drug use,
   particularly statins. In 2000, older subjects (74-85 years) were 60\%
   {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) = 41-72 per cent] less likely to
   receive statins compared with younger subjects (62-73 years); this
   pattern changed very little between 2000 and 2003. Although social class
   appeared to have little relation to drug use, the prevalence of use of
   all medications decreased with increasing time since diagnosis.
   Conclusions Although the uptake of medications for secondary prevention
   in CHD patients increased since the NSF in 2000, marked age inequalities
   in statin use were present both in 1998-2000 and 2003. Further action is
   needed to reduce these inequalities, because older patients are at
   particularly high risk of recurrent and fatal CHD.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{456-479}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the potential of multicolor photometry for partial mode
   identification in both long- and short-period variable subdwarf B stars.
   The technique presented is based on the fact that the frequency
   dependence of an oscillation's amplitude and phase bears the signature
   of the mode's degree index l, among other things. Unknown contributing
   factors can be eliminated through the evaluation of the amplitude ratios
   and phase differences arising from the brightness variation in different
   wavebands, theoretically enabling the inference of the degree index from
   observations in two or more bandpasses. Employing a designated model
   atmosphere code, we calculate the brightness variation expected across
   the visible disk during a pulsation cycle in terms of temperature,
   radius, and surface gravity perturbations to the emergent flux for
   representative EC 14026 and PG 1716 star models. Nonadiabatic effects
   are considered in detail and found to be significant from nonadiabatic
   pulsation calculations applied to our state-of-the-art models of
   subdwarf B stars. Our results indicate that the brightness variations
   observed in subdwarf B stars are caused primarily by changes in
   temperature and radius, with surface gravity perturbations playing a
   small role. For PG 1716 stars, temperature effects dominate in the limit
   of long periods with the result that the oscillatory amplitudes and
   phases lose their period dependence and nonadiabatic effects become
   unimportant. Outside this regime, however, their values are strongly
   influenced by both factors. We find that the phase shifts between
   brightness variations in different wavebands are generally small but may
   lie above the experimental detection threshold in certain cases. The
   prospect of mode discrimination seems much more promising on the basis
   of the corresponding amplitude ratios. While in EC 14026 stars the
   amplitude ratios predicted are very similar for modes with l = 0, 1, or
   2, they are well separated from those of modes with l = 3, l = 5, and l
   = 4 or 6, each of which form a distinct group. For the case of the PG
   1716 stars it should be possible to discriminate between modes with l =
   1, 2, 4, or 6 and those of degree indices l = 3 and l = 5. Identifying
   modes within a given group is challenging for both types of pulsator and
   requires multicolor photometry of extremely high quality. Nevertheless,
   we demonstrate that it is feasible using the example of the largest
   amplitude peak detected for the fast pulsator KPD 2109+4401 by Jeffery
   et al.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate test methods for hip and knee muscle weakness and
   gait disturbance.
   Design: Test-retest.
   Setting: Orthopedic university clinic.
   Participants: Ten young (age, 36 +/- 6y) and 13 elderly (age, 69 +/- 8y)
   healthy volunteers and 11 patients (age, 69 8y) with unilateral hip
   osteoarthritis (OA) were tested for muscular strength. Twenty-five
   volunteers (age, 42 +/- 14y) underwent gait analysis.
   Interventions: A dynamometer assessing maximal voluntary isometric force
   of hip and knee muscles and an optosensor walkway detecting limp were
   developed. Tests evaluated reproducibility and tolerance in patients
   with OA and elderly subjects.
   Main Outcome Measures: Relative coefficient of variation (CV\%) and
   force (in newtons).
   Results: CV\% for unilateral strength measurements ranged from 7\% to
   12\% for specific muscle groups. CV\% for gait parameters ranged from
   4\% to 8\%, except for the double-support phase. Tests were well
   tolerated, and no patient had to discontinue because of fatigue.
   Differences related to sex, age, and disease were detected.
   Conclusions: Our dynamometer system provides reliable measurements of
   hip and knee muscle strength in young and old people, and variation is
   comparable to previous data. Our photocell technique for gait analysis
   is reliable in people with normal gait. Both methods are attractive
   because they are affordable, nonstationary, and easy to use.}},

Abstract = {{A phase-field lattice kinetic model is presented for the numerical
   simulation of the dendritic growth of a pure crystal in the presence of
   thermal transport. A finite-difference scheme for the phase field is
   combined with an explicit lattice kinetic scheme for the temperature
   field. The resulting scheme is advanced in time with an adaptive
   time-marching procedure which permits us to achieve long simulation
   times with larger time steps than explicit finite-difference and
   previous kinetic methods. The method is demonstrated for the case of
   dendritic growth of a single crystal over a wide range of Stefan and

   administration of FMPD selectively elevated the number of spontaneously

   selectively decreased the number of spontaneously active A10 ( versus
   A9) dopamine neurons. FMPD did not produce catalepsy at doses lower than
   25 mg/kg p.o. In Fos-induction studies, FMPD had an atypical
   antipsychotic profile in the striatum and nucleus accumbens and
   increased Fos expression in orexin-containing neurons of the
   hypothalamus. FMPD produced only a transient elevation of prolactin
   levels. These data indicate that FMPD is an orally available potent
   antagonist of dopamine D-2, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT6 receptors and a weak
   antagonist of H-1 and 5-HT2C receptors. FMPD has the potential to have
   efficacy in treating schizophrenia and bipolar mania with a low risk of
   treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin elevation, and
   weight gain. Clinical trials are needed to test these hypotheses.}},

   employed for detection of PGR- and EGR-specific immunoreactivity in MECh
   samples using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The
   positive results were verified with reverse transcriptase polymerase
   chain reaction (RT-PCR). The morphological study revealed stable

   Weaker immunoreactivity for PGR was demonstrated in external auditory
   canal skin (EACS) samples in comparison with MECh, while PGR-specific
   staining was not observed in retroauricular skin (RAS) samples. EGR was
   detected only at mRNA levels. Stronger expression of EGR PCR products
   was disclosed in female cholesteatoma samples, while PGR mRNA was
   predominantly detected in male cholesteatoma specimens. Our preliminary

Abstract = {{Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant central
   nervous system neoplasm that usually affects very young children and is
   typically deadly despite very aggressive treatment. Considered rare, the

   similar features with other primitive tumors. Although AT/RT has become
   increasingly recognized, published data has been based on small series
   and are retrospective. Based on these data, there are occasional
   long-term survivors, most of whom received intensive multi-modal
   therapy. AT/RT is the first pediatric brain tumor for which a candidate
   tumor suppressor gene has been identified. A mutation or deletion in the
   INI1 gene occurs in the majority of AT/RT tumors. The function of the
   gene is not yet understood. Prospective clinical and biologic trials are

Abstract = {{In the present work it is shown that low nanoparticle-loaded polymer
   composites with improved mechanical performance can be prepared by a
   conventional melt blending technique in which the nanoparticles are
   chemically pregrafted by diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA). Two
   composites, each with 2.5 wt\% filler, were developed. The first one was
   obtained by melt blending propylene-ethylene copolymer (EP) with
   nanosilica in a co-rotating sigma internal mixer. The second one was
   obtained by melt blending the same EP, but with DGEBA grafted
   nanosilica. The addition of epoxy resin grafted nanosilica to the
   polymer matrix produced a homogeneous dispersion of particles in the
   form of micro domains. The results of tensile tests indicate that epoxy
   resin grafted nanosilica particles (SiO2-g-DGEBA) provide EP with
   stiffening, strengthening, and toughening effects at a 2.5 wt\% loading
   level. This is a much lower level compared to most particulate fillers
   used for composites. There was no noticeable improvement in the
   mechanical properties when nanosilica was added to the neat polymer.
   However, the addition of SiO2-g-DGEBA particles to the polymer matrix
   led to an increase of both elastic modulus and toughness (from 0.36 to
   0.54 GPa, and 19.06 to 21.05 MJ/m(3), respectively).}},

Abstract = {{An ultrasonic pulse incident on a lubricating oil film in a machine
   element will be partially reflected and partially transmitted. The
   proportion of the wave amplitude reflected, termed the reflection
   coefficient, depends on the film thickness and the acoustic properties
   of the oil. When the appropriate ultrasonic frequency is used, the
   magnitude of the reflection coefficient can be used to determine the oil
   film thickness. However, the reflected wave has both a real component
   and an imaginary component, and both the amplitude and the phase are
   functions of the film thickness. The phase of the reflected wave will be
   shifted from that of the incident wave when it is reflected. In the
   present study, this phase shift is explored as the film changes and is
   evaluated as an alternative means to measure oil film thickness.
   A quasi-static theoretical model of the reflection response from an oil
   film has been, developed. This model relates the phase shift to the wave
   frequency and the film properties. Measurements of reflection
   coefficient from a static model oil film and also from a rotating
   journal bearing have been recorded. These have been used to determine
   the oil film thickness using both amplitude and phase shift methods. In
   both cases, the results agree closely with independent assessments of
   the oil film thickness. The model of ultrasonic reflection is further
   extended to incorporate mass and damping terms. Experiments show that
   both the mass and the internal damping of the oil films tested in this
   work have a negligible effect on ultrasonic reflection.
   A potentially very useful application for the simultaneous measurement
   of reflection coefficient amplitude and phase is that the data can be
   used to negate the need for a reference. The theoretical relationship
   between phase and amplitude is fitted to the data. An extrapolation is
   performed to determine the values of amplitude and phase for an
   infinitely thick layer. This is equivalent to the reference signal
   determined by measuring the reflection coefficient directly, but
   importantly does not require the materials to be separated. This
   provides a simple and effective means of continuously calibrating the
   film measurement approach.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the usefulness of the General Behavior Inventory
   (GBI) to predict the development of mood disorders in the offspring of
   parents with bipolar disorder. Method: The GBI and the K-SADS (first
   measurement) and the SCID (last measurement) were used to assess
   psychopathology among 129 adolescent and young adult offspring of a
   bipolar parent with an interval of 5 years. Based on the SCID results at
   the last measurement, the offspring were assigned to one of four groups:
   with bipolar mood disorder, with unipolar mood disorders, with non-mood
   disorders and without disorders and GBI-scores at the first measurement
   were compared across the four groups. Results: The scores on the
   Depression scale of the GBI for the offspring who later developed a
   bipolar or any mood disorder were significantly higher than for the
   offspring who did not develop a mood disorder across a 5-year interval.
   For the offspring with a unipolar mood disorder at the first
   measurement, the scores on the Depression scale were significantly
   higher for those who switched to bipolar disorder versus those who
   remained unipolar. Conclusions: The GBI can be used in a high-risk
   sample of offspring of parents with bipolar disorder as a self-report
   measure as an aid to detect those who will develop bipolar disorder
   across a 5-year interval. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Consistent evidence indicates that some, but not most, patients
   with schizophrenia have below-average intelligence years before they
   manifest psychosis. However, it is not clear whether this below-average
   premorbid intelligence is stable or progressive.
   Objective: To examine whether increased risk for schizophrenia is
   associated with declining intellectual performance from childhood
   through adolescence.
   Design: Historical cohort study of an entire population using record
   linkage for psychiatric hospitalization during an 8- to 17-year
   follow-up period.
   Setting: Mandatory assessment by the draft board of Israeli conscripts.
   Participants: Population-based cohort of 555 326 adolescents born in
   Israel. Data were available on 4 intelligence subtests as well as on
   reading and spelling abilities and on behavioral and psychosocial
   variables. A regression-based approach was used to assess the
   discrepancy between actual IQ at age 17 years and estimated IQ during
   childhood based on reading and spelling abilities.
   Main Outcome Measures: Hospitaltzation for schizophrenia (as per the
   International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision
   criteria).
   Results: Lower-than-expected IQ at age 17 years was associated with
   increased risk for later hospitalization for schizophrenia. Results were
   held after controlling for potential confounders. For 75\% of patients
   with schizophrenia with low actual IQ (<85) at age 17 years and for 23\%
   of patients with actual IQ within the normal range ( >= 85), actual IQ
   was 10 or more points lower than expected. Lower-than-expected 10 was
   not associated with bipolar disorder or with depression or anxiety
   disorder.
   Conclusions: Indirect evidence suggests that intellectual deterioration
   from childhood through adolescence is associated with increased risk for
   schizophrenia. Despite within-normal-range premorbid IQ scores,
   apparently healthy adolescents who will later manifest schizophrenia
   nevertheless have intellectual decline.}},

Title = {{The effect of asbestosis on lung cancer risk beyond the dose related

Journal = {{OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{885-889}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aims: To determine if the presence of asbestosis is a prerequisite for
   lung cancer in subjects with known exposure to blue asbestos (
   crocidolite).
   Methods: Former workers and residents of Wittenoom with known amounts of
   asbestos exposure ( duration, intensity, and time since first exposure),
   current chest x ray and smoking information, participating in a cancer
   prevention programme ( n = 1988) were studied. The first plain chest
   radiograph taken at the time of recruitment into the cancer prevention
   programme was examined for radiographic evidence of asbestosis according
   to the UICC ( ILO) classification. Cox proportional hazards modelling
   was used to relate asbestosis, asbestos exposure, and lung cancer.
   Results: Between 1990 and 2002 there were 58 cases of lung cancer.
   Thirty six per cent of cases had radiographic evidence of asbestosis
   compared to 12\% of study participants. Smoking status was the strongest
   predictor of lung cancer, with current smokers ( OR = 26.5, 95\% CI 3.5
   to 198) having the greatest risk. Radiographic asbestosis ( OR = 1.94,
   95\% CI 1.09 to 3.46) and asbestos exposure ( OR = 1.21 per f/ml-year,
   95\% CI 1.02 to 1.42) were significantly associated with an increased
   risk of lung cancer. There was an increased risk of lung cancer with
   increasing exposure in those without asbestosis.
   Conclusion: In this cohort of former workers and residents of Wittenoom,
   asbestosis is not a mandatory precursor for asbestos related lung
   cancer. These findings support the hypothesis that it is the asbestos
   fibres per se that cause lung cancer, which can develop with or without
   the presence of asbestosis.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This analysis explores theories of recollective memories and their
   shortcomings to show how certain recollective memories are to some
   extent the initial experiencing of past conscious mental states. While
   dedicated memory theorists over the past century show remembering to be
   an active and subjective process, they usually make simplistic
   assumptions regarding the experience that is remembered. Their treatment
   of experience leaves unexplored the notion that the truth of memory is a
   dynamic interaction between experience and recollection. The argument's
   seven sections examine how experience, consciousness, and the self
   produce memories in odd but actual situations. Examples are presented
   that are either actual or technologically possible, and they pose a
   challenge for some theories of memory. Showing that an experience and a
   memory must be bound by psychological continuity, the sections build
   upon each other to challenge aprioristic beliefs about the self and
   consciousness. The later sections examine the lack of available accounts
   of memory that acknowledge consciousness, dissociation, and `'selfhood''
   to be matters of degree, thus rendering memory theories next to useless
   when trying to effectively incorporate the notions of experience and
   reality.}},

Abstract = {{The WHO recommends exclusive breast-feeding for the first 6 months of
   life. At present, < 2 \% of mothers who breast-feed in the UK do so
   exclusively for 6 months. We propose the testable hypothesis that this
   is because many mothers do not provide sufficient breast milk to feed a
   6-month-old baby adequately. We review recent evidence on energy
   requirements during infancy, and energy transfer from mother to baby,
   and consider the adequacy of exclusive breast-feeding to age 6 months
   for mothers and babies in the developed world. Evidence from our recent
   systematic review suggests that mean metabolisable energy intake in
   exclusively breast-fed infants at 6 months is 2 center dot 2-2 center
   dot 4 MJ/d (525-574 kcal/d), and mean energy requirement approximately 2
   center dot 6-2 center dot 7 MJ/d (632-649 kcal/d), leading to a gap
   between the energy provided by milk and energy needs by 6 months for
   many babies. Our hypothesis is consistent with other evidence, and with
   evolutionary considerations, and we briefly review this other evidence.
   The hypothesis would be testable in a longitudinal study of infant
   energy balance using stable-isotope techniques, which are both practical
   and valid.}},

Title = {{Electronic properties of interstitial iron and iron-boron pairs
   determined by means of advanced lifetime spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{As dissolved iron is one of the most common lifetime-killing
   contaminants in silicon, its coexisting defect configurations,
   interstitial iron (Fe-i) and iron-boron pairs (FeB), are investigated on
   an intentionally iron-contaminated silicon sample by means of
   temperature-dependent lifetime spectroscopy (TDLS) and
   injection-dependent lifetime spectroscopy (IDLS). In good agreement with
   the literature, the study identifies the known Fe-i donor level at
   E-t-E-V=(0.394 +/- 0.005)eV and determines its symmetry factor as
   k=sigma(n)/sigma(p)=51 +/- 5, which is an order of magnitude lower than
   expected from the literature. Using the well-confirmed k factor, the
   poorly confirmed electron-capture cross section is redetermined as
   sigma(n)=(3.6 +/- 0.4)x10(-15) cm(2) at 300 K. In addition, the observed
   exponential sigma(T) dependence identifies the multiphonon emission
   mechanism as the dominant capture mechanism for electrons with an
   activation energy E-infinity=0.024 eV. Concerning the defect related to
   the iron-boron pair, the study unambiguously identifies the deep FeB
   acceptor level as the dominant FeB recombination center. While the known
   average value E-C-E-t=(0.26 +/- 0.03)eV for the energy level is well
   confirmed, the symmetry factor is determined as k=0.45, which represents
   an intermediate value among the scattered results from the literature.
   Additional spectroscopic information from the defect transformation
   allows both capture cross sections of the FeB defect to be determined
   (sigma(n)=2.5x10(-15) cm(2) and sigma(p)=5.5x10(-15) cm(2)). Being
   suggested as a fingerprint of iron in the literature, the crossover
   position of the Fe-i- and FeB-dominated IDLS curves (at 300 K) is
   experimentally proved to be doping dependent which is accurately
   predicted on the basis of the extracted set of Fe-i and FeB defect
   parameters. An additional fingerprint of iron is found by the
   qualitative change of the TDLS curve upon illumination and its S-like
   shape under dark conditions, which represents a robust criterion for
   unambiguous identification of iron in silicon. As the most sensitive
   technique to detect and determine an iron contamination in silicon
   heavily relies on the Fe-i and FeB defect parameters, the spectroscopic
   results are of special practical importance. (c) 2005 American Institute

Abstract = {{In this paper, crucial aspects of the implications and the complexity of
   interconnected multi-pollutant multi-effect assessments of both air
   pollution control strategies and the closely related reduction of
   greenhouse gas emissions will be discussed. The main aims of the work
   described here are to identify the core problems which occur when trying
   to apply current state-of-the-art methodology to conduct integrated
   assessments - in this context, cost-benefit assessment (CBA) as well as
   cost-effectiveness assessment (CEA) using sophisticated computer models
   and propose solutions to the problems identified. The approaches
   described will display the integrated use of databases, efficient
   algorithms and already existing software tools and models in a unified
   model framework. The first part of the paper discusses the need for new
   developments in one particular field of Integrated Assessment Models
   (IAMs), which is the use of (typically) country-specific single
   pollutant abatement cost curves, which have been applied in a large
   number of modelling approaches with the aim to find cost-effective
   solutions for given air quality targets. However, research conducted to
   find such cost-effective solutions for the non-linear problem of
   tropospheric ozone abatement (dealing with two primary pollutants and
   their rather complex relationship to form tropospheric ozone, {[}see]
   {[}Friedrich, R., Reis, S. (Eds.), 2000. Tropospheric Ozone Abatement -
   Developing Efficient Strategies for the Reduction of Ozone Precursor
   Emissions in Europe. Springer Publishers] identified basic problems of
   cost curve based approaches even in this two-pollutant case. The
   approach discussed here promises to solve the key problems identified,
   making extensive use of databases in order to provide fast and high
   quality model input for CEA and CBA. In addition to that, the
   application of Genetic Algorithms will be discussed as a means to
   address extremely complex, vast solution spaces which are typical for

Abstract = {{Magnetoresistive biosensors use a new detection method for molecular
   recognition reactions based on two recently developed techniques and
   devices: Magnetic markers and XMR sensors, where XMR means either giant
   magnetoresistance (GMR) or tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR). The
   markers are specifically attached to the target molecules, and their
   magnetic stray field is picked up by an embedded magnetoresistive sensor
   as a change of the electrical resistance. Compared to established, e.g.,
   fluorescent, detection methods, magnetic biosensors have a number of
   advantages, including low molecular detection limits, flexibility, and
   the direct availability of an electronic signal suitable for further
   automated analysis. This makes them a promising choice for the detection
   units of future widespread and easy-to-use lab-on-a-chip systems or
   biochips. In this article, we discuss recent advances in this field and
   compare possible approaches toward single molecule detection.}},

   dynamic loading?}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1126-1130}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. Maintenance of wire pretension in an Ilizarov external
   fixator is dependent on the torque applied to the fixation bolts. We
   therefore measured immediately after surgery the clinically applied
   torques. The median value was only 10 N in (range 8-14 N in). We
   wondered whether this value is appropriate to maintain the wire
   pretension and thereby to achieve sufficient fracture stability during
   dynamic loading of the device for a longer period.
   Methods. A material testing machine dynamically loaded one wire mounted
   on one ring. Several configurations were tested.
   Results. A quick decrease in wire tension to a steady state situation
   was seen. In the most stable configuration (20 N in wire fixation
   torque) 50\% of the initial 90 kg wire pretension remained after dynamic
   loading with 200 N. In the least stable configuration (10 N in torque)
   considerable wire slippage occurred even without loading and no tension
   remained after loading!
   No plastic deformation of the wires was observed so loss of wire tension
   was due to slippage of the wires through the fixation bolts.
   Interpretation. With the small fixation torques used in clinical
   practice considerable wire tension is lost even after a few loading
   cycles. Further research should address the question whether
   preservation of a higher wire tension during long term loading promotes
   faster fracture healing. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chemokines direct the migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation
   and are potential targets for anti-inflammatory therapy. Chronic
   proliferative dermatitis (cpdm/cpdm) mutant mice develop a persistent
   eosinophilic dermatitis associated with increased T(H)2 cytokines in the
   skin. Expression patterns of chemokines in the skin of cpdm/cpdm mice
   were evaluated to define the mechanisms driving cutaneous infiltration
   by leukocytes. RNA isolated from the skin of mutant and littermate
   control mice revealed a significant increase in Ccl1 (TCA-3), Ccl2
   (MCP-1), Ccl11 (eotaxin), Ccl17 (TARC), Cxcl10 (IP-10), and the
   chemokine receptor Ccr3. The concentration of CCL11 protein was
   increased two- to threefold in the skin of cpdm/cpdm mice by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In vitro culture of primary dermal
   fibroblasts from cpdm/cpdm and control mice with tumor necrosis factor,
   IL-4, and IL-13 stimulation did not reveal differences in their ability
   to secrete CCL11, suggesting that the increased chemokine expression
   observed in the skin of cpdm/cpdm mice is most likely caused by the
   increased T(H)2 cytokines in the dermis of this mouse model. Treatment
   of cpdm/cpdm mice with CCL11-neutralizing polyclonal antibodies did not
   affect the number of eosinophils in the skin or the severity of the
   dermatitis. Neutralizing multiple chemokines or chemokine receptors may
   be necessary to decrease eosinophil accumulation. The cpdm/cpdm mutant
   mouse is a potentially useful model to determine the role of various
   chemokines in eosinophil accumulation in chronic inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have documented a relatively high rate of disagreement
   for interdepartmental consultations, but follow-up is limited. We
   reviewed the results of 3 types of interdepartmental consultations in
   out-hospital during a 2-year period, including 328 incoming, 928
   pathologist-generated outgoing, and 22 7 patient- or clinician-generated
   outgoing consults. The disagreement rate was significantly higher for
   incoming consults (10.7\%) than for outgoing pathologist-generated
   consults (5.9\%) (P =.06). Disagreement rates for outgoing patient- or
   clinician-generated consults were not significantly different from
   either other type (7.9\%). Additional consultation, biopsy, or testing
   follow-up was available for 19 (54\%) of 35, 14 (25\%) of 55, and 6
   (33\%) of 18 incoming, outgoing pathologist-generated, and outgoing
   patient or clinician-generated consults with disagreements,
   respectively; the percentage of errors varied widely (15/19 {[}79\%],
   8/14 {[}57\%], and 2/6 {[}33\%], respectively), but differences were not
   significant (P > .05 for each). Review of the individual errors revealed
   specific diagnostic areas in which improvement in performance might be
   made. Disagreement rates for interdepartmental consultation ranged from
   5.9\% to 10.7\%, but only 33\% to 79\% represented errors. Additional
   consultation, tissue, and testing results can aid in distinguishing
   disagreements from errors.}},

Abstract = {{This work explores the potential of solid sampling-graphite furnace
   atomic absorption spectrometry for the direct determination of Hg in

   fast and reliable determination of Hg in seven different soil certified
   reference materials. The main features of this method are: a detection
   limit of 25 ng g (1), RSD values between 3 and 12\% and straightforward
   calibration with aqueous standards, Furthermore. the paper discusses in
   detail how to transform this quantitative method into a screening
   method. intended for those situations in which only a binary response
   (Yes, No) is required (e.g. routine control of, agricultural soils it)
   the European Community. for which a legal limit of 1.5 mu g g (1) Hg has

Abstract = {{Purpose: Modifications to the amount and type of fat in the diet are
   recommended as strategies to help reduce heart disease risk. Individuals
   can choose from a variety of margarines and oils to alter their intakes
   of different types of fats, and nutrient content claims on product
   labels (e.g., `low in saturated fat') can help them quickly identify
   healthful products. However, margarines and oils vary in price.
   Methods: To examine the relationship between the price and amounts of
   saturated and trans fats in margarines and oils, and the relationship
   between price and the presence of nutrient content claims, price and
   label information were recorded for margarines (n=229) and oils (n=342)
   sold in the major supermarkets within the Greater Toronto Area.
   Results: Linear regression analysis revealed a negative relationship
   between the price and amounts of saturated fat and trans fats in
   margarines, but not in oils. Margarines with a nutrient content claim
   were significantly more expensive than were those without a claim.
   Conclusions: The findings for margarines are of particular concern for
   lower income groups for whom budgetary constraints result in the
   purchase of lower priced foods, and also raise important questions about
   the usefulness of nutrient content claims in guiding food selections.}},

   years) with stress incontinence participating in a randomized surgical
   trial. Severity of incontinence was defined by the mean number of
   incontinence episodes per day recorded in a 3-day bladder diary. The
   relationships between severity and several baseline variables were
   examined, including demographics, medical, obstetric, and gynecologic
   history, body mass index, smoking status, Q-tip displacement, and Pelvic
   Organ Prolapse Quantification stage (POP-Q).
   Results: In a multivariable model, severity of incontinence was
   positively associated with body mass index (P = .0003) and current
   smoking (P = .01), and negatively associated with prolapse stage (P <
   .0001) and Q-tip displacement (P = .042).
   Conclusion: Incontinence severity in a surgical population was
   independently associated with 2 modifiable factors, obesity and tobacco
   use, as well as pelvic support. (c) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A set of 3 new synthetic uranium isotope mixtures with U-236/U-238
   isotope ratios in the order of 10(-6), 10(-7) and 10(-8) has been
   produced and certified for the isotopic composition. For the preparation
   of these 3 mixtures a natural uranium starting material ( U-235/U-238 =
   0.007 25) is mixed in 3 different proportions with a non-natural
   starting material, which is made up of a 1 : 1 mixture of IRMM-187
   (U-235/U-238 = 0.0475) with a material highly enriched in U-235. The
   U-236/U-238 ratios of the 3 mixtures are calculated using the measured
   U-236/U-238 ratios of the natural (close to detection limit) and the
   non-natural starting materials. The U-236 isotope intensity of the
   latter material was measured on a Faraday collector. The minor isotope
   abundances of the 3 mixtures were calculated from the minor isotope
   abundances of the starting materials and the measured U-235/U-238 ratios
   of the mixtures. Direct measurements of the U-236/U-238 ratios for all 3
   mixtures were performed by TIMS using a secondary electron multiplier
   operated in ion counting mode for the U-236 ion beam. The results agree
   well with the ratios obtained from the mixing calculations. This
   confirmation is considered a proof for the reliability of our TIMS
   procedure used to measure U-236/U-238 ratios within a wide dynamic
   range. Based on the confidence provided by the synthetic uranium isotope
   mixtures, the minor isotope ratios U-234/U-238 and U-236/U-238 were
   re-measured and re-certified by TIMS for the reference materials
   IRMM-183-187. On the new certificates for IRMM-183-187 the minor ratios
   U-234/ U-238 and U-236/U-238 are certified with a circa ten-times lower
   uncertainty compared to previous values.}},

Abstract = {{Anaphes iole Girault (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) is a solitary egg
   parasitoid of Lygus bugs (Heteroptera: Miridae) in North America.
   Circumstantial evidence suggests that A. iole females are strictly
   proovigenic. This study was designed to determine if honey-fed A. iole
   females could in fact mature additional eggs if exposed to hosts for a
   few days then removed from hosts and held at 25 degrees C for 0, 3, or 6
   days. Contrary to expectation, honey-fed A. iole females matured
   considerably more eggs when deprived of hosts for 3 or 6 days rather
   than 0 days. This research suggests that A. iole females are not
   strictly proovigenic. However, they do have proovigenic tendencies,
   since most females emerge with at least 71\% of their potential
   fecundity.}},

Abstract = {{Both vertically and horizontally installed heat source systems for
   ground-coupled heat pumps based on the thermosyphon principle using CO2
   as the working fluid have been investigated theoretically as well as
   experimentally.
   The investigation of the vertical type (CO2 probe) has started in 1997.
   During the last years various design and operational parameters have
   been analyzed in depth, e.g. optimum number of parallel earth probes,
   probe length, CO2 charge required etc. In Austria up to now more than
   100 systems have been installed, and the experience confirms that a heat
   pump system consisting of heat pump, probe head, and CO2 probe is a
   reliable, highly efficient as well as environmentally friendly
   alternative to commonly used ground-coupled systems.
   The great success with the CO2 probe initiated further research
   activities on a horizontal type (CO2 collector). The first experimental
   results carried out with a test rig in the laboratory confirm that CO2
   can be used as heat carrier in collectors. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{Minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs) constitute the targets of the
   graft-versus-leukemia response after HLA-identical allogeneic stem cell
   transplantation. Here, we have used genetic linkage analysis to identify
   a novel mHAg, designated lymphoid-restricted histocompatibility
   antigen-1 (LRH-1), which is encoded by the P2X5 gene and elicited an
   allogeneic CTL response in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia after
   donor lymphocyte infusion. We demonstrate that immunogenicity for LRH-1
   is clue to differential protein expression in recipient and donor cells
   as a consequence of a homozygous frameshift polymorphism in the donor.
   Tetramer analysis showed that emergence of LRH-1-specific CD8(+)
   cytotoxic T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow correlated with
   complete remission of chronic myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, the
   restricted expression of LRH-1 in hematopoietic cells including leukemic
   CD34(+) progenitor cells provides evidence of a role for LRH-1-specific
   CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in selective graft-versus-leukemia reactivity in
   the absence of severe graft-versus-host disease. These findings
   illustrate that the P2X5-encoded mHAg LRH-1 could be an attractive
   target for specific immunotherapy to treat hematological malignancies
   recurring after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Poplars and willows can accumulate high concentrations of some trace
   elements. We investigated the extent and nature of B, Cd, Col Cu, Fe,
   Mn, and Zn accumulation in some commercial poplar and willow clones by
   using a lysimeter experiment and field collection of data. Trace element
   accumulation was a function of leaf age and the variety or species of
   tree. Leaf B, Cd, Mn, and Zn concentrations increased throughout the
   season, while Cu decreased and Fe remained unchanged. Poplars and
   willows accumulated high concentrations of the trace elements tested,
   relative to pasture. The accumulation of Cd is of concern, especially in
   willows. Stock exposure to Cd can be managed by judicious clone
   selection, harvesting young shoots, or harvesting early in the season.
   Poplars and willows may be used as feed supplements to increase Co and
   Zn intake by livestock. The varieties `Yeogi' and `Crow's Nest'
   accumulated the highest concentrations of Co, yet their Cd
   concentrations were not significantly higher than pasture.}},

Abstract = {{There is now a growing interest in new approaches to examine the
   construction and significance of Western frontier landscapes. This paper
   adds to this new scholarship by examining how labour relations
   associated with buffalo bunting in Australia's North were also race
   relations which became embedded in,the production and representations of
   this landscape as a feral region of the outback frontier. Drawing on a
   range of archival, secondary and oral sources, the paper outlines the
   myriad of human-buffalo and cross-cultural interactions that revolved
   around the shooting of buffalo within an erratic industry between the
   early 1890s and the mid-1950s. The analysis emphasizes that insecure
   efforts of officials and settlers to authorize, re-work or bide buffalo
   bunting interactions were linked with a wider debate on the type of
   people and animals who could colonize this region. It is from these
   `feral' landscapes and histories, the paper argues, where a multiple of
   definitions and significance of frontier experiences can be found.}},

Abstract = {{Fetal growth impairment can occur in pregnancy complicated by diabetes.
   Although several studies have focused the effects of nutritional status
   on intrauterine development, the long-term impact of maternal diabetes
   on vascular and renal function in the offspring is poorly investigated.
   In the present study, blood pressure profiles and renal function
   parameters were investigated in the offspring of diabetic rats (DO).
   Female rats were made diabetic throughout gestation with a single dose
   of streptozotocyn (STZ) 10 d before mating. After weaning, the offspring
   had free access to food and water. Arterial pressure was evaluated every
   15 d. Functional and morphometric kidney studies were performed in
   newborn, 3, 6 and 12-mo-old male rats in DO and in controls, C. Although
   maternal diabetes did not affect nephron number in the young adult rat,
   glomerular hypertrophy developed from 3 mo on. Glomerular Filtration
   Rate and Renal Plasma Flow were observed to be significantly decreased
   in DO when compared with C, from 3 mo on. In DO, hypertension was
   observed from 8 wk on and persisted elevated throughout the experimental
   period (12 mo). Vascular reactivity, evaluated in mesenteric arterial
   bed showed a decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in 12-mo-old
   DO animals, while preserved response to sodium nitroprusside was
   demonstrated. Our data show that exposure to intrauterine diabetes
   induced by STZ does not affect nephron number in the young offspring but
   can cause permanent changes in Nitric Oxide (NO)-related vascular
   response, which, in turn may accelerate the natural age-related nephron
   loss.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in motor and psychologic variables according to playing
   positions were analyzed in a sample of 53 elite female handball players,
   members of junior and senior national team. Motor status included 8
   variables for assessment of explosive strength of landing and throwing,
   agility, speed strength, movement frequency, and flexibility.
   Psychologic status was analyzed through 4 dimensions according to
   Eysenck: extroversion, psychotic behavior, neurotic behavior, and lie.
   The anthropologic features analyzed showed statistically significant
   differences. Considering motor abilities, differences were recorded in
   the variables for assessment of speed strength, agility and leg movement
   frequency, where wings predominated, whereas goalkeepers showed
   predominance in flexibility. In psychologic status, differeces were
   present in the variable for assessment of extroversion, which was most
   pronounced in wings, whereas psychotic behavior was more expressed in
   those at pivot position. The differences were primarily consequential to
   the selection of players of a specific anthropologic profile for
   particular playing positions. The hypothesis of the impact of
   kinesiologic specificities of a particular playing position on the
   formation of the players' anthropologic profile should be scientifically
   tested. Study results may found application in training and contest
   practice, especially in forming anthropologic models for particular
   positions during the process of player selection.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Mitomycin C (MMC) is used in otolaryngological surgery to
   reduce complications from postoperative scarring. However, the effects
   of MMC on wound healing at different doses and on different wound types
   have not been fully described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   effects of topical MMC at 2 different doses on the healing of surgical
   and laser wounds.
   STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a randomized study using 20 rabbits.
   Six full-thickness wounds were made by excision or laser vaporization on
   the flank skin. The wounds were randomly treated by topical MMC of 0.4
   or 1.0 mg/mL or saline for 5 minutes.
   RESULTS: Re-epithelialization and contraction of the original wounds
   were significantly delayed by the use of MMC (P < 0.01). The delayed
   healing effect of MMC was more prominent in the laser wounds than in the
   excision wounds. MMC inhibited collagen deposition and fibroblast
   proliferation of wounds on histological analysis. The 2 different
   concentrations of MMC showed no difference in gross or histological
   wound healing characteristics.
   CONCLUSION: Our results showed that MMC delays the healing of wounds as
   a result of the inhibition of fibrosis, especially for laser wounds. (C)

Abstract = {{A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the effect of
   neosporosis on productive and reproductive parameters in dairy cows.
   Cows (n = 2743) from 94 farms located in the most important dairy areas
   in Costa Rica were used in the study. The size of the herds ranged from
   32 to 379 females (mean = 110, median = 125). An indirect ELISA was used
   to determine the serostatus of the cows towards Neospora caninum. The
   effect of neosporosis on milk production was analysed by a mixed linear
   model. In addition, the effects on calving interval (days) and calving
   to conception interval (days) were analysed by survival analysis. The
   risk of abortion in relation to N. caninum serostatus was assessed by
   logistic regression, with herd as a random effect. Overall, 1185 of 2743
   cows (43.3\%) were seropositive for Neospora. Eighty-nine of 94 (94.7\%)
   farms were classified as Neosporaseropositive. It was estimated that
   cows seronegative to Neospora produced an additional 84.7 L of milk (P =
   0.6). Serostatus did not have a significant effect on the length of the
   calving interval in the Cox proportional hazard survival analysis
   (Hazard ratio = 1.2, 95\% CI: 0.9, 1.4). The logistic regression model
   had a weak positive association between serostatus and abortion (OR 1.7,
   95\% CI: 0.8, 3.9), but did not show a strong association between
   serostatus and the number of services per conception (OR = 0.95, 95\%
   CI: 0.7, 1.3). In conclusion, there were no significant effects of
   Neospora serostatus on production and reproductive performance in this
   study. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Renal transplant recipients are at increased risk for development of

   determine whether there had been an improvement in compliance over the
   last 6 years. Two hundred twenty-seven patients were invited to complete
   the questionnaire used in the previous study. This questionnaire was
   designed to establish whether patients understood the need for extra
   care, whether they recalled any education about protective measures, and
   what actual measures were taken. There was a significant increase in the
   proportion of patients taking appropriate precautions. Hence there has
   been a significant improvement in the compliance of renal transplant
   recipients in Yorkshire with skin protection measures since this was

Abstract = {{Phospholipase D (PLD) is a PtdCho-hydrolyzing enzyme that plays central
   signaling functions in eukaryotic cells. We previously demonstrated that
   action of a set of four nonclassical and membrane-associated Sec14p-like
   phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) is required for optimal
   activation of yeast PLD in vegetative cells. Herein, we focus on
   mechanisms of Sfh2p and Sfh5p function in this regulatory circuit. We
   describe several independent lines of in vivo evidence to indicate these
   SFH PITPs regulate PLD by stimulating PtdIns-4,5-P-2 synthesis and that
   this stimulated PtdIns-4,5-P-2 synthesis couples to action of the Stt4p
   PtdIns 4-kinase. Furthermore, we provide genetic evidence to suggest
   that specific subunits of the yeast exocyst complex (i.e. a component of
   the plasma membrane vesicle docking machinery) and the Sec9p plasma
   membrane t-SNARE are regulated by PtdIns(4,5)P-2 and that Sfh5p helps
   regulate this interface in vivo. The collective in vivo and biochemical
   data suggest SFH-mediated stimulation of Stt4p activity is indirect,
   most likely via a substrate delivery mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports on a high precision equipment designed to modify over
   3-dimensions (3D) by means of high-energy heavy ions the local
   properties of thin and thick films. A target-moving system aimed at
   creating patterns across the volume is driven by an x-y writing protocol
   that allows one to modify beam sensitive samples over micrometer-size
   regions of whatever shape. The moving system has a mechanical resolution
   of 15 nm. The issue of the local fluence measurement has been
   particularly addressed. The setup has been checked by means of different
   geometries patterned on beam sensitive sheets as well as on
   superconducting materials. In the last case the 3D modification consists
   of amorphous nanostructures. The nanostructures create zones with
   different dissipative properties with respect to the virgin regions. The
   main analysis method consists of magneto-optical imaging that provides
   local information on the electrodynamics of the modified zones. Features
   typical of non-linear current flow hint at which pattern geometry is
   more functional to applications in the framework of confined
   nanostructuring of superconducting films. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The parasitic protozoan Giardia lamblia is a worldwide cause of
   diarrhea, but the mechanism of disease remains elusive. The parasite
   colonizes the small intestinal epithelium, known to be a sensor for the
   presence of enteric pathogens, without invading or causing severe
   inflammation. In this study we investigated the epithelial cell response
   to G. lamblia. Differentiated Caco-2 cells were infected with G. lamblia
   isolate WB-A11, and the transcriptome of the intestinal cells was
   analyzed after 1.5, 6, and 18 h of interaction, using oligonucleotide
   microarrays. A large number of genes displayed changed expression
   patterns, showing the complexity of the interaction between G. lamblia
   and intestinal cells. A novel chemokine profile (CCL2, CCL20, CXCL1,
   CXCL2, and CXCL3) was induced that was different from the response

Abstract = {{This paper deals with families of conformal iterated function systems
   (CIFS). The space of all CIFS, with common seed space X and alphabet I,
   is successively endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence and a
   new, weaker topology called lambda-topology. It is proved that the
   pressure and the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set are continuous
   with respect to the topology of pointwise convergence when I is finite,
   and are lower semicontinuous, though generally not continuous, when I is
   infinite. It is then shown that these two functions are, in any case,
   continuous in the X-topology. The concepts of analytic, regularly
   analytic and plane-analytic families of CIFS are also introduced. It is
   established that if a family of CIFS is regularly analytic, then the
   Hausdorff dimension function is real-analytic; if a family is
   plane-analytic, then the Hausdorff dimension function is continuous and
   subharmonic, though not necessarily real-analytic. These results are
   then applied to finite parabolic CIFS. Counter-examples highlighting
   breakdowns of real-analyticity in the Hausdorff dimension among
   analytic, but not regularly analytic, families are further provided.
   Such families often exhibit a phenomenon known as phase transition.
   Sufficient conditions preventing the occurrence of such transitions are
   supplemented.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the development of short contact time (SCT) reactor
   design approaches allow reformers capable of overcoming current barriers
   of cost, size, weight, complexity and efficiency associated with
   conventional reactor design approaches. PCI has developed an SCT based
   approach using a patented substrate (trademarked Microlith (R)) and
   proprietary coating technology {[}1]. The high heat and mass transport
   properties of the substrate have been shown to significantly reduce
   reactor size while improving performance. Resistance to coking,
   especially at low H2O:C ratios, has also been observed with these
   reactors.
   This paper summarizes the results of auto thermal reforming (ATR) of an
   iso-octane-based liquid fuel. In addition Microlith-based water gas
   shift (WGS) and preferential CO oxidation (PROX) reactors were also
   examined for fuel processing applications. Surprisingly, selectivity
   advantages for these kinetically controlled reactions were observed
   {[}2]. Examples described here include low methanation selectivity in
   WGS applications and large operating windows for PROX at very high space
   velocities. A complete reformer system with Microlith ATR, WGS and PROX
   reactors has been identified. Sensitivity of system size with regard to
   steam:carbon ratios, and the resulting implications for reactor/heat
   exchanger sizes were documented and a compact system identified. (c)

Abstract = {{Is Artic char in lake Geneva endangered by Bacterial Kidney Disease? -
   The catch of Arctic char in Lake Geneva experienced a remarkable
   decrease since 1998, even though the fishing legislation did not change
   and the stocking efforts remained at the same level. It is hypothesized
   that Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD) may at least partly be involved in
   this phenomenon by inducing increased mortality rates. In the laboratory
   the presence of BKD can be detected successfully by immunohistologal
   techniques. Investigations demonstrated the disease to be present in
   Lake Geneva, although at a very low level (0. 6\% of the 331 fish
   observed in 2004 and 0\% of the 142 fish observed in 2005) The disease
   by itself can thus not explain the decrease observed in the catch of
   Arctic char in Lake Geneva.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have suggested that older adults may be more resistant
   to muscular fatigue than young adults. We sought to determine whether
   motor unit firing rate might be a factor that determines the response to
   fatiguing exercise in young and older subjects. Motor unit recordings
   and muscular forces were obtained from the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle
   of 11 young and 8 older individuals. Maximal voluntary force was first
   measured during maximal-effort dorsiflexion contractions. Each subject
   then performed a series of 15 maximal isometric contractions, with each
   contraction lasting 30 s. A 10-s rest period separated the fatiguing
   contractions. As a result of the fatiguing exercise, both subject groups
   demonstrated a significant loss in maximal force. The force decline was
   less in the older adults (20.4\%) than in the young adults (33.8\%). As
   expected, prior to muscle fatigue, maximal firing rates in the TA muscle
   were greater in the young (28.1 +/- 5.8 imp/s) than in the older adults
   (22.3 +/- 4.8 imp/s). The decrease in motor unit firing rate with
   fatigue was also greater in the young adults (34.9\%), than in the older
   adults (22.0\%). These results suggest that the greater
   fatigue-resistance exhibited by older individuals might be explained by
   the fact that the decline in motor unit firing rate during fatigue is
   greater in young persons than it is in older adults. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: One of the first proteins synthesized by a conceptus is HCG.
   The receptor-binding beta-subunit of HCG (HCG beta) is encoded by highly
   homologous CGB, CGB5, CGB7 and CGB8 genes. The function of two
   additional gene copies, CGB1 and CGB2, is still unknown. We aimed to
   compare the expression of individual CGB genes during normal pregnancy
   and in cases of recurrent miscarriage (RM) and ectopic pregnancy (EP).
   METHODS: A semiquantitative RT-PCR with fluorescent-labelled primers
   coupled with the gene-specific restriction and quantification was used.
   RESULTS: The summarized expression of HCG beta genes was high throughout
   the pregnancy, and moderately correlated with HCG in serum. In cases of
   RM, reduced hormone values were consistent with low mRNA levels, whereas
   for EP no reduction in transcriptional activity was detected. CGB1and
   CGB2 showed a considerable expression peak during the first trimester,
   both in normal and ectopic pregnancy, but not for RM. CONCLUSIONS: In
   cases of RM, low HCG could result from expression failure of HCG beta
   genes, whereas in EP the problems other than the transcriptional failure
   contribute to reduced hormone levels. The expression patterns of CGB1
   and CGB2 suggest their putative role in the implantation stage.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygenated amorphous carbon nitride thin films (a-CNxOy) were deposited
   by pulsed laser deposition of camphoric carbon (CC) target at various
   substrate temperatures (ST). The influence of ST on the bonding
   properties of a-CNxOy films was investigated. The nitrogen to carbon
   (N/C) atomic ratio and oxygen to carbon (O/C) atomic ratio, bonding
   state and microstructure of the deposited a-CNxOy films were
   characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and been
   confirmed using standard measurement techniques. The bonding states
   between the C and N, and C and O in the deposited films are found
   significantly influenced by the ST. during deposition process. The N/C
   and O/C atomic ratio of the a-CNxOy films reached the maximum value at
   400 degrees C. The XPS C 1s shows the bonding state of a-CNxOy films
   changes from diamond-like tetrahedral (sp(3)) carbon and carbon (C-C)
   bonding to graphite-like trihedral (sp(2)) C = C bonding with the
   increase of ST. While, the XPS N 1s shows the sp(3) C-N bonds increases
   with higher rates compared with sp(2) C = N bonds up to 400 degrees C,
   after which it decreases with higher ST. The C-N bonding of C-N, C = N
   and C = N were observed in the deposited a-CNxOy films. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Members of several bacterial lineages are known only as symbionts of
   insects and move among hosts through maternal transmission. Such
   vertical transfer promotes strong fidelity within these associations,
   favoring the evolution of microbially mediated effects that improve host
   fitness. However, phylogenetic evidence indicates occasional horizontal
   transfer among different insect species, suggesting that some microbial
   symbionts retain a generalized ability to infect multiple hosts. Here we
   examine the abilities of three vertically transmitted bacteria from the
   Gammaproteobacteria to infect and spread within a novel host species,
   the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Using microinjection, we transferred
   symbionts from three species of natural aphid hosts into a common host
   background, comparing transmission efficiencies between novel symbionts
   and those naturally infecting A. pisum. We also examined the fitness
   effects of two novel symbionts to determine whether they should persist
   under natural selection acting at the host level. Our results reveal
   that these heritable bacteria vary in their capacities to utilize A.
   pisum as a host. One of three novel symbionts failed to undergo
   efficient maternal transmission in A. pisum, and one of the two
   efficiently transmitted bacteria depressed aphid growth rates. Although
   these findings reveal that negative fitness effects and low transmission
   efficiency can prevent the establishment of a new infection following
   horizontal transmission, they also indicate that some symbionts can
   overcome these obstacles, accounting for their widespread distributions
   across aphids and related insects.}},

Abstract = {{There appears to be substantial convergence in the type and extent of
   telecommunications networks being deployed between and in major European
   cities to serve increasing numbers of corporate clients, thus forming
   one of the principal material elements in the development of a world
   city network. Through a broad theoretical discussion and an empirical
   exploration of the interurban and intraurban network development of one
   of the major telecommunications providers in Europe, however, it is
   shown how the planning, construction and expansion of these
   infrastructures remain crucially shaped by a variety of historical,
   regulatory, economic, physical and organisational constraints and
   compulsions which are specific to individual cities. It is argued that
   the mutually constitutive nature of economic and technological
   connectivities suggests, therefore, that the development of a world city
   network continues to have an important dimension of territorial fixity,
   reflecting the multiscalar entanglement of territory and globalisation
   that forms the world cities of today.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that conflicting demands over international
   rivers will intensify. There is an active debate on whether this will
   lead to ``water wars{''} or to unprecedented cooperation. Framing the
   debate in this manner, however tends to cast the concept of cooperation
   as all-or-nothing, implying that ``cooperation{''} is an extreme, in
   direct opposition to ``war{''} This conceptual construct obscures the
   many practical levels of cooperation that states can undertake to their
   mutual advantage. It is important to recognize that it is entirely
   rational that states will always have a ``national agenda{''} for a
   river that they share with other states, and that they will cooperate if
   it serves that national agenda. In practice, there can be a continuum of
   levels of cooperation, from simple information sharing, to joint
   ownership and management of infrastructure investments. Furthermore, it
   may not necessarily be the case that ``more{''} cooperation reaps
   ``more{''} benefits in all river basins. There are many different types
   of benefits that can be secured through the cooperative management of
   international waters, with each individual basin offering different
   potential cooperative benefits with different associated costs. For each
   international basin, the optimal mode of cooperation will depend on a
   mix of factors including hydrologic characteristics, the economics of
   cooperative investments, numbers and the relationships of riparians, and
   the costs of parties coming together.}},

Abstract = {{In a study on abortion attitudes, attributional and symbolic politics
   approaches were used to develop a model relating symbolic
   predispositions, perceptions of responsibility for unwanted pregnancy,
   affects, and attitudes toward abortion in samples from Japan and the
   United States. College students rated 6 causes of unwanted pregnancy on
   importance, controllability, responsibility, blame, sympathy, anger,
   judgments in favor of abortion, and likelihood of helping personally or
   through government assistance. Symbolic predispositions of religiosity,
   conservatism, moral traditionalism, and gender-role attitudes were also
   measured. Path analyses revealed that judgments in favor of abortion and
   helping were determined by a combination of attributional variables and
   symbolic predispositions in both samples. However, symbolic
   predispositions are weaker and the attributional variables are stronger
   determinants of attitudes in the Japanese sample as compared to the
   sample from the United States.}},

Abstract = {{In immediate serial recall, high-frequency words are better recalled
   than low-frequency words. Recently, it has been suggested that
   high-frequency words are better recalled because of their better
   long-term associative links, and not because of the intrinsic properties
   of their long-term representations. In the experiment reported here,
   recall performance was compared for pure lists of high- and
   low-frequency words, and for mixed lists composed of either one low- and
   five high-frequency words or the reverse. The usual advantage of
   high-frequency words was found with pure lists and this advantage was
   reduced, but still significant with mixed lists composed of five
   low-frequency words. However, the low-frequency word included in a
   high-frequency list was recalled just as well as high-frequency words.
   Results are challenging for the associative link hypothesis and are best
   interpreted within an item-based reconstruction hypothesis, along with a
   distinctiveness account.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS}},
Year = {{2005}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To retrospectively investigate elevation of serum potassium
   when spironolactone (25 or 50 mg/day) and furosemide were administered
   concomitantly with an angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I)
   or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) to patients with chronic heart
   failure for 12 months and occurrence of hyperkalemia and hypokalemia
   because of concomitant administration of spironolactone plus an ACE-I or
   ARB and furosemide.
   Methods: Patients with chronic heart failure, who visited departments of
   cardiovascular internal medicine and cardiovascular surgery at the
   National Hospital Organization Osaka Medical Center, were enrolled for
   this study. Serum potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum
   creatinine, uric acid, and serum sodium were determined in every patient
   at the time of start of treatment and at 3 and 12 months of treatment.
   Data from patients in Groups A (25 mg/day spironolactone + 40 mg/ day
   furosemide + an ACE-I or ARB) and B (50 mg/ day spironolactone + 40
   mg/day furosemide + an ACE-I or ARB) were analysed for differences with
   respect to the ACE-I and ARB used.
   Results: When 50 mg/day spironolactone plus 5 mg/day enalapril maleate
   (enalapril) or 50 mg/ day losartan potassium (losartan) or 8 mg/day
   candesartan cilexetil (candesartan) plus 40 mg/ day furosemide were
   concomitantly used, the mean value of serum potassium was significantly
   elevated only in the group treated with 50 mg/day spironolactone
   regardless of the concomitant drug. The number of patients with
   hyperkalemia (>5.5 mEq/L) at 12 months of treatment was 12 (8.8\%),
   while the number of patients with hypokalemia (<= 3.5 mEq/L) was 7
   (5.1\%). However, the occurrence of hyperkalemia was almost the same
   regardless of the dose of spironolactone or the ACE-I or ARB
   concomitantly administered. Therefore, if enalapril, losartan, or
   candesartan is concomitantly used, it is necessary to monitor the serum
   concentration of potassium, even if spironolactone is administered at a
   dose of 25 mg/day.
   Conclusion: The occurrence of hyperkalemia in patients administered
   spironolactone is influenced by the dose, but when it is used
   concomitantly with enalapril, losartan or candesartan, the occurrence of
   hyperkalemia exceeding 5.5 mEq/L may increase even if the dose of
   spironolactone is as low as 25 mg. Thus it is essential to always
   monitor serum potassium.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study aimed to evaluate microhardness and chemical
   analysis of carious and caries-affected dentine. The hypothesis tested
   was that calcium:phosphorous (Ca:P) ratios correlate with microhardness
   values.
   Methods: Four carious human third molars were sectioned through the
   caries lesion in the mesiodistal longitudinal plane. One half of each
   lesion underwent carious dentine removal using Carisolv(TM) gel. The cut
   surfaces were polished, microhardness tested using an
   Ultra-Micro-Indentation System (UMIS) and elemental analysis performed
   using energy dispersive analysis of x-rays (EDAX).
   Results: The microhardness of carious dentine decreased gradually
   towards the cavity floor, but that for caries-affected dentine showed
   more variation with depth, having a mean hardness of (0.63 +/- 0.18)
   GPa. Ca:P ratios of carious dentine varied among the four specimens. The
   mean Ca:P ratio of caries-affected dentine was 1:2.03 +/- 0.08. The
   hypothesis was accepted for active lesions.
   Conclusions: The use of Carisolv(TM) to excavate carious tissue can be
   as effective as rotary instrumentation.}},

Abstract = {{Recently a mechanism was proposed whereby the primordial density
   perturbations are generated at the end of inflation. We continue the
   analysis of the proposed model of this mechanism and calculate the
   maximum extent to which the density perturbations produced via this
   model can dominate over those of the standard inflationary paradigm. In
   addition, we provide a straightforward variation of this model which
   allows for greater amplification of the density perturbations. Finally,
   we show that a variation in the implementation of the original model
   results in significant non-Gaussianities in the resulting spectrum of
   density perturbations. The level of non-Gaussianities can be made to
   saturate the current observational bound.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To develop and evaluate the feasibility of Z-score
   distribution-based quality assessment for fetal biometry at 20-24
   gestational weeks.
   Methods Four sonographers measured fetal biparietal diameter, head
   circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length in unselected
   pregnancies undergoing routine sonography at 20-24 weeks in our center
   between June 2001 and January 2004. All measurements were transformed
   into Z-scores. Distributions of Z-scores were compared with the expected
   standard normal distribution based on mean, SD and the
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Modelling was performed to assess the
   sensitivity, specificity and Youden's index (sensitivity + specificity
   1) of each sonographer, reflecting their ability to detect fetuses with
   abnormal biometry in our population.
   Results A total of 5241 ultrasound examinations were included. None of
   the Z-score distributions could be considered similar to the standard
   normal distribution: means of Z-scores ranged from -0.604 to 0.73 and
   the SD ranged from 0.726 to 0.896. Sensitivity and specificity ranged
   from 25.31\% to 68.67\% and 93.44\% to 100\%, respectively; Youden's
   index ranged from 0.25 to 0.69.
   Conclusion Analysis of Z-score distribution can be used to assess the
   quality of fetal measurements. Several indices can be extracted from
   this analysis in order to improve quality assessment of fetal biometry

Abstract = {{Novel devices based on organic semiconductors such as organic light
   emitting diodes or organic field effect transistors require metallic
   contacts. Therefore, the interface between metals and organic
   semiconductors deserves special attention. In situ Raman scattering was
   applied here to assess metal/organic interface formation. As model
   systems molecular layers of two perylene derivatives, viz.
   3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) and NNdimethyl
   3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic diimide (DiMe-PTCDI) were
   investigated. These layers were grown on SGaAs(100) substrates by
   organic molecular beam deposition in ultra-high vacuum. Ag, In, and Mg
   were thermally evaporated onto the organic layers and the Raman spectra
   were recorded in situ. The results reveal that Ag and Mg form an abrupt
   interface while In strongly diffuses into the organic layers. Mg, on the
   other hand, undergoes strong chemical reaction with PTCDA. The
   experiments also benefit from a strong enhancement of the scattering
   intensity which is induced by the rough morphology of deposited metals.
   The enhancement factors as a function of nominal metal coverage and the
   subsequent attenuation at large metal coverages deliver valuable
   information on the metal morphology which is discussed in comparison to
   additional atomic force microscopy results. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Monomeric acetic acid M-A and propionic acid M-P were isolated in argon
   matrices at 10 K by using a pulse deposition technique. The dimerization

   Under these conditions the diffusion of small trapped molecules is rapid
   and the dimerization could be monitored directly by IR spectroscopy.
   Both carboxylic acids form the symmetrical dimers B with two strong
   C=O... HO hydrogen bridges as the thermodynamically most stable dimers.
   With acetic acid a less stable dimer A(A) could be obtained if high
   concentrations of acetic acid in argon were used during the deposition
   of the matrix. On annealing this dimer rearranges to the more stable
   B-A. In contrast, propionic acid does not form a corresponding less
   stable dimer under any experimental condition. These observations are

Abstract = {{CONTEXT. Hormonal contraceptive users may be at increased risk for HIV
   and other STDs. An understanding of their decisions and abilities to use
   condoms is needed to focus intervention programs aimed at improving
   their protective behaviors.
   METHODS:Between 1999 and 2001, 426 new users of depot
   medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and oral contraceptives were
   recruited from public clinics providing family planning services to
   low-income women and surveyed when they began their method and again
   three months later. Bivariate analyses examined the consistency of
   condom use across subgroups, and multivariate analyses assessed
   associations between consistent use and various characteristics.
   RESULTS: Among women who had used condoms consistently before starting
   on DMPA or the pill, 54916 discontinued consistent use after taking
   these contraceptives. Overall, 20\% of women consistently used condoms
   with their hormonal method, and such use did not vary significantly by
   contraceptive type. Seventy-five percent of women in nonmonogamous
   relationships were inconsistent users, though nearly a third had been
   consistent users prior to beginning a hormonal method Factors associated
   with an elevated likelihood of consistent use were the male partner's
   positive opinion of condoms (odds ratio, 3.3) and the woman's strong
   belief that condom use is important for vaginal intercourse (3.5) and
   even if the couple is using another form of birth control (4.1).
   CONCLUSIONS. Many women at highest risk for disease have a decreased
   likelihood of using condoms, and disease prevention programs should be
   customized to target these women. Educational efforts focusing on
   women's attitudes and negotiation skills may be the best means of
   increasing dual method use.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the confining phase transition as a function of
   temperature for theories with dynamical fermions in the two index
   symmetric and antisymmetric representation of the gauge group. By
   studying the properties of the center of the gauge group we predict for
   an even number of colors a confining phase transition, if second order,
   to be in the universality class of Ising in three dimensions. This is
   due to the fact that the center group symmetry does not break completely
   for an even number of colors. For an odd number of colors the center
   group symmetry breaks completely. This pattern remains unaltered at a
   large number of colors. The confining/deconfining phase transition in
   these theories at large and finite N is not mapped in the one of super
   Yang-Mills theory. We extend the Polyakov loop effective theory to
   describe the confining phase transition of the theories studied here for
   a generic number of colors. Our results are not modified when adding
   matter in the same higher dimensional representations of the gauge
   group. We comment on the interplay between confinement and chiral
   symmetry in these theories and suggest that they are ideal laboratories
   to shed light on this issue also for ordinary QCD. We compare the free
   energy as a function of temperature for different theories. We find that
   the conjectured thermal inequality between the infrared and ultraviolet
   degrees of freedom computed using the free energy does not lead to new
   constraints on asymptotically free theories with fermions in higher
   dimensional representations of the gauge group. Since the center of the
   gauge group is an important quantity for the confinement properties at
   zero temperature our results are relevant here as well.}},

Abstract = {{Fecal specimens were obtained from 12-24-month-old dairy heifers on
   farms in Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North
   Carolina, and Florida. PCR positive specimens for Enterocytozoon
   bieneusi were found in 131 of 571 heifers examined (23\%) and on all the
   farms visited. The prevalence of E. bieneusi varied considerably across
   farms, with the lowest prevalence (4.7\%) on MD-2 and the highest
   prevalence (37.8\%) on NY-2. All PCR positive specimens that amplified
   the ITS region as well as a portion of the flanking large and small
   subunit ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced to determine the genotype(s)
   of the E. bieneusi present and six genotypes were identified. Most were
   identified as cattle-specific genotypes, previously reported from cattle
   as BEB1, BEB2, BEB3, and BEB4. Two isolates were genetically identical
   or similar to E. bienesusi reported as the human pathogens Peru 6 and
   Peru 9 (or D) genotypes. Although our data demonstrate the presence of
   zoonotic genotypes in cattle, most genotypes found in cattle were host
   specific.}},

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{The genetic population structure of Atlantic cod in Ullsfjord, north
   Norway, was studied by analysing allele frequencies at the scnDNA locus
   pantophysin (Pan 1) in 2597 fish. The Pan I frequencies displayed
   distinct horizontal stratification within the fjord, which persisted
   over seasons and years. In the spring spawning season, mature cod
   predominated by the Pan I-A allele typical for Norwegian coastal cod,
   inhabited the inner, more isolated part of the fjord, whereas immature
   cod predominated by the north-east Arctic cod typical Pan I-B allele
   were found in the outer part open to Barents Sea water. Young of the
   year caught in the autumn displayed a predominance of the Pan I-A allele
   throughout the fjord. The present study provides evidence for the
   existence of a local stock of breeding coastal cod in the inner part of
   Ullsfjord, whereas the outer part is likely to represent feeding grounds
   for young year classes of north-east Arctic cod. Comparisons with
   previous studies indicate, however, that there is temporal variation in
   the relative abundance of north-east Arctic cod and Norwegian coastal
   cod in the outer part of the fjord. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In automatic user interface adaptation, developers pursue the delivery
   of best-fit user interfaces according to the runtime-supplied profiles
   of individual end users and usage contexts. Software engineering of
   automatic interface adaptability entails: (a) storage and processing of
   user and usage-context profiles; (b) design and implementation of
   alternative interface components, to optimally support the various user
   activities and interface operations for different users and usage
   contexts; and (c) runtime decision-making, to choose on the fly the most
   appropriate alternative interface components, given the particular user
   and context profile. In automatic interface adaptation, the decision
   making process plays a key role in optimal on-the-fly interface
   assembly, engaging consolidated design wisdom in a computable form. A
   verifiable language has been designed and implemented which is
   particularly suited for the specification of adaptation-oriented
   decision-making logic, while also being easily deployable and usable by
   interface designers. This paper presents the language, its contextual
   role in adapted interface delivery and the automatic verification
   method. The employment of the language in an adaptation-design support
   tool is discussed, the latter automatically generating language rules by
   relying upon adaptation rule patterns. Finally, the deployment
   methodology of the language in supporting dynamic interface assembly is
   discussed, further generalizing towards dynamic software assembly, by
   introducing architectural contexts and polymorphic architectural
   containment.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Vlasov-Maxwell system models collisionless plasma. Solutions are
   considered that depend on one spatial variable, x, and two velocity
   variables, v, and v(2). As x -> -infinity it is required that the phase
   space densities of particles approach a prescribed function, F (v(1),
   v(2)), and all field components approach zero. It is assumed that F
   (v(1), v(2)) = 0 if v(1) <= W-1, where W-1 is a positive constant. An
   external magnetic field is prescribed and taken small enough so that no
   particle is reflected (v(1) remains positive).
   The main issue is to identify the large-time behavior; is a steady state
   approached and, if so, can it be identified from the time independent
   Vlasov-Maxwell system? The time-dependent problem is solved numerically
   using a particle method, and it is observed that a steady state is
   approached (on a bounded x interval) for large time. For this steady
   state, one component of the electric field is zero at all points, the
   other oscillates without decay for x large; in contrast the magnetic
   field tends to zero for large x. Then it is proven analytically that if
   the external magnetic field is sufficiently small, then (a reformulation
   of) the steady problem has a unique solution with B -> 0 as x ->
   +infinity 0. Thus the ``downstream{''} condition, B -> 0 as x ->
   +infinity, is used to identify the large time limit of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Sex differences exist in the structure and function of the cholinergic
   septo-hippocampal system throughout the lifespan of mammals. How and
   when these sex differences originate is unclear. Because estrogen
   modulates sexual differentiation of several brain regions during
   development and influences neurogenesis in adult mammals, we
   hypothesized that sexual dimorphism of the cholinergic septo-hippocampal
   system would extend to its neurogenesis. A birthdating agent
   5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected into pregnant dams on one
   of eight gestational days, ranging from embryonic day (E)10 to E17. The
   offspring were euthanized at 2 months of age, and brains were processed
   for BrdU and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity to label
   cholinergic neurons that became postmitotic on a given embryonic day and
   survived to adulthood. Unbiased stereology was used to compare the
   number of double-labeled neurons in the medial septum (MS) of female and
   male offspring. Cholinergic neurons in the MS were generated primarily
   between E11 and E14, similar to other published reports. We found sex
   differences in the pattern of peak neurogenesis but not in the length of
   neurogenesis, or in total number of neurons generated in the MS.
   Additionally, in adult female and male mice, we estimated the total
   number of cholinergic neurons using unbiased stereology and found no sex
   differences in the number of cholinergic neurons or in the volume of the
   MS in adulthood. These results suggest that sex differences noted in the
   function of the postnatal cholinergic septohippocampal system may
   originate from its neurogenesis. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in wind forcing over summer first-year sea ice (FYI) melt
   ponds occur at hourly to weekly scales and are a significant contributor
   to microwave backscatter (sigma degrees) variability observed from
   spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) platforms (e.g., ENVISAT-ASAR
   and RADARSAT-1). This variability impairs our ability to use SAR to
   derive information on summer sea ice thermodynamic state and energy
   balance parameters such as albedo and melt pond fraction. The surface
   roughness contribution of FYI melt ponds in the Canadian Arctic
   Archipelago to like-polarized, C-band sigma degrees estimates is
   analyzed through a spectral and statistical analysis of surface wave
   height profiles for varying wind speeds, upwind fetch lengths, and melt
   pond depths. A unique derivation of melt pond surface wave height
   spectra is presented based on digital video of melt pond surface wave
   trains. Significant scale surface roughness was observed even at wind
   speeds of 3 m center dot s(-1), resulting in small perturbation model
   estimates of sigma degrees (HH) ranging from -5 dB at 20 degrees
   incidence to -22 dB at 50 degrees incidence. Results from a multivariate
   linear regression analysis show that 53.5\% of observed variance in
   sigma degrees (HH or VV) can be explained by wind speed, upwind fetch
   from melt pond edges, and melt. pond depth, with no appreciable
   difference in the relative contribution of explanatory variables.
   Modeled onmidirectional sigma degrees as a function of wind speed and
   incidence angle for 100-m transects collected throughout the melt pond
   season act to elaborate the role of fetch and depth, as well as the
   modulating effect of hummocks, on sigma degrees.}},

Abstract = {{The increase of live steam temperature and pressure in new steam power
   plants is certainly the most effective measure to realize the stipulated
   CO(2) reduction targets for the conventional power industry.
   The development of new materials becomes a key challenge on the way
   forward to a more efficient and sustainable power generation. There are
   two approaches being followed in materials technology in order to
   facilitate higher steam temperatures and pressures in the water steam
   cycle:
   1.) The development of new materials.
   2.) The use of oxidation resistant coatings on currently available
   materials with higher creep strength but inferior steam oxidation
   resistance.
   Both approaches are currently being followed in several R\&D projects
   worldwide.
   The development and qualification of coatings is complementary to the
   development of new materials. The object of the EC funded R\&D project
   SUPERCOAT is the development of new coatings according to the second
   approach. Eight partners from five European countries participate in the
   work. SUPERCOAT is the first R\&D project of its kind in Europe.
   This presentation covers the project targets, the efforts carried out
   while exploring the suitability of coatings for steam turbine components
   and the actual state of the work. As far as possible, an excerpt from
   the main results of coating development and lab testing will be
   presented. Additionally the applied deposition techniques, chosen
   according to practical criteria will be presented and applicability to
   certain components will be discussed.
   Complementary, the author will report on the efforts, carried out in the
   German Ministry of Economic Affairs funded project ``KONET{''}. In this
   field test, empirical data are being gained from a real operating power
   plant and can be compared with data from the SUPERCOAT lab tests.
   Finally, the next steps in the project SUPERCOAT will be presented and
   applicability of the coatings will be evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the study was to examine the link between motor attainments
   and sleep-wake regulation by comparing the sleep characteristics of
   infants who are crawling with the sleep of same-age infants who have not
   yet acquired the locomotion milestone. The participants were 59 healthy
   8-month-old infants with no developmental delays, who were recruited
   through well-baby clinics and childcare centers. The measurements
   included objective sleep recordings (actigraphy), sleep questionnaire,
   and motor milestones checklist. The main finding was that the sleep of
   crawlers was more fragmented in comparison to the sleep of pre-crawlers.
   While the findings of this report give support to the hypothesized link
   between sleep regulation and motor development, more studies are needed
   to clarify why crawling might provide a marker of nightwaking. In
   discussing the results, it is proposed that the association between
   fragmented sleep and crawling could be related to maturational,
   constitutional, and relational factors. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Background. Aldosterone has been suggested to play a role in the
   initiation and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Currently
   recommended treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
   inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers {[}renin-angiotensin
   system (RAS) blockade] does not suppress circulating aldosterone
   sufficiently. We therefore aimed to evaluate the short-term effect of
   aldosterone antagonism with spironolactone on albuminuria and blood
   pressure in diabetic nephropathy.
   Methods. Twenty Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients with persistent
   macroalbuminuria despite antihypertensive treatment, including RAS
   blockade, completed this double-masked, randomized cross-over trial.
   Patients were treated in random order with spironolactone 25 mg once
   daily and matched placebo for two months, respectively, on top of usual
   antihypertensive treatment. After each treatment period albuminuria,
   24-hour blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were
   determined.
   Results. Spironolactone on top of usual antihypertensive treatment
   induced a 30\% (95\% CI 17 to 41) reduction in albuminuria from
   {[}geometric mean (95\% CI)] 831 (624 to 1106) mg/24-hour on placebo
   treatment (P < 0.001), and a reduction in fractional albumin clearance
   of 35\% (20 to 46, P < 0.001). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure showed an
   insignificant reduction of {[}mean reduction (95\% CI)] 8 (-1 to 17)/3
   (-0.2 to 7) mm Hg (P < 0.10). There was an insignificant reversible
   reduction in GFR during treatment with spironolactone. On spironolactone
   treatment, one patient was excluded due to hyperkalemia (plasma
   potassium 5.7 mmol/L) and one due to orthostatic dizziness. Otherwise
   treatment was well tolerated.
   Conclusion. Our results suggest that spironolactone treatment on top of
   recommended antihypertensive treatment reduces blood pressure and may
   offer additional renoprotection in type 1 diabetic patients with
   diabetic nephropathy.}},

Abstract = {{Consider an employer who wants her employee to work hard. As is well
   known from the efficiency wage literature, the employer must pay the
   (wealth-constrained) employee a positive rent to provide incentives for
   exerting unobservable effort. Alternatively, the employer could make
   effort observable by costly workplace surveillance. It is argued that a
   privacy protection law preventing surveillance may increase the total
   surplus. While such a law reduces the employer's profit, this loss can
   be overcompensated by the employee's gain, because the employer invests
   in surveillance not only to implement higher effort, but also to reduce
   the employee's rent. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the experiments was to produce and identify different
   Triticum aestivum - Aegilops biuncialis disomic addition lines. To
   facilitate the exact identification of the Ae. biuncialis chromosomes in
   these Triticum aestivum - Ae. biuncialis disomic additions, it was
   necessary to analyze the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
   pattern of Ae. biuncialis (2n = 4x = 28, (UUMMb)-U-b-M-b-M-b), comparing
   it with the diploid progenitors (Aegilops umbellulata, 2n = 2x = 14, UU
   and Aegilops comosa, 2n = 2x = 14, MM). To identify the Ae. biuncialis
   chromosomes, FISH was carried out using 2 DNA clones (pSc119.2 and pAs1)
   on Ae. biuncialis and its 2 diploid progenitor species. Differences in
   the hybridization patterns of all chromosomes were observed among the 4
   Ae. umbellulata accessions, the 4 Ae. comosa accessions, and the 3 Ae.
   biuncialis accessions analyzed. The hybridization pattern of the M
   genome was more variable than that of the U genome. Five different wheat
   - Ae. biuncialis addition lines were produced from the wheat - Ae.
   biuncialis amphiploids produced earlier in Martonvasar. The 2M, 3M, 7M,
   3U, and 5U chromosome pairs were identified with FISH using 3 repetitive
   DNA clones (pSc119.2, pAs1, and pTa71) in the disomic chromosome
   additions produced. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) was used to
   differentiate the Ae. biuncialis chromosomes from wheat, but no
   chromosome rearrangements between wheat and Ae. biuncialis were detected
   in the addition lines.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial load and biodegradable organic carbon were investigated in the
   conventional feedwater pretreatment train of the RO plant of the Alberto
   Pasqualini refinery, whose membranes were severely affected by
   biofouling. Biofilm fragments were detected in water samples from all
   parts of the pretreatment system. Total planktonic counts were reduced
   by approximately 60\% in the flocculation/filtration step and remained
   steady at between 1.0 and 3.4 x 10(6) cells/mL in the remainder of the
   plant. Plate counts (about 10(4) cells/mL) were totally suppressed by
   free chlorine, but were restored to their original values after the
   activated carbon filter. DOC increased from 7 to 8 mg/L in raw water to
   17 mg/L after chlorination/flocculation and remained steady at 3-4 mg/L
   after sand filtration. AOC of feedwater (0.9 mg/L) increased 3.5-fold
   after chlorination and addition of flocculants and diminished to between
   1.2 and 1.6 mg/L after the sand filter. The proportion of AOC in DOC
   increased from 10\% to 17\% before sand filtration to 30-50\%
   afterwards. BDOC assays indicated that all sections of the plant were
   colonized by a physiologically active microbiota, which was capable of
   cryptic growth. Sand, activated carbon and cartridge filters contained
   5.0 x 10(7), 1.9 x 10(7) and 1.6 x 10(8) cells/g, respectively. A dose
   of the commercial biocide 30 times larger than the one used at the plant
   was necessary for total suppression of microbial growth in RO feedwater.
   The biocide did not prevent biofilm growth on RO membranes, but the fact
   that 30-day cleaning intervals could only be maintained by continuous
   biocide use indicates it affected biofilm structure. Chlorination of raw
   water and of pulsator sludge increased AOC by 30\% and 400-600\%,
   respectively. The organic flocculant used at the plant did not support
   microbial growth. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During collisional convergence, failure in extension of the lithosphere
   of the lower plate due to slab pull will reduce the thickness or
   completely remove lower-plate lithosphere and cause decompression
   melting of the asthenospheric mantle; magmas from this source may
   subsequently provide enough heat for substantial partial melting of
   crustal rocks under or beyond the toe of the collisional accretionary
   system. In central Maine, United States, this type of magmatism is first
   apparent in the Early Devonian West Branch Volcanics and equivalent
   mafic volcanics, in the slightly younger voluminous mafic/silicic
   magmatic event of the Moxie Gabbro-Katahdin batholith and related
   ignimbrite volcanism, and in other Early Devonian granitic plutons.
   Similar lower-plate collisional sequences with mafic and related silicic
   magmatism probably caused by slab breakoff are seen in the
   Miocene-Holocene Papuan orogen, and the Hercynian-Alleghenian belt.
   Magmatism of this type is significant because it gives evidence in those
   examples of whole-lithosphere extension. We infer that normal fault
   systems in outer trench slopes of collisional orogens in general, and
   possibly those of oceanic subduction zones, may not be primarily due to
   flexural bending, but are also driven by whole-lithosphere extension due
   to slab pull. The Maine Acadian example suggests that slab failure and
   this type of magmatism may be promoted by preexisting large
   margin-parallel faults in the lower plate.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Epidemiological studies have shown significant relationships
   between the use of dietary components and prostate cancer incidence and
   mortality. Large studies of primary prevention, which confirm these
   findings, are desirable but costly and difficult to design. The present
   tertiary prevention study reports on the effect of a dietary supplement
   in comparison with placebo on the rate of increase of prostate-specific
   antigen (PSA).
   Methods: 49 patients with a history of prostate cancer and rising PSA
   levels after radical prostatectomy (n = 34) or radiotherapy (n = 15)
   participated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
   study of a dietary supplement. Ethical approval of the protocol was
   obtained. Treatment periods of 10 weeks were separated by a 4-week
   washout period. The supplement consisted of soy, isoflavones, lycopene,
   silymarin and antioxidants as main ingredients. Changes in the rate of
   increase of PSA (PSA slope and doubling time) were the primary
   parameters of efficacy. Analyses according to intention to treat (ITT)
   and per protocol (PP) were carried out.
   Results: Baseline parameters did not differ between randomised groups.
   Five participants were lost to follow-up, however 46 could be evaluated
   in an ITT analysis. PP analysis could be performed in 42 men with at
   least 5 PSA measurements. Per protocol analysis showed a significant
   decrease in PSA slope (p = 0.030) and (2)log PSA slope (p = 0.041). This
   translates into a 2.6 fold increase in the PSA doubling time from 445 to
   1150 days for the supplement and placebo periods. No treatment-based
   changes in safety parameters were observed during the study.
   Conclusions: The soy-based dietary supplement utilised in this study was
   shown to delay PSA progression after potentially curative treatment in a
   significant fashion. More extensive studies of the supplement may be
   indicated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
   leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is characterized by degeneration of
   vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) of nearly all tissues studied so
   far. The clinical phenotype of CADASIL shows great variability. The
   disease is caused by mutations of the Notch3 gene encoding the
   transmembrane receptor Notch3, which is expressed predominantly in VSMC.
   In some patients, neuromuscular symptoms have been described. To
   investigate the fine structural features of peripheral nerve and muscle
   biopsy specimens in more cases and greater detail, seven electron
   microscopically confirmed CADASIL patients showing a variable amount of
   granular osmiophilic material on the surface of VSMC were included in
   this study. Pathogenic mutations within the cluster region (exon 3 and
   4) of the Notch3 gene were identified in six cases. Degeneration and
   regeneration of nerve fibers in the sural nerves, studied in four cases,
   was present, although moderate, in all nerve biopsy specimens, whereas
   an intramuscular nerve fascicle showed more severe changes. Enlarged
   mitochondria with needle-like calcium precipitates were repeatedly seen.
   In muscle biopsy specimens, some degree of neurogenic atrophy was
   apparent in addition to myopathic changes, including occasional ragged
   red fibers with abnormally large mitochondria, focal tubular aggregates,
   abnormal terminal cisternae, and myofibrillary abnormalities. Automated
   sequence analysis of the whole mitochondrial DNA performed in one
   patient revealed several nucleotide polymorphisms, which were not
   considered pathogenic. The findings suggest that in CADASIL degeneration
   of small blood vessels is initiated by defects of the surface membrane
   of VSMC. Dysfunction of these blood vessels may cause low-grade chronic
   ischemia with secondary hypoxidosis and a large variety of structural
   changes noted in skeletal muscle and peripheral nerves, although a
   primary influence of the underlying genetic defect can not be excluded.}},

Abstract = {{As the raw material for evolution, arbitrary RNA sequences represent the
   baseline for RNA structure formation and a standard to which evolved
   structures can be compared. Here, we set out to probe, using physical
   and chemical methods, the structural properties of RNAs having randomly
   generated oligonucleotide sequences that were of sufficient length and
   information content to encode complex, functional folds, yet were
   unbiased by either genealogical or functional constraints. Typically,
   these unevolved, nonfunctional RNAs had sequence-specific secondary
   structure configurations and compact magnesium-dependent conformational
   states comparable to those of evolved RNA isolates. But unlike evolved
   sequences, arbitrary sequences were prone to having multiple competing
   conformations. Thus, for RNAs the size of small ribozymes, natural
   selection seems necessary to achieve uniquely folding sequences, but not
   to account for the well-ordered secondary structures and overall
   compactness observed in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Small-dose theophylline can be a useful alternative in the treatment of
   bradycardia in patients with spinal cord injury. In this series of three
   cases, I describe its successful use for this indication. In one case,
   initiation of theophylline treatment also increased respiratory drive
   and minute ventilation. A possible mechanism is that theophylline
   increases the force of contraction of diaphragmatic muscles because of
   enhancement of calcium uptake through an adenosine-mediated channel. The
   antibradycardiac effect is probably mediated through one or more
   different molecular mechanisms, which seem to be mediated by inhibition
   of phosphodiesterase 3.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The clinical outcome of acid-related disorders treated by
   proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) might be dependent on the polymorphically
   expressed cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19, which is involved in PPI
   metabolism. We tested whether esomeprazole-induced healing of
   gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is related to CYP2C19 genotype.
   Methods: Two hundred five patients with GERD (Los Angeles classification
   grade A or B) were included in a case-control study according to
   endoscopic outcome (healed versus unhealed group, matched for
   confounders) after treatment with 40 mg esomeprazole daily for 4 weeks.
   The frequency of CYP2C19 genotypes was determined as the primary outcome
   measure for both groups. In a second trial plasma levels of esomeprazole
   and corresponding CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 metabolites (5-hydroxyomeprazole
   and omeprazole sulfone) were monitored in 10 CYP2C19 wild-type patients
   with GERD after the first and last doses (day 7) of 40 mg esomeprazole
   daily to calculate metabolic ratios.
   Results. CYP2C19 wild-type (n = 148) and heterozygous (n = 5 1) or
   homozygous variant (n = 6) patients did not differ with respect to
   baseline characteristics. The frequency distribution of CYP2C19
   genotypes was not different between patients with complete (75/100) and
   incomplete (73/105) healing (P = .65). When a single esomeprazole dose
   and multiple dosing were compared, the low contribution of CYP2C19 to
   the elimination of esomeprazole decreased further by 50\%. In contrast,
   the CYP3A4-dependent formation of omeprazole sulfane increased by 40\%,
   and consequently, the metabolic ratio of omeprazole sulfone to
   5-hydroxyomeprazole was elevated from 7.9 to 19.3 (P = .0004).
   Conclusion: In contrast to other PPIs, esomeprazole-induced healing of
   GERD is unrelated to the CYP2C19 genotype, which ran be explained by the
   metabolic shift toward the CYP3A4-mediated pathway.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of proton energy on single-event latchup (SEL) in present-day
   SRAMs is investigated over a wide range of proton energies and
   temperature. SRAMs from five different vendors were irradiated at proton
   energies from 20 to 500 MeV and at temperatures of 25 degrees and 85
   degrees C. For the SRAMs and radiation conditions examined in this work,
   proton energy SEL thresholds varied from as low as 20 MeV to as high as
   490 MeV. To gain insight into the observed effects, the heavy-ion SEL
   linear energy transfer (LET) thresholds of the SRAMs were measured and
   compared to high-energy transport calculations of proton interactions
   with different materials. For some SRAMs that showed proton-induced SEL,
   the heavy-ion SEL threshold LET was as high as 25 MeV-cm(2)/mg. Proton
   interactions with Si cannot generate nuclear recoils with LETs this
   large. Our nuclear scattering calculations suggest that the nuclear
   recoils are generated by proton interactions with tungsten. Tungsten
   plugs are commonly used in most high-density ICs fabricated today,
   including SRAMs. These results demonstrate that for system applications
   where latchups cannot be tolerated, SEL hardness assurance testing
   should be performed at a proton energy at least as high as the highest
   proton energy present in the system environment. Moreover, the best
   procedure to ensure that ICs will be latchup free in proton environments
   may be to use a heavy-ion source with LETs > 40 MeV-cm(2)/mg.}},

Abstract = {{The heterogeneity of somatizing patients influences outcomes, especially
   in unselected samples in primary care. A cluster analysis was performed
   as secondary analysis on an existing data set of 127 somatizing patients
   included in a randomized controlled clinical trial. Anxiety and
   depression (HADS), number and intensity of physical symptoms (SOMS),
   physical and emotional functioning (short form of the SF-36 Health
   Survey), health beliefs (KKU-G), and psychological distress (General
   Health Questionnaire) were used for clustering. Outcome, treatment
   satisfaction, and diagnosis were calculated and compared for the
   clusters. We differentiated three groups from this analysis: one with
   elevated emotional and physical stress, one in which emotional stress
   dominated, and one with low emotional and physical stress. The three
   groups did not differ in diagnoses of somatoform disorders. The
   high-stress groups improved over time, whereas the depression and
   emotional-functioning scores in the low-stress group deteriorated. All
   patients were satisfied with the treatment provided. Deterioration in
   the scores of the low-stress group may be a result of a clinically
   valuable change process, in that patients who were initially in denial
   were able to open up and admit their problems. The increased
   satisfaction with treatment supports this interpretation. This so-called
   response shift must be taken into account in the planning of studies.}},

Abstract = {{1. In landscapes influenced by anthropogenic activities, such as
   intensive agriculture, knowledge of the relative importance and
   interaction of environmental factors on the composition and function of
   local communities across a range of spatial scales is important for
   maintaining biodiversity.
   2. We analysed five arthropod taxa covering a broad range of functional
   aspects (wild bees, true bugs, carabid beetles, hoverflies and spiders)
   in 24 landscapes (4 x 4 km) across seven European countries along
   gradients of both land-use intensity and landscape structure.
   Species-environment relationships were examined in a hierarchical design
   of four main sets of environmental factors (country, land-use intensity,
   landscape structure, local habitat properties) that covered three
   spatial scales (region, landscape, local) by means of hierarchical
   variability partitioning using partial canonical correspondence
   analyses.
   3. Local community composition and the distribution of body size classes
   and trophic guilds were most affected by regional processes, which
   highly confounded landscape and local factors. After correcting for
   regional effects, factors at the landscape scale dominated over local
   habitat factors. Land-use intensity explained most of the variability in
   species data, whereas landscape characteristics (especially
   connectivity) accounted for most of the variability in body size and
   trophic guilds.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that management
   effort should be focused on land-use intensity and habitat connectivity
   in order to enhance diversity in agricultural landscapes. Since these
   factors are largely independent, specific conservation programmes may be
   developed with regards to socio-economic and agri-environmental
   requirements. Changes in either of these factors will enhance diversity
   but will also result in specific effects on local communities related to
   dispersal ability and the resource use of species.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The effects of endurance training on airway responsiveness in
   nonasthmatic subjects are poorly defined. We hypothesized that airway
   responsiveness may differ between nonelite endurance athletes and
   sedentary subjects, and studied healthy, nonelite runners and sedentary
   controls by single-dose methacholine challenges carried out in the
   absence of deep inspirations, in that deep inspirations are known to
   oppose airway narrowing in nonasthmatic subjects. Methods: A total of 20
   nonasthmatic nonelite runners (mean age +/- SD: 43.0 +/- 8.5 yr;
   training volume: 68 km(.)wk(-1); range: 40-100; racing experience: 11
   +/- 8 yr) and 20 sedentary controls (age: 44.0 +/- 20.6 yr) were
   studied, all of them being normoreactive to standard methacholine
   challenge up to 25 mg(.)mL(-1) concentration. All subjects were studied
   at rest; six runners were also studied about 1 h after completing the
   Palermo marathon (December 8, 2001). The primary outcome of the study
   was the inspiratory vital capacity (IVC) obtained after single-dose
   methacholine inhalation at the end of 20 min of deep inspiration
   prohibition. Results: At rest, IVC decreased by 10.5 +/- 8.1\% after
   challenge with methacholine at 75 mg(.)mL(-1) in athletes, and by 24.3
   +/- 16.1\% after a methacholine concentration of 52 +/- 5.7 mg(.)mL(-1)
   in sedentary controls (P = 0.002). The decreased response to
   methacholine in runners did not correlate with static lung volumes,
   amount of weekly training, or running experience. Conclusion:
   Methacholine challenge under deep inspiration prohibition revealed that
   endurance training attenuates airway responsiveness in nonasthmatic,
   nonelite runners. Airway hyporesponsiveness was potentiated after the
   marathon, suggesting involvement of humoral (i.e., catecholamine
   levels), airway factors (i.e., nitric oxide), or both in modulating
   air-way tone after exercise.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Studies show that satisfaction with nurse practitioner care
   is high when compared with GPs. Clinical outcomes are similar. Nurse
   practitioners spend significantly longer on consultations.
   Aim: We aimed to discover what nurse practitioners do with the extra
   time, and how their consultations differ from those of GPs.
   Design of study: Comparative content analysis of audiotape
   transcriptions of 18 matched pairs of nurse practitioner and GP
   consultations.
   Setting: Nine general practices in south Wales and south west England.
   Method: Consultations were taped and clinicians' utterances coded into
   categories developed inductively from the data, and deductively from the
   literature review.
   Results: Nurse practitioners spent twice as long with their patients and
   both patients and clinicians spoke more in nurse consultations. Nurses
   talked significantly more than GPs about treatments and, within this,
   talked significantly more about how to apply or carry out treatments.
   Weaker evidence was found for differences in the direction of nurses
   being more likely to: discuss social and emotional aspects of patients'
   lives; discuss the likely course of the patient's condition and side
   effects of treatments; and to use humour. Some of the extra time was
   also spent in getting doctors to approve treatment plans and sign
   prescriptions.
   Conclusions: The provision of more information in the longer nurse
   consultations may explain differences in patient satisfaction found in
   other studies. Clinicians need to consider how much information it is
   appropriate to provide to particular patients.}},

Abstract = {{Trp-262 of the Aspergillus niger family 3 beta-glucosidase is shown in
   this report to be a key residue for determining the ratio of this
   enzyme's hydrolytic and transglucosidic activities. TLC showed that when
   cellobiose was both the substrate and the acceptor, beta-glucosidases
   with substitutions (Phe, Ala, Leu, and Cys) for Trp-262 formed very high
   amounts of transglucosidic adducts. When pNPGlc was the substrate and
   the acceptor of the substituted beta-glucosidases, only transglucosidic
   adducts and pNP were produced. Little or no Glc could be detected,
   indicating that the reactions occurring were mainly transglucosidic. GLC
   studies with cellobiose quantitatively showed that one Glc was
   transferred for each free Glc produced. Since this is the maximum level
   of transglucosidation possible, this again showed that the reaction is
   predominantly transglucosidic. Analyses of the K-m and K-i values of
   cello-oligosaccharides of increasing length, of the Ki values of Glc and
   of the transglucosidic activity at low acceptor concentration, showed
   that substitution for Trp-262 causes poor binding at the binding site
   for the non-reducing Glc of the substrate while the affinity for other
   Glc units is only minimally affected. The acceptor sites become
   saturated with substrate (acceptor) at the concentrations needed for
   glucosidic bond cleavage and thus only transglucosidic reactions occur.
   In addition, the data indicate that substitution for Trp-262 causes the
   rate of the hydrolysis step (k(3)) to be small. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Polybrominated diphenyl others (PBDEs), including octa-decaBDEs, were

   two farms (reference and amended/flooded soils) in Sweden Sewage-sludge
   amendment at the research stations increased concentrations of all BDE
   congeners 2- to 13-fold, with the highest increases for BDE-209.
   Concentrations 100- to 1000-fold higher were seen in contaminated soils
   at both farms. BDE-209 was the predominant congener in all soils. Sigma
   PBDE concentrations in worms ranged from 3.1 to 38 000 ng/g lipid weight
   and were correlated to soil concentrations, including the octa-decaBDEs.
   Biota-soil accumulation factors declined in the following order: TeBDE >

   bioavailable from soils and accumulate in earthworms, presenting an
   exposure pathway into the terrestrial food web. High levels found at one

Abstract = {{The concept of delivering health services at a distance, or telemedicine
   is becoming an emerging tool for the field of surgery. For the surgical
   services, telepresence surgery through robotics is gradually being
   incorporated into health care practices. This article will provide a
   brief overview of the principles surrounding telemedicine and
   telepresence surgery as they specifically relate to robotics. Where
   limitations have been reached in laparoscopy, robotics has allowed
   further steps forward. The development of robotics in medicine has been
   a progression from passive to immersive technology. In gynecology, the
   utilization of robotics has evolved from the use of Aesop((R)), a
   robotic arm for camera manipulation, to full robotic systems such as
   Zeus((R)), and the daVinci((R)) surgical system. These systems have not
   only been used directly for a variety of procedures but have also become
   a useful tool for conferencing and the mentoring of surgeons from afar.
   As this mode of technology becomes assimilated into the culture of
   surgery and medicine globally, caution must be taken to carefully
   navigate the economic, legal and ethical implications of telemedicine.
   Despite the challenges faced, telepresence surgery holds promise for
   more widespread applications. (c) 2005 International Federation of

   Anticipating the effects of gravity when intercepting moving objects:
   differentiating up and down based on nonvisual cues. J Neurophysiol
   94:4471-4480,2005. First published August 24, 2005;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00527.2005. Intercepting an object requires a precise
   estimate of its time of arrival at the interception point ( time to
   contact or ``TTC{''}). It has been proposed that knowledge about
   gravitational acceleration can be combined with first-order,
   visual-field information to provide a better estimate of TTC when
   catching falling objects. In this experiment, we investigated the
   relative role of visual and nonvisual information on motor-response
   timing in an interceptive task. Subjects were immersed in a stereoscopic
   virtual environment and asked to intercept with a virtual racket a ball
   falling from above or rising from below. The ball moved with different
   initial velocities and could accelerate, decelerate, or move at a
   constant speed. Depending on the direction of motion, the acceleration
   or deceleration of the ball could therefore be congruent or not with the
   acceleration that would be expected due to the force of gravity acting
   on the ball. Although the best success rate was observed for balls
   moving at a constant velocity, we systematically found a cross-effect of
   ball direction and acceleration on success rate and response timing.
   Racket motion was triggered on average 25 ms earlier when the ball fell
   from above than when it rose from below, whatever the ball's true
   acceleration. As visual-flow information was the same in both cases,
   this shift indicates an influence of the ball's direction relative to
   gravity on response timing, consistent with the anticipation of the
   effects of gravity on the flight of the ball.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to determine whether insulin resistance (IR) is related to
   arterial stiffness in nondiabetic hypertensive patients, independent of
   metabolic status and gender. IR has been associated with increased
   arterial stiffness in patients with diabetes. In nondiabetic
   hypertensive patients, the correlation between IR and arterial stiffness
   has yet to be investigated. We enrolled 284 nondiabetic patients who
   were being treated for hypertension. At the time of enrollment, the
   patients underwent a baseline laboratory assessment including
   homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) IR index and pulse wave velocity
   (PWV). The HOMA IR index is used as a marker of IR, and brachial to
   ankle PWV (baPWV) was used as a marker of arterial stiffness. Of the 284
   study subjects, 121 were classified as having metabolic syndrome. The
   patients with metabolic syndrome were older than the non-metabolic
   syndrome patients (55.4 +/- 10.7 vs. 52.1 +/- 11.6 years, p=0.013), but
   there was no gender difference between the two groups. The average baPWV
   was significantly higher in the patients with metabolic syndrome (1,506
   +/- 235 vs. 1,435 +/- 211 cm/s, p=0.009). The HOMA index was
   independently associated with an increase in arterial stiffness
   (r=0.548, p < 0.001) after controlling for age, systolic blood pressure
   (SBP), heart rate, medication and gender. The independent association of
   HOMA with arterial stiffness was demonstrated in subgroup analysis,
   regardless of the metabolic status and gender. In conclusion, increased
   IR was associated with arterial stiffness, independent of age, baseline
   SBP, gender and heart rate. This independent association of IR was
   demonstrated regardless of gender and metabolic status.}},

Abstract = {{This research was conducted to determine the yield and water-use
   efficiency of maize under fixed and variable alternate furrow irrigation
   (fixed AFI, variable AFI) and every furrow irrigation (EFI) at different
   irrigation intervals in areas with shallow and deep groundwater. In
   variable AFI, water was applied to the furrow, which was dry in the
   previous irrigation cycle. The results indicated that even at 4-day
   irrigation intervals the water needs of maize on a fine textured soil in
   both areas (with deep and shallow water table) are not met by AFI. The
   decrease in grain yield due to water stress was mainly due to the
   decrease in the number of grains per cob and to a lesser extent to the
   decrease in 1000-grain weight. At the Kooshkak site with shallow
   groundwater (between 1.31 and 1.67 in), grain yields in AFI at 4- and
   7-day intervals were comparable to those obtained in EFI at 7- and
   10-day intervals, respectively. This might be due to the contribution of
   groundwater to the water use of the plant (about 5-10\%). In the Badjgah
   area, with deep water depth, grain yield in AFI at 7-day intervals was
   statistically lower than that obtained in EFI at 10-day interval. In
   AFI, a shorter irrigation interval (4-day) may alleviate the water
   stress and result in no yield reduction compared with that in EFI at
   7-day intervals even though water application was reduced. Furthermore,
   in the area with a shallow water table, AFI at 7-day intervals may be
   superior to EFI at 10-day irrigation intervals. When seasonal irrigation
   water is less than 700 mm, it may be preferable to use AFI at 10-day
   intervals to increase water-use efficiency, especially in areas with
   shallow groundwater. In general, when water was insufficient for full
   irrigation, the relative grain yield (yield per unit water applied) of
   maize under AFI was higher than those under EFI.}},

Abstract = {{A new method of crystal-chemical analysis of intermolecular interactions
   using the characteristics of the Voronoi-Dirichlet (VD) polyhedra of
   atoms in crystal structures was exemplified by transition metal
   carbonyls. From the crystal-chemical data on the compounds under
   consideration, the area (S-m) of the VD polyhedron faces corresponding
   to all the intermolecular contacts of one molecule, the total volume of
   the pyramids (V-m) whose bases are such faces and whose apices are
   occupied by the nuclei of the atoms involved in intermolecular contacts,
   and the total solid angle (Omega(m)) at which the intermolecular faces
   of VD polyhedra are seen from the corresponding nuclei of molecule atoms
   were determined. Most of the intermolecular interactions were shown to
   correspond to the contacts between nonmetal atoms of neighboring
   molecules. It was found that the enthalpy of sublimation of carbonyls is
   a linear function of V-m. This correlation dependence was used for
   calculating the enthalpy of sublimation of some carbonyls with known
   crystal structures but unknown thermochemical properties.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to determine whether there was a difference
   in glutamate within the dorsolateral. striatum in mice exhibiting either
   a high (HR) or low (LR) locomotor response to a novel environment. The
   number of line crossings over a 30-min-period when the mice were placed
   in a novel environment was determined, and those mice for which the
   values were above the mean were in the HR group and those with the
   values below the mean were in the LR group. In vivo micro-dialysis was
   carried out to determine the basal extracellular level of striatal
   glutamate, and the contralateral striatum was taken to measure the
   density of glutamate immunolabeling within nerve terminals making an
   asymmetrical (excitatory) synaptic contact using quantitative
   immuno-gold electron microscopy. There was a statistically significant
   difference (35\%) in the basal extracellular level of striatal glutamate
   between the HR and LR groups, with the HR group having a lower level,
   compared with that of the LR group. There was a 25\% difference in the
   density of nerve terminal glutamate immuno-gold labeling associated with
   the synaptic vesicle pool in the FIR, compared with that in the LR
   group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was
   no change in the basal extracellular level of striatal dopamine between
   the two groups, but there was a statistically significant difference
   (73\%) in the basal turnover ratio of striatal dopamine and its
   metabolites in the HR, compared with that in the LR group. The data
   suggests that the difference in extracellular striatal glutamate between
   the HR and LR groups is not due to an alteration in basal extracellular
   dopamine but could be due to an increase in dopamine turnover.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Cutaneous sensitivity to the tuberculin antigen is thought
   to indicate latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Some guidelines
   suggest treating end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) patients for LTBI on
   the basis of tuberculin positivity. The prevalence of tuberculin
   sensitivity and cutaneous anergy in Indian patients with ESRD and the
   utility of the tuberculin test for predicting post-transplant
   tuberculosis are not known.
   Methods. We prospectively studied cutaneous tuberculin reactivity and
   anergy in 108 ESRD patients and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy
   controls. Mumps antigen and tetanus toxoid were used as control
   antigens. Patients who failed to react to all antigens were classified
   as anergic. Seventy-nine patients underwent living donor kidney
   transplants and were followed-up for approximately 2 years.
   Results. About 44\% of ESRD patients and 66\% of controls showed
   tuberculin reactivity ( P = 0.0018). The prevalence of anergy was
   significantly higher in the ESRD population ( 44\% vs 16\%, P < 0.001).
   The haemoglobin, serum albumin and creatinine values were significantly
   higher amongst the tuberculin-reactor ESRD patients. Tuberculin
   positivity and anergy rates in a subgroup of well-nourished ESRD
   patients were similar to the control population. Four patients developed
   tuberculosis after transplantation. Tuberculin test had a sensitivity of
   50\% and a specificity of 52\% for post-transplant tuberculosis.
   Conclusions. In comparison to healthy controls, tuberculin reactivity
   rates are lower and anergy rates higher in Indian ESRD patients. There
   is a significant relationship between markers of nutritional status (
   haemoglobin, albumin and creatinine) and cutaneous reactivity.
   Pre-transplant Mantoux positivity has low sensitivity and specificity
   for predicting post-transplant tuberculosis.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Critical conditions for rill erosion are determined through
   laboratory experiments and one-dimensional numerical simulations.
   Relationships between rill flow characteristics and slope angle theta or
   plot size are studied both experimentally and numerically for realistic
   rainfall intensities. The experimental results show that maximum rill
   flow velocities occur within a specific range of slope angles, theta =
   30 degrees - 40 degrees, which is independent of plot size and degree of
   overland flow concentration. For a given plot size and rainfall
   intensity the threshold slope angle for rill erosion depends on a number
   of factors, including soil erodibility, the degree of overland flow
   concentration, and the effect of gravity on soil erosion. The effect of
   plot size on the stable rill width generated by rill erosion is also
   discussed along with its implications for soil loss predictions.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted for 3 years in silty clay loam (Aquic
   hapludoll) associated with water tables fluctuating between 0.05 and
   0.96 m depths from the surface. Tillage treatments for rice (Oryza
   sativa L.) were puddling by four passes of rotary puddler (PR), reduced
   puddling (ReP) for two passes of rotary puddler, conventional puddling
   (CP) and direct seeding without puddling (DSWP) in four replications.
   Tillage treatments for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were zero tillage
   (ZT) and conventional tillage (CT) superimposed over the plots of rice
   tillage treatments. Puddling caused a significant reduction in saturated
   hydraulic conductivity (Ks), infiltration rate (IR), and specific volume
   (Rv). The reduction in Ks in the PR plot at 30 days after transplanting
   was 27 and 46\% (3-year average) higher than in the ReP and DSWP plots,
   respectively, but was statistically at par with that in the CP plot in
   the surface tilled layer. This indicates that puddling by four passes of
   rotary puddler and that by conventional method adopted by farmers in
   those conditions gives the same level of control on percolation rate.
   Highest rice yield (5607 kg ha(-1)) was obtained in the PR plot, which
   was statistically equal to that in the ReP plot. Wheat yield was highest
   (4020kg ha(-1)) in the DSWP plot of rice under CT condition. Total
   average grain production (rice + wheat) was highest under ReP-CT
   treatment combination. Results thus show that quality of soil puddle
   obtained by half the efforts in conventional puddling was sufficient for
   a significantly high yield of rice with minimum deterioration of soil
   properties. Similarly, wheat sowing by conventional tillage in such a
   reduced puddling plots of rice was sufficient for a significantly high
   yield of wheat. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Surgery is the cornerstone of management in ovarian cancer.
   However, in high-risk and elderly patients there is a tendency for less
   aggressive surgery upfront. The aim of this study was to review
   cytoreductive surgery, with focus on complications and outcomes in
   patients with Multiple Surgical risk factors.
   Study design: Charts of patients with ovarian cancer from 1998 to 2002
   were retrospectively reviewed.
   Results: One hundred and forty patients were treated for ovarian cancer.
   Sixty-three patients (45\%) were elderly (>= 65 years), and 69 patients
   (49\%) had comorbidities. Optimal debulking (< 1 cm) was achieved in 123
   patients (88\%). There was no significant relation between complications
   and type of procedure, elderly age, comorbidities, or transfusions.
   Optimally debulked patients had a significantly longer survival than
   patients with suboptimal debulking (P < .001).
   Conclusion: Aggressive optimal cytoreduction can be achieved in the
   majority of patients with multiple surgical risk factors and is
   associated with a low complication rate. (c) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{This study describes the psychometric validation of the young parenting

   between one's experience of their parent's behaviors and the development
   of schema-level core beliefs. The YPI is a measure of perceived
   parenting experiences, hypothesized to represent the origins of negative
   core beliefs. This preliminary validation consisted of analyses of
   factor structure, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and
   construct validity. A large non-clinical student sample (N = 422)
   completed the YPI, and a subset also completed the Young Schema
   Questionnaire-Short form (YSQ-S). Factor analyses demonstrated that a
   shorter version of the questionnaire (YPI-R) could be developed to
   represent coherent and meaningful perceptions of each parent. The YPI-R
   consists of nine scales. Each scale had good test-retest reliability and
   adequate internal consistency. Significant associations between the
   YPI-R scales and negative core beliefs (as measured by the YSQ-S)
   indicated partial construct validity. At this preliminary stage, it can
   be concluded that the YPI-R has an acceptable level of psychometric
   utility. However, the hypothesized parenting-negative core belief links

Abstract = {{We present a case of an infant with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) who was

   a 33-year-old woman with no significant risk factors. The child lived
   for 3 months, during which he developed intractable dyspnea, hypoxemia,
   and cardiac dysfunction and he eventually died from septicemia and
   multiorgan failure. In addition to the facial phenotypic features and
   cardiac anomalies, the autopsy revealed the characteristic microscopic
   pulmonary findings of alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of
   pulmonary veins. This appears to be the first reported case of this
   anomaly associated with trisomy 21. In addition to the many reasons for
   pulmonary hypertension that occur in children with trisomy 21, alveolar
   capillary dysplasia may have to be included in the differential
   diagnosis although it appears to be a rare association.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that proinflammatory cytokines damage rodent
   neural precursor cells (NPCs), a source of self-renewing, multipotent
   cells that play an important role in the developing as well as adult
   brain. In this study, the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha
   (TNF-alpha) on cytokine and chemokine production by human NPCs (>98\%
   nestin- and >90\% A2B5-positive), obtained from 6- to 8-week-old fetal
   brain specimens, were evaluated. NPCs stimulated with this
   proinflammatory cytokine were found to produce abundant amounts of the
   chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1)/CC chemokine
   ligand 2 (CCL2) and interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10)/CXC
   chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) in a time- and concentration-dependent
   manner. TNF-alpha treatment also induced NPC apoptosis. Receptors for
   TNF {[}TNFRI (p55) and TNFRII (p75)] mRNA were constitutively expressed
   on NPCs. However, only TNFRI was involved in TNF-alpha-induced chemokine
   production and apoptosis by NPCs, as anti-TNFRI but not anti-TNFRII
   antibodies blocked the stimulatory effect. TNF-alpha treatment induced
   p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (HAPK) phosphorylation in NPCs, and
   S13202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, blocked TNF-alpha-induced chemokine
   production. Thus, this study demonstrated that NPCs constitutively
   express receptors for TNF-alpha, which when activated, trigger via a p38
   MAPK signaling pathway production of two chemokines, MCP-1/CCL2 and
   IP10/CXCL10, which are involved in infectious and inflammatory diseases

Abstract = {{Substrates and nutrients are often added to contaminated soil or
   groundwater to enhance bioremediation. Nevertheless, this practice may
   be counterproductive in some cases where nutrient addition might relieve
   selective pressure for pollutant biodegradation. Batch experiments with
   a homoacetogenic pure culture of Acetobacterium paludosum showed that
   anaerobic RDX degradation is the fastest when auxiliary growth
   substrates ( yeast extract plus fructose) and nitrogen sources (
   ammonium) are not added. This bacterium degraded RDX faster under
   autotrophic ( H-2-fed) than under heterotrophic conditions, even though
   heterotrophic growth was faster. The inhibitory effect of ammonium is
   postulated to be due to the repression of enzymes that initiate RDX
   degradation by reducing its nitro groups, based on the known fact that
   ammonia represses nitrate and nitrite reductases. This observation
   suggests that the absence of easily assimilated nitrogen sources, such
   as ammonium, enhances RDX degradation. Although specific end products of
   RDX degradation were not determined, the production of nitrous oxide (
   N2O) suggests that A. paludosum cleaved the triazine ring.}},

   intracellular Ca2+ oscillations based on the models of Atri et{*} a].
   {[}Biophys. J. 65 (1993) 1727] and Falcke et a]. {[}Biophys. J. 77
   (1999) 37]. The model reproduces the fact that mitochondrial Ca2+
   Cycling increases the frequency of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations, which
   accords with Kaftan's results. Moreover the model predicts that when the
   mitochondria overload with Ca2+, the CytoSoliC Ca2+ oscillations vanish,
   which may trigger apoptosis.}},

Title = {{Socio-demographic differences in food habits and preferences of school
   adolescents in Jiangsu Province, China}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify the differences in food habits and preferences
   among the adolescents according to socio-demographic characteristics.
   Design: Cross-sectional, cluster design survey in 2002.
   Setting: Eight middle schools in two distinct socio-economic areas of
   the Jiangsu province, China.
   Subjects: Some 824 young adolescents (12-14 y) attending public schools
   with a response rate of 99\%.
   Methods: A self-administered questionnaire containing questions on food
   and meal frequencies, food preferences and socio-demographic
   characteristics was used.
   Results: High socio-economic status (SES) and urban residence was
   positively associated with intake of high-energy foods, such as foods of
   animal origin, Western style foods and dairy products. In all, 76\% of
   the students had three meals a day regularly, but 8.1\% urban students
   vs 3.4\% rural students had breakfast only 1-3 times per week or less
   often. Daily fruit consumption was fairly common, but with clear
   differences by SES. Only about 42\% of the boys and 55\% of the girls
   from low SES families ate fruit daily, compared with 66\% and 72\%,
   respectively in the high SES families. Urban boys had the lowest
   proportion of daily consumers of vegetables (67.0\%). More urban
   students drank milk daily than the rural students (68.7 vs 38.5\%). The
   frequency of milk drinking also showed a strong positive association
   with SES. About 10\% of the high SES boys consumed hamburgers daily
   compared with 2.8\% of the low SES boys. More than half of the students
   reported a liking for Western style fast foods including hamburgers,
   soft drinks and chocolate. Among high SES boys, 21.5\% consumed soft
   drinks on a daily basis; however, as many as 72.3\% wanted to drink soft
   drinks more often if they could afford it.
   Conclusions: SES and urban location were positively associated with
   frequency of intake of high-energy foods. Reported food preferences may
   enforce this trend. Nutrition education for adolescents and parents is
   needed to promote healthy eating. Health Authorities should strengthen
   the monitoring of food intake and its association with overweight/
   obesity.

   Health and Social affairs under the auspices of the Norway-China Health

Abstract = {{In the current study, amine surface modified iron-oxide nanoparticles of
   6 rim diameter without polymer coating were fabricated in an aqueous
   solution by organic acid modification as an adherent following chemical
   coprecipitation. Structure and the superparamagnetic property of
   magnetite nanoparticles were characterized by selected area electron
   diffraction (SAED) and superconducting quantum interference measurement
   device (SQUID). X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and zeta
   potential measurements revealed cationic surface mostly decorated with
   terminal -NH3+. This feature enables them to function as a magnetic
   carrier for nucleotides via electrostatic interaction. in addition,
   Fe3O4/trypsin conjugates with well-preserved functional activity was
   demonstrated. The nanoparticles displayed excellent in vitro
   biocompatibility. The NMR and the in vitro MRI measurements showed
   significantly reduced water proton relaxation times of both T-1 and T-2.
   Significantly reduced T-2 and T-(2){*}-weighted signal intensity were
   observed in a 1.5 T clinical MR imager. In vivo imaging contrast effect
   showed a fast and prolonged inverse contrast effect in the liver that
   lasted for more than I week. In addition, it was found that the
   spherical Fe3O4 assembled as rod-like configuration through an aging
   process in aqueous solution at room temperature. Interestingly, TEM
   observation of the liver tissue revealed the rod-like shape but not the
   spherical-type nanoparticles being taken up by the Kupffer cells 120 h
   after tail vein infusion. Combining these results, we have demonstrated
   the potential applications of the newly synthesized magnetite
   nanoparticles in a broad spectrum of biomedical applications. (c) 2005

   viewed Russia as a disastrous and threatening failure, and the 1990s as
   a decade of catastrophe for its citizens. Analyzing a variety of

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To characterize age- and gender-related differences in
   refractive error, ocular biometry, and lens opalescence (NOP) in a
   population-based sample of adult Latinos. Also assessed were the
   determinants of age- related refractive differences.
   METHODS. Participants in the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES), a
   population-based study of Latinos aged 40 years and more, underwent an
   ophthalmic examination, including ultrasonic measurements of axial
   length (AL), vitreous chamber depth (VCD), anterior chamber depth (ACD),
   lens thickness (LT), and noncycloplegic automated and subjective
   refraction. Corneal curvature/power (CP) was measured using an
   autorefractor. NOP was graded at the slit lamp by an ophthalmologist
   using the Lens Opacity Classification System II. Age- and gender-related
   differences were calculated. Multiple regression models were used to
   identify the determinants of age-related refractive differences.
   RESULTS. Of the 6357 LALES participants, 5588 phakic individuals with
   biometric data were included in this analysis. Older individuals had
   shallower ACDs, thicker lenses, more NOP, and more hyperopia compared to
   younger individuals (P < 0.001). There was no age- related difference in
   AL (P >= 0.05). Women had significantly shorter AL, shallower ACD and
   VCD, than did men (P <= 0.01). The strongest determinants of refractive
   error were AL (primarily VCD) and CP. NOP was a small but significant
   determinant of refractive error in older individuals.
   CONCLUSIONS. Age- and gender-related differences in ocular biometric,
   refractive error, and NOP measurements are present in adult Latinos.
   While the relative contribution of NOP in determining refractive error
   is small, it is greater in older persons compared to younger
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The stress-resistance relationship of carbon fiber cement was studied.
   Attention has been paid to explore the improvement of the
   stress-resistance sensitivity under cycled stress restriction. The
   prismy carbon fiber cement sensors were pre-fabricated. The factors such
   (is contents of carbon fibers, silica, fume, dispersant and the w/c were
   taken into account. The electrical resistance variations with the
   dynamic and static loads were simulated using a strain-controlled test
   machine. The test results shou) that there is an optimal fiber content,
   with. which the compression-sensitivity achieves a high level. The
   addition of silica fume can improve the sensitivity. Under the optimall
   test conditions, the measured resistances can, greatly correspond with
   the changes of the load.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we promote a document-oriented approach to the development
   of content-intensive applications (i.e., applications that critically
   depend on the informational contents and on the characterization of the
   contents' structure). This approach is the result of our experience as
   developers in the educational and in the hypermedia domains, as well as
   in the domain of knowledge-based systems. The main reason for choosing
   the document-oriented approach is to make it easier for domain experts
   to comprehend the elements that represent the main application's
   features. Among these elements are: the application's contents, the
   application's customizable properties including those of its interface,
   and the structure of all this information. Therefore, in our approach,
   these features are represented by means of a set of application
   documents, which are marked up using a suitable descriptive
   Domain-Specific Markup Language (DSML). If this goal is fully
   accomplished, the application itself can be automatically produced by
   processing those documents with a suitable processor for the DSML
   defined. The document-oriented development enhances the production and
   maintenance of content-intensive applications, because the applications'
   features are described in the form of human-readable and editable
   documents, understandable by domain experts and suitable for automatic
   processing. Nevertheless, the main drawbacks of the approach are the
   planning overload of the whole production process and the costs of the
   provision and maintenance of the DSMLs and their processors. These
   drawbacks can be palliated by adopting an incremental strategy for the
   production and maintenance of the applications and also for the
   definition and the operationalization of the DSMLs.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Study Aims: Capsule enteroscopy has become a standard
   tool for the evaluation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Reviewing
   the video recordings of capsule examinations is time-consuming and
   requires prolonged attention. Recently, software that can recognize the
   frames containing ``red spots{''}, the Suspected Blood Identification
   system (SBIS), has been developed with the aim of assisting in the
   analysis of video recordings. We assessed the sensitivity and
   specificity of the SBIS in patients undergoing capsule enteroscopy.
   Patients and Methods: 100 consecutive patients underwent capsule
   enteroscopy at our tertiary referral center, for the following
   indications: obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (75 patients), metastatic
   carcinoid (7 patients) known or suspected Crohn's disease (5 patients),
   miscellaneous (13 patients). Capsule endoscopy was carried out by the
   standard method. Four gastroenter ologists, experienced in capsule
   endoscopy, reviewed the recordings.
   Results: Small-bowel visualization was obtained in 95 cases. The
   physicians identified 209 ``red spots{''}, 54 of which (25.8\%) were
   also identified by the SBIS. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and
   positive and negative predictive values of the SBIS, calculated on the
   number of true-positive, true-negative, false-positive and
   false-negative results, were 40.9\%, 70.7\%, 69.2\% and 42.6\%,
   respectively. Sensitivity was higher for the identification of red blood
   (60.9\%) than for noribleeding ``red{''} lesions such as arteriovenous
   malformations (25.8\%).
   Conclusions: The SBIS has low sensitivity and specificity. It can be
   used as a complementary and rapid screening tool, but complete review of
   the recordings is still necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Diurnal variation of height is largely ignored in the
   assessment of growth in children. Diurnal decrease in stature may effect
   the reliability of height measurement. In this study, the degree of

   Methods: A total of 478 children, aged 3-15 years (mean age 9.9 +/- 2.3
   years) were enrolled in the study. The height of children were measured
   twice in a day. The first measurements were taken between 09:00 and
   10:00 h and the second measurements between 15:00 and 16:00 h.
   Results: Children's height measurements differences were +1.8 to -2.7
   cm, and a mean of 0.47 +/- 0.05 cm decrease was determined.
   Conclusions: Little differences of height measurement could be very
   important in evaluating the short child. When the result of height
   measurement is recorded, recording the time of day is offered.}},

Abstract = {{Hereditary hemochromatosis is one of the most frequent genetic disorders
   in Europeans, but its prevalence in Poland is still unknown. The aim of
   the study was an initial assessment of the prevalence of C282Y and H62D
   HFE gene mutations and their influence on the course of chronic
   hepatitis C. Forty-one patients were admitted to the Department of
   Infectious Diseases, Medical University of Gdansk in 2000-2004 because
   of chronic liver diseases with accompanying disturbances in iron
   metabolism. Genetic tests for the C282Y and H63D mutations were
   performed by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)
   analysis. The HFE gene mutations were confirmed in 24 of 41 (59\%) cases
   with symptoms of chronic liver disease and iron overload, significantly
   more frequently in HCV-negative patients (12/14 vs. 12/27; chi(2) =
   8.28; p = 0.05). The C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations were detected in
   16 of 41 (39\%) and 9 of 41 (22\%) cases, respectively. HCV-negative
   patients were C282Y carriers significantly more frequently than
   HCV-positive patients {[}9/14 vs. 2/27 C282Y homozygotes; 2/14 vs. 3/27
   C282Y heterozygotes (p < 0.0001)]. The carrier state of the H63D HFE
   gene mutation was not significantly more frequent in HCV-positive than
   HCV-negative patients. HCV infection seems to be a negative predictive
   marker of HFE gene mutations in patients with iron overload. The
   relationship of H63D HFE gene mutations with chronic hepatitis C and the
   possible influence of HCV infection on iron metabolism needs further
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Object. The periventricular gray (PVG) zone and its continuation, the
   periaqueductal gray (PAG) substance, have been targets for deep brain
   stimulation (DBS) in the alleviation of intractable pain for longer than
   two decades. Nevertheless, the anatomical connectivity of this region
   has been fairly poorly defined. The effects of DBS in this region are
   probably related to the release of endogenous endorphins, but until the
   connectivity of this region is better understood the mechanisms will
   remain unclear.
   Methods. Diffusion tractography was used to trace the pathways of the
   PVG-PAG region in seven healthy human volunteers. Images were acquired
   with the aid of a 1.5-tesla magnetic resonance imaging system. The
   region of interest was located just lateral to the posterior commissure
   and extended caudally to the level of the superior colliculus.
   Probabilistic diffusion tractography was performed from each voxel in
   each patient's PVG-PAG region.
   The PVG-PAG region was found to yield descending projections to the
   spinal cord and cerebellum. Ascending projections to the thalamus and
   frontal lobes were also observed.
   Conclusions. These findings suggest that the PVG-PAG region may modulate
   pain by two mechanisms: one involving the antinociceptive system in the
   spinal cord and the other involving influences on the central pain
   network.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale patterning was accomplished for octadecylphosphonic acid (OPA)
   self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on mica using a novel
   electro-mechanical process based on scanning probe microscopy (SPM)
   techniques. In such a process, the combination of a mechanical force,
   applied by the SPM cantilever, and a strong electric field, generated at
   the SPM tip apex, is employed to create permanent or temporary patterns
   on OPA SAMs. The absence of electrical current enables the application
   of this electro-mechanical patterning process on any SAMs supported by
   insulating substrates.}},

Abstract = {{The process of gravitationally-induced particle creation (Hawking
   radiation), if it exists, necessitates, in accordance with general
   thermodynamic principles, a corresponding process of
   gravitationally-induced particle resorption into the vacuum. Although
   the former process occurs in the external vicinity of the Schwarzschild
   surface where matter density is relatively low, the latter process would
   be expected to occur inside the Schwarzschild surface where the stellar
   material is enormously compressed and fermions fill all quantum states
   up to the Fermi level. I show that the occurrence of particle resorption
   provides a general mechanism, irrespective of the interactions of the
   constituent particles, which halts the collapse of a black hole to a
   singular point and leads to an equilibrium state of macroscopic extent.}},

Abstract = {{The study examined a number of parameters of platelet function and

   It also examined the effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker
   eprosartan on these parameters. There were 30 patients with stage I or
   stage 2 hypertension plus 31 well-matched controls in this study.
   Phosphatidylserine, a measure of circulating activated platelets, was
   expressed more in hypertensive patients than in controls. Eprosartan
   partially corrected the enhanced platelet reactivity. There were greater
   numbers of activated platelet microparticles in hypertensive patients
   compared to controls. Again, eprosartan reduced this hyperproduction.
   Calcium kinetics of platelets were measured with flow cytometry using
   fluorescent markers. The free calcium concentration and its rise in
   response to thrombin were greater in hypertensive patients. Eprosartan
   significantly changed these parameters towards control values and
   reduced platelet activation.
   Thus, eprosartan has the potential to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic
   events in hypertensive patients.}},

Abstract = {{Territorial disputes between governments generate a significant amount

   reduce the transactions costs associated with international economic
   transactions. The plausibility of this claim is examined by showing that
   territorial disputes involve significant economic opportunity costs in
   the form of foregone bilateral trade. Theories of territorial politics
   should take into account the possibility of such joint gains in their
   models of state dispute behavior.}},

Abstract = {{This article shows how multilevel modelling can be used to study
   institutional variations in the gender differences in achievement. The
   results presented are from analyses of the degree classifications of
   22,433 individuals who graduated in mathematical sciences, from

   designed to measure gender differences in the achievement of first class
   honours in mathematical science degrees as a whole and within individual
   institutions. After allowing for students' entry qualifications, age,
   type of course and institution attended, no systematic gender difference
   was detected in the achievement of first class honours in mathematical
   sciences at any level of entry qualifications. However, there were
   statistically significant variations between universities in `gender
   difference added'. This variation between institutions in gender
   difference added was explained by the significant gender differences in
   the first class degree awards made by Oxford and Cambridge universities,
   with no significant evidence of gender differences in the first class

Abstract = {{Objectives: A handheld laser device that removes the stratum corneum,
   the major barrier to transdermal absorption, has recently been approved
   to assist with topical anesthesia before painful procedures such as
   intravenous carmulation. The authors assessed the cutaneous
   histomorphologic effects of the laser device and the ability of the
   laser-treated skin to resist infection in a porcine model. Methods: This
   was a blinded, randomized animal experiment using
   isoflurane-anesthetized young domestic pigs. The ventral surface of the
   animals was irradiated multiple times with a lightweight, portable
   erbium yttrium-aluminum-garnet unit or a sham laser. One third of the
   wounds were inoculated with a Staphylococcus aureus suspension. The
   treated areas were then covered with a dry dressing, and full-thickness
   biopsy specimens of the treated areas were obtained immediately after
   treatment and at three, seven, ten, and 14 days for blinded
   histopathologic evaluation using hematoxylin and eosin staining and
   electron microscopy. Quantitative bacterial counts were obtained at
   three days in wounds exposed to bacteria. Main outcomes were
   quantitative bacterial counts, presence of cellular necrosis, epidermal
   integrity, and dermal scarring. Data analysis was conducted with
   descriptive statistics. Results: Laser irradiation resulted in immediate
   disruption of the cornified layer of the skin and necrosis of the
   stratum spinosum in all treated areas. There were also focal areas of
   vacuolar alteration of the basal one third of the epidermis. There was
   no evidence of any damage to the basement membrane or the underlying
   dermis. At three days, the epidermis had healed and there was evidence
   of epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis that was completely resolved
   by 14 days. There were no infections and no scarring. Sham laser had no
   histomorphologic effects on the skin. There was no bacterial growth from
   all sham laser-treated wounds challenged with bacteria. Three of 20
   (15\%; 95\% confidence interval = 0\% to 31\%) laser-irradiated wounds
   that were challenged with bacteria grew between 280,000 and 1,600,000
   colony-forming units/g. Conclusions: Laser irradiation results in
   ablation of the stratum corneum and a superficial burn to the epidermis
   that heals by three to 14 days without any scarring or infection in
   pigs. Challenging laser-irradiated cutaneous wounds with a large
   bacterial inoculum resulted in bacterial growth in a minority of wounds.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical cross-linking of protein complexes has gained renewed interest
   in combination with mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction products
   as it allows a rapid mapping of protein interfaces, which is crucial for
   understanding protein/protein interactions. The identification of
   cross-linking products from the complex mixtures created after the
   cross-linking reaction, however, remains a daunting task. To facilitate
   the identification of cross-linking products, we explore the use of the
   commercially available biotinylated cross-linking reagent sulfo-SBED
   (sulfosuccinimidyl-2-{[}6-(biotinamido)-2-(p-azidobenzamido)-hexanoamido
   ]ethyl-l,3'-dithiopropionate). This trifunctional cross-linker possesses
   one amine-reactive and one photoreactive site and, additionally, allows
   an affinity-based enrichment of cross-linker containing species. As a
   model system, we chose the Ca(2+)-dependent complex between calmodulin
   and its target peptide M13, which represents a part of the C-terminal
   sequence of the skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase. After the
   cross-linking reaction, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) and one-dimensional gel
   electrophoresis were employed to check for the extent of cross-linking
   product formation. The cross-linking reaction mixtures were subjected to
   tryptic in-solution digestion. Biotinylated peptides, e.g., peptides
   that had been modified by the cross-linker as well as cross-linked
   peptides, were enriched on monomeric avidin beads after several washing
   steps had been performed. Peptide mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-TOFMS,
   nano-high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/nano-electrospray
   ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry
   (ESI-FTICRMS), and tandem MS. We demonstrate that an enrichment of
   cross-linker containing species allows a more efficient identification
   of interacting amino acid sequences in protein complexes. This strategy
   is expected to be especially beneficial for investigating large protein
   assemblies.}},

Title = {{Physical activity and active commuting to elementary school}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study was conducted to determine if fifth-grade students
   who walked or bicycled to school on a regular basis were more physically
   active than those that did not. Methods: The sample consists of 219
   fifth-grade students (10.3 +/- 0.6 yr, 44\% male, 58\% minority) from
   eight randomly selected urban and suburban elementary schools. Students
   wore an ActiGraph physical activity monitor during the same week that
   they completed a daily survey to report their mode of transportation to
   and from school. Students were categorized on the number of reported
   active commuting trips, to and from school, per week (regular; : >= 5 (N
   = 11), irregular; 1-4 (N = 25), nonactive; 0 (N = 183)). Results:
   Compared with both other groups, regular active commuters accumulated
   3\% more minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA; P =
   0.04) during weekdays. This weekday difference was because of regular
   active commuters accumulating 8.5\% more minutes of MVPA both before and
   after school (P <= 0.01). No difference in physical activity was seen
   among groups during school or in the evening. Based on the mean number
   of minutes the students wore their monitors on weekdays (800
   min(.)d(-1)), the 3\% difference translates into approximately 24
   additional minutes of MVPA per day for the regular active commuters.
   Conclusion: Walking to school was associated with approximately 24
   additional minutes of MVPA per day in fifth-grade students. Additional
   observational and experimental research in larger, more diverse samples
   is needed to further clarify the effects of active commuting to school
   on total daily physical activity and other health outcomes.}},
