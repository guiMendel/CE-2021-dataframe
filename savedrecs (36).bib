Abstract = {{One of the most troublesome medical problems today is infection of
   prosthetic devices with organisms that form polysaccharide biofilms.
   This combined with increasing antimicrobial drug resistance is making
   many infectious diseases incurable. Cryptococcus neoformans is a
   human-pathogenic fungus that has a polysaccharide capsule and can form
   biofilms in prosthetic medical devices. We developed a system to study
   cryptococcal biofilm formation in vitro and studied the effect of
   antibody to the C. neoformans capsular polysaccharide on this process. C
   neoformans biofilm formation was dependent on the presence of a
   polysaccharide capsule and correlated with the ability of capsular
   polysaccharide to bind the polystyrene solid support. Protective
   antibodies prevented biofilm formation whereas nonprotective antibodies
   were not effective. The mechanism of antibody action involved
   interference with capsular polysaccharide release from the fungal cell.
   In contrast, lactoferrin, an effector molecule of innate immune
   mechanisms, was unable to prevent fungal biofilm formation despite its
   efficacy against bacterial biofilms. Our results suggest a new role of
   adaptive humoral immunity whereby some antibodies can inhibit biofilm
   formation by encapsulated organisms. Vaccines that elicit antibody
   responses to capsular antigens and/or passive transfer of antibodies to
   microbial polysaccharides may be useful in preventing biofilm formation.}},

Abstract = {{Hard oriented PST crystals of a Ti-48 mol \%Al alloy, in which lamellar
   boundaries are aligned parallel or perpendicular to stress axis, were
   creep tested. PST crystals of different alpha(2) spacing were used: one
   has the equilibrium amount Of alpha(2) phase and the other contains an
   excess amount. Activation energy for creep rate of the former is 350
   kJ/mol, being close to that of self-diffusion. The other crystal having
   fine alpha(2) spacing provides lower creep rate due to its more
   significant strain hardening in the primary creep stage. This crystal
   shows substantially high activation energy of 5 10 kJ/mol. The superior
   creep resistance of the fine alpha(2) spacing and its high activation
   energy is discussed in conjunction with the characteristics and

Title = {{Doppler echocardiographic assessment of valvular regurgitation severity
   by measurement of the vena contracta: An in vitro validation study}},

Abstract = {{Background. Noninvasive quantitation of valvular regurgitation remains a
   difficult problem. Measurements of the vena contracta (VC) by color
   Doppler echocardiography have been proposed but limited data are
   available on the actual accuracy of this method.
   Methods: To evaluate how closely the color Doppler VC reflects the true
   fluid dynamic VC and the anatomic regurgitant orifice and whether this
   measurement is affected by flow changes, various models of valvular
   regurgitation were studied in an in vitro flow circuit. The VC diameter
   was measured with color Doppler using two different ultrasound systems
   (Agilent Sonos 5500; Agilent Technologies Inc, Palo Alto, Calif and
   Vingmed CPM 800; GE Healthcare, Chalfront St Giles, UK). Optical
   planimetry of the anatomic regurgitant orifice was performed, the true
   VC diameter was determined by laser particle flow visualization.
   Results: Because of flow contraction, the true VC diameter was
   consistently smaller than the anatomic regurgitant orifice diameter.
   Anatomic orifice and true VC only marginally changed with flow rate. The
   diameter of the color Doppler VC, however, not only overestimated the
   anatomic orifice diameter by 45\% to 60\% and the true VC diameter by
   130\% to 160\%, but was also highly affected by the flow rate and the
   ultrasound system. Despite these limitations a color Doppler VC diameter
   of 0.77 cm or more (Agilent) and 0.89 cm or more (Vingmed) detected
   severe regurgitation with a sensitivity of 93\% and 84\% and a
   specificity of 96\% and 79\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Color Doppler estimates of the VC markedly overestimate
   regurgitant orifice and true VC. In contrast to the true VC, Doppler
   measurements are significantly affected by flow rate and by the
   ultrasound system used. Nevertheless, they allow semiquantitative
   assessment of valvular regurgitation separating severe from nonsevere
   regurgitation with acceptable accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the formation of NdII-III lines in the atmospheres of

   overionization of NdII which weakens the NdII lines relative to the
   corresponding LTE line strengths at mild neodymium overabundance
   ({[}Nd/H]<2.5) and amplifies them at higher {[}Nd/H] values. NLTE
   abundance corrections grow with the effective temperature and reach 0.6
   dex at T-eff=9500 K for {[}Nd/H]=2.5. The NdIII lines are strengthened
   compared with LTE in all cases, and NLTE abundance corrections lie
   between -0.3 dex and -0.2 dex for T-eff between 7500 K and 9500 K. NLTE
   effects are larger for an inhomogeneous vertical abundance distribution
   compared with a homogeneous one resulting in positive NLTE abundance
   correction up to 1.3 dex for the NdII lines and in negative ones down to
   -0.5 dex for the NdIII lines. The neodymium distribution in the

Abstract = {{Background: Selective attention, the ability to focus on relevant
   stimuli for information processing while ignoring irrelevant stimuli, is
   pertinent to many human activities. However, there have been few
   attempts to measure circadian influences on selective attention.
   Methods: As part of a larger protocol, 14 female subjects spent 3 nights
   at a General Clinical Research Center. On a given night, subjects were
   awakened at either 24:00, 03:00, or 06:00 hours and administered a
   computerized flankers task using two levels of spacing for the flankers
   ({''}near,{''} 0.75 degrees; and ``far,{''} 1.5 degrees) and three types
   of flanker trials (compatible, incompatible, and neutral). Before
   sleeping on the first or second night, subjects were also administered
   the flankers task at 21:00. Results: Neutral flanker trials resulted in
   faster reaction times (RTs) at 2 1 :00 than the three nighttime
   conditions. The flanker effect (i.e., the difference between compatible
   and incompatible trials) was also significantly smaller in the 2 1:00
   condition, but did not differ among the other three conditions. An
   effect component analysis indicated significantly more interference than
   facilitation. For incompatible/far trials, there was a trend toward a
   slowing down of RT across the four time conditions. Conclusion: The
   present study demonstrated that the flankers task, which measures
   selective attention, may be a relevant measure of performance in
   circadian studies. The analyses suggest increases in RT if subjects are
   awakened from a bout of sleep, and if these results are confirmed,
   failures of selective attention mechanisms to inhibit stimuli that
   require a competing response when subjects are awakened from sleep.}},

   Glyceryl triacetate administration increases acetate, but not

Abstract = {{Canavan disease (CD) is a fatal genetic neurodegenerative disorder
   caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacylase, an enzyme that
   hydrolyzes N-acetylaspartate (NAA) into L-aspartate and acetate. Because
   aspartoacylase is localized in oligodendrocytes, and NAA-derived acetate
   is incorporated into myelin lipids, we hypothesize that an acetate
   deficiency in oligodendrocytes is responsible for the pathology in CD,
   and we propose acetate supplementation as a possible therapy. In our
   preclinical efforts toward this goal, we studied the effectiveness of
   orally administered glyceryl triacetate (GTA) and calcium acetate for
   increasing acetate levels in the murine brain. The concentrations of
   brain acetate and NAA were determined simultaneously after intragastric
   administration of GTA. We found that the acetate levels in brain were
   increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with a 17-fold increase
   observed at 1 to 2 h in 20- to 21-day-old mice at a dose of 5.8 g/kg
   GTA. NAA levels in the brain were not significantly increased under
   these conditions. Studies using mice at varying stages of development
   showed that the dose of GTA required to maintain similarly elevated
   acetate levels in the brain increased with age. Also, GTA was
   significantly more effective as an acetate source than calcium acetate.
   Chronic administration of GTA up to 25 days of age did not result in any
   overt pathology in the mice. Based on these results and the current Food
   and Drug Administration-approved use of GTA as a food additive, we
   propose that it is a potential candidate for use in acetate
   supplementation therapy for CD.}},

Title = {{The implantation of every embryo facilitates the chances of the

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the validity of a theoretical
   mathematical model to predict the pregnancy rate and the multiple
   pregnancy rate in IVF/oocyte donation programmes on the basis of the
   implantation rate and the number of transferred embryos.
   METHODS: A total of 1835 embryo transfers corresponding to three
   different programmes in two centres with different implantation rates
   were analysed. Pregnancy and multiple pregnancy rates observed in the
   aforementioned programmes were compared with those obtained following
   different mathematical models. Four models were tested: binomial model,
   ground model, maternal variability model and collaborative model. The
   goodness of fit was performed by means of the maximum likelihood fit
   method.
   RESULTS: The binomial model could not predict the pregnancy rate, and
   especially the multiple pregnancy rate. The multiple pregnancy rate
   predicted following the binomial model was much lower than observed, up
   to 40-fold reduced. Ground model and maternal variability model adjusted
   to the data with more precision, but were still not accurate. Finally,
   the collaborative model reproduced with very great accuracy both
   pregnancy rate and the multiple pregnancy rate. A collaborative
   parameter of 22\% was found, implying that the implantation probability
   of each embryo is increased by 22\% for every embryo previously
   implanted.
   CONCLUSIONS: Embryonic implantation does not follow a binomial law,
   showing that the implantation is not independent from the number of
   embryos implanted. The best fit to the data is obtained following a
   collaborative model by which the implantation of one embryo is
   facilitated by the implantation of other embryo(s). The mathematical
   formula of the collaborative model predicts very accurately the
   pregnancy rate and the multiple pregnancy rate in IVF/oocyte donation
   programmes, based on the implantation rate of this specific programme
   and the number of embryos transferred up to five embryos. We recommend
   using the aforementioned formula to quantify the pregnancy rate and the
   risk of multiple pregnancy in the counselling of the infertile couple at
   embryo transfer. Such a formula is freely available at
   www.ifca.unican.es/matorras/mathpreg/.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrated ethanol has been used to induce controlled myocardial
   infarct in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. We
   report the acute and early follow-up results of an alternative agent,
   n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) glue, in a dog model. In 11 mongrel dogs,
   we injected n-BCA into different branches of the left anterior
   descending artery. Biplane left ventriculogram and coronary angiogram
   were performed before and after injection. In the surviving animals, we
   performed programmed stimulation (PS) to test for inducible ventricular
   tachycardia (VT) 48 days later. Following euthanasia, the removed hearts
   were studied with computer tomography (CT) and gross and histologic
   examination. Three dogs were lost before injection. Four dogs died
   within 2 hr to 4 days, and four animals survived 48 days. Accidental
   embolization of n-BCA into nontarget vessels was documented in four
   subjects. In the n-BCA-injected animals, homogeneous circumscribed scar
   was demonstrated by CT and histology. The glue was confined strictly to
   the tributary of the injected vessel, infiltrating arterioles of 14 mu
   m. There was intense granulomatous reaction (GR) in the vessel wall and
   in the surrounding myocardium. Remote areas were unaffected. Monomorphic
   VT was not inducible with PS. We report a feasibility study of n-BCA
   injection to selected coronary arteries of dogs to cause controlled
   myocardial infarction. We demonstrated that the glue does not escape
   from the target artery through capillaries or small collateral vessels
   and thus produces a sharply demarcated and homogeneous scar, which is
   confined strictly to the supply zone of the injected vessel. Improvement
   of the delivery system is necessary to eliminate inadvertent
   embolization. Long-term follow-up is needed to study the GR induced by
   n-BCA. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{163-174}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Studies of feeding in bony fishes have almost universally demonstrated
   the ability of individuals to modulate their method of capture in
   response to differing stimuli. Preliminary evidence indicates that
   morphologically specialized inertial suction feeding sharks are the most
   likely fishes to lack inherent modulatory ability. We examined the
   ability of the nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum, to modulate its
   feeding behavior based on different food types and sizes. G. cirratum is
   an inertial suction feeding fish that is apparently stereotyped in its
   food capture behavior. Electromyography showed no statistical difference
   between feeding motor patterns based on food type (squid or fish) or
   size (gape width or twice gape width), although there were slight
   inter-individual differences in the onset of muscle firing for some
   muscles. Kinematic analysis showed a statistical difference in variables
   associated with durations for different food types, with the durations
   for all variables being faster for squid bites than fish bites, but no
   difference based on the size of the food item. This apparent lack of
   modulation may be associated with specialization of the morphology and
   behavior of G. cirratum for obligate suction prey capture. This
   functional specialization constrains the method in which G. cirratum
   captures prey but does not appear to result in dietary specialization.
   An unusual post capture spit-suck manipulation allows this shark to
   handle and ingest large prey.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate intraocular penetration of topical fluorescein in
   eyes with avascular blebs after trabeculectomy .
   DESIGN: Case control study.
   METHODS: The study included 11 eyes with open-angle glaucoma and
   functioning avascular blebs, six of which were treated with topical
   antiglaucomatous medications and had no history of surgery, 15 with
   open-angle glaucoma, and untreated eyes suspected of having open, angle
   glaucoma. The fluorescein concentration in the superior peripheral and
   central corneal stroma, and ante, nor chamber was determined 30 and 60
   minutes after fluorescein instillation.
   RESULTS: The fluorescein concentration in the superior cornea was
   significantly higher in eyes with blebs or those topically treated than
   in untreated eyes (P <.01); there was no significant difference in the
   central cornea. The fluorescein concentration in the anterior chamber
   was much higher in eyes with blebs than in those that were untreated or
   topically treated (P <.001).
   CONCLUSION: The presence of avascular filtering blebs greatly enhances
   intraocular penetration of topically instilled fluorescein.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report the metabolic and molecular changes in response
   to cold and drought induced in Osmyb4 transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana
   compared with the wildtype (WT). The rice Osmyb4 gene codes for a
   transcription factor (Myb4) induced by cold treatment and, in

   Mattana M, Baldoni E, Coraggio I (2004) Plant J 37: 115-127]. Here, we
   report the ability of Myb4 to induce also drought tolerance in
   Arabidopsis transgenic plants. By the use of nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) and enzymatic assays, we showed that several compatible solutes
   (glucose, fructose, sucrose, proline, glycine betaine and sinapoyl
   malate) accumulate in higher amount in Osmyb4-overexpressing plants with
   respect to the WT, both under normal and stress conditions. Considering
   proline, we also found that in transgenic plants the levels of the mRNAs
   coding for Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (EC not assigned)
   and for Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.12)
   were higher and lower, respectively. The constitutive activation of
   several stress-inducible pathways and different kinetics in the
   accumulation of several metabolites, in Myb4 transgenic plants, may
   represent an advantage to prepare plants to face the stress condition.
   Moreover, these results taken together suggest that Myb4 integrates the
   activation of multiple components of stress response.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of
   regression of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy on left atrial (LA) size
   and function in patients treated with telmisartan, an angiotensin II
   receptor blocker. Methods. Patients population included 80 patients with
   mild-moderate LV hypertrophy treated with telmisartan. Patients were
   followed over a period of 12 months from the start of telmisartan
   treatment. LA size was measured during systole from the parasternal
   long-axis view from M-mode. Atrial function was assessed by
   Doppler-echocardiography and the following parameters were measured:
   transmitral peak A velocity, atrial filling fraction, atrial ejection
   force (AEF), peak E velocity, deceleration time and isovolumic
   relaxation time, LA maximal and minimal volume, and LV cardiac mass
   index (LVMI). Results. All patients had an increased LVMI and decrease
   during follow-up. LA dimensions were greater at baseline and reduced
   after 1 year of treatment. LA volume indexes maximal volume, minimal
   volume and P volume were reduced compared with baseline value (maximal
   volume from 35 +/- 5 to 32 +/- 5, p < 0.05; minimal volumes from 14 +/-
   2 to 10 +/- 4, p < 0.05). AEF, a parameter of atrial systolic function,
   increased from 12 +/- 3 to 15 +/- 2.4 (p < 0.01). The reduction of LA
   volumes correlate with reduction of LVMI (LA maximal volume and LVMI r =
   0.45; p < 0.01; LA minimal volume and LVMI r = 0.34; p < 0.05). A
   positive correlation was also found between LV mass index and P volume
   (r = 0.41; p < 0.01), LV mass index and LA active emptying volume (r +
   0.39; p < 0.01), and LV mass index and LA total emptying volume (r =
   0.38; p < 0.05). Conclusions. The present study suggests that regression
   of LV hypertrophy due to telmisartan is associated with reduction of LA
   volumes that expresses variation of LV end-diastolic pressure. The
   reduction of LV end-diastolic pressure is associated with an increase in
   diastolic filling and with a significant reduction of active and passive
   emptying contribution of left atrium to LV stroke volume.}},

Abstract = {{Background This study examines the effectiveness of Calibrated Peer
   Review (TM) (CPR), a Web-based writing development program, to teach and
   assess medical students' patient note-writing skills in a standardized
   fashion.
   Method At the end of the clerkship year, 67 medical students were
   divided into three groups, introduced to CPR, and instructed in patient
   note-writing. Students then wrote notes for three clinical cases,
   presented in different order to each group. After training on
   faculty-calibrated standards, students evaluated their peers' notes and
   their own notes. Trained faculty, blinded to author, order, and group,
   also graded student notes.
   Results Faculty gave lower scores than students, but both groups found
   students' scores improved significantly from the first to the third note
   written.
   Conclusions Student-written patient notes improved in quality while
   using CPR. The program uses approaches valued in medicine (accurate peer
   review and self -reflection) to enhance performance.}},

Abstract = {{Studies show that perinatal nutritional iron deficiency (ID) produces
   learning and memory impairments in humans and animals. This suggests
   that the functional physiology of learning and cognitive centers in the
   brain, such as the hippocampus, may be compromised by developmental ID.
   The present study used electrophysiological brain slice methods to
   examine multiple measures of hippocampal synaptic efficacy from rats
   that were subjected to perinatal ID diets or control (CN) diets.
   Measures of synaptic efficacy were obtained from the first and last
   synaptic regions of the hippocampal tri-synaptic loop (i.e. the dentate
   gyrus (DG) and CA1). Rats were placed on ID or CN diets on gestational
   day 11, and hippocampal brain slices were prepared between postnatal day
   25 and 37. Results show that ID slices were not impaired in short-term
   (i.e. paired-pulse facilitation (PPF)) or long-term measures (i.e.
   long-term potentiation (LTP)) of synaptic plasticity in either the DG or
   CA1 areas. Input-output (IO) measures showed that synaptic transmission
   was reduced in both of these areas in the ID slices when compared with
   the CN slices. This suggests that ID-induced learning deficits may be
   the result of reductions in synaptic transmission throughout the
   hippocampus, and possibly in other learning and memory centers.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the effects of chronically elevated glucose
   concentrations on the pancreatic alpha-cell line alpha TC1-6. We show
   that basal glucagon secretion and proglucagon gene expression were
   increased in response to high glucose levels. The extent of acute
   stimulated secretion of glucagon was also increased in response to high
   glucose, as was the transcription of the prohormone processing enzymes
   PC1/3 and PC2. The secretion of GLP-1, a proglucagon-derived peptide
   produced by cleavage of proglucagon by PC1/3, was also increased in
   response to high glucose. Gene expression profiling experiments showed
   that a number of components of the regulated secretory pathway were
   up-regulated at high glucose concentrations, including processing
   enzymes and exocytotic proteins. Immunoblot analysis showed that the
   expression of the exocytotic SNARE proteins, as well as that of PC1/3,
   chromogranin A, and 7B2, were all increased after chronic exposure to
   high glucose levels. Immunocytochemistry showed no changes in the
   expression of the mature alpha-cell markers glucagon and brn-4 and no
   induction of the immature alpha-cell marker pdx-1. We conclude that
   chronically elevated glucose concentrations up-regulate the regulated
   secretory response of the alpha-cell.}},

   Design: Prospective, randomized clinical trial.
   Setting: A National Health Service Assisted Reproduction Unit.
   Patient(s): One hundred fifty women undergoing a fresh ET. Age more than
   40 years, a high basal FSH, a previous difficult ET, or more than six
   previous ETs were the exclusion criteria.
   Intervention(s): Women undergoing a fresh ET were randomized at the time
   of ET to either the Cook K-Jet or Wallace embryo transfer catheter. The
   randomization was stratified according to age and the number of previous

Abstract = {{This paper addresses optimal design and efficiency of two-phase (2P)
   case-control studies in which the first phase uses an error-prone
   exposure measure, Z, while the second phase measures true, dichotomous
   exposure, X, in a subset of subjects. Optimal design of a separate
   second phase, to be added to a preexisting study, is also investigated.
   Differential misclassification is assumed throughout. Results are also
   applicable to 2P cohort studies with error-prone and error-free measures
   of disease status but error-free exposure measures. While software based
   on the mean score method of Reilly and Pepe (1995, Biometrika 82,
   299-314) can find optimal designs given pilot data, the lack of simple
   formulae makes it difficult to generalize about efficiency compared to
   one-phase (1P) studies based on X alone. Here, formulae for the optimal
   ratios of cases to controls and first- to second-phase sizes, and the
   optimal second-phase stratified sampling fractions, given a fixed
   budget, are given. The maximum efficiency of 2P designs compared to a 1P
   design is deduced and is shown to be bounded from above by a function of
   the sensitivities and specificities of Z. The efficiency of `balanced'
   separate second-phase designs (Breslow and Cain, 1988, Biometrika 75,
   11-20)-in which equal numbers of subjects are chosen from each
   first-phase strata-compared to optimal design is deduced, enabling
   situations where balanced designs are nearly optimal to be identified.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: comparison of diagnostic, clinical and therapeutic features
   and their predictive value for the outcome of encopresis in children and
   adolescents.
   Methods: 85 children and adolescents (aged 9.6 +/- 3.2 years) with
   severe encopresis (ICD 10: F98.1) were investigated during inpatient
   treatment and 35 of them again 5.5 +/- 1.8 years later. Mentally
   retarded patients were excluded. Inpatient therapy consisted of treating
   constipation and/or stool regulation by means of laxatives, behavioural
   approaches, and the specific therapy of comorbid psychiatric disorders.
   Results: During inpatient treatment 22\% of the patients experienced
   total remission, 8\% an unchanged persistence of symptoms. Of the 35
   patients studied at follow-up 5.5 years later, 40\% were symptom-free.
   As main result. prognostic outcome depended significantly on sufficient
   treatment of obstipation. Another important factor was the specific
   therapeutic approach to psychiatric comorbidity, especially to ADHD. The
   outcome for patients with comorbid ICD 10: F43 was significantly better
   than for the other patients. Those who were symptom-free at discharge
   had significantly better long-term outcomes.
   Conclusions: Decisive to the success of encopresis treatment were the
   stool regulation, and the specific therapy of associated psychiatric
   illnesses, in particular of ADHD. Inpatient treatment revealed
   significantly better long-term outcomes where total remission had been
   achieved by the time of discharge from hospital.}},

Abstract = {{In an investigation of the postnatal growth of the vertebral column of
   the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), we recorded hind-foot length as a
   standard metric, along with skull, tail, femur, and tibia lengths,
   against which to compare the growth of axial components. We confirmed a
   nonlinear relationship of head-body length against hind-foot length,
   tail length, and tibia length across the time course from neonate to
   adult and also discovered a nonlinear relationship between both skull
   and femur length to head-body length. Differences, in growth rate are
   directly related to preweaning and postweaning periods. The pattern of
   differential growth was distinctly least pronounced for femoral length.
   We therefore advocate the latter as the most appropriate to use as an
   easily measured proxy for growth across the entire neonate to adult
   growth period. This study reveals implications for the choice of optimal
   variables used as size proxies and also suggests functional implications
   of shifts in form-function relationships from unweaned to weaned
   individuals. However, variation in body form across mammals and
   altricial versus precocial modes of natal expression will continue to
   complicate the search for appropriate comparative metrics in the Study
   of the development and evolution of body form.}},

Abstract = {{We make an exploratory study of how well dark energy models can be
   constrained using lensed arcs at different redshifts behind cluster
   lenses. Arcs trace the critical curves of clusters, and the growth of
   critical curves with source redshift is sensitive to the dark energy
   equation of state. Using analytical models and numerically simulated
   clusters, we explore the key factors involved in using cluster arcs as a
   probe of dark energy. We quantify the sensitivity to lens mass,
   concentration and ellipticity with analytical models that include the
   effects of dark energy on halo structure. We show with simple examples
   how degeneracies between mass models and cosmography may be broken using
   arcs at multiple redshifts or additional constraints on the lens density
   profile. However, we conclude that the requirements on the data are so
   stringent that it is very unlikely that robust constraints can be
   obtained from individual clusters. We argue that surveys of clusters,
   analysed in conjunction with numerical simulations, are a more promising
   prospect for arc cosmography.
   We use such numerically simulated clusters to estimate how large a
   sample of clusters/arcs could provide interesting constraints on dark
   energy models. We focus on the scatter produced by differences in the
   mass distribution of individual clusters. We find from our sample of
   simulated clusters that at least 1000 pairs of arcs are needed to obtain
   constraints if the mass distribution of individual clusters is taken to
   be undetermined. We discuss several unsolved problems that need study to
   develop this method fully for precision studies with future surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Floors made of precast concrete hollow-core slabs may be constructed
   without a structural concrete topping and with transverse tie
   reinforcement placed only out of the slabs. Longitudinal joints between
   adjacent precast units are filled with mortar on site. To ensure good
   diaphragm performance under seismic action, a special joint has been
   devised, in which the slab sides are profiled as continuous sinusoidal
   waved shear keys. The research involved experimental investigations and
   analytical modeling. The features of the joint and the means of
   production were first worked out. Then, a series of destructive tests
   were performed, on both short joint samples and full-scale floors, made
   of extruded prestressed hollow-core slabs without topping, all subjected
   to large in-plane loading reversals. They showed that, after the
   adhesion between the grout and precast concrete is overcome, a stable
   cyclic shear transfer mechanism develops, based on wedge action and
   friction raised at the wavy slab-mortar interface. The analytical
   studies led to a specific interface finite element, condensing the
   behavior of a segment of joint into two degrees of freedom. The model
   considers also the possibility of the joint being partially open, which
   may happen when the floor undergoes in-plane bending. This interface
   element, when implemented in a global model with ``shell{''} finite
   element representing the slabs, allows for numerical tests on the
   ultimate behavior of floors of various configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To perform a comprehensive, multifactorial analysis of potential
   risk factors (demographic and clinical) for contact allergy to neomycin
   sulfate, a common adverse reaction resulting from the topical use of
   this drug; especially in some subgroups of the population.
   Methods Retrospective analysis of allergy test data of the Information
   Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK, www.ivdk.org) between 1998
   and 2003, including all patients patch tested with a standard screening
   series because of suspected allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). As one
   outcome, a positive (allergic) test reaction to neomycin sulfate was
   considered. An alternative outcome included only those patients with a
   positive test to neomycin sulfate and a final diagnosis of ACD. The
   association between outcome and potential risk factors was analyzed with
   Poisson regression analysis, deriving prevalence ratios (PR) as risk
   estimates.
   Results Of the 47559 patients tested, 2.5\% had positive reactions to
   neomycin sulfate, while in 1.1\% ACD was additionally diagnosed. The
   results of the multifactorial analysis indicated that the risk of both
   outcomes decreased slightly during the period covered; was higher among
   patients with leg dermatitis; varied significantly with age and
   increased progressively with the number of additional positive reactions
   to other standard series allergens. Cross-reactivity to other,
   selectively tested, aminoglycoside antibiotics was substantial (K =
   0.67; 95\%CI: 0.63-0.71) for framycetin sulfate, to low (K = 0.33;
   95\%CI: 0.27-0.37) for gentamicin sulfate.
   Conclusions The prevalence of contact sensitization to neomycin sulfate
   was noteworthy among patients patch tested in the IVDK centers.
   Supplementing clinical epidemiology, neomycin contact allergy has been
   estimated to be relatively common even on the level of the unselected
   population (prevalence approx. 1\%). Hence, the topical use of neomycin
   sulfate by patients should be carefully monitored, considering its
   potential to induce ACD, with emphasis on subgroups at risk. Copyright

Abstract = {{Three members of Gab family docking proteins, Gab1, Gab2 and Gab3, have
   been identified in humans. Previous studies have found that the
   hepatocyte growth factor preferentially utilizes Gab1 for signalling,
   whereas Bcr-Abl selectively signals through Gab2. Gab1-SHP2 interaction
   has been shown to mediate ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase)
   activation by EGF (epidermal growth factor). However, it was unclear
   whether EGF selectively utilizes Gab1 for signalling to ERK and whether
   Gab2 is dispensable in cells where Gab1 and Gab2 are co-expressed. Using
   T47D and MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells that express endogenous Gab1
   and Gab2, we examined the role of these docking proteins in EGF-induced
   ERK activation. It was found that EGF induced a similar amount of
   SHP2-Gab1 and SHP2-Gab2 complexes. Expression of either SHP2-binding
   defective Gab1 or Gab2 mutant blocked EGF-induced ERK activation.
   Down-regulation of either Gab1 or Gab2 by siRNAs (small interfering
   RNAs) effectively inhibited the EGF-stimulated ERK activation pathway
   and cell migration. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of Gab1 siRNA
   could be rescued not only by expression of an exogenous mouse Gab1 but
   also by an exogenous human Gab2 and vice versa, but not by IRS1 (insulin
   receptor substrate 1). These results reveal that Gab2 plays a pivotal
   role in the EGF-induced ERK activation pathway and that it can
   complement the function of Gab I in the EGF signalling pathway.
   Furthermore, Gab1 and Gab2 are critical signalling threshold proteins
   for ERK activation by EGF.}},

Abstract = {{Canada thistle is one of the most troublesome and difficult weed species
   to control in established alfalfa grown for seed production. Current
   tools available for control are limited because of cultural management
   strategies associated with seed production. Alfalfa seed losses due to
   Canada thistle interference include both reduced yields from competition
   and increased seed loss during seed cleaning operations. Additional
   tools are needed to alleviate these losses. Field experiments were
   conducted in 1998, 1999, and 2000 at two locations in Park County, WY,
   to evaluate Canada thistle control and alfalfa tolerance to several
   postemergence herbicides. Bentazon, imazamox, imazethapyr, and MCPB were
   applied, alone or in combination, at different Canada thistle growth
   stages. Methylated seed oil (MSO) was added at 1.5\% v/v to the
   treatments containing imazamox or imazethapyr. MCPB applied alone when
   Canada thistle was 7.5- or 15-cm tall caused severe alfalfa injury (28
   to 40\%) and resulted in less Canada thistle control (23 to 27\%).
   Imazamox or imazethapyr applied alone when Canada thistle was 15-cm tall
   did not cause any significant alfalfa injury but resulted in
   unsatisfactory Canada thistle control (29 to 35\%). Bentazon was the
   only treatment containing a single herbicide that provided more than
   50\% Canada thistle control. The treatments providing the best balance
   between Canada thistle control (> 80\%) and alfalfa injury (< 13\%) were
   a single application of bentazon combined with either imazamox or
   imazethapyr. These two treatments also yielded the highest, more than
   800 kg/ha. Split applications of bentazon combined with imazamox or
   imazethapyr were similar to single applications.}},

Title = {{Uncertainties in estimating moisture fluxes over the Intra-Americas Sea}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{This study estimates discrepancies in moisture flux divergence in the
   Intra-Americas Sea (IAS; including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean
   Sea) calculated using sounding observations, the NCEP Eta
   high-resolution regional analysis, and the NCEP-NCAR coarse-resolution
   global reanalysis. The main purpose of this exercise is to quantify the
   uncertainties in the global reanalysis when it is used to calculate
   annual and interannual variability of moisture flux divergence in the
   region. An accurate estimate of moisture flux divergence is crucial to
   evaluate whether the IAS serves as a water vapor source for rainfall
   over the adjacent land. Using the three datasets, the uncertainties of
   calculated moisture flux divergence due to the design of the boundary of
   the area, mathematical algorithms, and spatial and temporal resolutions
   are quantified. The results show that the large seasonal and interannual
   variability in moisture flux divergence estimated using the NCEP-NCAR
   reanalysis is not compromised by these uncertainties. Therefore,
   NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, with its global coverage and long-term record, can
   be used to provide the best estimate of short climate variability of
   moisture flux divergence available to date. Further comparisons are made
   of the moisture flux divergence based on the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis with
   previous estimates using single-year sounding observations, as well as
   with multiyear estimates based on global datasets of surface evaporation
   and precipitation. It is shown that the previous estimates using
   single-year sounding observations bear large uncertainties because of
   interannual variability. Large uncertainties also exist in datasets of
   surface global evaporation and precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed record of the physical processes that operate during
   post-main-sequence evolution is contained in the internal chemical
   structure of white dwarfs. Global pulsations allow us to probe the

   prior nuclear burning, mixing and diffusion in these stars. I review the
   rapid evolution of structural models for helium atmosphere variable
   (DBV) white dwarfs over the past five years, and I present a new series
   of model fits using recent observations to illustrate the relative
   importance of various interior structures. By incorporating physically
   motivated C/O profiles into double-layered envelope models for the first
   time, I identify an optimal asteroseismic model that agrees with both
   diffusion theory and the expected nuclear burning history of the
   progenitor. I discuss the implications of this fundamental result, and I
   evaluate the prospects for continued progress in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The toxic effects of Cd, Cu, and Zn on four different marine
   phytoplankton, Dunaliella tertiolecta, Prorocentrum minimum,
   Synechococcus sp., and Thalassiosira weissflogii, were examined by
   comparing the cell-specific growth rate, pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM)
   parameters (maximum photosystem II quantum yield Phi(m) and operational
   quantum yield Phi(m)'), chlorophyll a content, and cellular metal
   concentration, over a 96-h period. The calculated no-observed-effect
   concentration (NOEC) based on both cell-specific growth rate and two PAM
   parameters (Phi(m) and Phi'(m)) were mostly identical. Thus, these PAM
   parameters and cell-specific growth rate were comparable in their
   sensitivities as the biomarkers for trace metal toxicity to marine
   phytoplankton. The cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. was the most
   sensitive species among the four algal species tested because of its
   higher cell surface to volume ratio. The toxicity of the three tested
   metals followed the order of Cd > Cu > Zn based on the cellular metal
   concentration of the four algae at the NOEC. The cellular metal
   bioaccumulation followed the same Freundlich isotherm for each metal
   regardless of the algal species, indicating that the metal accumulation
   was a nonmetabolic process under high ambient metal concentrations and
   that the cell surface metal binding was comparable among the different
   species. For all the algae examined in our study, the bioaccumulation
   potentials of Cu and Zn were similar to each other, while the Cd
   bioaccumulation was much lower under environmentally realistic metal
   concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Polyethylene wear particle generation is one of the most important
   factors affecting mid- to long-term results of total knee
   arthroplasties. It has been reported that the medial pivot total knee
   prosthesis (NIP) design and alumina ceramic femoral component reduce
   polyethylene wear. The aim of this study is to evaluate in vivo
   polyethylene wear particle generation in the newly introduced alumina
   NIP, in comparison with a metal NIP. Synovial fluid was obtained from 11
   knees with alumina MP and 15 knees with metal NIP at nine months after
   the operation. Polyethylene particles were isolated, and examined using
   scanning electron microscope and image analyzer. Total number of
   particles in each knee was 7.10+2.86 x 10(6) in alumina (mean +/-
   standard error), and 5.70 +/- 2.82 x 10(7) in metal MP (p=0.048).
   Particle size (equivalent circle diameter) was 0.78 +/- 0.04 mu m in
   alumina, and 0.66 +/- 0.06 mu m in metal MP (p = 0.120). Particle shape
   (aspect ratio) was 1.52 +/- 0.05 in alumina, and 1.88 +/- 0.11 in metal
   MP (p = 0.014). Apart from the femoral component, the material and
   manufacturing method of polyethylene insert differed between the two
   groups, although the sterilization method was the same. Alumina NIP
   generated fewer and rounder polyethylene wear particles than metal MP in
   early clinical stage, and could potentially reduce prevalence of
   osteolysis and aseptic loosening. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine whether gender differences in reports of
   problematic health care experiences are associated with characteristics
   of managed care.
   Data Sources. The 2002 Yale Consumer Experiences Survey (N = 5,000), a
   nationally representative sample of persons over 18 years of age with
   private health insurance, Interstudy Competitive Edge HMO Industry
   Report 2001, Area Resource File 2002, and the American Hospital
   Association Annual Survey of Hospitals 2002.
   Study Design. Independent and interactive effects of gender and managed
   care on reports of problematic health care experiences were modeled
   using weighted multivariate logistic regression.
   Principal Findings. Women were significantly more likely to report
   problems with their health care compared with men, even after
   controlling for gendered differences in expectations about medical care.
   Gender disparities in problem reporting were larger in plans that used
   certain managed care techniques, but smaller in plans using other
   methods. Some health plan managed care practices, including closed
   networks of providers and gatekeepers to specialty care, were associated
   with greater problem reporting among women, while others, such as
   requirements for primary care providers, were associated with greater
   problem reporting among men. Markets with higher HMO competition and
   penetration were associated with greater problem reporting among women,
   but reduced problem reporting among men. Women reported more problems in
   states that had enacted regulations governing access to OB/GYNs, while
   men reported more problems in states with regulations allowing
   specialists to act as primary care providers in health plans.
   Conclusions. There are nontrivial gender disparities in reports of
   problematic health care experiences. The differential consequences of
   managed care at both the plan and market levels explain a portion of
   these gender disparities in problem reporting.}},

Abstract = {{There is a wide variation in prevalence of spinocerebellar ataxia type I
   (SCA1) in different populations. In the present study, we observed SCA1
   in similar to 22\% (37/167 families) of the autosomal dominant
   cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) in the Indian population. We investigated the
   role of various genetic factors like repeat length, interruption pattern
   and chromosomal background in predisposing the repeats to instability in
   these families. We analyzed 12 markers (9 SNPs and 3 microsatellite
   markers) and found 3 of them, spanning a region of similar to 65 kbp to
   be linked with the disease locus in the Indian population. The haplotype
   C-4-C defined by rs1476464 (SNP9)-D6S288-rs2075974 (SNP1), which was
   extremely rare in nonaffected chromosomes (similar to 3\%), was observed
   to be significantly (P << 0.0000) associated with the expanded
   chromosomes in similar to 44\% of SCA1 families. This haplotype was
   found in all nonhuman primates. SNP1 (C/T), which showed a skewed
   allelic distribution between large (LN > 30 repeats) and small normal
   (SN <= 30 repeats) alleles (P < 0.0000) had similar allelic distribution
   (P = 0.3477) in LN and expanded alleles. Our study suggested that LN and
   expanded chromosomes linked with the ancestral C allele of SNP1 might
   have originated simultaneously during evolution by the lengthening of
   repeats. The LN alleles might have accumulated repeat stabilizing nonCAG
   interruptions during this process. Similar proportions of T allele in SN
   with single interruptions, LN and expanded chromosomes lend credence to
   the origin of expanded alleles from singly-interrupted chromosomes. Our
   analyses using markers linked (anchoring) to SCA1 suggest that
   prevalence of SCA1 is correlated to both repeat length and number of
   interruptions in the Indian population. The spectrum of these alleles
   also points toward the antiquity of SCA1 mutation in the Indian
   population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a nonlinear control scheme for deflection control of
   a flexible beam using shape memory alloy (SMAs) actuators. These
   actuators possess interesting properties in terms of force generation
   capacity, possibility of miniaturization, and power consumption.
   However, their use in precision applications is hampered by undesirable
   characteristics, such as nonlinearities, hysteresis, extreme temperature
   dependencies, and slow response. By taking into account the nonlinear
   and thermal characteristics, a control scheme based on partial feedback
   linearization is developed to regulate the forces exerted by a
   differential SMA actuator pair attached to a flexible beam. The
   regulated force corresponds to a specific position of the flexible beam;
   hence, regulating the force results in position regulation. Using a
   Lyapunov stability analysis, qualitative guidelines are provided for
   selecting controller gain parameters. Furthermore, performance of the
   developed control scheme is tested experimentally on a laboratory
   testbed.}},

Abstract = {{During the years 1997 to 2003 the medical services of the statutory
   health insurance in the German Federal State of Baden-Wurttemberg
   carried out a total survey regarding structure, process and outcome with
   regard to the quality of care of outpatients in the German long-term
   care insurance system. This survey provides information on the
   development of the quality of care. All outpatient nursing services
   licensed by the statutory long-term care insurance funds in
   Baden-Wurttemberg (n(1997-2000) 863; n(2000-2003) = 779) were subjected
   to a uniform assessment based on a consented concept applied in all
   German Federal States. Our results demonstrate a tendency to fewer but
   larger nursing services providing care for an increasing number of
   patients. Qualification of head nurses and of caregiving staff in
   general has significantly improved. Information for the patient/consumer
   on the conditions of contracts which have to be made between a nursing
   service and the patient is still deficient in more than 20\% of cases.
   Adherence to proper procedures in the process of nursing has improved,
   especially with respect to taking a complete medical/nursing history and
   defining the individual resources of a patient and aims for
   therapy/nursing. However, only in 1/3 of the cases could we find a
   documentation of continuous adaptation of the planning of therapy.
   Efforts of in-house quality management and internal quality assurance by
   the outpatient nursing services have improved. Regarding the outcome of
   nursing there has been a decrease in the provision of stimulating care
   from 87\% of cases to 75\%. The majority of patients of outpatient
   nursing services do not receive benefits of the long-term care insurance
   system but of the statutory health insurance. This fact underlines the
   importance of a general conceptual framework for internal and external
   quality assurance.}},

Abstract = {{Oceanographic conditions in the brackish central Baltic Sea are strongly
   linked to atmospheric forcing and the Unusual period of persistently
   strong westerlies that, since the late 1980s, have resulted in an
   increase in average water temperatures and decreasing salinity. These
   changes in temperature and salinity resulted in a change in the
   dominance of the mesozooplankton community from Pseudocalanus sp. to
   Temora longicornis and Acartia spp. Similar to the copepod Community,
   the central Baltic fish community shifted from cod (Gadus morhua),
   dominant during the 1980s, to sprat (Sprattus sprattus), dominant during
   the 1990s. Further, the commercially important pelagic fish species
   herring (Clupea harengus) and sprat exhibited reductions in growth.
   Using Principal Component and Correlation Analyses we investigated the
   temporal variability in the importance of the food supply as well as
   competition on condition of central Baltic pelagic fish species. Our
   results indicate that herring condition results from a combined effect

Abstract = {{One of the contributing factors to the poor performance of irrigation
   systems is improper water distribution. Traditionally, in irrigation
   canals water distribution schedules are determined based on descriptive
   methods. Application of optimization methods could improve performance
   of water delivery. In a case study, a single-objective zero-one
   programming method was used to develop an optimal water delivery
   schedule. Considering several objectives of irrigation systems and the
   difficulties of zero-one programming, a multi-objective simulated
   annealing optimization technique is utilized. Based on water
   requirements at delivery points, the developed model determines time and
   rate of water delivery. The canal capacity and operational stages are
   minimized and water requirements are satisfied as closely as possible.
   In order to test the applicability of the proposed model, the model is
   applied on the Feng-Jia-Shan Canal in China and compared with the
   results of Wang. The results show that the multi-objective optimization
   approach resulted in lower operational stages, while the canal capacity
   is reduced to the same level as Wang's study. The model is applied on
   the AMX canal of the Varamin irrigation network in Tehran, Iran. The
   model benefits from the advantages of SA techniques and could take into
   account several objectives and avoid the difficulties of zero-one
   programming. This model could be used as an efficient tool for planning
   water delivery schedules in irrigation canals. Copyright (c) 2005 John

Abstract = {{Cross-reactions between food allergens and other allergens are a major
   focus of interest. They include cross-allergies between Betulaceae and
   Compositae pollen, and also between fruits and vegetables (Prunoideae
   and Apiaceae). Cross-allergies between animal allergens include mites,
   cockroaches and crustaceans, milk and meat, animal epithelia, meat and
   egg. Cross-reactivity, results from homology between protein sequences,
   and is highly likely when this homology reaches about 70\%.
   Phylogenetically similar proteins occur in all species and arc known as
   pan allergens. Profilins, Bet v1 homologues, and lipid transfer proteins
   have varying degrees of clinical relevance. The involvement of
   cross-reactivity in the persistence of sensitization and in allergic
   disorders is unclear The consequences of cross-reactivity during
   specific immunotherapy with total allergenic extracts are random.
   Interpretation of biological tests of IgE binding is also biased by
   cross-reactivity. The use of panels of major recombinant allergens
   should help to identify specific sensitization profiles as well as
   clinically relevant sensitization. Cross-reactivity between epitopes of
   inhalants and of food allergens may perpetuate and intensify allergic
   disorders. The consequences of cross-reactivity between allergens and
   autologous proteins are unknown.}},

Abstract = {{The retreat-building midge Pagastia prob. parica (Roback) is an abundant
   and conspicuous member of the benthic community of the upper Colorado
   River. We investigated the ecology and behaviour of P. partica in this
   regulated stream using both qualitative observations and quantitative
   surveys. Our studies revealed that P. partica foraged primarily by
   grazing algae from their retreats and adjacent surfaces and exhibited
   territorial behavior toward other P. partica larvae. Pagastica partica
   were widely distributed among streambed surfaces but preferred those
   with higher biomasses of periphyton and swifter currents. The retreats
   of P. partica were composed largely of silk and colonized algae and were
   important structural habitat features for other benthic fauna. We found
   numerous small benthic invertebrates cohabiting retreats, while larger
   insects were observed to have distinct affinities for or aversions to
   retreat-structured surfaces. Our results indicate that P. partica is not
   only an abundant member of this benthic community, but also a habitat
   engineer whose retreats represent an important component of streambed
   habitat for upper Colorado River benthos.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we examined stimulus-driven neuromagnetic activity
   in a delayed Pavlovian aversive conditioning paradigm using steady state
   visual evoked fields (SSVEF). Subjects showing an accelerative heart
   rate (HR) component to the CS+ during learning trials exhibited an
   increased activation in sensory and parietal cortex due to CS+ depiction
   in the extinction block. This was accompanied by a selective orientation
   response (OR) to the CS+ during extinction as indexed by HR
   deceleration. However, they did not show any differential cortical
   activation patterns during acquisition. In contrast, subjects not
   showing an accelerative HR component but rather unspecific HR changes
   during learning were characterized by greater activity in left
   orbito-frontal brain regions in the acquisition block but did not show
   differential SSVEF patterns during extinction. The results suggest that
   participants expressing different HR responses also differ in their
   stimulus-driven neuromagnetic response pattern to an aversively
   conditioned stimulus. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (QTNV) are very
   uncomfortable symptoms for patients with cancer, which can be
   circumvented in most of them with drug combinations containing serotonin
   receptor antagonists (5-HT3 receptor antagonists) such as granisetron.
   In an attempt to decrease costs of QTNV prophylaxis, we studied a lower
   dose regimen of granisetron. Patients and methods: Sixty patients with
   cancer scheduled to receive moderately/highly emetogenic chemotherapy
   were pretreated 1 h before with 0.5 mg granisetron p.o. combined with
   dexamethasone 20 mg i.v. Results: We observed complete control for
   nausea, vomiting, and nausea and vomiting in 78\% {[}95\% confidence
   interval (CI), 67-89\%], 61\% (95\% CI, 47.5-74.5\%), and 58\% (95\% CI,
   44.3-71.7\%) of the patients, respectively. This regimen was very well
   tolerated; headache (35\%), xerostomia (11\%), and constipation (5\%)
   were the most frequent adverse symptoms reported. Conclusions: The
   regimen with lower dose granisetron is effective for acute QTNV
   prophylaxis and offers a cheaper alternative for QTNV control. We feel
   that these encouraging results should be confirmed in a randomized
   comparative trial.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The incidence of chromosomal anomalies in patients with

   Methods: This study was a retrospective evaluation of 972 patients (719
   females and 253 males) with SS. Chromosomal analysis was performed on
   cultured peripheral lymphocytes.
   Results: The incidence of chromosome aberrations in males was 2.77\%
   (7/253) and in females 9.8\% (71/719). Several groups were made
   according to clinical features and familial antecedents of SS. We
   observed different incidence rates of chromosomal anomalies among groups
   of patients, mainly in females. The incidence in the group without
   familial antecedents was 18.89\%, however, in females with familial
   antecedents it was 4.45\%. In females with isolated SS we detected
   karyotype anomalies in the 3.98\%, while in patients with phenotypic
   features, amenorrhoea and SS the incidence was 77.78\%. In females the
   most frequent anomaly was Turner syndrome, present in 55 patients
   (77.46\%).
   Conclusion: Karyotype analysis is recommended for all girls with
   unexplained SS and associated abnormalities. In females with isolated SS
   a cost-benefit analysis must be done in each case.}},

   in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is highly
   susceptible to several biotic and abiotic stresses to which wild species
   are resistant. As a first step towards the introgression of these
   resistance genes into cultivated peanut, a linkage map based on
   microsatellite markers was constructed, using an F-2 population obtained
   from a cross between two diploid wild species with AA genome (A.
   duranensis and A. stenosperma). A total of 271 new microsatellite
   markers were developed in the present study from SSR-enriched genomic
   libraries, expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and by ``data-mining{''}
   sequences available in GenBank. Of these, 66 were polymorphic for
   cultivated peanut. The 271 new markers plus another 162 published for
   peanut were screened against both progenitors and 204 of these (47.1\%)
   were polymorphic, with 170 codominant and 34 dominant markers. The 80
   codominant markers segregating 1:2:1 (P < 0.05) were initially used to
   establish the linkage groups. Distorted and dominant markers were
   subsequently included in the map. The resulting linkage map consists of
   11 linkage groups covering 1,230.89 cM of total map distance, with an
   average distance of 7.24 cM between markers. This is the first
   microsatellite-based map published for Arachis, and the first map based
   on sequences that are all currently publicly available. Because most
   markers used were derived from ESTs and genomic libraries made using
   methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, about one-third of the mapped
   markers are genic. Linkage group ordering is being validated in other
   mapping populations, with the aim of constructing a transferable
   reference map for Arachis.}},

Abstract = {{The supernova remnant G347.3-0.5 (J1713.7 - 3946) is known as one of the
   unique SNRs that emit TeV gamma-rays, as well as nonthermal X-rays. We
   present a detailed study of molecular gas toward this SNR obtained with
   the 4 m millimeter and submillimeter telescope NANTEN at an angular
   resolution of 2.'6. This study has revealed that several intensity peaks
   and the overall distribution of the molecular gas with radial velocities
   from -12 to -3 km s(-1) show a remarkably good correlation with the
   X-ray features, strongly supporting the recently derived kinematic
   distance around 1 kpc, as opposed to the 6 kpc previously claimed. In
   addition, we show that absorption of X-rays is caused by local molecular
   gas at softer X-ray bands. Subsequent measurements of the submillimeter
   J = 3 2 transition of CO made with the ASTE 10 m and CSO 10.4 m
   submillimeter telescopes toward three of the molecular intensity peaks
   have revealed higher excitation conditions, most likely higher
   temperatures above similar to 30 K, in contrast to the typical gas
   temperature, 10 K, in low-mass dark clouds. This temperature rise is
   most likely caused by enhanced heating by the high-energy events in the
   SNR, where possible mechanisms include heating by X-rays, gamma-rays,
   and/or cosmic-ray protons, although we admit that additional radiative
   heating by young protostars embedded may be working as well. In one of
   the CO peaks, we have confirmed the presence of broad molecular wings of
   similar to 20 km s(-1) velocity extent in the CO J 3-2 transition. Two
   alternative interpretations for the wings are presented; one is shock
   acceleration by the blast wave, and the other is molecular outflow
   driven by an embedded protostar. The SNR evolution is well explained as
   the free expansion phase based on the distance of 1 kpc. The molecular
   data set should be valuable for making a further detailed comparison
   with the gamma-ray and X-ray distributions in order to examine the
   cosmic-ray acceleration quantitatively.}},

Abstract = {{Based on interviews with 18 UK women academics and managers on quality
   and power in higher education, this article interrogates the impact of
   quality assurance discourses and practices on women in higher education.
   Micro-level analysis of the effects of audit and the evaluative state
   seem to suggest that hegemonic masculinities and gendered power
   relations are being reinforced by the emphasis on competition, targets,
   audit trails and performance (Morley, 2003a). Furthermore, pedagogic
   space for exploring social justice issues is closing with the emphasis
   on learning outcomes and student consumerism ( Morley, 2003b). Yet women
   are also gaining new visibility as a consequence of the creation of a
   new cadre of quality managers. Quality assurance, as a regime of power,
   appears to offer both repressive and creative potential for women. This
   article will explore whether quality signs and practices are gendered
   and whether these represent opportunity or exploitation for women in the
   academy.}},

Abstract = {{Recent trauma literature has supported a philosophical shift from a
   pathogenic to a salutogenic paradigm in which the focus is on positive,

   exploring the different domains of positive change or posttraumatic
   growth (PTG) is scarce. The present study investigated the
   multidimensionality of PTG in Australian undergraduate students (N =
   219). Results indicated five factors for the Posttraumatic Growth
   Inventory, and moderate levels of PTG. Trauma severity was found to
   significantly predict PTG in addition to a positive correlation between
   PTG and negative posttrauma effects. While not negating negative effects
   of traumatic experiences, this area of traumatology research has
   important implications for redefining the ``victims{''} of trauma as
   individuals capable of positive change rather than merely surviving.}},

Abstract = {{Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by a neutrophil-dominated chronic
   inflammation of the airways with persistent infections. In order to
   investigate whether neutrophils contribute to an inadequacy in the
   pulmonary defence mechanism, the phagocytic activity of pulmonary and
   peripheral blood neutrophils from CF and non-CF respiratory patients
   were compared. Neutrophils were isolated from both the blood and
   bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 21 patients with CF (12 male, 9 female;
   mean age 7.5 years, range 0.25-16.4 years) and 17 non-CF subjects (9
   male, 8 female; mean age 5.4 years, range 0.2-13.1 years). The ex vivo
   phagocytic rate of normal pulmonary neutrophils to internalize zymosan
   particles opsonized with iC3b was faster than that of circulating
   neutrophils (P < 0.05), but the maximum capacity (9 particles/cell) was
   similar. In contrast, pulmonary neutrophils from patients with CF had a
   lower phagocytic capacity than circulating neutrophils either from the
   same patients or from normal subjects. This deficiency could not be
   attributed to (i) the cell surface density of CR3 (CD18/CD11b)
   receptors, which were not significantly different between the other
   groups (ii) the signalling ability of the CR3 receptors, using cytosolic
   free Ca2+ signalling as the receptor activity read-out or (iii) a
   decrease in cellular ATP concentration. As CFTR was not detectable on
   neutrophils from any source by either histochemistry or Western
   blotting, it was concluded that the reduced phagocytic capacity was not
   the direct result of a CFTR mutation, but was attributed to a failure of
   neutrophil phagocytic priming during translocation into the CF lung.}},

   atrioventricular (AV) block occurs more commonly in patients with DM. In
   this study, we evaluated any possible association between DM and
   third-degree AV block using International Classification of Diseases,
   Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes in a very large
   inpatient database.
   Method. We used patient treatment files containing discharge diagnoses
   using ICD-9 codes of inpatient treatment from all Veterans Health
   Administration hospitals. The cohort was stratified using the ICD-9-CM
   code for DM (n = 293,124), a control group with hypertension but no DM
   (n = 552,623), and the ICD-9 code for third-degree AV block (426.0) and
   smoking (305.1, V15.82). Nile performed multivariate analysis adjusting
   for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, smoking,and
   hyperlipidemia. Continuous and binary variables were analyzed using
   chi(2) and Fisher exacct tests.
   Results: Third-degree AV block diagnosis was present in 3,240 of DM
   patients (1.1\%) vs 3,367 patients (0.6\%) in the control group. Using
   multivariate analysis, DM remained strongly associated with third-degree
   AV block (odds ratio, 3.1; 95\% confidential interval, 3.0 to 3.3; p <
   0.0001).
   Conclusion: Third-degree AV block occurs significantly, more in patients
   with DM. This finding may, in part, explain die high cardiovascular
   mortality in DM patients.}},

Abstract = {{Goats have always been part of the fringes of agriculture in the UK.
   They were probably introduced by the Romans 2000 years ago. During the
   middle ages they were seen as undesirable probably because they did not
   conform with the new agricultural revolution. Since those times and in
   fact as recently as the last 30 years there has been an increase in
   interest in goat production which as may be expected has followed
   increased market possibilities for the products. This paper briefly
   describes the background to the current situation where a small but
   efficient dairy goat industry has developed and where a range of
   products are now made and are marketed through various outlets from
   small specialist cheese shops to the major super market chains. Some of
   the strategies that have lead to successful marketing are examined and
   also the part that legislation has played in these developments is also
   considered. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment with deferoxamine (DFO) is protective against focal ischemia
   with global hypoxia when given as a preconditioning stimulus in neonatal
   rodents. DFO acts as an iron chelator and may stabilize HIF1 alpha.
   Therefore, we hypothesized that DFO would protect against pure
   ischemia-reperfusion injury when given after the insult and that the
   protection would be associated with expression of hypoxia-inducible
   factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) and downstream target genes such as
   erythropoietin (Epo). To test these hypotheses, we performed middle
   cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in postnatal day 10 (P10) rats for 1.5 h
   followed by treatment with DFO or vehicle upon reperfusion. Preserved
   brain volumes were measured with cresyl violet staining 1 week after the
   insult. HIF1 alpha and Epo expression were determined by Western blot
   and immumocytochemical analyses at different time points after injury.
   We found that DFO treatment preserved brain volumes when compared to
   vehicle (P < 0.05). In DFO-treated ischemic cortices, HIF1 alpha
   expression peaked early, while Epo expression was seen in two phases and
   in different cell populations. Epo immunoreactivity colocalized with
   neuronal markers at 8 h but with astrocytic markers at 1 week. These
   results suggest that DFO is protective when administered after neonatal
   ischemic stroke and that this protection may be like that afforded by
   preconditioning through the upregulation of similar downstream pathways.

   that making the critical lure inconspicuous did not significantly
   increase false recall. However, the proportion of falsely recalled
   Critical Lures was significantly lower and the proportion Of Critical
   lures produced on a postrecall test (asking participants to report items
   that they had thought of but did not recall) was significantly higher
   when they spontaneously realized the nature of false memory
   manipulation. However, there was no effect on veridical recall of study

Abstract = {{Background: Currently clinicians and researchers in Pakistan have to use
   translated western instruments to screen for anxiety and depressive
   disorders. This study investigated the local idioms of emotional
   distress in Pakistan to develop a culturally valid and easy-to-use
   instrument to screen for common mental disorders in general clinical
   settings.
   Methods: A systematic survey was conducted of psychiatric case notes of
   patients attending clinics in Peshawar and Lahore, diagnosed with
   anxiety or depressive disorders, to identify the range of common idioms
   of psychological distress. A pilot version of the questionnaire was
   refined and validated among a composite sample of 330 patients in
   inpatient, outpatient and rural community settings. ICD-10 Diagnostic
   Criteria for Research were used to define cases and patients' relatives
   acted as normal controls.
   Results: The pilot version of the questionnaire was reduced to 42 items
   based on odds ratios between cased and controls. Anxiety symptoms were
   generally reported by depressed patients, but not vice versa. Finally 30
   items were selected, in two subscales. This final version achieved
   sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predicted values of
   over 90\% when comparing cases and controls.
   Limitations: This questionnaire was based on what patients tell doctors
   and may not capture the entire repertoire of local idioms of distress.
   The validation study was conducted only in an Urdu/Punjabi speaking
   population, in Lahore and surrounding areas.
   Conclusions: The Pakistan Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire consists
   of an anxiety/depression scale and a depression scale, each of 15 items.
   It demonstrates excellent validity as screening instrument for anxiety
   and depressive disorders in clinical settings in Pakistan. (c) 2005

   different O-2(g), Pt/YSZ electrochemical half cells were prepared as
   simple models of gas-electrodes. One of them had a working electrode
   which was composed of uniformly distributed platinum; the other had an
   island-networked platinum electrode. On the former electrode, PM-IRRAS
   detected a concentration change of adsorbed oxygen on Pt electrode with
   controlled cathodic overpotential. On the other hand, for the latter
   sample that showed smaller cathodic current, the signal of the adsorbed
   oxygen was suppressed by SiO2 impurity, whose spectrum was detected at
   1220 cm(-1) by PM-IRRAS. It was shown that PM-IRRAS gives useful

Abstract = {{Daily restraint for 3 weeks was shown to atrophy dendrites of
   hippocampal pyramidal neurons in rats. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
   (BDNF), which maintains neuronal survival and morphology, has been shown
   to decrease in response to acute stress. Plasma glucocorticoid (GC) and
   serotonergic projections from the raphe nuclei play major roles in
   reducing BDNF synthesis in the hippocampus. We investigated BDNF mRNA
   levels there, together with plasma GC levels, GC receptors in the
   hippocampus/hypothalamus and 5-HT synthesizing enzyme, tryptophan
   hydroxylase in the raphe nuclei, in animals chronically stressed for 1-3
   weeks, using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In these
   animals, BDNF mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the
   hippocampus after 6 h of restraint, but the ability of restraint to
   reduce BDNF synthesis seemed less robust than that seen in acute stress
   models. HPA axis response to stress in these animals assessed by plasma
   GC levels was delayed and sustained, and the GC receptor in the
   paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus was increased at I week. Tryptophan
   hydroxylase immunoreactivity was increased in the median raphe nucleus
   at 2-3 weeks. Repetitive stress-induced reduction of BDNF may partly
   contribute to the neuronal atrophy/death and reduction of hippocampal
   volume observed both in animals and humans suffering chronic stress
   and/or depression. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan

Abstract = {{Despite the absence of a conspicuous microtubule-organizing centre,
   microtubules in plant cells at interphase are present in the cell cortex
   as a well oriented array(1,2). A recent report suggests that microtubule
   nucleation sites for the array are capable of associating with and
   dissociating from the cortex(3). Here, we show that nucleation requires
   extant cortical microtubules, onto which cytosolic gamma-tubulin is
   recruited. In both living cells and the cell-free system, microtubules
   are nucleated as branches on the extant cortical microtubules. The
   branch points contain gamma-tubulin, which is abundant in the cytoplasm,
   and microtubule nucleation in the cell-free system is prevented by
   inhibiting gamma-tubulin function with a specific antibody. When
   isolated plasma membrane with microtubules is exposed to purified
   neuro-tubulin, no microtubules are nucleated. However, when the membrane
   is exposed to a cytosolic extract, gamma-tubulin binds microtubules on
   the membrane, and after a subsequent incubation in neuro-tubulin,
   microtubules are nucleated on the pre-existing microtubules. We propose
   that a cytoplasmic gamma-tubulin complex shuttles between the cytoplasm
   and the side of a cortical microtubule, and has nucleation activity only
   when bound to the microtubule.}},

Abstract = {{The developmental rate of a blastocyst is considered one of the main
   estimates for evaluating the implantation potential of embryos. Day 6
   blastocysts have been reported to be much less viable than day 5
   blastocysts. Regarding implantation, the implantation window is advanced
   due to a background of high sex hormones, and slower growing embryos may
   not implant because of possible desynchrony with the implantation
   window. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of
   cryopreservation of such embryos and subsequent synchronization of
   embryo transfer with endometrial status. The results of 122 day 6
   blastocysts transferred in the clinic were retrospectively examined.
   Pregnancy rates were compared between the stimulation cycle and hormone
   replacement cycle in terms of the method of endometrial preparation.
   Fifty-five day 6 blastocysts were transferred onto the stimulation cycle
   endometrium in 37 women, resulting in a 5.5\% viable pregnancy rate. On
   the other hand, 67 day 6 blastocysts were transferred onto endometrium
   prepared by exogenous hormones in 40 women, resulting in a 26.9\% viable
   pregnancy rate (P < 0.01). Consequently, the difference was highly
   significant. In conclusion, synchronous transfer of slow-growing embryos
   using the freeze-thaw technique contributes to a positive outcome.}},

   schools where none existed, struggled against the perpetuation of
   unequal educational environments, or built viable alternative schools.
   Motivated by the belief that education would ``uplift the race,{''}

Abstract = {{Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major public health problem in Egypt
   due to the high prevalence of hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection. The
   mechanism by which HCV exerts its carcinogenic effect on the liver is
   not yet understood. Previous research has suggested that perturbations
   of the Fas-Fas L tumor necrosis system could result in uncontrolled
   cancerous cell growth in the liver. This study aims to assess the
   relationship of Fas ligand (Fas L) to HCC. A total of 28 cases (HCC) and
   56 controls (28 cirrhosis and 28 chronic hepatitis) were included in the
   study. Sera and tissue biopsies were tested for HCV antibody and
   HCV-RNA. Fas ligand expression in tissue was examined
   immunohistochemically using a rabbit purified polyclonal antibody.
   Levels of soluble Fas L were determined in serum by ELISA. The HCC cases
   were graded as: 17.9\% Grade I, 32.1\% Grade II, 35.7\% Grade III and
   14.3\% were Grade IV. Among the cases, 81\% had evidence of cirrhosis.
   All the cases and controls were positive for HCV-RNA. Tissue and serum
   PCR results were identical within the same subjects. Fas ligand
   cytoplasmic expression was more pronounced in HCC than in cirrhosis, and
   in cirrhosis more than in chronic hepatitis. This expression was higher
   with increasing grades of malignancy and in tissues adjacent to the
   tumor, than in those without nearby tumor. Soluble Fas L levels were
   higher in cases than in controls, with similar results as that of
   immunohistochemical expression. These results suggest that HCV and Fas
   ligand play a key role in hepatocarcinogenesis, consistent with the
   hypothesis that HCV induces overexpression of Fas ligand in the liver
   cells, resulting in escape from killing by the immune system cells, with
   subsequent uncontrolled growth of tissue and the development of
   malignancy. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aim: As biotechnology continues to advance, a bioartificial
   liver is expected to be developed for the treatment of patients with
   fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) whose liver dysfunction is potentially
   reversible or for providing liver support as a bridge to liver
   transplantation. While monolayer-cultured hepatocytes rapidly lose their
   capacity to express many liver-specific functions over time when
   cultured, spherical-shaped hepatocytes in three-dimensional culture with
   the use of extracellular matrix components sustain long-term survival by
   maintaining differentiated hepatocyte functions. The aim of this study
   was to investigate whether sufficient functions of viable
   spherical-shaped hepatocytes could be maintained in plasma of patients
   with FHF in order to use these cells in an extracorporeal system.
   Methods: Hepatocyte functions were evaluated under monolayer or
   three-dimensional culture in FHF plasma. Results: Primary rat
   hepatocytes on poly-N-p-vinylbenzyl-D-lactonamide (PVLA) formed
   spheroids even in FHF plasma and maintained their spherical shapes in
   FHF plasma as long as in medium. Spherical-shaped hepatocytes on PVLA
   cultured in FHF plasma showed higher activity in albumin secretion, urea
   formation, and gluconeogenesis than those in normal human plasma or
   medium. As being cultured in medium, hepatocytes on PVLA cultured in
   plasma were also superior to cells on collagen in regard to albumin
   secretion, amino acid metabolism, and gluconeogenesis. Conclusions:
   These findings demonstrated that FHF plasma is not toxic to rat
   hepatocyte spheroids and that hepatocyte spheroids have potential use in
   the development of a bioartificial liver.}},

Abstract = {{Rubberwood samples were chemically modified using a two-step reaction.
   The wood was esterified with two different dicarboxylic acid anhydrides,
   namely, maleic anhydride and phthalic anhydride and subsequently treated
   with epichlorohydrin to obtain oligoesterified wood. The treated wooden
   blocks were assessed for bio-resistance against white and brown rot
   fungi. Maleic anhydride alone treated samples showed resistance only for
   the brown rot attack but failed to protect against the white rot fungi.
   Except for the maleic anhydride treatment, other treatments showed a
   weight loss of less than 10\%. All these treatments can be taken as
   effective treatments for rubberwood. However, the best effect was shown
   in the combination of phthalic anhydride and epichlorohydrin. This
   technique was found to be promising as an environmental-friendly method
   to protect rubberwood against decay fungi and to provide dimensional
   stability required for better uses of timber. This treatment helps to
   promote the use of low quality timber such as rubberwood, which is a

Title = {{Volatile anesthetics bind rat synaptic snare proteins}},
Journal = {{ANESTHESIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{768-778}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Volatile general anesthetics (VAs) have a number of synaptic
   actions, one of which is to inhibit excitatory neurotransmitter release;
   however, no presynaptic VA binding proteins have been identified.
   Genetic data in Caenorhabditis elegans have led to the hypothesis that a
   protein that interacts with the presynaptic protein syntaxin 1A is a VA
   target. Motivated by this hypothesis, the authors measured the ability
   of syntaxin IA and proteins that interact with syntaxin to bind to
   halothane and isoflurane.
   Methods: Recombinant rat syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25B, VAMP2, and the ternary
   SNARE complex that they form were tested. Binding of VAs to these
   proteins was detected by F-19-nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation
   measurements. Structural alterations in the proteins were examined by
   circular dichroism and ability to form complexes.
   Results: Volatile anesthetics did not bind to VAMP2. At concentrations
   in the clinical range, VAs did bind to SNA-P-25B; however, binding was
   detected only in preparations containing SNAP-25B homomultimers. VAs
   also bound at clinical concentrations to both syntaxin and the SNARE
   complex. Addition of an N-terminal His(6) tag to syntaxin abolished its
   ability to bind VAs despite normal secondary structure and ability to
   form SNARE complexes; thrombin cleavage of the tag restored VA binding.
   Thus, the VA binding site(s) has structural requirements and is not
   simply any a-helical bundle. VAs at supraclinical concentrations
   produced an increase in helicity of the SNARE complex; otherwise, VA
   binding produced no gross alteration in the stability or secondary
   structure of the SNARE complex.
   Conclusion: SNARE proteins are potential synaptic targets of volatile
   anesthetics.}},

Abstract = {{Using the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (Gross-Pitaevskii equation),

   a hard-walled obstacle of finite size. We explore the splitting of the
   wave packet and its reorganization to form an interference ;pattern.
   Particular attention is paid to the role of gravity (g) and repulsive
   nonlinearity (u(0)) in the fringe pattern. The peak-to-peak distance in
   the fringe pattern and the number of interference peaks are found to be
   proportional to g(-1/2) and u(0)(1/2) g(1/4) respectively. We Suggest a

   The low temperature structures have been revealed to have two

   axis. The structural changes of the dimers have been analyzed by
   calculations of overlap integrals, to show that the degree of the
   dimerization changes through the phase transitions. This indicates that

Abstract = {{Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways represent a
   cascade of phosphorylation events, including three pivotal kinases, Raf,
   MEK and ERK1/2, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
   cancer. We examined 151 cases of invasive breast carcinoma by
   immunohistochemistry and compared the ERK2 expression with
   clinicopathological parameters, MMP-11 immunoexpression and patients'
   survival. ERK2 immunoexpression was detected in the cytoplasm and
   nucleus of cancer cells in 37.7\% and 19.2\% of cases, respectively.
   Nuclear ERK2 was inversely correlated with ER (p=0.039), whereas
   cytoplasmic ERK2 was positively correlated with MMP-11 in fibroblasts
   (p=0.032) and more often expressed in lobular than ductal carcinomas
   (p=0.026). Nuclear ERK2 expression was found to be an independent
   prognostic factor of shortened overall survival of patients (p=0.040),
   while cytoplasmic ERK2 had an independent, favorable effect on both
   disease-free and overall survival (p < 0.0001 and p=0.002,
   respectively). These findings suggest that the different subcellular
   localizations of ERK2 seem to be related to different, possibly
   contradictory, effects on patient survival.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory
   polyneuropathy related to autoimmunity. However, no conclusive
   etiological concept has yet been found. We examined the variation in
   autoantibodies to lipids in serum of GBS patients in response to the
   course of the disease but investigated titer modifications during
   treatment with gamma-globulin. Design and setting: Prospective clinical
   study in a 14-bed general ICU. Patients: Nine patients with GBS and nine
   controls were included in the study. Measurements and results: Four
   blood samples were obtained before and after treatment. Serum samples,
   diluted 1:60, were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgM,
   IgA, and IgG antibodies to phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol,
   cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine,
   phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and
   gangliosides. Anti-phospholipid antibodies of the IgM, IgA, and IgG
   families were detected in all GBS patients but in none of the controls.
   Phosphatidylinositol, cardiolipin, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidic
   acid were the main antigens. All patients developed
   anti-phosphatidylinositol antibodies of the IgM family and
   anti-cardiolipin antibodies of the IgA and IgG families. A decrease in
   the level of anti-phospholipid autoantibodies was observed after 1 day
   of treatment with gamma-globulin. Two days after ending gamma-globulin
   administration the IgG antibodies increased again. Conclusions: Our
   findings suggest that in GBS there is an extensive immune reaction,
   which is altered after gamma-globulin treatment. Anti-cardiolipin and
   anti-phosphatidylinositol antibodies could be useful markers for the
   response to treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The present study reports the cytoprotective and antioxidant properties
   of alcoholic leaf extract of seabuckthorn (SBT) against hypoxia induced

   mitochondrial transmembrane potential compared to the controls. Further
   an appreciable increase in nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) production was noted which in turn was responsible for fall in
   intracellular antioxidant levels and GSH/GSSG ratio. There was a
   significant increase in DNA damage during hypoxia as revealed by comet
   assay. Pretreatment of cells with alcoholic leaf extract of SBT at 200
   mu g/ml significantly inhibited cytotoxicity, ROS production and
   maintained antioxidant levels similar to that of control cells. Further,
   the leaf extract restored the mitochondrial integrity and prevented the
   DNA damage induced by hypoxia. These results indicate that the leaf

Abstract = {{The purpose of this retrospective study was to test whether the initial
   pattern of clinical presentation of shoe dermatitis could indicate the
   causative allergen(s) and to estimate the odds on foot dermatitis in
   patients with a positive patch test versus those with a negative

   tested with the standard series (and additional allergens, if
   appropriate). Of them, 1168 (14\%) had been referred because of foot
   dermatitis and 474 of these patients (5.5\% of the total group)
   presented a positive reaction to one or more substances related to
   shoes. We found that 6 standard allergens in the male group and 8
   standard allergens in the female group were statistically significant
   for the shoe dermatitis group. The data showed a relationship between
   the distribution pattern of the foot lesions and most of the allergens.
   These results have clinical applications since the gender of the
   patients and the localization of the foot eruptions can, indeed,
   indicate what allergen is involved.}},

Title = {{The shortened dental arch - an assessment of patients' dental health
   state utility values}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL DENTAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{307-312}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine how patients value
   the potential outcomes from different treatments for the shortened
   dental arch (SDA). Methods: 110 partially dentate patients were
   interviewed and presented with illustrative models as well as a
   description of the process and likely outcome of six possible treatments
   for the shortened dental arch. The patients were asked to indicate on a
   standardised visual analogue scale how they would value the health of
   their mouth if they had received each of the treatments described.
   Results: With a utility value of 0.0 representing the worst possible
   health state for a mouth and 1.0 representing the best, the mean utility
   value for `no treatment' for a SDA was 0.28 (sd=0.29). For a
   cobalt-chromium based removable partial denture, an acrylic-resin based
   removable partial denture, implant treatment, a resin-bonded
   cantilevered bridge and a conventional cantilevered fixed bridge the
   utility values were 0.42 (sd=0.3), 0.49 (sd=0.31), 0.53 (sd=0.35), 0.63
   (sd=0.26) and 0.64 (sd=0.28) respectively. Conclusions: The treatment
   outcome from a cantilevered bridge attracted the highest mean utility
   value. Participants did not value implant treatment as highly as fixed
   bridgework, but they did rate the utility of implants more highly than
   the utility value of removable dentures. However, the patients placed a
   very low value on the outcome from `no' treatment. Thus, the
   appropriateness of the shortened dental arch as an oral health goal can
   be questioned.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. - To describe principles and characteristics of mental health care
   in Madrid.
   Method. - Based on existing data, service provision, number of
   professionals working in services, funding arrangements, pathways into
   care, user/carer involvement and specific issues are reported.
   Results. - In Madrid, mental health services are organized into 11
   zones/areas, divided into 36 districts, where there is a mental health
   outpatient service with a multi-disciplinary team. Home treatment and
   psychosocial rehabilitation services have been developed. Specialist
   programmes exist for vulnerable client groups, including Children and
   Adolescents, Addiction/Alcohol and Older People. The Madrid Mental
   Health Plan (2003-2008) is regarded as the key driver in implementing
   service improvement and increased mental health and well-being in
   Madrid. It has a meant global budget increase of more than 10\% for
   mental health services. Results of the first 2 years are: an increase in
   mental health staff employed (17\%), four new hospitalization units,
   50\% increase in places for children and adolescents Day Hospitals, 62
   new beds in long care residential units, development of specific
   programmes for the homeless and gender-based violence, a significant
   investment in information systems (450 new computers) and development of
   best practice and operational guidelines. Mental health system was put
   to the test with Madrid's March 11th terrorist attack. A Special Mental
   Health Plan for Affected people was developed.
   Discussion. - Unlike some European countries, public mental health
   service is the main heath care provider. There are no voluntary agencies
   collaborating with mental health care. Continuity of care and
   coordination between all mental health resources is essential in service
   delivery. Increased demand of care for minor psychiatric disorders,
   children and adolescent mental health care, and implementation of
   rehabilitation and residential facilities for chronic patients are
   outstanding challenges similar to those in other European capitals.
   Overall, the mental health system had successfully coped with last
   year's increased care demand after March 11th terrorist attack in
   Madrid. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the incidence of
   congenital penile anomalies (CPA), particularly hypospadias, is
   increasing. This phenomenon has significant biological and socioeconomic
   implications. We sought further confirmation of the reported trends
   using a large national database.
   Materials and Methods: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample is a 20\% sample
   of United States hospitals containing data on 5 to 7 million hospital
   inpatient stays per year. We identified male newborns, used ICD-9 codes
   to identify newborns with CPA, determined nationally weighted incidence
   over time and performed multivariate analyses to identify factors
   associated with CPA.
   Results: Of the 4.84 million male newborns in the Nationwide Inpatient
   Sample we identified 37,577 with CPA (weighted incidence rate 7.8/1000
   newborns). The weighted incidence increased from 7.0/1000 newborns in
   1988 to 1991 to 8.3/1000 in 1997 to 2000 (p < 0.0001). The most common

   hypospadias plus chordee (5\%). Unspecified genital or penile anomalies
   were reported for 14\% of the cases. The highest incidence of CPA was in
   white newborns (9.2/1000), followed by black newborns (7.5/1000), Asians
   (5.0/1000) and Hispanics (4.7/1000) (p < 0.0001). Socioeconomic status
   (SES) was strongly associated with CPA, with CPA odds 19\% higher for
   the highest SES category versus the lowest (OR 1.18, 95\% CI 1.16-1.20).
   Increasing incidence of CPA over time was observed even after adjusting
   for race/ethnicity, geographic region, insurance status and SES.
   Conclusions: These nationally representative, weighted analyses reveal a
   significant increase in the incidence of CPA, with striking variation by
   race, region and SES. Further research into potential causes, as well as
   the observed disparities in incidence, is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In children with severe unilateral reflux nephropathy and
   diminished relative renal function (RRF) a dilemma exists between the
   choice of treatment with ureteral reimplantation or nephrectomy. Limited
   followup data are available regarding relative renal function or
   postoperative complications after ureteral reimplantation in kidneys
   with significant unilateral reflux nephropathy.
   Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 460
   patients who underwent ureteral reimplantation between 1980 and 2002,
   and identified children with primary vesicoureteral reflux and severe
   unilateral reflux nephropathy (RRF 30\% or less on renal scintigraphy).
   The postoperative outcomes were assessed for relative renal function and
   complications including hypertension, pyelonephritis or persistent
   reflux.
   Results: A total of 18 girls and 14 boys with a mean preoperative
   relative renal function of 20.1 +/- 7.8\% (range 2\% to 30\%) met the
   inclusion criteria. Reflux grade in the poorly functioning kidney was II
   in 4 children (13\%), III in 14 (44\%), IV in 11 (34\%) and V in 3
   (9\%). Reflux was unilateral in 15 children (47\%) and bilateral in 17
   (53\%). Mean followup from surgery was 3.7 years (range 0.3 to 12.9). In
   28 children with both preoperative and postoperative renal scans, mean
   preoperative RRF was 20.3 +/- 7.4\% and mean postoperative RRF was 20.5
   +/- 8.6\% with a mean time between renal scans of 2.3 years. No
   statistically significant change was noted from preoperative to
   postoperative relative renal function with a mean change of +0.2 +/-
   3.7\% (range -6.5\% to +10\%, p=0.82). Postoperative complications
   occurred in 7 of the 32 children (22\%), including hypertension (1),
   pyelonephritis (3) and persistent reflux (4). Pyelonephritis occurred in
   1 child with persistent reflux. No statistically significant difference
   existed in mean preoperative relative renal function between those with
   and without complications (24.6 +/- 8.9\% vs 18.8 +/- 7.2\%, p = 0.09).
   Conclusions: Children who underwent ureteral reimplantation in
   association with unilateral reflux nephropathy maintained stable
   relative renal function.}},

Abstract = {{Productivity of remote workers is of critical concern to organizations
   and managers contemplating telecommuting arrangements. Here we suggest a
   general theoretical framework for understanding telecommuter
   productivity, and then report on a two-phased research study. In the
   first phase, semi-structured interviews with 32 telecommuters were
   conducted in one organization, and individual, social, and situational
   factors associated with telecommuter productivity were qualitatively
   explored. The second phase involved a survey of 100 telecommuters in two
   organizations, followed by predictive discriminant analyses to identify
   factors that might usefully distinguish between telecommuters exhibiting
   low and high levels of productivity. Results indicate that telecommuter
   beliefs and attitudes, and the quality of their social interactions with
   managers and family members, were strongly associated with productivity.
   Furthermore, telecommuters' social interactions with colleagues,
   managers, and family members had a strong influence on their beliefs and
   attitudes about telecommuting. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All tights

Abstract = {{A failure of human foveal development only occurs in two genetically
   determined conditions; aniridia (Pax6 mutation) and albinism (tyrosinase
   mutation). The chiasmatic pathways from this region are disrupted in
   albinism and central retinal blood vessel patterns are abnormal. It is
   assumed that these three abnormalities have a common mechanism. Here we
   investigate whether similar abnormalities are present in subjects with
   aniridia. Using fundus photographs it is shown that abnormal blood
   vessel patterns are present in aniridia, but these significantly differ
   from those in albinos. Using electrophysiological techniques, abnormal
   hemispheric projections through the chiasm are demonstrated in albinos,
   but aniridics do not differ from normal subjects. These results
   demonstrate that although mutations in Pax6 and tyrosinase both affect
   central retinal development, they have a fundamentally different impact
   on the formation of the retinal vasculature and the projections from
   this region. This strongly suggests that separate mechanisms regulate
   the development of the central retina and decussation patterns at the
   optic chiasm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new approach allowing efficient and semi-automatic
   object-based manipulation for video editing or post-production
   applications, such as the modification of the trajectories of video
   objects in a natural scene. For that purpose, an image is seen as a
   superposition of video object planes (VOP) on an original image or a
   mosaic view of a fixed background. The method is based on the definition
   of an editing scenario which contains all the information required to
   create the edited sequence. A warping model is used to represent the
   location and the modification of the video object in the 2-D scene. Such
   an application is by nature semi-automatic since the operator has to
   specify the modifications that he wants to perform on the original
   sequence. The proposed method has been designed in order to reduce as
   much as possible the human workload by using the notion of key VOP and
   by calibrating in depth the fixed background area. Experimental results
   show that a high level of realism can be obtained on edited images in
   which the original trajectories of non-rigid video objects have been
   strongly modified. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Consequences of transient faults represent a significant problem for
   today's electronic circuits and systems. As the probability of such
   errors increases, incorporation of error detection and correction
   mechanisms is mandatory. It is well known that traditional techniques
   that validate system's reliability do not cover the whole spectrum of
   fault scenarios, because fault models are linked to target
   architectures. Therefore, validating the completeness of robust fault
   tolerance techniques is a major issue when assessing reliability
   improvements these techniques can produce. In this paper, we propose an
   original approach to evaluate the system reliability with respect to
   Single Event Upset (SEU) errors. It is based on model-checking
   principles. In addition, a signature analysis technique is evaluated.
   This technique was previously validated using a simulation-based fault
   injection approach. Simulation results showed that no error escapes
   detection. However, simulation based fault injection cannot guarantee
   that all fault consequences have been investigated. This limitation
   motivates us to explore a formal verification approach that targets a
   complete validation. Model checking has a fundamental advantage over
   classic fault-injection techniques: it can cover all possible SEU fault
   scenarios from a predefined class. Results reported in this paper
   demonstrate the efficiency of this validation approach over usual
   simulation-based techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The absorption spectra of two photoactive yellow protein model
   chromophores have been measured in vacuum using an electrostatic ion
   storage ring. The absorption spectrum of the isolated chromophore is an
   important reference for deducing the influence of the protein
   environment on the electronic energy levels of the chromophore and
   separating the intrinsic properties of the chromophore from properties
   induced by the protein environment. In vacuum the deprotonated
   transthiophenyl-p-coumarate model chromophore has an absorption maximum
   at 460 nm, whereas the photoactive yellow protein absorbs maximally at
   446 nm. The protein environment thus only slightly blue-shifts the
   absorption. In contrast, the absorption of the model chromophore in
   aqueous solution is significantly blue-shifted (lambda(max) 395 nm). A
   deprotonated trans-p-coumaric acid has also been studied to elucidate
   the effect of thioester formation and phenol deprotonation. The sum of
   these two changes on the chromophore induces a red shift both in vacuum
   and in aqueous solution.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The goal of this study was to assess determinants for
   treatment outcome in unilateral cleft lip and palate, evaluated
   according to the Great Ormond Street London and Oslo (GOSLON) Yardstick
   and 5-year-index ratings by means of a meta-analysis.
   Methods: Multiple databases were searched for publications in which
   patient groups were evaluated by GOSLON ranking or the GOSLON-like
   5-year index. From the 15 selected publications, the following
   background variables could be extracted and were evaluated as
   determinants for treatment outcome in unilateral cleft lip and palate:
   year of birth, average age of the patient at the time of GOSLON
   classification, racial background, presence of Simonart's band, infant
   orthopedics, palatal closure before the age of 3 versus palatal closure
   at a later age, bone graft, and number of surgeons.
   Results: The total number of patients included in the meta-analysis was
   1236. Patients whose soft and hard palate were closed before the age of
   3 presented significantly poorer (p = 0.003) GOSLON scores (mean score,
   2.9; SD 0.4) than patients whose palate was closed at a later age (mean
   GOSLON score, 2.3; SD 0.2).
   Conclusions: Delayed palatal closure generally results in better dental
   arch relationships than early palatal closure. Well-designed, randomized
   clinical trials are required for further investigation of the optimal
   timing for palatal closure.}},

Abstract = {{The IS process to produce hydrogen from water requires efficient
   separation procedures. Effects of three typical membrane techniques (an
   electro-electrodialysis (EED), an electrochemical cell (EC), a hydrogen

   evaluated by heat/mass balance calculations based on the experimental
   data. The EED to concentrate HI solution is the most important membrane
   technique to obtain high thermal efficiency among the three techniques.
   The maximum thermal efficiency was 40.8\% at 12.5 mol kg(-H2O)(-1) of HI
   molality after the EED. The second important technique is the EC at the
   reaction of H2O, SO2 and I-2. The maximum thermal efficiency was 38.9\%
   at 15.3 mol kg(-H20)(-1), of H2SO4 molality after the EC. The HPMR at
   the decomposition reaction of HI was effective to improve one pass
   conversion of HI to 76.4\%, and the amounts of recycled HI was reduced
   by 91.5\% using this membrane technique. The required heat at the
   reactor was small compared with that at the EED or at the EC. Total
   thermal efficiency was improved only 0.7\% by the application of the
   HPMR. (c) 2004 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published

Abstract = {{Objective: Chronic heart failure is associated with neurohormonal
   activation that is not only, related to outcome but is also a
   therapeutic target. We have attempted to demonstrate whether a similar
   pattern of neurohormonal activation exists in adult congenital heart
   disease (ACHD) and, if so, whether it relates to disease severity
   determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
   Methods and results: Concentrations of N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic
   peptide, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP),
   endothelin (ET)-1, renin, aldosterone, adrenalin, and noradrenalin were
   determined in 50 adults (mean age, 27.8 +/- 1.7 years {[}+/- SEM]; 26
   women) with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) after surgical repair (New York
   Heart Association functional class 1.1 +/- 0.1). One hundred age- and
   sex-matched healthy blood donors served as a control group for NT-proBNP
   determination. Dimensions of ventricles, left ventricular pump function,
   and estimated right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure were determined
   by, echocardiography. Maximum oxygen uptake (Vo(2)max) was measured in
   all patients using spiroergometry. TOF patients had elevated levels of
   NT-proBNP compared with health,, individuals: NT-proBNP (women: 180
   pg/mL vs 43 pg/mL, and men: 147 pg/mL vs 32 pg/mL; p < 0.0001) and ET-1
   (2.5 fmol/L vs 0.7 fmol/L). There was a significant correlation of
   NT-proBNP to dimension and estimated peak systolic pressure of the RV as
   well as impairment of Vo(2)max.
   Conclusions: RV dysfunction detected by echocardiography and plasma
   NT-proBNP determination in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic TOF
   patients correlates well with their cardiopulmonary exercise capacity.
   Thus, these simple and noninvasive screening methods can be used
   additionally to stratify ACHD patients with impaired cardiac function
   before they become clinically symptomatic.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To evaluate common methods of investigation and treatment in
   children younger than 2 y of age with eczema, with or without
   sensitization to food allergens. Methods: One hundred and twenty-three
   children younger than 2 y of age with eczema and suspected food allergy
   were included in this prospective study. The children underwent
   skin-prick test with cow's milk, fresh hen's egg white and wheat.
   Specific IgE to milk and egg white was analysed. The eczema extent and
   severity was estimated with SCORAD before and after treatment. Children
   with a positive skin-prick test were instructed to exclude that food
   item from their diet. All children were treated with emollients and
   topical steroids when needed. Results: Sixty-two of the children were
   skin-prick positive to at least one of the allergens; 62\% had mild,
   30\% moderate and 8\% severe eczema at their first visit. After
   treatment, 90\% had mild, 10\% moderate and 0\% severe eczema. Forty-six
   per cent of the children had circulating IgE antibodies to milk or egg
   white. Ten per cent had specific IgE but negative skin-prick test to the
   same allergen. This subgroup improved their eczema significantly without
   elimination diet.
   Conclusion: The conventional treatments for children with eczema, i.e.
   skin care and food elimination, are effective. The beneficial effect of
   skin care as the first step should not be neglected, and it may not be
   necessary to eliminate food allergens to relieve skin symptoms in all
   food-sensitized children with eczema.}},

Abstract = {{High intraocular pressure (IOP)-induced ischemia is a model for retinal
   neurodegeneration that recapitulates pathological features almost
   identical to those seen in patients after central retinal or ophthalmic
   artery occlusion and may also represent a model of acute angle closure
   glaucoma. Using this experimental model, we present data indicating that
   acute IOP elevation for 45 min is followed by a progressive decline in
   the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) which appear to die via an
   apoptotic mechanism. The observation that systemic treatment with MK801,
   a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, with GYKI52466, a
   non-NMDA receptor antagonist, or with L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric
   oxide synthase (NOS), prevents the RGC loss observed 24 after IOP
   elevation strongly suggests an excitotoxic, glutamate-mediated,
   mechanism of RGC death. The latter deduction is strengthened by the
   evidence that a microdialysis probe placed into the retinal tissue of
   rats bearing IOP elevation revealed an increase (90\% as compared to
   baseline value) in glutamate levels that peaked 130 min after the
   beginning of reperfusion and was reversed by a pretreatment with MK801.
   Collectively, our data suggest that acute elevation of IOP increases
   intraretinal levels of glutamate with consequent abnormal activation of
   NMDA and non-NMDA subtypes of glutamate receptors and increased NOS
   activity leading to excitotoxic, glutamate-mediated, RGC death. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Purpose: We evaluated the outcome of postpubertal patients who underwent
   1-stage hypospadias repair before onset of puberty with at least 10
   years of followup.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 2,053 patients underwent surgical
   repair of hypospadias between January 1981 and May 2004 at our hospital.
   We evaluated patients who are now at least 18 years old and who
   underwent 1-stage hypospadias repair. Data were collected in regard to
   familial incidence, age at operation, operative technique, complications
   and followup of at least 10 years. Evaluation was subdivided based on
   operative procedure.
   Results: A total of 126 patients were included in the study. The
   familial incidence was 7.9\% of cases and an associated undescended
   testis was seen in 9.5\%. There were 62 cases with no complications. At
   least 1 complication was seen in 64 cases, including infection in 3,
   tissue necrosis in the operative area in 3, wound dehiscence in 6,
   fistula in 29, meatal stenosis in 15, urethral stenosis in 10, cosmetic
   dissatisfaction in 16 and other in 2.
   Conclusions: Even in the hands of the experienced pediatric urologists
   the complication rate after hypospadias repair remains high, with an
   average of 54\% at long-term followup. Our results clearly showed that
   additional complications can present after long-term followup (a first
   complication can present after more than 5 years with the longest
   interval being 14 years). Therefore, final outcome of hypospadias
   surgery can only be evaluated once the patient has reached adulthood.
   The results seem to depend on the severity of the abnormality, reflected
   in the complication distribution rather than operative technique.}},

Abstract = {{This paper contends that firms can be classified according to the level
   of technology deployed in their products and processes into two main
   types: high and low technology firms. The paper further contends that
   the level of technology deployed will impact on the overall strategic
   planning process and its main drivers: leadership and organisational
   culture resulting in differing levels of corporate performance.
   Based on a nation-wide sample of 194 Managing Directors and Chief
   Executives of small and medium sized manufacturing firms, this study
   found that high technology firms tend to emphasise transformational and
   human resources leadership styles. Both of these leadership styles
   correlate positively with strategic planning and with the majority of
   performance indicators used. On the other hand, low technology firms
   emphasise transactional leadership, which correlates with internal
   strategy characteristics and short-term performance indicators. Similar
   results were obtained when culture styles were correlated with strategy
   and performance indicators in both types of firms. Finally, the overall
   performance of both types of firms indicates that high technology firms
   performed better than low technology firms.
   The findings suggest that low technology firms can achieve a similar
   confidence in facing the external environment as high technology firms
   by changing their strategic planning, leadership and organisational
   culture emphasis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Green lemons (Citrus limon (L.) Burm.) were imaged for chlorophyll
   fluorescence (CF) 30 minutes after immersion of the fruit into 55
   degrees C water for 5 minutes to determine if CF could be used to
   identify areas of hot water-induced rind injury before the appearance of
   visible symptoms. Fluorescence was variable in intensity over the
   surface of the rind with defined areas of enhanced fluorescence being
   present that corresponded in shape and location with visible injury that
   later developed during 24 hours of storage. Images showing minimum
   fluorescence (F-0) and maximal fluorescence (F-m) provided the best
   image contrast between injured and noninjured areas of the rind. Total
   F-0 present in the image was closely correlated (r(2) = 0.87) with the
   area of rind injury present following storage. Holding the fruit under
   conditions of low humidity for 24 h before hot water treatment prevented
   both the formation of areas of enhanced fluorescence and the

Abstract = {{The strategic localization of peptide transporter 2 (PEPT2), a
   proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter, to the apical membrane of
   epithelial cells in the kidney and choroid plexus suggests that it plays
   an important role in the disposition of peptides/mimetics in the body.
   Therefore, the in vivo significance of PEPT2 was investigated in
   wild-type and PEPT2 null mice following an i.v. bolus dose (0.05 mu
   mol/g body weight) of {[}C-14]glycylsarcosine (GlySar). In PEPT2 null
   mice, the clearance (total and renal) of GlySar was markedly increased
   (2-fold), resulting in concomitantly lower systemic concentrations. In
   addition, renal reabsorption was almost abolished, and GlySar was
   eliminated by glomerular filtration. Of the 46\% of GlySar reabsorbed in
   wild-type mice, PEPT2 accounted for 86\% and PEPT1 accounted for 14\% of
   reabsorbed substrate. Analysis of GlySar uptake in kidney sections
   revealed that PEPT2 was primarily localized in the outer medullary
   region. Wild-type mice also had greater choroid plexus concentrations of
   GlySar and a 5-fold greater choroid plexus/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   ratio as compared with null mice at 60 min. Null mice exhibited a
   greater CSF/blood ratio at 60 min (0.9 versus 0.2) and area under the
   curve (AUC)(CSF)/AUC(blood) ratio over 60 min (0.45 versus 0.12),
   indicating that PEPT2 significantly reduces the exposure of GlySar in
   CSF. Our in vivo results demonstrate that PEPT2 is the predominant
   peptide transporter in kidney and that it acts as an efflux transporter
   in choroid plexus. Thus, PEPT2 may have profound effects on the
   sensitivity and/or toxicity of peptides and peptide-like drugs.}},

Abstract = {{The virulence of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is due, in
   part, to its ability to cytoadhere in deep vascular beds. Our inability
   to quantify the load of sequestered parasites hampers our understanding
   of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in disease progression and
   complicates diagnosis. In this study we evaluate potential biochemical
   markers of sequestered load by comparing them with estimates of the
   sequestered load from a statistical model fitted to longitudinal
   patterns of peripheral parasite densities in a series of 22 patients
   with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The markers comprised the
   host factors: haematocrit, circulating host DNA, sTNF-R75 and parasite
   derived products HRP2, pLDH, pigments and circulating parasite DNA. We
   investigated the suitability, of these markers in determining
   sequestered loads in patients on quinine treatment. Observed peripheral
   parasitaemia, plasma levels of sTNF-R75 and circulating parasite DNA
   were most strongly correlated with estimates of sequestered loads on
   admission. However the dynamics of both sTNF-R75 and circulating
   parasite DNA during follow-up were very different from those of the
   estimated sequestered mass. These analyses suggest that none of the
   markers gave reliable estimates of the current sequestered load, though
   they may reflect the history of infection. Longitudinal analyses are
   needed that allow for the clearance rates of the marker molecules and
   for variations between hosts in the history of parasitaemia.}},

Title = {{Sediment trap results from the Japan trench in the Kuroshio domain:
   Seasonal variations in the planktic foraminiferal flux}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{315-326}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Time-series sediment traps were deployed at two depths at Station JT
   (Japan Trench) along the northern margin of the Kuroshio current system
   domain from March 1991 to May 1992. Total (> 125 mu m) foraminiferal
   fluxes were 334-1028 shells/m(2)/day in the shallow trap (1200 m) and
   657-2130 shells/m(2)/day in the deep trap (3700 m). A total of 35
   planktic foraminiferal species belonging to 13 genera were identified.
   The assemblage was dominated by Globigerina bulloides, Globigerinita
   glutinata, Globigerinoides ruber and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, whose
   fluxes varied seasonally. Globigerina bulloides and Globigerina
   quinqueloba occurred during the early spring phytoplankton bloom. These
   taxa were replaced by Globigerinoides ruber, Globigerinoides sacculifer,
   N. dutertrei and Pulleniatina obliquiloculata during the late spring to
   early autumn, with the development of a sharp thermocline and a deep
   chlorophyll a maximum Just below the thermocline. The maximum shell flux
   of Globigerinita glutinata, Globigerina falconensis, Globorotalia
   inflata and Globorotalia truncatulinoides occurred during the winter
   near the 18 degrees C isotherm in well-mixed surface water that resulted
   from the extensive vertical mixing induced by the winter monsoon.
   Temporal changes in the path of the Kuroshio current system caused by
   its meandering appeared to be the dominant flux control factor, based on
   the correlation between the meander types of the Kuroshio and the timing
   of large fluxes in the deep trap. During the trap experiments, major
   meanderings were observed from September to October 19,91 and from
   mid-April to May 1992. During these two periods, prominent flux peaks of
   Globigerina bulloides and Neogloboquadrina incompta were observed in
   both shallow and deep traps. The major meander of the Kuroshio current
   system was near Station JT during these periods, and the nearshore side
   of the Kuroshio Front, which is characterized by high productivity in
   the euphotic zone, was very close to Station JT. These results suggest
   that these two species were produced on the nearshore side of the
   Kuroshio Front and collected in the sediment trap. The temporal
   occurrences of N. incompta at Station JT associated with the meanders of
   the Kuroshio are consistent with the high abundance of N. incompta in
   the surface sediment record from beneath the modern cold water mass off
   Kishu and Enshu-nada, between the Japanese coast and the axis of the
   Kuroshio current system.}},

Abstract = {{The optical network is a promising approach for realizing a scalable
   backbone network. In backbone networks, survivability is very important
   because great volumes of traffic incur damage from faulty equipment. To
   address this issue, various recovery schemes have been proposed for
   optical backbone networks. Among those schemes, shared mesh restoration
   utilizes link bandwidth efficiently because the backup lightpaths share
   link bandwidth if they protect against different failures and are never
   utilized simultaneously. However, a route computation method for the
   backup lightpaths that promotes such bandwidth sharing is necessary to
   achieve efficient bandwidth utilization. This paper proposes a
   distributed route computation method for the backup lightpaths in shared
   mesh restoration. In this method, the link weight is estimated to be
   smaller if a backup lightpath newly established can share the link
   bandwidth with the backup lightpaths already accommodated in that link.
   The link weight can be calculated using the Markov Decision Theory. The
   bandwidth sharing between the backup lightpaths can be promoted by
   selecting the shortest route based on such modified link weights. The
   proposed method effectively realizes efficient utilization of the link
   bandwidth and achieves low loss rate of reliable lightpath establishment
   requests under the same traffic load. The proposed method restricts the
   amount of link state information advertised by the routing protocol and
   achieves a sufficiently small amount of route calculation.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) plays an important role in many
   biological events such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation,
   anti-fibrosis and antiapoptosis. It is well known that HGF promotes
   tumor progression and suppresses development of fibrosis after tissue
   injury. In contrast, its role in immune-mediated disorders has not been
   fully clarified. In the present study, we examined the role of HGF in
   Ag-specific immune response using in vitro studies and an experimental
   model of allergic airway inflammation. We first confirmed that dendritic
   cells (DCs) expressed the receptor for HGF, c-met, which was not
   expressed in T cells. Treatment with HGF both in vitro and in vivo
   potently suppressed DC functions such as Ag-presenting capacity, thus
   down-regulating Ag-induced Th1- and Th2-type immune responses. Exogenous
   administration of the HGF expression plasmid into Ag-primed mice
   markedly suppressed the development of airway eosinophilia and airway
   hyperresponsiveness, which was induced by Ag inhalation, with
   suppression of the Ag-presenting capacity of DCs in the lung. HGF
   exhibited these immunosuppressive effects without up-regulation of IL-10
   or TGF-beta. We also found that expression of endogenous HGF in the lung
   significantly increased following Ag sensitization and inhalation
   challenges. Finally, neutralization of endogenous HGF in vivo
   significantly increased airway eosinophilia and airway
   hyperresponsiveness with up-regulation of the Ag-presenting capacity of
   DCs in the lung. These results demonstrated a novel, significant, and
   possibly therapeutic role of HGF as a potent regulator in
   immune-mediated disorders such as asthma.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Activities of daily living (ADL) are a major domain in the
   clinical assessment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, ADL
   scales have not been sufficiently validated in Spain.
   Methods. Patients attending a neurology outpatient clinic were
   classified according to the global deterioration scale (GDS).
   Afterwards, an independent evaluator administeres two scales of
   instrumental activities of daily living (IADL): Lawton and Brody's scale
   of IADL (SIADL) and Pfeffer's functional activities questionnaire (FAQ).
   The SIADL was scored in the original way (dichotomic) (SIADLd) and in an
   alternative way (ordinal) (SIADLo). Internal consistency (Cronbach alpha
   coefficient), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation
   coefficient), diagnostic validity (sensitivity, specificity, number of
   patients correctly classified) and influence of different variables
   (regression analysis) were analyzed for the SIADLd, the SIADLo and the
   FAQ.
   Results. Ninety-eight patients were recruited. Internal consistency,
   reliability and diagnostic validity were good or excellent for the three
   scales. The SIADLo showed better diagnostic and scale features than the
   SIADLd, but the FAQ surpassed both in all the studied variables. No
   scale was able to make a proper distinction between patients with
   subjective complaints (GDS 2) and patients without complaints (GDS 1).
   Sex and age influenced the SIADL score, but not the FAQ score. The FAQ
   reached a sensitivity of 0.95 and a specificity of 0.88 in the screening
   of dementia.
   Conclusions. The SIADL and the FAQ are useful, valid and reliable tools
   for the clinical assessment of AD patients. Ordinal scoring is more
   advantageous than dichotomic scoring in the SIADL, but the FAQ is
   preferable.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Rapamycin-coated stents in coronary artery lesions have
   recently been shown to be effective in inhibiting neointimal formation.
   However, little is known about the effects of rapamycin on
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which is an important signal
   for neointimal formation. Therefore, we examined the effects of
   rapamycin on MAPK and transcriptional factors in cultured human coronary
   artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC) and in balloon-injured rat carotid
   arteries.
   Methods and Results: Activation of ERK, JNK, p38MAPK, AP-1, and NF-kB in
   coronary artery smooth muscle cells was increased by 2\% fetal bovine
   serum. Ten nmol/L of rapamycin prevented the activation of JNK, p38MAPK,
   AP-1, and NF-kB (65\%, 65\%, 67\%, and 26\% respectively, P < 0.01). In
   an in vivo study, remarkable neointimal formation was observed 14 days
   after injury. Coating Pluronic gel with 20 and 50 Rg rapamycin around
   the injured artery significantly decreased the intimal area/medial area
   ratio, compared with vehicle (0.75 vs. 1.2, P < 0.01). Rapamycin
   prevented the increase in activation of JNK, p38MAPK, AP-1, and NT-kB in
   injured artery (42\%, 70\%, 75\%, and 60\% respectively, P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Neointimal formation after balloon injury is inhibited by
   rapamycin, which is partially mediated by inhibition of JNK and p38MAPK,
   followed by AP-1 and NF-kB.}},

Abstract = {{We report on photoluminescence (PL) measurements of a symmetric
   GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum well (DQW) in high magnetic fields. For this
   study, a selectively contacted p-delta n-DQW-delta n-p structure was
   chosen, allowing an independent tuning of the electron density in the
   DQW and thus a creation of a two-dimensional electron gas. Our attention
   was focused on phenomena in in-plane magnetic fields, where the
   field-induced depopulation of the antibonding subband observable in the
   PL spectra as a so-called N-type kink was predicted by Huang and Lyo
   (HL) {[}Phys. Rev. B 59, 7600 (1999)]. Whereas the equivalent behavior
   has been observed several times in the electric transport measurements
   and a proper theoretical description has been found, to the best of our
   knowledge, no PL experiment in a direct comparison with the theoretical
   model developed by HL has ever been published. We carried out a
   self-consistent calculation based on their model and achieved a good
   agreement with our experimental results. Additionally, the influence of
   the excitonic interaction on the PL spectra, not taken into account by
   HL, is also discussed. This enables us to explain small deviations from
   the HL theory. The interpretation of the in-plane magnetic field
   measurements is supported by the experiment with the magnetic field in
   the perpendicular orientation that allows a sufficiently accurate
   estimation of the electron density in the DQW. Distinctive
   renormalization effects of DQW subbands at various electron densities
   are also observed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Since Rousseau the noble savage and the imagination of wildness have
   become ideals that serve as harmonic counterparts to the experience of
   alienation in modern life. In Robert Musil's great novel Der Mann ohne
   Eigenschaften (The man without qualities), which was written in view of
   the catastrophe of World War I with it's breakdown of all traditional
   values, the situation has changed radically. Wildness has lost its
   utopian qualities and is characterized now as an uncontrollable and
   irreducible force that appears in crime, madness, and (common) ecstasy.
   Since it is able to destroy the structures of personal identity just as
   those of social life when ignored and repressed, Musil also looks for
   possibilities to integrate it into life. The essay describes several
   aspects of wildness in Musil's novel while focussing on the psychotic
   murderer Christian Moosbrugger, who can be understood as a modern
   successor of the noble savage.}},

Abstract = {{The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs, Batten disease) are fatal
   inherited neurodegenerative diseases characterized by gross brain
   atrophy, blindness, and intracellular accumulation of lysosome-derived
   storage bodies. A CLN6 form in sheep is studied as a large animal model
   of the human diseases. This study describes neuropathological changes in
   brains from presymptomatic affected sheep. Activated astrocytes and
   focal clusters of activated microglia were present in outer layers of
   occipital and somatosensory cortical regions as early as 12 days of age,
   together with activated perivascular macrophages. Astrocytic activation
   and progressive transformation of microglia to brain macrophages
   preceded neurodegeneration and spread to different cortical areas, most
   prominently in regions associated with clinical symptoms. In contrast,
   storage body accumulation was much more evenly spread across regions.
   These data support suggestions that neurodegeneration and storage body
   accumulation may be independent manifestations of CLN6 mutation and
   indicate that glial cell activation may be an important mediator in
   pathogenesis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging infectious diseases may be contributing to the global decline
   of amphibian populations. In particular chytridiomycosis, a cutaneous
   fungal infection of amphibians caused by the chytrid Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis, gained attention in the 1990s as an apparently new
   pathogen. This fungus has been implicated as the causative agent of
   widespread mortalities among wild amphibians in geographically disparate
   parts of the world. To investigate the global distribution, historical
   occurrence, and infectiousness of this pathogen, we examined 33 71
   postmetamorpbic and adult amphibians collected between 1895 and 2001
   from 25 countries for the presence of chytrid fungi in the epidermis.
   Cutaneous chytrid infection was diagnosed in 383 of 2931 (13.1\%)
   specimens of 12 common amphibian species from five Canadian provinces
   and seven American states, including 30 of 69 locations examined in the
   St. Lawrence River Valley of Quebec Chytrids were observed in 7.0\%
   (461655) of the adults collected in the 1960s, the earliest cases being
   two green frogs (Rana clamitans) collected in 1961 from
   Saint-Pierre-de-Wakefield, Quebec. In recent studies, morbidity and
   mortality attributable to chytridiomycosis were not observed in infected
   amphibians from Quebec despite a 17.8\% (302/1698) prevalence of chytrid
   infection during the period 1990-2001. The prevalence of infection
   during this latter period was not statistically different when compared
   with the period 1960-1969. Epidermal chytrid infections were not
   observed in 440 amphibians examined from 23 other countries. In light of
   the fact that infection by B. dendrobatidis is widely distributed and
   apparently enzootic in seemingly healthy amphibians from eastern North
   America, lethal outbreaks of chytridiomycosis among amphibian
   populations appear to have complex causes and may be the result of
   underlying predisposing factors.}},

Abstract = {{Abnormal base compositional patterns of genomic DNA sequences are
   studied in the framework of a hierarchical structure (HS) model
   originally proposed for the study of fully developed turbulence {[}She
   and Leveque, Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 336 (1994)]. The HS similarity law is
   verified over scales between 10(3)bp and 10(5)bp, and the HS parameter
   beta is proposed to describe the degree of heterogeneity in the base
   composition patterns. More than one hundred bacteria, archaea, virus,
   yeast, and human genome sequences have been analyzed and the results
   show that the HS analysis efficiently captures abnormal base composition
   patterns, and the parameter beta is a characteristic measure of the
   genome. Detailed examination of the values of beta reveals an intriguing
   link to the evolutionary events of genetic material transfer. Finally, a
   sequence complexity (S) measure is proposed to characterize gradual
   increase of organizational complexity of the genome during the
   evolution. The present study raises several interesting issues in the

Abstract = {{We succeeded in observing bright electroluminescence (EL) from 1 wt
   \%-rubrene doped tetraphenylpyrene (TPPy) as an active layer in a

   light-emitting diode structure where the anode (source) and cathode
   (drain) electrodes are laterally arranged, providing us a chance to
   control the EL intensity by changing the gate bias. We demonstrated that
   TPPy provides compatible transistor and EL characteristics. Further, not
   only rubrene doping into the TPPy host but also adjusting the
   source-drain channel length significantly improved the EL
   characteristics. We observed a maximum EL quantum efficiency (eta(ext))
   of similar to 0.5\% with a Cr/Au source (S)-drain (D) electrode and a
   slightly higher eta(ext) of similar to 0.8\% with S-D electrodes of

Abstract = {{Complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray and two-dimensional (2-D) gel
   electrophoresis, combined with mass spectrometry, enable simultaneous
   analysis of expression patterns of thousands of genes, but their use in
   pulp biology has been limited. Here we compared gene and protein
   expression of pulp tissues from sound and carious human teeth using cDNA
   microarray and 2-D gel electrophoresis to evaluate their usefulness in
   pulp biology research and to identify the genes with changes in carious
   teeth. The cDNA microarray revealed several differentially expressed
   genes and genes with a high expression in both tissues. These genes have
   various functions, e.g. effects on vascular and nerve structures,
   inflammation, and cell differentiation. Variability between cDNA
   hybridizations indicates that the overall gene expression pattern may
   vary significantly between individual teeth. The 2-D gel electrophoresis
   revealed no change between healthy and diseased tissue. The
   identification of 96 proteins in the pulp tissue revealed none of the
   gene products with corresponding high/different mRNA expression in cDNA
   microarray. Interestingly, we detected also a hypothetical protein
   (putative nucleoside diphosphate kinase), and present therefore the
   first evidence for the existence of this protein. Even though the
   methods reveal potentially important gene expression, they may currently
   have only limited value in in vivo pulp biology research.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Among older people, distraction while walking may increase
   the risk of falls. Factors underlying individual differences in dual
   tasking are not fully understood. Our aim was to study the effect of a
   second task on maximal walking speed and to examine whether individual
   differences in walking speed measured with and without a second task are
   accounted for by genetic and environmental influences shared across
   tasks or specific to each task.
   Methods. The data were collected from the 101 monozygotic and 116
   dizygotic twin pairs aged 63-76 years recruited from the Finnish Twin
   Cohort. Maximal walking speed (MWS) over 10 m was measured on a
   laboratory corridor and timed with photocells. The test was repeated
   while subjects performed, first, a manual task (MWSmanual) and, second,
   a verbal task (MWSverbal).
   Results. Mean walking speed without a simultaneous task was 1.72 m/s
   (standard deviation {[}SD] 0.33), with a manual task it was 1.52 m/s (SD
   0.26), and with a verbal task it was 1.36 m/s (SD 0.27). Multivariate
   genetic analysis showed that an additive genetic factor in common
   accounted for 17\% of individual differences in MWS, 19\% in MWSmanual,
   and 12\% in MWSverbal. In addition, MWSverbal had a genetic factor
   specific to it accounting for 10\% of the variance. Shared environmental
   influences, common to all three traits, accounted for 39\%, 27\%, and
   21\% of the individual differences, respectively.
   Conclusion. Approximately half of the individual differences in walking
   with or without another task were accounted for by genetic and
   nongenetic familial effects in common, and the rest of the variation was
   accounted for by unique environmental factors in common and factors
   specific to walking tests.}},

   an epithelial tissue-specific manner. We studied by immunohistochemistry
   and confocal microscopy the distribution of cytokeratin subtypes in the
   biliary system of adult rat liver. A cytokeratin (CK) 19+/7-
   cholangiocyte population was observed in the smaller branches of the
   biliary tree including the canals of Hering. They proliferated after
   2-acetaminofluorene (AAF) administration, although later the typical
   oval cells expressed CK7. This observation suggests that cholangiocytes
   with this cytokeratin phenotype may harbor adult hepatic stem cells. The
   CK19+/7- cholangiocytes were not present in the rat liver at birth, but
   developed postnatally. Similar cell populations were not observed in
   human livers. In conclusion, we propose that the CK19+/7- phenotype may
   be characteristic for adult hepatic stem cells in rat liver and that
   these cells are generated de novo after birth.}},

Abstract = {{The successful integration of computers in educational environments
   depends, to a great extent, on students' attitudes towards them. Widely
   used computer attitude scales (CASs) focus on the beliefs of typical
   computer users and do not reveal the more refined attitudes of groups
   that use computers extensively and develop unique relations with them.
   This study presents the development and validation of a CAS especially
   designed for computer science freshmen (CASF). The scale consists of
   five factors, namely, self-confidence in previous knowledge, hardware
   usage anxiety, computer engagement, fears of long-lasting negative
   consequences of computer use and evaluation of positive consequences of
   computers in personal and social life. Using an analytic computer
   experience construct, the scale's components were related to multiple
   aspects of students' computer experience. CASF responses can inform a
   variety of instructional decisions and classroom management strategies
   for the first phase of the students' studies.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of linking physiology and observable behaviour is of
   great importance in gaining a better understanding of the dog's
   reactions to environmental changes and potential stressors. Many studies
   of human-dog interactions explored the issues concerning attachment of
   people to their pets, whereas only few studies investigated the nature
   of the dog-human relationship or the dog's level of attachment to its
   owner. The aim of this study was to investigate dog's reactions to
   different emotional situations integrating physiological (heart rate)
   and behavioural measures. Seventeen adult dogs were tested in a
   `strange' environment using a modified version of Ainsworth's Strange
   Situation Test. The procedure consisted of an introductory episode
   followed by eight consecutive experimental episodes in which the dogs
   were placed in an unfamiliar environment, introduced to an adult
   stranger and subjected to separations from the owner. During each
   observational session the behaviour of each dog was videorecorded and
   heart rate was measured in order to allow a comparison between heart
   rate and behaviour. The level of activity of each dog in each
   experimental episode was assessed recording 12 different behavioural
   categories. The heart rate values during the first experimental episode
   were analysed to obtain a baseline for each subject and the dogs' heart
   rate across episodes was assessed and compared to the baseline values.
   Furthermore, the effect of specific events (stranger's entrance and
   owner's return) on dogs' heart rate was evaluated.
   The results of the present pilot study show that socioemotional
   conditions induce changes in both behaviour and heart rate in adult dogs
   and that these changes, especially those at the behavioural level,
   indicate emotional stress. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To characterise all isolates with reduced susceptibility or
   resistance to ciprofloxacin received by the Scottish Neisseria
   gonorrhoeae Reference Laboratory (SNGRL) in 2002 using N gonorrhoeae
   multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST); to compare NG-MAST with
   conventional typing and to describe the epidemiology of ciprofloxacin
   resistant gonorrhoea in Scotland in 2002.
   Methods: Isolates were characterised on receipt by auxotyping and
   serotyping (A/S typing), and antibiotic susceptibility testing, and
   retrospectively by NG-MAST. Epidemiological data were requested for all
   isolates in the study.
   Results: The 106 isolates were separated into more sequence types (ST)
   than A/S classes ( 44 versus 17). All isolates within a sequence type
   had the same serotype, were homogeneous with respect to ciprofloxacin
   resistance category, but were sometimes heterogeneous with respect to
   auxotype or plasmid borne resistance to penicillin. Combined NG-MAST and
   epidemiological data revealed sustained transmission of several
   gonococcal strains predominantly within Greater Glasgow and Lothian.
   Clusters of isolates were associated with transmission within the United
   Kingdom, whereas isolates with unique STs were associated with foreign
   travel ( p< 0.0001).
   Conclusions: NG-MAST is more discriminatory than A/S typing.
   Ciprofloxacin resistant gonococcal isolates in Scotland are
   heterogeneous, with endemic spread of some strains occurring
   predominantly in Greater Glasgow and Lothian.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. Adjuncts to conventional surgical training are needed in order to
   address the reduction in working hours. This purpose of this study was
   to objectively assess the efficacy of workshop training on simulators.
   Methods. Fifteen consecutive participants of the European Vascular
   Workshop in 2003 and 2004 were recruited to this study. Participants
   performed a proximal anastomosis on a commercially available abdominal
   aortic aneurysm simulator, were then given intensive training on
   sophisticated models for 3 days and re-assessed. Pre- and post-course
   procedures were videotaped and independently reviewed by three assessors
   (tapes were blinded and in random order). The operative end product was
   similarly assessed. Four measures of technical skill were used: generic
   skill, procedural skill; a five point technical rating of the
   anastomosis (assessed using validated rating scales) and procedure time.
   Non-parametric tests were used in the statistical analysis.
   Results. The video assessment scores for aneurysm repair increased
   significantly following completion of the course (p= 0.006 and p = 0.004
   for generic and procedural skill, respectively). End product assessment
   scores increased significantly post-course (p = 0.001) and participants
   performed aneurysm repair faster following the course (p < 0.05).
   Inter-observer reliability ranged from alpha = 0.84-0.98 for the three
   rating scales pre- and post-course.
   Conclusion. Objective improvements in technical performance follow
   intensive workshop training. Participants' perform better,faster, and
   with an improved end product following the course. Such adjuncts to
   training play an important part in a focused integrated programme that
   addresses reduced work hours.}},

Abstract = {{BM88 is a neurone-specific protein implicated in cell cycle exit and
   differentiation of neuronal precursors. It is widely expressed in
   terminally differentiated neurones but also in neuronal progenitors,
   albeit in lower levels. Thus BM88 expression shows a tight correlation
   with the progression of progenitor cells towards neuronal
   differentiation. Here we report the genomic organization and proximal
   promoter characterization of the human and mouse BM88 genes. Both
   promoters lie in a CpG island, are TATA-less and have multiple
   transcription start sites. Deletion analysis performed on the human BM88
   gene revealed an 88 bp minimal promoter fragment that is preferentially
   active in neural cells. Importantly, this minimal promoter is sufficient
   to confer specific transcriptional activity in primary neurones, but not
   in glial cells. Within the promoter region there are four functional
   Sp1-binding sites. Simultaneous mutations to all four Sp1 sites results
   in complete loss of promoter activity. Transactivation experiments
   revealed that Sp1 directly activates the BM88 promoter while activation
   also occurs in the presence of neurogenin-1. Characterization of the
   promoter elements that control neurone-specific and developmental
   expression of BM88 should contribute to the elucidation of the
   transcriptional networks that regulate the transition from a
   proliferative neural progenitor to a post-mitotic neurone.}},

Abstract = {{Islet culture has emerged as a standard practice prior to clinical
   transplantation. However, culturing large numbers of islets requires low
   islet density (number of islets per unit surface area) and,
   consequently, 20 to 30 flasks per pancreas in order to avoid
   hypoxia-induced death (HID). There is a need for a simple, practical,
   small-footprint culture vessel that will accommodate aseptic maintenance
   of entire human islet isolations while avoiding HID. In this
   communication, we examine the hypothesis that by improving oxygen
   transfer through culture of islets on silicone rubber membranes (SRM),
   we may increase islet surface coverage and reduce the number of flasks
   required while avoiding HID. Our results demonstrate that islets
   cultured for up to 48 hours in vessels with SRM bottoms at 2000 to 4000
   islet equivalents (IE)/cm(2), a surface coverage 10- to 20-fold higher
   than the standard culture protocol, displayed no significant loss of
   viability. In contrast, islets cultured for 48 hours at 4000 IE/cm(2) in
   flasks with gas-impermeable bottoms suffered a 60\% to 70\% reduction in
   viability. The data suggest that it is possible to culture all islets
   isolated from a human pancreas on SRM in a single, standard-sized vessel
   while maintaining the same viability as with the current, standard
   culture protocols that require 20 to 30 flasks. This approach may lead
   to substantial improvements in islet culture for research and clinical
   transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Brasses are the most widely used copper-based alloys because of the good
   corrosion resistance, formability, high strength and excellent
   hot-working properties. However, dezincification occurs when one or more
   components of an alloy are more susceptible to corrosion than the rest
   and, as a result, are preferentially dissolved.
   In order to enhance the corrosion resistance, the brasses were exposed
   to pulsed DC oxygen plasma with various frequencies. The corrosion
   behavior of plasma oxidized brasses (POBs) with various pulse
   frequencies was investigated by electrochemical methods
   (potentiodynarmic polarization test, electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy) and surface analyses (X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscopy). Particular allention was paid to the effects of pulse
   frequency on the corrosion properties of POBs. From the results of
   electrochemical test, it was found that the oxidized brass under the
   condition of 1.5 Torr oxygen pressure and 20 kHz frequency was effective
   in improving corrosion resistance. This was attributed to the protective
   oxidized layer (ZnO). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Omeprazole (OMP) is a proton pump inhibitor used as an oral treatment
   for acid-related gastrointestinal disorders. In the liver, it is
   primarily metabolized by cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) isoenzymes such as
   CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. 5-Hyroxyomeprazole (5-OHOMP) and omeprazole sulfone
   (OMP-SFN) are the two major metabolites of OMP in human. Cimeticline
   (CMT) inhibits the breakdown of drugs metabolized by CYP450 and reduces
   the clearance of coadministered drug resulted from both the CMT binding
   to CYP450 and the decreased hepatic blood flow due to CMT Phenobarbital
   (PB) induces drug metabolism in laboratory animals and human. PB
   induction mainly involves mammalian CYP forms in gene families 2B and
   3A. PB has been widely used as a prototype inducer for biochemical
   investigations of drug metabolism and the enzymes catalyzing this
   metabolism, as well as for genetic, pharmacological, and toxicological
   investigations. In order to investigate the influence of CMT and PB on
   the metabolite kinetics of OMP, we intravenously administered OMP (30
   mg/kg) to rats intraperitoneally pretreated with normal saline (5
   mL/kg), CMT (100 mg/kg) or PB (75 mg/kg) once a day for four days, and
   compared the pharmacokinetic parameters of OMP. The systemic clearance
   (CLt) of OMP was significantly (p<0.05) decreased in CMT-pretreated rats
   and significantly (p<0.05) increased in PB-pretreated rats. These
   results indicate that CMT inhibits the OMP metabolism due to both
   decreased hepatic blood flow and inhibited enzyme activity of CYP2C19
   and 3A4 and that PB increases the OMP metabolism due to stimulation of
   the liver blood flow and/or bile flow, due not to induction of the
   enzyme activity of CYP3A4.}},

Abstract = {{The operation of a caesium fountain primary frequency standard is
   greatly influenced by the characteristics of two other important
   facilities. The first is a stable frequency reference and the second is
   the frequency-transfer system. A stable frequency reference such as a
   hydrogen maser is a virtual necessity since essentially no fountain dead
   time can be tolerated without it. The frequency stability of this
   reference has a significant impact on the procedures for evaluating
   certain systematic biases in the fountain. State-of-the-art frequency
   transfer technology is also necessary if the fountain is intended to
   contribute to TAI or to be compared with other remotely located
   frequency standards without excessive degradation of stated
   uncertainties. We discuss the facilities available at the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and how they impact the
   operation of NIST-F1, the primary frequency standard at NIST.}},

Abstract = {{Despite significant poverty reductions in nonmetropolitan America during
   the 1990s, Census 2000 reports that hundreds of counties still possess
   high poverty rates. They have not only populations that are
   disproportionately minority, lack education, and live in single-parent
   households, but also weak job growth and low levels of labor force
   participation. To assess the potential antipoverty benefits of economic
   development in high-poverty counties, the authors compare their
   poverty-generating process with that of remaining nonmetropolitan
   counties. A primary finding is employment growth reduces poverty more in
   high-poverty counties. Likewise, completion of high school and obtaining
   an associate degree reduce poverty more in these counties. These
   patterns also hold for counties with persistently high poverty across
   decades. Thus, the authors are guardedly optimistic that high-poverty
   counties, even those where poverty has been persistent, will experience
   reduced poverty if economic development policies successfully stimulate
   job growth and increase human capital.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, thermoelastic postbuckling behavior of cross-ply laminated
   composite conical shells under presumed uniform temperature distribution
   is studied. The finite deflection analysis is carried out to determine
   the relationship between the maximum deflection and the temperature
   rise, and to evaluate the minimum temperature parameter that causes the
   bifurcation of shell deformation from axisymmetric deformation mode to
   asymmetric one. The formulation is based on first-order shear
   deformation theory that accounts for the transverse shear. The governing
   equations, derived using minimum total potential energy principle, are
   solved using semi-analytical finite element approach. The critical
   temperature parameter values corresponding to the onset of bifurcation
   are compared with those evaluated from linear eigenvalue analysis. The
   detailed study is carried out to highlight the influences of
   length-to-radius and radius-to-thickness ratios, semi-cone angle, number
   of layers and the boundary conditions on the nonlinear
   prebuckling/postbuckling thermoelastic response of the laminated
   circular conical shells. The participation of axisymmetric and
   asymmetric modes in the total response of the shells is also
   highlighted. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe the changes in retinal thickness (RT) and visual
   acuity over time in patients with clinically significant diffuse
   diabetic macular edema (DIVE) after intravitreal injection of
   triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) and to compare patients with and without
   previous laser treatment.
   Methods: A total of 23 eyes with clinically significant DIVE received a
   4-mg IVTA injection. Twelve eyes were refractory to macular laser
   treatment (group 1), and 11 eyes received IVTA as primary therapy (group
   2). Visual acuity and changes in macular thickening shown by optical
   coherence tomography were evaluated 48 hours after injection, every 7
   days for 1 month, and at 3 months and 6 months of follow-up.
   Results: RT decreased in all eyes in both groups. The reduction of edema
   was maximal in the first 7 days after IVTA and tended to remain stable
   for 3 months. The decrease in RT over time was significant in both
   groups (P < 0.001). At 6 months, RT had increased in almost all eyes.
   Visual acuity improved quickly, to a maximum at 2 weeks in both groups,
   after which it remained stable for 3 months and then decreased.
   Improvement in visual acuity over time was significant in both groups (P
   < 0.001). The temporal characteristics of the changes in RT and visual
   acuity were similar in the two groups (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: IVTA was effective in reducing clinically significant DIVE
   and improving visual acuity in eyes with and without previous laser
   treatment. Its action was maximal in the first week and lasted
   approximate to 3 months in this study.}},

Volume = {{163}},

Abstract = {{We have extended the m(b)(Lg) method of Nuttli using root-mean-square
   (rms) amplitudes corrected for noise and a Delta(-1) dependence for
   geometrical spreading. Lg waves recorded on the German Regional Seismic
   Network (GRSN) for earthquakes in south-central Europe were used to
   develop an m(b)(Lg) formula requiring a new calibration constant C-rms
   to keep rms m(b)(Lg) on the same baseline as Nuttli's traditional
   formula based on 3rd-peak amplitudes. GRSN stations had to be calibrated
   for site terms and for Lg attenuation. Lateral variations in LgQ appear
   to be significant across the study area, and a regional Q model
   consisting of constant-Q partitions north, south and in the central Alps
   was developed using measurements based on interstation and two-event,
   single-station methods. When plotted against surface wave estimates of
   M-w, rms m(b)(Lg) measurements in central Europe are found to be
   consistent with M-w-m(b)(Lg) relationships for north America and
   southern Asia, thus supporting the transportability of our m(b)(Lg)
   formula. Frequency-wavenumber processing of Grafenberg Array data
   enabled us to extract Rayleigh waves for small events, and regional M-s
   were measured using the Marshall and Basham formula. Our M-s-m(b)(Lg)
   relationship extends to M-s 2.5 and agrees well with observations in
   other regions including the western United States. The discrimination
   potential of M-s-m(b)(Lg) observations was examined under realistic
   monitoring conditions, where path corrections were inferred from
   earthquake data and applied uniformly to natural sources and explosions.
   Under these conditions, m(b)(Pn, P) are greater than m(b)(Lg) for large
   NTS explosions; however, M-s-m(b) scaling slopes are steeper for P waves
   than they are for Lg, and M-s-m(b) observations for NTS explosions
   converge near m(b) 4. Thus, allowing for measurement errors and
   additional uncertainty in m(b)(Pn) due to regional bias, there is little
   difference in the discrimination potential for Pn and Lg waves at small
   magnitudes. As such, a regional M-s-m(b) discriminant based on Lg might
   be preferred owing to the better detectability of Lg waves for small
   earthquakes. These results need to be confirmed for explosions at other
   test sites. Compared to teleseismic experience, regional M-s-m(b)
   observations extend the discrimination capability to lower magnitudes by
   at least one M-s unit.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer metastasizes almost exclusively into the bone whereby it
   induces primarily an osteoblastic response. Non-calcemic vitamin D
   analogs have been shown to inhibit proliferation of prostate cancer
   cells in culture and inhibit their growth as subcutaneous xenografts in
   mice. However, their effect on prostate cancer cell growth in the bone
   has not been examined. In the present study, we inoculated the
   osteoblastic prostate cancer cell line MDA-PCa 2b into the bone of male
   SCID mice and examined the effect of the low-calcemic hybrid analog 1
   alpha-hydroxymethyl-16-ene-26,27-bishomo-25-hydroxy vitamin D-3
   (JK-1626-2) on their ability to induce bone lesions. We found that 7
   weeks after inoculation of MDA-PCa 2b cells, 90\% of the mice in the
   vehicle-treated group had significant bone lesions that were detectable
   by micro-computed tomography and characterized by thickening of the
   cortical bone and ossification of the epiphysis. Only 30\% of the mice
   in the analog-treated group (daily injections of 4 mu g/kg, 5 days/week
   for up to 7 weeks) had detectable bone lesions. Histological examination
   of the decalcified tumor-bearing bones has shown that tumor cells
   completely replaced the bone marrow in the diaphysis, and destroyed the
   trabecular bone in the metaphysis in 90\% of the vehicle-treated mice.
   In contrast, the metaphysis of 60\% of analog-treated mice appeared
   normal, although tumor cells were still found in the diaphysis of 70\%
   of the bones in the analog-treated group. There was no evidence of
   hypercalcemia in any of the analog-treated mice. In a co-culture,
   MDA-PCa 2b cells induced a profound mitogenic response in osteoblasts
   followed by enhanced differentiation. However, in the presence of the
   analog the mitogenic response of the osteoblasts to the malignant cells
   was significantly attenuated. These experiments led to the hypothesis
   that, in vivo, JK-1626-2 prevented the metastatic bone lesions by
   inhibiting the mitogenic response of osteoblasts to growth factors
   produced by MDA-PCa 2b cells. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Because the effects of treatment interruption on patients with >400
   CD4(+) cells/mu l and prolonged moderate HIV loads is unknown, their
   HIV1 RNA and DNA loads, plasma, and PBMC resistance mutations and CD4(+)
   kinetics were studied during 12 months of treatment interruption.
   Fifty-seven patients were included: 28 with undetectable (median 40
   months) and 29 with moderate (>1 year) HIV1 RNA levels (3.3 log(10)
   copies/ml) at the baseline MO. HIV1 RNA and CD4(+) counts were
   determined monthly. PBMC HIV1 DNA was quantified (real-time PCR) and its
   reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) genotypes analyzed (M0, M6,
   M12). Regardless of HIV1 RNA detectability at the baseline MO, all
   patients had comparable HIV1 RNA (median 4.6), DNA (median 2.9), CD4(+)
   (median 455) at month 12 (M12). The decisive moment was month 1 (M1),
   when the HIV1 RNA increase and CD4 decline stabilized, rendering MO
   differences non-significant and predicting outcome. The lower the CD4(+)
   nadir was before HAART, the steeper the CD4(+) decline at M1. HIV1 DNA
   shifted to wild-type genotype in 47\% (M6) and 79\% (M12) of RT, 64\% of
   PR major resistance mutations disappeared (M12). Treatment interruption
   is possible, regardless of the baseline MO HIV RNA status, but it must
   take into consideration the CD4(+) nadir, an outcome predictor, to
   initiate HAART before too severe depletion to preserve the possibility
   of treatment interruption. HIV1 DNA genotyping helps monitor patients
   with undetectable HIV RNA at M0.}},

Abstract = {{As a general pattern innervation of the cardiovascular system appears
   late during development in vertebrate embryos, and cardiovascular
   control may be achieved by hormonal activity in early stages. However,
   very little is known about the onset of NO-responsiveness during
   development, which in adult vertebrates is known to play a key function
   in many physiological processes such as control of vascular tone,
   neurotransmission, macrophage activity, and angiogenesis. Analysis of
   the effect of NO on the cardiovascular system in zebrafish (Danio rerio)
   embryos and larvae revealed almost no effect on cardiac activity during
   chronic exposure to NO-producing chemicals, whereas vascular reactivity
   was observed in veins and arteries of the zebrafish in early
   developmental stages (5-6 days post fertilization). Chronic exposure
   also modified the development of the vascular system. The presence of an
   NO donor (sodium nitroprusside) did not change the patterning of the
   vascular bed, but it induced an earlier appearance of some blood vessels
   in the trunk region of the zebrafish larvae. The data reveal that NO
   plays an important role in the development of the cardiovascular system
   and in the ontogeny of the cardiovascular control system in fish. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: The role of liver function tests (LFTs) in evaluating common
   bile duct (CBD) stones in patients with cholelithiasis has been studied
   widely. However, it is not clear whether these predictive models are
   useful in inflammatory gallstone disease.
   Methods: A review was undertaken of 385 consecutive patients admitted as
   an emergency for acute calculous gallbladder disease. The diagnosis of
   calculous cholecystitis was confirmed by ultrasonography or histological
   confirmation of acute or chronic inflammation of the gallbladder.
   Patients with obvious jaundice, defined as a bilirubin level above 80 mu
   mol/l, and gallstone pancreatitis were excluded.
   Results: Some 216 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 28 (13.0
   per cent) were found to have CBD stones. LFT results were not
   significantly different in patients with chronic, acute or complicated
   acute cholecystitis. Using several cut-off levels, gamma-glutamyl
   transpeptidase (GGT) had the highest specificity, positive predictive
   value and negative predictive value, comparable to a scoring system that
   combined all LFTs. Bilirubin was the least specific and predictive. A
   cut-off point for GGT at 90 units/l produced a sensitivity of 86 per
   cent (24 of 28), specificity of 74.5 per cent (140 of 188), and positive
   and negative predictive values of 33 per cent (24 of 72) and 97.2 per
   cent (140 of 144) respectively. This represented a one in three chance
   of CBD stones when the GGT level was above 90 units/l and a one in 30
   chance when the level was less than 90 units/l.
   Conclusion: Selection criteria based on GGT can be used in acute
   calculous cholecystitis to identify high-risk patients who would benefit
   most from further imaging to exclude choledocholithiasis.}},

Abstract = {{As routine bull breeding soundness evaluations are rarely carried out in
   the UK most practitioners may be unfamiliar with the procedure of
   collecting and evaluating semen from bulls. This paper briefly reviews
   the techniques available for collecting semen from bulls in the field
   namely, artificial vagina, electroejaculation, collection from mated
   female/internal artificial vagina and massage of ampullae. After
   collection of a semen sample it is critical that the examination is
   carried out to a high standard to avoid erroneous conclusions being
   drawn. Examination of the semen sample for sperm motility and morphology
   is described in detail as these parameters have been shown to be
   correlated with fertility.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Haemophilia B, a deficiency in clotting factor IX (FIX), occurs in about
   I in 25.000 males. Of these patients, approximately 40\% are
   characterized as having `severe' haemophilia (FIX below 1\% of normal).
   Although the use of plasma-derived or rFIX has extended the lifespan of
   these patients, they remain afflicted by a variety of sequelae of the
   disease. Interestingly, a relatively small increase in the levels of FIX
   results in a dramatic increase in the quality of life, requiring rFIX
   substitution only prior to dental and surgical procedures. This latter
   trait of the disease suggests that gene therapy only needs to achieve
   modest expression and makes this disease a prime candidate for
   proof-of-concept of gene therapy. Current protocols for gene therapy
   entail the risk of malignant transformation. In addition the viral
   vectors may cause substantial pathology. Hence, the field requires the
   development of inherently safe gene therapy. Recently, developed
   protocols have been developed to transduce peripheral blood cells with
   high efficiency using RNA as a vector. These protocols in which the
   inherently safe RNA-based gene therapy approach will be validated and
   implemented for haemophilia B will provide in turn providing important
   proof-of concept for this type of therapy for more prevalent diseases
   but requires optimization of this strategy, probably by enhancing RNA
   stability using artificial nucleotides and modified UTRs, enhanced
   production of protein by codon usage optimization and the use of
   multi-cistronic constructs, and enhanced secretion of the protein
   employing target cell-tailored secretion signals.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of the cationic dyes acridine, 9-aminoacridine (9AA),
   and proflavine, with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was studied by
   electronic absorption, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence
   spectroscopies. The dyes interact with SDS in the pre-micellar region
   leading in two cases to dimerization in dye-surfactant aggregates, but
   with distinct molecular arrangements. For proflavine, the observed red
   shift of the electronic absorption band indicates the presence of
   J-aggregate, which are nonfluorescent. In the case of 9AA, the
   aggregates were characterized as nonspecific (neither J- nor H-type is
   spectroscopically observed). The time-resolved emission spectra gives
   evidences of the presence of weakly bound dimers by the recovery of
   three defined decay times by global analysis: dye monomer (tau(1) = 16.4
   ns), dimer (tau(2) = 7.1 ns), and a faster component (tau(3) = 2.1 ns)
   ascribed to intracluster energy migration between monomer and dimer.
   Acridine has a weak interaction with SIDS forming only an ion pair

Abstract = {{Background and aim: The majority of patients with chronic pancreatitis
   are alcoholics. Our goal was to develop a mouse model of alcohol
   dependent chronic pancreatitis.
   Methods: Mice were fed either the non-alcohol containing Lieber-DeCarli
   diet or the Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 24\% of calories as ethanol.
   After eight weeks and while on their respective diets, mice were
   subjected to repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis elicited by
   administration of caerulein. They were sacrificed 1, 3, and 5 weeks
   after the last dose of caerulein. Pancreatic morphology and collagen
   deposition were evaluated in samples stained with haematoxylin-eosin and
   Sirius red. Collagen content was quantitated by measuring OH-proline.
   Gene expression was determined by quantitative polymerase chain
   reaction.
   Results: Both groups of mice gained weight at the same rate. Those
   receiving the alcohol containing diet had serum alcohol levels of
   approximately 100 mM. No histological or gene expression differences
   were found in mice that were not subjected to acute pancreatitis,
   regardless of their diet. Necrosis, Sirius red staining, OH-proline
   content, and expression of alpha-1 collagen I, alpha-smooth muscle
   actin, transforming growth factor beta 1, and tissue inhibitor of
   metalloproteinase 1 were all increased in mice fed the alcohol
   containing diet and given caerulein compared with those fed the control
   diet and given caerulein. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression was
   transiently decreased in mice fed ethanol and given caerulein compared
   with the group given caerulein but not fed ethanol.
   Conclusion: We have developed a mouse model of alcohol dependent chronic
   pancreatic fibrosis. This mouse model may be useful in studies examining
   the effects of genetic manipulation on chronic pancreatitis.}},

Abstract = {{Smokers often experience the acute effects of cigarette smoking while
   they are engaged in the light physical activity of routine tasks.
   However, virtually all laboratory-based research on these effects is
   conducted under conditions of quiet rest and, thus, may not generalize
   to effects in the natural environment. We examined changes in the
   discriminative stimulus, subjective, cardiovascular, and reinforcing
   effects of nicotine in humans as a function of the level of concurrent
   physical activity. Men and women smokers (N = 17) were initially trained
   to discriminate 20 mu g/kg nicotine by nasal spray from placebo (0 mu
   g/kg) at rest. Three sessions then followed, in which the generalization
   of discrimination was tested across a range of doses (0-20 mu g/kg)
   while at rest or engaged in very light or light physical activity (15\%
   and 30\% of heart rate reserve, respectively) via bicycle ergometer.
   Generalization testing involved both two- and three-choice
   ({''}novel{''} option) quantitative procedures. Self-reported mood via
   the Profile of Mood States and visual analog scales, and cardiovascular
   measures of heart rate and blood pressure were obtained concurrent with
   discrimination responding. Nicotine reinforcement was assessed after the
   end of generalization testing using a choice procedure under the same
   rest or activity conditions. Results showed that physical activity did
   not significantly alter nicotine discrimination or reinforcement, as no
   interactions between activity and nicotine were observed. When activity
   and nicotine influenced the same subjective and cardiovascular
   responses, they acted in a generally additive fashion. These findings
   suggest that research on the acute effects of nicotine conducted under
   typical resting laboratory conditions generally are not altered by light
   physical activity and so may generalize to the effects of nicotine under
   conditions common in the natural environment.}},

Title = {{Beyond size: Matrix projection models for populations where size is an

Abstract = {{Size-based matrix models have been an important analytical tool in the
   study of populations. Although size can be an important variable in
   determining demographic parameters such as survivorship, growth, and
   reproduction, other factors such as genetic variation and access to
   resources can play key roles. We determined that size was not the only
   state variable that explained the survivorship, reproduction and future
   growth of the annual kelp, Alaria nana. A. nana shows persistent
   differences among individuals in growth (growth autocorrelation) that
   could be characterized with a negative residual (relatively poor growth)
   or positive residual (relatively good growth) from the relationship
   between size and growth. In two separate years of demographic study, we
   show that, during good growth conditions, growth autocorrelation is
   relatively strong, while poorer growth conditions associated with the
   1997 El Niho event resulted in less consistency among individuals in
   growth state. To quantitatively describe this population, we used a size
   based matrix model with an added state to reflect previous growth
   status. We show that a matrix projection model with growth state better
   captures the size structure of a natural population of A. nana and the
   fate of individuals than one that uses only size. Without growth state,
   a size-based model underestimates the number of individuals that get
   large and thus the potential grmkth rate of the population. When we used
   our model to approximate among generations pattern, and included a loop
   analysis algorithm, we found that fast growth to the largest size class
   contributed greatly to population growth in the relatively good year but
   that there were not such obvious benefits to getting large in the EI
   Niho year. The sizebased model with growth state that we present here is
   general and applicable to any species where persistent individual
   differences in performance violate the first-order Markov assumption of
   stage- or size-based matrix models.}},

Abstract = {{FTR spectroscopie was employed to describe the functional groups
   responsible for binding with cotton cellulose. In addition to finding
   direct dye-cellulose interactions involving hydroxyl groups in the host
   fiber, it is postulated that intermolecular interactions exist between
   dye molecules and glycosidic groups. At present, an analytical chemist
   who wants to make an exhaustive description of compounds, mixtures,
   polymers or biological samples under examination needs high-tech
   instrumentation and the latest methods of data processing and
   visualization. One of the most dynamically developing methods of data
   interpretation is 2D spectroscopy. This method is used for analyzing IR,
   NIR, Raman, UV-Vis and fluorescent spectra, as well as in X-ray
   scattering and mass spectroscopy techniques. This paper attempts to
   provide a general answer to the question of how model direct dyes
   interact with cellulose structure. For assessing the interactions
   between model direct dyes and cotton cellulose, the 1D FTR and 2D FTR
   were chosen. To this end, synchronic and asynchronic 2D maps for FTR
   spectra were constructed. In a synchronic map, bands with 1100 cm(-1)
   and 1125 cm(-1) wavenumbers are responsible for the interaction of model
   dyes with COC groups or CC rings (at 1125 cm(-1)) in cotton. Information
   obtained through analyzing synchronic maps is confirmed by the analysis
   of bands generated in asynchronic maps.}},

Abstract = {{Fifty-nine children with well-controlled, mild to moderate persistent

   in nasal fluid. Rates of TTV positivity and mean nasal TTV loads were
   not dissimilar to those observed in the general population and in a
   group of 30 age- and residence-matched healthy control children without
   a history of asthmatic disease. However, in the children with asthma, 3
   important indices of lung function - forced expiratory flow (FEF) in
   which 25\% and 75\% of forced vital capacity (FVC) is expired (FEF25\% -
   75\%), forced expiratory volume in 1 s/FVC, and FEF25\% - 75\%/FVC -
   showed an inverse correlation with nasal TTV load. Furthermore, signs of
   reduced airflow were more frequent in the children with asthma who had
   high nasal TTV loads (>= 6 log(10) DNA copies/mL of nasal fluid) than
   they were in those who had low nasal TTV loads (< 6 log(10) DNA
   copies/mL of nasal fluid), despite similar therapy regimens. In
   contrast, the control children showed no associations between nasal TTV
   load and the spirometric indices. Levels of eosinophil cationic protein
   in sputum were also greater in the children with asthma who had higher
   nasal viral burdens than they were in those who had lower nasal viral
   burdens. These findings are the first report of TTV infection status in
   children with asthma and suggest that TTV might be a contributing factor
   in the lung impairment caused by this condition.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Core biopsy (CB) has now largely replaced fine needle
   aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the pre-operative assessment of breast
   cancer. We studied the contribution of FNAC, when done as an adjunct to
   CB, in cancer patients presenting symptomatically.
   Patients: 112 patients had both CB and FNAC pre-operatively and
   subsequently had surgery (wide local excision or mastectomy). CB Et FNAC
   were done clinically in half the patients and under ultrasound guidance
   in the majority of others.
   Results: The complete sensitivity of FNAC was 90\% and that of CB was
   99\%. Absolute sensitivity was 67\% and 94\%, respectively. CB was not
   suspicious of malignancy (131) only in 1 patient in whom FNAC was
   suspicious (0). In this patient there was a high degree of suspicion of
   breast cancer clinically Et radiologically so a negative CB would not
   have been accepted even in the absence of FNAC.
   Conclusions: FNAC, when performed in addition to CB, does not provide
   useful additional information in symptomatic breast cancer patients. (c)

Abstract = {{Background: Azithromycin is related to erythromycin but is more active
   against gram-negative bacteria and less active against streptococci and
   staphylococci compared with erythromycin. For these reasons, and because
   of convenience of dosing (QD for 3 days), azithromycin is widely used in
   Mexico. Although several generic formulations of azithromycin are
   available in Mexico, information concerning the bioavallability of each
   formulation in the Mexican population is not available.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the bioavailability and
   tolerability of 2 oral formulations of azithromycin 500 mg used in
   Mexico: Macrozit (R) (trademark of Laboratorios Liomont, S.A. de C.V.,
   Mexico City, Mexico; test formulation) and Azitrocin (R) (trademark of
   Pfizer, S.A. de C.V., Mexico City, Mexico; reference formulation).
   Methods: This 2 X 2, crossover, randomized, open-label study was
   conducted at the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Universidad
   Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico. Eligible subjects were
   healthy volunteers of either sex and with the following characteristics:
   age 2,49 to 25 years, weight 54 to 77 kg, and height 159 to 177 cm.
   Subjects were randomly assigned to receive Macrozit followed by
   Azitrocin, or vice versa, with a 3-week washout period between doses.
   After a 12-hour (overnight) fast, subjects received a single, 500-mg
   dose of each formulation. For analysis of pharmacokinetic properties,
   including C-max, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity), blood samples were drawn
   at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours after
   dosing. The formulations were considered bioequivalent If the logarithm
   (In)-transformed ratios of C-max and AUC were within the predetermined
   equivalence range of 80\% to 125\% and if P <= 0.05 for the 90\% CIs.
   Tolerability was assessed by monitoring and subject interview regarding
   the potential presence of adverse events (AEs).
   Results: Twenty-eight subjects were enrolled in the study; 27 completed
   it (14 men, 13 women; mean age, 21.7 years). Fourteen subjects received
   the test formulation first. No period or sequence effect was observed.
   The 90\% CIs for the corresponding ratios of C-max, AUC(0-t), and
   AUC(0-infinity). were 80.67 to 107.21, 91.39 to 107.59, and 90.61 to
   106.19 (all, P < 0.05). Similar results were found for data without a
   logarithmic transformation. No AEs were found throughout the study.
   Conclusions: In this small study in healthy Mexican volunteers, a
   single, 500-mg dose of Macrozit was found to be bioequivalent to that of
   Azitrocin based on the rate and extent of absorption. Both formulations
   were well tolerated.}},

Title = {{Color Doppler ultrasonography is reliable in assessing the risk of
   esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of the study was to examine the role of Doppler
   ultrasonography of the portal vein in predicting esophageal variceal
   bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension by
   comparing the ultrasound data to the endoscopic findings.
   Patients and methods: 99 patients with liver cirrhosis and esophageal
   varices underwent color Doppler ultrasonography and
   esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The following portal hemodynamic parameters
   were analyzed: diameter and cross-sectional area, mean blood flow
   velocity, blood flow volume, perfusion pressure gradient, congestion
   index, and platelet count/spleen diameter ratio. Variceal
   characteristics, the size and the presence of red signs, were determined
   by endoscopic examination.
   Results: Patients with variceal red signs had significantly higher
   values of portal diameter (1.538 +/- 0.246 vs. 1.243 +/- 0.167),
   cross-sectional area (1.286 +/- 0.448 vs. 0.945 +/- 0.256), blood flow
   volume (965.520 +/- 432.728 vs. 625.117 +/- 320.999) and congestion
   index (0.165 +/- 0.068 vs. 0.126 +/- 0.051) than patients without red
   signs, while the perfusion pressure gradient (0.260 +/- 0.087 vs. 0.447
   +/- 0.271) and the platelet/spleen ratio (522.424 +/- 222.823 vs.
   708.921 +/- 230.769) were lower. The same pattern of differences between
   the ultrasound parameters was found in patients with large varices
   comparing ones with red signs to the ones without them (diameter 1.567
   +/- 0.234 vs. 1.258 +/- 0.175; cross-section 1.313 +/- 0.455 vs. 1.061
   +/- 0,264; flow volume 988.195 +/- 443.353 vs. 739.423 +/- 414.281;
   congestion index 0.171 +/- 0.067 vs. 0.130 +/- 0.058; perfusion pressure
   gradient 0.247 +/- 0.078 vs. 0.501 +/- 0.379 and platelet/spleen ratio
   479.930 +/- 184.302 vs. 699.094 +/- 316.171). Differences in values of
   ultrasonographic parameters were less obvious among groups of patients
   with different variceal sizes: only the diameter, cross-sectional area
   and blood flow volume were significantly different. The mean blood flow
   velocity did not depend on the variceal size, or on the presence of red
   signs. The sensitivities and specificities of the analyzed parameters
   were 60-80\% and 48.6-78.4\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that color Doppler ultrasonography is a
   useful non-invasive method for evaluating the risk of esophageal
   variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis.}},

Abstract = {{Study design: Open comparative study.
   Objective: To compare the impact of volume-dependent intermittent
   catheterization (VDIC) and time-dependent intermittent catheterization
   (TDIC) on financial burden and clinical outcomes in patients with spinal
   cord lesions (SCL).
   Setting: Department of Spinal Rehabilitation, Loewenstein Rehabilitation
   Hospital, Israel.
   Method: Economic and clinical outcomes were examined in 13 SCL patients
   treated with VDIC following bladder volume measurement by a portable
   ultrasound device ( the study group), and in 11 patients treated with
   TDIC ( the control group). Patients were followed for 12 - 30 days.
   Costs were calculated according to December 2003 prices at Loewenstein
   Hospital. The t-test and the Fisher's Exact Test were employed for
   comparisons between the groups.
   Results: The number of catheterizations per patient per day, the time
   required to perform volume measurements and catheterizations, and their
   total cost, were approximately 44, 49, and 46\% lower in the study group
   than in the control group. SCIMU ( representing bladder management
   functioning) increased during the study in both groups, and the increase
   was 31\% higher in the study group than in the control group. Urinary
   infection was found in three patients in the control group and in none
   in the study group.
   Conclusion: VDIC has economic and probably also clinical advantages over
   TDIC.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of alcohol consumption on HIV pathogenesis is not well
   understood. In this study we used the simian immunodeficiency virus
   (SIV)/macaque model of HIV infection to study the influence of chronic
   binge alcohol consumption on SIV infection. Rhesus macaques were fed
   alcohol or isocaloric amounts of sucrose via indwelling intragastric
   catheters and then inoculated with SIVmac251 by the rectal route.
   Real-time RT-PCR for SIV gag mRNA showed significantly higher plasma
   viral copies in alcohol-consuming macaques at 4 and 6 weeks pi, compared
   with sucrose controls. The viral copies were 1 to 2 logs higher in these
   animals. The percentage of CD8(+) lymphocytes in the duodenum of
   alcohol-consuming macaques was significantly lower than in
   sucrose-consuming macaques both before infection as well as at different
   time points postinfection. Also, the percentage of CD4(+) CD3(+)
   lymphocytes in the intestines was significantly higher in
   alcohol-consuming macaques before infection. These findings suggest that
   a higher percentage of SIV target cells (CD4) in the gut coupled with
   lower percentages of CD8 cells, which could be important in controlling
   virus replication, may be responsible for the higher SIV loads observed
   in alcohol-consuming macaques.}},

Abstract = {{The South American pepper frog, Leptodactylus labyrinthicus, is a large
   species that lays eggs in foam nests in holes dug out of the banks of
   different bodies of water. Recently, it was reported that only 6-10\% of
   eggs are fertilized in foam nests of L. labyrinthicus and the remaining
   unfertilized eggs are consumed by the tadpoles inside the nest. Here we
   tested experimentally the influence of the ingestion of trophic eggs on
   the survivorship and growth of L. labyrinthicus tadpoles. Tadpoles fed
   on trophic eggs and subsequently fed on dry fish food grew larger than
   those fed only on dry fish food, and this suggests that the ingestion of
   trophic eggs is an adaptation to improve tadpole growth. The ingestion
   of trophic eggs also seems to be important for the maintenance of
   tadpoles in environments with unpredictable rainfall, as they were able
   to survive for about 70 days feeding only on these trophic eggs and one
   tadpole managed to complete metamorphosis feeding on trophic eggs only.
   Details of the spawning behaviour observed in the field, occurrence of
   multiple mating, and predation on eggs by terrestrial invertebrates and
   vertebrates are also reported.}},

Abstract = {{Confinement in the reversed field pinch (RFP) has been shown to increase
   strongly with current profile control. The MST RFP can operate in two
   regimes: the standard regime with a naturally occurring current density
   profile, robust reconnection and dynamo activity; and the improved
   confinement regime with strong reduction in reconnection, dynamo and
   transport. New results in standard plasmas include the observation of a
   strong two-fluid Hall effect in reconnection and dynamo, the
   determination that the m = 0 edge resonant mode is nonlinearly driven,
   and the determination that tearing modes can lock to the wall via eddy
   currents in the shell. New results in improved confinement plasmas
   include observations that such plasmas are essentially dynamo-free,
   contain several isolated magnetic islands (as opposed to a stochastic
   field) and contain reduced high frequency turbulence. Auxiliary current
   drive and heating is now critical to RFP research. In MST, a programme
   to apply auxiliary systems to the RFP is underway and progress has
   accrued in several techniques, including lower hybrid and electron
   Bernstein wave injection, ac helicity injection current drive, pellet
   injection and neutral beam injection.}},

Abstract = {{Rice is the staple food of many countries and its sensory quality is of
   great concern to the consumers. Its preservation through thermal
   processing in retort pouches,for ready-to-eat purposes was carried out
   by different time-temperature schedules with and without oil to achieve
   a minimum F-o of 3 min. The sensory analysis of the cooked rice carried
   out using quantitative descriptive analysis showed that a process
   schedule of 118C, 8 min was optimum to have the optimal sensory
   characteristics. The same rice samples were subjected to instrumental
   texture measurements by texture analyzer using a cross-head speed of 0.5
   mm/s with 90\% compression for hardness and stickiness parameters. The
   instrumental hardness showed high correlation with sensory hardness,
   chewiness and overall quality (r = 0.72; r = 0.73; r = 0.79) and a
   negative correlation with sensory stickiness (r = -0.75). Applying
   principal component analysis, thermally processed rice samples were
   further classified based on the sensory and instrumental texture
   attributes.}},

Abstract = {{Certain nonlinear diffusion equations of degenerate parabolic type
   display a finite speed of propagation of disturbances. This mathematical
   behavior can be used to describe a wide range of nonlinear phenomena
   such as the penetration distance of a thermal layer, the boundary of a
   reaction zone, or a wetting front in unsaturated soil moisture flow.
   However, there are two main difficulties in obtaining solutions to
   problems of this class. One is that the location of the interface is not
   known a priori and must be discovered during the analysis. The other is
   the fact that the differential equation is singular in the neighborhood
   of the interface. The solution technique developed and presented in this
   work overcomes these difficulties by extracting a local solution of the
   differential equation in the neighborhood of the diffusing front. One
   profound result is the discovery that the velocity of the front is
   entirely controlled by the first term of the spectral series expansion.
   Also, by capturing the critical behavior of the solution in the region
   of the singularity and incorporating the behavior as a dominant factor,
   the series expansion is provided a means for very rapid convergence. The
   versatility of the solution technique is demonstrated by solving various
   boundary value problems covering a broad range of interest and the
   solutions are tested against previously published results. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop 2D H-1-MRS measurement sequences for the evaluation

   healthy and diseased bone marrow.
   Materials and Methods: Single-voxel localized variants of COSY and
   DQF-COSY 2D H-1-MRS sequences were developed for use at 1.5 T to
   investigate the biochemical composition of human bone marrow in vivo.
   The performance of each sequence was initially tested in vitro using
   lipid phantoms. An unsaturated lipid proton index was developed to
   interrogate the degree of unsaturation within the triacylglyceride (TAG)
   acyl chains. Localized 2D H-1-MRS data were obtained from the bone
   marrow of healthy controls (N = 6), patients presenting with acute
   leukemia (N = 6) and patients with acute leukemia in remission (N = 4).
   Results: The COSY and DQF-COSY data recorded from all subject cohorts
   were similar, and the unsaturated lipid proton index did not reveal
   significant differences between patient groups. Variations in water
   content and measured relaxation times showed minor differences between
   the measurement groups.
   Conclusions: No significant differences were observed in the spectra
   obtained from bone marrow using the 2D H-1-MRS sequences. A novel

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and precision of tractionless
   retinal tissue dissection by the advanced version of the pulsed electron
   avalanche knife for fine cutting (PEAK-fc; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena,
   Germany).
   Methods: Porcine retina (in vivo) and human retina (in vitro) were
   incised with the PEAK-fc using various pulse parameters. The globes were
   then processed for light microscopy. Evaluation of all specimens focused
   on depth of the retinal cuts and on the degree of collateral damage.
   Results: Retinal cuts performed both in vivo on porcine eyes and on
   human donor eyes showed very sharp edges with only little collateral
   damage. With probes of 600 pm in length, the optimal pulse parameters
   for precise and reproducible cutting of the retina were an amplitude of
   350 to 380 V, a repetition rate of 300 Hz, and 30 ``minipulses{''} per
   pulse of 100-microsecond duration. With increasing voltage, cuts also
   affected the retinal pigment epithelium and the choroid, followed by
   intravitreal bleeding during in vivo application.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated that PEAK-fc is capable of precisely cutting
   retinal tissue in vivo and in vitro using optimal pulse parameters.
   Further in vivo studies will be necessary to determine the efficacy of
   this new tractionless cutting device in vitreoretinal surgery.}},

Abstract = {{That the Nazis never succeeded in extirpating the Socialist traditions
   of the German working class is attested to by the universality and
   vigour of the anti-fascist movement that sprang to life during the final
   days of the Second World War and during the first days and weeks of
   allied occupation. In almost every part of Germany, in every city or
   major town, and in thousands of the smaller towns and villages, there
   emerged ad-hoc `antifascist committees' of Socialists, Communists and
   other antifascists who, with great energy and enthusiasm, set about
   restoring some degree of order out of the chaos into which Germany had
   been plunged by the collapse of the Nazi regime.
   For the most part these `antifas' or `action committees' focused their
   energies on the practical tasks of clearing rubble from the streets:
   taking control of remaining supplies of food: preventing looting:
   re-establishing supplies of gas, electricity and water; restoring
   telephone communications: and providing emergency health care to the
   desperate population. When time and resources allowed, they also engaged
   in political activities such as distributing antifascist literature,
   staging public meetings, and, above all, removing prominent Nazis from
   their posts in industry, local government and public services.
   Particularly in traditional strongholds of the Labour movement, the
   antifas played an important role during the transitional phase between
   the collapse of Nazi rule and the establishment of effective military
   government.(1)
   Though many of these committees were tiny, containing only a handful of
   individuals, some grew to a considerable size. At the end of April 1945,
   according to one account, the antifascist committee in Leipzig consisted
   of no fewer than thirty-eight local committees with 4500 members and
   150,000 supporters, go per cent of whom were working class.' Just two
   weeks after its foundation, the antifain Bremen allegedly comprised
   fourteen local groups with 4625 members, with another fourteen groups
   and 2230 members in the surrounding countryside.(3)
   However, Germany's new masters, for reasons that are still debated, did
   not look kindly on these manifestations of the grass-roots, spontaneous
   political activism of the antifascist Left. The American, British and
   French occupiers either suppressed them immediately, or allowed them a
   few weeks of curtailed activity before shutting them down.(4) The
   Soviets might have been expected to be more tolerant of the antifas,
   partly because they were led in many cases by members of the Communist
   Party (KPD),(5) and partly because, during the war, the Soviets and
   exiled KPD leadership had frequently in their propaganda called upon the
   German people to form `People's Committees' (Volksausschusse) to
   undertake precisely the same sort of tasks as the antifascist
   committees.(6) in the event, the Russians proved almost as unsympathetic
   to the antifas as their western counterparts, and, throughout the Soviet
   zone, the committees were closed down within the first days or weeks of
   occupation.(7).}},

   PbI2. Using spectroscopic mapping we find a statistical correlation
   between the radial breathing mode (RBM) and D band intensity. All the
   investigated samples show the same correlation using the 514 nm laser
   excitation. We derive the phonon deformation potential for the D band
   and extend the dispersion of the D band to the UV. We find that the
   intensity of the D band decreases with increasing pressure and vanishes
   at a pressure comparable to what has been observed earlier for the RBM
   and D-{*} band.}},

Abstract = {{Three bacterial strains isolated from oysters recovered at the Spanish
   Mediterranean coast have been phenotypically and genetically
   characterized. The results of the phylogenetic analysis based on almost
   complete 16S rDNA sequences clustered all three strains together with
   99.9\% average sequence similarity and situated them in the
   neighbourhood of the genera Stappia, Roseibium and Pannonibacter,
   Stappia aggregata being their closest neighbour with sequence
   similarities between 98.8\% and 98.9\%. DNA-DNA hybridization
   experiments using DNA of strains 50M6(T) and S. aggregata CECT 4269(T)
   as reference DNAs confirmed the independent status at species level of
   the oyster isolates. Phenotypically, they can be distinguished from the
   closest relatives by the ionic requirements, growth temperatures and use
   of carbon compounds. We propose these oyster strains constitute a new
   species of Stappia, for which the name Stappia alba sp. nov. has been
   chosen, and strain 50M6(T) (=CECT 5095(T) = CIP 108402(T)) as its type

Abstract = {{Reconstruction of the vagina has always been a formidable Surgical.
   challenge. A variety of procedures with varying degrees of success have
   been described, but none has proved to be the ideal. method. We have
   done 15 vaginal. reconstructions using labia minora flaps. In the first
   eight patients, we used two labia minora flaps and sutured them together
   to create a neovagina. In the last eight patients this new technique of
   vaginoptasty using horse shoe labia minora flap was used. The neovagina
   is dilated gradually for a period of 3 months and at the end of 3 months
   the patient has an adequate sized vagina. All were done for vaginal
   agenesis. Horse shoe flap vaginoplasty in Mayer,
   Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome is a new technique. The entire
   hairless skin within the labia majora is used to create a neovagina.
   Both the labia minora along with the prepucial skin of the clitoris is
   elevated as a single flap thereby increasing the dimension of the
   Neovagina and also augmenting the blood supply of the flap, making it
   more reliabte and finally the design simplifies the technique of
   suturing the neovaginal tube. (c) 2005 The British Association of

Abstract = {{Vibrio cholerae O139 emerged in 1992 as a major cause of epidemic
   cholera. However, the incidence of disease due to this new serogroup
   subsequently decreased for almost a decade. In April 2002, there was a
   dramatic resurgence of V. cholerae O139 in Bangladesh. We compared the
   phenotypic properties of the bacterial isolates and the immunological
   responses in patients with disease due to V. cholerae O139 during the
   2002 epidemic with those dating to the emergence of this disease in 1993
   to 1995. Strains isolated from patients in the two time periods were
   compared with respect to capsular polysaccharide, their resistance to
   the bactericidal effect of serum, and their capacity to be used as
   target strains in complement-mediated vibriocidal assays. Phase-contrast
   microscopy showed that strains isolated in 2002 had less capsular
   material than those isolated from 1993 to 1995 (P = <0.001), a finding
   confirmed by electron microscopic studies. Strains isolated in 2002 were
   more susceptible to the bactericidal activity of serum compared to
   strains from 1993 to 1995 (P = 0.013). Compared to results using a
   standard O139 strain, a modified vibriocidal assay utilizing a 2002
   strain, CIRS 134, as the target organism detected higher vibriocidal
   responses in both O139-infected cholera patients as well as O139 vaccine
   recipients. The vibriocidal assay utilizing the less encapsulated 2002
   strain, CIRS 134, is a more sensitive indicator of adaptive immune
   responses to recent infection with V. cholerae O139. Consequently, this
   assay may be useful in studies of both O139-infected patients and
   recipients of O139 vaccines.}},

Abstract = {{Highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies,
   formation energies, bond lengths and FTIR spectra all suggest competing
   CL-20 degradation mechanisms. This second of two studies investigates
   recalcitrant, toxic, aromatic CL-20 intermediates that absorb from 370
   to 430 nm. Our earlier study (Struct. Chem., 15, 2004) revealed that
   these intermediates were formed at high OH- concentrations via the
   chemically preferred pathway of breaking the C-C bond between the two
   cyclopentanes, thereby eliminating nitro groups, forming conjugated pi
   bonds, and resulting in a pyrazine three-ring aromatic intermediate. In
   attempting to find and make dominant a more benign CL-20 transformation
   pathway, this current research validates hydroxylation results from both
   studies and examines CL-20 transformations via photo-induced free
   radical reactions. This article discusses CL-20 competing modes of
   degradation revealed through: computational calculation; UV/VIS and SF
   spectroscopy following alkaline hydrolysis; and photochemical
   irradiation to degrade CL-20 and its byproducts at their respective
   wavelengths of maximum absorption.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies suggest that interleukin (IL)-10 pathway is involved in
   murine lupus, while no linkage of IL-10 gene polymorphism to disease
   susceptibility has been reported in studies with lupus-prone mice. Since
   IL-10 functions through the specific IL-10 receptor alpha (IL-10RA)
   chain and the IL-10RA gene (Il10ra) is linked to the susceptibility loci
   of atopic dermatitis and Crohn's disease identified using mouse models,
   we supposed that IL-10RA might be involved in murine lupus. By flow
   cytometry analysis, we found that NZW mice, one of the parental strains
   of lupus-prone (NZBxNZW) F1 mice, express extremely low levels of
   IL-10RA compared with NZB mice, the other parental strain, and the
   healthy BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Sequence analyses of Il10ra cDNA of NZW
   mice showed multiple nucleotide mutations compared with that of NZB and
   C57BL/6 strains, some of which would result in amino acid substitutions
   in the IL-10RA protein. Lupus-prone MRL mice shared the same
   polymorphism with NZW. Analyses using (NZBxNZW) F1xNZB backcross mice
   showed that high serum levels of IgG antichromatin antibodies were
   regulated by a combinatorial effect of the NZW Il10ra allele and a
   heterozygous genotype for Tnfa microsatellite locus. Our data suggest
   that the polymorphic NZW-type Il10ra may be involved in the pathologic
   production of antichromatin antibodies and, if so, may contribute in
   part to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus as one
   susceptibility allele.}},

Abstract = {{Chemokines are important mediators in immune responses and inflammatory
   processes. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is produced in dorsal
   root ganglion (DRG) neurons. In this study, CGRP radioimmunoassay was
   used to investigate whether the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL1 could trigger
   CGRP release from cultured DRG neurons of neonatal rats and, if so,
   which cellular signaling pathway was involved. The results showed that
   CCL2 and CXCL1 (similar to 5-100 ng/ml) evoked CGRP release and
   intracellular calcium elevation in a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive
   manner. The CGRP release by CCL2 and CXCL1 was significantly inhibited
   by EGTA, omega-conotoxin GVIA (an N-type calcium channel blocker),
   thapsigargin, and ryanodine. Pretreatment of DRG neurons for 30 min with
   the inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC) but
   not mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) significantly reduced
   CCL2- or CXCL1-induced CGRP release and intracellular calcium elevation.
   Intraplantar injection of CCL2 or CXCL1 produced hyperalgesia to thermal
   and mechanical stimulation in rats. These data suggest that CCL2 and
   CXCL1 can stimulate CGRP release and intracellular calcium elevation in
   DRG neurons. PLC-, PKC-, and calcium-induced calcium release from
   ryanodine-sensitive calcium stores signaling pathways are involved in
   CCL2- and CXCL1-induced CGRP release from primary nociceptive neurons,
   in which chemokines produce painful effects via direct actions on
   chemokine receptors expressed by nociceptive neurons. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the risk factors and outcome of pregnancy outside
   marriage in the 1990s, in conditions of a high percentage of
   extramarital pregnancies and high standard maternity care, used by the
   entire pregnant population.
   Design Hospital-based cohort study.
   Setting A university-teaching hospital in Finland.
   Population The 25,373 singleton pregnancies of known marital and
   cohabiting status.
   Methods Odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals were calculated
   to estimate the effect of extramarital childbearing on pregnancy
   outcome. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to control
   for confounding maternal risk factors.
   Main outcome measures Small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants, preterm
   birth (less than 37 completed weeks), low birthweight (LBW; under 2500
   g).
   Results Of the study population, 67.5\% were married and 32.5\% were
   unmarried; 24.2\% of all mothers were cohabiting. Unmarried status was
   strongly associated with social disadvantage and particular risk
   factors, specifically unemployment, smoking and previous pregnancy
   terminations, which in turn had an impact on obstetric outcome. There
   were significantly more SGA infants among unmarried mothers (P < 0.001),
   with an absolute difference of 45\%; more preterm deliveries (P= 0.001),
   with an absolute difference of 17.5\%; and more LBW infants (P < 0.001),
   with an absolute difference of 26\%. The differences in adverse
   pregnancy outcomes between study groups (i) all unmarried women, (ii)
   cohabiting women and (iii) single women, remained significant after
   multivariate analysis at adjusted ORs of 1.11, 1.11 and 1.07 for SGA,
   1.17, 1.15 and 1.21 for LBW and 1.15, 1.15 and 1.29 for the preterm
   births, respectively.
   Conclusion Even in the 1990s when cohabitation was already common,
   pregnancy outside marriage was associated with an overall 20\% increase
   of adverse outcomes, and free maternity care did not overcome the
   difference.}},

Abstract = {{Primates have more distally distributed limb muscle mass compared to
   most nonprimate mammals. The heavy distal limbs of primates are likely
   related to their strong manual and pedal grasping abilities, and
   interspecific differences in limb mass distributions among primates are
   correlated with the amount of time spent on arboreal supports. Within
   primate species, individuals at different developmental stages appear to
   differ in limb mass distribution patterns. For example infant macaques
   have more distally distributed limb mass at young ages. A shift from
   distal to proximal limb mass concentrations coincides with a shift from
   dependent travel (grasping their mother's hair) to independent
   locomotion. Because the functional demands placed on limbs may differ
   between taxa, understanding the ontogeny of limb mass distribution
   patterns is likely an essential element in interpreting the diversity of
   limb mass distribution patterns present in adult primates. This study
   examines changes in limb inertial properties during ontogeny in a
   longitudinal sample of infant baboons (Papio cynocephalus). The results
   of this study show that infant baboons undergo a transition from distal
   to proximal limb mass distribution patterns. This transition in limb
   mass distribution coincides with the transition from dependent to
   independent locomotion during infant development. Compared to more
   arboreal macaques, infant baboons undergo a faster transition to more
   proximal limb mass distribution patterns. These results suggest that
   functional demands placed on the limbs during ontogeny have a strong
   impact on the development of limb mass distribution patterns. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma is a nuclear receptor
   transcription factor that regulates cell growth, differentiation and

   obesity, diabetes, cancer and inflammation. We and others have shown
   recently that PPAR gamma agonists ameliorate experimental allergic
   encephalomyelitis (EAE), a Th1 cell-mediated autoimmune disease model of
   multiple sclerosis (MS). We have further shown that PPAR gamma agonists
   inhibit EAE through blocking IL-12 signaling leading to Th1
   differentiation and the PPAR gamma-deficient heterozygous mice (PPAR
   gamma(+/-)) develop an exacerbated EAE. In this study, we show that in
   vivo treatment (i.p.) with 100 mu g PPAR gamma antagonists, Bisphenol A
   diglycidyl ether (BADGE) or 2-Chloro-5-nitro-N-(4-pyridyl)benzamide
   (T0070907), on every other day from day 0 to 30, increased the severity

   exacerbation of EAE by PPAR gamma antagonists associates with an
   augmented neural antigen-induced T cell proliferation, IFN gamma

   PPAR gamma is a critical physiological regulator of CNS inflammation and

Abstract = {{Little is known about the chronic adaptations that take place in the
   fetal heart to allow for increased substrate delivery in response to
   chronic stress. Because glucose is an important fuel for the fetal
   cardiomyocytes, we hypothesized that myocardial glucose transporters 1
   and 4 (GLUT1 and GLUT4, respectively) are up-regulated in the fetal
   sheep heart that is chronically stressed by anemia. Fetal sheep at 128 d
   gestation underwent daily isovolumic hemorrhage and determination of
   myocardial blood flow, oxygen consumption, and substrate utilization. At
   the end of 3 or 7 d of anemia, myocardial levels of GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA
   and protein were measured and subcellular localization was determined.
   Despite stable heart rate and blood pressure, anemia caused a nearly
   4-fold increase in right and left ventricular (RV and LV) free wall
   blood flow. No significant change in myocardial glucose uptake was found
   and serum insulin levels remained stable. Both 3-d RV and LV and 7-d RV
   mRNA and protein levels of GLUT1 and GLUT4 were unchanged; 7-d LV GLUT1
   and GLUT4 mRNA levels were also stable. However, LV GLUT1 protein levels
   declined significantly, whereas LV GLUT4 protein levels were increased.
   In the steady state, GLUT4 protein localized to the sarcolemma membrane.
   These findings suggest that the glucose transporters are
   post-transcriptionally regulated in myocardium of chronically anemic
   fetal sheep with changes that mimic normal postnatal development. Unlike
   the postnatal heart, localization of GLUT4 to the cell membrane suggests
   the importance of GLUT4 in basal glucose uptake in the stressed fetal
   heart.}},

Title = {{Removal of dissolved metals by zero-valent iron (ZVI): Kinetics,

Abstract = {{Infiltration of stormwater runoff contaminated with metals is often
   questionable in several cases due to its long-term potential to cause
   deterioration of groundwater quality. To ensure the quality of filtrate,
   a pre-treatment of contaminated runoff is required. This study
   investigates the processes of copper and zinc ion removal from
   stormwater runoff using zero-valent iron (ZVI, Fe-0). Kinetic and
   equilibrium tests were performed with laboratory-prepared and in situ
   stormwater runoff samples collected from roof, street and highway
   catchments. Based on the results, a substantial portion of Cu2+ is
   reduced and transformed to insoluble forms of Cu-0 and Cu2O, Unlike
   copper, the adsorption and co-precipitation associated with freshly
   precipitated iron oxides play important roles for the removal of Zn2+.
   Investigations under various water quality conditions demonstrated a
   relatively minor impact on Cu2+ uptake rates. However, the different
   conditions apparently altered the removal stoichiometry and phases of
   the copper deposits. The removal rates of Zn2+ increase with higher
   dissolved oxygen (DO), ionic strength (IS), temperature (7) and pH.
   Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in runoff samples forms complexes with
   metals and Fe, thereby kinetically decreasing the metal uptake rates.
   Furthermore, depending on its composition, a larger molecular weight
   organic fraction was found to preferentially compete for the adsorption
   sites. The study demonstrates that ZVI is a promising medium for
   achieving comparable capacity to a commercial adsorbent like granular
   ferric hydroxide (GFH). Longterm performance of ZVI, however, may be
   limited and governed by the formation of non-conductive layers of iron
   and cuprous oxides. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The static and dynamic aspects of the Jahn-Teller (JT) interactions in

   examined in terms of the vibronic spectra and nonradiative decay
   behavior of these states. The adiabatic potential-energy surfaces of
   these degenerate electronic states are derived from extensive ab initio
   calculations. The calculated adiabatic potential-energy surfaces are
   diabatized following our earlier study on this system in its 2p(E'('))
   ground electronic state. The nuclear dynamics on the resulting conically
   intersecting manifold of electronic states is studied by a
   time-dependent wave-packet approach. Calculations are performed both for

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{705-713}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Venice Lagoon, Italy, rests on a series of aquifers that are 1,000 m
   thick. Measurements of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) were made
   in Venice Lagoon using benthic chambers vented to a plastic collection
   bag. Two hundred measurements taken in a pristine northern lagoon site
   (Isola la Cura) revealed flow rates as high as 200 cm d(-1) with an
   average of 30 cm d(-1). Over 100 measurements taken adjacent to a
   bulkhead shoreline in the Porto Marghera industrial zone (Fusina) showed
   flow rates as high as 30 cm d(-1) and averaging 6 cm d(-1). These flow
   rates, if representative of even a fraction of the lagoon floor, are
   easily able to account for the 15\% deficit previously calculated
   between precipitation and runoff for the entire Venice Lagoon drainage
   basin. Land elevation surrounding the Venice Lagoon is < 10 m within 20
   km of the shoreline and is unable to support any substantial onshore
   water table. Submarine groundwater discharge most likely represents
   upward artesian discharge from deeper partially confined aquifers. Over
   60 samples were collected in total from both sites for nutrient
   analysis. Ammonium concentration was found to be 2-8 fold higher in the
   device water than in the lagoon water at the northern site depending on
   season, and 10-30 times higher at the industrial zone site. These
   numbers suggest that SGD may be the primary pathway for nutrients and
   perhaps other contaminants to enter Venice Lagoon.}},

   proportions of algal and non-algal food items varying from 65\% of
   non-algal foods in the winter to 34\% in autumn. Observations of the
   diurnal feeding pattern of free-ranging wild fish showed an increase in
   bite rate from sunrise to late afternoon, followed by a decrease toward
   sunset. In laboratory studies we recorded (a) gut throughput rates, (b)
   macronutrient intake, and (c) macronutrient assimilation by captive G.
   tricuspidata fed one of three algal species. The algae were Enteromorpha
   intestinalis and Ulva lactuca, both of which are preferred foods of G.
   tricuspidata, and Gracilarid chilensis, which has not been recorded in
   the stomach contents of the fish despite its co-occurrence in some
   habitats. The two species of preferred algae were found to have a higher
   starch and lower protein content than the non-dietary G. chilensis. The
   fish regulated their intake and utilization of the algae such that
   similar amounts of protein were ingested and assimilated from all three
   species, but less starch was ingested and assimilated from the
   non-dietary G. chilensis than from the preferred species. Gut throughput
   times correlated positively with starch availability in the algae but
   were lower for all treatments than previous studies would suggest are
   associated with fermentative digestion. The data suggest that omnivory
   in G. tricuspidata is likely based on complementarity, rather than
   substitutability of algal and animal foods.}},

Abstract = {{Protected areas are the primary tool for in situ biodiversity
   conservation across the world. The system of protected area management
   categories defined and monitored by the World Conservation Union (IUCN)
   currently sets the standard for internationally recognized protected
   area management. IUCN unveiled this system in 1978 and revised it in
   1994. The current system of categories reflects a dramatically increased
   degree of human inhabitation and resource use in protected areas. We
   trace the history of efforts to categorize protected area management
   objectives and document a clear trend toward increasing human presence
   in them. Analyzing available data from the period 1990-2003, we test the
   hypothesis that the relative coverage of uninhabited areas has decreased
   over time. Contrary to our expectations, uninhabited protected areas
   (category la) have actually increased both absolutely and relative to
   potentially inhabited protected areas. In 1990, category I protected
   areas covered 507,908 km(2) and comprised 7.8\% of category I-V areas.
   By 2003, category la protected areas covered 1,033,888 km(2) and
   comprised 9.6\% of category I-V areas. Unfortunately, limitations in the
   availability of historical data that describe protected area coverage by
   both region and category constrain our ability to explain this trend.
   Furthermore, the process of assigning categories to protected areas is
   not transparent and may be prone to incorrect categorization.}},

Abstract = {{A crucial task in inflammation research and inflammatory drug validation
   is leukocyte velocity data collection from microscopic video imagery.
   Since manual methods are bias-prone and extremely time consuming,
   automated tracking methods are required to compute cell velocities.
   However, an automated tracking method is of little practical use unless
   it is accompanied by a mechanism to validate the tracker output. In this
   paper, we propose a validation technique that accepts or rejects the
   output of automated tracking methods. The proposed method first
   generates a spatiotemporal image from the cell locations given by a
   tracking method; then, it segments the spatiotemporal image to detect
   the presence or absence of a leukocyte. For segmenting the
   spatiotemporal images, we employ an edge-direction sensitive nonlinear
   filter followed by an active contour based technique. The proposed
   nonlinear filter, the maximum absolute average directional derivative
   (MAADD), first computes the magnitude of the mean directional derivative
   over an oriented line segment and then chooses the maximum of all such
   values within a range of orientations of the line segment. The proposed
   active contour segmentation is obtained via growing contours controlled
   by a two-dimensional force field, which is constructed by imposing a
   Dirichlet boundary condition on the gradient vector flow (GVF) field
   equations. The performance of the proposed validation method is reported
   here for the outputs of three different tracking techniques: the method
   was successful in 97\% of the trials using manual tracking, in 94\%
   using correlation tracking and in 93\% using active contour tracking.}},

Abstract = {{In the wake of September 11, authorities have increasingly focused on an
   age-old method of banking and money transfer known as ``hawala.{''} In
   this system, a local hawala dealer in one country (or area) takes money
   from a customer and (for a nominal commission) has an associate in
   another country (or area) give an equal amount of money to the
   recipient. This type of underground banking system remains resilient due
   to several key characteristics. These are: the system's simplicity, its
   inclusiveness (enabling it to function without any type of external
   support), and most importantly, its considerable prominence within, and
   adherence upon specific cultural and religious spheres. This article
   provides an overview of hawala banking, together with the historical and
   cultural milieu that gave rise to, and continues to foster it. It
   suggests that while Islam addresses the issue of debt transfer through
   the Islamic concept of hawala, the system is widely practiced through
   many parts of the world by both Muslim and non-Muslims alike. Therefore,
   to refer to the practice as wholly ``Islamic{''} is erroneous. This
   study also demonstrates that the initiatives taken towards regulation
   and/or elimination of hawala are ill suited to deal with the operation
   of this particular system. This failure particularly reflects the lack
   of appreciation, on the part of authorities and policy-makers, for the
   broader social and cultural context in which hawala opearates. A more
   insightful understanding of the system will address such issues as
   competing legal paradigms, the local appeal of the system, as well as
   the likely negative consequences of current regulatory efforts. Thus,
   any attempts at regulating hawala should ensue with great cultural and
   religious sensitivity, and should address some of the larger issues that
   continue to uphold the system, such as the existence of inadequate
   economic infrastrcture in such nations as Afghanistan and Somalia.}},

Abstract = {{A number of Swedish Studies have indicated that it is easy for underaged
   youths to purchase medium strength beer in grocery shops. The aim of
   this study was to follow the effects of a community action-based
   intervention involving information/training of parents, police, and
   shopkeepers, media advocacy, and monitoring of the sales of beer to
   underaged youths. Eighteen-year-old students, looking younger, attempted
   to purchase a six-pack of medium strength beer in grocery shops without
   showing ID. A questionnaire about perceived availability was distributed
   among ninth-grade students. Surveys of parental awareness and
   shopkeepers' attitudes were also conducted. A significant decrease in
   sales was observed in both the intervention area (from 73\% of all
   purchase attempts to 44\%) and in the comparison area (from 60\% to
   44\%). No significant difference was found between the intervention and
   the comparison areas, in part due to a contamination effect in the
   comparison area, where similar activities were conducted by the local
   community. Perceived availability by teenagers did not change. Following
   the intervention, availability to medium strength beer for young people
   in the intervention area decreased, but remained high. It is possible
   that this moderate reduction was due to the intervention but the same is
   not certain, given the developments in the comparison area. The
   intervention was primarily based on information and training, whereas a
   policy of surveillance and sanctions in the comparison area appears to
   have achieved the same result, with lesser resources. The study also
   illustrates the feasibility of engaging parents in community action for
   prevention purposes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{573-582}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative studies are necessary to determine whether invasive plant
   species displace natives and reduce local biodiversity, or if they
   increase local biodiversity. Here we describe the effects of invasion by
   Norway maple Acer platanoides on riparian plant communities and tree
   regeneration at two different scales (individual tree vs stand scales)
   in western Montana, USA, using both descriptive and experimental
   approaches. The three stands differed in community composition with the
   stand most dominated by A. platanoides invasion being more
   compositionally homogenous, and less species rich (-67\%), species even
   (-40\%), and diverse (-75\%) than the two other stands. This sharp
   decrease in community richness and diversity of the highly invaded
   stand, relative to the other stands, corresponded with a 28-fold
   increase in A. platanoides seedlings and saplings. The dramatic
   difference between stand 1 vs 2 and 3 suggests that A. platanoides
   invasion is associated with a dramatic change in community composition
   and local loss of species diversity; however, other unaccounted for
   differences between stands may be the cause. These whole-stand
   correlations were corroborated by community patterns under individual A.
   platanoides trees in a stand with intermediate levels of patchy
   invasion. At the scale of individual A. platanoides canopies within a
   matrix of native trees, diversity and richness of species beneath
   solitary A. platanoides trees declined as the size of the trees
   increased. These decreases in native community properties corresponded
   with an increase in the density of A. platanoides seedlings. The effect
   of A. platanoides at the stand scale was more dramatic than at the
   individual canopy scale; however, at this smaller scale we only
   collected data from the stand with intermediate levels of invasion and
   not from the stand with high levels of invasion. Transplant experiments
   with tree seedlings demonstrated that A. platanoides seedlings performed
   better when grown beneath conspecific canopies than under natives, but
   Populus and Pinus seedlings performed better when grown beneath Populus
   canopies, the dominant native. Our results indicate that A. platanoides
   trees suppress most native species, including the regeneration of the
   natural canopy dominants, but facilitate conspecifics in their
   understories.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of new blood vessels plays an important role in human
   disease development and progression. For instance, it is well
   established that the growth of most cancers critically depends on the
   supply of nutrition and oxygen by newly recruited blood vessels.
   Similarly, malignant gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors
   occurring in humans are highly dependent on angiogenesis. In recent
   years, there has been tremendous effort to uncover the molecular
   mechanisms that drive blood vessel growth in adult tissues, especially
   during cancer progression. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
   other morphogens, such as angiopoietins and ephrins have been shown to
   be critically involved in the formation of new blood vessels during both
   developmental and pathological angiogenesis as evidenced by genetic
   studies in mice. in this review, we focus on angiopoietins, a family of
   growth factor ligands binding to Tie tyrosine kinase receptors with
   emphasis on their functional consequences during the growth and
   progression of experimental tumors and malignant human gliomas.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Exact categorization of soft tissue tumours (STTs) on smears
   requires application of various ancillary techniques. This study was
   aimed at evaluating the role of fluorescent immunocytochemistry (FICC)
   in cyto-diagnosis of 30 STT cases.
   Methods: Thirty cases of soft tissue tumours were included in the
   present study. All cases were subjected to routine Giemsa and
   Papanicolaou stain. Extra smears were made and kept for fluorescent
   immunostaining. A panel of cytoskeletal antibodies, tagged with FITC
   (Fluorescein isothyocynate), was employed in all these cases.
   Fluorescent immunostained smears were examined under Zeiss Confocal
   Laser scanning microscope, using double immunofluorescence (red-green).
   Finally, all cases were subjected to biopsy and again immunoperoxidase
   staining.
   Results: Among the 30 cases in the present study, unaided cytological
   diagnoses ranged from ` spindle cell ` tumour in four (13.3\%) cases,
   benign and malignant spindle cell tumour in 17 (56.6\%) cases, to
   malignant mesenchymal tumour in nine (30\%) cases. FICC helped in
   further correct categorization of 25/30 (83.3\%) cases viz. leiomyoma
   (three), benign neurogenic tumour (six), schwannoma (one),
   dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (three), synovial sarcoma (two),
   rhabdomyosarcoma (two), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (five) and
   malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (three). Aggressive
   fibromatosis was found to be a missed diagnosis in two cases. Overall
   concordance between cyto-diagnosis with FICC, and histopathology results
   was 83.3\% (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Fluorescent immunocytochemistry is a significant ancillary
   technique for making a rapid and specific diagnosis of STT, as required
   for their timely management. Incorporation of a wide panel of antibody
   markers with clinico-cytological correlation is recommended in forming
   an exact diagnosis in these cases.}},

Journal = {{SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Models of codon substitution have been commonly used to compare
   protein-coding DNA sequences and are particularly effective in detecting
   signals of natural selection acting on the protein. Their utility in
   reconstructing molecular phylogenies and in dating species divergences
   has not been explored. Codon models naturally accommodate synonymous and
   nonsynonymous substitutions, which occur at very different rates and may
   be informative for recent and ancient divergences, respectively. Thus
   codon models may be expected to make an efficient use of phylogenetic
   information in protein-coding DNA sequences. Here we applied codon
   models to 106 protein-coding genes from eight yeast species to
   reconstruct phylogenies using the maximum likelihood method, in
   comparison with nucleotide- and amino acid-based analyses. The results
   appeared to confirm that expectation. Nucleotide-based analysis, under
   simplistic substitution models, were efficient in recovering recent
   divergences whereas amino acid-based analysis performed better at
   recovering deep divergences. Codon models appeared to combine the
   advantages of amino acid and nucleotide data and had good performance at
   recovering both recent and deep divergences. Estimation of relative
   species divergence times using amino acid and codon models suggested
   that translation of gene sequences into proteins led to information loss
   of from 30\% for deep nodes to 66\% for recent nodes. Although
   computational burden makes codon models unfeasible for tree search in
   large data sets, we suggest that they may be useful for comparing
   candidate trees. Nucleotide models that accommodate the differences in
   evolutionary dynamics at the three codon positions also performed well,
   at much less computational cost. We discuss the relationship between a
   model's fit to data and its utility in phylogeny reconstruction and
   caution against use of overly complex substitution models.}},

Abstract = {{We present a vision-based performance interface for controlling animated
   human characters. The system interactively combines information about
   the user's motion contained in silhouettes from three viewpoints with
   domain knowledge contained in a motion capture database to produce an
   animation of high quality. Such an interactive system might be useful
   for authoring, for teleconferencing, or as a control interface for a
   character in a game. In our implementation, the user performs in front
   of three video cameras; the resulting silhouettes are used to estimate
   his orientation and body configuration based on a set of discriminative
   local features. Those features are selected by a machine-learning
   algorithm during a preprocessing step. Sequences of motions that
   approximate the user's actions are extracted from the motion database
   and scaled in time to match the speed of the user's motion. We use swing
   dancing, a complex human motion, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   approach. We compare our results to those obtained with a set of global
   features, Hu moments, and ground truth measurements from a motion

   angle pairs showed little linearity for the impaired arm, indicating
   more segmented movements of shoulder and elbow. It was also found that
   coordination patterns between elbow, shoulder, and trunk displayed less

Abstract = {{A new tectonic interpretation of Sainte-Victoire Mountain, France. The
   explanation normally given for the tectonics of Sainte-Victoire
   Mountain, a dozen kilometres east of Aix-en-Provence, to the north of
   the limestone Provence, is incorrect. To the east, the morphology of the
   Sainte-Victoire is subdued, whereas to the west, before the mountain
   breaks savagely, the morphology is that of a young mountain as appears
   in Alpine landscapes. This unusual aspect in the region and the large
   subvertical faults with vertically striated surfaces that mark the
   massif to the south and to the west, induce the idea of strong vertical
   uplifts and caste doubt on the tectonic interpretation given in 1962 by
   Corroy et al. According to those authors, the Sainte-Victoire is a unit
   of Jurassic and Cretaceous formations overthrusting 1800 m to the south
   conglomerates of the Late Cretaceous or Palaeocene. New observations
   about the conglomerate transgression over the Jurassic and Cretaceous
   beds, and about the faults around and on the massif do not give evidence
   of an overthrusting but, on the contrary, induce the idea of a uplift,
   perhaps still active, in the form of a `piano key' inclined to the
   northeast.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Structural brain volume abnormalities are among the most
   extensively studied endophenotypes in schizophrenia. Bivariate genetic
   model fitting (adjusted to account for selection) was used to quantify
   the genetic relationship between schizophrenia and brain volumes and to
   estimate the heritability of these volumes.
   Method. We demonstrated by simulation that the adjusted genetic model
   produced unbiased estimates for endophenotype heritability and the
   genetic and environmental correlations. The model was applied to brain
   volumes (whole brain, hippocampus, third and lateral ventricles) in a
   sample of 14 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs concordant for schizophrenia,
   10 MZ discordant pairs, 17 MZ control pairs, 22 discordant sibling
   pairs, three concordant sibling pairs, and 114 healthy control subjects.
   Results. Whole brain showed a Substantial heritability (88\%) and
   lateral ventricles substantial common environmental effects (67\%).
   Whole brain showed a significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia,
   whereas lateral ventricles showed a significant individual specific
   correlation with schizophrenia. There were significant familial effects
   for hippocampus and third ventricle, but the analyses could not resolve
   whether these were genetic or environmental in origin (around 30\%
   each).
   Conclusions. Using genetic model fitting on twin and sibling data we
   have demonstrated differential sources of covariation between
   schizophrenia and brain volumes, genetic in the case of whole brain
   volume and individual specific environment in the case of lateral
   ventricles.}},

Abstract = {{According to Paton, sport management research went through several
   phases up to the 1990s: a praxis phase, based upon ``administrative
   principles, usually developed by authorities in the field, and upon
   program planning in physical education{''}; a second more theory-based
   phase that continues to the present; and a third descriptive phase
   (Paton, 1987, p. 26). In most of this research, however, the use of
   methodological innovation in research and in reporting research has been
   relatively scarce (as in many of the subdisciplines in physical
   education/kinesiology). In the present article, I argue for the use of
   personal narrative and personal storytelling in sport management
   research methodology, which might result in the asking of different
   questions and in write-ups that could serve to invigorate sport
   management studies. This method of research answers different,
   interactionist-based questions for researchers delving into how sport
   management affects people and how sport managers interact with others.
   In other words, this method examines how lives are lived into existence,
   and it provides models for practitioners and scholars of sport
   management to model, discover, experience, and use.}},

Abstract = {{Optical mammography is one of several new techniques for breast cancer
   detection and characterization presently under development for clinical
   use that provide information other than morphologic, in particular on
   the biochemical and metabolic state of normal and diseased tissue. In
   breast tissue, scattering of red to near infrared (NIR) light dominates
   absorption and NIR light may penetrate several centimeters through the
   breast. Optical mammography avoids the use of ionizing radiation and
   offers the power of diffuse optical spectroscopy. However, because of
   strong light scattering, spatial resolution of optical mammography is
   generally low. The paper reviews the results of a clinical study on
   scanning time-domain optical mammography comprising 154 patients
   carrying a total of 102 carcinomas validated by histology. Ninety two of
   these tumors were detected in optical mammograms retrospectively and for
   87 of the detected tumors optical properties and tissue parameters were
   derived. In addition developments on instrumentation and data analysis
   are covered and possible improvements of optical mammography are briefly
   discussed.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We perform an extensive numerical investigation on the retrieval
   dynamics of the synchronous Hopfield model, also known as
   Little-Hopfield model, up to sizes of 2(18) neurons. Our results correct
   and extend much of the early simulations on the model. We find that the
   average convergence time has a power law behavior for a wide range of
   system sizes, whose exponent depends both on the network loading and the
   initial overlap with the memory to be retrieved. Surprisingly, we also
   find that the variance of the convergence time grows as fast as its
   average, making it a non-self-averaging quantity. Based on the
   simulation data we differentiate between two definitions for memory
   retrieval time, one that is mathematically strict, tau(c), the number of
   updates needed to reach the attractor whose properties we just
   described, and a second definition correspondent to the time tau(eta)
   when the network stabilizes within a tolerance threshold eta such that
   the difference of two consecutive overlaps with a stored memory is
   smaller that eta. We show that the scaling relationships between tau(c)
   and tau(eta) and the typical network parameters as the memory load alpha
   or the size of the network N vary greatly, being tau(eta) relatively
   insensitive to system sizes and loading. We propose tau(eta) as the
   physiological realistic measure for the typical attractor network
   response.}},

Abstract = {{The arrival of the Russian Army of General Wrangel in Constantinople in
   November 1920 created a major humanitarian crisis, and led to severe
   disputes as to which organisation should take the lead in providing aid
   to Russian refugees. The leaders of both Zemgor and the Russian Army
   sought this position for themselves, and relations between the two very
   rapidly became very poor. Both imagined themselves as apolitical, but in
   fact represented very different political ideals, and opposed the claims
   of the other for political reasons, realising that control of
   humanitarian aid would give them political leadership over the Russian
   emigration. This article analyses the relationship between these two
   very different organisations during the early years of the emigration,
   and sheds light on how they and their members adapted to the
   circumstances of exile. It reveals that the provision of aid in this era
   was as much a political as a humanitarian issue.}},

Abstract = {{Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a disorder in which platelet
   microthrombi are formed that have a particular propensity to deposit in
   the kidney microvasculature, resulting in impaired renal function and
   thrombocytopenia. The mechanism of formation of these microthrombi is
   not known. In this study, we showed that plasma from five adult and six
   paediatric cases of HUS caused aggregation and release of adenosine
   triphosphate from normal platelets. The plasma reacted against platelet
   lysate in a protein blot and all samples showed reactivity against a
   band at 88 kDa, corresponding to the membrane antigen CD36. This was
   confirmed by probing with Mo91, a monoclonal antibody to CD36. CD36 was
   also identified in the immune complex formed by incubation of patient
   plasmas with normal platelet lysate. In other studies, bands of 32 and
   7.7 kDa were obtained when purified verotoxin was protein blotted and
   probed with either patient plasma or with anti-CD36 antibody Mo91
   suggesting structural homologies between CD36 and verotoxin. While a
   direct cause-effect relationship is not yet established, the data
   support the concept of an immunological pathogenesis for HUS and suggest
   that molecular mimicry involving one or both of the homologous domains
   in membrane-bound CD36 and verotoxin lead to the development of
   antibodies capable of inducing the pathophysiological events
   characteristic of HUS.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Outpatient intravenous sedation by properly trained personnel
   provides a safe, cost-effective means of anesthesia for numerous
   surgical procedures. The goal of this study was to provide a 7-year
   summary (December 1994 through November 2001) of anesthesia-related
   problems that occurred in the practice of a single Midwestern
   board-certified oral and maxillofacial surgeon.
   Methods: The files of intravenous sedation cases from December 1994
   through November 2001 were organized retrospectively.
   Results: A total of 2,889 sedations were performed by the surgeon during
   the 7-year period. There were 1,743 (about 60.33\%) patients in ASA
   Class I, 1,139 (about 39.43\%) in ASA Class II, and 7 (about 0.24\%) in
   ASA Class III. There were a total of 70 patients who had 77 adverse
   events. Less than 3\% of the sedation patients experienced
   complications. There were no deaths and no patients required emergency
   transport to a hospital.
   Conclusions: The administration of intravenous sedation by the operating
   surgeon for outpatient oral surgery procedures is safe and results in a
   low incidence of adverse events. In this series, a number of previously
   undiagnosed medical problems were discovered. The diagnosis and referral
   for management of these medical problems improved patient health. (c)

Abstract = {{Myo-inositol-1,2.3,4,5.6-hexakisphosphate, also known as phytate, is a
   natural metal chelate present in cereals, an important feedstock
   worldwide. This article reports the characterization of three metal
   storage model complexes: the homometallic Mn(II)
   myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (IP6), the heterometallic
   Zn(II), Mn(II) analogue Na4MnZn4(C6H6O24P6) (NO3)(2)-8H(2)O (MnZn(4)IP6)
   and the homometallic Zn(II) metal complex Na3Zn5(C6H6O24P6)OH-9H(2)O
   (Zn(5)IP6). The techniques of high-resolution Na-23, C-13 and P-31 NMR,
   electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) were applied in this study. The complexation of
   Zn(II) and Mn(II) by phosphate groups of IP6 is demonstrated by NMR and
   XPS results. C-13 NMR results show a conformation for IP6 consisting of
   five equatorial phosphate groups to one axial group showing only one
   chemical environment for Zn and two for Mn, when characterized by XPS
   and EPR, in both Mn complexes. These results support, for the first
   time, a probable supramacromolecular structure for phytate complexes of
   transition metals. Based on the similarity between the EPR spectra of
   wheat seeds and that of the MnZn(4)IP6 compound, the manganese storage
   centers in wheat grains can be assigned to similar heterometallic
   phytate complexes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As there is a constant need to assess the biodegradation potential of
   refuse disposed of in landfills, we have developed a method to evaluate
   the biodegradability of cellulosic compounds (cellulose and
   hemicellulose) in municipal solid waste. This test is based on the
   quantification of monosaccharides released after the hydrolysis of solid
   waste samples with an optimised enzyme preparation containing
   commercially available cellulases and hemicellulases. We show that the
   amounts of monosaccharides could be related to the biodegradability of
   the cellulosic material contained in the samples. This enzymatic
   cellulose degradation test was assayed on 37 samples originating from
   three Belgian landfills and collected at different depths. As results
   correlated well with those obtained with a classical biochemical methane
   potential assay, this new and rapid test is sufficiently reliable to
   evaluate cellulose bioavailability in waste samples.}},

Abstract = {{Ensemble prediction has become an indispensable tool in weather
   forecasting. One of the issues in ensemble prediction is that,
   regardless of the method, the prediction error does not map well to the
   underlying physics (i.e., error estimates do not project strongly onto
   physical structures). This paper is driven by the hypothesis that
   prediction error includes a deterministic component, which can be
   isolated and then removed, and that removing the error would enable
   researchers and forecasters to better map the error to the physics and
   improve prediction of atmospheric transitions. Here, preliminary
   experimental evidence is provided that supports this hypothesis. This
   evidence is provided from results obtained from two low-order but highly
   chaotic systems, one of which incorporates atmospheric flow transitions.
   Using neural networks to probe the deterministic component of forecast
   error, it is shown that the error recovery relates to the underlying
   type of flow and that it can be used to better forecast transitions in
   the atmospheric flow using ensemble data. A discussion of methods to
   extend these ideas to more realistic forecast settings is provided.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolic syndrome (MS) has been implicated as an important
   nonimmunologic risk factor for chronic renal transplant dysfunction. The
   aim of this study was to determine the impact of the MS on outcomes in
   simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation (SKPT). Data were available
   on 241 patients enrolled in a prospective, multicenter randomized study
   of daclizumab compared with no antibody induction in SKPT. Presence of
   MS before and after SKPT was defined using NCEP-ATP III (National
   Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III) criteria. Body
   mass index (BMI) was used as a surrogate for waist circumference. MS was
   present in 59\% of patients pretransplantation but only in 19\% of
   patients 1 year after SKPT (P < .0001). Demographic and transplant
   characteristics were well matched for those with MS (MS+) and without MS
   (MS-) at 1 year. Presence of MS at 1 year was associated with the
   following changes at 3 years: increased serum creatinine level (1.65
   mg/dL MS- vs 2.05 mg/dL MS divided by; P = .13); decreased modification
   of diet in renal disease calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR; 58
   mL/min MS- vs 48 mL/min MS+; P = .02); increased HgbA1C level (5.6\% MS-
   vs 6.6\% MS+; P < .001); and lower pancreas graft (PG) survival rate
   (88\% MS- vs 71\% MS+; P = .01). Linear regression analysis identified
   MS+ and the subgroup of MS+ without functioning PG at 1 year as
   independent risk factors for renal dysfunction, whereas MS+ with
   functioning PG at 1 year was not a risk factor for renal dysfunction.
   Presence of MS at 1 year is associated with long-term renal dysfunction
   after SKPT. Efforts to decrease early PG failure may help mitigate
   against MS-associated renal dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{CD80 and CD86 are important in the initiation of T cell immunity.
   Although their costimulatory function has long been appreciated, it
   remains unclear whether the biological significance of the two B7
   isoforms resides in their different patterns and kinetics of expression
   or whether differences exist in their function. We have addressed this
   issue using HLA-DR1 transfectants co-expressing CD80, CD86, or both
   molecules as stimulators for naive, memory, and activated human CD4(+) T
   cells. Both CD80 and CD86 efficiently costimulated alloresponses by
   unseparated peripheral blood CD4+ T cells; however, CD86 was
   substantially inferior in costimulating alloresponses by separated
   memory T cells, and completely incompetent in costimulating three human
   T cell clones. Furthermore, CD80/CD86 double transfectants stimulated
   lower responses by the clones than cells expressing CD80 alone. That
   CD86 was actively inhibitory rather than merely neutral was evidenced by
   the increase in response to the double CD80/CD86 APC when anti-CD86
   antibody was added. Furthermore, addition of anti-CTLA-4 Fab to cultures
   of HLA-DR1 transfectants co-expressing CD86, fully restored the
   proliferative response. These results indicate that CD80 and CD86
   mediate distinct signals in previously activated T cells, and
   demonstrate that CTLA-4 ligation may dominate the outcome of
   CD86-mediated costimulation of activated CD4(+) T cells.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the behaviour of an asynchronous optical buffer by means
   of a continuous-time queuing model. Through a limit procedure,
   previously obtained results for a discrete-time queuing model are

   results can be obtained by a direct analysis using Laplace transforms.
   Closed-form expressions are obtained for the cases of exponentially
   distributed burst sizes, deterministic burst sizes and mixtures of
   deterministic burst sizes.
   The performance of asynchronous optical buffers shows the same
   characteristics as that of synchronous optical buffers: a reduction in
   throughput due to the creation of voids on the outgoing channel and a
   burst loss probability that is strongly influenced by the choice of
   fiber delay line granularity. The optimal value of the latter depends on
   the burst size distribution and the offered load. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

   GnRH through endothelin type A receptors and by stimulating their
   proliferation through endothelin type B (ETB) receptors. In this study,
   we found that FNC-B4 cells are able to migrate in response to ET-1
   through the involvement of ETB receptors. Combined immunohistochemical
   and biochemical analyses showed that ET-1 triggered actin cytoskeletal
   remodeling and a dose-dependent increase in migration (up to 6-fold).
   Whereas the ETB receptor antagonist (B-BQ788) blunted the ET-1-induced
   effects, the ETA receptor antagonist (A-BQ123) did not. Moreover, we
   observed that FNC-B4 cells were independently and selectively stimulated
   by ET-1 and GnRH. We suggest that ET-1, through ETB receptor activation,
   may be required to maintain an adequate proliferative stem cell pool in
   the developing olfactory epithelium and the subsequent commitment to
   GnRH neuronal migratory pattern. The coordinate interaction between ET
   receptors and GnRH receptor participates in the fully expressed
   GnRH-secreting neuron phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate DNA replication is one of the most important events in the life
   of a cell. To perform this task, the cell utilizes several DNA
   polymerase complexes. We investigated the role of DNA polymerase F
   during gametophyte and seed development using forward and reverse
   genetic approaches. In Arabidopsis, the catalytic subunit of this
   complex is encoded by two genes, AtPOL2a and AtPOL2b, whereas the second
   largest regulatory subunit AtDPB2 is present as a unique complete copy.
   Disruption of AtPOL2a or AtDPB2 resulted in a sporophytic
   embryo-defective phenotype, whilst mutations in AtPOL2b produced no
   visible effects. Loss of AtDPB2 function resulted in a severe reduction
   in nuclear divisions, both in the embryo and in the endosperm. Mutations
   in AtPOL2a allowed several rounds of mitosis to proceed, often with
   aberrant planes of division. Moreover, AtDPB2 was not expressed during
   development of the female gametophyte, which requires three post-meiotic
   nuclear divisions. Since a consensus binding site for E2F transcription
   factors was identified in the promoter region of both genes, the
   promoter-reporter fusion technique was used to show that luciferase
   activity was increased at specific phases of the cell cycle in
   synchronized tobacco BY-2 cells. Our results support the idea that
   fertilization may utilize the mechanisms of cell cycle transcriptional
   regulation of genes to reactivate the divisions of the oosphere and
   central cell.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) is a hallmark of tumor
   invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Based on the Rath multitargeted
   approach to cancer using natural substances to control ECM stability and
   enhancing its strength, we developed a novel formulation (NM) of lysine,
   proline, ascorbic acid and green tea extract that has shown significant
   anti-cancer activity against a number of cancer cell lines. The aim of
   the present study was to determine whether NM exhibits anti-angiogenic
   and anti-metastatic effects using in vitro and in vivo experimental
   models. Angiogenesis was measured using a chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)
   assay in chick embryos and bFGF-induced vessel growth in C57BL/6J female
   mice. To determine the in vivo effect of NM on the tumor xenograft
   growth, male nude mice were inoculated with 3x10(6) MNNG-HOS cells.
   Control mice were fed a mouse chow diet, while the test group was fed a
   mouse chow diet supplemented with 0.5\% NM for 4 weeks. In vitro studies
   on cell proliferation (MTT assay), MMP expression (zymography) and
   Matrigel invasion were conducted on human osteosarcoma U2OS, maintained
   in McCoy medium, supplemented with 10\% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin
   in 24-well tissue culture plates and tested with NM at 0, 10, 50, 100,
   500, and 1000 mu g/ml in triplicate at each dose. NM at 250 mu g/ml
   caused a significant (p<0.05) reduction in bFGF-induced angiogenesis in
   CAM. NM inhibited tumor growth of osteosarcoma MNNG-HOS cell xenografts
   in nude mice by 53\%; furthermore, tumors in NM-treated mice were less
   vascular and expressed lower levels of VEGF and MMP-9
   immunohistochemically than tumors in the control group. In addition, NM
   exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of osteosarcoma U20S cell
   proliferation (up to 60\% at 1000 mu g/ml), MMP-2 and -9 expression
   (with virtual total inhibition at 500 mu g/ml NM), and invasion through
   Matrigel (with total inhibition at 100 mu g/ml NM). Moreover, NM
   decreased U20S cell expression of VEGF, angiopoietin-2, bFGF, PDGF and
   TGF beta-1. These results together with our earlier findings suggest
   that NM is a relatively non-toxic formulation, which inhibits growth,
   invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of tumor cells.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare energy requirements and substrate use for running a

   males and four females who were moderately endurance trained (32 +/- 6

   VO2max 62.0 +/- 6.0 mL center dot min(-1)center dot kg(-1); individual
   anaerobic threshold {[}IAT]: 13.7 +/- 1.4 km center dot h(-1)) performed
   all incremental running protocol to determine IAT. Subsequently, two
   8000-m runs at 70 and 95\% IAT were performed on separate days in
   randomized order on all indoor track. Energy expenditure (EE) was
   measured by means of a portable metabolic device (indirect calorimetry).
   A meaningful difference in EE was defined as > 10\%. Results: EE was
   significantly greater during the 95\% IAT run than during the 70\% IAT
   run (2650 +/- 276 and 2554 +/- 348 kJ, respectively). However, this
   difference was only 3.8 +/- 4.8\%. Including measurements up to 10 min
   postexercise, the difference rose to 5.1 +/- 4.7\% (95\% IAT: 2830 +/-
   301 kJ: 70\% IAT: 2692 +/- 368 kJ). There was no significant difference
   between tile absolute amounts of fat oxidized during the runs (70\% IAT:
   26 +/- 5 g; 95\% IAT: 20 +/- 5 g). During the 95\% IAT run,
   significantly more carbohydrates were metabolized than during the 70\%
   IAT run (108 +/- 14 and 90 +/- 15 g, respectively). The difference in EE
   between the two runs increased from the first to the third part of the
   running distance (first: no significance: second: P < 0.01: third: P <
   0.001). Conclusion: Energy requirements for a commonly ran distance in
   recreational endurance training differ significantly but not relevantly
   between slow and fast speeds. However, increasing total running distance
   might lead to larger differences.}},

Abstract = {{1 Eidothea hardeniana (Proteaceae) is a narrow endemic representative of
   an ancient lineage restricted to a single site in northern New South
   Wales (Australia). This study aims to identify the life-history traits
   most likely to have influenced the current distribution pattern of this
   rain forest tree.
   2 Using ecological and molecular analyses we found that its range is
   limited by the absence of efficient dispersal mechanisms rather than by
   habitat availability, or as a result of a recent bottleneck or of
   reproductive failure.
   3 Resprouts can take over the position of senesced plants, even in the
   absence of disturbance, allowing local persistence and the maintenance
   of genetic diversity. Long-term persistence and preferential outcrossing
   further favour relatively high levels of diversity (H-E = 0.542) despite
   a small effective population size (N-e = 21.6).
   4 We used eight life-history traits to assess if the E. hardeniana
   findings were valid across 258 local taxa. Current distribution patterns
   of rain forest species within a species-rich community were accounted
   for by linking two important components of community assembly theory:
   dispersal and niche assembly.
   5 The interaction of the seed-based dispersal dimension and resprouting
   potential best explains the current distribution of rare local taxa.
   Major dimensions of life-history trait variation were identified among
   local plant species, suggesting that a range of interacting traits
   contribute to a species' response to environmental variables and
   mitigate the influence of potentially adverse circumstances.
   6 The benefits of merging ecological and genetic approaches to interpret
   species distribution and population structure are applicable across a
   broader range of studies. Our findings highlight how currently
   constrained palaeo-endemic species with small populations in refugial
   habitats may retain the capacity to both persist and expand in response
   to changing circumstances and opportunities. This has important
   implications for species conservation, habitat management and reserve
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Major depression is a common psychiatric disorder in the
   elderly population. The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants is well
   established, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear to have
   a similar effectiveness along with advantages in terms of tolerability
   and safety. Given the lack of literature data regarding fluvoxamine in
   the treatment of depressed elderly patients, the aim of the present
   study was to compare its efficacy and tolerability with those of
   sertraline in a sample of elderly patients.
   Methods: Under double-blind conditions, 93 hospitalized patients older
   than 59 years, who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
   Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for a major depressive episode, were
   randomly assigned to receive sertraline (150 mg daily) or fluvoxamine
   (200 mg daily) for 7 weeks. The clinical response was defined as a
   reduction on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score to 8 or
   below.
   Results: At study completion, the response rates were 55.6\% (25/45) and
   71.8\% (28/39) for sertraline and fluvoxamme, respectively. No
   significant difference in final response rates was found between the 2
   treatment groups (P = 0.12). A repeated-measures analysis of variance on
   Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores revealed a significantly
   different decrease of depressive symptoms between the 2 treatment
   groups, favoring fluvoxamine (P = 0.007). The overall safety profile of
   sertraline and fluvoxamine was favorable with no differences between the
   2 drugs.
   Conclusion: The results of this double-blind trial show that sertraline
   and fluvoxamine may be effective compounds in the treatment of elderly
   depression with the latter showing some advantage in terms of speed of
   response. These findings warrant further replication in
   placebo-controlled studies.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to predict severity of the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)
   early after acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is limited. The aim of our
   study was to examine the incidence of PTS prospectively and to evaluate
   the predictive value of non-invasive venous examinations shortly after
   DVT for the development of PTS. In 93 patients with DVT thrombosis score
   (TS), reflux, venous outflow resistance (VOR) and calf muscle pump
   dysfunction (CMP) were examined prospectively. After one,two and six
   years patients were evaluated for PTS using the clinical scale of the
   CEAP-classification (PTS present >= 3 on a scale from 0 to 6). Area
   under the curves (AUC) were used to evaluate the predictive value of the
   non-invasive examinations at one and three months after diagnosis of DVT
   for future PTS. The cumulative incidence of PTS increased from 49\%
   (32/65) after one year to 55\% (36/65) and 56\% (27/48) after two and
   six years, whereas the incidence of patients with PTS class 4 progressed
   from 20\% after two years to 33\% after six years. The prognostic value
   to predict PTS was highest for the combination of TS, YOR and reflux
   measured three months after diagnosis and showed an AUC of 0.77
   (0.65-0.90) for PTS after one year. In conclusion,the incidence of PTS
   after DVT did not increase significantly after one year,whereas during
   longer follow-up the severity of PTS rose in patients with PTS.
   Moreover, measurement of TS,VOR and reflux three months after DVT could
   predict, with reasonable accuracy, the risk of PTS after one year of
   follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Liberal theorists and, more recently, constructivists have argued that a
   shared sense of identity will decrease threat perception and increase
   international cooperation. But what processes lead to the emergence (or

   experiments of identity change and societal-level theories of idea
   diffusion from the constructivist literature, the authors develop an
   agent-based computer simulation of identity change. Four findings emerge
   from the analysis: (1) there is a curvilinear relationship between the
   complexity of agents' views and the emergence of shared identity, (2)
   highly unstable environments encourage the emergence of a shared
   identity, (3) the presence of leaders (i.e., agents with greater
   influence in the population) in the neighborhood decreases shared
   identity, and (4) the interaction of complexity, stability, and

   patch antennas with the aspect ratios varied from 0.5 to 2, both
   theoretical and experimental investigations of the proposed technique
   are carried out. From the obtained results, it is shown that, to acquire
   the 50 Omega input impedance, the position of the through hole is only
   related to the length of the radiating edge of the patch antenna.
   Details of the antenna design are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric radiation flux measurements and the resulting surface
   radiation budget are important quantities for greenhouse effect and
   climate change investigations. Accurate net shortwave and longwave
   fluxes, in conjunction with numerical algorithms, also allow monitoring
   of the radiative effect of clouds and the nowcasting of the cloud
   amount. To achieve certain advantages on the accuracy of flux
   measurements a new instrument is developed that measures downward and
   upward shortwave and longwave radiation with the same sensors. Two
   high-quality instruments-a pyranometer for shortwave and a pyrgeometer
   for longwave measurements-are mounted on a pivotable sensor head, which
   is rotated up and down in 70-min intervals. To keep the instrument domes
   free from dew and ice, and to minimize the pyranometer thermal offset,
   both sensors are ventilated with slightly heated air. Additionally, a
   ventilated temperature and humidity sensor is integrated in the new
   instrument. The combination of measurements of radiation fluxes,
   temperature, and humidity allows for instrument use for autonomous and
   automatic cloud amount detection. The Temperature, Humidity, Radiation
   and Clouds (TURAC) sensor has been successfully tested under harsh
   alpine winter conditions, as well as under moderate lowland conditions.
   Comparisons to reference instruments showed all radiation fluxes to be
   within a maximum bias and rms difference of 1.6\% or 1.4 W m(-2) on
   daily averages.}},

Abstract = {{Nurses routinely report using intuition to guide decisions about patient
   care, although they use it covertly because of difficulty explaining the
   sources of their intuitions to colleagues. To help nurse educators guide
   students toward open discussion and appropriate use of intuition, this
   study compared personal, interpersonal, and professional experiences
   suggested by past research for their association with the use of
   intuition by nurses. A questionnaire completed by 323 novice nurses
   measured use of intuition with an 18-item subscale identified by Miller
   from the Miller Intuitiveness Instrument. Measures of personal
   experience included age, gender, hospitalizations, self-esteem, and
   religiosity. Interpersonal experience included parenthood and social
   support from family and friends. Professional experience included grade
   point average and months of on-the-job experience. Multiple regression
   revealed that novice nurses use intuition more to guide patient care if
   they are older, have had more hospitalizations, and experience more
   social support.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional numerical model was used for calculating the
   velocity and bed level changes over time in a 90 degrees bended channel.
   The numerical model solved the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations
   in three dimensions to compute the water flow and used the finite-volume
   method as the discretization scheme. The k-epsilon model predicted the
   turbulence, and the SIMPLE method computed the pressure. The suspended
   sediment transport was calculated by solving the convection diffusion
   equation and the bed load transport quantity was determined with an
   empirical formula. The model was enhanced with relations for the
   movement of sediment particles on steep side slopes in river bends.
   Located on a transversally sloping bed, a sediment particle has a lower
   critical shear stress than on a flat bed. Also, the direction of its
   movement deviates from the direction of the shear stress near the bed.
   These phenomenona are considered to play an important role in the
   morphodynamic process in sharp channel bends. The calculated velocities
   as well as the bed changes over time were compared with data from a
   physical model study and good agreement was found.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomic nervous control of the heart can be studied by analysing
   variability in heart rate. Although earlier studies have shown reduced
   variability in patients with the Fontan circulation, we are not aware of
   any previous study examining longitudinal changes in such children. We
   have examined 13 patients who had undergone total cavopulmonary
   connection, and 37 healthy controls matched for age and gender. The
   examinations included complete echocardiography, and 24-hour ambulatory
   electrocardiogram for analysis of the parameters for variability in
   heart rate. After the Fontan procedure, three follow-up examinations
   were performed at a mean of 4.4 years, 5.6 and 7.2 years. Reduced
   variability was found in those with the Fontan circulation. A
   significant difference was found between patients and their controls
   with respect to high-ftequency power at the second, p equal to 0.05, and
   third, p equal to 0.03, examination. The ratio of low-to-high-frequency
   components progressively increased in those with the Fontan circulation,
   a phenomenon that led to a significant difference, p equal to 0.03, at
   the third examination. Our study shows that, in patients with the Fontan
   circulation, routine ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring
   including analysis of variability in heart rate, detects over time a
   progressive sympatovagal imbalance.}},

Abstract = {{Arsenic trioxide has recently been shown to inhibit growth and induce
   apoptosis in a variety of hematologic malignancies, but very little is
   known about its effects on solid tumors and especially on neuroblastoma
   cells that have self-differentiating characteristics. To demonstrate the
   growth inhibition induced in neuroblastoma cells (the SH-SY5Y and
   SK-N-AS cell line) and acute promyelocytic Leukemia cells (HL-60) by
   arsenic trioxide (As2O3), the viable cell numbers were counted after
   trypan blue staining. Apoptosis was assessed by the cell morphology, by
   flow cytometry with annexin-V staining, and by Western blot analysis for
   the apoptosis-related proteins (bcl-2 and PARP). To decide the dose for
   the clinical application of As2O3, normal peripheral blood lymphocytes
   were also examined. The growth and survival of the SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS
   cells were markedly inhibited by As2O3 treatment at a 3 mu M
   concentration before the changes of the normal lymphocytes were
   observed. The apoptotic cells showed,a shrunken cell nucleus, and an
   increase in the number and balloon-like swelling of the mitochondria at
   72 h after the As2O3 was added. Apoptosis of the annexin-V-positive cell
   proportion in the neuroblastoma cell lines was increased with increasing
   the exposure time and the concentration of As2O3, just like the HL-60
   cells. Bcl-2 downregulation and PARP degradation were also noted all the
   cell lines, but these changes were not statistically significant among
   the 3 cell lines. Taken together, these results indicate that As2O3 is
   an excellent candidate as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of
   neuroblastoma.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1458-1462}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: The potential weakness of the open Bankart procedure is the
   takedown and repair of the subscapularis tendon. It is not known to what
   extent this part of the procedure affects the final result.
   Hypothesis: The function of the subscapularis muscle after surgery will
   be related to the patient's perception of surgical success.
   Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.
   Methods: A total of 30 patients with traumatic anterior instability had
   an open Bankart repair by a single surgeon. These patients were observed
   for a mean of 4 years. At final follow-up, the patients filled out 3
   self-assessment forms: the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scale,
   the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index, and the Constant and
   Murley scale. An independent physician performed a complete physical
   examination. Strength testing of all muscle groups was performed and
   compared with the opposite normal side.
   Results: Multiple factors were related to the patient's perception of
   the result. Only subscapularis function was found to have a
   statistically significant correlation. Of the patients, 23\% had an
   incompetent subscapularis with a mean of 27\% strength as compared with
   the opposite side. These patients had a positive lift-off test result
   and reported 57\% good and excellent results; only 57\% would have the
   surgery again. Of the patients, 77\% had a normal functioning
   subscapularis with at least 80\% strength as compared with the opposite
   side. These patients had a negative lift-off test result and had 91\%
   good and excellent results; 100\% would have the surgery again. The
   Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index was the only scale that
   differentiated between a patient with subscapularis function and a
   patient without subscapularis function.
   Conclusion: Postoperative subscapularis function was the most critical
   factor in determining the patient's perception of surgical success.
   Clinical Relevance: It is likely that handling of the subscapularis
   tendon during surgery and protection of the subscapularis in the first
   weeks after surgery are critical to the success of the open Bankart
   repair.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the effect of early syphilis on blood and semen
   plasma HIV-1 viral loads and CD4 counts.
   Methods: In a retrospective case-control study, blood plasma HIV-1 viral
   loads and CD4 counts in cases during early syphilis ( n = 63, 27
   receiving antiretroviral therapy) were compared to those before and
   after syphilis and with controls with non-systemic acute sexually
   transmitted infections (STI) ( n = 104, 39 receiving antiretroviral
   therapy). In a prospective substudy in those not receiving
   antiretroviral therapy, semen plasma viral loads during early syphilis (
   n = 13) were compared with those 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after
   treatment for syphilis and with controls with no STIs ( n = 20).
   Results: Retrospective study: CD4 counts were similar in cases ( median
   410, n = 139 counts) during early syphilis compared to before ( 485, n =
   80) and after ( 475, n = 88). In a secondary analysis, a drop in CD4
   count (21\%) among those with early latent syphilis was observed
   compared with controls. Blood plasma viral loads did not change
   significantly overall or in those with primary, secondary, or early
   latent syphilis. Effects were similar on or off antiretroviral therapy.
   Prospective study: blood and semen viral loads were slightly higher in
   cases compared with controls but treatment of early syphilis did not
   reduce either.
   Conclusions: We detected no association between early syphilis and
   changes in blood or semen viral load or CD4 count. Increased HIV-1
   infectivity associated with early syphilis is unlikely to be associated
   with increased levels of HIV-1 RNA in blood or semen.}},

Abstract = {{The phases and magnetic properties of Co-Zr-C melt-spun ribbon were
   studied. The Co80Zr20 melt-spun ribbon consisted of a metastable Co-5 Zr
   phase together with fcc-Co and Co-23 Zr-6 phases and showed a high
   coercivity. The small substitution of C for Zr in the Co-Zr melt-spun
   ribbon resulted in the increase in the saturation magnetization.
   However, the substitution resulted in the decrease in the coercivity.
   Unlike the Co-Zr melt-spun ribbon, annealing of the Co-Zr-C melt-spun
   ribbon resulted in the further decrease in the coercivity.
   Thermomagnetic studies showed that the Co-Zr-C melt-spun ribbon
   consisted of the new magnetic phase with a high Curie temperature and a
   high-saturation magnetization. X-ray diffraaction studies of the Co-Zr-C

Abstract = {{We study the performance of joint signature-receiver optimization for
   direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) with limited
   feedback. The receiver for a particular user selects the signature from
   a signature codebook, and relays the corresponding B index bits to the
   transmitter over a noiseless channel. We study the performance of a
   random vector quantization (RVQ) scheme in which the codebook entries
   are independent and isotropically distributed. Assuming the interfering
   signatures are independent, and have independent and identically
   distributed (i.i.d.) elements, we evaluate the received
   signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) in the large system limit
   as the number of users, processing gain, and feedback bits B all tend to
   infinity with fixed ratios. This SINR is evaluated for both the matched
   filter and linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receivers.
   Furthermore, we show that this large system SINR is the maximum that can
   be achieved over any sequence of codebooks. Numerical results show that
   with the MMSE receiver, one feedback bit per signature coefficient
   achieves close to single-user performance. We also consider a less
   complex and suboptimal reduced-rank signature optimization scheme in
   which the user's signature is constrained to lie in a lower dimensional
   subspace. The optimal subspace coefficients are scalar-quantized and
   relayed to the transmitter. The large system performance of the
   quantized reduced-rank scheme can be approximated, and numerical results
   show that it performs in the vicinity of the RVQ bound. Finally, we
   extend our analysis to the scenario in which a subset of users optimize
   their signatures in the presence of random interference.}},

Abstract = {{The pseudoelastic behavior of an Fe-28Mn-6Si-5Cr-0.53Nb-0.06C (mass\%)
   alloy with respect to the thermomechanical treatment of pre-warm-rolling
   and subsequent ageing is investigated. A partial pseudoelasticity
   appears between A(s) and M-d, where A, is the reverse martensitic
   transformation start temperature and Md is the temperature above which
   the martensitic transformation cannot be induced by stress. It can be
   reasonably interpreted as transformation pseudoelasticity, like for
   thermoelastic shape memory alloys such as Ti-Ni-based alloys and
   Cu-based alloys. The thermomechanical treatment is effective in
   enhancing the pseudoelasticity by increasing the M-d temperature. It is
   also found that the alloy exhibits a partial pseudoelasticity below A(s)
   when the sample is deformed into a two-phase state: fcc and hcp. A
   conceivable reason for the driving force of the reverse transformation
   (from hcp to fcc) on unloading is the back-stress experienced by
   Shockley partial dislocations residing at the tip of the martensite
   plates, which originates from NbC precipitates. Perfect pseudoelasticity
   is also obtained when the specimen is subjected to cyclic loading.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Associations between the APOE genotype and various medical
   conditions have been documented at a very young age. The association
   between the APOE genotype and cognitive performance varies at different
   ages. APOE related changes in brain activation have been recently
   reported for middle aged and elderly subjects.
   Objective: To explore APOE related alterations during cognitive
   activation in a population of young adults.
   Methods: Using (H2O)-O-15 positron emission tomography ( PET), imaging
   was carried out in 20 healthy young adults ( age 19 to 28 years; four
   epsilon 4 carriers and 16 non-epsilon 4 carriers) during a non-verbal
   memory task. Voxel-wise multiple regression analyses were undertaken,
   with the activation difference PET counts as the dependent variable and
   the APOE genotype as the independent variable.
   Results: Brain regions were identified where e4 carriers showed
   significantly lower or higher activation than non-carriers.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that APOE dependent modulation of
   cerebral flow may be present even at a young age. This may reflect an
   APOE related physiological heterogeneity which may or may not predispose
   to brain disease in the ensuing decades or, less likely, the effect of
   very early Alzheimer's disease related pathological changes.}},

Abstract = {{Different principal types of plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition
   (PECVD) processes of silicon oxides are used: the conventional RF (13.56
   MHz) PECVD, remote PECVD, inductive coupled high density plasma CVD and
   very high frequency (VHF) PECVD. Single-water chambers with
   parallel-plate PECVD systems are expected to be the mainstream for the
   future for PECVD processes. Equipment and process improvements include
   activities to improve wafer throughput and film uniformity and to
   eliminate plasma damage to layers and devices.
   Increasing the excitation frequency from the commonly used 13.56 MHz up
   to the lower VHF range (40-80 MHz) has demonstrated higher deposition
   rates with good electronic film properties. A single-wafer
   parallel-plate PECVD system was developed using a 40.68 MHz excitation.
   The wafer temperature is controlled by a helium back side flush avoiding
   also a deposition at the wafer back side.
   A stable plasma confined between the electrodes away from the walls of
   the chamber, an optimised plasma density to get a sufficient deposition
   rate and good film uniformity, and a controlled wafer temperature which
   influences the plasma-surface interaction were achieved. Using a
   SiH4/N2O process and a deposition rate of 1 nm/s a high breakdown
   voltage >= 6 MV/cm and a refractive index of 1.46 +/- 0.015 were
   obtained. Film thickness uniformity was < 5\%. A SF6/O-2 process is used
   for the reactor cleaning with etching rates of about I nm/s. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The Annonaceae are a pantropical angiosperm. family, in which Anaxagorea
   is sister to the rest of the family based on previous phylogenetic
   studies. Anaxagorea is the only genus of Annonaceae with a disjunct
   distribution in South and Central America and southeast Asia. Earlier
   arguments on the biogeographic history of Annonaceae led to the
   hypothesis of a Laurasian origin for Anaxagorea. A detailed phylogenetic
   study was conducted using 75 morphological characters and molecular
   sequences from the atpB-rbcL, psbA-trnH, and trnL-trnF spacer regions
   and the trnL intron. Molecular analyses alone do not support the
   monophyly of the Asian species, but the morphological and combined
   molecular and morphological analyses do. AN analyses place most Central
   American species in a clade, but none support an Asian-Central American
   clade. South American species form a basal grade, thereby refuting the
   hypothesis of a Laurasian origin for the genus and indicating instead a
   Gondwanan origin. Parsimony optimizations and DIVA reconstructions of
   biogeographic data indicate separate dispersals from South America to
   Central America and to Asia. Molecular age estimates indicate an Eocene
   origin for the genus. The clade containing the Asian and Central
   American species is dated to be younger than the Oligocene climatic
   deterioration, which reduces support for the North Atlantic land bridge
   as a dispersal route from South America to Asia.}},

Abstract = {{Migrants living in Germany are a both large and vulnerable population
   subgroup. They are not easily induced to participate in health surveys,
   Hence, achieving high participation rates of migrants in health surveys
   and avoiding selection bias is a difficult task. In this study, we
   report (in the participation of migrants in the German National Health
   Telephone Survey 2003 (GSTe103), the first comprehensive national health
   survey conducted by telephone in Germany. Three migrant groups were
   identified: individuals with non-German citizenship (foreigners),
   naturalized migrants, and ethnic German immigrants (Spataussiedler). The
   aim of this study is to evaluate the degree to which the GSTe103
   subsample of foreigners is representative for foreigners living in
   Germany. We compare the prevalence of sociodemographic characteristics
   and selected health indicators of foreigners in the GNTe103 subsample
   with prevalences from national statistics and from a large national
   household survey ({''}Mikrozensus 2003{''}). The proportion of
   participants with non-German nationality in the overall GSTe103 sample
   was significantly lower than the proportion of foreigners in the
   residential population in Germany (3.7 \% vs. 8.9 \%). While there was
   no evidence of selection bias with regard to age and sex distribution,
   we found significant differences with regard to other factors, including
   nationality, length of stay in Germany, unemployment rate and education.
   The comparison of health indicators showed only moderate differences
   between GSTe103 sample and ``Mikrozensus{''} results. However, these
   differences did not consistently point to a better or worse health
   status in the GSTe103 sample of foreigners and should therefore not be
   generalised in respect of other health indicators. Our study emphasises
   the importance of a continuous effort to improve migrant participation
   in health studies and of a thorough analysis of selection bias when
   interpreting results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the computer-aided generation of reduced-order
   macromodels (ROMs) for system level simulation using VHDL-AMS. The focus
   is thereby set on the application of ROMs in system simulation. It also
   gives an survey of our approach of reduced-order modeling. VHDL-AMS is
   used to describe microelectromechanical systems based on lumped and
   rigid bodies for several years. But such models often have a limited
   accuracy if the system contains flexible bodies or nonhomogeneous
   electrical fields. Methods of reduced-order modeling of linear systems
   to increase the system model accuracy are also available for some years.
   The work presented in this paper combines the advantages of
   reduced-order modeling and VHDL-AMS system level simulation, whereas our
   approch of reduced-order modeling is able to handle nonlinear systems
   too. The application of ROMs on system level and their export to
   VHDL-AMS have been demonstrated by two surface micromachined vibration
   sensor arrays which are intended for wear state recognition.
   Additionally, a new approach called ``multi architecture modeling{''}
   has been applied which simplifies the integration of macromodels into
   the system. As a result of this work, we are able to simulate certain
   classes of nonlinear ROMs with an error less than 1\% compared with the
   finite-element method simulation. Also, simulation time of ROMs is
   shorter than simulation time of models based on lumped and rigid bodies.}},

   the reelin signaling pathway, can complex with the cytoplasmic region of
   beta 1 integrin in a reelin-dependent manner. Thus, alpha 3 beta 1

Abstract = {{Objectives: At present, most promising compounds to treat
   enterovirus-induced diseases are broad-spectrum capsid function
   inhibitors which bind into a hydrophobic pocket in viral capsid protein
   1 (VP1). Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) Nancy was the only prototypic
   enterovirus strain shown to be pleconaril-resistant. This study was
   designed to better understand the polymorphism of the hydrophobic pocket
   in CVB3 laboratory strains and clinical isolates and its implications
   for treatment with the capsid function inhibitor pleconaril.
   Methods: Pleconaril susceptibility was determined in cytopathic
   effect-inhibitory, plaque reduction or virus yield assays. Sequence
   analysis of the genome region coding for VP1 and/or subsequent alignment
   of amino acids lining the hydrophobic pocket of five CVB3 laboratory
   strains and 20 clinical isolates were carried out. Virus chimeras and
   computational analysis were used to prove the role of amino acid 1092.
   Results and conclusions: Despite high conservation of pocket amino
   acids, polymorphism was detected at positions 1092, 1094 and 1180.
   Neither Pro-1094 -> Thr nor Val-1180 -> Ile altered efficacy of
   pleconaril treatment. But the amino acid at position 1092 was strongly
   associated with susceptibility of CVB3 to the capsid inhibitor. Whereas
   leucine was involved in resistance, isoleucine and valine were detected
   in pleconaril-susceptible CVB3. Results from antiviral assays with
   hybrid viruses demonstrate the crucial role of amino acid 1092 in
   pleconaril susceptibility. A resistant cDNA-generated CVB3 became
   pleconaril-susceptible after accepting parts from the genome region
   encoding Ile-1092 into its capsid. Computational analysis suggests that
   conformational changes in the hydrophobic pocket occur when leucine is
   substituted for isoleucine or valine and that this change leads to
   susceptibility to pleconaril.}},

   significant positive correlations of IQ scores with FA were found
   bilaterally in white matter association areas, including frontal and
   occipito-parietal areas. No regions were found exhibiting correlations
   of IQ with MD except for one frontal area significantly overlapping a
   region containing a significant correlation with FA. The positive
   direction of the correlation with FA is the same as that found
   previously with age, and indicates a positive relationship between fiber
   organization and/or density with cognitive function. The results are
   consistent with the hypothesis that regionally specific increased fiber

Journal = {{MEDICAL EDUCATION}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION In Flanders an important part of training to become a
   general practitioner (GP) is undertaken within a general practice. This
   requires a GP trainer to know how to facilitate learning processes. This
   paper reports a study focused on the research question: Does short but
   individualised training of GP trainers contribute to their teaching
   competence?
   METHOD A total of 47 GP trainers were randomly divided into 2 groups of
   a pretest/post-test control group design. After a multiple-station
   teaching assessment test (MSTAT), the experimental group received a
   short but individualised training to improve teaching competence while
   the control group were given no specific programme regarding teaching
   competence. One year later, all participants were invited to sit the
   post-test.
   RESULTS In all, 61 GP trainers participated in the pretest and 51 in the
   post-test; 44 GP trainers participated in both tests. Despite the large
   attrition, the internal validity of the experiment was preserved.
   Beginners gained a median score of 2.04 (on a scale of 0-5) on the first
   MSTAT. In the post-test, the experimental group (median = 3.12) scored
   significantly better on the entire test (Mann-Whitney U = 166.5, P <
   0.05) compared with the control group (median = 2.84). However, the GP
   trainers in the control group also appeared to have made progress.
   CONCLUSION General practitioners who start as GP trainers have
   insufficient teaching competence to guarantee good coaching of students.
   A personal programme leads to progress in teaching competence; however,
   it would seem that more time and support are necessary to allow GP
   trainers to gain full teaching competence. The fact that the control
   group made progress as well suggests that the test had an important
   learning effect.}},

Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Little is known about the effects of steroids on cortical
   bone. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of
   glucocorticoid treatment on cortical bone density, strength, and
   formation of new bone in ovariectomized sheep and to compare it to
   cancellous bone.
   Materials and methods: Sixteen ovariectornized merino sheep either
   received a 6-month glucocorticoid treatment (GLU; 0.45 mg/kg/day
   Methylprednisolone s.c.) or were left untreated (control). After 2 and 4
   months, newly formed bone was labeled by the administration calceingreen
   and Tetracycline-hydrochloride. After 12 months, the animals were
   sacrificed and cortical specimens were obtained from the tibial
   diaphysis. Cancellous bone specimens were harvested from the proximal
   tibia. All specimens were scanned for apparent BMD by pQCT and tested
   mechanically. Formation of new bone was analyzed using histological
   slices of the femoral condyles and cross-sections the mid-diaphysis of
   the tibia.
   Results: The intracortical formation of new bone in
   glucocorticoid-treated sheep was 70\% lower after 2 months and 80\%
   lower after 4 months. Six months after the termination of the steroid
   administration, the active bone area was 20\% lower than in the control
   group. Cortical width and cortical bone area were reduced by 7-8\% and
   marrow area increased by 8\% in steroid-treated animals compared to
   control animals. Neither cortical apparent bone mineral density nor
   biomechanical parameters of cortical bone specimens differed between the
   groups. Cancellous bone formation in steroid-treated animals declined by
   68\% after 2 months and by 90\% after 4 months. After 1 year, cancellous
   bone formation was reduced by 38\% compared to control. The apparent
   cancellous bone mineral density and cancellous bone compressive
   stiffness were reduced by 34\% and 55\%, respectively.
   Conclusion: A six-month glucocorticoid treatment of ovariectomized sheep
   resulted in a substantial reduction of bone forination both in cortical
   and in cancellous bone and reduced cortical width by increased endosteal
   resorption. Beyond changes in cancellous bone, impaired cortical bone
   remodeling may add to the increased fracture risk at the hip or the
   distal radius in patients treated with steroids. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   Method. - Using available data we report on the spectrum of mental
   health care services provided in Berlin, the number of professionals
   working in these sectors, funding arrangements, pathways into care, and
   user/carer involvement.
   Results. - The health care system in Berlin consists of a network of
   inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and rehabilitative facilities, all of
   which are meant to work in a synergistic fashion. However, although the
   individual treatment options are generally well-planned, there is still
   a lack of co-ordination between them. Currently, the entire network is
   threatened by cuts in state funding for ancillary and rehabilitative
   services, by further reductions in the number of hospital beds, and by
   insurance company cuts in prescription drug budgets, such as those used
   for atypical antipsychotics in outpatient care.
   Discussion. - Despite many similarities with the situation in other
   European capitals, the system of mental health care in Berlin suffers
   from a variety of problems related to co-ordination and costs that are

Abstract = {{Purpose: Multislice CT (MSCT) has the advantage of isotropic volumetric
   data acquisition which allows high resolution data reconstruction in the
   axial and coronal plane. We evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of
   coronal reconstruction compared to axial reconstructions of a routinely
   performed CT scan exemplary in neck lymph node assessment performed on a
   16 row MSCT.
   Material and Methods: Contrast enhanced neck MSCT of 24 patients with
   known lymphoma were evaluated prospectively for lymph node assessment. 4
   blinded readers evaluated the axial and coronal reconstructions of the
   same patient. Neck lymph nodes larger than 10 mm were evaluated by their
   anatomical region (deep jugular chain, submandibular, nuchal). Time for
   axial and coronal image evaluation was assessed. Detection rate was
   compared with consensus reading as gold standard.
   Results: In consensus reading 169 enlarged lymph nodes in the deep
   jugular chain were found. Detection rate for axial image interpretation
   was 36.1\% with 54.9\% in coronal reading. Assessing the submandibular
   lymph nodes (n = 45) axial interpretation revealed 53.9\% with 36.1\% in
   coronal reading. Evaluation time for axial reading was in all but one
   reader significantly longer (mean 176 seconds) than in coronal reading
   (mean 129 seconds).
   Conclusion: Coronal image reading improves the detection rate of
   cranio-caudal oriented structures. Considering representatively neck
   lymph nodes in the deep jugular chain the image interpretation time is
   significantly reduced. Still axial reading remains necessary for
   assessing axially oriented structures such as the submandibular region
   in the neck.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of delivering triptorelin ({[}D-Trp(6)]LHRH) by
   transdermal iontophoresis was evaluated in vitro. Peptide
   electrotransport at different current densities and donor concentrations
   was measured across porcine ear skin. The concomitant delivery of an
   electroosmotic marker enabled calculation of the respective
   contributions of electromigration (EM) and electroosmosis (EO) to
   iontophoretic delivery. At a given concentration (3 mM), a threefold
   increase in current density produced a corresponding increase in the
   cumulative amount of peptide present in the receptor compartment.
   Conversely, doubling the concentration to 6 mM produced a twofold
   reduction in the amount of peptide delivered, partly due to a
   concentration-dependent inhibition of EO. EM was revealed to be the
   predominant transport mechanism, accounting for 80\% of overall
   delivery. Finally, despite the inhibition of EO, the results indicate
   that application of an iontophoretic current of 0.8 mA over a relatively
   small contact area (4 cm(2)) would provide a delivery rate of 36 mu g/h,
   largely sufficient for therapeutic requirements. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether preoperative disc space height (DSH)
   influences the clinical outcomes of patients diagnosed with single-level
   symptomatic discogenic disease and treated with a stand-alone anterior
   lumbar interbody fusion with two tapered threaded fusion cages, we
   performed a retrospective analysis of 392 patients.
   Methods: Preoperative radiographs were used to establish four study
   groups based on the patients' DSH: the tall disc group: DSH > 15 mm; the
   intermediate tall group: DSH ranging from 10 to 15 mm; the intermediate
   collapsed group: DSH ranging from 5 to 10 mm; and the collapsed disc
   group: DSH < 5 mm.
   Results: All of the patient groups exhibited improvement in their
   clinical outcomes. However, patients in the collapsed disc group (DSH of
   < 5 mm) tended to have earlier and greater improvement in Oswestry
   Disability Index scores, Physical Component Summary scores of the Short
   Form-36, and Visual Analog Scale scores for low back pain.
   Conclusion: Symptomatic disc degeneration can be readily identified with
   plain radiographic findings, and patients' symptoms can often be
   relieved predictably with a stand-alone interbody fusion procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To assess the long-term success of treatment with repeated
   botulinum-A toxin (BTX-A; Botox) injections into the detrusor muscle for
   neurogenic detrusor overactivity in children.
   Methods. We reviewed the charts of 10 children (average age at first
   injection 11.2 years) with neurogenic detrusor overactivity who had
   received at least three BTX-A detrusor injections; four had received
   five or more injections. The total dose of BTX-A was 85 to 300 U. We
   measured the urodynamic outcomes 6 months after each injection and
   compared the results after the first injection with the results after
   the third and fifth injections (in the children who had five or more
   injections).
   Results. The relative changes-each in comparison with the value before
   injection therapy-after the first versus the fifth injection were as
   follows: the reflex volume increased by 81\% versus 88\%, maximal
   detrusor pressure decreased by 7\% versus 39\%, maximal cystometric
   bladder capacity increased by 88\% versus 72\%, and bladder compliance
   showed no change at the 6-month follow-up visit after the first
   injection and an increase of 109\% after the fifth injection. The
   results after the third injection were generally similar to those after
   the fifth injection. No major side effects occurred.
   Conclusions. Although we surveyed only a few patients, the efficacy
   seems clear in all the urodynamic measures after repeated BTX-A detrusor
   injections in children with neurogenic bladder. Also, we found no
   evidence of drug tolerance. Thus, BTX-A detrusor injection has gained
   additional importance in the treatment of these difficult-to-treat
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines temporal differences in cigarette smoking initiation
   and cessation among male and female birth cohorts of 1926-1970 born in
   Germany. Based on the German Federal Health Survey 1998 the sample is
   divided into a series of 5-year sex-birth cohorts, beginning with those
   born between 1926 and 1930 and extending to those born between 1966 and
   1970. The final data file consists of a sample of 5110 people.
   Ever-smoking prevalence among men varies from 60 to 70\% between the
   birth cohorts, while in women born 1926-1930 ever-smoking increases from
   20 to about 50\% in those born 1966-1970. A reduction of the median age
   at starting smoking also takes place between the cohorts. With 8.5 years
   this decrease is more incisive among women, compared with a drop of 2
   years among men. Regarding cessation patterns the analysis shows a Shift
   towards a shorter duration of smoking with succeeding birth cohorts,
   again this shift is More incisive in women. But even in the youngest
   cohort still more than 50\% of ever-smokers smoke regularly for more
   than 25 years. In Germany tobacco-control activities are required in
   order to take antismoking actions that especially prevent youth from
   starting to smoke and that support smokers in quitting.}},

   digital phalanges, metacarpal and metatarsal bones. The periosteal new
   bone was characterized by the formation of coralliform osteophytes,
   typically seen in cases of hypertrophic osteopathy. As usual in animals

Abstract = {{The present study was performed to determine what proportion of people
   in Sardinia with or without Crohn's disease were infected with
   Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis and had a preponderance
   of allelic variants of Nod2, an intracellular protein involved in
   Crohn's disease susceptibility. Genetic analysis of the alleles of the
   NOD2/CARD15 gene (insC3020, G908R, and R702W alleles), linked to
   susceptibility or genetic predisposition to Crohn's disease in humans,
   was carried out on specimens from 37 Crohn's disease patients and 34
   patients without Crohn's disease. Our results show that more than 70
   percent of people in Sardinia with Crohn's disease carry at least one of
   the susceptibility-associated NOD2/CARD15 alleles and were infected with
   Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis.}},

Abstract = {{Weathering and internal dissolution processes in mining waste materials
   may mobilize elevated levels of arsenic (As), contaminating ground and
   surface waters. Treating the polluted waters with iron oxyhydroxides is
   an established remediation method. By contrast, little knowledge is
   available to stabilize As in source materials by treating it with Fe
   precipitates and, on this way, to prevent the generation of polluted
   waters. In the present work the efficiency of Fe(II) treatment on As
   immobilization in a tailings material (TM) was studied with regard to
   the Fe:As molar ratio, the influence of CaCO3 amendment, and the As
   desorption at continued intensive leaching of Fe-treated TM. Fe
   precipitates were created by aerobic treatment of TM with Fe(II)sulfate
   at several Fe:As molar ratios with or without adding CaCO3, followed by
   aging the Fe-treated TM. The As retention in the treated tailings was
   studied by 4-fold elution with water, and the As desorption kinetics was
   examined by suspension leaching in laboratory microcosms over 3 weeks.
   Fe(II) treatment of TM reduced the water-extractable total As to < 10 mu
   g/L as the Fe:As molar ratio increased from 0 to 8. The water-soluble As
   of Fe-treated tailings could be reduced to 10-30 mu g/L also under
   conditions of intensive leaching. Stabilizing the pH with CaCO3 resulted
   in consistently higher As release. The As desorption data followed the
   first-order kinetics in the early time stages of the desorption whereas
   at longer times the parabolic diffusion model was valid. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The concept of personalized ventilation (PV) is at the cutting edge of
   technological development in the area of air conditioning and is
   fundamentally aimed at improving ventilation in the immediate breathing
   zones of occupants in the built environment. While the current
   state-of-the-art PV systems make this possible for seated individuals
   within the occupied zone, it is envisaged that flexible PV systems,
   extending the range of application within the dynamic movements of
   individuals in an air-conditioned zone, may be a reality in the near
   future. The ability of P V systems to enhance thermal comfort and indoor
   air quality (IAQ) and the energy savings that would result were examined
   under the hot and humid tropical conditions of Singapore. The
   experimental design consisted of 17 different environmental conditions,
   characterized by a combination of room ambient temperature (23 degrees C
   and 26 degrees C), PV air temperature (20 degrees C, 23 degrees C, and
   26 degrees C), and the PV airflow rate (7, 11, and 15 L/s per person).
   The experimental design also included a reference condition with the
   primary background air-conditioning system operating under the same
   conditions but without PV air. Eleven human subjects took part in all
   the experiments, and a detailed questionnaire was employed to solicit
   their subjective responses during each exposure. Air velocity, air
   temperature, and ventilation effectiveness were measured in the
   immediate breathing zone of each occupant. The results indicate that the
   use of a secondary PV system in conjunction with a primary
   air-conditioning system not only enhances thermal comfort and IAQ
   acceptability but can reduce energy consumption by 15-30\%. PV systems
   can improve ventilation effectiveness at the immediate breathing zone by
   up to 50\% more than can be obtained with mixing ventilation (MV) alone,
   and P V tends to lower the average temperature of inhaled air in the
   breathing zone by 2-5 degrees C, enhancing perceived air quality. PV
   temperature and PV flow rate were found to be more critical than ambient
   temperature for occupants' thermal comfort and the perceived air quality
   of inhaled air.}},

Abstract = {{Current Western medical treatment lays its main emphasis on
   evidence-based medicine (EBM) and cure is assessed by quantifying the
   effects of treatment statistically.
   In contrast, in Chinese medicine, cure is generally assessed by
   evaluating the patient's ``pattern{''} (Zheng) {[}ef. Glossary] and
   medicines are prescribed according to this. We believe that traditional
   Chinese medicine (TCM) cannot he evaluated precisely according to
   Western principles, in which a constant amount of the same medicine is
   given to a group of patients to he evaluated, When assessing cure using
   TCM, Zheng is more important than the determination of medical effects.
   This means that quantitative evaluation of TCM treatment can be very
   difficult.
   In this paper, we focused on the Yin-Yang {[}cf. Glossary] balance to
   determine Zheng and at the same tithe attempted to determine the
   treatment effects by applying the concept (if regulation of Yin-Yang
   according to chronotherapeutic principles.
   According to Zheng, advanced cancer patients generally lack both Yin and
   Yang. Chinese medical treatment therefore seeks to supplement both Yin
   and Yang. However, we divided patients into two groups and compared them
   with respect to survival, One group was administered a predominantly
   Yang (Qi) {[}cf. Glossary] ionic herbal treatment during the daytime,
   while the other group was administered Yin (Blood) {[}cf. Glossary]
   tonics during night time.
   A comparison of the results of treatment showed that the patients in the
   group receiving Yang (Qi) replenishment during the daytime lived longer
   than patients receiving Yin (Blood) nourishment during the night.
   Moreover, the patients in the daytime Yang (Qi) replenishment group also
   fared significantly better than patients treated solely by Western
   methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new compensation pattern method to eliminate the footing effect on
   MEMS devices was proposed using the buffer structure in silicon deep RIE
   (reactive ion etching). The buffer structure gets the entire footing
   effect instead of the desired structure and then it is removed after the
   deep RIE process. The compensation pattern was devised from the
   characteristics of the RIE lag and the footing effect. The silicon
   inside the buffer structure is etched to the sacrificial layer and the
   footing effect first occurs at that moment. The desired structure is not
   etched to the bottom layer at that moment because of the RIE lag. The
   etch process is terminated when the desired structure is patterned. The
   proposed method makes it possible to remove the footing effect in the
   deep RIE process by modifying the mask layout without changing the
   fabrication processes. The sense capacitances were approximately 1.7
   times higher than that of conventional devices, which verified the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{The Paris and Prague Zemgor committees were created almost
   simultaneously in February and March 1921. From the start, their
   relations took a particular turn owing mostly to their leaders'
   divergent political tendencies and backgrounds. The Prague committee was
   entirely state-financed until its liquidation in 1934. The financial
   independence this conferred to it had significant repercussions on its
   relations with the Paris committee. The stumbling block was the
   definition of each committee's purview. There were numerous causes for
   lack of mutual understanding, to wit the reactions of the leaders of the
   Paris Zemgor committee to the series of scandals inside the Russian
   community involving the Prague committee. However, the relationship of
   conflict between the two committees did not mean that they failed to
   cooperate. They did find common ground, be it the settlement of the
   Czech debt to Zemgor (the so-called ``automobile affair{''}), the
   professional placement of refugees, or their joint effort within the
   League of Nations' bodies in the elaboration of a legal status for
   Russian refugees. The existence of these areas of agreement was
   facilitated by the personal ties uniting some of the Paris and Prague
   leaders.}},

Abstract = {{For the purpose of protecting electric power system, many researches and
   developments of fault current limiters are being performed. The authors
   studied a dc hybrid three-phase fault current limiting interrupter
   (FCLI) composed of a superconducting reactor and an S/N transition
   element, connected in series each other. The dc hybrid type fault
   current limiting interrupter can limit a fault current by means of the
   inductance of high temperature superconducting (HTS) coil together with
   the normal transition of HTS bulk material (HTSB). In the case of an
   accident, the normal transition of the bulk material can be accelerated
   by the magnetic field of the HTS coil. In this paper, the dc hybrid type
   fault current limiting interrupter for 5.5 km long 6.6 kV-600 A power
   distribution system is analyzed, and performances of fault current
   limitation and interruption are confirmed. Moreover, a reclosing
   operation is discussed for this power distribution system. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Millimeter-wave (MMW) communication systems, specially from 60 GHz band,
   are expected to play a key role in realizing the intelligent
   transportation system (ITS) for high date rate and multimedia
   communications. During the last years, System-in-package (SiP) solutions
   for MMW RF-transceiver have become an attractive alternative to
   System-on-Chip (SoC) approaches. In the scheme, active circuits are
   integrated with passive circuit much tightly. Traditional distributed
   hybrid circuit concept, such as ADS and Microwave Office, is not quite
   applicable for SiP, specially in MMW frequency. In this paper, an
   improved finite-difference time-domain formulation using the matrix
   theory and an improved integral transform is presented to solve hybrid
   high-order linear lumped circuit and passive circuit problem implicitly
   instead of explicit method used for traditional FDTD method. In this
   improved method, general high-order linear lumped circuit is expressed
   firstly as not only one equation but also equations set according
   kirchhoff's laws. Then, a local iterative matrix expression connecting
   with each active circuit can be built when EM fields, current/current
   density and interior variable of equations set are treated as separated
   vector element. In order to make this formulation stable, an improved
   integral transform is proposed to reform the matrix's condition number.
   Simulations show that the results by our improved FDTD formulation can
   effectively not only keep the accuracy of passive circuit, but also
   integrate high-order linear lumped circuit expressed by equations set as
   well as one equation.}},

Abstract = {{A source driven magnetized oblique presheath is analyzed by means of a
   kinetic model and a detailed kinetic simulation using a
   backward-Lagrangian characteristics based simulation procedure. The
   four-dimensional ion phase-space distribution function and its
   associated moments, namely, density, flow velocity, and parallel and
   perpendicular temperatures are simulated. Extra simplification in the
   moment derivation results from the simulation procedure which
   facilitates the use of a structured distribution of nodes in the
   three-dimensional velocity space. Strong kinetic effects appear in the
   oblique geometry as the two temperatures are observed to drop
   preferentially in the limits of normal and grazing incidences. The
   effects are reflected also in the detailed behavior of flow velocity
   profiles which show a finite dependence on the angle of magnetic field's
   incidence in the region of magnetized presheath. A comparison of the
   kinetic solutions with those obtained from the existing fluid models is

   PM10. Three sampling locations, Indian Institute of Technology (I IT)
   (control site), Vikas Nagar (VN) (commercial site) and Juhi Colony (JC)
   (residential site) were selected. Total forty-seven 24-h samples were
   collected for PM2.5 and PM10 during October 2002-February 2003 at these
   locations. The collected PM10 samples were subjected to chemical
   analysis for determination of heavy metals and toxic organic fraction by
   measuring BSOF. PM10 (45-589 mu g m(-3)), PM2.5 (25-200 mu g m(-3)),
   BSOF (1-170 mu g m(-3)) and heavy metals were highest at VN followed by
   JC and IIT. The study concluded that the overall air quality in the city
   of Kanpur was much inferior to other cities in India and abroad. Similar
   to PM10 and PM2.5, heavy metals were almost 5-10 times higher than
   levels in European cities. The study concluded that there was a need to
   address the issue of PM2.5 monitoring and control. Because regular PM2.5
   monitoring may take some time, a linear model for predicting PM2.5 using
   routinely monitored parameters PM10 and BSOF was suggested for
   preliminary assessment. The model was checked for its adequacy and it
   was validated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate a simple class of type-II string compactifications which
   incorporate nongeometric ``fluxes{''} in addition to ``geometric
   flux{''} and the usual H-field and R-R fluxes. These compactifications
   are nongeometric analogues of the twisted torus. We develop T-duality
   rules for NS-NS geometric and nongeometric fluxes, which we use to
   construct a superpotential for the dimensionally reduced
   four-dimensional theory. The resulting structure is invariant under
   T-duality, so that the distribution of vacua in the IIA and IIB theories
   is identical when nongeometric fluxes are included. This gives a
   concrete framework in which to investigate the possibility that generic
   string compactifications may be nongeometric in any duality frame. The
   framework developed in this paper also provides some concrete hints for
   how mirror symmetry can be generalized to compactifications with
   arbitrary H-flux, whose mirrors are generically nongeometric.}},

Abstract = {{In Ba(1 - x)SrxZr(BO3)(2): Tb3+, the VUV excitation spectrum consists of
   one broad band at 120 - 170 nm and some bands ranging from 160 - 300 nm.

   latter bands are due to the transitions of Tb3+ (4f(8)-> 4f(5)d). The
   host absorption band moves about 30 nm to the high energy region with x
   increasing. As the Ce3+, is doped in the samples, the absorption band
   evidently decreases in VUV region. The emission spectrum reveals an

Abstract = {{The effects of dietary alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA) on the pH value,
   AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, and the activities of
   glycogen phosphorylase and pyruvate kinase in postmortem muscle were
   investigated. Eighteen C57BL/6J mice were fed diets containing 0\%,
   0.5\%, and 1.0\% alpha-LA. At the end of 2-week feeding trial, the mice
   were killed and longissimus muscles were sampled at 0-, 1-, and 24-h
   postmortem for pH determination and enzyme assay. The results showed
   that dietary alpha-LA treatment significantly slowed down the decrease
   of pH values in postmortem muscle. The ultimate pH values in postmortem
   muscle of mice receiving 0.5\% and 1.0\% alpha-LA treatments were 6.40
   and 6.63, respectively, significantly higher than that (6.2 1) of no
   alpha-LA treatment (p < 0.05). AMPK was activated at the early
   postmortem stage. Dietary alpha-LA can suppress the activation of AMPK
   in postmortem muscle. At 1- and 24-h postmortem, activities of AMPK were
   much lower in postmortem muscle of mice receiving 0.5\% and 1.0\%
   alpha-LA treatments than that with no alpha-LA treatment. Between these
   two dietary alpha-LA treatments, however, no difference in AMPK activity
   was observed, indicating that 0.5\% dietary alpha-LA is enough to
   suppress AMPK in postmortem muscle. Similar to AMPK, glycogen
   phosphorylase activity was higher in the treatment without dietary
   alpha-LA than those with 0.5\% and 1.0\% dietary alpha-LA supplements.
   No difference in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase was observed
   between the 0.5\% and 1.0\% dietary alpha-LA treatments. Dietary
   alpha-LA had no significant influence on the activity of pyruvate kinase
   in postmortem muscle. All these results indicate that AMPK plays a role
   in glycolysis in postmortem muscle. Dietary alpha-LA supplementation can
   suppress the activation of AMPK in postmortem muscle, down-regulate the
   activity of glycogen phosphorylase, resulting in a higher ultimate pH
   values in postmortem muscle. Therefore, dietary alpha-LA supplementation
   is a potential way to reduce the incidence of pale, soft, exudative
   (PSE) meat. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of nanoindentation in single crystals are performed using a
   finite temperature coupled atomistic/continuum discrete dislocation
   (CADD) method. This computational method for multiscale modeling of
   plasticity has the ability of treating dislocations as either atomistic
   or continuum entities within a single computational framework. The
   finite-temperature approach here inserts a Nose-Hoover thermostat to
   control the instantaneous fluctuations of temperature inside the
   atomistic region during the indentation process. The method of
   thermostatting the atomistic region has a significant role on mitigating
   the reflected waves from the atomistic/continuum boundary and preventing
   the region beneath the indenter from overheating. The method captures,
   at the same time, the atomistic mechanisms and the long-range
   dislocation effects without the computational coat of full atomistic
   simulations. The effects of several process variables are investigated,
   including system temperature and rate of indentation. Results and the
   deformation mechanisms that occur during a series of indentation
   simulations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection disrupts tight
   junctions (TJs) and perturbs intestinal barrier function in vitro. E.
   coli secreted protein F (EspF) is, in large part, responsible for these
   physiological and morphological alterations. We recently reported that
   the C57BL/6J mouse is a valid in vivo model of EPEC infection as EPEC
   colonizes the intestinal epithelium and effaces microvilli. Our current
   aim was to examine the effects of EPEC on TJ structure and barrier
   function of the mouse intestine and to determine the role of EspF in
   vivo. C57BL/6J mice were gavaged with similar to 2 x 10(8) EPEC
   organisms or PBS. At 1 or 5 days postinfection, mice were killed and
   ileal and colonic tissue was mounted in Ussing chambers to determine
   barrier function ( measured as transepithelial resistance) and short
   circuit current. TJ structure was analyzed by immunofluorescence
   microscopy. Wild-type (WT) EPEC significantly diminished the barrier
   function of ileal and colonic mucosa at 1 and 5 days postinfection.
   Deficits in barrier function correlated with redistribution of occludin
   in both tissues. Infection with an EPEC strain deficient of EspF (Delta
   espF) had no effect on barrier function at 1 day postinfection.
   Furthermore, DespF had no effect on ileal TJ morphology and minor
   alterations of colonic TJ morphology at 1 day postinfection. In
   contrast, at 5 days postinfection, WT EPEC and DespF had similar effects
   on barrier function and occludin localization. In both cases this was
   associated with immune activation, as demonstrated by increased mucosal
   tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels 5 days postinfection. In conclusion,
   these data demonstrate that WT EPEC infection of 6 - 8-week-old C57BL/6J
   mice ( 1) significantly decreases barrier function in the ileum and
   colon ( 2) redistributes occludin in the ileum and colon and ( 3) is
   dependent upon EspF to induce TJ barrier defects at early, but not late,
   times postinfection.}},

Abstract = {{A proteomic differential display technique was utilized to study
   cellular responses of Phanerochaete chrysosporium exposed to vanillin,
   one of the key intermediates found during lignin biodegradation.
   Intracellular proteins were resolved by 2-DE and target protein spots
   were identified using MALDINS after in-gel tryptic digestions. Upon
   addition of vanillin to P. chrysosporium, up-regulation of homogentisate
   1,2-dioxygenase, 1,4-benzoquinone reductases, aldehyde dehydrogenase,
   and aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase, which seem to play roles in vanillin
   metabolism, was observed. Furthermore, enzymes involved in glycolysis,
   the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the pentosephosphate cycle, and heme
   biosynthesis were also activated. Up-regulation of extracellular
   peroxidase was also observed. One of the most unique phenomena against
   exogenous vanillin was a switch from the glyoxylate cycle to the
   tricarboxylic acid cycle, where a drastic increase in isocitrate
   dehydrogenase activity was observed. The exogenous addition of other
   aromatic compounds also caused an increase in its activity, which in
   turn triggered NAD(P)H production via the action of dehydrogenases in
   the tricarboxylic acid cycle, heme biosynthesis via the action of
   aminolevulinic acid synthase on succinyl-CoA, and energy production via
   activation of the mitochondrial electron transfer system. These
   metabolic shifts seem to be required for activating a metabolic system
   for aromatic compounds.}},

   for services, as measured by the presence of a mental health problem,
   was only partially related to mental health services received. Logistic

Title = {{Derivation of elemental abundance maps at intermediate resolution from
   optical interpolation of lunar prospector gamma-ray spectrometer data}},
Journal = {{PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2005}},

Abstract = {{We propose a technique that interpolates available lunar prospector
   gamma-ray spectrometer (GRS) data using Clementine UVVIS spectral
   reflectance images. The main idea is to use low resolution GRS data as a
   ``ground truth{''} to establish relationships linking optical data and
   geochemical information maximizing the respective correlation
   coefficients. Then the relationships and Clementine UVVIS data are used
   to derive elemental abundance maps with significantly improved spatial
   resolution. The main limitation of the technique is its dependence on
   how well the abundance of the elements correlates with the Clementine
   UVVIS data. The technique can also be applied to analysis of coming
   D-CIXS/Smart-1 and AMIE/Smart-1 data to increase resolution of lunar
   compositional maps. As an illustration of the suggested technique, maps
   for the elements Fe, Ti, O, Al, Ca, and Mg with pixel size 15 km x 15 km
   are presented. The Fe and Ti distributions resemble qualitatively to the
   maps obtained with the well-known technique by lucey et al. (2000a.
   Lunar iron and titanium abundance algorithms based on final processing
   of Clementine ultraviolet-visible images. J. Geophys. Res. 105,
   20,297-20,306), though in our case the ranges of Fe and Ti variations
   are, respectively, wider and narrower than for lucey's maps. New maps
   for the elements Fe, Ti, 0, Al, Ca, and Mg appear to be informative. For
   instance, the map of oxygen abundance demonstrates an anomaly in the
   crater Tycho. The maps of Fe and Al contents show for highland regions
   slight variations related to maturity degree. Reliability of this
   relation is confirmed with lunar sample data. The reason of the
   correlation between chemical composition and exposition age of the lunar
   surface can be the global transport of the lunar surface material due to
   meteorite impacts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   21-hydroxylase deficiency, five with 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency), to
   determine the frequency of mutations in the CYP21A2 gene and attempt a
   genotype-phenotype correlation in patients with 21-hydroxylase
   deficiency.
   Design: Molecular analysis was performed by direct sequencing of PCR
   amplified products of the CYP21A2 and CYP11B1 genes.
   Results: The most frequent mutation in Romanian patients with
   21-hydroxylase deficiency was I2G (43.9\%), followed by deletions and
   large conversions (16.7\%), I172N and the triple mutation (P30L + I2G +
   del8bp), accounting for 12.1\% each, P30L (7.6\%) and R356W (1.5\%).
   Genotypes were categorized in three mutation groups ( 0, A, and B),
   according to their predicted functional consequences, and compared with
   clinical phenotype. Positive predictive values were 100, 75, and 100\%
   for groups 0, A, and B, respectively. Overall genotype-phenotype
   correlation was 87.88\%. In the five patients with 11 beta-hydroxylase
   deficiency, the following homozygous mutations were identified: T318R in
   two related patients; R448H in two unrelated patients; and P94L, a new,
   yet-undescribed mutation.
   Conclusion: The present study is the first countrywide report of
   mutational analysis in a Romanian patient population with 21-hydroxylase
   deficiency. Molecular diagnosis was performed in a small number of CAH
   patients proved not to suffer from 21-hydroxylase deficiency but from 11
   beta-hydroxylase deficiency, and a new mutation was identified.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing research indicates that concepts are represented as
   distributed circuits of property information across the brain's
   modality-specific areas. The current study examines the distributed
   representation of an important but under-explored category, foods.
   Participants viewed pictures of appetizing foods (along with pictures of
   locations for comparison) during event-related fMRI. Compared to
   location pictures, food pictures activated the right insula/operculum
   and the left orbitofrontal cortex, both gustatory processing areas. Food
   pictures also activated regions of visual cortex that represent object
   shape. Together these areas contribute to a distributed neural circuit
   that represents food knowledge. Not only does this circuit become active
   during the tasting of actual foods, it also becomes active while viewing
   food pictures. Via the process of pattern completion, food pictures
   activate gustatory regions of the circuit to produce conceptual
   inferences about taste. Consistent with theories that ground knowledge
   in the modalities, these inferences arise as reenactments of
   modality-specific processing.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Occipital lobe arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) provide
   challenging management decisions because of their proximity to the
   Visual cortex and optic radiations. Preservation of visual function
   throughout treatment is the mainstay of therapeutic planning. We
   reviewed visual field (VF) outcomes of all patients who received
   curative treatment for occipital AVMs at Stanford University to evaluate
   the efficacy of different treatment strategies.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 55 patients with
   occipital AVMs treated at Stanford University between 1984 and 2003.
   Clinical presentation, AVM morphology, and treatment modality were
   correlated with VF function before and after therapeutic intervention.
   RESULTS: Of 55 patients, 48 (87.31\%) underwent multimodality AVM
   treatment (7 patients < 3 yr from radiosurgery were excluded from final
   analysis). One patient died from intracerebral hemorrhage I I months
   post-radiosurgery, and five patients deferred further treatment.
   Forty-two patients (87.5\%) were Cured, with no residual AVM on final
   angiography. Curative therapeutic modalities used included embolization
   alone (2 patients), microsurgery alone (6 patients), microsurgery with
   radiosurgery (1 patient), microsurgery with embolization (23 patients),
   radiosurgery with embolization (4 patients), and embolization with
   radiosurgery and microsurgery (6 patients). Mean follow-up was 5.8 years
   including treatment. VF follow-up was available in all 42 patients.
   Twenty-eight (66.7\%) patients experienced no change in VFs, six
   (14.3\%) patients with previously abnormal VFs improved, and eight
   (19.0\%) patients showed worsening of VFs (although none developed a new
   homonymous VF deficit). Duration of treatment was related to VF outcome
   in patients who presented without a history of AVM-related hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSION: Occipital AVMs can be safely cured using multimodality
   strategies with minimal risk to visual function despite the proximity of
   these lesions to the visual cortex and associated pathways.}},

Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{Six cannulated wether sheep weighing 57 (s.d. 4.3) kg were used to
   investigate the susceptibility of unprotected and protected n-3
   polyunsaturated fatty acids from different sources to biohydrogenation
   in the rumen, their uptake into plasma and effects on ruminal
   metabolism. The sheep were assigned to one of six dietary treatments
   formulated to have a similar fatty acid content (60 g/kg DM) and
   containing : linseed oil (LO), linseed oil absorbed into vermiculite
   (VLO), formic acid-formaldehyde treated whole linseed (FLS), fish oil
   (FO), fat encapsulated fish oil (PFO) or a mixture of fish oil and
   marine algae (1 : 1 on an oil basis; AF), in six periods of 28 days
   duration in a Latin-square design. Biohydrogenation of C-20:5(n- 3) and
   C-22:6(n-3) was high in FO at approximately 870 g/kg, but reduced to 625
   and 625 g/kg respectively for PFO, and 769 and 601 g/kg respectively for
   AF. Ruminal biohydrogenation of C-18:3(n-3) was similar across
   treatments based on linseed, averaging 860 g/kg, but C-18: 2(n-6) was
   lower (P<0.05) in animals given VLO or FLS at 792 and 837 g/kg
   respectively, compared with LO (907 g/kg). Duodenal. flow of C-18:1
   trans in animals given any of the diets containing. fish oil averaged
   8.4 g/day compared with 2.8g/day in animals given diets based on linseed
   (P<0.001), whilst cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid was not
   significantly different among treatments. Plasma C-20:5(n-3) and C-22
   :6(n-3) proportions were highest in animals given the AF diet (11.8 and
   8.2 g per 100 g of the total fatty acids respectively) and lowest in
   animals given LO (2.8 and 2.7 g per 100 g of the total fatty acids
   respectively; P<0.001). By contrast, plasma C-18:3(n-3) proportions were
   highest in animals given the LO or VLO diets at approximately 6.9 g per
   100 g of the total fatty acids, and lowest in the AF treatment at 0.9 g
   per 100 g (P< 0.001). Duodenal non-ammonia-N. flow was similar among
   treatments at 21.0 g/day except in animals given FLS which had the
   highest flow (25.9 g N per day; P<0.01). Microbial N flow was also
   similar among treatments whilst microbial efficiency (g N per kg OM
   truly degraded in the rumen) was higher (P<0.05) in animals given FLS
   than LO, FO or AF. By contrast, ruminal. fibre digestion was higher
   (P<0.05) in animals given LO or FO than those offered VLO, FLS, PFO or
   AF. In conclusion, compared with linseed oil, absorption of linseed oil
   into vermiculite improved duodenal. flow but not plasma levels of
   C-18:3(n-3), whilst formic acid-formaldehyde treatment of linseed had
   little effect on protecting C-18:3(n-3) in the rumen, although duodenal
   non-ammonia nitrogen. flow and microbial efficiency were improved.
   Compared with fish oil, the provision of marine algae or fat
   encapsulated. fish oil resulted in a lower biohydrogenation of
   C-22:6(n-3) and C-20:5(n- 3), and an increased duodenal flow and plasma
   concentration and offers the potential to favourably manipulate the n-3
   fatty acid composition of sheep meat.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel slotted ALOHA-based protocol for use in ad
   hoc networks where nodes are equipped with adaptive array smart
   antennas. The protocol relies on the ability of the antenna and DoA (
   Direction of Arrival) algorithms to identify the direction of
   transmitters and then beamform appropriately to maximize SINR ( Signal
   to Interference and Noise Ratio) at the receiver. The performance of the
   protocol is evaluated using analytical modeling as well as detailed
   simulation in OPNET and Matlab where we demonstrate the benefits of
   using smart antennas. The impact of using different number of antenna
   elements is also studied for this environment.}},

Abstract = {{Sixty-six patients with acute scaphoid fractures were treated
   non-operatively in a below elbow plaster for 8 to 12 weeks and underwent
   CT scans along the longitudinal axis of the scaphoid at 12 to 18 weeks.
   These scans showed that 14 fractures had not united and that 30 had
   united throughout the whole cross-section of the scaphoid. The other 22
   had partially united with bridging trabeculae in some areas of the
   cross-section. These 22 partial unions were graded as 0\% to 24\% union
   (0 cases), 25\% to 49\% union (5 cases), 50\% to 74\% union (7 cases),
   and 75\% to 99\% union (10 cases). The 12 patients who had less than
   75\% fracture union were followed-up further and nine underwent another
   CT scan at 23 to 40 weeks after the initial injury. These showed union
   across the whole of the cross-section of the fracture in seven cases and
   75\% to 99\% union in the other two cases, who had full and painless
   wrist function. We conclude that partial union of the scaphoid is a
   common occurrence but, in most cases, it progresses to full union
   without the need for prolonged plaster immobilization.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study compared three-dimensional representations of
   DSM-IV personality disorders and standard categories with respect to
   their associations with psychosocial functioning.
   Method: Six hundred sixty-eight patients with semistructured interview
   diagnoses of schizotypal, borderline, avoidant, or obsessive-compulsive
   personality disorders or with major depressive disorder and no
   personality disorder completed questionnaires assessing three-factor and
   five-factor dimensional models of personality. Personality disorder
   categories, dimensional representations of the categories based on
   criteria counts, and three- and five-factor personality dimensions were
   compared on their relationships to impairment in seven domains of
   functioning, as measured by the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up
   Evaluation-Baseline Version.
   Results: Both the categorical and dimensional representations of DSM-IV
   personality disorders had stronger relationships to impairment in
   functioning in the domains of employment, social relationships with
   parents and friends, and global social adjustment and to DSM-IV axis V
   ratings than the three- and five-factor models. DSM-IV dimensions
   predicted functional impairment best of the four approaches. Although
   five-factor personality traits captured variance in functional
   impairment not predicted by DSM-IV personality disorder dimensions, the
   DSM-IV dimensions accounted for significantly more variance than the
   measures of personality.
   Conclusions: Scores on dimensions of general personality functioning do
   not appear to be as strongly associated with functional impairment as
   the psychopathology of DSM personality disorder. A compromise in the
   ongoing debate over categories versus dimensions of personality disorder
   might be the dimensional rating of the criteria that comprise
   traditional categories.}},

Journal = {{CHEST}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Birth prevalence and survival in patients with cystic
   fibrosis (CF) in the Netherlands were last investigated > 30 years ago.
   However, since then the birth prevalence may have decreased because of
   genetic counseling and an increased number of newborns of non-European
   descent. Although survival of CF patients has increased worldwide, a
   significantly lower median age at death was recently reported in the
   Netherlands compared with data from the United States.
   Objectives: To analyze birth prevalence and survival in CF patients in
   the Netherlands, and to compare this survival data with US CF data.
   Design: Survey of all CF patients living in the Netherlands, and
   analysis of Dutch CF mortality statistics using data from the Dutch
   central statistics office, Statistics Netherlands (Voorburg, the
   Netherlands), and a comparison with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation
   (Bethesda, MD) patient registry data.
   Setting: All CF centers in the Netherlands and the United States.
   Participants: All CF patients treated in the Netherlands on January 1,
   2001, and all persons who died of CF between 1974 and 2000, and an
   equivalent US population.
   Measurements: Birth prevalence and birth cohort-specific survival.
   Results: The overall birth prevalence of CF for 1974 to 1994 was 1 in
   4,750 live births, which is a considerable decrease compared with 1961
   to 1965 (1 in 3,600 live births). Estimated survival to 30 years
   increased from 6\% in the 1950-to-1954 cohort, to 36\% in the
   1970-to-1973 cohort. Exact survival could be calculated from 1974
   onwards. Survival to 15 years increased from 72\% from the 1974-to-1979
   cohort, to 91\% in the 1985-to-1989 cohort. Survival in the United
   States in the 1980-to-1984 cohort was better compared to the
   Netherlands, but this difference has disappeared over subsequent
   cohorts.
   Conclusions: The actual birth prevalence of CF in the Netherlands is
   clearly lower than it was 30 years ago. Survival in CF has dramatically
   improved. The difference in survival between the Netherlands and the
   United States, as observed in the cohorts born > 20 years ago, has
   disappeared.}},

Abstract = {{The protein C anticoagulant pathway serves as a vitally important system
   limiting the coagulation response. The pathway is triggered by thrombin
   allowing the trombin-thrombomodulin (TM)-endothelial protein C receptor
   (EPCR) complex to activate protein C. The discovery of the protein C
   pathway and genetic defects affecting the system in relation to the risk
   of venous thrombosis directed most research attention towards its
   anti-coagulatory properties. The observation that activated protein C
   (APC) has potentially important functions in controlling inflammation
   and functioning as a natural defence against sepsis, redirected research
   into its cellular functions. Intracellular signaling effects in
   endothelial cells induced by APC depend on the presence of the
   endothelial protein C receptor and protease activated receptor-1 and
   involves a variety of distinct signal transduction pathways engaged in
   various biological activities. However, the exact mechanism by which the
   protein C pathway controls inflammation during sepsis and to what extend
   the signaling capacity of APC contributes to its pro-survival effects
   remains elusive. Other essential factors of the protein C pathway, like
   EPCR and TM may themselves be directly involved in regulating
   inflammation, underlining the importance of the complete pathway.}},

   cortisol over a nychthemeron. Channel catfish fingerlings were
   acclimated for two weeks under a 12L:12D photoperiod, then fed or fasted
   for 21 d. On day 2 1, blood samples were collected every 2 h for 24 h.
   Weight of fed fish increased an average of 66.2\% and fasted fish lost
   21.7\% of body weight on average. Average nychthemeral concentrations of
   plasma GH were not significantly different between fed (24.7 ng/mL) and
   fasted (26.8 ng/mL) fish, but average nychthemeral IGF-I concentrations
   were higher in fed (23.4 ng/mL) versus fasted (17.8 ng/mL) fish. An
   increase in plasma IGF-I concentrations was observed in fasted fish 2 h
   after a peak in plasma GH, but not in fed fish. Average nychthemeral
   plasma cortisol concentrations were higher in fed (14.5 ng/mL) versus
   fasted (11.0 ng/mL) fish after 21 d. Significant fluctuations and a
   postprandial increase in plasma cortisol were observed in fed fish and
   there was an overall increase in plasma cortisol of both fasted and fed
   fish during the scotophase. The present experiment indicates little or
   no effect of 21-d fasting on plasma GH levels but demonstrates
   fasting-induced suppression of plasma IGF-I and cortisol levels in
   channel catfish. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative investigations, including two aquifer tests and development
   of a three-dimensional (3D) groundwater flow model, were required to
   determine the hydraulic connection between an irrigation reservoir and a
   buried valley aquifer in southern Alberta. Evidence of seepage was
   detected in the buried valley aquifer 10 km east of the Pine Coulee
   reservoir at the onset of filling in 1999, when the reservoir level
   exceeded an elevation of 1035 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Concern for an
   increase in the local water table and the creation of artesian
   conditions in the aquifer prompted this study to determine the
   approximate location of a seepage window that appeared to be connecting
   the reservoir and aquifer. Observations of hydraulic head in the aquifer
   during the pumping tests revealed a barrier boundary when the reservoir
   level was at an elevation of 1035 m a.s.l. and a recharge boundary
   condition when the elevation exceeded 1039 m a.s.l. These data were used
   to calibrate a 3D groundwater flow model, which was needed to determine
   the hydraulic properties and approximate location of the leakage zone.
   The quantitative investigation showed that seepage likely occurred
   through the sideslopes of the flooded coulee, rather than through the
   low-permeability coulee floor sediments or the embankment dam. Further
   simulations illustrated the expected seepage rates at various reservoir
   supply levels and the pumping rates required for relief wells installed
   in the buried valley aquifer to maintain historic aquifer hydraulic
   head. A brief postanalysis indicated that the forecasted pumping rates
   were only 15\% lower than have been required to maintain preconstruction
   water levels in the buried valley aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess clinical heterogeneity across two studies with
   respect to study population, interventions, and outcome measures, and to
   evaluate the influence of these sources of heterogeneity on the results
   of the studies.
   Methods: The individual patient data were used from two randomised
   controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of conservative
   treatments in patients with tennis elbow in primary care. Patients were
   allocated at random to treatment with steroid injection, wait and see
   policy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, placebo tablets, or
   physiotherapy. Outcome measures included severity of the main complaint,
   inconvenience of the elbow complaints, pain during the day, elbow
   disability, pain-free grip strength, and global improvement. All
   outcomes were assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months after randomisation.
   Results: The two study populations were similar with respect to age,
   sex, comorbid neck/shoulder complaints, and baseline scores for the
   severity of pain. However, significant differences were observed for
   employment status, duration of elbow complaints, dominant side affected,
   previous history of elbow complaints, and use of analgesics. Local
   injections differed between the two studies with respect to volume,
   number, and steroid preparation. However, after 1, 6, and 12 months, the
   treatment effects of steroid injections were very similar between the
   study populations.
   Conclusions: Despite large differences in study population at baseline,
   the responses to steroid injections were remarkably similar. Also the
   responses to other conservative interventions and the placebo treatment
   were very consistent, suggesting a uniform course of a tennis elbow and
   a lack of influence of clinical heterogeneity.}},

   rather, ethics should shape the design of institutions that regulate

Volume = {{130}},

Pages = {{1763-1777}},

Abstract = {{We present a new 11.7 mu m mosaic image of the inner Orion Nebula
   obtained with the T-ReCS instrument on Gemini South. The map covers
   2.'7; 1.'6, with a diffraction-limited spatial resolution of 0.'' 35; it
   includes the BN/KL region, the Trapezium, and OMC-1 South. Excluding
   BN/KL, we detect 91 thermal-IR point sources, with 27 known proplyds and
   over 30 ``naked{''} stars showing no extended structure in Hubble Space
   Telescope (HST) images. Within the region we surveyed, similar to 80\%
   of known proplyds show detectable thermal-IR emission, almost 40\% of
   naked stars are detected at 11.7 mu m, and the fraction of all visible
   sources with 11.7 mu m excess emission (including both proplyds and
   stars with unresolved disks) is roughly 50\%. These fractions exclude
   embedded sources. Thermal dust emission from stars exhibiting no
   extended structure in HST images is surprising and means that they have
   retained circumstellar dust disks comparable to the size of our solar
   system. Proplyds and stars with IR excess are not distributed randomly
   in the nebula; instead, they show a clear anticorrelation in their
   spatial distribution, with proplyds clustered close to theta(1) Ori C
   and other IR sources found preferentially farther away. We suspect that
   the clustered proplyds trace the youngest similar to 0.5 Myr age group
   associated with the Trapezium, while the more uniformly distributed
   sources trace the older 1-2 Myr population of the Orion Nebula Cluster.
   This suggests that small protoplanetary disks persist for a few million
   years in irradiated environments and hints that hierarchical
   subclustering has been important on similar to 30 `' scales around the
   Trapezium. We detect 11.7 mu m emission from the five brightest members
   of the Trapezium (theta(1) Ori A, B, C, D, and E), caused by free-free
   stellar wind emission and possibly emission from dusty disks around
   companion stars. Within 30 `' of theta(1) Ori C, 100\% of known proplyds
   are detected at 11.7 mu m, and they exhibit remarkable limb-brightened
   dust arcs at the collision of the proplyd mass loss and the wind from
   theta(1) Ori C. The star theta(1) Ori D is associated with the most
   prominent mid-IR dust arc of the Ney-Allen Nebula. We propose that this
   arc is the consequence of theta(1) Ori D being the closest member of the
   Trapezium to the background cloud. Finally, we detect dust emission from
   Herbig-Haro jets in Orion, including HH 202, 529, 513, and 514. This is
   the first detection of mid-IR continuum emission from dust in the body
   of a collimated HH jet or bow shock. The presence of dust implies that
   some jet material must be lifted from large radii in the accretion disk
   (outside the dust sublimation radius) or entrained from the
   circumstellar environment.}},

Abstract = {{We report a systematic study of the optoelectronic processes occurring
   in composites made of near-infrared (IR) emitting nanocrystals and
   conjugated polymers. We focus on PbSe and InAs/ZnSe blended with
   polyphenylenevinylene-type polymers. We find that the process
   responsible for quenching the visible luminescence of the polymer by the
   nanocrystal varies depending on the nanocrystal composite. Moreover, the
   high (66\%) energy-transfer efficiency from the polymer to the PbSe
   nanocrystal does result in significant emission at the near IR. Our
   measurements suggest that the host may be doping the PbSe nanocrystal,
   thus making the nonradiative Auger process favorable. For InAs we find
   the energy levels well aligned inside the polymer band gap, making it an
   efficient charge trap which acts as a luminescence center. Through
   two-dimensional numerical modeling of the charge transport in such
   composite films we highlight the importance of morphology (nanocrystal
   distribution) control. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-activity of a short-tailed chain hydrocarbon surfactant,
   heptane-1-sulfonic acid sodium salt (C7SNa), was studied by using
   surface tension and conductivity measurements, which the
   surface-activity was improved largely by the addition of small amount of
   a fluorosurfactant,
   1H,1H,2H,2H,3H,3H,4H,4H-heneicosafluorotetradecylpyridinium iodine
   (HFTPI). The phase behavior and vesicle formation of C-H/C-F surfactant
   mixtures in aqueous solutions are similar to ones of cationic-anionic
   surfactant (catanionic) systems. The birefringent, viscoelastic L
   alpha-phase consisting of unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles can be
   observed, which were determined by freeze-fracture transmission electron
   microscopy (FF-TEM) images. The theological properties of L alpha-phase
   samples were measured. H-1 and F-19 NMR spectra were measured to monitor
   the information of self-assemblies Of C7SNa and HFTPI in L-1-phase
   (spherical micelles) and L alpha-phase (vesicles). The results show that
   the C-H micelles and C-F micelles form in aqueous solutions
   individually. In L alpha-phase (vesicles), the interaction between
   anionic hydrocarbon (C7SNa) and cationic fluorocarbon (HFTPI)
   surfactants exist due to the strong electric static interaction of
   opposite charge head groups. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Genetic variability of South African fiscal shrikes (Lanius collaris)
   across an altitudinal gradient}},
Journal = {{AFRICAN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{193-204}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{An electrophoretic allozyme study of the fiscal shrike Lanius collaris,
   a widely distributed sub-Saharan passerine, was undertaken to
   investigate altitudinal variation in genetic structure within this
   species. It is a sedentary bird with limited dispersal so that
   subpopulations may be expected to show genetic isolation by distance,
   which may have been enhanced by Pleistocene glaciation effects. The
   study area was a linear altitudinal transect of four localities in the
   eastern half of South Africa, which ranged from sea level to an altitude
   of 1800 m, with the geographic distance between the furthest
   subpopulations being 300 km. Fourteen (40\%) of the 35 electrophoretic
   loci examined were polymorphic. The mean percentage of polymorphic loci
   within populations, mean heterozygosity and mean number of alleles per
   locus were 0.519, 0.272 and 1.60, respectively. These values were much
   higher than those reported for most other avian species. The negative
   FIs and FIT values indicated a small excess of heterozygotes. The
   populations are only weakly differentiated genetically (FIT = 0.076).
   Rogers' (1972) mean genetic distance (D) was 0.094, and Nei's (1978)
   mean unbiased genetic distance was 0.019. A phenogram (unweighted pair
   group method) and a phylogenetic tree (distance Wagner network), both
   based on Rogers' (1972) distance, showed some degree of geographical
   subgrouping. The high mean value for the effective number of migrants
   (Nm) among demes indicated that 3.04 individuals were exchanged among
   demes per generation. The mean value for local genetic differentiation
   (FIT) and Nm indicated levels of gene flow between the different
   localities of fiscal shrike subpopulations. The Mantel test indicated
   that there was no significant relationship between the FIT values and
   the geographical distances between sample pairs. This study showed that
   the isolation-by-distance model of subpopulation structure is
   inappropriate for these birds. Juvenile natal dispersal distances,
   female divorce rates (every three years) and the distance of travel of
   females (although low) appear to be sufficient to maintain high levels
   of polymorphism and heterozygosity. These levels of polymorphism and
   heterozygosity, together with large amounts of gene flow and the general
   lack of spatial autocorrelation imply that the populations of L.
   collaris may be subject to high rates of random drift. High values of
   sample heterozygosity suggest that fiscal shrike subpopulations have
   been stable for a long period and that genetic diversity has accumulated
   within populations. The rates of migration suggest that the
   `subpopulations' of fiscal shrike act more or less as a single
   population extending over at least 300 km.}},

Abstract = {{The flow of various liquids and gases over single-walled carbon nanotube
   bundles induces an electrical signal (voltage/current) in the sample
   along the direction of the flow. The electrical response generated by
   the flow of liquids is found to be logarithmic in the flow speed over a
   wide range. In contrast, voltage generated by the flow of gas is
   quadratically dependent on the gas flow velocity. It was found that the
   underlying physics for the generation of electrical signals by liquids
   and gases are different. For the liquid, the Coulombic interaction
   between the ions in the liquid and the charge carriers in the nanotube
   plays a key role while electrical signal generation due to gas flow is
   due to an interplay of Bernoulli's principle and Seebeck effect. Unlike
   the liquid case which is specific to the nanotubes, the gas flow effect
   can be seen for a variety of solids ranging from single and multi-walled
   carbon nanotubes, graphite and doped semiconductors.}},

Abstract = {{Aging and certain diseases such as HIV-related liprodystrophy are
   associated with reduced levels of growth hormone (GH) and/or
   insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Unfortunately, GH injections do
   not mimic the pulsatile pattern of endogenous GH secretion and are often
   associated with unwanted effects. Administration of human growth
   hormone-releasing factor (hGRF) could raise GH levels in a more
   physiological manner, thereby avoiding unwanted effects but its
   elimination half-life is short. Researchers have therefore focused on
   creating GRF analogues for the treatment of GH deficiency. TH-9507
   (ThGRF{[}1-44]) is one such hGRF analogue that exhibits increased
   stability and half-life. The agent was shown to increase circulating GH
   and lGF-1 and induce pulsatile GH secretion in preclinical models.
   TH-9507 has also been shown to be effective in clinical trials in
   elderly subjects and patients with COPD-related wasting and
   HIV-associated lipodystrophy, and is in phase II and I I I development
   for the treatment of wasting and HIV-associated lipodystrophy,

Abstract = {{The development and validation of a two phase (aqueous-gas) integrated
   mixed weak acid/base chemical, physical and biological processes kinetic
   model for anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge are described. The
   biological kinetic processes for AD are integrated into a two phase
   subset of the three phase mixed weak acid/base chemistry kinetic model
   of Musvoto et al. (1997, 2000a,b,c). The approach of characterising
   sewage sludge into carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, as is done in the
   International Water Association (IWA) AD model No 1 (ADM1, Batstone et
   al., 2002), requires measurements that are not routinely available on
   sewage sludges. Instead, the sewage sludge is characterised with the
   COD, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen (CHON) composition. The model
   is formulated in mole units, based on conservation of C, N, O, H and
   COD. The model is calibrated and validated with data from laboratory
   mesophilic anaerobic digesters operating from 7 to 20 d sludge age and
   fed a sewage primary and humus sludge mixture. These digesters yielded
   COD mass balances between 107 and 109\% and N mass balances between 91
   and 99\%, and hence the experimental data is accepted as reasonable. The
   sewage sludge is found to be 64 to 68\% biodegradable (depending on the
   kinetic formulation selected for the hydrolysis process) and to have a
   C3.5H7O2N0.196 composition. For the selected hydrolysis kinetics of
   surface mediated reaction (Contois), with a single set of kinetic and
   stoichiometric constants, for all retention times good correlation is
   obtained between predicted and measured results for:
   COD,
   free and saline ammonia (FSA),
   short chain fatty acids (SCFA),
   H2CO3{*} alkalinity and pH of the effluent stream, and
   CO2 and CH4 gases in the gas stream.
   The measured composition of primary sludge from two local wastewater
   treatment plants ranged between C3.38H7O1.91N0.21 and C3.91H7O2.04N0.16.
   The predicted composition is therefore within 5\% of the average
   measured composition providing persuasive validation of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Groups of inbred alloxan-induced diabetic rats were treated with insulin

   untreated diabetic (D) control groups were concurrently included. Each
   group was divided into five subgroups of 10 rats and killed after
   follow-up of 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Clinical and laboratory
   parameters were recorded, and kidney ultrastructural and morphometric
   analyses performed in each 12-month subgroup, namely glomerular basement
   membrane (GM) thickening, podocyte number, and number/extension of slit
   diaphragms (S). Rats from the I group showed poor metabolic control of
   diabetes compared with N group control rats. However, successfully
   transplanted rats (IT and PT) had complete restoration to normal levels
   for all metabolic parameters. GM thickening was significantly higher in
   diabetic compared with control rats. In contrast, the numbers of
   podocytes and slits as well as slit extensions were significantly
   decreased. Insulin therapy did not prevent any alterations upon
   comparison of diabetic vs control rats. Despite good metabolic control
   in IT rats, the degree of kidney lesion control never compared with that
   achieved in PT rats. In this group all glomerular changes were similar
   to the age-dependent lesions observed in control rats. We conclude that
   either IT or PT may be a good option for diabetes treatment, although
   pancreas transplantation seems to be the most effective treatment to
   control chronic complications.}},

   Doppler}},
Journal = {{PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{25}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background Previous studies have shown an association between low first
   trimester maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A and subsequent
   development of pregnancy complications. Similarly, uterine artery
   Doppler in the late second trimester has shown that high impedance to
   flow is associated with increased risk for preeclampsia and fetal growth
   restriction. The objective of this study is to determine whether there
   is an association between the maternal serum concentration of PAPP-A and
   free beta-hCG at 11-13(+6) weeks with the uterine artery pulsatility
   index (PI) at 22-24 weeks, and secondly, to compare the screening
   characteristics of the two methods in the prediction of adverse
   pregnancy outcome.
   Methods Maternal serum PAPP-A and free beta-hCG at 11-13(+6) weeks and
   uterine artery PI at 22-24 weeks were measured in 4390 women with
   singleton pregnancies. Pregnancies with chromosomal defects or fetal
   anomalies were excluded. The biochemical and Doppler measurements were
   compared between those with normal outcome and those resulting in
   spontaneous preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction
   (FGR). Detection rates using a combination of the biochemical and
   Doppler measurements were investigated.
   Results In the pregnancies resulting in pre-eclampsia (n = 64) and FGR
   (n = 172), the median PAPP-A was lower (0.844 and 0.813 MoM), the median
   uterine artery mean PI was higher (1.56 and 1.18) but the median free
   beta hCG was not significantly different (0.923 and 0.933 MoM) than in
   the normal outcome group. In the preterm delivery group (n = 159), the
   median free beta-hCG (0.944 MoM) and uterine artery mean PI (1.06) were
   not significantly different from normal but the median PAPP-A (0.928
   MoM) was significantly lower than normal. In screening for
   pre-eclampsia, the detection rate, for a 5\% false-positive rate, was
   14.1\% for PAPP-A, 54.7\% for uterine artery mean PI and 62.1\% for a
   combination of PAPP-A and uterine artery mean PI.
   Conclusion Maternal serum PAPP-A at 11-13(+6) of gestation is
   significantly lower in adverse pregnancy outcomes. The combination of
   first trimester serum PAPP-A and uterine artery mean PI at 22-24 weeks
   improves the screening efficacy for the prediction of pre-eclampsia.

Abstract = {{Background. Administration of safe and effective iron therapy in
   patients with chronic kidney disease is a time consuming process. This
   phase II clinical trial studied ferumoxytol, a semi-synthetic
   carbohydrate-coated iron oxide administered by rapid intravenous
   injection to anemic chronic kidney disease patients (predialysis or
   undergoing peritoneal dialysis).
   Methods. Inclusion criteria included hemoglobin <= 12.5 g/dL and
   transferrin saturation <= 35\%. Twenty-one adult patients were
   randomized to receive ferumoxytol in a regimen of 4 doses of 255 mg iron
   in 2 weeks or 2 doses of 510 mg iron in 1 to 2 weeks. Ferumoxytol was
   administered at a rate of up to 30 mg iron/sec.
   Results. The maximum hemoglobin response following ferumoxytol
   administration occurred at 6 weeks, increasing from a baseline of 10.4
   +/- 1.3 g/dL to 11.4 +/- 1.2 g/dL (P < 0.05). Ferritin increased from a
   baseline of 232 +/- 216 ng/mL to a maximum of 931 +/- 361 ng/mL at 2
   weeks (P < 0.05), while the baseline transferrin saturation increased
   from 21 +/- 10\% to 37 +/- 22\% at 1 week (P < 0.05). Seven adverse
   events in 5 patients during this trial were deemed possibly related to
   ferumoxytol, none serious. These events included constipation, chills,
   tingling, a gastrointestinal viral syndrome, delayed pruritic
   erythematous rash, and transient pain at the injection site.
   Conclusion. Although larger studies are required, this small study
   demonstrates that ferumoxytol can be safe and effective in increasing
   iron stores, is associated with an increased hemoglobin response, and is
   well tolerated at a rapid infusion rate.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We consider a recently introduced two-dimensional square-to-rectangle
   martensite model that explains several unusual features of martensites
   to study ferromagnetic martensites. The strain order parameter is
   coupled to the magnetic order parameter through a four-state clock
   model. Studies are carried out for several combinations of the ordering
   of the Curie temperatures of the austenite and martensite phases and,
   the martensite transformation temperature. We find that the orientation
   of the magnetic ordering, which generally points along the short axis of
   the rectangular variant, changes as one crosses the twin or the
   martensite-austenite interface. The model shows the possibility of a
   subtle interplay between the growth of strain and magnetic order
   parameters as the temperature is decreased. In some cases, this leads to
   qualitatively different magnetization curves from those predicted by
   earlier mean-field models. Further, we find that strain morphology can
   be substantially altered by the magnetic order. We have also studied the
   dynamic hysteresis behavior. The corresponding dissipation during the
   forward and reverse cycles has features similar to the Barkhausen's
   noise.}},

Abstract = {{Methods to reduce P-cell loss after islet isolation and transplantation
   must be developed if islet transplantation is to become a preferred
   treatment for diabetes. Most recent research has focused on the
   reduction of toxicity from immunosuppressants and the enhancement of
   revascularization by growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth
   factor. Cytoglobin is an intracellular oxygen-binding protein found in
   islet beta-cells, inducible by hypoxia. It is our hypothesis that
   cytoglobin induction and overexpression may improve survival and
   function of transplanted islets by preventing ischemic cell death. Lewis
   rat islets and MIN6 cells were transfected with the cytoglobin gene.
   Control and transfected cells and islets were held for 4 hours at 20\%
   oxygen before glucose challenge. Another group of islets and cells was
   held for 4 hours at 20\% and then 1\% oxygen prior to glucose challenge.
   Untreated or transfected Lewis rat islets (n = 800) were transplanted
   beneath the renal capsule of streptozotocin diabetic Lewis rats. In
   another study, Sprague-Dawley islets were transfected and transplanted
   into streptozotocin diabetic Lewis rats. Fasting blood glucose was used
   as an indicator of islet function and survival. Cytoglobin transfected
   islets and cells retained the ability to secrete insulin at low oxygen
   concentrations in contrast to controls. Cytoglobin over expression
   reduced the development of central islet necrosis after 5 days in tissue
   culture. Cytoglobin inhibited the onset of immunorejection (14 +/- 2
   days) as compared with controls islets (5 +/- 2 days). Cytoglobin
   induction may be a useful adjunct to islet transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Limited time and resources usually characterize environmental decision
   making at policy organizations such as the U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency. In these climates, addressing uncertainty, usually considered a
   flaw in scientific analyses, is often avoided. However, ignoring
   uncertainties can result in unpleasant policy surprises. Furthermore, it
   is important for decisionmakers to know how defensible a chosen policy
   option is over other options when the uncertainties of the data are
   considered. The purpose of this article is to suggest an approach that
   is unique from other approaches in that it considers uncertainty in two
   specific ways-the uncertainty of stakeholder values within a particular
   decision context and data uncertainty in the light of the
   decision-contextual data-values relationship. It is the premise of this
   article that the interaction between data and stakeholder values is
   critical to how the decision options are viewed and determines the
   effect of data uncertainty on the relative acceptability of the decision
   options, making the understanding of this interaction important to
   decisionmakers and other stakeholders. This approach utilizes the
   recently developed decision analysis framework and process,
   multi-criteria integrated resource assessment (MIRA). This article will
   specifically address how MIRA can be used to help decisionmakers better
   understand the importance of uncertainty on the specific (i.e., decision
   contextual) environmental policy options that they are deliberating.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. The optimal management of Candida infective endocarditis
   (IE) is unknown.
   Methods. We reviewed all 879 cases of Candida IE reported from 1966-2002
   in the peer-reviewed literature to better understand the rote of medical
   and surgical therapies. This review included 163 patients from 105
   reports that met our inclusion criteria: 31 cases treated with
   antifungal monotherapy, 25 cases treated with medical antifungal
   combination therapy, and 107 cases treated with adjunctive surgical plus
   medical antifungal therapy. We also used meta-analytic techniques to
   evaluate 22 observational case-series (72 patients) of the 105 reports
   with two or more patients with definite Candida IE.
   Results. We found that in patients who underwent adjunctive surgery
   there was a tower reported proportion of deaths {[}prevalence odds ratio
   (POR)=0.56; 95\% confidence interval (G) = 0.16, 1.99)]. Higher
   mortality was noted in patients treated prior to 1980 (POR = 2.03; 95\%
   CI = 0. 55, 7.61), treated with antifungal monotherapy (POR = 1.49; 95\%
   CI = 0.39, 5.81), infected with Candida parapsilosis (POR = 1.51; 95\%CI
   = 0.41, 5.52), or with left-sided endocarditis (POR = 2.36; 95\%CI =
   0.55, 10.07).
   Conclusions. Medical antifungal therapy of Candida IE is poorly
   characterized, and recent antifungal developments tend promise for those
   patients who cannot undergo surgery. (c) 2005 The British Infection

Abstract = {{A mixture of 16.47 +/- 0.038 L concentrated capsicum oleoresin with
   163.8 +/- 3.63 L water and a total of 17.2 L concentrated soybean oil
   with 177.1 L water was dispensed over five 4.87 m x 4.87 m plots via a
   grid of 128 augured holes (approximate to 15 cm-diameter x approximate
   to 30cm deep) in a compacted, sandy loam soil. During the next 9 days, a
   total of 37 soil samples were obtained from these plots and other
   off-plot areas. Spectrophotometric analyses of dual aliquots of soil
   samples were performed to detect absorbance of capsaicin (lambda(max) at
   282nm). Analysis of variance showed that absorbance readings from points
   of capsicum application (augured holes) were 30-fold greater than for
   samples obtained 30-40 cm distant (F = 19.2 1, df 1/4.22, p < 0.0 105).
   Soybean-oil plot and off-plot soil samples yielded negligible absorbance
   readings. Thus, capsicum oleoresin persisted for >= 10 days in this type

Abstract = {{A common garden study was conducted with seedlings of the interior
   spruce complex {[}Picea glauca (Monch) Voss and Picea. engelmannii Parry
   and their hybrids], comparing seedling height growth using
   openpollinated orchard families and wild-stand (WS) families from the
   same breeding zone. Phenotypic variances of three bulked orchard
   seedlots and three WS seedlots did not differ. Orchard seedlots had
   generally higher within family variance components than WS families. To
   examine year-to-year variation in orchard seedlots, three seedlots,
   composed of the same 18 orchard families collected in three different
   years, were evaluated in the same common garden study. Family mean
   heights within the three crop years were statistically not different;
   however, large rank changes in family mean heights and family variances
   were observed. This study shows that orchard seed derived from breeding
   programs does not reduce phenotypic variability in commercial
   plantations. In spite of the moderate to high selection intensities
   applied to the selection of orchard parents, large amounts of phenotypic
   variation are maintained because of the lack of coancestry in the
   orchard pollen cloud and large temporal variation in mating success and
   fecundity of the various parents contributing to the crop.}},

   first case in which measured neurocognitive abilities were determined
   before, during, and after hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a case of FAS
   involving a teenage male patient. Memory, reaction time, and visual
   motor speed assessments were compared. After 40 hyperbaric treatments
   with 100\% oxygen at 1.5 atmospheres absolute, the patient's performance
   in 6 of 6 categories of the computer-administered test battery improved.
   Word composite (verbal) scores improved from 55\% to 73\%, memory
   composite (visual) scores improved from 38\% to 55\%, reaction time
   composites improved from 1.03 to 0.53 seconds, impulse control composite
   scores improved from 8 to 5, and visual motor speed scores improved from
   18.6 to 19.03. The patient's subjective symptoms diminished 94\%. Six
   months after these treatments, the patient's verbal memory was
   maintained at 73\% without any other interventions; impulsivity
   continued to improve, whereas other indices did not. Thirty-three
   additional treatments continued to improve test performance, with verbal
   memory at 95\%, visual memory at 57\%, and a 100\% reduction of
   subjective symptoms. This patient, with 15-year-matured FAS, benefited

Abstract = {{Efficient elimination of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS)
   correlates with increased cellular survival and organism life span.
   Detoxification of mitochondrial ROS is regulated by induction of the
   nuclear SOD2 gene, which encodes the manganese-dependent superoxide
   dismutase (MnSOD). However, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial
   oxidative stress activates cellular signaling pathways leading to
   induction of nuclear genes are not known. Here we demonstrate that
   release of mROS activates a signal relay pathway in which the
   serine/threonine protein kinase D (PKD) activates the NF-kappa B
   transcription factor, leading to induction of SOD2. Conversely, the
   FOX03a transcription factor is dispensable for mROS-induced SOD2
   induction. PKD-mediated MnSOD expression promotes increased survival of
   cells upon release of mROS, suggesting that mitochondrion-to-nucleus
   signaling is necessary for efficient detoxification mechanisms and
   cellular viability.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation a general relationship between fatigue crack
   growth rate, da/dN, and a two-parameter Delta K and K-max driving force
   is derived using fundamental fatigue (epsilon-N curve) properties. A
   power-law relationship between Delta K and K-max is obtained by relating
   the crack growth rate to the fatigue life of the `process zone'.
   Theoretically, there are four different regions on a log-log plot
   depending on the particular combinations of Delta K and K-max. The
   actual analysis of experimental data indicates only two different
   regions namely, Delta K and K-max dominated, corresponding to high and
   low load ratios, respectively. A new way of representing the da/dN data
   in terms of Delta K and K-max by means of the crack propagation (CP)
   table is proposed. Finally, the application of the CP table for
   predicting crack growth rate under constant amplitude loading is

   carbon dioxide were irradiated by 200 keV He+ ions. We found that the
   CO2/H2O ratio progressively decreased to a value of about 0.1, the H2O2
   production increased with increasing CO2 abundance at both 16 and 80 K,
   and the CO and H2CO3 production increased with increasing CO2 abundance
   at 16 K. At 80 K, the synthesis of CO was less efficient because of the
   high volatility of the molecule that partially sublimed from the target.
   The production of carbonic acid was connected with the production Of
   CO3. O-3 was detected only after ion irradiation Of CO2-rich mixtures.
   The experimental results are discussed with regard to the relevance they
   may have in the production of an energy source for a europan or a

Abstract = {{Purpose: Contrast enhanced sonography using phase-inversion harmonic
   mode is a promising technique to detect and characterize hepatic
   lesions. Aim of the following study was to evaluate whether this
   technique can characterize liver tumors.
   Material and Methods: During January and December 2004, 46 patients with
   a solitary liver lesion were examined. The age of the 21 women and 25
   men ranged between 37 and 82 years. The tumor size was between 8 mm and
   14.5 cm. First conventional B-mode sonography and color-coded sonography
   were performed, followed by intravenous injection of the contrast agent
   SonoVue and continuous sonographic examination over 5 minutes using
   ``low MI real-time{''} phase-inversion mode. The examination was video
   taped. The enhancement was evaluated qualitatively.
   Results: Of the 21 malignant lesions, 20 could be correctly diagnosed as
   malignant. One of the malignant lesions was classified as benign. Of the
   25 benign lesions, 21 could be classified correctly as benign, however,
   4 lesions (2 hemangiomas, 1 adenoma, 1 teratoma) showed no enhancement
   in the portal and late phase and were incorrectly classified as
   malignant as well.
   Conclusion: Using pulse-inversion harmonic US with SonoVue, liver
   lesions showing an isoechoic or hyperechoic enhancement can be
   classified as probably benign. Further work up is necessary in case of
   little or no enhancement on delayed phase imaging.}},

Abstract = {{P2X receptors mediate the effects of ATP in micturition and nociception.
   During postnatal maturation, a spinobulbospinal reflex and voluntary
   voiding replace primitive voiding reflexes. This may involve changes in
   neuroactive compounds and receptors in bladder reflex pathways. We
   examined P2X2 and P2X3 receptors in bladder and spinal cord from
   postnatal (P0-P36, indicating number of days) and adult Wistar rats.
   Western blot of whole bladders for P2X2 and P2X3 expression was
   performed. Immunostaining for P2X2 and P2X3 receptors in urothelium and
   detrusor smooth muscle whole mounts and spinal cord sections was
   examined. Western blot demonstrated an age-dependent decrease (R-2 =
   0.96, P <= 0.005) in P2X2 receptor expression in bladder, whereas P2X3
   receptor expression in bladder peaked (P <= 0.005) during P14-P21.
   P2X2-immunoreactivity (IR) was present in urothelial cells,
   suburothelial plexus, detrusor smooth muscle, and serosa at birth, with
   staining in urothelial cells and serosa being most predominant. With
   increasing postnatal age, the intensity of P2X2-IR decreased in
   urothelial cells but increased in suburothelial plexus. P2X3-IR
   increased in urothelial cells and suburothelial plexus with postnatal
   age, whereas staining in detrusor and serosa remained relatively
   constant. At birth, P2X3-IR was present in the dorsal horn, lateral
   collateral pathway, and dorsal commissure. With increasing age, P2X3-IR
   was restricted to superficial dorsal horn and lateral collateral
   pathway. P2X2-IR was present in ependyme cells (S-100-IR) of the central
   canal as early as P2. These studies demonstrate plastic expression of
   P2X2 and P2X3 receptors in bladder and spinal cord during early
   postnatal development at times coincident with appearance of mature
   voiding patterns.}},

Abstract = {{A muscle thermal rigorometer was constructed, allowing muscle
   shortenings induced by dynamic heating or isothermal aging to be
   monitored. Operating isothermally like a traditional rigorometer at 10
   degrees C, postmortem dorsal muscle shortening (S-10 degrees c)
   developing from 0\% to 10\% of its initial length in corresponding to
   RIfiber along fiber-direction developing from 0\% to 100\% within 16 h
   was monitored for freshwater tilapia. Monitoring meat cooking in the
   dynamic heating mode, heat-induced shortenings could be observed for all
   muscle samples possessing different degrees of rigor induced by 10 C
   aging. The heat-induced shortening (S-dynamic) plus its 10 degrees C
   aging shortening (S-10 degrees c) for each sample was the same,
   S-overall = S-10 degrees c + S-dynamic =10 degrees C. Their heat-induced
   shortening peak temperatures (Ts) from 30 degrees C to 48 degrees C were
   inversely correlated with the sample RIfiber from 0\% to near 100\%.
   These findings together with an additional calcium/adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP) model studies showed that the ATPase related
   myofibrillar contractile system was responsible for these
   low-temperature cooking shortenings, which along with Ts values could
   thus be adopted as new rigor indices.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed female body mass change, corrected by tarsus length (body
   condition) in tawny pipits Anthus campestris during the nesting period
   in a population subject to high nest predation rates (between 70 and
   85\%), which leads to the need for replacement clutches. Decrease in
   female body condition over the nesting stage (6.8 g, around 27\% of the
   initial mass during the whole nesting process) was related to laying
   date, clutch size and nesting period (incubation and nestling phases).
   Data from recaptured females indicated a decrease during each of the
   three nesting phases considered (the last days of incubation and first
   and last days of the nestling phase), with body mass always being higher
   in the first of the two measurements taken in each of these phases. The
   observation of a continuous decrease in body condition during the last
   days of incubation and first and last days of the nestling phase does
   not support the programmed anorexia hypothesis, but adjusts well to
   predictions of the stress hypothesis. These results suggest that the
   costs accumulated during the entire nesting stage in ground passerines
   subjected to high nest predation rates are linked to a superimposed
   effect of the cost of replacement clutches.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{863-869}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose : The purpose of this study was to examine the intrinsic
   susceptibility of cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCEC) to
   herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection. We compared HSV-1 adsorption,
   kinetics of HSV-1 production, and pattern of viral plaque formation in
   cultured HCEC with those of a cell line used routinely for laboratory
   HSV propagation (African green monkey kidney fibroblast CV-1 cells).
   Methods : Cultured HCEC and CV-1 cells were exposed to the McKrae strain
   of HSV-1 at 5 and 0.0001 multiplicities of infection (MOI). Using the
   50\% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) titration method, viral
   adsorption (at 5 MOI) and total virus production (at 5 and 0.0001 MOI)
   were compared to assess both susceptibility to viral attachment and
   productive viral infection, respectively. Additionally, visual
   observations were made at 0.0001 MOI using bright-field microscopy and
   immunofluorescence staining of viral antigens to compare patterns of
   viral spread in confluent monolayers of both cell types. Results : The
   percentage of HSV-1 virion particles adsorbed by cultured HCEC and CV-1
   cells was similar (35.9\% and 33.0\%, respectively, p = 0.07, NS),
   indicating similar susceptibility of the two cell types to initial HSV-1
   attachment and adsorption. However, maximum total virus production was
   more than 3-fold higher for HCEC than for CV-1 cells (p < 0.005),
   suggesting higher susceptibility of HCEC cells to productive viral
   infection. Immunofluorescence studies of infected cell monolayers
   corroborated these quantitative findings, with HCEC monolayers
   demonstrating more rapid progression of cytopathic effect than CV-1
   monolayers. Conclusions: In comparison to reference CV-1 cells, cultured
   HCEC show similar susceptibility to HSV-1 adsorption, but higher
   capacity to support productive HSV-1 infection. Our results suggest that
   human corneal endothelial cells may be inherently susceptible to HSV-1
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{Data from mutant analysis in yeast and Dictyostelium indicate a role for
   the cyclase-associated protein (CAP) in endocytosis and vesicle
   transport. We have used genetic and biochemical approaches to identify
   novel interacting partners of Dictyostelium CAP to help explain its
   molecular interactions in these processes. Cyclase-associated protein
   associates and interacts with subunits of the highly conserved vacuolar
   H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) and co-localizes to some extent with the V-ATPase.
   Furthermore, CAP is essential for maintaining the structural
   organization, integrity and functioning of the endo-lysosomal system, as
   distribution and morphology of V-ATPase- and Nramp1-decorated membranes
   were disturbed in a CAP mutant (CAP bsr) accompanied by an increased
   endosomal pH. Moreover, concanamycin A (CMA), a specific inhibitor of
   the V-ATPase, had a more severe effect on CAP bsr than on wild-type
   cells, and the mutant did not show adaptation to the drug. Also, the
   distribution of green fluorescent protein-CAP was affected upon CMA
   treatment in the wildtype and recovered after adaptation. Distribution
   of the V-ATPase in CAP bsr was drastically altered upon hypo-osmotic
   shock, and growth was slower and reached lower saturation densities in
   the mutant under hyper-osmotic conditions. Taken together, our data
   unravel a link of CAP with the actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis and
   suggest that CAP is an essential component of the endo-lysosomal system
   in Dictyostelium.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to pesticides is implicated in the etiopathogenesis of
   Parkinson's disease (PD). The organochlorine pesticide dieldrin is one
   of the environmental chemicals potentially linked to PD. Because recent
   evidence indicates that abnormal accumulation and aggregation of
   alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction can
   contribute to the degenerative processes of PD, in the present study we
   examined whether the environmental pesticide dieldrin impairs
   proteasomal function and subsequently promotes apoptotic cell death in
   rat mesencephalic dopaminergic neuronal cells overexpressing human
   alpha-synuclein. Overexpression of wild-type alpha-synuclein
   significantly reduced the proteasomal activity. Dieldrin exposure
   dose-dependently (0-70 mu M) decreased proteasomal activity, and 30 mu M
   dieldrin inhibited activity by more than 60\% in alpha-synuclein cells.
   Confocal microscopic analysis of dieldrin-treated alpha-synuclein cells
   revealed that alpha-synuclein-positive protein aggregates colocalized
   with ubiquitin protein. Further characterization of the aggregates with
   the autophagosomal marker mondansyl cadaverine and the lysosomal marker
   and dot-blot analysis revealed that these protein oligomeric aggregates
   were distinct from autophagosomes and lysosomes. The dieldrin-induced
   proteasomal dysfunction in alpha-synuclein cells was also confirmed by
   significant accumulation of ubiquitin protein conjugates in the
   detergent-insoluble fraction. We found that proteasomal inhibition
   preceded cell death after dieldrin treatment and that alpha-synuclein
   cells were more sensitive than vector cells to the toxicity.
   Furthermore, measurement of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation confirmed
   the enhanced sensitivity of alpha-synuclein cells to dieldrin-induced
   apoptosis. Together, our results suggest that increased expression of
   alpha-synuclein predisposes dopaminergic cells to proteasomal
   dysfunction, which can be further exacerbated by environmental exposure
   to certain neurotoxic compounds, such as dieldrin.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of the stomatal apparatus of the leaf of Lycopodium
   japonicum Thumb was studied using epidermal macerations, sections and
   scanning electron. microscopy. The stomatal apparatus of L. japonicum
   consists of two large guard cells and pore, and is anomocytic. Based on
   light microscopy, the impression from epidermal macerations that there
   were two small guard cells surrounded by two, large, similarly shaped,
   subsidiary cells (paracytic) derives from a pronounced elliptical
   cuticular ledge on the surface of the guard cells surrounding a
   thickened circumporal area. A similar appearance is characteristic of
   cuticle preparations of the Devonian lycophyte Drepanophycus
   spinaeformis Goppert. We therefore conclude, as did W.H. Lang over 70
   years ago, that the stomata of the early lycophyte were also anomocytic,
   as were those of a second species of Drepanophycus,D. qujingensis Li \&
   Edwards. (c) 2005 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research was to determine whether or not feeding
   induced hypovolemia (decreases in plasma volume) and decreases in plasma
   bicarbonate concentration caused by loss of NaHCO3 from the blood, act
   to suppress feed intake and saliva secretion volumes during the initial
   stages of feeding in goats fed on dry forage. The animals were fed twice
   a day at 10:30 and at 16:00 for 2 h each time. Prior to the morning
   feeding, the collected saliva (3-5 kg) was infused into the rumen.
   During the morning 2 h feeding period (10:30 to 12:30), the animals were
   fed 2-3 kg of roughly crushed alfalfa hay cubes. At 16:00, the animals
   were fed again with 0.8 kg of alfalfa hay cubes, 200 g of commercial
   ground concentrate and 20 g of sodium bicarbonate. In order to
   compensate for water or NaHCO3 lost through saliva during initial stages
   of feeding, a 3 h intravenous infusion (17-19 ml/min) of artificial
   mixed saliva (ASI) or mannitol solution (MI) was begun 1 h prior to the
   morning feeding and continued until the conclusion of the 2 h feeding
   period. The physiological state of the goats in the present experiment
   remained unchanged after parotid gland fistulation. Circulating plasma
   volume decreases caused by feeding (estimated by increases in plasma
   total protein concentration) were significantly suppressed by the ASI
   and MI treatments. During the first 1 h of the 2 h feeding period,
   plasma osmolality in the ASI treatment was the same as the NI
   (non-infusion control) treatment, while plasma osmolality in the MI
   treatment was significantly higher. In comparison to the NI treatment,
   cumulative feed intake levels for the duration of the 2 h feeding period
   in the ASI and MI treatments increased markedly by 56.6 and 88.3\%,
   respectively. On the other hand, unilateral cumulative parotid saliva
   secretion volume following the termination of the 2 h feeding period in
   the ASI treatment was 50.7\% higher than that in the NI treatment. MI
   treatment showed the same level as the NI treatment. The results of the
   present experiment proved that the humoral factors involved in the
   suppression of feeding and saliva secretion during the initial stages of
   feeding in goats fed on dry forage, are feeding induced hypovolemia and
   decrease in plasma HCO3- concentration caused by loss of NaHCO3 from the
   blood.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike the conventional method of obtaining the spatial impulse response
   (SIR) for a transducer from the time domain, we propose a new and
   computationally efficient approach for calculating the acoustic field
   for a rectangular focusing array transducer in a transmitting,
   receiving, or transmitting-receiving (pulse-echo) mode from the
   frequency domain. The SIR spectrum, corresponding to each single
   frequency, is derived by superposing the sound. fields generated by the
   subdivided rectangular sources. The time-domain pressure variation is
   obtained by taking the inverse Fourier transform from the combination of
   each SIR spectrum for the array. The results for a single rectangular
   transducer in transmitting and receiving modes match well with those
   from previous studies. The SIR spectrum for a focusing linear array
   transducer with multiple field scatterers is also developed. The
   proposed approach markedly reduces the number of sampling points,
   thereby substantially increasing the computation efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{As part of our studies towards molecularly targeted cancer therapy, we
   developed novel non-hydroxamate histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. A
   series of compounds modeled after suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)
   was designed as follows: (i) structure-based drug design; (ii) design
   applying the thiophilicity of zinc ion; (iii) design based on the
   structure of the transition state; (iv) design based on the enzyme
   catalysis mechanism; and (v) irreversible inhibition-oriented design. In
   this series, compound 7, in which the hydroxamic acid of SAHA is
   replaced by a thiol, was found to be as potent as SAHA, and optimization
   of this series led to HDAC inhibitors 43, 47, 52 and 53, which were more

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many pathophysiological processes in
   the brain. NO is synthesized from arginine by nitric oxide synthase
   (NOS) enzymes. Citrulline formed as a by-product of the NOS reaction,
   can be recycled to arginine by successive actions of argininosuccinate
   synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) via the citrulline-NO
   cycle. Hyperammonemia is known to cause poorly understood perturbations
   of the citrulline-NO cycle. To understand the role of citrulline-NO
   cycle in hyperammonemia, NOS, ASS, ASL and arginase activities, as well
   as nitrate/nitrite (NOx), arginine, ornithine, citrulline, glutamine,
   gluamate and GABA were estimated in cerebral cortex (CC), cerebellum
   (CB) and brain stem (BS) of rats subjected to acute ammonia toxicity.
   NOx concentration and NOS activity were found to increase in all the
   regions of brain in acute ammonia toxicity. The activities of ASS and
   ASL showed an increasing trend whereas the arginase was not changed. The
   results of this study clearly demonstrated the increased formation of
   NO, suggesting the involvement of NO in the pathophysiology of acute
   ammonia toxicity. The increased activities of ASS and ASL suggest the
   increased and effective recycling of citrulline to arginine in acute
   ammonia toxicity, making NO production more effective and contributing
   to its toxic effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan

   temptation to choose defection. In the zero temperature limit the

Abstract = {{The time-dependent Schrodinger equation for an electron passing through
   a semiconductor quantum ring of nonzero width is solved in the presence
   of a perpendicular homogeneous magnetic field. We study the effects of
   the Lorentz force on the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations. Within the range of
   incident momentum for which the ring is transparent at zero magnetic
   field, the Lorentz force leads to a decrease of the oscillation
   amplitude, due to the asymmetry in the electron injection in the two
   arms of the ring. For structures in which the fast electrons are
   predominantly backscattered, the Lorentz force assists in the transport,
   producing an initial increase of the corresponding oscillation
   amplitude. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of elastic scattering on a
   potential cavity within one of the arms of the ring. For the cavity
   tuned to shift maximally the phase of the maximum of the wave packet we
   observe a pi shift of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations. For other cavity
   depths oscillations with a period of half of the flux quantum are
   observed.}},

Abstract = {{Constrained optimization problems are very important and frequently
   appear in the real world. The alpha constrained method is a new
   transformation method for constrained optimization. In this method, a
   satisfaction level for the constraints is introduced, which indicates
   how well a search point satisfies the constraints. The alpha level
   comparison, which compares search points based on their level of
   satisfaction of the constraints, is also introduced. The alpha
   constrained method can convert an algorithm for unconstrained problems
   into an algorithm for constrained problems by replacing ordinary
   comparisons with the alpha level comparisons. In this paper, we
   introduce some improvements including mutations to the nonlinear simplex
   method to search around the boundary of the feasible region and to
   control the convergence speed of the method, we apply the alpha
   constrained method and we propose the improved alpha constrained simplex
   method for constrained optimization problems. The effectiveness of the
   alpha constrained simplex method is shown by comparing its performance
   with that of the stochastic ranking method on various constrained

   promote DNA replication of the phage. Although its role in the DNA
   replication is not clear, gp1 is reported to exhibit multiple
   characteristics, including RNA binding, cell membrane localization, and
   self-association. To investigate these characteristics, we undertook the
   isolation of a series of missense mutants of gene 1 bearing
   substitutions at various regions. During cloning of gene 1, we found
   that its expression severely inhibited the growth of its host
   Escherichia coli cells. In this study, we utilized this
   growth-inhibition phenomenon to screen a random library mutagenized by
   error-prone PCR, expecting that mutants which could not inhibit cell
   growth would be affected in the authentic functions of gp1. Using this
   approach, we obtained 31 different mutants bearing single amino acid
   substitutions at 26 positions along the entire length of gp1. As a
   preliminary analysis of these mutants, we compared the deduced amino
   acid sequences of gp1s from 029 and its related phages PZA, B103 and M2.
   Alignment of these sequences revealed three conserved regions, i.e. a
   hydrophobic region near the carboxyl terminus (assumed to be involved in
   the membrane localization and self-association of gp1), coiled-coil
   motif (essential for self-association), and a region of unknown function
   near the amino terminus. Interestingly, many of the substitutions in the
   isolated mutants occurred at strongly conserved residues in these
   regions and affected characteristic features of the regions (e.g.
   hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic region). These substitutions are
   expected to affect authentic functions of gp1, and the mutants will be
   useful for studies of the structure and functions of gp1.}},

Abstract = {{During long-term storage, Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) seeds are
   susceptible to ageing, leading to declined vigour and poor
   germinability. To characterize biochemical changes associated with this
   ageing, vitamin E and fatty acid compositions of Scots pine seeds stored
   for 3-31 years were analysed. The seeds contained seven homologues of
   the vitamin E family: alpha-, beta-, delta- and gamma-tocopherols (T)
   and alpha-, delta- and gamma-tocotrienol (T3). The major tocopherol was
   gamma-T, constituting on average 62.1\% of total vitamin E. Total
   vitamin E concentration was markedly lower in older seeds, e. g.
   21-year-old seeds contained 52\% less vitamin E than the reference for
   high-quality seed. The a- T concentration was affected the most by seed
   age, whereas the gamma-T concentration decreased more gradually and the
   concentrations of the other E vitamers seemed to remain relatively
   constant during natural ageing. Ageing also induced changes in the fatty
   acid composition of the seeds, e. g. a 29.6\% reduction in the
   unsaturation/saturation ratio. These biochemical changes were associated
   with decreased germinability and increased electrolyte leakage.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy were explored to
   investigate the movement and localization of mineral oils in citrus. In
   a laboratory experiment, fluorescence microscopy observation indicated
   that when a `narrow' distillation fraction of an nC23 horticultural
   mineral oil was applied to adaxial and opposing abaxial leaf surfaces of
   potted orange {[}Citrus x aurantium L. (Sapindales: Rutaceae)] trees,
   oil penetrated steadily into treated leaves and, subsequently, moved to
   untreated petioles of the leaves and adjacent untreated stems. In
   another experiment, confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to
   visualize the penetration into, and the subsequent cellular distribution
   of, an nC24 agricultural mineral oil in C. trifoliata L. seedlings. Oil
   droplets penetrated or diffused into plants via both stomata and the
   cuticle of leaves and stems, and then moved within intercellular spaces
   and into various cells including phloem and xylem. Oil accumulated in
   droplets in intercellular spaces and within cells near the cell
   membrane. Oil entered cells without visibly damaging membranes or
   causing cell death. In a field experiment with mature orange trees,
   droplets of an nC23 horticultural mineral oil were observed, by
   fluorescence microscopy, in phloem sieve elements in spring flush growth
   produced 4-5 months and 16-17 months after the trees were sprayed with
   oil. These results suggest that movement of mineral oil in plants is
   both apoplastic via intercellular spaces and symplastic via
   plasmodesmata. The putative pattern of the translocation of mineral oil
   in plants and its relevance to oil-induced chronic phytotoxicity are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A role for type 11 interferon (IFN-gamma) in resolving viral infection
   is suggested by the correlation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance
   with enhancement of IFN-gamma-producing activated T cells in the
   resolution of acute HCV infection. Using vesicular stomatitis virus
   (VSV), a synergistic direct antiviral effect was documented using
   IFN-gamma 1b and a potent, consensus type I IFN (IFN alfacon-1). Global
   expression profiling following EC50 exposure to IFN alfacon-1, IFN-gamma
   1b, or a cocktail of the two allowed the antiviral state to be
   correlated with induction of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).
   Genes identified through this analysis corresponded to classic antiviral
   components, ISGs more recently associated with direct antiviral
   functions, as well as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and hypothetical
   proteins. The magnitude of these antiviral EC50-correlated expression
   events in human hepatoma (Huh7) cells exposed to clinically relevant
   doses of IFN alfacon-1, IFN-gamma 1b, or a cocktail of the two was also
   probed because the standard of care for patients with chronic hepatitis
   C is type I IFN-containing regimens. Relative to type I IFNs used alone,
   the addition of type 11 IFN caused enhanced expression not only of many
   of the genes correlated with the direct antiviral state but also of
   genes involved in (1) antigen presentation to cytotoxic T lymphocytes
   (CTLs), (2) macrophage, natural killer (NK), and T helper 1 (Th1) cell
   recruitment and activation, (3) complement system function, (4)
   apoptosis, and (5) ISGs with unknown functions. As many of these
   processes are correlated clinically with resolution of chronic HCV
   infection, the combined use of these IFNs could display a beneficial
   effect on viral clearance in patients infected with HCV and other
   viruses through enhancement of one of these processes or of the direct
   antiviral state.}},

Abstract = {{Intractable epilepsy is commonly believed to be the main cause of
   uncontrolled seizures and hospitalization in epileptic patients. We
   study frequency and types of potential provocative factors in epileptic
   patients admitted with seizures, and suggest methods to decrease seizure
   occurrence and hospitalization. Over 6 months we prospectively studied
   all epileptic patients hospitalized for seizures. A structured interview
   and laboratory investigations were used to determine type and number of
   potential seizure precipitants. Precipitants thought to be avoidable
   through actions taken by the patient or physicians were termed
   potentially preventable provocative factors (PPPF). Patients' awareness
   and knowledge of seizure precipitants were also assessed. Three quarters
   of all seizures leading to admission were associated with PPPF, the
   commonest being non-compliance (71\%), sub-therapeutic doses of
   antiepileptic drugs (26\%) and steep deprivation (9\%). Only one patient
   had intractable epilepsy. Patients' knowledge of seizure precipitants
   was poor. The majority of hospital admissions for seizures in epileptic
   patients are associated with potentially preventable causes amenable to
   education programmes. Patient education involving epilepsy nurse
   educators may play an important rote in decreasing seizure occurrence
   and possibly unnecessary hospital admissions. circle dot 2005 BEA

Abstract = {{The O-15(alpha,gamma)Ne-19 reaction is one of the most important
   breakout reactions for the hot CNO cycles. However, the relevant states
   in Ne-19 at excitation energies of 4-5 MeV have not been well studied.
   The lifetimes of these states are not known and are only constrained by
   experimental upper and lower limits. In particular, accurate knowledge
   of the gamma- and alpha-decay widths of the 4.03-MeV state of Ne-19 is
   important, since the resonance strength of this level dominates the
   reaction rate for the astrophysically relevant temperatures T-9 < 0.6.
   In this work, we employed an improved Doppler-shifted attenuation method
   to obtain lifetime values of this and other states via O-17(He-3,
   n-gamma)Ne-19. For the 4.03-MeV state, the measured excitation energy is
   4034.5 +/- 0.8 keV and the mean lifetime, measured here for the first
   time, is 13(-6)(+9) fs at the confidence level of 1 sigma and
   13(-9)(+16) fs at the confidence level of 2 sigma. This result is in
   excellent agreement with the 9-fs prediction by Langanke, Wiescher,

Abstract = {{Bundles of F-actin and DNA present in the sputum of cystic fibrosis (CF)
   patients but absent from normal airway fluid contribute to the altered
   viscoelastic properties of sputum that inhibit clearance of infected
   airway fluid and exacerbate the pathology of CF. Previous strategies to
   remove these filamentous aggregates have focused on DNase to
   enzymatically depolymerize DNA to constituent monomers and gelsolin to
   sever F-actin to small fragments. The high densities of negative surface
   charge on DNA and F-actin suggest that the bundles of these filaments,
   which alone exhibit a strong electrostatic repulsion, may be stabilized
   by multivalent cations such as histones, antimicrobial peptides, and
   other positively charged molecules prevalent in airway fluid. This study
   reports that bundles of DNA or F-actin formed after addition of histone
   H1 or lysozyme are efficiently dissolved by soluble multivalent anions
   such as polymeric aspartate or glutamate. Addition of poly-aspartate or
   poly-glutamate also disperses DNA and actin-containing bundles in CF
   sputum and lowers the elastic moduli of these samples to levels
   comparable to those obtained after treatment with DNase I or gelsolin.
   Addition of poly-aspartic acid also increased DNase activity when added
   to samples containing DNA bundles formed with histone H1. When added to
   CF sputum, polyaspartic acid significantly reduced the growth of
   bacteria, suggesting activation of endogenous antibacterial factors.
   These findings suggest that soluble multivalent anions have potential
   alone or in combination with other mucolytic agents to selectively
   dissociate the large bundles of charged biopolymers that form in CF
   sputum.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Although lamivudine is effective for treatment of chronic
   hepatitis B (HBV) infection, its potential therapeutic impact on
   HBV-related membranous nephropathy (MN) in adults has not been
   characterized.
   Methods. We treated 10 HBsAg-positive patients with biopsy-proven MN,
   elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and HBV-DNAemia (group
   1), and compared their clinical course with 12 patients diagnosed to
   have HBV infection, elevated serum ALT, and MN in the pre-lamivudine era
   (group 2).
   Results. Baseline demographic and clinical parameters were not different
   between the 2 groups. In group 1, lamivudine treatment was associated
   with significant reduction in proteinuria, increase in serum albumin,
   normalization of ALT levels, and disappearance of circulating HBV-DNA
   during the first year. Four (40\%) and 6 (60\%) patients went into
   complete remission (proteinuria < 0.3 g/d) at 6 and 12 months,
   respectively. In group 2, significant proteinuria persisted during the
   first year. One (8.3\%) and 3 (25\%) patients went into remission.
   Cumulative 3-year renal survival {[}using end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
   as primary end point] was 100\% in group 1 and 58\% in group 2 (P=
   0.024, log rank test). Blood pressure control reached the target of
   below 130/85 mm Hg in both groups. Lamivudine was well tolerated and not
   associated with any adverse events. Hepatic decompensation or malignancy
   was not observed during follow-up in both groups.
   Conclusion. HBV-related MN leads to ESRD in a significant proportion of
   patients before the advent of antiviral therapy. Lamivudine treatment
   improves renal outcome in HBV carriers with MN and evidence of liver
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis imaging has become increasingly important in the
   understanding of the natural history of coronary artery disease and the
   processes leading to luminal narrowing, as well as in the assessment of
   disease burden and therapy efficacy. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has
   emerged as the new gold standard for atherosclerosis imaging because it
   provides cross-sectional images of both the arterial wall and lumen with
   excellent resolution, reveals the diffuse nature of atherosclerosis and
   the involvement of reference segments, and takes into account vessel
   wall remodelling. In addition to its clinical indications, IVUS is now
   widely used as the primary efficacy assessment measure of several
   antiatherosclerotic approaches in randomized clinical trials. The
   advantages of using IVUS include its ability to reveal
   antiatherosclerotic effects within a relatively short period of time and
   with a reasonable sample size, in contrast to trials assessing
   angiographic changes or clinical events. IVUS can also help to determine
   dose-response relationships in the development of novel pharmacological
   agents. IVUS is currently the ideal imaging modality for clinical trials
   examining the progression or regression of atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is efficiently treated with a cell
   differentiation inducer, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). However, a
   significant percentage of patients still develop resistance to this
   treatment. Recently, arsenic trioxide (As2O3), alone or in combination
   with ATRA, has been identified as an alternative therapy in patients
   with both ATRA-sensitive and ATRA-resistant APL. Previous investigations
   restricted the mechanism of this synergism to the modulation and/or
   degradation of PML-RAR alpha oncoprotein through distinct pathways. In
   this study, using several ATRA maturation-resistant APL cell lines, we
   demonstrate in vitro that the success of ATRA/As2O3 treatment in APL
   pathology can be explained, at least in part, by a synergistic effect of
   these two drugs in triggering downregulation of telomerase efficient
   enough to cause telomere shortening and subsequent cell death. Such
   long-term low-dose combinatorial therapy strategies, developed also to
   avoid acute side effects, reinforce the notion that the antitelomerase
   strategy, based on a combination of active agents, should now be
   considered and evaluated not only in APL but also in other malignancies.}},

Abstract = {{Progress on a well-defined project can be described along a task
   dimension in terms of amount done, or as amount of work still to be

   reported showing that such frames have predictable implications for
   speakers as well as for listeners: Statements by a team leader about
   time spent and work left are perceived as suggestions to ``hurry up,{''}
   whereas complementary statements about work done and time left indicate
   that the team can take it more easy. The first set of statements further
   implies that the team is behind schedule, whereas the last two
   statements suggest that the team is ahead of the plan. In line with
   this, speakers preferred work done and time left statements when they
   were ahead of schedule, but not when they were behind. ``Hurry up{''}
   and ``behind schedule{''} interpretations were also shown to be
   dependent upon stage, being more prominent in the final stages than
   during the initial stages of a project. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{In today's time-based competition, the unit cost of a high-tech product
   declines significantly over its short product life cycle. Consequently,
   in this paper, we relax the traditional economic production quantity
   model to allow for time-varying cost. We then prove that the optimal
   production schedule uniquely exists. In addition, we also show that the
   total cost is a convex function of the number of replenishments, which
   reduces the search for the optimal solution to finding a local minimum.
   Furthermore, we characterize the influences of both demand and cost over
   the length of production run time and the economic production quantity.

Abstract = {{Yersinia enterocolitica is an enteric pathogen that consists of six
   biotypes: 1A, 1B, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Strains of the latter five biotypes
   can carry a virulence plasmid, known as pYV, and several
   well-characterized chromosomally encoded virulence determinants. Y.
   enterocolitica strains of biotype 1A lack the virulence-associated
   markers of pYV-bearing strains and were once considered to be avirulent.
   There is growing epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence,
   however, to suggest that some biotype 1A strains are virulent and can
   cause gastrointestinal disease. To identify potential virulence genes of
   pathogenic strains of Y. enterocolitica biotype 1A, we used genomic
   subtractive hybridization to determine genetic differences between two
   biotype 1A strains: an environmental isolate, Y. enterocolitica IP2222,
   and a clinical isolate, Y. enterocolitica T83. Among the Y.
   enterocolitica T83-specific genes we identified were three, tcbA, tcaC,
   and tccC, that showed homology to the insecticidal toxin complex (TC)
   genes first discovered in Photorhabdus luminescens. The Y.
   enterocolitica T83 TC gene homologues were expressed by Y.
   enterocolitica T83 and were significantly more prevalent among clinical
   biotype 1A strains than other Yersinia isolates. Inactivation of the TC
   genes in Y. enterocolitica T83 resulted in mutants which were attenuated
   in the ability to colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of perorally
   infected mice. These results indicate that products of the TC gene
   complex contribute to the virulence of some strains of Y. enterocolitica
   biotype 1A, possibly by facilitating their persistence in vivo.}},

Title = {{Acquisition of fluorescence and reflectance spectra during routine
   bronchoscopy examinations using the ClearVu Elite (TM) device: Pilot
   study}},
Journal = {{LUNG CANCER}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-42}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Fluorescence flexible bronchoscopy (FFB) has proved to be very
   useful for detecting carcinoma in situ (CIS) and pre-cancerous lesions
   of the lung that are generally occult to white light reflectance
   bronchoscopy (WLRB). However, the increased sensitivity has caused a
   significant decrease of specificity, resulting in a large number of
   false positive signals that lead to a significant number of unnecessary
   biopsies. We have been planning to test a hypothesis that reflectance
   spectra and fluorescence spectra could be used to distinguish the true
   positive lesions from the false positive ones. To property test such
   hypothesis, several thousand patients will need to be examined to obtain
   sufficient data from different lung lesions. Towards this goal, we have
   developed and have been testing a special system (ClearVu Etite (TM))
   that facilitates acquisition of both WLRB and FFB spectra during routine
   bronchoscopy examinations. In this pilot study we examined (1) if such
   could be used in a practical, routine clinical conditions without
   affecting commonly used bronchoscopy procedures; (2) if the spectral.
   data obtained from the images are identical to those obtained with
   fiber-optic probes; and (3) if the few malignant and early neoplastic
   lesions available for this pilot study show any differences from normal
   lung tissue.
   Methods: The study population consisted of 63 patients that were
   suspicious for presence of lung cancer (19 female and 44 male, smokers
   and non-smokers). All were examined by diagnostic bronchoscopy using
   ClearVu Elite (TM) during a period of 8 weeks.
   Results and Conclusions: The experimental system provides excellent real
   time WLRB and FFB that can be switched from one to another mode
   instantaneously. Acquisition of both white light reflectance spectra and
   fluorescence spectra is acquired in real time through the images and
   does not prolong the routine WLRB and FFB procedures. The experimental
   bronchoscopy procedure is as simple as conventional bronchoscopy, adding
   on average less than 5 min to the 20 min procedure. The acquired spectra
   are identical to those obtained by fiber-optic probes. In all of the
   Limited number of malignant and early neoplastic lesions, there were
   differences found which are sufficiently pronounced to warrant
   initiation of a large, multicenter study for development of
   differentiating algorithms of statistical validity. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Aims To systematically assess the risk/benefit ratio of a rate-control
   strategy vs. a rhythm-control strategy in patients with first or
   recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF).
   Methods and results We searched Medline, CENTRAL, and other sources up
   to September 2004 for randomized trials. Individual and pooled
   random-effect odd ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) {[}OR
   (95\% CI)] were calculated for the combined endpoint of all cause death
   and thromboembolic stroke (CEP), major bleeds (intra and extracranial),
   and systemic embolism. Number needed to treat (NNT) to avoid one CEP and
   heterogeneity were also assessed. Five studies enrolling 5239 patients
   with AF compared rate-control vs. rhythm-control. Average follow-up
   ranged from 1 to 3.5 years. A rate-control strategy compared with a
   rhythm-control approach was associated with a significantly reduced risk
   of CEP {[}OR 0.84 (0.73, 0.98), P=0.02], and with a trend towards a
   reduced risk of death {[}OR 0.87 (0.74, 1.02), P=0.09] and
   thromboembolic stroke {[}OR 0.80 (0.6, 1.07), P=0.14]. NNT to save one
   CEP was 50. There was no significant difference in the risk of major
   bleeds {[}OR 1.14 (0.9, 1.45), P=0.28] and systemic embolism {[}OR 0.93
   (0.43, 2.02), P=0.90]. No significant heterogeneity was found in any of
   the analyses (P > 0.1).
   Conclusion This meta-analysis of 5239 patients with AF indicates that an
   initial rate-control strategy compared with a rhythm-control one is
   associated with a better prognosis, thus representing the standard
   treatment against which to test new therapeutic approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Renal artery stenosis is a common problem, particularly for patients
   with other manifestations of atherosclerosis. Wide practice variations
   are apparent regarding how best to manage this disorder. Part of this
   variation is based on a broad range of clinical presentation, from
   incidentally identified disease of no clinical importance to rapidly
   progressive hypertension, renal failure, and refractory congestive heart
   failure. Advances in anti hypertensive therapy, particularly as a result
   of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin receptor
   blockade, have led to improved blood pressure control and delayed
   recognition of renal artery disease. As a result, patients now sent for
   revascularization are older than before and have high comorbid disease
   risk, primarily related to cardiovascular events. Clinicians need to be
   vigilant for evidence of unsuspected renal artery stenosis as a cause of
   treatment-resistant hypertension and/or renal failure. Renal
   revascularization should be considered in viable individuals before the
   development of advanced renal insufficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the number of intraocular foreign body (IOFB)
   injuries that occurred in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and to determine the
   cause of injury, the type of foreign body, and the associated injuries
   to other body systems.
   Design: Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.
   Participants: Fifty-five United States military personnel with an IOFB
   injury during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
   Intervention: Pars plana vitrectomy, foreign body removal, and
   additional surgical procedures as the clinical situation dictated.
   Main Outcome Measures: Cause of injury, size of corneal/scleral
   laceration, number of foreign bodies, type of foreign body, time to
   foreign body removal, visual acuity, number of enucleations, and
   injuries to other body systems.
   Results: The foreign body was caused by a propelled explosive in 20
   patients (36\%) and a nonpropelled explosive in 31 patients (56\%), and
   the cause of the foreign body was not known in 4 patients (7\%). The
   size of the laceration of the cornea and/or sclera averaged 5.4 mm
   (range, 0.2-18). There were an average of 1.7 foreign bodies in the
   injured eye (range, 1-6). The size of those foreign bodies measured
   ranged from <1 mm to 12 X 14 mm. The most common type of foreign body
   was metal (68\%), followed by glass (14\%), stone/cement (14\%), bone
   (5\%), and cilia (3\%). The time from injury to foreign body removal
   averaged 20.6 days (range, 0-90). No cases of endophthalmitis were seen.
   The most common associated injury was to the upper extremity, face,
   lower extremity, and neck.
   Conclusions: Unlike trauma in the civilian sector, IOFB injuries in a
   military setting tend to be caused by explosive devices, which often
   result in multiple foreign bodies and simultaneous injuries to other
   body systems. Because of the lack of availability of specialty care in
   the combat theater, there is often a delay in removal of the foreign
   body. (c) 2005 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.}},

   Methods: For the leading causes of disease, injury, and disability,
   evidence was systematically reviewed for modifiable risk factors and
   their attributable fractions, and for public health interventions and
   their preventable fractions.
   Results: For 31 conditions, 194 modifiable risk factors were identified,
   and attributable fractions were found for 65 (33.5\%). For 137 (70.6\%)
   of the risk factors, 702 population-based interventions were found.
   Preventable fractions were found for 31 (4.4\%) of the interventions.
   Conclusions: Despite considerable information about both modifiable risk
   factors and interventions designed to reduce the risks of the major
   causes of disease, injury, and disability, the evidence base that
   describes the effectiveness of these interventions is limited. The CDC
   is committed to support research that will set priorities for program
   development and identify effective public health interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Frozen squid is susceptible to both lipid oxidation and yellow/brown
   discoloration during frozen storage. The involvement of lipid oxidation
   in the microsomal fraction of squid muscle on oxidative rancidity and
   discoloration was investigated using iron and either enzymatic or
   non-enzymatic redox cycling pathways. Lipid oxidation was measured by
   thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), and color changes were
   measured spectrophotometrically using an integrating sphere. The lipid
   oxidation was not observed in the squid microsomes in the presence of
   Fe(3+) and beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide disodium salt (NADH)
   or P-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced (NADPH),
   suggesting that the enzymatic redox cycling pathway was not active.
   Iron-promoted TBARS formation was observed in the non-enzymatic pathway
   when ascorbic acid was used as a reducing compound. Non-enzymatic lipid
   oxidation increased with increasing temperature (4 degrees C to 37
   degrees C), iron (0.1 to 100 mu M, and ascorbic acid (0 to 200 mu M
   concentrations. As lipid oxidation in the microsomes or isolated
   microsomal lipids increased; color changes were observed as could be
   seen by an increase in b({*}) values (yellowness) and a decrease in
   a({*}) (redness) values.' The ability of iron and ascorbate to promote
   both lipid oxidation and pigment formation in the microsomal fraction
   suggests that this pathway could be responsible for quality
   deterioration of squid muscle during storage.}},

Abstract = {{Injection of the hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-E) into partially fed
   (virgin) female adults of the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis,
   while they are attached and feeding on the rabbit host, initiated the
   expression of the vitellogenin (Vg) gene, and Vg protein secretion and
   uptake by the ovary. The induction of egg production by 20-E in this
   bioassay was dose dependent in the range of 1-50 times the concentration
   normally found in a replete, vitellogenic female. Ticks examined 4 d
   after the 50 x treatment were still attached to the host, had numerous
   enlarged vitellin-filled (brown) oocytes in their ovaries, but had not
   engorged to repletion. The ovaries reached weights similar to those
   found in untreated, replete (mated) females (pre-oviposition) while
   solvent-injected controls demonstrated no increase in oocyte size or
   increase in ovary weight. An increase in the levels of a putative Vg
   protein was observed in hemolymph samples collected 1, 2 and 3 d
   post-20-E injection but was not observed in the corresponding solvent
   controls as determined by native PAGE. Analysis of the
   ecdysteroid-induced protein by tryptic digestion-mass fingerprinting and
   BLASTP found that the putative Vg had the strongest match to GP80
   (U49934), the partial sequence for the vitellogenin protein from
   Boophilus microplus. A partial Vg cDNA was cloned and sequenced from
   replete females of D. variabilis with a high similarity to GP80. Using
   this message as a probe, Northern blots conducted with RNA collected
   from partially fed, virgin females 1, 2 and 3 d post-20-E injection
   showed upregulation of the Vg mRNA on all 3 days. Controls injected with
   solvent only showed no Vg mRNA. Injections with juvenile hormone III did
   not stimulate Vg expression, oocyte growth or full engorgement. These
   studies indicate that ecdysteroids and not JH can initiate expression of
   the Vg gene, Vg protein synthesis and release into hemolymph, and Vg
   uptake into developing oocytes under bioassay conditions mimicking
   normal feeding on the host. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To validate lymphatic mapping combined with sentinel lymph node
   biopsy as a staging procedure, and to evaluate the possible clinical
   implications of added oblique lymphoscintigraphy and/or tomography and
   test the intra- and interobserver reproducibility of lymphoscintigraphy.
   Material and Methods: Forty patients (17 F and 23 M, aged 32-90) with 24
   T I and 16 T2 squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Planar
   lymphoscintigraphy, emission and transmission tomography were performed.
   Detection and excision of the sentinel nodes were guided by a gamma
   probe. The sentinel nodes were step-sectioning and stained with
   hematoxylin and eosin and cytokeratin (CK 1). Histology and follow-up
   were used as ``gold standard{''}. Tumor location, number of sentinel
   lymph nodes, metastasis, and recurrences were registered. Two observers
   evaluated the lymphoscintigraphic images to assess the inter-rater
   agreement.
   Results: Eleven (28\%) patients were upstaged. The sentinel lymph node
   identification rate was 97.5\%. Sentinel lymph node biopsy significantly
   differentiated between patients with or without lymph node metastasis
   (P=0.001). Lymphatic mapping revealed 124 hotspots and 144 hot lymph
   nodes were removed by sentinel lymph node biopsy. Three patients
   developed a lymph node recurrence close to the primary tumor site during
   follow-up. Added oblique lymphoscintigraphic images and/or tomography
   revealed extra hotspots in 15/40 (38\%) patients. In 4/40 (10\%), extra
   contralateral hotspots were detected.
   Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy upstaged 28\% of the patients.
   Sentinel lymph nodes close to the primary tumor were difficult to find.
   Added oblique planar images and/or tomographic images revealed extra
   clinical relevant hotspots in 38\% of patients. Reproducibility proved
   excellent.}},

Abstract = {{Three major components of participatory decision-making, namely
   knowledge, communication and reporting, are reviewed. A prototype
   knowledge management system based on these components is developed in
   the context of community forestry. The system addresses key issues such

   the participating individuals and organizations, and is structured
   around a hierarchical structure of Principles, Criteria and Indicators
   (PC\&I). The system automates production of customized reports that can
   be prepared as hard copy documents, web pages or audio (narrated)
   reports on cassette and in a selected language. The reporting structure
   permits individuals to contribute material to interim reports and
   facilitates the tracking of their knowledge contribution to the decision
   process. These customized reports mitigate problems of information
   overload, as well as increasing the satisfaction of the recipients with
   the participatory process. The system is used as a basis for discussion
   of alternative system designs and issues related to interactions between

Abstract = {{Several observations are made concerning the numerical implementation of
   wide-angle one-way wave equations, using for illustration scalar waves
   obeying the Helmholtz equation in two space dimensions. This simple case
   permits clear identification of a sequence of physically motivated
   approximations of use when the mathematically exact pseudo-differential
   operator (PSDO) one-way method is applied. As intuition suggests, these
   approximations largely depend on the medium gradients in the direction
   transverse to the main propagation direction. A key point is that
   narrow-angle approximations are to be avoided in the interests of
   accuracy. Another key consideration stems from the fact that the
   so-called `standard-ordering' PSDO indicates how lateral interpolation
   of the velocity structure can significantly reduce computational costs
   associated with the Fourier or plane-wave synthesis lying at the heart
   of the calculations. A third important point is that the PSDO theory
   shows what approximations are necessary in order to generate an
   exponential one-way propagator for the laterally varying case,
   representing the intuitive extension of classical integral-transform
   solutions for a laterally homogeneous medium. This exponential
   propagator permits larger forward stepsizes. Numerical comparisons with
   Helmholtz (i.e. full) wave-equation finite-difference solutions are
   presented for various canonical problems. These include propagation
   along an interfacial gradient, the effects of a compact inclusion and
   the formation of extended transmitted and backscattered wave trains by
   model roughness. The ideas extend to the 3-D, generally anisotropic case
   and to multiple scattering by invariant embedding. It is concluded that
   the method is very competitive, striking a new balance between
   simplifying approximations and computational labour. Complicated
   wave-scattering effects are retained without the need for expensive
   global solutions, providing a robust and flexible modelling tool.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, meteorological observations have been made for operational
   forecasting rather than long-term monitoring purposes, so that there
   have been numerous changes in instrumentation and procedures. Hence to
   create climate quality datasets requires the identification, estimation,
   and removal of many nonclimatic biases from the historical data.
   Construction of a number of new tropospheric temperature climate
   datasets has highlighted previously unrecognized uncertainty in
   multidecadal temperature trends aloft. The choice of dataset can even
   change the sign of upper-air trends relative to those reported at the
   surface. So structural uncertainty introduced unintentionally through
   dataset construction choices is important and needs to be understood and
   mitigated. A number of ways that this could be addressed for historical
   records are discussed, as is the question of How it needs to be reduced
   through future coordinated observing systems with long-term monitoring
   as a driver, enabling explicit calculation, and removal of nonclimatic
   biases. Although upper-air temperature records are used to illustrate
   the arguments, it is strongly believed that the findings are applicable
   to all long-term climate datasets and variables. A full characterization
   of observational uncertainty is as vitally important as recent intensive
   efforts to understand climate model uncertainties if the goal to
   rigorously reduce the uncertainty regarding both past and future climate
   changes is to be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) releasing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
   (NSAIDs) have shown a marked reduction of gastrointestinal side effects
   and we here examined the cytotoxicity of NCX 530 (NO-indomethacin).
   Under conditions where indomethacin clearly induced both necrosis and
   apoptosis, NCX 530 induced neither. NCX 530 protected cells from
   celecoxib-induced necrosis and apoptosis. NCX 530 partially suppressed
   celecoxib-dependent membrane permeabilization and an inhibitor for
   guanylate cyclase suppressed the cytoprotective effect of NCX 530
   against celecoxib. In vivo, NCX 530 alone produced fewer gastric lesions
   in rats than did indomethacin. A combination of the oral administration
   of celecoxib together with the intraperitoneal administration of
   indomethacin, but not of NCX 530, clearly resulted in the production of
   gastric lesions. The low direct cytotoxicity and the cytoprotective
   effect of NCX 530 observed in vitro may also act in vivo, thus ensuring
   that NCX 530 is safe for use on the gastric mucosa.}},

Abstract = {{Normally, bimolecular reactions are analyzed in terms of the
   Smoluchowski theory. However, when one attempts to generalize this
   analysis to cases where diffusion proceeds in two other than in three
   dimensions, one soon encounters severe conceptual difficulties. Although
   kinetic studies of membrane enzymes are generally difficult because the
   usual kinetic formalism refers to nonaggregated homogenous solutions, a
   major goal of our research is to define the molecular mechanism(s) by
   which alterations in membrane-bound substrate contents affect the enzyme
   activity in the same membrane. For that purpose, a simplified
   random-walk model was adopted in the present work. The enzyme reaction
   in the two-dimensional membrane could be calculated theoretically by
   applying the classical analysis of heat equation. As a result, the
   theoretical rate equation well accounting experimental findings was
   derived on the model of the liver microsomal NADH-cytochrome b5
   reductase reaction. Furthermore, it was found that the modification of
   the simple rigid-sphere collision theory by including a term called the
   steric factor was not necessary in this derived equation.}},

Abstract = {{Image morphing has been extensively studied in computer graphics and it
   can be summarized as follows: given two input images, morphing
   algorithms produce a sequence of inbetween images which transforms the
   source image into the target image in a visually pleasant way. In this
   paper, we propose an algorithm, based on recent advances from
   texture-from-sample ideas, which synthesizes a metamorphosis sequence
   targeted specifically for textures. We use the idea of binary masks-or
   texton masks-to control and drive the morphing sequence. Our solution
   provides an automatic mapping from source texels into target texels and
   thus guarantees a coherent and visually smoothing transition from the
   source texture into the target texture. We compare our morphing results
   with prior work and with simple interpolation between corresponding
   pixels in the same source and target images. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background: Wound infection rates after various types of bariatric
   operations have been well described. The question of whether bariatric
   surgery increases wound infection rate compared with similar elective
   surgical procedures in obese patients has not been clearly answered. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate wound status of morbidly obese
   patients after elective general surgery.
   Methods: A prospective evaluation was conducted of 141 morbidly obese
   patients undergoing bariatric (n=60) and non-bariatric elective general
   surgery operation of similar invasiveness (n=81) with the ASEPSIS wound
   surveillance method.
   Results: Median age of patients undergoing non-bariatric elective
   surgery (51, 32-68) was significantly higher than patients exposed to
   bariatric surgery (39, 24-57). Patients undergoing bariatric surgery had
   higher BMIs (44.0, 35-52.5) compared to the others (38.4, 35-43). All
   patients enrolled in the study were followed for a 21-day period. At the
   7th postoperative day, 9 patients in the bariatric surgery group
   developed infection (15\%), whereas 13 patients (16\%) in the
   non-bariatric surgery group suffered wound infection. Wound infection
   was still present in 2 patients (3.4\%) in the bariatric surgery group
   and 3 patients (3.7\%) in the non-bariatric surgery group at the 21st
   day. Risk factors for wound infection included history of coronary
   artery diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory illness and malignant
   disease.
   Conclusion: Bariatric surgery does not cause an additional risk of
   postoperative wound infection in morbidly obese patients, compared to
   elective general surgical operations of the same invasiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Four captive specimens of sandbar shark Carcharhinus plumbeus from the
   l'Oceanografic Aquarium (Valencia, Spain) were studied: one adult female
   (192cm total length {[}TL]) reared for five months, her two new born
   pups (a female, 61 cm TL and a male, 60cm TL), and one juvenile female,
   born in captivity, dead at nine months of age (90 cm TL). Comparative
   measurements of length and diameter of vertebrae from three different
   regions of the vertebral column showed that vertebrae above the pelvic
   fills (nos. 5963) are the biggest ill this species. Consequently, these
   vertebrae are preferred for age estimation given that growth marks are
   easier to identify. The only present mark in the vertebrae of the two
   neonate specimens was at the edge and was Interpreted its the birth
   mark. A mark at a similar distance was present ill the vertebrae of the
   juvenile and adult females.
   Adult female vertebrae analysis shows 23 marks without. ally variation
   ill the banding pattern distribution during free-range growth and short
   period of captivity. The juvenile individual shows two clear growth
   marks developed after birth. The presence of these marks in a 9-month
   old individual suggests that the counting of all vertebral growth marks
   its annuli may result ill the overestimation of age for this shark
   species.}},

   also for weak electrolytes. The differential equation system was
   analytically solved for the steady-state and the dynamic case. The
   parameterization was for a generic human cell, with a 60 mV more
   negative potential at the inner mitochondrial membrane of generic tumor
   cells. The chemical input data were the lipophilicity (logK(OW)), the
   acid/base dissociation constant (pK(a)) and the electric charge (z).
   Accumulation in mitochondria occurred for polar acids with pK(a) between
   5 and 9 owing to the ion trap, and for lipophilic bases with pK(a)> 11
   or permanent cations owing to electrical attraction. Selective
   accumulation in tumor cells was found for monovalent cations or strong
   bases with logK(OW) of the cation between -2 and 2, with the optimum
   near 0. The results are in agreement with experimental results for
   rhodamine 123, a series of cationic triarylmethane dyes, F16 and
   MKT-077, an anticancer drug targeting tumor mitochondria.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective. - Evaluation of efficacy and safety of pristinamycin
   (PRI), compared with amoxicillin (AMX), both at 3 g daily for 7 to 10
   days in adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
   Patients and methods. - Multinational, randomized, double blind, double
   dummy clinical trial of non-inferiority was conducted in 399 patients
   with a CAP.
   Results. - At inclusion, the mean age was 47.8 +/- 18.3 years, 24.3\%
   patients were 65 or older. The Fine score was <= III in 85.4\% patients.
   The bacterial etiology was documented in 34.8\% of patients:
   Streptococcus pneumoniae (48.1\%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (18.6\%),
   Haemophilus influenzae (14.7\%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (13.2\%),
   Legionella pneumophila (9.3\%). In the clinical perprotocol population,
   the clinical success rate was 87.6\% in each group: 149/170 patients
   (PRI) and 148/169 (AMX); The 95\% confidence interval was {[}-6.61\%;
   7.23\%]. In modified intend to treat population, the clinical success
   rate was 79.9\% (151/189) in the PRI group and 83.0\% (151/182) in the
   AMX group {[}CI 95\% (-10.87\%; 4.69\%)]. A satisfactory bacteriological
   response was observed in 82.3\% (51/62) of PRI patients and 88.1\%
   (59/67) of AMX patients. Treatment related adverse events occurred
   similarly in both groups according to the expected tolerance profile of
   the two drugs. No serious adverse events in both groups were related to
   the study drugs.
   Conclusions. - In this study, PRI 3 g daily was clinically as effective
   and well tolerated as AMX 3 g daily, for 7 to 10 days, in PPc, in the
   treatment of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Title = {{The folding landscape of an alpha-lytic protease variant reveals the

Abstract = {{Most secreted bacterial proteases, including alpha-lytic protease (alpha
   LP), are synthesized with covalently attached pro regions necessary for
   their folding. The alpha LP folding landscape revealed that its pro
   region, a potent folding catalyst, is required to circumvent an
   extremely large folding free energy of activation that appears to be a
   consequence of its unique unfolding transition. Remarkably, the alpha LP
   native state is thermodynamically unstable; a large unfolding free
   energy barrier is solely responsible for the persistence of its native
   state. Although alpha LP folding is well characterized, the structural
   origins of its remarkable folding mechanism remain unclear. A conserved
   beta-hairpin in the C-terminal domain was identified as a structural
   element whose formation and positioning may contribute to the large
   folding free energy barrier. In this article, we characterize the
   folding of an aLP variant with a more favorable beta-hairpin turn
   conformation (alpha LP (beta-turn)). Indeed, alpha LP beta-turn pro
   region catalyzed folding is faster than that for aLP. However, instead
   of accelerating spontaneous folding, alpha LP beta-turn actually unfolds
   more slowly than alpha LP. Our data support a model where the
   beta-hairpin is formed early, but its packing with a loop in the
   N-terminal domain happens late in the folding reaction. This tight
   packing at the domain interface enhances the kinetic stability of alpha
   Lp (beta-turn), to nearly the same degree as the change between alpha LP
   and a faster folding homolog. However, alpha LP (beta-turn) has impaired
   proteolytic activity that negates the beneficial folding properties of
   this variant. This study demonstrates the evolutionary limitations
   imposed by the simultaneous optimization of folding and functional
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is an Epstein-Barr
   virus (EBV) associated malignancy that occurs in the setting of
   pharmacologic immunosuppression used after organ transplantation. The
   presence of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) after organ transplantation is a
   risk factor for the development of PTLD. We retrospectively explored the
   characteristics of serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) in 38 adult
   solid organ transplant patients with biopsy proven PTLD and SPEP.
   Twenty-three (61\%) had MG with nine (24\%) showing multiple MG.
   Background gammaglobulin levels were abnormal in 13 (34\%) patients with
   five (13\%) and eight (21\%) having polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia or
   hypogammaglobulinemia, respectively. Hypogammaglobulinemia was
   correlated with the presence of MG (p = 0.01) and polymorphic B-cell
   hyperplasia histology (p = 0.01). No correlation between SPEP findings
   and overall survival were noted. With median follow-up of 116 wk (range
   2-261 wk), 21 (55\%) patients are alive with 20 (53\%) in complete
   remission. Response to reduction in immunosuppression was correlated
   with improved overall survival (262 wk vs. 68 wk, p = 0.003).
   Persistence of MG after complete response of the PTLD did not predict
   relapse. There is a high incidence of MG and gammaglobulin abnormalities

Abstract = {{The shadow moire technique, which is a straightforward method for
   contactless non-destructive metrological measurements associated with
   digital image processing, was used to erect a micro-movement measurement
   system and to design a dilatometer. By adjusting the angle of
   inclination of the reference grating and the angle of incident light,
   the sensitivity of the measurement system could be controlled. A
   piezoelectric material with nanometer precision was used to calibrate
   the measurement system. The moire interference fringes grabbed by a CCD
   camera were obtained and then input into the computer, in which the
   digital image processing technique was employed to improve the
   resolution of the fringes dramatically. The results revealed that one
   could measure the micro-movement accurately with a slight error of about
   4\% using the present set-up. A dilatometer equipped with the
   above-mentioned measurement system was established. By comparing the
   thermal expansion of the specimen with the reference material, the
   thermal expansion coefficient of the specimen can be determined
   precisely, which agrees well with the literature values.}},

   (MANETs). The sinkhole effect is caused by attempts to draw all network
   traffic to malicious nodes that broadcast fake shortest path routing
   information. Two reliable indicators of sinkhole intrusion are proposed
   and analyzed. We will study how these sinkholes may be detected and term
   such as sinkhole intrusion detection. One indicator is based on the
   sequence number in the routing message and the other one is related to
   the proportion of the routes that travel to a suspected node. Threshold
   values that imply possible sinkhole intrusion are derived for these two
   indicators. The simulation results show that the indicators are
   consistent and reliable for detecting sinkhole intrusion. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: The utility of ferucarbotran for the diagnosis
   of bone metastases was investigated using tumor-implanted rabbits. The
   potential of ferucarbotran in the differential diagnosis of metastasis
   and inflammation was also investigated.
   Methods: Twelve rabbits were divided into 2 groups (tumor and
   inflammation groups). Six rabbits of tumor group were inoculated with
   VX2 tumor cell suspension, and the 6 rabbits of the inflammation group
   were inoculated with 10\% croton oil in the bone marrow of the right
   femur. All rabbits were imaged using a clinical MRI system. Signal
   intensity in the bone marrow of the right femur was measured in each
   rabbit before and after the intravenous injection of 8 mu mol Fe/kg of
   ferucarbotran. As a control, the signal intensity in the bone marrow of
   the left femur (the normal, intact femur) was measured in each rabbit.
   The change in signal intensity of each group was compared statistically.
   After MRI imaging, the femora were removed, and sections were prepared
   for microscopic examination.
   Results: Signal intensity in the right femur of the tumor group did not
   change after injection, although that of the inflammation group and the
   control group decreased. In the histologic findings, tumors were widely
   spread in the right femur of the tumor group. The infiltration of
   pseudoeosinocytes was induced in the right femur of the inflammation
   group.
   Conclusions: This animal study showed that ferucarbotran was useful to
   detect bone marrow tumors. In addition, ferucarbotran may have potential
   in the differential diagnosis of bone metastasis and some kinds of
   inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Steam reforming of oils derived from plastics has been investigated to
   produce gas from waste plastics. Two types of oils, from polyethylene
   and from polystyrene, were produced by thermal decomposition at
   relatively low temperatures (350-450 degrees C). Steam reforming of
   these oils was conducted at temperatures from 650 to 850 degrees C under
   a pressure of 1 atm using three types of Ni-Al2O3 catalysts. Gas yield,
   gas composition, carbon conversion, and the coking ratio for these
   catalysts were measured. Although the plastic-derived oils contain heavy
   hydrocarbons or aromatics, they are gasified well with a low coking rate
   at temperatures above 800 degrees C and a steam carbon ratio = 3.5 and
   LHSV = 1 h(-t). Among the three catalysts, C11NK, which is a commercial
   steam reforming catalyst for naphtha, possessed moderate activity, but
   had the lowest rate of coking. Gas compositions agreed well with values
   calculated from chemical equilibria. Product gas contained approximately
   72 vol\% hydrogen for polyethylene-derived oil and 68 vol\% for
   polystyrene-derived oil.}},

   X-SCID has been reported as JAK3 deficiency. 2,3 JAK3 is the only
   tyrosine kinase known to be directly associated with the gamma c chain,
   which is essential for signal transduction through gamma c-containing
   receptors for interleukins 2, 4, 7, 9, 15 and 21.(1) So far, 37 patients

Abstract = {{Nondestructive visible/near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was evaluated to
   investigate whether fish has been frozen-thawed. Fresh or frozen-thawed
   red sea bream Pagrus major (n = 108) were scanned using a NIRSystems
   6500 spectrophotometer equipped with a surface interactance fiber-optic
   accessory then discriminated by soft independent modeling of class
   analogy (SIMCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based on
   principal component analysis (PCA) scores. The major effect of
   freeze-thawing treatment involves a gross change in total reflectance
   after freezing and thawing; this arises from changes in light scatter
   presumably arising from alterations in the physical structure of at
   least the surface layer of fish. Untreated original absorbance spectra
   achieved much better (100\%) classification accuracy for the prediction
   samples while the same figures for multiplicative scatter correction
   (MSC) treated spectra are considerably worse, indicating that scattering
   is the major information that makes classification work. No incorrect
   type of classification at all and also there are no samples classified
   to both groups either: This faster technique has the potential to
   differentiate fresh and frozen-thawed fish and could be applied for

Abstract = {{The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on

   were created by rotating the right testis 720 degrees in a clockwise
   direction for 4 h in all groups except the control group (group 1). They
   were then repaired by counter-rotation and replaced into the scrotum. In
   group 2, saline was infused 30 min before detorsion. In group 3, 30
   mg/kg resveratrol was infused 30 min before detorsion. In groups 2 and
   3, the bilateral testes were removed to determine germ cell apoptosis
   after 20 h of detorsion. The number of apoptotic cells was evaluated
   using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin
   nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique and caspase 3. Mean apoptotic score
   of ipsilateral testes in group 3 was lower than that of group 2 (p <
   0.05). Mean apoptotic score of the contralateral testes in group 3 was
   not different from that of group 2 (p > 0.05). The present study
   demonstrates that intraperitoneal administration of resveratrol in rats

Abstract = {{We present time-dependent ab initio calculations of fragmenting H-2(+)
   and H-2 molecules in strong laser fields, taking into account all
   nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. In particular, very different
   and apparently contradicting experimental observations on the alignment
   of fragmenting hydrogen molecules are naturally explained and
   consistently interpreted. In addition, striking differences in the
   alignment of fragmenting H-2(+) and H-2 are predicted. Whereas H-2
   fragments show decreasing alignment with increasing laser intensity, the
   alignment of H-2(+) fragments is nearly independent of the intensity.
   This is in contrast to existing intuitive expectations, but in accord
   with available experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical models of solar and stellar chromospheres heated by acoustic
   waves have so far been constructed by using time-dependent,
   one-dimensional, radiation-hydrodynamic numerical codes that are based
   on the approximation of plane-parallel geometry. The approach seems to
   be justified by the fact that the chromospheres of most stars extend
   over very narrow height ranges compared to the stellar radius. It is
   demonstrated that this commonly used assumption may lead to unrealistic
   shock mergings, to the artificial formation of unusually strong shocks
   and the artificial destruction of high-frequency acoustic wave power.
   Comparing one-dimensional calculations with observations may lead to
   severe misjudgment about the nature of chromospheric heating.}},

Abstract = {{Protective and functional coatings for tools and components are nowadays
   required in an increasingly demanding and sophisticated profile with
   respect to the desired mechanical, tribological, physical or chemical
   properties. Frequently, the necessary requirements can only be realized
   by multi-functional coatings through a nano-scale thin-film design. CVD-
   and PVD-coatings in the material system B-C-N-H are known for their
   outstanding properties. Depending on the materials selection within this
   system and detailed coating design, extremely high hardness, low
   friction and excellent chemical stability can be obtained. Here it is
   shown that coatings with well tailored properties can be achieved
   according to special coating concepts, in particular through multilayers
   and nanocomposites, in conjunction with the control of surface
   processes. Several designs and optimization examples for anticipated
   nano-scale multi-frinctional coatings will be presented, showing the
   fundamental significance of the underlying knowledge, i.e. the
   interdependent relationships between the constitution and microstructure
   of the coating systems, the energy and momentum input of the processing
   particles during nucleation and growth of the coatings, the mechanical
   properties, and the operation performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   SWNTs with a narrow diameter distribution without amorphous carbon can
   be grown using Co acetate catalyst doped with Fe acetate above 750
   degrees C. Defective multiwalled nanotubes were observed at lower

Abstract = {{Aim To evaluate maternal and paternal smoking habits during pregnancy
   and determine their correlation with pregnancy complications and newborn
   status.
   Methods The study included499 pregnant women who delivered at the
   Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Uludag University School of
   Medicine, over a period of one year. Women were interviewed about their
   smoking habits before and during pregnancy. They were also asked about
   the smoking habits of their spouses. The relationship between smoking
   habits and pregnancy complications and newborn status was researched.
   The outcomes measured included pregnancy complications, gestational age
   at the onset of labor, Apgar scores during labor, and fetal birth weight
   and height.
   Results The percentage of maternal smoking before pregnancy was 26.5\%
   (n = 132) and decreased to 9.8\% (n =49) at the end of pregnancy, with
   52.5\% (n = 262) of the fathers who continued to smoke at home during
   their wife's pregnancy. Low birth weight and preterm delivery rate were
   significantly higher in maternal (n = 15 {[}30.6\%], and n = 12
   {[}24.5\%], respectively) and paternal smoking groups (n = 52 {[}22.4\%]
   and n = 54 {[}23.3\%1, respectively). Paternal smoking had no effect on
   intrauterine growth retardation (n = 10 {[}4.3\%]) and prenatal death (n
   =4 {[}1.7\%]), although maternal smoking had such an effect (n = 7
   {[}14.3\%] and n = 3 {[}6.1\%], respectively).
   Conclusion Maternal smoking is a major risk factor for preterm delivery,
   low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, and intrauterine
   death, but paternal smoking also carries risk for the fetus. During
   perinatal care, we should educate the expectant parents about the side
   effects, not only of maternal, but also of paternal smoking.}},

Abstract = {{We study time-dependent hydrogen ionization in the atmosphere of SN
   1987A during the first month after the supernova explosion. The model
   includes kinetics of hydrogen ionization and excitation, molecular
   hydrogen kinetics, and a time-dependent energy balance. The primary
   strong effect of the time-dependent ionization is the enhanced hydrogen
   ionization compared to the steady-state model. The time-dependent
   ionization provides a sufficient population of excited hydrogen levels
   to account for the observed H alpha without invoking the external Ni-56.
   We find that the Ba II 6142 angstrom line in SN 1987A can be reproduced
   for the LMC barium abundance. This resolves the long-standing problem of
   the unacceptably high barium overabundance in SN 1987A. The key missing
   factor responsible for the ``barium problem{''} is the time-dependent
   ionization. The modelling of the H alpha profile on day 4.64 indicates
   the ratio of the kinetic energy to the ejected mass approximate to
   0.83x10(50) erg M-circle dot(-1).}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The celebrated simplicity of the EM algorithm is somewhat lost in its
   common use for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) because of its
   analytically intractable E-step. A natural and typical strategy in
   practice is to implement the E-step via Monte Carlo by drawing the
   unobserved random effects from their conditional distribution as
   specified by the E-step. In this paper, we show that further augmenting
   the missing data (e.g., the random effects) used by the M-step leads to
   a quite attractive and general slice sampler for implementing the Monte
   Carlo E-step. The slice sampler scheme is straightforward to implement,
   and it is neither restricted to the particular choice of the link
   function (e.g., probit) nor to the distribution of the random effects
   (e.g., normal). We apply this scheme to the standard EM algorithm as
   well as to an alternative EM algorithm which treats the
   variance-standardized random effects, rather than the random effects
   themselves, as missing data. The alternative EM algorithm does not only
   have faster convergence, but also leads to generalized linear model-like
   variance estimation, because it converts the random-effect standard
   deviations into linear regression parameters. Using the well-known
   salamander mating problem, we compare these two algorithms with each
   other, as well as with a variety of methods given in the literature in
   terms of the resulting point and interval estimates.}},

   that lamins modulate cellular responses to TGF-beta 1 signalling, via
   the regulation of these transcription factors in mesenchymal cells.
   Here, we report that A-type lamins are essential for the inhibition of
   fibroblast proliferation by TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 1 dephosphorylated pRB
   through PP2A, both of which, we show, are associated with lamin A/C. In
   addition, lamin A/C modulates the effect of TGF-beta 1 on collagen
   production, a marker of mesenchymal differentiation. Our findings
   implicate lamin A/C in control of gene activity downstream of TGF-beta
   1, via nuclear phosphatases such as PP2A. This biological function
   provides a novel explanation for the observed mesenchymal dysfunction in
   laminopathies.}},

Abstract = {{Amylomaltases or D-enzyme (4-alpha-glucanotransferases; E.C. 2.4.1.25)
   are carbohydrate-active enzymes that catalyze the transfer of glucan
   units from one a-glucan to another in a disproportionation reaction.
   These enzymes are involved in starch metabolism in plants or
   maltose/glycogen metabolism in many microorganisms. The amylomaltase of
   the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8 was
   overproduced in Escherichia coli, partially purified and used to modify
   potato starch. The action of amylomaltase caused the disappearance of
   amylose and the broadening of the side-chain length distribution in
   amylopectin, which resulted in a product with both shorter and longer
   side chains than in the parent starch. Amylomaltase-treated potato
   starch showed thermoreversible gelation at concentrations of 3\% (w/v)
   or more, thus making it comparable to gelatin. Because of its animal
   origin, gelatin is not accepted by several consumer groups. Therefore,
   the amylomaltase-treated potato starch might be a good plant-derived
   substitute for gelatin.}},

Abstract = {{Ever since their invention 30 years ago, checked exceptions have been a
   point of much discussion. On the one hand, they increase the robustness
   of software by preventing the manifestation of unanticipated checked
   exceptions at run-time. On the other hand, they decrease the
   adaptability of software because they must be propagated explicitly, and
   must often be handled even if they cannot be signalled.
   We show that the problems with checked exceptions are caused by a lack
   of expressiveness of the exceptional return type of a method, which
   currently dictates a copy \& paste style. We add the required
   expressiveness by introducing anchored exception declarations, which
   allow the exceptional behavior of a method to be declared relative to
   that of others. We present the formal semantics of anchored exception
   declarations, along with the necessary rules for ensuring compile-time
   safety, and give a proof of soundness. We show that anchored exception
   declarations do not violate the principle of information hiding when
   used properly, and provide a guideline for when to use them.
   We have implemented anchored exception declarations in Cappuccino, which
   is an extension to the ClassicJava programming language.}},

Abstract = {{Apigenin is a nonmutagenic bioflavonoid that has been shown to be an
   inhibitor of mouse skin carcinogenesis induced by the two-stage regimen
   of initiation and promotion with dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) and
   12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). These DMBA/TPA-induced
   squamous cell carcinomas overexpress cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).
   Cyclooxygenases are key enzymes required for prostaglandin (PG)
   synthesis, converting the arachidonic acid (AA) released by
   phospholipase A2 into prostaglandins. A large body of evidence indicates
   that the inducible form of cyclooxygenase, COX-2, is involved in tumor
   promotion and carcinogenesis in a wide variety of tissue types,
   including colon, breast, lung, and skin. In the present study, we have
   determined that apigenin inhibited the TPA-induced increase in COX-2
   protein and mRNA in the human keratinocyte cell line; HaCaT. The
   induction of COX-2 elicited by TPA correlated with increased activation
   of Akt kinase and cell treatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitor,
   LY294002, blocked TPA induction of COX-2. In cells treated with TPA and
   apigenin, the inhibition of COX-2 expression correlated with inhibition
   of Akt kinase activation. Apigenin-mediated inhibition of TPA-induced
   COX-2 expression was reversed by transient transfection with
   constitutively active Akt (CA-Akt). Chemical inhibitors of MEK
   (PD98059), p38 (SB202190), but not JNK (SP600125) blocked TPA induction
   of COX-2 although apigenin did not inhibit TPA-mediated COX-2 expression
   through these pathways. The TPA-induced release of AA from HaCaT cells
   was also inhibited by cell treatment with apigenin. These data show that
   apigenin inhibits TPA-mediated COX-2 expression by blocking signal
   transduction of Akt and that apigenin also blocks AA release, which may
   contribute to its chemopreventive activity. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   bifurcation analysis using time-steppers: a reaction-diffusion example,
   Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 97 (18) (2000) 9840-9843]. We extend the results
   obtained in that paper for a one-dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo lattice
   Boltzmann (LB) model in several ways. First, we extend the
   coarse-grained time stepper concept to enable the computation of
   periodic solutions and we use the more versatile Newton-Picard method
   rather than the Recursive Projection Method (RPM) for the numerical
   bifurcation analysis. Second, we compare the obtained bifurcation
   diagram with the bifurcation diagrams of the corresponding macroscopic
   PDE and of the lattice Boltzmann model. Most importantly, we perform an
   extensive study of the influence of the lifting or reconstruction step
   on the minimal successful time step of the coarse-grained time stepper
   and the accuracy of the results. It is shown experimentally that this
   time step must often be much larger than the time it takes for the
   higher-order moments to become slaved by the lowest-order moment, which
   somewhat contradicts earlier claims. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A variety of neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and
   magnetoencephalography (MEG), have been established during the last few
   decades, with progressive improvements continuously taking place in the
   underlying technologies. In contrast to this, the recording bandwidth of
   the routine clinical EEG (typically around 0.5-50 Hz) that was
   originally set by trivial technical limitations has remained practically
   unaltered for over half a decade. An increasing amount of evidence shows
   that salient EEG signals take place and can be recorded beyond the
   conventional clinical EEG bandwidth. These physiological and
   pathological EEG activities range from 0.01 Hz to several hundred Hz,
   and they have been demonstrated in recordings of spontaneous activity in
   the preterm human brain, and during epileptic seizures, sleep, as well
   as in various kinds of cognitive tasks and states in the adult brain. In
   the present paper, we will describe the practical aspects of recording
   the full physiological frequency band of the EEG (Full-band EEG; FbEEG),
   and we review the currently available data on the clinical applications
   of FbEEG.
   Recording the FbEEG is readily attained with commercially available
   direct-current (DC) coupled amplifiers if the recording setup includes
   electrodes providing a DC-stable electrode-skin interface. FbEEG does
   not have trade-offs that would favor any frequency band at the expense
   of another. We present several arguments showing that elimination of the
   lower (infraslow) or higher (ultrafast) bands of the EEG frequency
   spectrum in routine EEG has led, and will lead, to situations where
   salient and physiologically meaningful features of brain activity remain
   undetected or become seriously attenuated and distorted. With the
   currently available electrode, amplifier and data acquisition
   technology, it is to be expected that FbEEG will become the standard
   approach in both clinical and basic science.}},

Abstract = {{The GATA factor Pannier (Pnr) activates proneural expression through
   binding to a remote enhancer of the achaete-scute (ac-sc) complex. Chip
   associates both with Pnr and with the (Ac-Sc)-Daughterless heterodimer
   bound to the ac-sc promoters to give a proneural complex that
   facilitates enhancer-promoter communication during development. Using a
   yeast two-hybrid screening, we have identified Toutatis (Tou), which
   physically interacts with both Pnr and Chip. Loss-of-function and
   gain-of-function experiments indicate that Tou cooperates with Pnr and
   Chip during neural development. Ton shares functional domains with
   chromatin remodelling proteins, including TIP5 (termination factor
   TTFI-interacting protein 5) of NoRC (nucleolar remodelling complex),
   which mediates repression of RNA polymerase 1 transcription. In
   contrast, Ton acts positively to activate proneural gene expression.
   Moreover, we show that Iswi associates with Tou, Pnr and Chip, and is
   also required during Pnr-driven neural development. The results suggest
   that Ton and Iswi may belong to a complex that directly regulates the
   activity of Pnr and Chip during enhancer-promoter communication,
   possibly through chromatin remodelling.}},

Abstract = {{A new set of 5,6-dihydro-pyrazolo{[}1,5-c]quinazoline-2-carboxylates
   (2-18), bearing different substituents (COOEt, Cl, Br, CH3, and COOH) at
   position-1, were synthesized in order to investigate the influence of
   various groups at this specific position on Gly/NMDA receptor affinity
   and/or selectivity. All the herein reported compounds were evaluated for
   their binding at the Gly/NMDA, AMPA, and KA receptors. Some selected
   compounds were also tested for their functional antagonistic activity at
   both the AMPA and NMDA receptor-ion channels.
   The results obtained in this study have highlighted that a C-I
   lipophilic substituent on the pyrazolo{[}1,5-c]quinazoline-2-carboxylate
   core shifts selectivity toward the Gly/NMDA receptor, while a C-I
   anionic carboxylate residue is able to increase affinity toward this
   receptor subtype. In particular, the 2-carboxylic acids 15 and 16,
   bearing a chlorine atom at position-1, are not only potent (K-i = 0.18
   and 0. 16 mu M, respectively), but also highly Gly/NMDA versus AM PA
   selective (selectivity ratio > 500). Furthermore, the 1,2-dicarboxylic
   acids 13 and 14 are endowed with the highest Gly/NMDA receptor binding
   activity (K-i = 0.09 and 0.059 mu M, respectively), among the
   pyrazoloquinazoline series of derivatives.
   A molecular modeling study has been carried out to better understand
   receptor affinity and selectivity of these new pyrazoloquinazoline

Abstract = {{Many reactive processes in complex materials involve absorption of
   diffusing molecules. Recently, there has been interest in particle
   interaction with partially absorbing (or permeable) traps. Here, we
   present a simple and efficient method for accounting for the
   non-diffusion-limited reaction of particles when the flux of particles
   to the trap is governed by surface permeability. The trapping
   probability is determined from a one-dimensional Green's function, which
   results in a simple algebraic expression. This expression, which applies
   in the region immediately adjacent to the trap, is then used with a
   first-passage approach far from the trap. When applied to a suspension
   of permeable traps, the method is seen to give accurate results over the
   concentration range. The method is applied to the competition of
   reactive particles in a suspension of permeable spheres with a reactive
   continuous phase. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Maternal deprivation can result in long-term impairment of
   neuronal functions and in the development of long-lasting behavioural
   disorders. Objectives: This study analysed the effects of a selective
   cholecystokinin-2 (CCK2) antagonist,
   3R-(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-3yl)-
   N'-(3-methyl phenyl) urea (L365,260), in anxiety- and stress-related
   behaviours of adult rats that were deprived (D) from their mother and
   littermates for 3 h everyday during 14 days after birth. Methods: The
   behaviour was studied in actimeter, in open field and after food and
   water deprivation. Corticosterone plasma levels were quantified after
   food and water deprivation. The effects of L365,260 were studied in the
   behavioural changes observed in D rats. Results: No differences in
   circadian motor activity between non-deprived (ND) and D rats were
   observed. D rats showed a 50\% decrease in their number of visits to the
   central (aversive) part of the open field compared to ND rats. This
   effect was suppressed by L365,260. After 20 h of food and water
   deprivation, an increase in plasma corticosterone was observed in D and
   ND rats. However, the raise of corticosterone secretion in D rats was
   dramatically increased (300\%) compared to ND rats, indicating a
   hypersensitised state revealed by this stressful situation. Consumption
   of sucrose solution (1\%) was higher for D rats than for ND rats after
   food and water deprivation. Sucrose consumption returned to control
   values following L365,260 treatment. Conclusions: These results suggest
   that maternal deprivation led to an increase in anxiety and stress
   reactivity in adulthood. We propose that these long-lasting changes are
   partly dependent on CCKergic transmission involving the activation of
   CCK2 receptors.}},

Abstract = {{in this work a superposition technique for designing gradient coils for
   the purpose of magnetic resonance imaging is outlined, which uses an
   optimized weight function superimposed upon an initial winding similar
   to that obtained from the target field method to generate the final wire
   winding. This work builds on the preliminary work performed in Part I on
   designing planar insertable gradient coils for high resolution imaging.
   The proposed superposition method for designing gradient coils results
   in coil patterns with relatively low inductances and the gradient coils
   can be used as inserts into existing magnetic resonance imaging

Abstract = {{The joint peristimulus time histogram ( JPSTH) provides a visual
   representation of the dynamics of correlated activity for a pair of
   neurons. There are many ways to adjust the JPSTH for the time- varying
   firing- rate modulation of each neuron, and then to define a suitable
   measure of time- varying correlated activity. Our approach is to
   introduce a statistical model for the time- varying joint spiking
   activity so that the joint firing rate can be estimated more
   efficiently. We have applied an adaptive smoothing method, which has
   been shown to be effective in capturing sudden changes in firing rate,
   to the ratio of joint firing probability to the probability of firing
   predicted by independence. A bootstrap procedure, applicable to both
   Poisson and non- Poisson data, was used to define a statistical
   significance test of whether a large ratio could be attributable to
   chance alone. A numerical simulation showed that the bootstrap- based
   significance test has very nearly the correct rejection probability, and
   can have markedly better power to detect departures from independence
   than does an approach based on testing contiguous bins in the JPSTH. In
   a companion paper, we show how this formulation can accommodate latency
   and time- varying excitability effects, which can confound spike timing
   effects.}},

Title = {{Pilot study of the development of a theory-based instrument to evaluate
   the communication process during multidisciplinary team conferences in
   rheumatology}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2005}},

Abstract = {{Background: Coordinated teams with multidisciplinary team conferences
   are generally seen as a solution to the management of complex health
   conditions. However, problems regarding the process of communication
   during team conferences are reported, such as the absence of a common
   language or viewpoint and the exchange of irrelevant or repeated
   information. To determine the outcome of interventions aimed at
   improving communication during team conferences, a reliable and valid
   assessment method is needed.
   Aim: To investigate the feasibility of a theory-based measurement
   instrument for assessing the process of the communication during
   multidisciplinary team conferences in rheumatology.
   Method: An observation instrument was developed based on communication
   theory. The instrument distinguishes three types of communication: (I)
   grounding activities, (II) coordination of non-team activities, and
   (III) coordination of team activities. To assess the process of
   communication during team conferences in a rheumatotogy clinic with
   inpatient and day patient facilities, team conferences were videotaped.
   To determine the inter-rater reliability, in 20 conferences concerning
   10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis admitted to the inpatient unit,
   the instrument was applied by two investigators independently. Content
   validity was determined by analysing and comparing the results of
   initial and follow-up team conferences of 25 consecutive patients with
   rheumatoid arthritis admitted to the day patient unit (Wilcoxon signed
   rank test).
   Results: The inter-rater reliabitity was excellent with the intra-class
   correlation coefficients being > 0.98 for both types I and III
   communications in 10 initial and 10 follow-up conferences (type II was
   not observed). An analysis of an additional 25 initial and 86 follow-up
   team conferences showed that time spent on grounding (type 1) made up
   the greater part of the contents of communication (87\% S.D. 14 and 60\%
   S.D. 29 in initial and follow-up conferences, respectively), which is
   significantly more compared to time spent on co-ordination (p < 0.001
   and 0.02 for categories II and III, respectively). Moreover,
   significantly less time spent was spent on grounding in follow-up as
   compared to initial team conferences, whereas the time spent on
   coordination (type III) increased (both p-values < 0.001).
   Conclusion: This theory-based measurement instrument for describing and
   evaluating the communication process during team conferences proved to
   be reliable and valid in this pilot study. Its usefulness to detect
   changes in the communication process, e.g. after implementing systems
   for re-structuring team conferences mediated by ICT applications, should
   be further examined. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a modified hybrid evolutionary

   the dynamic economic dispatch problem (DEDP) of generating units

   there is an improvement of solution (a feasible solution) in the EP run.
   Thus, the SQP guides EP for better performance in the complex solution
   space. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a 10-unit

Abstract = {{Factors controlling the magnitudes of, and short-term variations in, the
   potential temperatures of the snow surface and the air at the height of
   2 m (theta(S) and theta(2 m)) over Arctic sea ice in winter are
   analysed. The study addresses the winters of 1986-1987 and 1987-1988,
   and is based on the temperature, wind, and cloud observations made by
   Russian drifting ice stations. It also relies on the ERA40 re-analyses
   of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which were
   utilised to calculate the lateral heat advection at the sites of the ice
   stations. The cloud cover and wind speed were more important than the
   heat advection in controlling the magnitudes of theta(2 m) and theta(S),
   while on a time scale of 24 h, during steady forcing conditions, the
   heat advection was the most important factor affecting the changes in
   theta(S) and theta(2 m). During changing conditions, and considering
   individual factors separately, the monthly mean 24-h temperature changes
   were less than +/- 5 degrees C: the effect of the cloud cover was the
   largest, and that of the heat advection was the smallest. When
   simultaneous changes in the three factors were analysed, the seasonal
   mean temperature changes were even of the order of +/- 15 degrees C,
   with the strongest warming events exceeding 35 K in a single day. The
   difference theta(S) - theta(2m) reached its lowest seasonal mean values
   during conditions of clear skies (-1.3 degrees C), light winds (-1.3
   degrees C) and warm-air advection (-0.8 degrees C). theta(S) and theta(2

Abstract = {{Several studies have confirmed a decrease in the quality and quantity of
   milk of mothers with diabetes during lactation. However, it remains
   unclear how maternal diabetes affects the offspring specifically during
   lactation. The aim of this study was to evaluate body and mandibular
   growth and tooth eruption in pups suckling from diabetic dams. The study
   was performed on 13 Wistar rat pups that were born to dams that were
   subjected to experimental diabetes on the day of parturition. Body
   weight and body size were recorded regularly throughout the study. The
   experimental pups and a group of eight age-matched pups suckling from
   nondiabetic dams were killed at weaning. Both hemimandibles were excised
   and fixed. Right hemimandibles were radiographed to assess mandibular
   growth and tooth eruption. The left hemimandibles were processed to
   obtain buccolingually oriented sections at the level of the first mesial
   root of the first lower molar. Histologic and histomorphometric studies
   were performed. Results showed that body weight and body size were
   significantly lower in experimental animals at weaning compared with
   their age-matched controls. Smaller mandible size and reduced tooth
   eruption in experimental animals compared with controls were observed.
   The length, width, and bone volume of the developing alveolus were
   reduced in experimental animals compared with controls. The results
   obtained in this study allow the conclusion that suckling from diabetic
   dams results in reduced body, mandible size, and tooth eruption of the
   pups at weaning.}},

Abstract = {{A well-resolved rhizobial species phylogeny with 51 haplotypes was
   inferred from a combined atpD + recA data set using Bayesian inference
   with best-fit, gene-specific substitution models. Relatively dense taxon
   sampling for the genera Rhizobium and Mesorhizobium was achieved by
   generating atpD and recA sequences for six type and 24 reference strains
   not previously available in GenBank. This phylogeny was used to classify
   nine nodule isolates from Sesbania exasperata, S. punicea and S. sericea
   plants native to seasonally flooded areas of Venezuela, and compared
   with a PCR-RFLP analysis of rrs plus rrl genes and large maximum
   likelihood rrs and nifH phylogenies. We show that rrs phylogenies are
   particularly sensitive to strain choice due to the high levels of
   sequence mosaicism found at this locus. All analyses consistently
   identified the Sesbania isolates as Mesorhizobium plurifarium or
   Rhizobium huautlense. Host range experiments on ten legume species
   coupled with plasmid profiling uncovered potential novel biovarieties of
   both species. This study demonstrates the wide geographic and
   environmental distribution of M. plurifarium, that R. galegae and R.
   huautlense are sister lineages, and the synonymy of R. gallicum, R.
   mongolense and R. yanglingense. Complex and diverse phylogeographic,
   inheritance and host-association patterns were found for the symbiotic
   nifH locus. The results and the analytical approaches used herein are
   discussed in the context of rhizobial taxonomy and molecular
   systematics. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Drugs effective in Alzheimer-type dementia have been tested
   in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) because these are
   supposed to have Alzheimer's disease in the predementia stage.
   Objectives: To investigate whether MCI criteria used in these drug
   trials can accurately diagnose subjects with predementia Alzheimer's
   disease.
   Methods: MCI criteria of the Gal-Int 11 study, InDDEx study, ADCS memory
   impairment study, ampakine CX 516 study, piracetam study, and Merck
   rofecoxib study were applied retrospectively in a cohort of 150
   non-demented subjects from a memory clinic. Forty two had progressed to
   Alzheimer type dementia during a five year follow up period and were
   considered to have predementia Alzheimer's disease at baseline. Outcome
   measures were the odds ratio, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and
   negative predictive value.
   Results: The odds ratio of the MCI criteria for predementia Alzheimer's
   disease varied between 0.84 and 11. Sensitivity varied between 0.46 and
   0.83 and positive predictive value between 0.43 and 0.76. None of the
   criteria combined a high sensitivity with a high positive predictive
   value. Exclusion criteria for depression led to an increase in positive
   predictive value and specificity at the cost of sensitivity. In subjects
   older than 65 years the positive predictive value was higher than in
   younger subjects.
   Conclusions: The diagnostic accuracy of MCI criteria used in trials for
   predementia Alzheimer's disease is low to moderate. Their use may lead
   to inclusion of many patients who do not have predementia Alzheimer's
   disease or to exclusion of many who do. Subjects with moderately severe
   depression should not be excluded from trials in order not to reduce the
   sensitivity.}},

   multiresistant microorganisms (methicillinresitant Staphylococcus
   aureus, MRSA; vancomycin-resistant enterococci, VRE; third-generation

   hospitalized patients.
   Patients and Methods: All patients who experienced a bloodstream
   infection with one of the aforementioned pathogens between September
   1999 and October 2001 were included into a statistical analysis of
   independent risk factors. The possible impact of previous antibiotic and
   antifungal therapies was evaluated.
   Results: Of the study population, 22\% had two or more episodes with
   different pathogens. In the 314 patients with a single bloodstream
   infection MRSA was isolated in 189 patients, VRE in 31,
   Enterobacteriaceae in 13, and Candida spp. in 80 patients. Crude
   mortality was high in the study population (overall 40\%) and varied
   between 33\% (MRSA bacteremia only) and 58\% (VRE bacteremia only).
   Patients who yielded more than one of the pathogens under surveillance
   had crude mortalities ranging from 41\% to 83\% (all four pathogens). In
   this group of high-risk patients, the following factors were
   independently associated with the individual pathogen: prior
   chemotherapy (OR 4.88 CI95 1.50-15.87) and bronchoscopy (OR 3.17 CI95
   1.05-9.52) for VRE patients; burns (OR 4.50 CI95 0.90-22.73), presence
   of a tracheostomy (OR 4.22 CI95 1.15-15.38) and acute dialysis (OR 3.62

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine how closely the
   surgically induced sheep myelomeningocele (MMC) model resembles the
   central nervous system derangements seen in human disease, and identify
   which aspects of MMC are the result of the early neuronal developmental
   defect, and which are secondary to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   drainage.
   Study design: An MMC-like lesion was created surgically in 16 fetal
   sheep at 75 days' gestation: 5 died in utero, 7 underwent no fetal
   repair, 4 were repaired (2-layer closure or biological glue) at 100
   days' gestation. MMC sheep were delivered at term and allowed to survive
   up to 17 days for analysis of behavioral status and feeding behavior.
   Animals not repaired in utero were repaired at birth. All lambs were
   sacrificed and analyzed for hindbrain herniation, hydrocephalus, and
   other CNS, derangements.
   Results: Hindbrain herniation was observed in 43\% of animals not
   repaired in utero, and in 1 lamb repaired with Bioglue. No animal
   developed hydrocephalus or other CNS derangements.
   Conclusion: Although this sheep MMC-like model reproduces the CSF leak,
   but not the developmental defect seen in humans, it suggests CSF leak
   contributes to hindbrain herniation seen in humans. This model may be
   useful to develop new minimally invasive techniques to halt CSF leak in
   utero. (C) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Nowadays, most women born with aortic coarctation reach
   childbearing age. However, data on outcome of pregnancy in women after
   repair of aortic coarctation are scarce. The aim of this study was to
   report on maternal and neonatal outcome of pregnancy in women after
   aortic coarctation repair.
   Methods and results The CONCOR national registry on congenital heart
   disease in The Netherlands was reviewed for women of childbearing age
   (>= 18 years old) with a history of aortic coarctation repair. Medical
   history and maternal, obstetrical, and neonatal outcome were determined.
   Fifty-four of the 100 women included had a history of pregnancy. The 54
   women had 126 pregnancies resulting in 98 successful pregnancies, 22
   miscarriages, and six abortions. The success rate was estimated as 0.778
   (SE 0.002) including abortions and 0.817 (SE 0.002) excluding abortions.
   There were 85 vaginal deliveries, seven vaginal deliveries with epidural
   analgesia, and six caesarean sections. There were two neonatal deaths. A
   total of 26 pregnancies were complicated by a hypertensive disorder of
   pregnancy. There were 21 pregnancies in 14 women complicated by
   hypertension and five pregnancies in four women complicated by
   pre-eclampsia. The hypertension- and pre-eclampsia-probabilities were
   estimated as 0.183 (SE 0.285) and 0.061 (SE 0.211), respectively. During
   pregnancy, five patients had an increase >= 15 mmHg across the site of
   repair at echocardiography, but only one patient required reintervention
   for recoarctation after delivery. Four of the 98 children (4\%) had a
   congenital heart defect.
   Conclusion Pregnancy is well tolerated in women after repair of aortic
   coarctation. However, an excess of miscarriages and hypertensive
   disorders of pregnancy were found.}},

Abstract = {{Circuit tuning is an important task in the design of custom digital
   integrated circuits such as high-performance microprocessors. The goal
   is to improve certain aspects of the circuit, such as speed, area, or
   power, by optimally choosing the widths of the transistors. This task
   can be formulated as a large-scale nonlinear, nonconvex optimization
   problem, where function values and derivatives are obtained by
   simulation of individual gates. This application offers an excellent
   example of a nonlinear optimization problem, for which it is very
   desirable to increase the size of the problems that can be solved in a
   reasonable amount of time. In this paper we describe the mathematical
   formulation of this problem and the implementation of a circuit tuning
   tool. We demonstrate how the integration of a novel state-of-the-art
   interior point algorithm for nonlinear programming led to considerable
   improvement in efficiency and robustness. Particularly, as will be
   demonstrated with numerical results, the new approach has great
   potential for parallel and distributed computing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Background: Meningioma is the commonest brain tumor and many genetic
   abnormalities, such as the loss of chromosome 22q and the mutation of
   NF2, have been reported.
   Methods: These classical abnormalities were detected using Southern
   blot, PCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization and comparative genomic
   hybridization, but these methods examine only very, we used DNA limited
   regions or limited mapping resolution of the tumor genome. In this stud
   microarray assay, which detects numerous genetic abnormalities
   simultaneously and analyses a global assessment of molecular events in
   meningioma cells. We studied 31 meningiomas by GenoSensorArray 300 in
   order to detect the chromosomal aberrations and genetic abnormalities in
   the whole genome.
   Results: This study demonstrated not only classical chromosomal
   aberration, such as loss of chromosome 22q in 19 meningiomas (61.3\%),
   but also new genetic characteristics of meningiomas, such as
   amplification of MSH2 in 16 meningiomas (57.69\%), deletion of GSCL in
   13 meningiomas (41.9\%) and deletion of HIRA in seven meningiomas

Abstract = {{Rather than relying on an undifferentiated version of Michel Foucault's
   panopticon or conceptualizing surveillance as a straightforward top-down
   measure, this article contends that open-street closed-circuit
   television (CCTV) surveillance is generated from numerous and
   overlapping social positions. As a regulatory project within the
   overarching context of governance, open-street CCTV can be generated
   from above, from the middle, or from below. By ``above,{''} what is
   meant is some hierarchical political or administrative body. Business
   entrepreneurs constitute the ``middle.{''} By ``from below,{''} I mean
   that citizens themselves seek out regulatory measures for, their own
   communities through moral entrepreneurship, often in collusion with
   local news media. But the inverse is also true: power moves through
   populations, and thus citizens' groups have the power to contest
   regulatory measures in their communities. I substantiate these
   theoretical claims with media, questionnaire, and interview data
   regarding the proliferation of open-street CCTV in Canada. Drawing from
   the sociologies of governance, of risk, and of critical media studies,
   and offering a more nuanced theoretical trajectory than theories that
   reproduce top-down conceptualizations of power, politics, and
   communication, I challenge the reigning theoretical models pertaining to
   open-street CCTV surveillance so as to demonstrate how regulation
   through camera surveillance can be generated from any number of social
   positions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Atopic dermatitis was defined in 1933. Earlier descriptions
   have yet not been thoroughly studied.
   Objective: Our purpose was to identify the first images of atopic
   dermatitis among historical illustrations of skin diseases.
   Methods: We posted 20 selected images on an Internet site and asked
   experts in pediatric dermatology to decide whether or not they
   represented atopic dermatitis.
   Results: By means of the Delphi technique, a consensus could be reached
   for 19 of the 20 images. The experts' accuracy was good.
   Limitations: Thirty-one experts participated. No validated criteria were
   used for the selection of the images.
   Conclusion: The first representations of atopic dermatitis are
   engravings of skin diseases described tinder the names of strophulus
   confertus (Willan, 1796), lichen agrius (Willan, 1796), porrigo larvalis
   (Bateman, 1816), and eczema rubrum (Rayer, 1835). Teledermatology

Abstract = {{The routine use of surgical drains in total hip arthroplasty remains
   controversial. They have not been shown to decrease the rate of wound
   infection significantly and can provide a retrograde route for it. Their
   use does not reduce the size or incidence of post-operative wound
   haematomas. This prospective, randomised study was designed to evaluate
   the role of drains in routine total hip arthroplasty.
   We investigated 552 patients (577 hips) undergoing unilateral or
   bilateral total hip arthroplasty who had been randomised to either
   having a drain for 24 hours or not having a drain. All patients followed
   standardised pre-, intra-, and post-operative regimes and were
   independently assessed using the Harris hip score before operation and
   at six, 18 and 36 months follow-up.
   The rate of superficial and deep infection was 2.9\% and 0.4\%,
   respectively, in the drained group and 4.8\% and 0.7\%, respectively in
   the undrained group. One patient in the undrained group had a haematoma
   which did not require drainage or transfusion. The rate of transfusion
   after operation in the drained group was significantly higher than for
   undrained procedures (p < 0.042). The use of a drain did not influence
   the post-operative levels of haemoglobin, the revision rates, Harris hip
   scores, the length of hospital stay or the incidence of thromboembolism.
   We conclude that drains provide no clear advantage at total hip
   arthroplasty, represent an additional cost, and expose patients to a
   higher risk of transfusion.}},

Abstract = {{Baculoviral vectors can transduce neurons in the CNS but mediate only

   vector in which the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of adeno-associated

   neuron-specific promoter. When tested in rat brain, the new viral vector
   was able to provide transgene expression for at least 90 days.
   Immunohistological analysis demonstrated that ITR flanking did not
   affect the cellular preference of the neuronal promoter in the context
   of baculovirus. These findings establish an effective way to engineer
   baculoviral vectors in order to achieve sustained expression of a
   functional gene for gene therapy for neurodegenerative disorders and

Abstract = {{Precipitation exhibits significant spatial variability at scales much
   smaller than the typical size of climate model grid cells. Neglecting
   such subgrid-scale variability in climate models causes unrealistic
   representation of land-atmosphere flux exchanges. It is especially
   problematic over densely vegetated land. This paper addresses this issue
   by incorporating satellite-based precipitation observations into the
   representation of canopy interception processes in land surface models.
   Rainfall data derived from passive microwave (PM) observations are used
   to obtain realistic estimates of 1) conditional mean rain rates, which
   together with the modeled rain rate are used to estimate the rainfall
   coverage fraction at each model grid cell in this study, and 2) the
   probability density function (pdf) of rain rates within the rain-covered
   areas. Both of these properties significantly impact the land-atmosphere
   water vapor exchanges. Based on the above information, a
   statistical-dynamical approach is taken to incorporate the
   representation of precipitation subgrid variability into canopy
   interception processes in land surface models. The results reveal that
   incorporation of precipitation subgrid variability significantly alters
   the partitioning between runoff and total evapotranspiration as well as
   the partitioning among the three components of evapotranspiration (i.e.,
   canopy interception loss, ground evaporation, and plant transpiration).
   This further influences soil water, surface temperature, and surface
   heat fluxes. It is shown that the choice of the rain-rate pdf within
   rain-covered areas has an effect on the model simulation of
   land-atmosphere flux exchanges. This study demonstrates that land
   surface and climate models can substantially benefit from the
   fine-resolution remotely sensed rainfall observations.}},

Abstract = {{We isolated multiple copies of mariner-like element (MLE) from the pink

   belonging to the cecropia subfamily, and most similar to the MLE found
   in Antheraea species. Examining six different pink bollworm populations,

Title = {{A computational study of the aerodynamics and forewing-hindwing
   interaction of a model dragonfly in forward flight}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The aerodynamics and forewing-hindwing interaction of a model dragonfly
   in forward flight are studied, using the method of numerically solving
   the Navier-Stokes equations. Available morphological and
   stroke-kinematic parameters of dragonfly (Aeshna juncea) are used for
   the model dragonfly. Six advance ratios (J; ranging from 0 to 0.75) and,
   at each J, four forewing-hindwing phase angle differences (gamma(d); 180
   degrees, 90 degrees, 60 degrees and 0 degrees) are considered. The mean
   vertical force and thrust are made to balance the weight and body-drag,
   respectively, by adjusting the angles of attack of the wings, so that
   the flight could better approximate the real flight.
   At hovering and low J (J=0, 0.15), the model dragonfly uses separated
   flows or leading-edge vortices (LEV) on both the fore- and hindwing
   downstrokes; at medium J (J=0.30, 0.45), it uses the LEV on the forewing
   downstroke and attached flow on the hindwing downstroke; at high J
   (J=0.6, 0.75), it uses attached flows on both fore- and hindwing
   downstrokes. (The upstrokes are very lightly loaded and, in general, the
   flows are attached.)
   At a given J, at gamma(d)=180 degrees, there are two vertical force
   peaks in a cycle, one in the first half of the cycle, produced mainly by
   the hindwing downstroke, and the other in the second half of the cycle,
   produced mainly by the forewing downstroke; at gamma(d)=90 degrees, 60
   degrees and 0 degrees, the two force peaks merge into one peak. The
   vertical force is close to the resultant aerodynamic force {[}because
   the thrust (or body-drag) is much smaller than vertical force (or the
   weight)]. 55-65\% of the vertical force is contributed by the drag of
   the wings.
   The forewing-hindwing interaction is detrimental to the vertical force
   (and resultant force) generation. At hovering, the interaction reduces
   the mean vertical force (and resultant force) by 8-15\%, compared with
   that without interaction; as J increases, the reduction generally
   decreases (e.g. at J=0.6 and gamma(d)=90 degrees, it becomes 1.6\%). A
   possible reason for the detrimental interaction is as follows: each of
   the wings produces a mean vertical force coefficient close to half that
   needed for weight support, and a downward flow is generated in producing
   the vertical force; thus, in general, a wing moves in the
   downwash-velocity field induced by the other wing, reducing its
   aerodynamic forces.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of the investigation on the deposition
   and characterization of samarium cobalt (SmCo) thin films. To understand
   the underlayer effects on the magnetic properties, SmCo thin film's were
   deposited onto Cr/SiO2/Si, Cr/Si and Si at 600 degrees C and an
   operating argon pressure of 1.3 Pa using a direct current unbalanced
   magnetron sputtering technique. These films were characterized for
   composition, structure, microstructure and magnetic properties using
   Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry, X-ray Diffractometer, Atomic
   Force Microscope and Superconducting Quantum Interference Device,
   respectively. The films deposited on the three substrate/intermediate
   layer combinations have the same atomic composition Of SMCo5.51O0.4. All
   prepared films are crystalline with predominantly hexagonal Sm2Co17
   phase having grains of different orientations. The films deposited
   directly onto a Si substrate show relatively poor crystallinity and have
   a larger tensile residual stress in the film plane than those deposited
   with a Cr underlayer. The films prepared with a Cr underlayer are
   relatively dense with smaller grain sizes than those deposited directly
   onto a Si substrate. The in-plane hysteresis loops measured at room
   temperature indicate that the films deposited onto a Cr underlayer have
   relatively better magnetic properties. The use of a SiO2 film as a
   barrier layer between Cr and Si decreases the intrinsic coercivity of
   the film by about 6.3\% when compared with the film without a SiO2
   layer. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{beta-Elemene, a natural sesquiterpene, is a novel anti-tumor agent. The
   pharmacokinetics of beta-elemene after single i.v. administration have
   been investigated in male SD rats. beta-Elemene was administered at
   three doses (50, 75 and 100 mg/kg) and a full pharmacokinetic profile
   was obtained. beta-Elemene was metabolized extensively and eliminated
   rapidly. High permeability of fl-elemene through the blood-brain barrier
   was found following i.v. administration based on the brain/plasma ratio.
   Following i.v. administration, the drug was eliminated primarily as
   metabolite and minimally as unchanged drug. Cumulative fecal, biliary
   and urinary excretion of beta-elemene in rats was 0.61\%, 0.06\% and
   0.003\% of the administered dose (75 mg/kg) at 32 h after
   administration, respectively. These results indicate that
   biotransformation may be the main elimination passage of beta-elemene.
   The metabolism of beta-elemene was extensive and the structure of the
   metabolite (M1) in rat bile was determined by GS/MS and NMR analysis.

   cells was identified by morphological observation and molecular
   biological assay. After transfection, cells became slender, and their
   processes became thinner and were interwoven into a network. There were
   more organelles in the transfected cells than in the parental MSCs. The
   transfected cells exhibited mRNA expressions of BMP12, collagen type I
   and scleraxis, but not collagen type III mRNA expression.
   Immuno-cytochemical analysis also showed the presence of collagen type
   1, but not collagen type III in the transfected cells. The transfected
   cells were positive for CD44 and negative for HLA-DR. Therefore, MSCs
   can be introduced to differentiate into tenocytes by BMP12 gene
   transfection, and bone marrow MSCs can serve as an alternative seed cell
   for application in tendon tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{A miniaturized CE system has been developed for fast DNA separations

   liquid-core waveguide (LCW) and lock-in amplification techniques.
   ATeflon AF-coated silica capillary on a compact 6 x 3 cm baseplate
   served as both the separation channel for CE separation and as an LCW
   for light transmission of fluorescence emission to the detector. An
   electronically modulated LED illuminated transversely through a 0.2 mm
   aperture, the detection point on the LCW capillary without focusing, and
   fluorescence light was transmitted to the capillary outlet. To simplify
   the optics and enhance collection of light from the capillary outlet, an
   outlet reservoir was designed, with a light transmission window,
   positioned directly in front of a photomultiplier tube (PMT), separated
   only by a high pass filter. Automated sample introduction was achieved
   using a sequential injection system through a split-flow interface that
   allowed effective release of gas bubbles. In the separation of a phi
   X174 HaeIII DNA digest sample, using ethidium bromide as labeling dye,
   all 11 fragments of the sample were effectively resolved in 400 s, with

   DESIGN: Observational case series.
   METHODS: Included were all cases of choroidal metastases evaluated at
   National Taiwan University Hospital over an 11-year period. Patients
   with blood or lymphoproliferative diseases were excluded. Clinical
   features were correlated with disease entity and prognosis.
   RESULTS. A total of 36 patients with choroidal metastases were
   identified. The mean age was 53.9 +/- 12.8 years. The mean follow-up
   period was 5.1 +/- 4.2 months. The primary sites of tumors were lung in
   18 (50\%), breast in eight (22.2\%), gastrointestinal tract in three
   (8.3\%), pancreas in two (5.6\%), ovary in two (5.6\%), kidney in one
   (2.8\%), liver in one (2.8\%), and unknown in one (2.8\%). Twenty-two
   patients (61\%) died during follow, up. Mean life span after diagnosis
   was 4.3 months in these 22 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lung and breast cancers represent more than two thirds of

Title = {{Effectiveness of noncoplanar IMRT planning using a parallelized

   carcinoma}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the effectiveness of noncoplanar beam
   configurations and the benefit of plans using fewer but optimally placed
   beams designed by a parallelized multiple-resolution beam angle
   optimization (PMBAO) approach.
   Methods and Materials: The PMBAO approach uses a combination of coplanar
   and noncoplanar beam configurations for intensity-modulated radiation
   therapy (IMRT) treatment planning of paranasal sinus cancers. A smaller
   number of beams (e.g. 3) are first used to explore the solution space to
   determine the best and worst beam directions. The results of this
   exploration are then used as a starting point for determining an optimum
   beam orientation configuration with more beams (e.g. 5). This process is
   parallelized using a message passing interface, which greatly reduces
   the overall computation time for routine clinical practice. To test this
   approach, treatment for 10 patients with paranasal sinus cancer was
   planned using a total of 5 beams from a pool of 46 possible beam angles.
   The PMBAO treatment plans were also compared with IMRT plans designed
   using 9 equally spaced coplanar beams, which is the standard approach in
   our clinic. Plans with these two different beam configurations were
   compared with respect to dose conformity, dose heterogeneity,
   dose-volume histograms, and doses to organs at risk (i.e., eyes, optic
   nerve, optic chiasm, and brain).
   Results: The noncoplanar beam configuration was superior in most
   paranasal sinus carcinoma cases. The target A-osehomogeneity was better
   using a PMBAO 5-beam configuration. However, the dose conformity using
   PMBAO was not improved and was case dependent. Compared with the 9-beam
   configuration, the PMBAO configuration significantly reduced the mean
   dose to the eyes and optic nerves and the maximum dose to the
   contralateral optical path (e.g. the contralateral eye and optic nerve).
   The maximum dose to the ipsilateral eye and optic nerve was also lower
   using the PMBAO configuration than using the 9-beam configuration,
   although this difference was not significant. The mean doses to the
   optic chiasm and brain are marginally lower using the PMBAO
   configuration than using 9-beam configuration. The maximum doses to the
   optic chiasm and brain are the same with the PMBAO configuration and the
   9-beam configuration.
   Conclusion: Parallelized multiple-resolution beam angle optimization
   with an optimized noncoplanar beam configuration is an effective and
   practical approach for IMRT treatment planning. Five-beam treatment
   plans optimized using the PMBAO are at least equivalent to, and overall
   better than, the plans using 9 equally spaced coplanar beams. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{By simultaneously tracking pairs of specific genetic regions and
   divisome proteins in live Escherichia coli, we develop a new scheme for
   the relationship between DNA replication-segregation, chromosome
   organization, and cell division. A remarkable asymmetric pattern of
   segregation of different loci in the replication termination region
   (ter) suggests that individual replichores segregate to distinct
   nucleoid positions, consistent with an asymmetric segregation of leading
   and lagging strand templates after replication. Cells growing with a
   generation time of 100 min are born with a nonreplicating chromosome and
   have their origin region close to mid-cell and their ter polar. After
   replication initiation, the two newly replicated origin regions move
   away from mid-cell to opposite cell halves. By mid-S phase, FtsZ forms a
   ring at mid-cell at the time of initiation of nucleoid separation; ter
   remains polar. In the latter half of S phase, ter moves quickly toward
   mid-cell. FtsK, which coordinates the late stages of chromosome
   segregation with cell division, forms a ring coincident with the FtsZ
   ring as S phase completes, similar to 50 min after its initiation. As
   ter duplicates at mid-cell, sister nucleoid separation appears complete.
   After initiation of invagination, the FtsZ ring disassembles, leaving
   FtsK to complete chromosome segregation and cytokinesis.}},

Abstract = {{Weight gain, leading to further morbidity and poor treatment compliance,
   is a common adverse effect of treatment with clozapine. The C825T
   polymorphism in the human G protein beta3 subunit gene has been noted to
   be associated with obesity, hypertension and coronary artery disease.
   Clozapine increases the level of G protein beta3 subunit in the rat
   striatum. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
   relationship between G protein beta3 polymorphisms and clozapine-induced
   body weight change in a Chinese population during long-term treatment.
   One hundred and thirty-four schizophrenic patients, who were treated
   with clozapine continuously (113.4 +/- 0.5 months), were genotyped for G
   protein beta3 subunit C825T polymorphism. None of these patients
   received second-generation antipsychotics before clozapine treatment.
   Body weight was monitored at baseline before clozapine treatment and at
   the endpoint after clozapine treatment. Patients with the TT type
   experienced significantly more weight gain (116.2 +/- 2.5\%) compared to
   those with CT (9.3 +/- 1.2\%) or CC types (5.5 +/- 2.4\%) after
   long-term clozapine treatment (P=0.003). Further stratification by
   gender demonstrated that the effect of C825T polymorphism on weight gain
   remained significant both in males and females. These findings confirm
   the importance of genetic factors in body weight change induced by
   long-term clozapine treatment in patients with schizophrenia, and
   indicate a role for the G protein beta3 subunit in body weight
   regulation during long-term clozapine treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Heterocyclic derivatives of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are
   often significant components of environmental contaminant mixtures;
   however, their contribution to the toxicity of these mixtures is not
   well characterized. These heterocycles commonly co-occur in PAH
   mixtures, which contain agonists for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
   (AHR). Our goal for these studies was to explore the effects of two PAH
   heterocycles, carbazole (CB) and dibenzothiophene (DBT), alone and in
   combination with a PAH-type agonist for the AHR (beta-naphthoflavone
   {[}BNF]) on AHR-mediated cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) activity and on fish
   embryotoxicity. Embryos of Fundulus heteroclitus were exposed to CB or
   DBT, with and without coexposure to BNF Carbazole alone slightly
   induced, whereas DBT alone slightly reduced, in ovo CYP1A-mediated
   ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity compared to control values.
   However, exposure to CB or DBT reduced in ovo EROD activity in embryos
   coexposed to BNF Carbazole and DBT were characterized in vitro as
   noncompetitive CYP1A inhibitors. Carbazole and DBT enhanced the
   embryotoxicity of BNF, although neither compound was embryotoxic by
   itself. The co-occurrence of CB and DBT with PAH-type AHR inducers in
   contaminated ecosystems may increase the toxicity of PAH-type AHR
   agonists in these settings and may need to be considered when estimating
   the embryotoxicity of PAH mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: To determine whether decreased serum insulin-like growth
   factor-1 (IGF-1) levels could be a risk factor for dementia in older
   people.
   DESIGN: Case control study.
   SETTING: Showa University Karasuyama Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.
   PARTICIPANTS: A total of 436 Japanese elderly subjects: 106 patients
   with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 103 patients with vascular dementia
   (VaD), and 227 age-matched controls without dementia.
   MEASUREMENTS: Serum concentrations of IGF-1 and atherogenic
   lipoproteins, carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), and plaques
   were determined.
   RESULTS: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were positively
   correlated with serum IGF-1 concentrations as well as mean blood
   pressure or body mass index and were negatively correlated with age,
   serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a)
   concentrations, and carotid IMT. Serum IGF-1 concentrations had a
   significant inverse correlation with carotid IMT. Analysis across the
   IGF-1 quartiles revealed a threshold effect of low IGF-1 on MMSE score
   in subjects with the IGF-1 levels of 140 ng/mL or less (50\% percentile)
   versus those with IGF-1 levels greater than 140 ng/mL. Multiple logistic
   regression concerning AD and VaD retained serum IGF-1 concentrations of
   140 ng/mL or less and carotid IMT of 0.9 mm or more. Patients with AD
   and VaD had significantly lower IGF-1 concentrations and greater mean
   IMT than nondemented controls.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that decreased serum IGF-1 level and
   the progression of carotid atherosclerosis could play a role as
   independent risk factors for dementia.}},

   cells with beads conjugated with antibody against a cell type-specific
   cell-surface molecule, followed by nitrogen cavitated disruption,
   magnetic separation, and density gradient ultracentrifugation. We
   identified and quantified 339 human monocyte-derived DC transmembrane
   proteins, including 33 previously uncharacterized molecules. Whereas 106

Abstract = {{In Historied Thought, Constructed World, Joseph Margolis identifies the
   philosophical themes that will dominate philosophical discussions in the
   twenty-first century, given the recognition of the historicity of
   philosophical thought in the twentieth century. In what follows I
   examine these themes, especially cognitive intransparency, and the
   arguments presented in favor of them, noting the extent to which they
   rest on a view of language that takes a written text, and not speech, as
   the paradigm of language. I suggest if one takes speech as a mutual
   embodied action in a shared space as a model for language, the theme of
   cognitive intransparency-and the problems it brings in its wake-does not
   loom so large for those of us working in the history of philosophy. I
   conclude by showing that if we adopt this suggestion in relation to
   early Greek philosophy, that is, the period in the history of historied
   thought in which philosophy itself emerges as a linguistic and
   intellectual activity, we can better understand how and why philosophy
   emerged as it did-in the form of dialogues by Plato.}},

Abstract = {{A major limitation to overall success in peripheral nerve surgery is
   time for regeneration. Although one can help speed up the regenerative
   process to some extent, success is hindered by issues such as number of

   substitutes. In the case of a large gap, a nerve graft is often used to
   fill in the deficit. Autogenous nerve grafts are in limited supply, with
   sural nerve grafts being the primary source. Alternatives to the
   standard treatment include vein grafts, synthetic nerve conduits, nerve
   transfers, and nerve transplantation. Schwann cell-lined nerve conduits
   and tissue-engineered substitutions are still in their infancy and have

Abstract = {{In this work, the distribution of organic carbon, DNA and lipids in the

   profile in pore water. The contents of organic carbon in the sediments
   range from 23.3 to 76.8 mg(.)g(-1), with the peak value appearing at the
   depth of 8 cm bellow the sediments water interface (SWI), and tend to
   decrease gradually with sedimentation depth. The concentrations of SO42-
   decreased from 40.50 mg(.)L(-1) to 12.00 mg(.)L(-1) at SWI in top 4 cm
   sediment, and was kept at 12.0 mg(.)L(-1) bellow that depth. Newly
   produced organic carbon can be conserved as long as 14 years in the
   sediments. The contents of DNA were relatively high in top 9 cm surface
   sediments, as revealed by agarose gel images, close to those of organic
   carbon and sulphate reduction index (SRI). This study shows that
   bacteria played an important role in organic matter degradation; SO42-
   is the primary electron acceptor under anaerobic condition in this

Abstract = {{A 20-GHz low-noise amplifier (LNA) with an active balun fabricated in a
   0.25-mu m SiGe BICMOS (f(t) = 47 GHz) technology was presented by the
   authors in 2004. The LNA achieves close to 7 dB of gain and a noise
   figure of 4.9 dB with all ports simultaneously matched to 50 Omega with
   better than -16 dB of return loss. The amplifier is highly linear with
   an IP1dB of 0 dBm and IIP3 of 9 dBm, while consuming 14 mA of quiescent
   current from a 3.3-V rail, with temperature-compensated biasing. To the
   authors' knowledge, the LNA delivers the lowest reported noise figure
   and highest linearity for a silicon implementation of a combined active
   balun and LNA at 20 GHz, and is the first implementation of an active
   balun with an LC degenerated emitter-coupled pair. Here we expand on
   that work, with an analysis of the balun operation and noise
   optimization of the design.}},

Abstract = {{gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a psychotropic compound endogenous to the
   brain. Despite its potentially great physiological significance, its
   exact molecular mechanism of action is unknown. GHB is a weak agonist at
   GABA(B) receptors, but there is also evidence of specific GHB receptor
   sites, the molecular cloning of which remains a challenge. Ligands with
   high affinity and specificity for the reported GHB binding site are
   needed for pharmacological dissection of the GHB and GABA(B) effects and
   for mapping the structural requirements of the GHB receptor-ligand
   interactions. For this purpose, we have synthesized and assayed three
   conformationally restricted GHB analogs for binding against the
   GHB-specific ligand {[}H-3]NCS-382
   {[}(E,RS)-(6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5-hydroxy-5H-benzocyclohept-6-ylidene)acet
   ic acid] in rat brain homogenate. The cyclohexene and cyclopentene
   analogs, 3-hydroxycyclohex-1-enecarboxylic acid {[}(RS)-HOCHCA] and
   3-hydroxycyclopent-1-enecarboxylic acid {[}(RS)-HOCPCA], were found to
   be high-affinity GHB ligands, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range,
   and had 9 and 27 times, respectively, higher affinity than GHB. The
   stereo-selectively synthesized R, R-isomer of the trans-cyclopropyl GHB
   analog, HOCPrCA, proved to have 10-fold higher affinity than its
   enantiomer. Likewise, the R-enantiomers of HOCHCA and HOCPCA selectively
   inhibited {[}H-3]NCS-382 binding. The best inhibitor of these, (R)-
   HOCPCA, has an affinity 39 times higher than GHB and is thus among the
   best GHB ligands reported to date. Neither of the cycloalkenes showed
   any affinity (IC50 > 1 mM) for GABA(A) or GABA(B) receptors. These
   compounds show excellent potential as lead structures and novel tools
   for studying specific GHB receptor-mediated pharmacology.}},

Abstract = {{Low dimensionality is generally considered as a necessary ingredient for
   high superconducting transition temperatures. Surprisingly, perhaps,
   systems based on graphite(1-3) have received little attention in this
   context. Introducing metal atoms between the carbon layers can tune the
   interlayer spacing and charging of the graphite host through a variety
   of electronic ground states. One such ground state is superconductivity,
   which is not present in pure graphite. Here we report the discovery of
   superconductivity in the intercalation compounds C(6)Yb and C(6)Ca, with
   transition temperatures of 6.5 and 11.5 K, respectively. These critical
   temperatures are unprecedented in graphitic systems and have not been
   explained by a simple phonon mechanism for the superconductivity. This
   discovery has already stimulated several proposals for the
   superconducting mechanism(4-6) that range from coupling by way of the
   intercalant phonons through to acoustic plasmons. It also points towards
   the potential of superconductivity in systems such as carbon nanotubes.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{167}},

Pages = {{947-957}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Retinoic acid (RA), an active metabolite of vitamin A, plays a critical
   role in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and
   differentiation. RA action is primarily mediated through its receptors,
   ligand-dependent transcription factors of the steroid/thyroid/ vitamin D
   nuclear receptor superfamily. Recent studies indicate that
   administration of RA mitigates progressive kidney disease, underscoring
   its reno-protective potential. In this study, we investigated the
   effects of 9-cis-RA on glomerular mesangial cell activation induced by
   transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 using an in vitro cell culture
   system. In human mesangial cells 9-cis-RA suppressed TGF-beta 1-induced
   a-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, and plasminogen activator
   inhibitor-1 expression, but it did not significantly affect cell
   proliferation and survival. Interestingly, 9-cis-RA induced hepatocyte
   growth factor (HGF) mRNA expression and protein secretion, stimulated
   HGF promoter activity, and activated c-met receptor phosphorylation.
   Similar to HGF, 9-cis-RA induced expression of the Smad transcriptional
   corepressor TGIF in mesangial cells. Overexpression of exogenous TGIF by
   transfection or 9-cis-RA treatment suppressed trans-activation of the
   TGF-beta-responsive promoter. Moreover, conditional ablation of the cmet
   receptor completely abolished the anti-fibrotic effect of 9-cis-RA and
   abrogated TGIF induction. Collectively, these results indicate that
   9-cis-RA possesses anti-fibrotic ability by antagonizing TGF-beta 1 in
   mesangial cells and that 9-cis-RA activity is likely mediated through a
   mechanism dependent on HGF/c-met receptor signaling.}},

   reasons against performing the behavior. Logistic regression results
   from 224 job searchers (mean age 27.9 years) indicated that attribute

   measured job search behavior. Reason variables explained 15 per cent of
   the variance in behavior, which represents a significant increment in
   prediction over and above that explained by the attribute importance
   method. Moreover, the reason method was able to identify several

Abstract = {{A study of the two-dimensional incompressible flow of the solar wind
   past an open terrestrial magnetosphere is presented. The plasma is
   described by the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations including non-ideal
   effects such as resistivity and viscosity. The theoretical analysis is
   based on an ordinary perturbation technique with expansion in orders of
   large Reynolds and Lundqvist numbers. Magnetic reconnection is assumed
   to occur at an arbitrary point along a region If the magnetopause,
   stretching from the sub-solar point to the north. From the analysis we
   find analytical solutions describing the transition layers north and
   south of a reconnection point. It is shown that the transition layer
   north of the reconnection point is thinner than the layer on the south
   side. It is also shown that in order for steady reconnection to occur,
   the velocity at the reconnection point must be, less than the Alfven
   velocity. Using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we match
   the transition layer solution with a potential flow solution describing,
   the, flow and magnetic field in the exterior magnetosheath.}},

Abstract = {{Because optimal overload-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy requires
   ANG II, we aimed to determine the effects of blocking ANG II production
   {[}via angiotens-inconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibition] on potential
   mediators of hypertrophy in overloaded skeletal muscle, namely,
   myonuclear addition and fibroblast content. In a 2 x 2 design, adult
   (200-225 g) female Sprague-Dawley rats were placed into one of four
   groups (n = 8/group): 7-day skeletal muscle overload, sham operation,
   7-day skeletal muscle overload with ACE inhibition, or sham operation
   with ACE inhibition. Functional overloads of the plantaris and soleus
   muscles were produced via bilateral surgical ablation of the synergistic
   gastrocnemius muscle, and ACE inhibition was accomplished by the
   addition of the ACE inhibitor enalapril maleate to the animals' daily
   drinking water (0.3 mg/ml). Myonuclear addition and extrasarcolemmal
   nuclear proliferation, as measured by in vivo 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine
   labeling, were significantly (P <= 0.05) increased by overload in both
   the slow-twitch soleus and fast-twitch plantaris muscles. Furthermore,
   ACE inhibition attenuated these overload-induced increases in the soleus
   muscle but not in the plantaris muscle. However, the effect of ACE
   inhibition on soleus extrasarcolemmal nuclei was not likely due to
   differences in fibroblast content because overload elicited significant
   increases in vimentin-positive areas in soleus and plantaris muscles,
   and these areas were unaffected by ACE inhibition in either muscle.
   There was no effect of ACE inhibition on any measure in sham-operated
   muscles. Collectively, these data indicate that ANG II may mediate the
   satellite cell response to overload in slow-twitch soleus but not in
   fast-twitch plantaris muscles and that this effect may occur
   independently of changes in fibroblast content.}},

Abstract = {{Two preservative treatments traditionally used in aquatic sciences,
   formalin (4\%) and ethanol (70\%), were compared for their effects on
   biomass estimations. The effects of both preservatives on wet weight,
   dry weight, and ash-free dry weight were determined for samples
   preserved for 10, 21, and 90 days. The effects were studied in four
   different macrofauna species commonly found in German estuaries:
   Heteromastus filiformis (Capitellidae, Polychaeta), Hediste diversicolor
   (Nereididae, Polychaeta), Corophium sp. (Amphipoda, Crustaceae), and
   Gammarus spp. (Amphipoda, Crustacea). The biomass estimates of preserved
   samples were compared with those of unpreserved samples. In all four
   species the loss in wet weight, dry weight, and ash-free dry weight was
   most pronounced within the first 10 days, and an additional weight loss
   was recorded between days 10 and 21. However, there was no further loss
   in weight for samples kept for as long as 90 days in the preservatives.
   In general, crustaceans exhibited higher weight loss than polychaetes,
   and smaller species (H. filiformis and Corophium sp.) showed higher
   weight loss and a higher variability than larger species. As our main
   result, significant differences between the two preservative treatments
   did never occur. Our results contradict some earlier investigations on
   this matter where formalin has been reported to be superior to alcoholic
   preservatives because weight loss was less pronounced than in ethanol.
   Factors affecting biomass estimates are discussed and we conclude that,
   for the macrofauna groups tested, the use of the toxic formalin solution
   is not justified when the major intent is biomass estimation.}},

Abstract = {{This research aims at developing an integrated decision support system
   for the optimization of waste incinerator siting problems. In this
   integrated approach, both expert system and operations research
   techniques are used to model the siting problems of waste incinerator.
   Furthermore, an expert decision support system (EDSS) is implemented for
   the above problem and thus providing the decision makers a useful tool
   for decision-making. This EDSS is based on multi-criteria decision
   analysis in finding the best incinerator site by minimizing costs and
   environmental impacts. The proposed approach identifies a hierarchy of
   objectives for the siting problem. First of all, several potential sites
   need to be screened as a set of feasible alternative sites. Second,
   those alternative feasible sites will be further evaluated via the
   multi-criteria decision making methods. For the evaluation process, we
   solve a 0/1 combinatorial optimization problem at the upper level and
   proceed the multi-attribute utility function at the lower level to get
   the optimal solutions.- An empirical application of a real world waste
   incinerator site selection existing in Taichung City, Taiwan is followed
   in the end. Computational results both of the cost minimization and of
   the whole systems are also provided. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Glomerular injury and proteinuria in diabetes (types 1 and 2) and IgA
   nephropathy is related to the degree of podocyte depletion in humans.
   For determining the causal relationship between podocyte depletion and
   glomerulosclerosis, a transgenic rat strain in which the human
   diphtheria toxin receptor is specifically expressed in podocytes was
   developed. The rodent homologue does not act as a diphtheria toxin (DT)
   receptor, thereby making rodents resistant to DT. Injection of DT into
   transgenic rats but not wild-type rats resulted in dose-dependent
   podocyte depletion from glomeruli. Three stages of glomerular injury
   caused by podocyte depletion were identified: Stage 1, 0 to 20\%
   depletion showed mesangial expansion, transient proteinuria and normal
   renal function; stage 2, 21 to 40\% depletion showed mesangial
   expansion, capsular adhesions (synechiae), focal segmental
   glomerulosclerosis, mild persistent proteinuria, and normal renal
   function; and stage 3, >40\% podocyte depletion showed segmental to
   global glomerulosclerosis with sustained high-grade proteinuria and
   reduced renal function. These pathophysiologic consequences of podocyte
   depletion parallel similar degrees of podocyte depletion,
   glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria seen in diabetic glomerulosclerosis.
   This model system provides strong support for the concept that podocyte
   depletion could be a major mechanism driving glomerulosclerosis and
   progressive loss of renal function in human glomerular diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify risk factors for operation-specific Outcomes of
   pediatric cricotracheal resection (CTR).
   Design: We identified the first 100 consecutive children undergoing CTR
   at our institution from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 2004.
   Retrospective review of medical records provided data on demographics,
   operation dates, decannulation dates, and proposed risk factors,
   including age, stenosis grade, vocal cord function, Down syndrome,
   history of distal tracheal surgery, history of open laryngotracheal
   surgery, presence of tracheotomy at the time of operation, use
   of,suprahyoid release, extended CTR, and use of chin-to-chest sutures.
   Complete data sets were available for 93 patients.: We performed
   multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify significant
   independent risk factors.
   Setting: A tertiary care children's hospital.
   Patients: All patients younger than 18 years who underwent CTR at our
   institution.
   Main Outcome Measures: Operation-specific and overall decannulation
   rates.
   Results: Results of the preoperative evaluation showed grade III or IV
   stenosis in 89 patients (96\%). The overall decannulation rate included
   87 patients (94\%); the operation-specific decannulation rate, 66
   patients (71\%). The only significant risk factor for failure to
   decannulate after 1 operation was the presence of unilateral or
   bilateral vocal cord paralysis (P=.007).
   Conclusions: Cricotraceal resection may be safely performed in patients
   with multiple airway lesions. Patients with a history of vocal cord
   paralysis who undergo CTR often require more than I open airway
   procedure for decannulation and should be counseled appropriately. This
   study represents the largest reported series of pediatric CTR.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of a watershed model to mimic specified watershed processes
   is assessed through the calibration and validation process. The Soil and
   Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model was implemented in the
   Beaver Reservoir Watershed of Northwest Arkansas. The objectives were
   to: (1) provide detailed information on calibrating and applying a
   multisite and multivariable SWAT model; (2) conduct sensitivity
   analysis; and (3) perform calibration and validation at three different
   sites for flow, sediment, total phosphorus (TP), and nitrate-nitrogen
   (NO3-N) plus nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N). Relative sensitivity analysis was
   conducted to identify parameters that most influenced predicted flow,
   sediment, and nutrient model outputs. A multiobjective function was
   defined that consisted of optimizing three statistics: percent relative
   error (RE), Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient (R-NS(2)), and coefficient of
   determination (R-2). This function was used to successfully calibrate
   and validate a SWAT model of Beaver Reservoir Watershed at multisites
   while considering multivariables. Calibration and validation of the
   model is a key factor in reducing uncertainty and increasing user
   confidence in its predictive abilities, which makes the application of
   the model effective. Information on calibration and validation of
   multisite, multivariable SWAT models has been provided to assist
   watershed modelers in developing their models to achieve watershed

Abstract = {{AIM: A rapid assessment stroke clinic (RASC) was established to provide
   a rapid diagnostic service to individuals with suspected transient
   cerebral or ocular ischaemia or recovered non-hospitatized strokes. In
   this report we-review imaging findings and clinical outcomes of patients
   proceeding to the carotid surgery programme.
   METHODS: Between October 2000 and December 2002, 1339 people attended
   the RASC. The findings of head CT and carotid Doppler ultrasound of the
   1320 patients who underwent brain and carotid imaging were reviewed, and
   the number subsequently proceeding to carotid angiography and
   intervention was reported.,
   RESULTS: CT head scans were normal in 57\% of cases; 38\% demonstrated
   ischaemia or infarction; and 3\% yielded incidental or other significant
   findings not related to ischaemia. On screening with carotid Doppler
   ultrasound, 7.5\% showed greater than 50\% stenosis on the symptomatic
   side. A total of 83 patients (6.2\%) proceeded to cerebral angiography
   and 65 (4.8\%) underwent carotid endarterectomy or endovascular repair.
   CONCLUSION: Rapid-access neurovascular clinics are efficient in
   selecting patients for carotid intervention, but this is at a cost and
   the number of potential strokes prevented is small. Alternative
   management pathways based on immediate medical treatment need to be
   evaluated. (c) 2005 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by

Abstract = {{The processes taking place during supersaturation of the Al-4.7mass\%Cu
   alloy have been studied by the methods of quantitative metallography and
   dilatometry. The grain growth activation energy was about 95 kJ/mol, and
   the exponent of time, n, was close to 0.4. Dissolution of precipitates
   caused two-stage shrinkage of the sample, which had activation energies
   of 90 kJ/mol (first stage, n = 0.8) and 63 kJ/mol (second stage, n =
   0.4). The kinetics of the phase transformation during aging of the
   Al-4.7mass\%Cu alloy has been studied by the dilatometry and
   differential thermal analysis The activation energy of the precipitation
   processes within the range of 50-320 degrees C varied between 50 and 100
   kJ/mol and confirmed the results obtained previously. For the
   precipitation processes within the range of 320-462 degrees C, the
   activation energy varied from 226 to 300 kJ/mol. The results obtained
   were compared with literature data with good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{DC plasma jet CVD is applied to synthesize coatings from liquid state
   single source precursors on metallic substrates. For SiBCN coating
   synthesis hexamethylcyclotrisilazanoboranes with Si/B ratio 3:1, 3:2 and
   3:3 are used. SiCNTi coatings are produced with tris(dimethylamino)and
   tris(diethylamino)hexamethylcyclotrisilazanotitanium. Attempts to
   deposit SiCNZr coatings by use of
   tris(diethylamino)hexamethylcyclotrisilazanozironium are not successful
   due to too high precursor viscosity. Vacuum plasma sprayed nickel,
   molybdenum and copper interlayers prove to permit effective suppression
   of nitride and boride reaction zone formation, which is observed during
   direct SiBCN coating deposition on mild steel substrates. By use of
   adapted process parameters coatings with columnar or dense morphology
   and amorphous or nanocrystalline structure can be synthesized.
   Deposition rates exceeding 2000 mu m/h are achieved. By relative
   movement between DC plasma torch and substrate surface the coated area
   is enlarged. Simultaneous improvement of coating density and homogeneity
   is observed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with chronic viral infections such as HIV/AIDS or hepatitis C
   often have multiple co-existing problems such as psychiatric and
   addictive disorders, as well as social problems such as lack of housing,
   transportation and income that present challenging obstacles to
   successful management. Because services for these different problems are
   usually provided by different disciplines in varying locations,
   fragmentation of care can lead to treatment dropouts, lack of adherence,
   and poor outcomes. Integration strategies, ranging from simple efforts
   to improve communication and coordinate care to fully integrated
   multidisciplinary teams have been used to improve disease management.
   Although evidence for effectiveness is comprised primarily of
   observational studies of demonstration programmes, integration may be
   desirable on a pragmatic basis alone. Quality improvement strategies are
   attractive vehicles for implementing care integration and measuring its
   impact. Careful assessment of the problem to be solved and the
   development of targeted strategies will maximize chances of a successful
   outcome. (c) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropologists since Malinowski have noted the unintelligibility of
   many types of ritual and magical speech. What has not been sufficiently

   of what makes rituals efficacious and accounts for their impact on
   social life. This paper compares two genres of Lucumi ritual speech in
   Cuban Santeria, songs and possession trance speech, to argue that
   unintelligibility is produced through different semiotic and
   metasemiotic processes in each case. Even within the same ritual
   register, unintelligibility can be performed differently, and its

Abstract = {{This study investigated predictors of job satisfaction and builds on

   institutions and background characteristics up to 25 years earlier. With
   statistical controls for demographic, socioeconomic, and academic
   characteristics, a final sample of 2515 college graduates was used to
   test hypotheses centered on the possibility that a causal order relates
   education and job satisfaction. Specifically, college degree majors,
   measures of both actual and perceived congruence, as well as income were
   examined in relation to three dimensions of job satisfaction. Results
   support hypotheses that income and congruence both mediate the effects
   of majors on job satisfaction, and identify that two different measures
   of congruence are causally related to intrinsic dimensions of job
   satisfaction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Amblyopes show bilateral loss of sensitivity for second-order (contrast
   defined) stimuli that can be further suppressed by flanking second-order
   stimuli (whereas flanks facilitate sensitivity in normal observers). The
   suppressive flank effect in amblyopes might be explained by abnormal
   pooling of second-order contrast across visual space. In this study, we
   investigate whether amblyopes show abnormal second-order spatial
   summation by measuring contrast detection thresholds for 1 c/deg
   modulations of random noise (stimuli 1-12 cycles) in amblyopic
   observers, strabismic observers with no visual acuity loss, and normal
   (control) observers. Non-control observers showed substantial bilateral
   loss of sensitivity relative to the control observers, as expected.
   However, all observers showed essentially equal second-order spatial
   summation: contrast detection threshold decreased with approximately the
   square root of the number of cycles, and then became independent of size
   at 6-8 cycles (similar asymptotes). We conclude that the pooling of
   second-order contrast across visual space is unaffected by amblyopia.

Abstract = {{Background Although smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular
   disease, it has been suggested that Asians may be less susceptible to
   the adverse effects of smoking than Caucasians. This may have
   contributed to the high prevalence of smoking, and the low quitting
   rates, in Asian men. Worldwide, smoking rates are increasing for women,
   amongst whom cardiovascular awareness is relatively poor.
   Methods An individual participant data analysis of 40 cohort studies was
   carried out, involving 463 674 Asians (33\% female) and 98 664
   Australasians (45\% female). Cox proportional hazard models, stratified
   by study and sex where appropriate, were employed.
   Results The HR {[}95\% confidence interval (CI)], comparing current
   smokers with non-smokers, for coronary heart disease (CHD) was 1.60
   (1.49-1.72); haemorrhagic stroke 1.19 (1.06-1.33); ischaemic stroke 1.38
   (1.24-1.54). There was a clear dose-response relationship between the
   number of cigarettes smoked per day and both CHD and stroke, with no
   significant difference (P >= 0.20) between populations from Asia and
   Australia/New Zealand. Although there was no sex difference for stroke
   in the effect of amount smoked (P = 0.16), for CHD, women tended to have
   higher hazard ratios than men (P = 0.011). Quitting gave a clear
   benefit, which was not significantly different between the sexes or
   regions (P > 0.63). The HR (CI) for ex-smokers compared with current
   smokers was 0.71 (0.64-0.78) for CHD and 0.84 (0.76-0.92) for stroke.
   Conclusions Unless urgent public health measures are put into place, the
   impact of the smoking epidemic in Asia, and among women, will be
   enormous. Tobacco control policies that specifically target these
   populations are essential.}},

Abstract = {{Detectable exciton couplets arising from heme-heme interactions in the
   hemoglobin (Hb) tetramers of HbO(2) and deoxyHb were predicted by DeVoe
   theory (Woody, in: Optical properties and structure of tetrapyrroles.
   Berlin: Walter deGruyter \& Co.; 1985. p 239-259). This prediction was
   supported by the observation of an exciton couplet in the CD difference
   spectrum between the Hb tetramer and the alpha beta dimer of HbCO
   (Goldbeck et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1997;235:610-614). In this
   paper, DeVoe theory is used to calculate the heme-heme interactions in
   the CO complex of the Hb tetramer (alpha(2)beta(2)) and dimer (alpha
   beta), the systems studied by Goldbeck et al. The couplet strength of
   the resulting theoretical CD difference spectrum agrees well with
   experiment, thus confirming that heme-heme interactions contribute
   significantly to the CD of HbCO. Given that the heme-heme distances in
   HbCO are 25 A and more, it is highly likely that heme-heme interactions
   also contribute significantly to the CD of other multi-heme proteins,
   e.g., cytochrome c(3), cytochrome oxidase, cytochrome bc(1), etc., where
   the hemes are in closer proximity. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The main goal of this study was to test whether the
   hypothesized cardinal symptom of euphoria results in differences in
   clinical correlates in bipolar youth ascertained with no a priori
   assumptions about cardinal symptoms.
   Methods: Subjects (n = 86) satisfying DSM-IV criteria,for bipolar
   disorder with and without the proposed cardinal symptom of euphoria were
   compared in their bipolar symptom pattern, functioning and patterns of
   comorbidity.
   Results: Among Criterion A (abnormal mood), we found that severe
   irritability was the predominant abnormal mood rather than euphoria
   (94\% vs. 51\%). We also found that among Criterion B items, grandiosity
   was not uniquely over represented in youth with mania, nor did the rate
   of grandiosity differ whether irritability or irritability and euphoria
   were the Criterion A mood symptom. Neither symptom profiled patterns of
   comorbidity nor measures of functioning differed related to the presence
   or absence of euphoria.
   Conclusions: These findings challenge the notion that euphoria
   represents a cardinal symptom of mania in children. Instead they support
   the clinical relevance of severe irritability as the most common
   presentation of mania in the young. They also support the use of
   unmodified DSM-IV criteria in establishing the diagnosis of mania in
   pediatric populations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine whether postoperative mechanical ventilation with
   lower tidal volumes (V-T) has protective effects on inflammatory
   responses induced by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery in smokers and
   nonsmokers. Design and setting: Prospective, randomized, controlled
   clinical trial in the intensive care unit of a university hospital.
   Patients and participants: We examined 44 patients (22 smokers, 22
   nonsmokers) immediately after uncomplicated CPB surgery. Interventions:
   Ventilation was applied for 6 h with either V-T of either 6 or 12 ml/kg
   ideal body weight. Measurements and results: The time course of serum
   tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, interleukin (IL) 6, and IL-8
   determined 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after randomization did not differ
   significantly between the ventilatory strategies. By contrast, in
   bronchoalveolar lavage fluids sampled after 6 h only TNF-alpha levels
   were significantly higher in the high V-T group than the low V-T group
   (50 +/- 111 pg/ml vs. 1 +/- 7 pg/ml). IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations did
   not differ between groups. Subgroup analysis of patients with serum
   TNF-alpha level higher than 0 pg/ml after surgery revealed lower
   TNF-alpha serum levels during lower V-T ventilation. All observed
   effects were small, independent of patients' history of smoking, and
   were not correlated with duration of ventilation and ICU stay.
   Conclusions: Ventilation with lower V-T had no or only minor effect on
   systemic and pulmonary inflammatory responses in patients with healthy
   lungs after uncomplicated CPB surgery. Our data do not suggest a
   clinical benefit of using low V-T ventilation in these selected
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{The reactive sintering of 3Ti/SiC/C to form the ternary carbide Ti3SiC2,
   previously found to involve the intermediate phases TiCx and Ti5Si3Cx,
   was investigated by time-resolved neutron powder diffraction. The
   kinetics of Ti3SiC2 formation from the intermediate phases TiCx Ti5Si3Cx
   (x <= 1) and a small amount of free C was determined. The
   crystallization rate of the Ti3SiC2 phase was determined through
   quantitative analyses of the diffraction patterns collected at different
   temperatures and is initially well-described by the Mehl-Avrami-Johnson
   equation. The activation energy was found to be 380 +/- 10 kj/mol and
   the Avrami exponent 3.0 +/- 0.2. The Avrami exponent decreases to close
   to I when more than half of the crystallization process was completed.
   This indicates a change in the mechanism of Ti3SiC2 crystal growth from
   unrestricted two or three-dimensional growth in the a-b planes to
   one-dimensional growth only, due to interaction of the growing,disk-like
   crystals and cessation of growth in the preferred direction. (c) 2004

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In order to combine silicon technology with the functionality of
   magnetic systems, a number of ferromagnetic (FM) materials have been
   suggested for the fabrication of metal/semiconductor heterojunctions. In
   this work, we present a systematic study of several candidate materials
   in contact with the Si surface. We employ density-functional theory
   calculations to address the thermodynamic stability and magnetism of
   both pseudomorphic CsCl-like M Si (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) thin films and
   Heusler alloy M2MnSi (M=Fe, Co, Ni) films on Si(001). Our calculations
   show that Si termination of the M Si films is energetically preferable
   during epitaxy since it minimizes the energetic cost of broken bonds at
   the surface. Moreover, we can explain the calculated trends in
   thermodynamic stability of the M Si thin films in terms of the M-Si bond
   strength and the M 3d orbital occupation. From our calculations, we
   predict that ultrathin MnSi films are FM with sizable spin magnetic
   moments at the Mn atoms, while FeSi and NiSi films are nonmagnetic.
   However, CoSi films display itinerant ferromagnetism. For the M2MnSi
   films with Heusler-type structure, the MnSi termination is found to have
   the highest thermodynamic stability. In the FM ground state, the
   calculated strength of the effective coupling between the magnetic
   moments of Mn atoms within the same layer approximately scales with the
   measured Curie temperatures of the bulk M2MnSi compounds. In particular,
   the Co2MnSi/Si(001) thin film has a robust FM ground state as in the
   bulk, and is found to be stable against a phase separation into
   CoSi/Si(001) and MnSi/Si(001) films. Hence this material is of possible
   use in FM-Si heterojunctions and deserves further experimental
   investigations.}},

   features such as simplicity, robustness, high efficiency, fairness, and
   quality of service capability. We evaluate SYN-MAC in terms of collision
   probability, system throughput, and packet delay, via both analysis and
   simulation. Our results show that, with properly chosen parameters,
   SYN-MAC can achieve a very low collision probability, packet delay
   tolerance, and extremely high channel efficiency (of > 90\%) under a
   wide range of traffic load. As a result, SYN-MAC may serve as an
   alternative to IEEE 802.11 for the wireless stations in synchronized

   extracellular matrixes such as collagens. However, the effect of
   latanoprost on corneal stromal cells is not well understood. In the
   current study, we investigated the changes of cultured porcine corneal
   stromal cells upon exposure to latanoprost. Methods : Porcine corneal
   stromal cells were acquired from primary culture and maintained in fetal
   bovine serum-containing medium. Cells were estimated on H-3-thymidine,
   H-3-leucine, H-3-uridine, H-3- proline uptakes and migration. Dead and
   living cells were estimated with MTT assay. The changes of type 1
   collagen and fibronectin proteins were detected by means of
   immunofluorescent staining and Western blot assay. Intracellular free
   Ca2+({[}Ca2+](i)) mobility was studied by spectrofluorophotometer after
   loading with fura-2-AM. Results : Latanoprost has remarkable effects
   inhibiting cultured corneal stromal cells on H-3-thymidine, H-3-leucine,
   H-3-uridine, H-3-proline uptakes and cellular migration. The inhibitory
   effects are in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from
   10(-5) , 10(-6) , 10(-7) to 10(-8) M. The 50\% inhibitory dosages (ID50)
   for latanoprost to corneal stromal cells, as measured by 3 H-thymidine
   uptake, 3 H-uridine uptake, 3 H-leucine uptake, 3 H-proline uptakes and
   cellular migration were 5.01 x 10(-6) M, 2.81 x 10(-) (6) M, 2.09 x
   10(-6) M, 3.89 x 10(-7) M and 2.2 x 10(-6) M, respectively. In the
   presence of latanoprost, the cellular MTT values were also decreased
   significantly. Immunofluorescent staining displayed that latanoprost
   changed type 1 collagen distribution in cultured corneal stromal cells.
   Western blot assay revealed that latanoprost caused cells to decrease in
   fibronectin protein. In Ca2+-containing buffer, latanoprost induced a
   significant rise in {[}Ca2+](i) at 10(-5) and 10(-6) M. Conclusions :
   These results indicate that latanoprost may induce the morphological and
   biochemical changes in cultured corneal stromal cells. Long-term use of
   latanoprost needs to be carefully monitored for change in corneal
   stroma.}},

   better-than-the-average, worse-than-the-average and

Abstract = {{The performance of a set of linear reduced-rank multistage filter banks
   is studied in the context of multiuser detection for direct-sequence
   (DS) code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems. The set of filter
   banks under consideration is comprised of the minimum mean-square error
   (MMSE), the minimum output energy (MOE), the best linear unbiased
   estimator (BLUE), and the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector. Based on a
   common framework for the multistage implementations of the
   aforementioned filter banks, the signal-to-interference plus noise
   ratios (SINRs) and bit-error rates (BERs) of these reduced-rank filter
   banks are studied for multipath Rayleigh-fading channels. A generic BER
   formula is provided for coherent detection and noncoherent differential
   detection schemes constructed under this common framework. Analysis
   shows that all of these performance measures are characterized by a
   kernel matrix K-mmse, whose trace forms the output SINR of the MMSE
   filter bank. Through investigating the recursive structure of K-mmse,
   the output SINRs are proven to be monotonically increasing with the
   number of stages and upper-bounded by a number equal to the paths of the
   desired user's channel. The condition for asymptotically achieving this
   upper bound is also provided, which leads to the notion of effective
   user capacity of linear reduced-rank multiuser detection as well as
   serves as a test for the existence of a BER floor for coherent
   detection. In addition, the channel mismatch due to differential
   detection is also shown to yield a BER floor for noncoherent detection.
   Based on this analysis, a simple yet effective rule for choosing the
   number of stages is provided for both coherent and noncoherent linear
   multistage multiuser detection.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal spectra of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) were collected

   Based on the changes of absorbance ratio corresponding to characteristic
   groups in low and high vibration energy states, the apparent enthalpy
   differences of vibration energy states transformation (Delta H-n) in the
   melting process have been calculated by van't Hoff equation at constant
   pressure. In comparison with the values of Delta H-n, the status of
   participation for the vibration mode of various characteristic groups in
   PTT macromolecular chain segments was analyzed. It was found that the
   vibration modes related to the trimethylene glycol unit (O-CH2-CH2CH2-O)
   of PTT behaved significant sensitivity and made prominent contribution
   in the melting process. By the summarization of corresponding data, it
   has shown that the melting course concerned amorphous phase began at as
   early as 218 degrees C, accompanied by the occurrence of crystallization
   to certain extent, and the ending point was at approximately 238 degrees
   C whereas the melting course concerned crystalline phase began till 228
   degrees C, with the top value of 238 degrees C, and ended at 242 degrees

Abstract = {{We study the performance of Monte Carlo simulations that sample a broad
   histogram in energy by determining the mean first-passage time to span
   the entire energy space of d-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising/Potts
   models. We first show that flat-histogram Monte Carlo methods with
   single-spin flip updates such as the Wang-Landau algorithm or the
   multicanonical method perform suboptimally in comparison to an unbiased
   Markovian random walk in energy space. For the d=1, 2, 3 Ising model,
   the mean first-passage time tau scales with the number of spins N=L-d as
   tau proportional to(NLz)-L-2. The exponent z is found to decrease as the
   dimensionality d is increased. In the mean-field limit of infinite
   dimensions we find that z vanishes up to logarithmic corrections. We
   then demonstrate how the slowdown characterized by z>0 for finite d can
   be overcome by two complementary approaches-cluster dynamics in
   connection with Wang-Landau sampling and the recently developed ensemble
   optimization technique. Both approaches are found to improve the random

Journal = {{LITHOS}},

Abstract = {{The fractionation of boron isotopes between synthetic boromuscovite and
   fluid was experimentally determined at 3.0 GPa/ 500 degrees C and 3.0
   GPa/700 degrees C. For near-neutral fluids A(11)B((mica-fluid)) = delta
   B-11((mica)) - delta B-11((fluid)) is - 10.9 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand
   at 500 degrees C, and -6.5 + 0.4 parts per thousand at 700 degrees C.
   This supports earlier assumptions that the main fractionation effect is
   due to the change from trigonal coordination of boron in neutral fluids
   to tetrahedrally coordinated boron in micas, clays and melts. The
   T-dependence of this effect is approximated by the equation Delta
   B-11((mica,clay,melt-neutral fluid)) = - 10.69(.)(1000/T {[}K]) +
   3.88-1; R-2 = 0.992, valid from 25 degrees C for fluid-clay up to about
   1000 degrees C for fluid-silicate melt. Experiments at 0.4 GPa that used
   strongly basic fluids produced significantly lower fiactionations with
   Delta B-11((mica-fluid)) of - 7.4 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand at 400
   degrees C, and -4.8 parts per thousand +/- 1.0 parts per thousand at 500
   degrees C, showing the reduced fractionation effect when large amounts
   of boron in basic fluids are tetrahedrally coordinated. Field studies
   have shown that boron concentrations and B-11/B-10-ratios in volcanic
   arcs systematically decrease across the arc with increasing distance
   from the trench, thus reflecting the thermal structure of the subducting
   slab. Our experiments show that the boron isotopic signature in volcanic
   arcs probably results from continuous dehydration of micas along a
   distinct P-T range. Continuous slab dehydration and boron transport via
   fluid into the mantle wedge is responsible for the boron isotopic
   signature in volcanic arcs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Seven-year-old apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) trees cv. `Braeburn' on
   rootstock M.26 were flower-thinned to establish four crop loads,
   resulting in final mean fruit numbers per tree of 0, 100, 225 and 400.
   Mean fruit mass decreased by about 35\% with each decrease in cropping
   density. Fruit from light-cropping trees had significantly advanced
   maturity as indicated by the harvest management criteria of background
   color and starch/iodine score, and other fruit quality characteristics
   such as soluble solids. Flesh firmness and dry matter also increased
   with decreasing crop load. Compared with fruiting trees, mean leaf
   photosynthetic rates of non-cropping trees were significantly lower
   (40\%) between 75 days after full bloom (dafb) and fruit harvest, with a
   maximum reduction of almost 60\% at 118 dafb. Photosynthetic activity
   decreased linearly with increasing concentration of leaf starch, but was
   positively and significantly related to stomatal conductance.
   Consequently, the accumulation of nonstructural carbohydrates in leaves
   of light-cropping or non-cropping trees may have led to end-product
   inhibition of photosynthesis. Increases in xanthophyll cycle carotenoids
   mediated non-radiative thermal energy dissipation in non-cropping trees,
   providing increased capacity for photoprotection but reducing
   photochemical efficiency.}},

   47\% (16/34) of specifically induced host genes were related to immunity

Pages = {{784-790}},

Abstract = {{Tanshinone IIA is a compound purified from the Chinese herb Danshen
   (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhiza Bge). The neuroprotective effect of
   tanshinone ITA was investigated in a neonatal rat model of
   hypoxia-ischermia brain damage. Hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy was
   induced in rats at day 7 of postnatal age by ligation of the right
   common carotid artery, followed by 2 h of hypoxia. Tanshinone IIA (10
   mg/kg, i.p.) was injected daily from day 2 before surgery for 9 or 16 d.
   Our results demonstrated significant and sustained brain damage in the
   hypoxia-ischemia- and vehicle-treated groups at 1 and 3 wk after
   surgery. Treatment with tanshinone IIA significantly reduced the
   severity of brain injury, as indicated by the increase in ipsilateral
   brain weight and neuron density, compared with those of sham-operated
   animals. The recovery of sensorimotor function and histology was
   observed in animals that received tanshinone IIA. The plasma of
   tanshinone IIA-treated rats exhibited higher antioxidant activities, as
   reflected by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay, compared with
   the vehicle-treated rats. In the neural progenitor cell line C17.2 that
   was subjected to 2,2'-azobis (2-amidino propane hydrochloride)-induced
   oxidative stress, tanshinone IIA increased cell viability and protected
   against mitochondrial damage (JC-1 assay). Our results suggest that
   tanshinone IIA has antioxidative activities and that treatment that is
   started before a hypoxic-ischemic insult is partially neuroprotective.
   Further studies are required to elucidate whether rescue treatment with
   tanshinone IIA is effective and to determine whether its protective
   effect is also associated with secondary cooling of the brain.}},

Abstract = {{The anntenna area of distributed micosateliites radar system is usually
   smaller than the minimum Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) antenna area

   this signal processing research is to develop processing approaches that
   exploit the added degrees of freedom of a spatially diverse formation to
   resolve inherent ambiguities of this sparse aperture distributed
   microsatellites radar system. This paper proposed a Doppler ambiguity
   resolving method which makes the Doppler ambiguities null in Doppler
   domain using spatial filter of multiple phase centres, this processing
   can be regard as a Space-time processing (STAP). This method first
   filters out each unambiguous frequency point from ambiguous Doppler
   channels of a few different phase centers by using spatial filter, then
   combines all unambiguous real frequency point to a whole unambiguous
   Doppler band, after that, finishes imaging processing. The theoretical
   derivation for along-track linear array and three dimensional array,
   performance analysis and simulation of the method are also given in the

Abstract = {{Protein expression profiles linked to sclerosis in the 5/6 nephrectomy
   (Nx) rat model of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis were investigated.
   Sections of control glomeruli from normal baseline Nx tissue and
   nonsclerotic and sclerotic glomeruli from 12 wk after 5/6 Nx were
   isolated by laser capture microdissection. Protein profiles were
   acquired directly by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Classification accuracy was 99.2\% for
   distinguishing normal versus sclerotic glomeruli and 96.7 and 97.8\% for
   nonsclerotic versus normal and sclerotic glomeruli, respectively. The
   proteomic pattern of the nonsclerotic glomeruli was more similar to
   sclerotic than normal glomeruli (P < 0.0001). Thymosin beta 4, a protein
   with relevant interactions with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
   angiogenesis, and wound healing, was identified as a key differentially
   expressed protein. Thymosin beta 4 immunostaining was increased in
   sclerotic glomeruli, predominantly in endothelial cells. Downregulation
   of thymosin beta 4 by RNAi in cultured glomerular endothelial cells
   decreased angiotensin II-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
   expression. In conclusion, proteomic patterns can accurately distinguish
   normal versus nonsclerotic versus sclerotic glomeruli. The closely
   related proteomic patterns of nonsclerotic and sclerotic glomeruli
   suggest early activation of prosclerotic mechanisms even in seemingly
   intact glomeruli. Thymosin beta 4 is a marker of such early events and
   may even contribute to sclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{Gallium-doped silicon nitride nanowires sheathed with amorphous silicon
   oxynitride have been prepared on silicon substrates using GaN as the

Abstract = {{Background Myocardial fibrosis is a major component of ventricular
   remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of the present
   study was to determine the outcome of transplantation into ischemic
   myocardium of bone marrow derived stem cell (MSC) on left ventricular
   (LV) function and remodeling, and to look closely at extracellular
   matrix gene expression.
   Methods and Results MI was induced by direct ligation of the left
   anterior descending coronary artery in rats, followed by MSC
   transplantation into the ischemic myocardium. Hemodynamic evaluations
   were performed at 7 and 28 days after coronary ligation. Changes in the
   mRNA expressions of collagen type I and type III, matrix
   metalloproteinase-1, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase
   (TIMP)-1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) were investigated
   using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ
   hybridization after MI. Heart/body weight ratio in the MI+MSC group
   decreased after coronary ligation. However, LV systolic pressure and LV
   peak velocities of contraction and relaxation significantly increased
   compared with the MI group (p<0.01). There was marked up-regulation of
   the mRNA expressions of collagen types I and III, TIMP-1 and TGF-beta(1)
   in the MI rats, all of which were significantly attenuated by MSC
   transplantation.
   Conclusions MSC transplantation could inhibit LV remodeling, improve
   heart function and reduce the expression of extracellular matrix genes.}},

   around 40 microns existed in the steel. Most of these bigger inclusions

Abstract = {{Wheat flour proteins were studied to identify the cultivar-specific
   proteins and use them to identify cultivars in flours. Proteins
   extracted from flours of Japanese wheat (cultivars Holcushin,
   Horoshirikomugi, Kitanokaori and Kachikei 33) and Canadian wheat (Canada
   Western Red Spring Wheat No. 1; 1CW) were analyzed by 2-DE with IEF gels
   over three pH ranges: PH 4-7, pH 5-8, and pH 6-11. This system enabled
   detection of more than 1600 protein spots. We recognized that among 50
   protein spots showing cultivar-dependent qualitative changes, 25
   proteins were wheat cultivar specific. These 50 protein spots were
   analyzed by N-terminal Edman degradation microsequencing and
   MALDI-TOF-MS; 21 protein spots were storage proteins, such as gliadin
   and low-molecular mass glutenin subunit. Five protein spots were
   identified as dehydroascorbate reductase (Triticum aestivum), triticin
   precursor (T aestivum), alpha-arnylase inhibitor (Oryza sativa),
   DNA-binding with one finger (Doo zinc family protein (O. sativa), and
   nonphototropic hypocotyl 1 (NPH1) protein (Avena sativa). The other
   protein spots appeared to be hypothetical proteins (O. sativa or
   Arabidopsis thaliana) or functional unknown proteins. These specific
   proteins can be used as markers to identify wheat cultivars in blended
   flour composed of two or three flours.}},

   of GSH by preloading of diethyl maleate (DEM) which depletes cellular
   GSH. Similar decreased uptake was also observed in the distribution of
   L-{[}1-C-14]ascorbic acid (C-14-AA) after DEM treatment. The possible
   biological mechanisms, including competition with endogenous AA and

Abstract = {{The resultant thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of M/T/M (M=Cu or Ni and
   T=Bi0.88Sb0.12) composite materials welded with Bi-Sb alloy was measured
   at 298 K as a function of relative thickness of Bi-Sb alloy and compared
   with ZT values calculated by treating it as an electrical and thermal
   circuit. It was first clarified experimentally that the observed ZT
   values of composite materials have a local maximum at an optimum volume
   fraction (corresponding to the thickness) of Bi-Sb alloy in spite of
   macroscopic composite materials, owing to a significant enhancement in
   the Seebeck coefficient. It is sure that the enhancement in alpha is
   caused by the boundary Seebeck coefficient generated at the interface
   between Bi-Sb alloy and a metal. It was thus clarified that the
   interface effect appears clearly in macroscopic systems. The observed
   maximum ZT values at 298 K reached a surprisingly great value of 0.44 at
   a relative thickness of approximately 0.7, which corresponds to
   approximately 1.7 times as large as 0.26 of Bi0.88Sb0.12 alloy and to
   about half of 0.8-0.9 of commercially utilized bismuth telluride
   compounds. So enhanced ZT may not be utilizable for a Peltier module,
   but is available for generators. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{A novel objective no-reference metric is proposed for video quality
   assessment of digitally coded videos containing natural scenes. Taking
   account of the temporal dependency between adjacent images of the videos
   and characteristics of the human visual system, the spatial distortion
   of an image is predicted using the differences between the corresponding
   translational regions of high spatial complexity in two adjacent images,
   which are weighted according to temporal activities of the video. The
   overall video quality is measured by pooling the spatial distortions of
   all images in the video. Experiments using reconstructed video sequences
   indicate that the objective scores obtained by the proposed metric agree
   well with the subjective assessment scores.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to develop a decision-feedback equalizer
   (DFE) using a fixed set of parameters applicable to most shallow oceans
   with minimal user supervision (i.e., a turn key system). This work is
   motivated by the superior performance {[}bit error rate (BER)] of the
   multichannel DFE compared, with other methods, such as passive-phase
   conjugation (PPC), at the same time noting its sensitivity to different
   acoustic environments. The approach is to couple PPC, utilizing its
   adaptability to different environments, with a single-channel DFE. This
   coupling, forms an optimal processor for acoustic communications in
   theory, but it has never been implemented in practice. By coupling with
   DFE, the method achieves the same spatial diversity as conventional
   multichannel DFE, without requiring a large number of receivers as does
   PPC. The correlation-based DFE in terms of the antocorrelation functions
   of the channel impulse responses summed over the receiver channels (the
   Q function) is derived. This paper shows in terms of waveguide physics,
   further supported by real data, the many desirable features of the Q
   function that suggest, given adequate sampling of the water column, a
   general applicability of the correlation-based equalizer to different
   environments, irrespective of the sound speed profiles, bottom
   properties, and source-receiver ranges/depths. This property can be
   expected to hold approximately for a small number of receivers with
   spatial diversity. This paper demonstrates the robustness of the new
   equalizer with moving source data despite the range change (which
   modifies the impulse response) and symbol phase change due to
   time-varying Doppler.}},

Abstract = {{The sharing of tunable wavelength converters (TWCs) is widely believed
   as a feasible way of reducing the cost of an optical-packet-switching
   (OPS) or optical-burst-switching (OBS) node. Theoretical analyses of the
   performance of different TWC sharing schemes in Published works are
   mostly confined to synchronous switching nodes, and for asynchronous
   switching nodes, only simulation results are given. In this paper, a
   theoretical analysis of the performance of the TWC share-per-link (SPL)
   scheme for an asynchronous switching node is given with the assumptions
   of Poisson burst arrival and exponential burst-length distribution.
   Based on this analysis, the performance of a share-per-node (SPN) scheme
   can be evaluated by means of two approximate-evaluation models (AEMs).
   Quick evaluation methods for SPL and SPN schemes are also proposed.
   Simulation results show that the theoretical analysis is accurate and
   the approximate ones can get quite similar results. All results indicate
   that both SPL and SPN schemes will save TWCs in an OBS node, whereas SPN
   will save more than SPL to obtain the same burstloss performance.}},

Abstract = {{Glacier naled formation is associated with surge-type glaciers both
   during active surging and in quiescence. During the 1995-98 surge of
   Kuannersuit Glacier, Disko Island, West Greenland, turbid winter runoff
   produced an extensive naled accretion with a distinct debris-rich
   stratification. After surge termination the summer occurrence of naledi
   gradually decreased and disappeared within 5 years. The fine-grained
   debris was deposited on top of outwash deposits on bars and banks.
   Observations at the margin of surrounding glaciers revealed that only
   surge-type glaciers in their quiescent phase had proglacial naled
   assemblages, although these lacked incorporated debris. This indicates
   that surge-type glaciers have a significant impact on the occurrence of
   naledi primarily because their subglacial thermal conditions and water
   storage capacity allow significant winter runoff implying high hydraulic
   pressure on proglacial outwash plains. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Two oxetane-derived monomers 3-(2-cyanoethoxy)methyl- and
   3-(methoxy(triethylenoxy)) methyl-3'-methyloxetane were prepared from
   the reaction of 3-methyl-3'-hydroxymethyloxetane with acrylonitrile and
   triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, respectively. Their homo- and
   copolyethers were synthesized with BF3 center dot Et2O/1,4-butanediol
   and trifluoromethane sulfonic acid as initiator through cationic
   ring-opening polymerization. The structure of the polymers was
   characterized by FTIR and(1)H NMR. The ratio of two repeating units
   incorporated into the copolymers is well consistent with the feed ratio.
   Regarding glass transition temperature (T-g), the DSC data imply that
   the resulting copolymers have a lower Tg than pure poly(ethylene oxide).
   Moreover, the TGA measurements reveal that they possess in general a
   high heat decomposition temperature. The ion conductivity of a sample
   (P-AN 20) is 1.07 x 10-(5) S cm(-1) at room temperature and 2.79 x
   10(-4) S cm(-1) at 80 degrees C, thus presenting the potential to meet

Title = {{Time and risk analysis for acute type A aortic dissection surgery
   performed by hypothermic circulatory arrest, cerebral perfusion, and
   open distal aortic anastomosis}},
Journal = {{HEART SURGERY FORUM}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hypothermic total circulatory arrest, retrograde or
   antegrade cerebral perfusion, and open distal anastomosis are important
   stages of surgical management and cerebral protection for acute type A
   dissections. Among the factors that influence survival are the transfer
   time to hospital from the onset of symptoms, in-hospital transfer time
   to operation, organ malperfusion, preoperative risk factors, and
   intraoperative variables. The aim of this study was to analyze time and
   risk factors during surgical management.
   Methods: Between September 1996 and March 2002, a total of 26 patients
   with acute type A aortic dissection were operated. Sixteen patients
   (61.5\%) were male and mean age was 49 (13.1 years ( range: 26-68). The
   diagnosis was based on clinical examination, telecardiography,
   transthoracic echocardiography, computerized tomography, and
   angiography. Hypothermic total circulatory arrest, retrograde or
   antegrade cerebral perfusion and open distal anastomosis were used
   during the procedures. Operative techniques were as follows:
   supracoronary ascending aortic replacement ( 17 patients), aortic root
   and ascending aortic replacement with flanged composite grafting
   technique ( 5 patients), replacement of ascending aorta and hemiarcus (
   1 patient), aortic root and ascending aortic replacement with modified
   Bentall technique ( 1 patient), replacement of ascending aorta and arcus
   ( 1 patient), and total arcus replacement with elephant trunk technique
   and modified Bentall procedure ( 1 patient).
   Results: The early postoperative mortality rate within the first 30 days
   was 26.9\%, and the late postoperative mortality rate was 15.8\%. Two
   patients (7.7\%) developed major neurological complications during the
   postoperative period. Time to admission, durations of total circulatory
   arrest, cross-clamp, cardiopulmonary bypass, and intubation were longer,
   and postoperative blood loss was greater in patients who died during
   early postoperative period, although the differences did not reach
   statistical significance. Duration of total circulatory arrest was
   longer in patients who developed neurological dysfunction compared to
   patients without this complication; this difference also did not reach
   statistical significance.
   Conclusions: Total circulatory arrest, cerebral perfusion, and open
   distal anastomosis are reliable options in the surgical management of
   acute type A aortic dissections. With open distal anastomosis aortic
   arcus can be evaluated, distal anastomosis can be performed more easily,
   and postoperative neurological recovery is hastened. In the present
   study, although statistical significance could not be reached due to
   limited sample size, the time to admission, durations of total
   circulatory arrest, cross-clamp, and cardiopulmonary bypass, and the
   amount of postoperative chest output seem to influence postoperative
   survival.}},

Abstract = {{Free-space optical cross connect (OXC) for optical switching has shown
   promise in replacing traditional electronic switching fabrics.
   Micromachined optical switches offer superior performance in terms of
   bit rate and protocol transparency, which make them futureproof;
   however, they suffer from nonuniformity in port-to-port optical losses,
   which limit their use in large-scale optical connects. Recent reports on
   a novel two-dimensional (2-D) OXC architecture, L-switching matrix,
   presented that it can significantly improve nonuniformity in optical
   losses among all output ports. The drawback of L-switching matrix is
   that it is rearrangeably nonblocking (RNB) and not strictly nonblocking.
   This paper presents solutions to optimize its switching algorithms. A
   staircase-switching algorithm is proposed to minimize the occurrence of
   internal blocking conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical application of 5-aminolaevulinic
   acid (ALA) is a promising new treatment option for the management of
   various cutaneous malignancies. Generally, topical ALA-based PDT has
   relatively insignificant adverse effect,; of transient character; these
   include itching, stinging or burning pain and slight to moderate
   erythema. We describe the first case of photocontact urticaria induced
   by topical ALA-based PDT for the treatment of unilesional mycosis
   fungoides. Although the first treatment session resulted merely in mild
   erythema, the second PDT caused marked urticaria corresponding to the
   PDT-applied area with an intolerable stinging sensation. A photopatch
   test demonstrated that black light and visible light irradiation after
   topical ALA Provoked an urticarial reaction in the patient's uninvolved
   skin. These observations suggested an allergic pathogenesis for the
   wheal formation induced by PDT with topical ALA in this case.
   Photocontact urticaria should be considered as a possible adverse effect

Abstract = {{We report the results of a primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) in 7
   patients with advanced active tuberculous arthritis of the hip and had
   lost the chance of preserving the hip without replacement surgery.
   Tuberculosis was confirmed in all cases by the culture or histological
   examination. All patients were treated with primary THA followed by
   antituberculous medications for I year. Cementless stems and sockets
   were used in all patients. The average follow-up period was 4.8 years.
   The reactivation of the infection was not detected in all cases. The
   result was excellent in all patients according to the Harris Hip Score.
   Total hip arthroplasty in the tuberculous hip is a safe procedure and
   produces superior functional results compared with resection
   arthroplasty or arthrodesis. The results of primary THA in the selected
   patients was satisfactory as they rapidly recover from the disease.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of Escherichia
   coli O157:H7 inoculum level (4 {[}L] and 7 {[}H] log cfu/cm(2)) on its
   inactivation during drying and storage of beef jerky slices (8.7 x 4.0 x
   0.6 cm). Beef jerky slices at each inoculum level were untreated (C),
   exposed to a traditional marinade (M), or exposed to a 5\% acetic acid
   solution followed by traditional marination (AM). Surviving bacterial
   populations were determined during 10h of drying (60 degrees C) and
   60days of aerobic storage (25 degrees C) using tryptic soy agar
   supplemented with 0.1\% pyruvate (TSAP), sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) agar,
   and modified eosin methylene blue (MEMB) agar, Irrespective of recovery
   Culture media and inoculation level, the AM treatment decreased (P <
   0.05) bacterial populations more (P < 0.05) than the C or M treatments
   during the 10 h of drying. The death rate (log cfu/h) in AM-treated
   samples was higher during the first 4 h of drying (first death phase)
   for H (0.9) than L (0.5-0.6); however, death rates in samples of C and M
   treatments were 0.7 and 0.6-0.7 at H and 0.7-0.8 and 0.7-0.8 at L,
   respectively. The results suggest that the acetic acid treatment may
   have sensitized the cells at the high inoculum level causing
   inactivation by drying, thus enhancing destruction of higher inoculation
   levels. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This is the first light scattering study demonstrating that the size of
   micelles, the aggregation number, and the mobility of the core blocks of
   the micelles could be controlled by the length of the cross-linker in
   the micellar cores. The core cross-linked micelles were prepared using a
   poly{[}(4-pyridinemethoxy-methyl)styrene]-block-polystyrene
   (PPySt-b-PSt) diblock copolymer and perfluoroalkyl dicarboxylic acid.
   The PPySt-b-PSt copolymer formed the micelles in THF, a nonselective
   solvent, in the presence of the perfluoroalkyl dicarboxylic acid. The
   light scattering studies demonstrated that the micellar size and
   aggregation number were dependent on the chain length of the
   perfluoroalkyl dicarboxylic acid. Perfluoroazelaic acid produced
   micelles with a larger hydrodynamic radius and higher aggregation number
   than tetrafluorosuccinic acid. The micellization proceeded through the
   formation of the pyridinium carboxylate and the cross-linkage between
   the PPySt blocks via the dicarboxylic acid. The core cross-linked
   micelles were thermally stable and maintained its structure with changes
   in the temperature. A H-1 NMR analysis revealed that the micelles

Abstract = {{Heme-regulated phosphodiesterase from Escherichia coli (DOSEc) catalyzes
   the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in vitro and is regulated by the
   redox state of the bound heme. Changes in the redox state result in
   alterations in the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, which is
   then transmitted to the functional domain to switch catalysis on or off.
   Because DOSE, was originally cloned from E. coli genomic DNA, it has not
   been known whether it is actually expressed in wild-type E. coli. In
   addition, the turnover number of DOSE. using cAMP as a substrate is only
   0.15 min(-1), which is relatively low for a physiologically relevant
   enzyme. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that
   the DOSEc gene and protein are expressed in wild-type E. coli,
   especially under aerobic conditions. We also developed a DOSEc gene
   knockout strain (Delta dos). Interestingly, the knockout of dos caused
   excess accumulation of intracellular cAMP (26-fold higher than in the
   wild-type strain) under aerobic conditions, whereas accumulation of cAMP
   was not observed under anaerobic conditions. We also found differences
   in cell morphology and growth rate between the mutant cells and the
   wild-type strain. The changes in the knockout strain were partially
   complemented by introducing an expression plasmid for dos. Thus, the
   present study revealed that expression of DOSEc is regulated according
   to environmental O-2 availability at the transcriptional level and that
   the concentration of cAMP in cells is regulated by DOSEc expression.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic reversal behaviors of An (60 nm)-FePt (x nm) thin films with
   various x values are investigated. A high temperature heat treatment at
   800 degrees C was applied to obtain an isolated microstructure with
   L1(o) FePt particles embedded in a face-centered cubic gold matrix
   through interfacial diffusion. The coercivity of the thin films was
   increased from 13.6 kOe to a maximum value of 30.0 kOe as the thickness
   of the FePt layer was decreased from 200 to 10 mn. From the dc
   demagnetization and isothermal remanence magnetization measurements, we
   found that the bilayer sample with x = 10 exhibits larger reversible
   magnetization. The coercive mechanism was found to be controlled by the
   magnetization rotation of the isolated FePt particles. As x is
   increased, the reversal behavior is changed into a domain-wall motion
   mode gradually. The magnetic force microscopy investigations further
   confirm the change of mechanism. The domain-wall motion appears to
   result from the formation of large multidomain grains. Considering the
   relation of reversal behavior and the coercivity, we thus conclude that
   the removal of domain walls is beneficial for hard magnetic performance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To study the correlation of toxicity with biodegradability
   (BODT) in order to promote QSBR development and understand the
   degradation mechanism. Methods: Toxicity of substituted phenols to river
   bacteria was determined by the turbidities that were measured using a
   spectrophotometer (UV-190) at 530 nm against a blank control. The
   biodegradability of substituted phenols was expressed as BODT and the DO
   concentrations were determined by the iodometric titration method.
   Results: The BODT and toxicity(log 1/IC50) of 12 substituted phenols to
   bacteria from the Songhua River were determined respectively. The
   correlation of biodegradability with toxicity was developed: BODT = 8.21
   (+/- 2.22) pKa -32.44 (+/- 8.28) log 1/IC50 +89.04 (+/- 38.20), n = 12,
   R-2 = 0.791, R-2(adj) = 0.745, SE = 9.134, F = 17.066, P = 0.001.
   Conclusion: The BODT of substituted phenols was influenced by their
   toxicity and the ionization constant pKa. The stronger the toxicity, the
   less readily the compound was degraded by river bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Drought resistance of rice is a complex trait and is mainly determined
   by mechanisms of drought avoidance and drought tolerance. The present
   study was conducted to characterize the genetic basis of drought
   resistance at reproductive stage in field by analyzing the QTLs for
   drought response index (DRI, normalized by potential yield and flowering
   time), relative yield, relative spikelet fertility, and four traits of
   plant water status and their relationships with root traits using a
   recombinant inbred population derived from a cross between an indica
   rice and upland rice. A total of 39 QTLs for these traits were detected
   with individual QTL explained 5.1-32.1\% of phenotypic variation. Only
   two QTLs for plant water status were commonly detected in two
   environments, suggesting different mechanisms might exist in two types
   of soil conditions. DRI has no correlation with potential yield and
   flowering time under control, suggesting that it can be used as a good
   drought resistance index in field conditions. The co-location of QTLs
   for canopy temperature and delaying in flowering time suggested a
   usefulness of these two traits as indexes in drought resistance
   screening. Correlation and QTL congruence between root traits and
   putative drought tolerance traits revealed that drought avoidance (via
   thick and deep root traits) was the main genetic basis of drought
   resistance in sandy soil condition, while drought tolerance may play
   more role in the genetic basis of drought resistance in paddy soil
   condition. Therefore, both drought mechanisms and soil textures must be
   considered in the improvement of drought resistance at reproductive
   stage in rice.}},

Abstract = {{The spermatogenesis of the free-living marine nematode Metachromadora
   itoi was studied with electron microscopy. Spermatocytes and early
   spermatids have no cytoplasmic components specific for nematodes, i.e.
   membranous organelles (MO) and fibrous bodies (FB). The late spermatids
   are subdivided into the residual body and the main cell body with a
   centrally located nucleus devoid of a nuclear envelope. A pair of 9 x 2
   centrioles is associated with the nuclei of spermatids and spermatozoa.
   The nucleus of the mature spermatid is surrounded by a thick mass of
   radially arranged FB delimited externally by a discontinuous layer of
   mitochondria, which underlie a thin ectoplasm. Sperm development is
   accompanied by transfer of FB matter through the mitochondrion layer
   into the ectoplasm. The immature spermatozoa from the testis have the
   centrally located nucleus surrounded by a transparent halo with remnants
   of FB. The halo is delimited by a sphere of mitochondria that underlie
   the thick fibrous ectoplasm, a derivative of the FB. In the mature
   spermatozoa the ectoplasm is transformed into the prominent unpolarized
   pseudopod. The central nucleus is surrounded by a transparent halo and a
   sphere of mitochondria, which underlie the pseudopod. MO were not found
   throughout spermatogenesis. In general, spermatogenesis in M. itoi
   differs from that observed in many nematodes but resembles in some
   details the sperm development in some chromadorid and tylenchomorph
   nematodes. The phylogenetic importance of this sperm development is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives. We study morphologic characteristics and
   age-related changes in patients with schizophrenia to investigate
   whether abnormal neurodevelopment and brain structure have a role in the
   pathophysiological course of this disease.
   Materials and Methods. Our data consist of a set of cranial magnetic
   resonance images of 46 patients with schizophrenia and age- and
   sex-matched healthy controls. We deformed a template brain image to our
   set of subject images. Jacobian fields of these deformations were
   reduced to sets of 52 normalized region volumes for each subject by
   using a neuroanatornic atlas. Normalized regional volumes of the control
   and patient groups were compared by using Student t-test, and age
   correlation of each region volume was calculated for the two groups. All
   results were corrected for multiple comparisons by using permutation
   testing. We used a classifier based on support vector machines and a
   feature selection method to determine our ability to discriminate brains
   of controls from those of patients.
   Results. Analysis of normalized region volumes shows enlargement of the
   third ventricle in patients. The age-correlation study showed a
   significant positive correlation in the third ventricle and right
   thalamus of controls, but not patients. Using an average of 6.5
   features, our classifier was able to correctly identify 72\% of patients
   and 70\% of controls.
   Conclusion. In addition to enlargement of the third ventricle, brains of
   patients with schizophrenia show a different pattern of age-related
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{The acid catalyzed sol-gel reaction was used to encapsulate methyl
   orange pH-indicator into transparent monolithic silica matrices.
   Tetraethylorthosilicate was used for the entrapment of the methyl orange
   indicator. The immobilized methyl orange shows similar behavior as its
   solution counterpart. It retains its structure during the sol-gel
   reactions in terms of response to pH. The surface morphology indicates
   that the methyl orange molecules are weakly interacted within the host
   silica network. This study shows that the methyl orange pH-indicator can
   be doped into sol-gel silica matrix and used for sensing pH as a solid
   indicator. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For the most stable linear isomer of C3S in its X-1 Sigma(+) state a
   six- dimensional potential energy surface ( PES) has been calculated ab
   initio by coupled cluster - connected triples ( CCSD( T)) method. The
   analytic form of the PES has been transformed in a quartic force field
   in dimensionless normal coordinates and employed in calculations of
   spectroscopic constants using second- order perturbation theory. The PES
   and the full kinetic energy operator in internal coordinates have been
   used to calculate variationally the anharmonic ro- vibrational energies
   for J = 0 and J = 1. The two experimental band origins of C3S observed
   in the gas phase, v(1) and v(1)+v(5)-v(5), agree very well with the
   theoretical values. The anharmonic ro- vibrational levels, including the
   bending modes up to 2200 cm(-1), are reported. The singlet ground state
   PES has a saddle point at about 1.25 eV above the linear minimum and two
   other higher lying cyclic local minima. The only dipole- and spin-
   allowed electronic transition between 0 and 5 eV is calculated to be the
   (1)Pi- X-1 Sigma(+) transition with a vertical transition energy of
   353.2 nm in good agreement with the matrix value of 378 nm. The
   dissociative paths C + C2S, C-2 + CS and C-3 + S of low lying singlet
   and triplet states have been investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Background- Mitral valve repair is considered better than mitral valve
   replacement for degenerative mitral regurgitation. Aim To evaluate late
   clinical results of;mitral valve repair as compared to mitral valve
   replacement in patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation. Patients
   and methods: All patients subjected to open heart surgery for
   degenerative mitral regurgitation between 1990 and 2002 were assessed
   for surgical mortality late cardiac and overall mortality, reoperation,
   readmission to hospital, functional capacity and anticoagulant therapy.
   Eighty eight patients (48 males) bad mitral valve repair and 28 (79
   males) bad mitral valve replacement (23 with a mechanical prosthesis).
   Mean age was 59.9 +/- 14.8 (SD) and 61.3 +/- 14.6 years, respectively.
   Sixty three percent of patients with repair and 50\% of those with,
   valve replacement were in functional class III or IV before surgery.
   Results: Operative mortality was 2.3\% for mitral valve repair and 3.6\%
   for mitral valve replacement (NS). Also, there was no statistical
   difference in the need of reoperation during the follow-up period
   between both procedures (2.3\% and 0\%, respectively). Ninety four
   percent of the replacement patients but only 269,6 of the repair
   patients were in anticoagulant tberapy at the end of the follow-up
   period (p < 0.001). Ten years survival rates were 82 +/- 6\% for mitral
   valve repair and 54 +/- 1.1\% for replacement. The corresponding cardiac
   related survival rates were 89 +/- 6\% and 79 +/- 10\%. At the end of
   follow-up, all surviving patients were in functional class I or II. Ten
   years freedom from cardiac event rates (death, cardiac related
   rehospitalization and reoperation) were 90 +/- 3\% for mitral valve
   repair and 84 +/- 6\% for replacement. Conclusion: Repair of the mitral
   valve offers a better overall survival and a better chance of freedom
   from cardiac events as well as need for anticoagulation 10 years after
   surgery (Rev Med Chile 2005; 133: 1139-46).}},

Abstract = {{Background: The use of the MammoSite brachytherapy balloon catheter is I
   option for the delivery of accelerated partial breast irradiation during
   breast cancer therapy. The device can be inserted into the breast using
   3 different techniques. This report describes these methods of insertion
   and correlates the technique with outcome data collected in a
   multi-institutional registry trial.
   Methods: In the registry trial, MammoSite catheters were inserted either
   (1) at the time of lumpectomy into an open cavity, (2) after surgery
   with ultrasound guidance through a separate small lateral incision into
   a closed cavity, or (3) after surgery by entering directly through the
   lumpectomy wound (the scar entry technique). Device placement techniques
   in 1403 patients with early stage breast cancer treated at 87
   institutions by 223 different investigators were documented in the
   registry. Data collected included number of cases of each technique, age
   of patient, tumor size, skin spacing, catheter pull rates and reasons,
   infection, radiation recall, cosmesis, and recurrence.
   Results: Catheter placement at the time of lumpectomy was performed in
   619 patients (44\%), after surgery with ultrasound guidance in 576
   patients (41\%), and the scar entry technique technique in 197 patients
   (14\%). The type of technique was not associated with age of patient,
   tumor size, bra size, catheter size, skin spacing, infection, radiation
   recall, cosmesis, or recurrence. There was a statistically significant
   increased incidence of premature catheter removals for pathologically
   related reasons with the open-cavity technique compared with the 2
   postoperative methods secondary to final histology reports disqualifying
   the patient after MammoSite placement.
   Conclusions: These registry data show that the MammoSite catheter can be
   inserted with any 1 of 3 different techniques. A postoperative
   placement, after the final pathology report is issued, decreases the
   incidence of premature removal of the catheter because of disqualifying
   pathology. (c) 2005 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NATURE PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{1}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Crackling noise is a common feature in many dynamic systems(1-9), the
   most familiar instance of which is the sound made by a sheet of paper
   when crumpled into a ball. Although seemingly random, this noise
   contains fundamental information about the properties of the system in
   which it occurs. One potential source of such information lies in the
   asymmetric shape of noise pulses emitted by a diverse range of noisy
   systems(8-12), but the cause of this asymmetry has lacked
   explanation(1). Here we show that the leftward asymmetry observed in the
   Barkhausen effect(2)-the noise generated by the jerky motion of domain
   walls as they interact with impurities in a soft magnet-is a direct
   consequence of a magnetic domain wall's negative effective mass. As well
   as providing a means of determining domain-wall effective mass from a
   magnet's Barkhausen noise, our work suggests an inertial explanation for
   the origin of avalanche asymmetries in crackling-noise phenomena more
   generally.}},

Abstract = {{A two-phase flow in a rectangular bubble column of 100 x 20 mm
   cross-section and 1.5 mm height was studied using a high-speed video
   system. Series of images were taken at different elevations at a
   frequency of 500 Hz. The images were processed using a bubble
   recognition algorithm. In such a way, an individual bubble in the gas
   swarm could be tracked. The time-averaged velocity profiles and the
   turbulent diffusion coefficients were derived as a function of the
   superficial gas velocity.
   The lateral displacement of bubbles travelling over a certain vertical
   distance was transformed into a probability density distribution in
   order to measure the turbulent diffusion coefficient of the gaseous
   phase. The shape of the distributions obtained was found to fit well to
   the Gaussian standard distribution. The dispersion coefficients were
   observed to grow proportionally to the square root of the vertical
   distance. The diffusion coefficients were calculated from the
   proportionality factor and were compared with some correlations
   published in the literature. The experiments were performed for
   superficial gas velocities ranging from 1 to 6 mm/s. The bubbles were
   generated either by a porous sparger or a set of capillaries placed at
   the bottom of the column. The measurements were taken at different
   heights between 1 and 1.2 m where the bubble cloud was occupying the
   entire cross-section. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although resourcefulness may facilitate coping with caregiver stress and

   resourcefulness, this study examined situational (socioeconomic status,

   number of health problems, systolic blood pressure), and psychological
   factors (positive cognitions) as predictors of resourcefulness. Methods:
   A random sample of 97 African American caregivers and 110 noncaregivers
   provided data via structured interviews and 24-hour ambulatory blood
   pressure monitoring. Results: No physiological indicators predicted
   resourcefulness; however, daily hassles, social support, and positive
   cognitions were significant predictors. Age, number of health problems,
   daily hassles, and social support had indirect effects on
   resourcefulness through positive cognitions. Discussion: These findings
   suggest a need to further examine the impact of daily hassles, social
   support, and positive cognitions on caregiving and continued review of

Abstract = {{Objectives: Pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) models have become
   increasingly important in optimizing antimicrobial therapy. This
   approach is highly recommended by regulatory authorities intending to
   force the evaluation of antimicrobial action at the site of infection.
   Methods: Clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus
   aureus with MICs of 4, 8 and 16 mg/L for piperacillin were used in an in
   vivo PK/in vitro PD model. Bacteria were exposed in vitro to the
   concentration-versus-time profiles of piperacillin in plasma and
   subcutaneous adipose tissue measured in vivo in septic patients. Samples
   were withdrawn at defined intervals and the numbers of bacteria per mL
   were counted and plotted against time.
   Results: Piperacillin levels determined in plasma were able to
   effectively inhibit bacterial growth of all bacterial strains used in
   the present study (MIC ranged from 4-16 mg/L). In contrast,
   concentration-versus-time profiles of subcutaneous adipose tissue were
   effective in killing isolates with MICs of 4 and 8 mg/L only, while
   bacterial growth of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa with MICs of 16 mg/L was
   not inhibited.
   Conclusions: Bacteria with MICs < 16 mg/L were effectively inhibited in
   subcutaneous adipose tissue in patients with sepsis. The prediction of
   microbiological outcome based on concentrations of piperacillin in
   plasma resulted in a marked overestimation of antimicrobial activity at
   the site of infection.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{182}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4) is critical for hydrolysis of
   cAMP formed by stimulation of beta adrenergic receptors. However, it is
   not known if PDE4 is associated with beta adrenergic receptors in the
   mediation of antidepressant-like effects. Objective: The aim of the
   study is to determine the relationship between PDE4 and beta adrenergic
   receptor-mediated cAMP signaling in mediating antidepressant-like
   effects. Methods: The effects of the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram, alone or
   combined with dobutamine or clenbuterol, selective beta-1 and beta-2
   adrenergic agonists, respectively, on behavior were examined in rats
   under a differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL) schedule and rats
   trained to discriminate rolipram from vehicle. Their effects on cAMP in
   primary cultures of rat cerebral cortical neurons also were determined.
   Results: Rolipram (0.01 - 0.3 mg/kg), dobutamine (1 - 30 mg/kg), and
   clenbuterol (0.03 - 0.3 mg/kg) dose-dependently produced
   antidepressant-like effects on DRL behavior, decreasing response rate
   and increasing reinforcement rate. The effects of beta adrenergic
   agonists were potentiated by rolipram. Isobolographic analysis revealed
   that rolipram enhanced the antidepressant-like effect of dobutamine
   additively and that of clenbuterol synergistically. Consistently, a
   combination of ineffective doses of rolipram (0.03 mg/kg) and dobutamine
   (3 mg/kg) or clenbuterol (0.03 mg/kg) completely` substituted for the
   rolipram discrimination stimulus. Further, incubation with an
   ineffective concentration of clenbuterol, but not dobutamine, in the
   presence of a subeffective concentration of rolipram, significantly
   increased cAMP in cultured cortical neurons. Conclusions: PDE4 plays an
   important role in regulating cAMP signaling by either beta-1 or beta-2
   adrenergic receptors that mediate antidepressant-like actions; beta-2
   adrenergic receptor-mediated cAMP signaling appears more responsive than
   beta-1 cAMP signaling to PDE4 inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical method, a transmission matrix method,
   for the wave propagation in viscoelastic stratified saturated porous
   media. The wave propagation in saturated media, based on Biot theory, is
   a coupled problem. In this stratified three-dimensional model we do the
   Laplace transform for the time variable and the Fourier transform for
   the horizontal space coordinate. The original problem is transformed
   into ordinary differential equations with six independent unknown
   variables, which are only the function of the coordinate of depth. Thus,
   we get a transmission matrix of the wave problem for each layer. In the
   process of solution we use numerical method to calculate the eigenvalues
   and the eigenvectors of the transmission matrices. In the first step of
   the solution process we can obtain the wave field in the transformed
   space. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) method is used to do the inverse
   Laplace and the inverse Fourier transforms to get the solution in the
   time space. The detailed formulae are derived and some numerical
   examples are given.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there have been several new results for an old topic, the
   Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Specifically, it has been shown that for
   a wide class of parameter estimation problems (e.g. for objects with
   deterministic dynamics) the matrix CRLB, with both measurement origin
   uncertainty (i.e., in the presence of false alarms or random clutter)
   and measurement noise, is simply that without measurement origin
   uncertainty times a scalar information reduction factor (IRF).
   Conversely, there has arisen a neat expression for the CRLB for state
   estimation of a stochastic dynamic nonlinear system (i.e., objects with
   a stochastic motion); but this is only valid without measurement origin
   uncertainty. The present paper can be considered a marriage of the two
   topics: the clever Riccati-like form from the latter is preserved, but
   it includes the IRF from the former. The effects of plant and
   observation dynamics on the CRLB are explored. Further, the CRLB is
   compared via simulation to two common target tracking algorithms, the
   probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) and the multi-frame (N-D)
   assignment algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we reported on a tomato ERF transcription activator, TERF1,
   which was concluded to act as a linker between ethylene and osmotic
   signal pathways. We now report on the regulatory role of TERF1 in ABA
   sensitivity and drought response during seedling development. Northern
   blotting analysis indicated that the transcripts of TERF1 were
   significantly accumulated in response to drought, cold and ABA. TERF1
   activated GCC box- or DRE-driven reporter gene expression in transient
   expression assay, subsequently increasing the tolerance to drought and
   the osmoticum, PEG6000, in tobacco expressing TERF1. Further tests
   showed that TERF1 did not affect the seed germination, but greatly
   enhanced the sensitivity during tobacco seedling development under ABA
   treatment. This ABA hypersensitivity in transgenic TERF1 tobacco is both
   indirect ethylene action and expressions of ABA responsive genes,
   demonstrating that TERF1 is a multifunctional ERF protein that can
   integrate different stress signal pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear dynamic methods and perturbation methods are compared in terms
   of the effects of signal length, sampling rate, and noise. Results of
   theoretical and experimental studies quantitatively show that
   measurements representing frequency and amplitude perturbations are not
   applicable to chaotic signals because of difficulties in pitch tracking
   and sensitivity to initial state differences. Perturbation analyses are
   only reliable when applied to nearly periodic voice samples of
   sufficiently long signal lengths that were obtained at high sampling
   rates and low noise levels. In contrast, nonlinear dynamic methods, such
   as correlation dimension, allow the quantification of chaotic time
   series. Additionally, the correlation dimension method presents a more
   stable analysis of nearly periodic voice samples for shorter signal
   lengths, lower sampling rates, and higher noise levels. The correlation
   dimension method avoids some of the methodological issues associated
   with perturbation methods, and may potentially improve the ability for
   real time analysis as well as reduce costs in experimental designs for
   objectively assessing voice disorders. (c) 2005 Acoustical Sociey of

Abstract = {{A refined non-conforming triangular plate/shell element for linear and
   geometrically nonlinear analysis of plates and shells is developed in
   this paper based on the refined non-conforming element method (RNEM). A
   conforming triangle membrane element with drilling degrees of freedom in
   Cartesian coordinates and the refined non-conforming triangular
   plate-bending element RT9, in which Kirchhoff kinematic assumption was
   adopted, are used to construct the present element. The displacement
   continuity condition along the interelement boundary is satisfied in an
   average sense for plate analysis, and the coupled displacement
   continuity requirement at the interelement is satisfied in an average
   sense, thereby improving the performance of the element for shell
   analysis. Selectively reduced integration with stabilization scheme is
   employed in this paper to avoid membrane locking. Numerical examples
   demonstrate that the present element behaves quite satisfactorily either
   for the linear analysis of plate bending problems and plane problems or
   for the geometrically nonlinear analysis of thin plates and shells with
   large displacement, moderate rotation but small strain.}},

Abstract = {{Shear band localization is investigated by a strain-gradient-enhanced
   damage model for quasi-brittle geomaterials. This model introduces the
   strain gradients and their higher-order conjugate stresses into the
   framework of continuum damage mechanics. The influence of the strain
   gradients on the constitutive behaviour is taken into account through a
   generalized damage evolutionary law. A weak-form variational principle
   is employed to address the additional boundary conditions introduced by
   the incorporation of the strain gradients and the conjugate higher-order
   stresses. Damage localization under simple shear condition is
   analytically investigated by using the theory of discontinuous
   bifurcation and the concept of the second-order characteristic surface.
   Analytical solutions for the distributions of strain rates and strain
   gradient rates, as well as the band width of localised damage are found.
   Numerical analysis demonstrates the shear band width is proportionally
   related to the internal length scale through a coefficient function of
   Poisson's ratio and a parameter representing the shape of uniaxial
   stress-strain curve. It is also shown that the obtained distributions of
   strains and strain gradients are well in accordance with the underlying
   assumptions for the second-order discontinuous shear band boundary and
   the weak discontinuous bifurcation theory. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background. High-resolution DNA melting analysis with saturation dyes
   for either mutation scanning of PCR products or genotyping with
   unlabeled probes has been reported. However, simultaneous PCR product
   scanning and probe genotyping in the same reaction has not been
   described.
   Methods: Asymmetric PCR was performed in the presence of unlabeled
   oligonucleotide probes and a saturating fluorescent DNA dye.
   High-resolution melting curves for samples in either capillaries (0.3
   degrees C/s) or microtiter format (0.1 degrees C/s) were generated in
   the same containers used for amplification. Melting curves of the factor
   V Leiden single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and several mutations in
   exons 10 and 11 of the cystic fibrosis transconductance regulator gene
   were analyzed for both PCR product and probe melting transitions.
   Results: Independent verification of genotype for simple SNPs was
   achieved by either PCR product or probe melting transitions. Two
   unlabeled probes in one reaction could genotype many sequence variants
   with simultaneous scanning of the entire PCR product. For example,
   analysis of both product and probe melting transitions genotyped Delta
   F508, Delta I507, Q493X, I506V, and F508C variants in exon 10 and G551D,
   G542X, and R553X variants in exon 11. Unbiased hierarchal clustering of
   the melting transitions identified the specific sequence variants.
   Conclusions: When DNA melting is performed rapidly and observed at high
   resolution with saturating DNA dyes, it is possible to scan for
   mutations and genotype at the same time within a few minutes after
   amplification. The method is no more complex than PCR and may reduce the
   need for resequencing. (c) 2005 American Association for Clinical

Abstract = {{Most cross-cultural research on Chinese and American children's early

   and number operations. The present study broadened the range of tasks
   assessed to include geometric shapes, problem solving and logical

   determine if. (a) there are within- and cross-culture differences in the
   development of mathematical knowledge in all domains and (b) the
   rate/order of development of the four different mathematics skills are
   comparable across cultures? One-hundred-and-sixty Chinese and US first
   grade students participated in this study one month after they entered
   first grade. The results indicated that Chinese and US children's
   mathematical knowledge in the domain of numbers and operations is better
   developed than their mathematical knowledge in the other three domains,
   Chinese children outperformed American children on almost all tasks in
   all of the domains and the level of difficulty of mathematics concepts,
   across culture, seems to be universal (e.g. children's conceptual
   knowledge within each of these domains seems to develop in the same
   order across cultures). The theoretical and educational implications of

Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{1585-1609}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the role of intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) in
   the onset of the South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM). Two major
   components of ISO (10-20-day and 30-60-day modes) are identified. The
   coupling of these two intraseasonal modes during the pre-monsoon period
   of the SCSSM are investigated by examining the filtered outgoing
   longwave radiation (OLR), low-level circulation, apparent heat source
   and apparent moisture sink from October of a previous calendar year to
   September of a calendar year.
   The zonal and meridional propagations of the 10-20-day and 30-60-day
   modes are found to be different, which reflects their different roles in
   the establishment and development of the SCSSM. The northwestward
   propagation of the 10-20-day mode is associated with the weakening of
   the subtropical high over the western Pacific, while the northeastward
   propagation of the 30-60-day mode originates from convection over the
   equatorial Indian Ocean. A hypothesis is then proposed to explain the
   observed variabilities in the SCSSM onset. When the equatorial Indian
   Ocean exhibits a 30-60-day mode oscillation, an initially weak
   convection develops into a large convection band (or monsoon trough).
   Meanwhile, a convective disturbance of the 10-20-day mode is induced
   when this monsoon trough extends to the western Pacific. These two
   processes then collaborate to cause a weakening of the subtropical
   anticyclone over the South China Sea. Because the monsoon trough
   associated with the 30-60-day mode subsequently propagates northward
   into the Bay of Bengal (BOB), the induced vortex together with the
   10-20-day westward-migrating convection from the equatorial western
   Pacific will substantially increase the effect of horizontal advection
   of moisture and heat, thus destabilizing the atmosphere and weakening
   the subtropical ridge there. Westerlies can then penetrate and prevail
   over the SCS region, and the SCSSM onset occurs. Copyright (c) 2005

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel slotted Dual-Channel Reservation (DCR)
   MAC protocol that uses 802.11 primitives for providing both Quality of
   Service (QoS) and fairness. RTS/CTS handshaking is transmitted on a
   separated control channel to prevent successive collisions of RTS and
   CTS packets with existing data transmission. Furthermore, contention for
   channel access may be initiated by sender as well as receiver depending
   on the channel status for better fairness. A simple slot reservation
   algorithm in the data channel provides high efficiency. The main
   conclusion is that reservation access benefits both delay performance,
   and efficiency as well as fairness - the reason being that not only an
   exposed terminal can regain the channel more easily because of
   dramatically reduced contention (RTS-CTS) traffic, but also a hidden
   terminal receives less collisions in handshaking since any node winning
   a slot will quit contending on the control channel. Therefore, it is
   highly recommended to use reservation access even if the prevailing
   traffic is data, e. g. TCP. To enhance delay performance, we devise a
   fake packet repeating mechanism that can reserve the slot for a
   connection even if the user temporarily has no packets to transmit.
   Simulations based on key metrics - throughput, fairness index and mean
   delay are performed to validate the new protocol and quantify its
   advantages. The limitations of the proposed DCR-802.11 protocol due to
   need for global clock synchronization and dual channels are also
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Benign versus malignant breast masses: Optical differentiation with
   US-guided optical imaging reconstruction}},
Journal = {{RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{237}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{57-66}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To investigate prospectively the feasibility of using optical
   tomography with ultrasonograhic (US) localization to differentiate
   malignant from benign breast masses and to compare optical tomography
   with color Doppler US.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the local internal
   review board committee and by the Human Subjects Research Review Board
   of Army Medical Research and Materiel Command. Signed informed consent
   was obtained, and the study was HIPAA compliant. Between May 2003 and
   March 2004, 65 consecutive women (mean age, 51 years; age range, 24-80
   years) with 81 breast lesions underwent US-guided biopsy and were
   scanned with a combined imager. The hand-held probe, which consisted of
   a centrally located US transducer surrounded by near-infrared sensors,
   was used to simultaneously acquire coregistered US images and optical
   data. The lesion location obtained at US was used to guide optical
   imaging reconstruction. Light absorption was measured at two
   wavelengths. From these measurements, tumor angiogenesis was assessed on
   the basis of calculated total hemoglobin concentration. A Student t
   distribution was used to calculate the statistical significance of mean
   maximum and mean average hemoglobin concentrations obtained in malignant
   and benign lesion groups, and P <.001 was considered to indicate a
   statistically significant difference.
   RESULTS: Biopsy results revealed eight early stage invasive carcinomas
   (malignant group) and 73 benign lesions (benign group). The mean maximum
   and mean average hemoglobin concentrations in the malignant group were
   122 mu mol/L +/- 26.8 (+/- standard deviation) and 88 mu mol/L +/- 24.5,
   respectively. The mean maximum and mean average hemoglobin
   concentrations in the benign group were 55 mu mol/L +/- 24.8 and 38 mu
   mol/L +/- 17.4, respectively. Both the maximum and average total
   hemoglobin concentrations were significantly higher in the malignant
   group compared with the benign group (P <.001). When a maximum
   hemoglobin concentration of 95 mu mol/L was used as the threshold value,
   the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
   predictive value of optical tomography were 100\%, 96\%, 73\%, and
   100\%, respectively, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive
   predictive value, and negative predictive value of color Doppler US were
   63\%, 69\%, 19\%, and 94\%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that optical tomography with US
   localization is feasible for differentiating benign and early stage
   malignant breast lesions. (c) RSNA, 2005.}},

Abstract = {{The limitations in existing measures for absorbing pressure impact in

   principle of the oil in a hydrostatic closed pressure chamber, the
   underlying reasons of the pressure impact were analyzed theoretically,
   the intrinsic laws that the extent of the pressure impact in hydraulic
   oil lines are affected by some factors, such as oil elastic modulus, oil
   line's geometrical volume, and changing rate of oil volume versus time
   etc, were discussed. Experimental investigations into pressure impact in
   all pressure chambers because of shifting were conducted under different
   working conditions by employing a special experimental system. The
   effects of shifting time on pressure impact were studied. A new concept
   with universal meaning, i.e. optimal shifting time, and its
   characterizing parameter and the methods of shifting at optimal shifting
   time were also proposed. The results show that shifting time lag Delta t
   is of rationality and maneuverablility. The higher the working pressure,
   the shorter the shifting time.}},

Abstract = {{The resistance, magnetization and strain measurements have been carried
   out on MnFeP0.45 As-0.55 compound. We found that, at variance with what
   is commonly believed, the critical temperature points for the first
   order transition, paramagnetism-ferromagnetism transition, and lattice
   anomaly are not identical. The first order transition goes on in a quite
   wide temperature range with a thermal hysteresis of about 10K. In the
   duration of the first order transition, the paramagnetism-ferromagnetism
   transition is observed, which indicates that they are not related to the
   lattice anomaly. Thus, we attribute it to the continuous change of the
   lattice parameters due to the structure transition based on our
   observation and Zach et al. `s work. On the other hand. the lattice
   anomaly occurs at lower temperature than that of the first order
   structural and magnetic transitions. We conclude that it is a
   magnetostrictive behavior associated with the magnetoelastic coupling
   below the Curie temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To determine whether promising results from phase II studies
   could be reproduced in phase III studies, and to examine which
   characteristics of phase II studies might be of predictive value for

   Methods We searched for all phase III studies of chemotherapy in
   advanced solid malignancies, published in the English language
   literature from July 1998 to June 2003. Each phase III study was
   reviewed to identify preceding phase II studies. Phase II and phase III
   studies included in this analysis must have used identical regimens.
   Data were extracted from both phase II and phase III studies.
   Results Of 181 phase III studies identified, 43 used therapeutic
   regimens identical to those in 49 preceding phase II studies. Twelve
   phase III studies (28\%) were ``positive.{''} The vast majority (81\%)
   of phase III studies have lower response rates than preceding phase II
   studies, with a mean difference of 12.9\% among all studies analyzed.
   None of the phase II study characteristics evaluated significantly
   predicted for ``positive{''} phase III studies, but the sample size of
   phase II studies demonstrated a trend toward being predictive (P =.083).
   Conclusion Promising results from phase II studies frequently do not

   phase III studies are lower than those in preceding phase II studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from a novel technique allowing continuous
   monitoring through multiple storm events of interstitial flow in
   salmonid redds. Previous studies have shown that long-term increases in
   fine sediment inputs into rivers can silt up spawning beds, reduce
   intergravel flow and threaten egg survival. Not enough is known,
   however, about the temporal and spatial scales of the physical processes
   affecting spawning habitat. The short-term sensitivity of intergravel
   flow through salmon nests to low-intensity sediment transport events has
   not been documented. Furthermore, it is unclear if the egg pocket flow
   vital to incubation is principally controlled by the hydraulic
   conductivity of the redd patch or by that, generally lower, of the
   ambient riffle substrate. The purpose of this study was to determine if
   individual runoff events could affect intergravel flow in salmon nests
   and to investigate the sensitivity of interstitial flow to the fines
   content and conductivity of the redd patch.
   During the summer and autumn of 2001, a new intergravel velocity sensor
   based on the hot wire principle made it possible to continuously
   monitor, over five months, interstitial velocities in artificial redds
   in four tributaries of the Cascapedia River, Quebec. Fifteen low and
   moderate intensity runoff events (up to 50\% bankfull) were monitored.
   Data were obtained for each storm on suspended sediment transport as
   well as sand infiltration rates in sediment collectors emplaced in redd
   zones. It was found that redd interstitial velocities were reduced
   whenever a runoff event deposited more than 7 kg/m(2) of sands in
   infiltration traps. In addition, redd interstitial velocities were
   reduced four out of the five times that the event-integrated suspended
   sediment dose exceeded 7mg l(-1) day (dose is defined as the area under
   the concentration time curve). In the study conditions, where ambient
   riffle sediment has relatively moderate permeability and localized
   groundwater upwelling is negligible, our data suggest that significant
   intergravel flow (0.1-0.6 mm/s) can be triggered through 2 m long redd
   patches, in response to the redd-scale water surface gradient and the
   relatively higher conductivity of the redd patch, after spawner
   activity. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   VDRKO littermates were fed a high calcium diet to prevent disturbances
   in calcium homeostasis and were gavaged with dimethylbenzanthracence

   WT littermates, VDRKO mice exhibited an increased incidence of mammary
   gland hyperplasia and a higher percentage of hormone independent tumors
   with squamous differentiation. VDR ablation also significantly enhanced
   tumor development in epidermis and lymphoid tissues, but did not affect
   tumor development in ovary, uterus, lung or liver. These data indicate
   that VDR ablation alters susceptibility to DMBA-induced carcinogenesis

Abstract = {{It is an assertion routinely made that the rise of Chan represents a new
   stage in the development of Chinese Buddhism. But there can be no
   philosophical breakthrough without the discovery of new conceptual tools
   or perspectives. The histories and philosophical meanings of three
   language-related Chan methods are explored here; it is shown that not
   only are the methods vital to our understanding of Chan Buddhism but
   also they explain why Chan is so different from anything Chinese
   philosophy had seen up until the rise of Chan.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{4, S}},
Pages = {{40-44}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Epicardial potentials reveal the strong effects of fiber
   anisotropy, rotation, imbrication, and coupling on propagation in the
   intact heart. From the patterns of the surface potentials, we can obtain
   information about the local fiber orientation, anisotropy, the
   transmural fiber rotation, and which direction the wave front is
   traveling through the wall. In this study, lessons learned front
   epicardia) potential mapping of large hearts were applied to studies
   conducted in genetically altered mouse hearts.
   Methods: An inducible model of the overexpression of a gain-of-function
   alpha 5 integrin (cytoplasmic domain truncation) was created in mouse.
   After 3 days of administration of doxycycline, the animals exhibited an
   altered electrical phenotype of markedly reduced amplitude of the QRS
   complex on the surface electrocardiogram. Epicardial potentials were
   recorded from Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts with alpha 5 integrin
   gain-of-function mutations and from wild-type (WT) control hearts. A
   cylindrical electrode array consisting of 184 sites with 1-mm uniform
   interelectrode spacing was placed around the heart, and unipolar
   electrograms were recorded during atrial and ventricular stimulation at
   different basic cycle lengths.
   Results: The total ventricular activation time for the transgenic
   animals was greater than that of the WT hearts for atrial and
   ventricular pacing locations. The isopotential maps from the mutated
   hearts showed a loss of anisotropy, as revealed by the more rounded and
   less elliptically shaped wave fronts seen immediately after epicardial
   point stimulation when compared with WT hearts. The weaker potential
   maxima in the mutated hearts did not exhibit the normal expansion and
   rotation associated with an advancing wave front in a normal heart,
   suggesting abnormalities in myocyte coupling in these hearts.
   Isopotential maps provided additional information about fiber
   architecture from the electric field that was not obtained from optical
   recordings alone. These findings provided a phenotypic characterization
   and specific insights into the mechanisms of the electrical
   abnormalities associated with altered integrin signaling in cardiac
   myocytes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Harmattan dust deposition and particle size in Ghana}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{In Ghana, a dust-laden Harmattan wind blows from the Sahara from
   November to March. Some of the dust is trapped in the vegetation, in the
   lakes and other inland waters, while the rest is blown further away into
   the Ivory Coast or into the Atlantic Ocean. Several methods have been
   used to trap the Harmattan dust, mainly bowls with or without water, but
   also plates or sheets of various materials have been used. This paper
   compares three different methods to trap the Harmattan dust and
   describes the differences in amount and particle size distribution of
   dust trapped in various agroecological zones. The investigation shows
   that bowls with water trap more dust than plastic mats with 1.5 cm straw
   which again trap more dust than wooden plates. The bowl values can be
   used as a measure of the total Harmattan dust deposition, the mat values
   can be used as a measure of how much Harmattan dust is retained by
   vegetation, while the plates provide a measure of how much dust is
   retained on vegetation free areas. The amount of Harmattan dust captured
   is largest in the north, the amount of dust retained differs
   significantly from year to year, and a severe Harmattan in the north is
   not necessary coincident with severe Harmattan in the south. The dust
   particle size becomes finer towards the south and with increasing
   amounts of organic matter, and the particle size distribution shows that
   the major part of the dust trapped is long-term suspended material with
   a significant input of local dust. The dust particle size is coarser on
   the mats than in the bowls due to re-suspension from the mats. The
   presence of diatoms in the samples from Bawku indicates that a
   substantial part of the dust originates from former lakes in the Sahara.
   The amount of dust retained in the north gives a deposition rate of
   about 15 mm per 1000 years. This may explain why loess layers have not
   developed in Ghana. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the possibilities of adapting artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) to predict the dimensionless parameters related to the
   maximum contact pressures of an elasticity problem. The plane symmetric
   double receding contact problem for a rigid stamp and two elastic strips
   having different elastic constants and heights is considered. The
   external load is applied to the upper elastic strip by means of a rigid
   stamp and the lower elastic strip is bonded to a rigid support. The
   problem is solved under the assumptions that the contact between two
   elastic strips also between the rigid stamp and the upper elastic strip
   are frictionless, the effect of gravity force is neglected and only
   compressive normal tractions can be transmitted through the interfaces.
   A three layered ANN with backpropagation (BP) algorithm is utilized for
   prediction of the dimensionless parameters related to the maximum
   contact pressures. Training and testing patterns are formed by using the
   theory of elasticity with integral transformation technique. ANN
   predictions and theoretical solutions are compared and seen that ANN
   predictions are quite close to the theoretical solutions. It is
   demonstrated that ANNs is a suitable numerical tool and if properly
   used, can reduce time consumed.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, multi-pass shape rolling of bars, sections and rails is
   considered from theoretical point of view, first of all. For such a
   process, the material is subjected to the thermo-mechanical processing.
   The theoretical basis of such a process consists of mathematical
   modelling of metal flow, temperature and microstructural evolution, as
   well as the prediction of the final properties of sections. It allows
   the computer simulation of controlled rolling of products with very
   complicated cross-section shapes. The coupled
   thermo-mechanical-microstructural model, which is the main subject of
   the paper, can be split into several independent parts:
   thermo-mechanical processing, austenite microstructure evolution during
   thermo-mechanical steel treatment, pearlite transformation model and
   microstructural-mechanical properties. The mechanical part of the model
   uses a generalised plane-strain (GPS) approach, which allows savings in
   both the computing time and computer memory. The temperature
   distribution in the controlled volume at any stage is achieved by means
   of a non-steady-state solution of the general diffusion equation
   satisfying the coupled Neuman and Hankel boundary conditions. The
   microstructural evolution model predicts static recrystallisation to
   restore the austenite microstructure after deformation and dynamic
   recrystallisation; while the deformation temperatures and strain exceed
   the critical values at the same time as the metal is subjected to the
   deformation. In the processes considered, the static recrystallisation
   and austenite grain growth are the main processes, which determine the
   final austenite grain size. The majority of the paper is dedicated to
   theoretical considerations; some results of the modelling are also
   presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present results from a numerical conduit model of nonequilibrium
   magma degassing. We show that CO2/H2O concentration ratios in
   pyroclastic obsidian from the ca. 1340 A.D. Mono Craters eruption may
   record nonequilibrium degassing during magma ascent. Our results also
   indicate that permeability-controlled, open-system gas loss is
   consistent with obsidian formation and promotes nonequilibrium degassing
   at shallow depths. Because of the low diffusivity of CO2 relative to
   H2O, We find that CO2 concentrations can remain above equilibrium during
   magma ascent. To reproduce Mono Craters volatile concentrations, our
   model does not require volatile supersaturation, or an exsolved gas
   phase, prior to magma eruption. We estimate magmatic volatile contents
   of approximately 400 ppm CO2 and 4.6 wt.\% H2O. However, nonequilibrium
   is contingent upon low rates of bubble nucleation to shallow depths, so
   that average bubble number densities are of order 10(11) m(-3) during 3
   most of the magma ascent. If bubble number densities during ascent of
   the Mono Craters magma were greater than 10(11) m(-3) degassing was in
   equilibrium and a CO2-rich vapor buffer is required to reproduce
   observed CO2/H2O concentration ratios. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Powder metallurgy (PM) is a well-established method for manufacturing
   ferrous precision parts. Sintering is one of the important production
   steps and can be strongly enhanced (activated) by formation of a liquid
   phase during the sintering process. The liquid phase can be reached by
   the addition of alloying elements (e.g., copper) or sintering activators
   (e.g., phosphorus) and is formed by melting of eutectic phase mixtures
   or by incipient melting. The main investigations presented in this work
   are done by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS): 2D and 3D elemental
   distribution. Additionally, impact energy and hardness measurements were
   performed in order to study the influence of phosphorus on mechanical
   properties. The concentration of P in different samples was varied
   between 0 and 1 weight percent (wt.\%), the carbon content was
   consistently 0.5 wt.\%. Nominal specimens were sintered at 1120 and 1250
   degrees C in protective atmosphere of flowing nitrogen to determine the

Abstract = {{The LFMO (localized fragment molecular orbital) and NBO (natural bond
   orbital) basis sets are constructed. In the LFMO basis set, the sigma
   and pi systems are completely separated out, and each LFMO is absolutely
   localized on its own fragment. But, an NBO is only concentrated on its
   own fragment when it is expressed as the linear combination of AOs.
   Afterwards, the Morokum's SCF energy partition and the NBO energetic
   analysis are performed, over each of the LFMO and NBO basis sets, for
   the molecules in order to calculate their vertical resonance energy
   (Delta E-V). As shown by the theoretical data presented in this work,
   Delta E-V for molecule C6B6H6 is always destabilizing when it is
   obtained from the NBO energetic analysis over each of the LFMO and NBO
   basis sets, and the pi interaction between fragments has no effect on
   the energy of the sigma system (Delta E-sigma = 0). But, the values of
   Delta E-V, over the LFMO and NBO basis sets, are rather different. In
   the case, of the Morokuma's SCF energy partition, however, Delta E not
   equal 0 due to the electron coupling between the pi and sigma systems.
   As a result, Delta E-V for Molecule C6B6H6 become stabilizing, and Delta
   E-V obtained from the Morokuma's energy partition over the NBO basis set
   is greater in the absolute value than that over the LFMO basis set,
   indicating that the difference, in the degree of the localization,
   between the LFMO and NBO basis sets has a great effect on the electron
   coupling. In molecule C12H6, the vertical resonance energy Delta E-V,
   obtained from the NBO energetic analysis over each of the LFMO and NBO
   basis set, is always stabilizing. On the contrary, Delta E-V, obtained
   from the Morokum's energy partition over the NBO basis set, is
   stabilizing, but that, over the LFMO basis set, is destabilizing.
   According to the 4N + 2 rule, the NBO basis set is unreasonable for the,
   energy partition, and the NBO energetic analysis is unable to provide
   molecule with an reliable Delta E-V because it neglects the strong
   coupling between the pi and sigma systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Porous materials play an important role in today's society. For a wide
   variety of industrial markets including filtration, aeration, sorbents,
   structural materials and sensors, porous materials are essential
   components. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel techniques that
   can produce improved porosity in materials at lower production costs.
   The use of biologically active agents during material processing can
   influence the structures of materials on the micro- or nano-level and
   could provide many potential improvements over existing porous materials
   processing techniques. In this paper, we report on the use of a novel
   technique to produce controlled porosity in polymer materials, by
   incorporating a biologically active agent. The biological agent chosen
   for demonstration of the process was a single cell fungus (a common
   example of which is yeast), but extension to other types of biological
   agents is evident from the results. Also, potential application of this
   technique to other materials system, including powdered metals,
   ceramics, and solution-derived materials (such as sol-gel systems) is
   discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is the major cytosolic receptor for
   nitric oxide (NO) that converts GTP into the second messenger cGMP in a
   NO-dependent manner. Other factors controlling this key enzyme are
   intracellular proteins such as Hsp90 and PSD95, which bind to sGC and
   modulate its activity, stability, and localization. To date little is
   known about the effects of posttranslational modifications of sGC,
   although circumstantial evidence suggests that reversible
   phosphorylation may contribute to sGC regulation. Here we demonstrate
   that inhibitors of protein-tyrosine phosphatases such as pervanadate and
   bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline) oxovanadate( V) as well as reactive
   oxygen species such as H2O2 induce specific tyrosine phosphorylation of
   the beta(1) but not of the alpha(1) subunit of sGC. Tyrosine
   phosphorylation of sGC beta(1) is also inducible by pervanadate and H2O2
   in intact PC12 cells, rat aortic smooth muscle cells, and in rat aortic
   tissues, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of sGC may also occur
   in vivo. We have mapped the major tyrosine phosphorylation site to
   position 192 of beta(1), where it forms part of a highly acidic
   phospho-acceptor site for Src-like kinases. In the phosphorylated state
   Tyr(P)-192 exposes a docking site for SH2 domains and efficiently
   recruits Src and Fyn to sGC beta(1), thereby promoting multiple
   phosphorylation of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that sGC is
   subject to tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction with Src-like
   kinases, revealing an unexpected cross-talk between the NO/cGMP and
   tyrosine kinase signaling pathways at the level of sGC.}},

   NOS loose dimer shows an altered association state with severely

   dimers to tight dimers in solution and crystals. Mutations at key
   positions in the dimer interface that distinguish prokaryotic from

Abstract = {{Group A rotaviruses are established agents of disease in buffalo calves.
   Early epidemiological studies in Italian buffalo herds revealed the
   predominance of strains with G8 specificity and detected strains with
   the rare, RRV-Iike, VP4 P{[}3] genotype. To acquire additional
   information on the VP4 and VP7 specificities of buffalo rotaviruses, a
   total of 125 fecal samples were collected from buffalo calves affected
   with diarrhoea, in seven dairy farms in Southern Italy. Rotaviruses were
   detected in 21 samples (16.8\%) by an immunochromatographic assay and by
   reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Analysis of the VP7 gene revealed
   that 57\% (12 of 21) of the isolates were G6, 23.8\% were G8 (5 of 21)
   and 19\% (4 of 2 1) were G10. Analysis of the VP4 revealed that 71.4\%
   (15 of 21) of the isolates were P{[}5] and that 28.6\% (6 of 21) were
   P{[}1]. The most common combination of G and P types was P{[}5],G6
   (57\%), followed by P{[}1],G 10 (19\%), P{[}5],G8 (14\%) and P{[}1],G8
   (9.5\%). While P{[}5],G6 rotaviruses are very common in Italian bovine
   herds, the antigenic combination P{[}1],G 10 is unusual and presumably
   derives from reassortment between P{[}1] and G 10 strains, that appear
   to be more frequent in buffaloes and bovines, respectively. The presence
   of bovine-like G and P serotypes suggests that in Italy the epidemiology
   of buffalo rotaviruses overlaps the epidemiology of bovine rotaviruses,
   presumably because of the strict species affinity and/or of the
   intermingled distribution over the same geographical areas of the
   buffalo and bovine herds. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2005}},

Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{IL-1 beta is a pleotropic cytokine that may mediate increased
   procoagulant activity and permeability in endothelial tissue during
   inflammatory conditions. The procoagulant effects of IL-1 beta are
   mediated through induction of tissue factor (TF) but its alterations on
   vascular permeability are not well characterized. We found that IL-1
   beta induced a rapid and dose-dependent increase in TF activity in human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) under routine culture conditions.
   However, IL-1 beta caused a rapid and marked increase in permeability
   across confluent EC monolayers using a two-compartment in vitro model
   only in the presence of factor VIII-deficient plasma that was completely
   abrogated by neutralizing anti-TF antibody pre-treatment. In vitro
   permeability was associated with loss of EC surface expression of
   VE-cadherin and contraction of F-actin cytoskeletal elements that
   resulted in EC intercellular gap formation. These data demonstrate that
   IL-1 beta induces marked changes in permeability across activated
   endothelium via a TF dependent mechanism and suggest that modulation of
   TF activity may represent a strategy to treat various acute and chronic
   inflammatory conditions mediated by this cytokine.}},

Abstract = {{Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that regulate macrophage
   cholesterol efflux by inducing ATP-binding cassette transporter A1
   (ABCA1) and ABCG1/ABCG4 gene expression. The Niemann-Pick C (NPC)
   proteins NPC1 and NPC2 are located in the late endosome, where they
   control cholesterol trafficking to the plasma membrane. The mobilization
   of cholesterol from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane is a
   determinant governing its availability for efflux to extracellular
   acceptors. Here we investigated the influence of LXR activation on
   intracellular cholesterol trafficking in primary human macrophages.
   Synthetic LXR activators increase the amount of free cholesterol in the
   plasma membrane by inducing NPC1 and NPC2 gene expression. Moreover,
   ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux induced by LXR activators was
   drastically decreased in the presence of progesterone, which blocks
   postlysosomal cholesterol trafficking, and reduced when NPC1 and NPC2
   mRNA expression was depleted using small interfering RNA. The
   stimulation of cholesterol mobilization to the plasma membrane by LXRs
   led to a decrease in cholesteryl ester formation and Acyl-coenzyme A
   cholesterol acyltransferase-1 activity. These data indicate that LXR
   activation enhances cholesterol trafficking to the plasma membrane,
   where it becomes available for efflux, at the expense of esterification,
   thus contributing to the overall effects of LXR agonists in the control
   of macrophage cholesterol homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{Gap junctions (GJs) constituted by neighboring cardiac myocytes are
   essential for gating ions and small molecules to coordinate cardiac
   contractions. cAMP is suggested to be a potent stimulus for enhancement
   of GJ function. However, it remains elusive how cAMP potentiates the GJ
   of cardiomyocytes. Here we demonstrated that the gating function of GJ
   is enhanced by the protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent signal, and that the
   accumulation of connexin43 (Cx43), the most abundant Cx in myocytes, is
   enhanced by an exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) (Rap1
   activator)-dependent signal. The gating function of GJs was analyzed by
   microinjected dye transfer method. The accumulation of Cx43 was analyzed
   by quantitative immunostaining. Using the PKA-specific activator
   N-6-benzoyladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (6Bnz) and Epac-specific
   activator 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2'-O-methyladenosine-3',5'-cyclic
   monophosphate (8CPT), we could delineate the two important downstream
   signals of cAMP for enhanced GJ neoformation. Whereas 6Bnz potentiated
   gating function of GJs with slight accumulation of Cx43 at cell-cell
   contacts, 8CPT remarkably enhanced the accumulation of Cx43 with a
   slight effect on gating. We further noticed that adherens junctions
   (AJs) were maturated by 8CPT, as marked by increased neural-cadherin
   immunostaining. Because AJ formation precedes the GJ formation, AJ
   formation accelerated by Epac-Rap1 signal may result in enhanced GJ
   formation. The involvement of Epac-Rap1 signal in GJ neoformation was
   further confirmed by evidence that inactivation of Rap1 by
   overexpression of Rap1GAP1b perturbed the accumulation of Cx43 at
   cell-cell contacts. Collectively, PKA and Epac cooperatively enhance
   functional GJ neoformation in cardiomyocytes.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{110}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] The upper atmosphere dynamics in the polar cap is mainly driven by
   ion-drag momentum sources imposed by the mapping of magnetosphere
   convection into the thermosphere/ionosphere and by Joule and auroral
   particle heating. Auroral particles also enhance conductivity
   particularly in the middle and lower ionosphere. Changes in the
   magnetospheric energy and momentum sources can significantly modify the
   wind circulation during geomagnetic storms. To observe these effects, a
   Michelson interferometer has been installed in Svalbard to measure winds
   in the thermosphere. Prior to 30 October 2003, cloud cover over Svalbard
   rendered the conditions unfavorable for optical observation. However,
   meteorological conditions improved after this date to enable the
   thermospheric response to the 28 October coronal mass ejection to be
   made. During quiet geomagnetic conditions measured wind velocities were
   in good agreement with those predicted by the Horizontal Wind Model
   (HWM). During disturbed geomagnetic conditions, HWM tended to
   underestimate the observed velocities. Comparison of the wind
   observations with a physical model tended to show reasonable agreement
   during both the strongly driven and recovery phase of the storm.
   Although the physical model did not always capture the timing of the
   rapid changes in the wind response in the early phase of the storm, the
   amplitudes of the fluctuations were in good agreement. After the initial
   phase the physical model agreed well with both the timing and amplitude
   of the meridional and zonal wind fluctuations. The meridional wind
   component was also derived from the EISCAT Svalbard Radar ion velocity
   and was found to be in close agreement with the optical winds
   observations.}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-22}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{In the Sahelian zone of West-Africa, erosion by both wind and water
   causes a serious decline in fertility of the already low fertile soils.
   Despite the fact that the flow of nutrients has been intensively
   investigated by the use of nutrient balances, little attention has been
   paid to the contribution of the soil erosion to the nutrient balance.
   Two physically based models (WEPS and EUROSEM, both written in PCRaster)
   were extended with nutrient modules to investigate the role of wind and
   water erosion in tire loss and gain of nutrients at the scale of a
   Sabetian field. The models are applied at three geomorphic units in the
   Katchari catchment in northern Burkina Faso.
   WEPS can predict spatial patterns of erosion and deposition due to
   wind-blown particle transport. Depending on wind direction, crusting and
   vegetation cover net erosion or deposition can occur. When erosion
   occurs considerable amounts of nutrients are lost, but when deposition
   occurs, most of these nutrients may be regained. Soil loss by water
   erosion is closely related to the crust type present, which regulates
   infiltration and thus runoff. Nutrient losses by water erosion are small
   compared with those by wind erosion, but are forever lost for the area.
   Sediment transport by wind in saltation mode results in the largest soil
   and nutrient loss at the time scale of an event. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A novel Pt counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) was
   prepared by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 on NiP-plated glass
   substrate. The charge-transfer kinetic properties of the platinized
   NiP-plated glass electrode (Pt/NiP electrode) for triiodide reduction

   has the advantage over the platinized FTO conducting glass electrode
   (Pt/FTO electrode) in increasing the light reflectance and reducing the
   sheet resistance leading to improve the light harvest efficiency and the
   fill factor of the dye-sensitized solar cells effectively. The
   photon-to-current efficiency and the overall conversion efficiency of
   DSC using PUMP counter electrode is increased by 20\% and 33\%,
   respectively, compared to that of using Pt/FTO counter electrode.
   Examination of the anodic dissolution and the long-term test on the

Abstract = {{We reported an asymmetric supercapacitor technology where RuO2/TiO2
   nanotube composite was used as positive electrode and the activated
   carbon as negative electrode in 1mol/L KOH electrolyte solution. The
   electrochemical capacitance performance of the asymmetric supercapacitor
   was tested by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The results show that the
   asymmetric supercapacitor has electrochemical capacitance performance
   within potential range 0-1.4 V. A power density 1207 W/kg was obtained
   with an energy density of 5.7 W h/kg at a charge-discharge current
   density of 120 mA/cm(2). The supercapacitor also exhibits a good cycling
   performance and keep 90\% of initial capacity over 1000 cycles. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Previously, we reported that BRCA1 strongly represses the
   transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor-alpha(ER-alpha) in human
   breast and prostate cancer cells but only weakly inhibits ER-alpha in
   cervical cancer cells. We now report that introduction of the human
   papillomavirus E7 or E6 oncogenes into human papillomavirus- negative
   cells rescues the BRCA1 repression of ER-alpha activity and that the E7
   and E6 oncoproteins interact directly with BRCA1 in vitro and associate
   with BRCA1 in vivo in cultured cells. This interaction involves at least
   two contact points on BRCA1, one within an N-terminal site shown
   previously to interact with ER-alpha and the other in a C-terminal
   region of BRCA1 containing the first BRCA1 C-terminal domain. Point
   mutations within the zinc finger domains of E7 and E6 inactivated the
   binding to the N terminus of BRCA1 and reduced their ability to rescue
   BRCA1 inhibition of ER-alpha. E6 and E7 also antagonized the ability of
   BRCA1 to inhibit c-MycE-box-mediated transactivation and human
   telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter activity, in a manner
   dependent upon the zinc finger domains. Finally, the ability of E6 and
   E7 to antagonize BRCA1 did not involve proteolytic degradation of BRCA1.
   These findings suggest functional interactions of BRCA1 with E7 and E6.
   The potential significance of these findings is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The helicity dependence of the total cross section for the (gamma) over
   right arrow(p) over right arrow -> p pi(0)pi(0) reaction has been
   measured for the first time at incident photon energies from 400 to 800
   MeV. The measurement, performed at the tagged photon beam facility of
   the MAMI accelerator in Mainz, used the large acceptance detector DAPHNE
   and a longitudinally polarized frozen-spin target. This channel is found
   to be excited predominantly when the photon and proton have a parallel
   spin orientation, most likely due to the intermediate production of the
   D-13(1520) resonance. However, the contribution of the antiparallel spin
   configuration, arising from other reaction mechanisms, is also not
   negligible. This result gives important new information to resolve the
   existing model discrepancies in the identification of the nucleon
   resonances contributing to this channel. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The gene encoding histamine dehydrogenase in Rhizobium sp. 4-9 has been
   cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The coding region of the
   gene was 2079 bp and encoded a protein of 693 amino acids with a
   calculated molecular mass of 76,732 Da. This histamine dehydrogenase was
   related to histamine dehydrogenase from Nocardioides simplex (54.5\%
   identical), trimethylamine dehydrogenase from Methylophilus
   methylotrophus (39.3\% identical) and dimethylamine dehydrogenase from
   Hyphomicrobium X (38. 1\% identical), which have a covalent
   6-S-cysteinyl flavin mononucleotide and a {[}4Fe-4S] cluster as redox
   cofactors. Sequence alignment and a UV-visible absorption spectrum
   supported the presence of these cofactors in this histamine
   dehydrogenase. The investigation of the enzymatic properties suggested
   that this enzyme exhibited the most excellent substrate specificity
   toward histamine among all amine oxidases or dehydrogenases found to
   date. The recombinant enzyme was able to be used for the colorimetric
   determination of histamine, which gave a linear calibration curve and
   identical data with conventional methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   the general strategy of building the Markov chain models and
   computational analysis of characteristics of a process is described, and
   some examples of application of the approach to model grinding,
   classification, grinding with internal classification, mixing,
   agglomeration, etc, are shown. The use of multidimensional models to
   consider simultaneously different properties is emphasised. The approach
   also allows taking into account non-linear phenomena, which are very
   typical of particulate processes but are very seldom considered in usual

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to characterise the activated carbon produced
   from wood and its basic components: cellulose, lignin and xylan
   (hemicelluloses). Two ways of activation were tested: simple pyrolysis
   under N-2 and thermal treatment of the material impregnated with KOH
   (KOH-activation). Concerning the pyrolysis, simultaneous measurements of
   DTA-TGA allowed to compare the heat of reaction and the decomposition
   rate of the 3 wood components. Moreover it was shown that only the char
   from cellulose has a significant BET-surface area of pores. The
   KOH-activated carbons from wood and wood components were characterised
   by their BET surface area, their spectra in temperature programmed
   desorption (TPD) up to 1173 K and by their capacity to adsorb pollutant
   compounds in aqueous phase such as phenol and methylene blue. It was
   shown that the theoretical models of Langmuir and Freundlich
   satisfactorily fit to the adsorption isotherms of these pollutants,
   moreover most of the parameters of these theoretical models rank as the
   BET-surface area of pores. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The conditioning of industrial powders or granulates is strongly
   dependent on their behaviour with respect to the atmospheric humidity.
   Adsorption and capillary condensation of water vapour at the points of
   contact between particles change the theology of the powder and may
   result in the formation of aggregates with high mechanical resistance.
   In some cases water vapour causes partial dissolution of powder, as in
   the case of the hygroscopic fertilizer Ammonium Nitrate. Additives used
   as caking inhibitors are expected to act in one or both of following
   directions:
   - slackening the adsorption of water vapour and/or the dissolution of
   the particles in conditions of high humidity;
   - inhibition of the nucleation and growth during the recrystallisation
   of the powder in a dry atmosphere.
   An experimental method was developed which allowed following of the
   kinetics of the cycle, absorption of water vapour and formation of
   solution - evaporation of water - nucleation and growth of the
   recrystallized solid. The method is based on the variation of mass of
   powder sample placed in a flow of water vapour with known partial
   pressure at constant temperature. A model is proposed, based on the
   kinetic theory of gases, able to assess quantitatively the
   sorption/dissolution kinetics of powders exposed to high atmospheric
   humidity, just as the evaporation of the absorbed water and, eventually,
   the recrystallisation of the dissolved solid when the humidity is low.
   The effect of addition of Fuchsine acid (known anti-caking agent for
   Ammonium Nitrate) on that kinetics is found to be nil as regards the
   dissolution and the nucleation but slakes the subsequent
   recrystallisation during powder drying. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) has
   essential roles in adipogenesis and glucose homeostasis, and is a
   molecular target of insulin-sensitizing drugs(1-3). Although the ability
   of PPAR-gamma agonists to antagonize inflammatory responses by
   transrepression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) target genes is
   linked to antidiabetic(4) and antiatherogenic actions(5), the mechanisms
   remain poorly understood. Here we report the identification of a
   molecular pathway by which PPAR-gamma represses the transcriptional
   activation of inflammatory response genes in mouse macrophages. The
   initial step of this pathway involves ligand-dependent SUMOylation of
   the PPAR-gamma ligand-binding domain, which targets PPAR-gamma to
   nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR)-histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3)
   complexes on inflammatory gene promoters. This in turn prevents
   recruitment of the ubiquitylation/19S proteosome machinery that normally
   mediates the signal-dependent removal of corepressor complexes required
   for gene activation. As a result, NCoR complexes are not cleared from
   the promoter and target genes are maintained in a repressed state. This
   mechanism provides an explanation for how an agonist-bound nuclear
   receptor can be converted from an activator of transcription to a
   promoter-specific repressor of NF-kappa B target genes that regulate
   immunity and homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of the noncatalyzed and reagent-catalyzed Bazarov
   synthesis of urea has extensively been investigated in the gas phase by
   means of density functional (B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)) and high quality ab
   initio (CBS-QB3) computational techniques. It was found that the first
   step of urea formation from NH3(g) and CO2(g) corresponds to a simple
   addition reaction leading to the carbamic acid intermediate, a process
   being slightly endothermic. Among the three possible reaction mechanisms
   considered, the addition-elimination addition (AEA) and the double
   addition-elimination (DAE) mechanisms are almost equally favored, while
   the concerted (C) one was predicted kinetically forbidden. The second
   step involves the formation of loose adducts between NH3 and carbamic
   acid corresponding to an ammonium carbamate intermediate, which
   subsequently dehydrates to urea. The formation of ``ammonium
   carbamate{''} corresponds to an almost thermoneutral process, whereas
   its dehydration, which is the rate-determining step, is highly
   endothermic. The Bazarov synthesis of urea is strongly assisted by the
   active participation of extra NH3 or H2O molecules (autocatalysis). For
   all reaction pathways studied the entire geometric and energetic
   profiles were computed and thoroughly analyzed. The reaction scheme
   described herein can be related with the formation of both isocyanic
   acid, H-N=C=O, and carbamic acid, H2N-COOH, as key intermediates in the
   initial formation of organic molecules, such as urea, under prebiotic
   conditions.}},

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to make rationing of elective surgery in the publicly
   funded health system more explicit, New Zealand has developed a booking
   system for surgery using clinical priority assessment criteria (CPAC).
   This paper is based on research undertaken to evaluate the use of CPAC.
   To explore whether the goals of explicit rationing were being met 69
   interviews were undertaken with policy advisors, administrators and
   clinicians in six localities throughout New Zealand. The aims of
   reforming policy for access to elective surgery included improving
   equity, providing clarity for patients, and achieving a paradigm shift
   by relating likely benefit from surgery to the available resources. The
   research suggests that there have been changes in the way in which
   patients access elective surgery and that in many ways rationing has
   become more explicit. However, there is also some resistance to the use
   of CPAC, in part due to confusion over whether the tools are
   decision-aids or protocols, what role the tools play in achieving equity
   and differences between financial thresholds for access to surgery and
   clinical thresholds for benefit from surgery. For many surgical
   specialties implicit rationing will continue to play a major part in
   determining access to surgery unless validated and reliable CPAC tools
   can be developed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An efficient intrathecal delivery of small interfering RNA to the spinal
   cord and peripheral neurons}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR PAIN}},
Year = {{2005}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a highly effective method for in vivo gene silencing
   in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) by a cationic lipid
   facilitated delivery of synthetic, small interfering RNA ( siRNA). A
   siRNA to the delta opioid receptor (DOR), or a mismatch RNA, was mixed
   with the transfection reagent, i-Fect (TM) ( vehicle), and delivered as
   repeated daily bolus doses (0.5 mu g to 4 mu g) via implanted
   intrathecal catheter to the lumbar spinal cord of rats. Twenty-four
   hours after the last injection, rats were tested for antinociception by
   the DOR selective agonist, {[}D-Ala(2), Glu(4)] deltorphin II ( DELT),
   or the mu opioid receptor ( MOR) selective agonist, {[}D-Ala(2),
   N-Me-Phe(4), Gly-ol(5)] enkephalin ( DAMGO). Pretreatment with the
   siRNA, but not the mismatch RNA or vehicle alone, blocked DELT
   antinociception dose-dependently. The latter was concomitant with a
   reduction in the spinal immunoreactivity and receptor density of DOR,
   and in DOR transcripts in the lumbar DRG and spinal dorsal horn. Neither
   siRNA nor mismatch RNA pretreatment altered spinal immunoreactivity of
   MOR or antinociception by spinal DAMGO, and had no effect on the
   baseline thermal nociceptive threshold. The inhibition of function and
   expression of DOR by siRNA was reversed by 72 hr after the last RNA
   injection. The uptake of fluorescence-tagged siRNA was detected in both
   DRG and spinal cord. The low effective dose of siRNA/i-Fect (TM) complex
   reflects an efficient delivery of the siRNA to peripheral and spinal
   neurons, produced no behavioral signs of toxicity. This delivery method
   may be optimized for other gene targets.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{D18}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] Seasonal variations of the meridional ozone transport and their
   contributions to the total ozone amount are investigated in terms of
   mass-weighted isentropic zonal means and eddies of ozone flux.
   Three-dimensional data obtained using a chemical transport model are
   used to estimate transport fluxes. The mean ozone transport decreases
   the total ozone amount in the tropics and increases it in the
   extratropics, since the stratospheric poleward ozone transport due to
   the Brewer-Dobson circulation is much greater than the lower
   tropospheric equatorward transport. The mean ozone flux convergence
   centered near the pole in the Northern Hemisphere has considerable
   seasonal variation with a maximum in late winter. The flux convergence
   is centered outside of the polar vortex in the Southern Hemisphere, and
   its seasonal variation is somewhat small. In addition, the Brewer-Dobson
   circulation causes a seasonal variation of the tropical divergence,
   which is greatest in the northern winter. The eddy ozone transport is
   mostly equatorward in the lower stratosphere and troposphere, since the
   extratropical downward transport forms the isentropic poleward gradient
   of the ozone mixing ratio. It decreases the total ozone amount in the
   extratropics and increases it in the tropics. The eddy transport
   contributes less to seasonal variation of the total ozone amount;
   however, a strong poleward eddy transport increases it near the
   Antarctic in late spring. The transport characteristics are discussed in
   detail during and after breakdown of the Antarctic polar vortex.}},

   only on selected parameters, such as the spin-asymmetry function for the
   scattering of a spin-polarized electron beam from an unpolarized target
   beam, while they are almost invisible in the (pseudo-) Stokes parameters
   that can be measured either in an electron-photon coincidence setup or

Abstract = {{A series of zeolite (H-ZSM-5)-supported molybdenum nitride catalysts
   with Mo loading ranging from 2 to 30 wt.\% were synthesized by
   temperature-programmed nitridation in a flow of NH3. The surface
   properties of the nitride samples were characterized by XPS, H-2-TPR,
   and XRD techniques and their catalytic activities were evaluated for NO
   reduction with H-2. For the fresh samples, molybdenum nitrides coexisted
   with oxides on the zeolite. With the increase of Mo loading from 2 to 30
   wt.\%, the degree of nitridation increased linearly with the increase of
   Mo loading. We observed that a catalyst with higher Mo loading exhibited
   higher initial activities. The nitrided 2 wt.\% Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalyst was
   the most stable and NO conversion to N-2 remained unchanged within a
   test period of 15 h. For the catalysts with Mo loading above 2 wt.\%,
   catalytic activities decreased with time on stream. After 15 h, the
   nitrided 2 wt.\% Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalyst was the most active among the
   tested catalysts. The results of H-2-TPR measurements for the used and
   oxygen-saturated catalysts revealed that catalyst deactivation was a
   result of oxygen incorporation into the nitride lattices. The strong
   interaction between the molybdenum species and H-ZSM-5 zeolite as well
   as the lowering of H-2-reduction temperature of surface oxygen might be
   the reasons for the good performance of the nitrided 2 wt.\% Mo/H-ZSM-5

Title = {{Comparison of the Canadian CT Head Rule and the New Orleans Criteria in

Abstract = {{Context Current use of cranial computed tomography (CT) for minor head
   injury is increasing rapidly, highly variable, and inefficient. The
   Canadian CT Head Rule (CCHR) and New Orleans Criteria (NOC) are
   previously developed clinical decision rules to guide CT use for
   patients with minor head injury and with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores
   of 13 to 15 for the CCHR and a score of 15 for the NOC. However,
   uncertainty about the clinical performance of these rules exists.
   Objective To compare the clinical performance of these 2 decision rules
   for detecting the need for neurosurgical intervention and clinically
   important brain injury.
   Design, Setting, and Patients In a prospective cohort study (June
   2000-December 2002) that included 9 emergency departments in large
   Canadian community and university hospitals, the CCHR was evaluated in a
   convenience sample of 2707 adults who presented to the emergency
   department with blunt head trauma resulting in witnessed loss of
   consciousness, disorientation, or definite amnesia and a GCS score of 13
   to 15. The CCHR and NOC were compared in a subgroup of 1822 adults with
   minor head injury and GCS score of 15. 1
   Main Outcome Measures Neurosurgical intervention and clinically
   important brain injury evaluated by CT and a structured follow-up
   telephone interview.
   Results Among 1822 patients with GCS score of 15, 8 (0.4\%) required
   neurosurgical intervention and 97 (5.3\%) had clinically important brain
   injury. The NOC and the CCHR both had 100\% sensitivity but the CCHR was
   more specific (76.3\% vs 12.1 \%, P<001) for predicting need for
   neurosurgical intervention. For clinically important brain injury, the
   CCHR and the NOC had similar sensitivity (100\% vs 100\%; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 96\%-100\%) but the CCHR was more specific
   (50.6\% vs 12.7\%, P<001), and would result in lower CT rates (52.1 \%
   vs 88.0\%, P<.001). The K values for physician interpretation of the
   rules, CCHR vs NOC, were 0.85 vs 0.47, Physicians misinterpreted the
   rules as not requiring imaging for 4.0\% of patients according to CCHR
   and 5.5\% according to NOC (P =.04). Among all 2707 patients with a GCS
   score of 13 to 15, the CCHR had sensitivities of 100\% (95\% Cl, 91
   \%-100\%) for 41 patients requiring neurosurgical intervention and 100\%
   (95\% Cl, 98\%-100\%) for 231 patients with clinically important brain
   injury.
   Conclusion For patients with minor head injury and GCS score of 15, the
   CCHR and the NOC have equivalent high sensitivities for need for
   neurosurgical intervention and clinically important brain injury, but
   the CCHR has higher specificity for important clinical outcomes than
   does the NOC, and its use may result in reduced imaging rates.}},

Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the last decade many studies have definitely shown that
   human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the major cause of cervical
   carcinogenesis and, in the last few years, HPV testing has been proposed
   as a new and more powerful tool for cervical cancer screening. This
   issue is now receiving considerable attention in scientific and non
   scientific press and HPV testing could be considered the most important
   change in this field since the introduction of cervical cytology. This
   paper reports our prevalence data of HPV infection collected in the
   `90s, while a follow up of these patients is ongoing.
   Methods: For this study we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
   search HPV DNA sequences in cervical cell scrapings obtained from 503
   asymptomatic women attending regular cervical cancer screening program
   in the city of Genova, Italy. All patients were also submitted to a
   self-administered, standardized, questionnaire regarding their life
   style and sexual activity. On the basis of the presence of HPV DNA
   sequences women were separated into two groups: ``infected{''} and ``non
   infected{''} and a statistical analysis of the factors potentially
   associated with the infection group membership was carried out.
   Results: The infection rate was 15.9\% and the most frequent viral type
   was HPV 16.
   Conclusion: Our HPV positivity rate (15.9\%) was consistent to that
   reported by other studies on European populations.}},

Abstract = {{Aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of physical
   stressors (electric foot-shocks) on effect of the antidepressant drug,
   clomipramine and plasma corticosterone levels in male and female rats
   tested in a model of behavioral despair (forced swim test,). Male and
   female rats of the Wistar strain were injected with clornipramine (50
   mg/kg, i.p.) or saline. A group of animals also received electric shocks
   of different intensity and duration of 24, 5 and I It before being
   subjected to forced swim test. At the end of behavioral procedures,
   vaginal smears were assessed in all female animals and data on
   immobility time were plotted according to the ovarian cycle phase. After
   decapitation, corticosterone plasma levels were measured by
   radioimmunoassay in both male and female rats. Application of mild
   shocks (5 ms, 0.1 mA) significantly reduced immobility time in forced
   swim test of untreated male rats and augmented clomipramine effect on
   this parameter. Moderate shocks of higher intensity or duration (5 ms,
   1.0 mA) also resulted in decreased immobility time of untreated male
   rats, but in reduced effect of clornipramine treatment. Furthermore,
   application of severe shocks (10 ms, 1.0 mA) increased the immobility
   time in untreated animals and totally abolished clomipramine effect in
   forced swim test. Untreated non-shocked female rats in proestrous and
   estrous phases exhibited a longer immobility time as compared to
   diestrous animals. Immobility time appeared to be generally higher when
   mild, moderate or severe shocks were applied prior to behavioral testing
   in proestrous and estrous animals, while the behavioral response of
   diestrous and metestrous animals did not differ from that of controls.
   Clomipramine effect on immobility time was generally reduced by
   application of shocks of every strengths. Stress-induced plasma
   corticosterone levels surge correlated with intensity and duration of
   shocks in both male and female rats, but clornipramine treatment
   generally blunted the hormonal response. However, severe shocks were
   followed by a surge of plasma corticosterone levels in both male and
   female clomipramine-treated rats.
   These results demonstrate that duration and intensity of stressful
   stimuli may deeply affect the behavioral response of rats in forced swim
   test and influence clomipramine effect in this behavioral model
   depending on gender-based variables, probably of the hormonal type.
   Plasma corticosterone levels correlate with the behavioral response to
   clomipramine treatment suggesting that reactivity of
   hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis to stress may be involved in the
   antidepressant effect of this drug. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {{The control of unspecific adsorption of proteins to natural and
   technical surfaces plays an important role in biology and also for many
   applications. Organic model surfaces, e.g., self-assembled monolayers,
   are often used to identify fundamental surface and/or protein properties
   that rule protein adsorption. Some techniques involved in biointerface
   research require the use of heavy water, e.g. neutron scattering
   techniques. Also in NMR studies D2O is the solvent of choice when
   focusing on biomolecular and hydration dynamics. So far several studies
   have been concerned with the characterization of the unspecific
   adsorption of proteins from normal water buffers. In the present work,
   we report a comparison of the unspecific protein adsorption from normal
   and heavy water buffers. So far it has been assumed that the surface
   kinetic of the unspecific adsorption is unaffected by the substitution
   of water by D2O. However, for the four proteins investigated here, this
   assumption does not hold. The ratio kH/kD of the adsorption rate
   constants of the different buffer conditions describe the strength of
   the isotope effect. We have measured ratios between 1.0 and 2.6,
   indicating that the adsorption kinetics are strongly affected by a
   H2O-D2O substitution.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the modulation of angiotensin II-induced
   endothelial prostanoid release in rabbit aortic rings. Two cumulative
   dose response curves with 90-min washing interval were performed.
   Incubation with (L)-N-G-nitroarginine methyl ester ((L)-NAME) 10(-4) M
   increased angiotensin II maximal contractile response (E-max). This
   effect was reversed by indomethacin 10(-5) M, diphenyliodinum 10(-5) M,
   Tempol 10(-5) M or ascorbic acid 10(-4) M in both cumulative dose
   response curves and by SQ 29548 10(-6) M in the second cumulative dose
   response curve. When segments were treated with tetraethylamonium 10(-3)
   M but not with glibenclamide 10(-5) M during the washing period, L-NAME
   recovered its ability to enhance the E-max in arteries incubated with SQ
   29548. Conclusions: nitric oxide modulates angiotensin II-induced
   endothelial release of cyclooxygenase-dependent eicosanoids, one of
   which acts through thromboxane A(2)/prostaglandin H-2 receptors and
   would decrease K-Ca channel activity. An increase in free radical
   production may account for the enhancement of such prostanoid release.
   Furthermore, it was found that in the present conditions, the release of
   the hyperpolarizing factor would improve in order to maintain the
   vascular tone. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Diminished Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is an
   important contributor to the impaired contractility of the failing
   heart. Despite extensive effort, the underlying causes of abnormal SR Ca
   release in heart failure (HF) remain unknown. We used a combination of
   simultaneous imaging of cytosolic and SR intraluminal {[}Ca] in isolated
   cardiomyocytes and recordings from single-ryanodine receptor (RyR)
   channels reconstituted into lipid bilayers to investigate alterations in
   intracellular Ca handling in an experimental model of chronic HF. We
   found that diastolic free {[}Ca] inside the SIR was dramatically reduced
   because of a Ca leak across the SIR membrane, mediated by spontaneous
   local release events (Ca sparks), in HF myocytes. Additionally, the
   magnitudes of intrastore Ca depletion signals during global and focal Ca
   release events were blunted, and {[}Ca](SR) recovery was slowed after
   global but not focal Ca release in HF myocytes. At the single-RyR level,
   the sensitivity of RyRs to activation by luminal Ca was greatly
   enhanced, providing a molecular mechanism for the maintained
   potentiation of Ca sparks (and increased Ca leak) at reduced intra-SR
   {[}Ca] in HF. This work shows that the diminished SR Ca release
   characteristic of failing myocardium could be explained by increased
   sensitivity of RyRs to luminal Ca, leading to enhanced spark-mediated SR
   Ca leak and reduced intra-SR {[}Ca].}},

Abstract = {{Background - Cardiotropic viral infections have been suspected as one
   possible cause of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Although
   adverse outcomes in dilated cardiomyopathy patients have been
   documented, the natural course of heart diseases caused by cardiotropic
   viruses is unknown.
   Methods and Results - Consecutive patients (n = 172) with biopsy-proven
   viral infection in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) were followed up by
   reanalysis of EMBs and hemodynamic measurements after a median period of
   6.8 months (range, 5.4 to 11.9). Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   and reverse transcription - PCR were performed to analyze the genomic
   sequences. Myocardial inflammation was assessed by histology and
   immunohistology. At baseline, 32.6\% of EMBs in the study group
   contained enteroviral (EV) RNA, 8.1\% adenovirus (ADV) DNA, 36.6\%
   parvovirus B19 (PVB19) DNA, and 10.5\% human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV6)
   DNA. In 12.2\% of the samples, dual infection with PVB19 and HHV6 was
   present. Follow-up analysis of EMBs by PCR documented spontaneous
   clearance of viral genomes in 36.2\% (55/151) of all patients with
   single infections. Virus-specific clearance rates were 50\% for EV,
   35.7\% for ADV, 22.2\% for PVB19, and 44.4\% for HHV6. In patients with
   dual infection with PVB19(+) and HHV6(+)-, HHV6 was cleared in 42.8\%
   (9/21), whereas PVB19 persisted in all 21 patients. Clearance of viral
   genomes was associated with a significant improvement in left
   ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), improving from 50.2 +/- 19.1\% to
   58.1 +/- 15.9\% (P < 0.001). In contrast, LV function decreased in
   patients with persisting viral genomes ( LVEF, 54.3 +/- 16.1\% versus
   51.4 +/- 16.1\%, P < 0.01).
   Conclusions - In this first biopsy-based analysis of the course of viral
   heart disease, we show that EV, ADV, PVB19, and HHV6 persistence
   detected in the myocardium of patients with LV dysfunction was
   associated with a progressive impairment of LVEF, whereas spontaneous
   viral elimination was associated with a significant improvement in LV
   function.}},

Abstract = {{The novel antiepileptic drug levetiracetam
   ((2S-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)butanamide, KEPPRA (R)) possesses a specific
   binding site in brain, which has very recently been identified as the
   synaptic vesicle protein SV2A. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   presence of a levetiracetam binding site in the spinal cord and compare
   its properties to that in rat brain. We used {[}H-3]ucb 30889
   ((2S)-2-{[}4-(3-azidophenyl)-2-oxopyrroli din-1-yl]butanamide), a
   levetiracetam analogue, to perform binding assays, photoaffinity
   labelling and autoradiography experiments, and revealed the presence of
   SV2A by Western-blot analysis. {[}H-3]ucb 30889 binding kinetics at 4
   degrees C were biphasic and saturation binding curves were compatible
   with the labelling of a homogenous population of binding sites with a
   K-d similar to that in brain. Competition curves with ligands known to
   interact with levetiracetam binding sites and photolabelling experiments
   indicated that {[}H-3]ucb 30889 labels the same 90 kDa protein in both
   spinal cord and brain. Levetiracetam binding site was localised in the
   grey matter of the spinal cord and its expression was not modified in a
   model of neuropathic pain. This study demonstrates the presence of a
   specific levetiracetam binding site in the rat spinal cord, which is
   similar to that found in rat brain. (0 2005 Elsevier BX All rights

Abstract = {{The structure of a planar supported lipid bilayer (PSLB) prepared by the
   Langmuir-Blodgett (LB)/Langmuir-Schaefer (LS) method was investigated by
   sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy (SFVS). By using asymmetric lipid
   bilayers composed of selectively deuterated
   1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) lipids, the
   orientation of the fatty acid chains and phosphocholine headgroups has
   been determined independently for both leaflets of the bilayer. The
   alkyl chains of the lipids were found to be orientated approximately 13
   degrees +/- 4 degrees from the surface normal for both leaflets. The
   lipid chains in both leaflets also contain some gauche content, which is
   consistent with previous NMR and FTIR studies of similar lipid systems.
   More importantly, the relative number of gauche defects does not seem to
   be influenced by the deposition method, LB versus LS. The headgroup
   orientation for the lipid film in contact with the silica support was
   determined to be 69 degrees +/- 3 degrees, whereas that in contact with
   the aqueous phase was 66 degrees +/- 4 degrees from the surface normal.
   The SFVS results indicate that the structure of the DSPC lipid film in
   contact with the solid support and the film adjacent to the aqueous
   phase are nearly identical in structure. These results suggesting the
   LB/LS deposition method do indeed produce symmetric lipid bilayers.
   These studies further add to the growing information on the efficacy of
   PSLBs as suitable models for biological membrane studies.}},

Abstract = {{Current methodologies for the production of meso- and nanoporous

   application of ring closing metathesis depolymerization to surfactant
   degradation resulting in the mild, facile decomposition of these new

Abstract = {{Liver transplantation (LT) has become an accepted treatment for various
   hepatic-based metabolic disorders. For diseases with hepatic origin but
   mainly extrahepatic manifestations, it can be regarded as a means of
   gene therapy. Depending on the underlying disease, optimal dietary and
   medicamentous treatment cannot reliably prevent periods of metabolic
   decompensation resulting in severe organ damage. In severe neonatal
   forms of urea cycle disorders, liver transplantation should be
   considered in early infancy. The same applies to propionic acidemia,
   although severe perioperative complications have been described. In
   methylmalonic aciduria, there is no consensus whether LT alone is prior
   to combined liver and kidney transplantation (LKT). Moreover, late
   neurologic complications can occur in some patients with propionic and
   methylmalonic acidemias. LT as well as LKT is discussed in primary
   hyperoxaluria. For patients with cystic fibrosis and biliary cirrhosis,
   LT has become an established treatment that may even improve pulmonary
   function. Careful individual decisions must be made in patients with
   mitochondrial disorders because of possible progressive neuromuscular
   involvement. In most hepatic-based metabolic disorders, restoration of
   only about 10\% of the original enzyme activity is sufficient to warrant
   sufficient metabolic control.}},

Volume = {{44}},

Pages = {{12709-12718}},

Abstract = {{We describe herein the characterization of the equilibrium point for A
   beta(1-40) amyloid fibril elongation in phosphate-buffered saline at 37
   degrees C. Seeded fibril elongation progresses rapidly to a reproducible
   end point of 0.7-1.0 mu M unpolymerized monomeric peptide. This
   remaining monomeric material is functional, since after concentration it
   supports fibril elongation. Incubation of fibrils in the same buffer
   results in dissociation to a final monomer concentration in the same
   range. This robust G value is equivalent to the A beta(1-40) fibril
   dissociation constant, K-d. The fact that a similar value for K-d is
   obtained from a ratio of dissociation and elongation rate constants
   further supports the view that these values are associated with a
   position of dynamic equilibrium and therefore are related to free
   energies of amyloid fibril elongation. The C-r value reported here for
   wild-type A beta(1-40) fibrils corresponds to a free energy of fibril
   elongation of about -9 kcal/mol, a value similar to free energies of
   folding for small globular proteins. Elongation and dissociation of
   amyloid fibrils from point mutants of A beta(1-40) also yield Cr values,
   different for different mutants, that reflect stabilizing/destabilizing
   effects. Interestingly, assembly of A beta(1 -40) fibrils in the
   presence of a saturating concentration of the amyloid dye thioflavin T
   does not measurably affect fibril stability, in contrast to the commonly
   observed stabilization of globular proteins by ligand binding. The
   ability to quantify and compare amyloid fibril thermodynamic stabilities
   makes it possible to include fibrils, and potentially other aggregates,
   in quantitative descriptions of protein folding landscapes.}},

   p21(WAF1/CIP1) through activation of Sp1/Sp3. In the present study, we
   found that high Ca2+ activated NFAT1 through calcineurin-dependent
   dephosphorylation. In growing NHK cells, Krueppel-like factor (KLF)16, a
   member of the Sp/KLF family, bound to the p21(WAF1/CIP1) promoter and,
   thereby, inhibited the transcription of p21(WAF1/CIP1). Sp1 complexed
   with NFAT1 in high Ca2+ -treated cells or with Smad3 in TGF beta
   1-treated cells, but not Sp1 alone, replaced KLF16 from the
   p21(WAF1/CIP1) promoter and transcriptionally activated the
   p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene. Thus, high Ca2+ and TGF beta 1 have a common
   S1OOC/A11-mediated pathway in addition to a unique pathway
   (NFAT1-mediated pathway for high Ca2+ and Smad-mediated pathway for TGF

Abstract = {{A consequent application of the Milan criteria in patients undergoing
   liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may lead to
   excellent long-term survival and a low incidence of recurrence.
   Expanding the selection criteria will result in more patients with
   hepatocellular carcinoma being potentially curative treated, but this
   approach is associated with at least a higher incidence of recurrence.
   Kaplan-Meier analysis of 110 patients, who underwent liver
   transplantation for HCC in our institution between 1987 and 2004, showed
   a significant improvement in patient survival with time. A change in
   criteria for patient selection may have contributed to the improved
   outcome. In 28 of 110 patients a recurrence of HCC was observed. In 82\%
   of patients, who developed recurrence of carcinoma, the Milan criteria
   were not met. Dropout from the waiting list is common and several
   methods, including percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency
   ablation, and chemoembolization, are used to prevent tumor progression
   and thus prevent dropout. As no randomized trials are available some
   uncertainty remains, whether these neoadjuvant procedures improve
   outcome. At present, there is no evidence that this approach enables
   expansion of the selection criteria. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a major
   indication for living related liver transplantation because the risk of
   dropout while waiting is negligible. Extension of the Milan criteria in
   the setting of living related liver transplantation may offer more
   patients a potentially curative treatment, without reducing the donor
   pool of organs for other patients on the waiting list with nonmalignant
   liver disease.}},

   Results. Of 23 patients with impaired fasting glucose levels of 111-126
   mg/dl, 14 (61\%) met ADA criteria for diabetes mellitus of based on home
   glucometer monitoring. The incidence of de novo PTDM was 31\% during
   this period. Predictors of PTDM in a Cox proportional hazards model were
   race and acute rejection, with a trend towards BMI. Clinic visit FPG
   levels did not differ between PTDM and non-PTDM patients. All diagnoses
   were made based on prelunch or supper FPG >200 mg/dl
   Conclusions. Overnight FPG are inadequate for diagnosis of PTDM. All
   renal transplant recipients with impaired FPG should, at minimum, have
   home FPG testing.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemistry and electrocatalysis of a number of heme proteins
   entrapped in agarose hydrogel films in the room-temperature ionic liquid
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ({[}bmim]-{[}PF6]) have
   been investigated. UV-vis and FTIR spectroscopy show that the heme
   proteins retain their native structure in agarose film. The uniform
   distribution of hemoglobin in agarose-dimethylformamide film was
   demonstrated by atomic force microscopy. Cyclic voltammetry shows that
   direct electron transfer between the heme proteins and glassy carbon
   electrode is quasi-reversible in {[}bmim]{[}PF6]. The redox potentials
   for hemoglobin, myoglobin, horseradish peroxidase, cytochrome c, and
   catalase were found to be more negative than those in aqueous solution.
   The charge-transfer coefficient and the apparent electron-transfer rate
   constant for these heme proteins in {[}bmim] {[}PF6] were calculated
   from the peak-to-peak separation as a function of scan rate. The heme
   proteins catalyze the electroreduction of trichloroacetic acid and
   tert-butyl hydroperoxide in {[}bmim] {[}PF6]. The kinetic parameter
   I-max (maximum current at saturation concentration of substrate) and the
   apparent K-m (Michaelis -Menten constant) for the electrocatalytic

Volume = {{539}},
Pages = {{57-91}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{The paper considers the evolution of weakly nonlinear disturbances in
   linearly unstable stratified shear flows. We develop a generic
   Hamiltonian formulation for two-dimensional flows. The paper is focused
   on three-wave resonant interactions, which are always present in the
   stratified shear flows under consideration as the lowest-order nonlinear
   process. Two different types of shear flows are considered. The first
   one is the classical piecewise-linear model with constant density and
   vorticity in each layer. For such flows, linear instability is due to
   weak interaction of different modes. The second type is the
   Kelvin-Helmholtz model, consisting of two layers with different
   densities and velocities. Velocity shear is assumed to be weakly
   supercritical. We show that apart from the classical triplets consisting
   of stable waves, both flow types admit only triplets consisting of one
   weakly unstable and two neutrally stable waves, and we consider them in
   detail.
   Universal evolution equations for three resonantly interacting wave
   packets are derived for both cases. For the first flow type, the generic
   equations coincide with the system derived earlier for a particular case
   of resonant interactions between unstable and neutral baroclinic waves
   in a quasi-geostrophic two-layer model. The evolution equations for the
   Kelvin-Helmholtz model are new, and are studied numerically and
   analytically in detail. In particular, we demonstrate that resonant
   interaction with neutral waves can stabilize the growth of the linearly
   unstable wave. This mechanism is essentially different from the
   well-known nonlinear stabilization mechanism due to cubic nonlinearity.}},

Abstract = {{Auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development by altering
   the expression of diverse genes. Among these, the early auxin-responsive
   genes of Aux/IAA class have been extensively studied in dicots but
   little information is available on monocots. Earlier, we reported the
   isolation of OsiIAA1 cDNA, first monocot member of Aux/IAA gene family
   from rice. Extending this work further, we have isolated the OsiIAA1
   gene from rice localized on chromosome 3. The transcriptional start site
   was mapped to 158 bp upstream to the translational start site. The
   increased accumulation of OsiIAA1 transcript in auxin-treated rice
   coleoptiles even in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor,
   cycloheximide, suggested that OsiIAA1 is a primary auxin response gene;
   the expression of OsiIAA1 gene was also upregulated in the presence of
   cycloheximide alone. The OsiIAA1 transcript levels were down-regulated
   in etiolated rice coleoptiles irradiated with far-red, red and blue
   light, suggesting the existence of a cross-talk between auxin and light
   signaling. The antibodies raised against His(6)-OsiIAA1 recombinant
   protein could detect the OsiIAA1 protein in the plant extract only in
   the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, indicating that OsiIAA1
   is rapidly degraded by proteasome complex. The degradation of the
   protein was enhanced by the application of exogenous auxin. Also, the
   proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilized the purified His(6)-OsiIAA1
   protein to some extent in the cell-free extracts of rice coleoptiles.
   The OsiIAA1 protein harbors two nuclear localization signals (NLSs), one
   bipartite and the other resembling SV40 type NLS. Although both the NLSs
   were able to target the protein to the nucleus, the bipartite NLS was
   more effective. These studies indicate that nuclear localization of
   OsiIAA1 could be a prerequisite for its role in auxin signal
   transduction. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{The horizontal components of broadband seismographs are highly sensitive
   to tilt, suggesting that commonly deployed portable broadband seismic
   sensors may record important tilt information associated with volcanic
   eruptions. We report on a tilt episode that coincides with the first
   historical eruption of Anatahan volcano on May 10, 2003. The tilt was
   recorded by a Strekheisen STS-2 seismograph deployed in an underground
   insulated chamber 7 km west of the active vent. An ultra-long period
   signal with a dominant period of several hours was recorded on the E-W
   component beginning at 06:20 GMT on May 10, which coincides with the
   onset of continuous volcano-tectonic (VT) seismicity and is one hour
   prior to the eruption time estimated by the Volcanic Ash Advisory
   Center. The signal is much smaller on the N-S component and absent on
   the vertical component, suggesting it results from tilt that is
   approximately radial with respect to the active vent. An estimate of
   tilt as a function of time is recovered by deconvolving the record to
   acceleration and dividing by the acceleration of gravity. The record
   indicates an initial episode of tilt downward away from the volcanic
   center from 06:20-09:30 GMT, which we interpret as inflation of the
   shallow volcanic source. The tilt reverses, recording deflation, from
   09:30 until 17:50, after which the tilt signal becomes insignificant.
   The inflation corresponds to a period of numerous VT events, whereas
   fewer events were recorded during the deflation episode, and the VT
   events subsequently resumed after the end of the deflationary tilt. The
   maximum tilt of 2 microradians can be used to estimate the volume of the
   source inflation (similar to 2 million m 3), assuming a simple Mogi
   source model. These calculations are consistent with other estimates of
   source volume if reasonable source depths are assumed. Examination of
   broadband records of other eruptions may disclose further previously
   unrecognized tilt signals.}},

   for both linear and cyclic chains. Thus, we conclude that the Peierls
   transition occurs at lambda = 0 in these models. Moreover, for the XY

   order follow the classical prediction as a function of inverse chain
   size for small lambda. We therefore conclude that the zero lambda phase

Year = {{2005}},

Abstract = {{On 20 March 2003, a forward shock was observed in the near-Earth solar
   wind, followed 8 hours later by an interplanetary magnetic cloud (IMC),
   in a configuration having several uncommon features: Both were parts of
   a 38-hour interval containing transient solar outflows that occurred in
   an extended high-speed stream from a Y-shaped extension of the south
   polar coronal hole. (In contrast, IMCs, and ejecta in general, were
   rarely observed within high-speed streams at low heliolatitudes during
   cycle 23.) The most likely solar source for the IMC is AR 10314, located
   at S15 degrees, just above the ``fork{''} of the Y-shaped coronal hole.
   Several solar flares occurred in this active region on 17-18 March, as
   well as a succession of four coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Velocity
   considerations narrow the most likely source of the 38-hour interval of
   activity to two CMEs on 17 March 2003 associated with solar flares at
   W33 degrees and W39 degrees. The IMC axis had a north-south orientation,
   which is unusual for IMCs during this solar cycle. Its left-handedness
   implies an association with a left-skewed coronal arcade, which is less
   common in the Southern Hemisphere. Considering the shock observed ahead
   of the IMC, we conclude based on orientation and ram pressure arguments
   that this shock was not driven by the IMC, as might be presumed, but was
   the flank of an unrelated shock that overtook the IMC approximately
   halfway between Sun and Earth, heating the plasma and accelerating
   particles within the IMC. The CME associated with the X-class flare, at
   1208 UT on 18 March in AR 10314 appears to be the solar source for this
   shock.}},

Abstract = {{Ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs) are emerging materials used to
   realize motion sensors and actuators. In the former case by bending an
   IPMC membrane a voltage output is obtained, while in the latter case a
   voltage input is able to cause the membrane to bend.
   Although a number of interesting properties have been described for such
   materials, few results have been obtained regarding their
   characterization.
   In this paper a system devoted to the characterization of IPMCs as
   motion sensors is presented. The system was built in order to study the
   IPMC reaction, in a large range of frequencies, to a mechanical bending

   An IPMC strip acts as the movable capacitive plate between two fixed
   plates, inside a differential capacitive measuring system. The motion of
   the IPMC is transduced into the system output voltage, without any
   mechanical contact, while ad-hoc electronics detect the IPMC sensing
   output voltage.
   A description of the IPMC characterization system follows a brief
   introduction to IPMC behaviour as sensors and actuators. Then, steps
   devoted to evaluation of the relationship between the input displacement
   forced to the IPMC being tested and the corresponding IPMC voltage
   output are derived. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to improve the functionality of a prosthetic hand device,
   a new fingertip has been developed that incorporates sensors to measure
   temperature and grip force and to detect the onset of object slip from
   the hand. The sensors have been implemented using thick-film printing
   technology and exploit the piezoresistive characteristics of
   commercially available screen printing resistor pastes and the
   piezoelectric properties of proprietary lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT)
   formulated pastes. The force sensor exhibits a highly linear response to
   forces up to 50 N with a maximum hysteresis of less than 1.4\% of full
   scale. When configured as a pseudo half-bridge measurement circuit, the
   force sensor demonstrates superior insensitivity to the position of the
   force on the fingertip than when configured as a classic half-bridge
   circuit. The force sensor response is also extremely stable with
   temperature, typically showing variation in the output response of less
   than 0.04\% over the temperature range - 10 degrees C to +35 degrees C
   when loaded with forces up to 10.8 N. The ability of the piezoelectric
   PZT vibration sensor to detect small vibrations of the cantilever,
   indicative of object slip, has also been demonstrated. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In order to improve the power density of microactuators, recent research
   focuses on the applicability of fluidic power at microscale. The main
   encountered difficulties in the development of small fluidic actuators
   are related to production tolerances and assembly requirements.
   Furthermore, these actuators tend to comprise highly three-dimensional
   parts, which are incompatible with traditional microproduction
   technologies. This paper presents accurate production and novel assembly
   techniques for the development of a hydraulic microactuator. In
   addition, a scalable low friction seal, relying on surface tension
   forces, is presented. A prototype piston-type microactuator with a bore
   of I mm and a length of 13 mm is developed. Using a gallium-based
   surface tension seal, pressures of more than 90 kpa have been sealed

Abstract = {{The 3D-structure of the maltooligosaccharide-specific LamB-channel
   Escherichia coli (also called maltoporin) is known from X-ray
   crystallography. The 3D structure suggests that a number of aromatic
   residues (Y6, Y41, W74, F229, W358 and W420) within the channel lumen
   are involved carbohydrate and ion transport. All aromatic residues were
   replaced alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Furthermore, LamB mutants were
   created in which two, three, four, five and all six aromatic residues
   were replaced study their effects on ion and maltopentaose transport
   through LamB. The purified mutant proteins were reconstituted into lipid
   bilayer membranes and the single-channel conductance of the mutants was
   studied conductance experiments. The results suggest that all aromatic
   residues provide some steric hindrance for ion transport through LamB.
   impact is provided by Y6 and Y41 that are localized opposite Y118, which
   form the central constriction of the LamB channel. Stability constants
   for binding of maltopentaose to the mutant channels were measured using
   titration experiments with the carbohydrate. The mutation of one or
   several aromatic residue(s) led to a substantial decrease of the
   stability constant binding. The highest effect was observed when all
   aromatic residues were replaced by alanine because no binding of
   maltopentaose could be detected in such a case. However, binding was
   again possible when Y118 was replaced by tryptophan. The
   carbohydrate-induced block of the channel function could be used also
   for the study of current noise through the different mutant
   LamB-channels. The analysis of the power density spectra of some of the
   mutants allowed the evaluation of the on-rate and off-rate constants
   (k(1) and k (-1)) of carbohydrate binding to the binding site inside the
   channels. The results suggest that both on-rate and off-rate constants
   were affected by the mutations. For most mutants, k(1) decreased and
   k(-1) increased. The possible influence of the aromatic residues of the
   greasy slide on carbohydrate and ion transport through LamB is
   discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary zinc deficiency is common in developing Lis well as developed
   countries. Endothelial cells (EC) lining the inner surface of peripheral
   blood vessels are sensitive to zinc deficiency and lose structural
   integrity when exposed to culture media low in zinc or to zinc
   chelators. In contrast, we demonstrate here that human brain
   microvascular EC (HBMEC), which constitute the blood-brain barrier
   (BBB), resist zinc depletion and respond by enhancing their barrier
   function. This response was specific for HBMEC and did not occur in
   non-brain EC, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human
   aortic endothelial cells, and human iliac vein endothelial cells. Our
   results suggest the presence of specific mechanisms to counteract zinc
   deficiency at the BBB, likely involving HBMEC junctional complexes.
   Understanding the mechanisms involved in this unique response might
   provide means to modulate the BBB dysfunction associated with
   neurological disorders such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and
   Alzheimer's disease. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Much of what we think we know about crystallization in polymers is
   obtained from studies carried out under isothermal conditions. From
   extrapolations of equilibrium melting temperature to crystallization
   regimes, interpretations in the literature all assume that the measured
   temperature of a polymer film is the temperature at which the
   crystallization occurred.
   Recently it has been possible to study crystallization at very high
   supercoolings, even in rapidly crystallizing polymers, through the use
   of a rapid cooling technique in which a thin film contains a
   microthermocouple to measure actual temperature. In adequately thin
   films an isothermal temperature is set up through a balance between the
   heat of fusion released and the cooling rate applied. This technique has
   been applied successfully to polypropylenes, and to polyethylene
   homopolymers and copolymers. The results have told us much about
   crystallization at very high supercoolings. Recently, a study of the
   effect of nucleating agents on quench-crystallization in PET and in
   nylon 6 was conducted, in which it was discovered that films containing
   nucleating agents generated the expected temperature plateau when
   crystallization occurred.
   In this paper, we wish to report the results of studies of thin films of
   nylon 66 and PET which did not contain nucleating agents. The results
   are totally unexpected and indicate that a steady state condition exists
   at the growth face of the polymer, which is not reflected in the
   macroscopic temperature of the thin film, as measured using a
   microthermocouple. In other words the measured temperature of a film is
   not the temperature at which crystallization occurs. The consequences of
   this finding to our general understanding of crystallization in polymers
   will be discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have measured P- and S-wave velocities on two amphibolite and two
   gneiss samples from the Kola superdeep borehole as a function of
   pressure (up to 600 MPa) and temperature (up to 600 degrees C). The
   velocity measurements include compressional (Vp) and shear wave
   velocities (Vs1, Vs2) propagating in three orthogonal directions which
   were in general not parallel to inherent rock symmetry axes or planes.
   The measurements are accompanied by 3D-velocities calculations based on
   lattice preferred orientation (LPO) obtained by TOF (Time Of Flight)
   neutron diffraction analysis which allows the investigation of bulk
   volumes up to several cubic centimetres due to the high penetration
   depth of neutrons. The LPO-based numerical velocity calculations give
   important information on the different contribution of the various
   rock-forming minerals to bulk elastic anisotropy and on the relations of
   seismic anisotropy, shear wave splitting, and shear wave polarization to
   the structural reference frame (foliation and lineation). Comparison
   with measured velocities obtained for the three propagation directions
   that were not in accordance with the structural frame of the rocks
   (foliation and lineation) demonstrate that for shear waves propagating
   through anisotropic rocks the vibration directions are as important as
   the propagation directions. The study demonstrates that proper
   measurement of shear wave splitting by means of two orthogonal polarized
   sending and receiving shear wave transducers is only possible when their
   propagation and polarization directions are parallel and normal to
   foliation and lineation, respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{PU. 1, a hematopoietic Ets transcription factor, is required for
   development of the lymphoid and myeloid lineages. We have previously
   shown that PU. I functions as both a transcriptional activator and
   repressor through complex formation with CBP/p300 and
   HDAC1/mSin3A/MeCP2, respectively. To determine whether modification of
   PUA is responsible for switching its association between co-activators
   and co-repressors, we examined whether acetylation regulates the
   physical and functional activities of PU.1 PUA was acetylated in vivo
   and its repressor activity was reduced when the putative acetylation
   motifs in the Ets domain were mutated. The mutant cooperated with CBP
   similar to wild type PU. 1, but insufficiently with GATA- 1 and mSin3A.
   Whereas overexpression of wild type PU. 1 induced differentiation block,
   growth inhibition, and apoptotic cell death in MEL erythroleukemia cells
   as we reported previously, overexpression of the mutant-acetylation
   motif PU. 1 did not. Taken together, our data suggest that acetylation
   might regulate the biological functions of PUA in erythroid cells. (c)

Abstract = {{Inonotus obliquus BELYU1102 was selected from 12 different strains of
   Inonotus as a producer of immuno-stimulating polysaccharide. After a
   batch fermentation of L obliquus BELYU1102 was carried out in a 3 00 1
   pilot vessel, endo-polysaccharide and exo-polysaccharide were both
   obtained. The proliferation activity of endo-polysaccharide for splenic
   cells was much higher than the activity of exo-polysaccharide. The
   active endo-polysaccharide was produced primarily during the late
   stationary phase. Enhanced proliferation and polyclonal IgM antibody
   production were observed in B cells by purified water-soluble
   endo-polysaccharide. Nitrite production and expression of IL-1 beta,
   IL-6, TNF-alpha, and iNOS in macrophages were also enhanced. However,
   the endo-polysaccharide did not affect the proliferation of T cells, the
   IL-2 expression of Th1 cells, or the IL-4 expression of Th2 cells. The
   endo-polysaccharide showed activities similar to lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS) for B cells and macrophages, but there was a large difference
   between the two polysaccharides because cellular activations induced by
   endo-polysaccharide were not affected by polymyxin B, a specific
   inhibitor of LPS. The endo-polysaccharide appeared to have other
   cellular binding sites with TLR-4 and did not show a direct toxicity
   against tumor cells. However, indirect anti-cancer effects via
   immuno-stimulation were observed. The mycelial endo-polysaccharide of I.
   obliquus is a candidate for use as an immune response modifier.
   Submerged mycelial cultures are advantageous for industrial production
   of polysaccharides. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A Lagrangian Stochastic Model for the two-particles dispersion, aiming

   Three model versions (1- D, 2-D and 3-D) are tested. Firstly the ability
   of the model to reproduce the two-particle statistics in a homogeneous
   isotropic turbulence is discussed, comparing the model results with
   theoretical predictions in terms of the probability density function
   (PDF) of the particles separation and its statistics. Then, the mean
   concentration and its fluctuations are considered and the results
   presented. The influence of the PDF of the particle separation on the
   concentration fluctuations is shown and discussed. We found that the
   separation PDF in the inertial subrange is not gaussian and this fact
   influences the predicted concentration fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is an eight-subunit
   (Cog1-8) peripheral Golgi protein involved in Golgi-associated membrane
   trafficking and glycoconjugate synthesis. We have analyzed the structure
   and function of COG using Cog1 or Cog2 null Chinese hamster ovary cell
   mutants, fibroblasts from a patient with Cog7-deficient congenital
   disorders of glycosylation, and stable Cog5-deficient HeLa cells
   generated by RNA interference. Although the dilation of some Golgi
   cisternae in Cog5-deficient cells resembled that observed in Cog1- or
   Cog2-deficient cells, their global glycosylation defects (less severe)
   and intracellular processing and function of low density lipoprotein
   receptors (essentially normal) differed from Cog1- and Cog2-deficient
   cells. Immunoblotting, gel filtration, and immunofluorescence microscopy
   analyses of the COG-deficient cells and cell extracts indicated that 1)
   Cog2-4 and Cog5-7 form stable subcomplexes, 2) Cog1 mediates Golgi
   association of a Cog2-4 plus Cog8 subcomplex, 3) Cog8 associates stably
   with both Cog5-7 and Cog1-4 subcomplexes, and thus 4) Cog8 helps
   assemble the Cog1-4 and Cog5-7 subcomplexes into the complete COG
   complex. This model of the subunit organization of COG is in excellent
   agreement with in vitro data presented in an accompanying paper (Ungar,
   D., Oka, T., Vasile, E., Krieger, M., and Hughson, F. M. (2005) J. Biol.
   Chem. 280, 32729-32735). Only one or two of the seven Cog1- or
   Cog2-dependent Golgi membrane proteins called GEARs are also sensitive
   to Cog5 or Cog7 deficiency, indicating that the COG subunits play
   distinctive roles in controlling Golgi structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the piezoelectric actuation of a microbridge based on a
   sputtered aluminium nitride (AIN) thin film. The suspended microbridge
   consists of a silicon nitride structural layer supporting a Mo/AlN/Mo
   actuator. A complete technology for the fabrication of the
   microactuators, fully compatible with standard silicon ICs technologies,
   has been developed. It includes: (1) the selection of the substrate and
   the structural layer, (2) the selection of molybdenum as metal for the
   bottom electrode, (3) the optimization of the sputtering of AIN on
   molybdenum in order to achieve (002) oriented films with good crystal
   quality, low residual stress and good piezoelectric response and (4) the
   fine tuning of the surface micromachining techniques necessary to
   release the whole structure. Preliminary results on the characteristics
   of the microactuators are reported. An actuation voltage of 16 V applied
   to a 350 mu m-long bridge produces a deflection of 3.5 mu m with
   negligible current consumption. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   computational models that assume weak coupling, yet this assumption has

   are in the range of normal synaptic activity for these neurons,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{F4}},
Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{We investigate how a local topographic disturbance of a flat seabed may
   become morphodynamically active, according to the linear instability
   mechanism which gives rise to sandwave formation. The seabed evolution
   follows from a Fourier integral, which can generally not be evaluated in
   closed form. As numerical integration is rather cumbersome and not
   transparent, we propose an analytical way to approximate the solution.
   This method, using properties of the fastest growing mode only, turns
   out to be quick, insightful, and to perform well. It shows how a local
   disturbance develops gradually into a sandwave packet, the area of which
   increases roughly linearly with time. The elevation at the packet's
   center ultimately tends to increase, but this may be preceded by an
   initial stage of decrease, depending on the spatial extent of the
   initial disturbance. In the case of tidal asymmetry, the individual
   sandwaves in the packet migrate at the migration speed of the fastest
   growing mode, whereas the envelope moves at the group speed. Finally, we
   apply the theory to trenches and pits and show where results differ from
   an earlier study in which sandwave dynamics have been ignored.}},

Abstract = {{In the recent past the nonlinear prediction (NLP) method, initially
   developed in the context of nonlinear time series analysis, has been
   successfully applied to river flow deterministic forecasting. In this
   work a probabilistic approach to the NLP method is proposed, which
   allows one to estimate the probability distribution of the predicted
   discharge values and to quantify the total uncertainty related to the
   forecast. An ensemble technique is also proposed in order to optimize
   the choice of the parameter values and to provide robustness to the
   model calibration. The probabilistic NLP method is applied to a river
   flow time series, giving results that confirm the effectiveness and
   reliability of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of current flow through molecular conductors requires
   an interdisciplinary approach to molecular electronics. New reproducible
   experiments with better assembling, including more sophisticated
   fabrication processes and structural control as a feedback for
   assembling of molecular devices, and designing molecular electronic
   devices with pre-defined properties are essential for this goal. Any
   interpretation of molecular transport experimental data requires
   information on the number of molecular wires per device, device
   structure and geometry, and the nature of the molecular-electrode
   bonding. The lack of this knowledge is the pivotal problem in molecular
   electronics. We have thus embarked in developing approaches to fabricate
   molecular electronic devices through self-assembled-monolayer (SAM) of
   molecular wires and insulating molecules in solid-state solutions that
   enable fine structural control, along with development of spectroscopic
   and electrical transport tools to study these structures. We used
   ellipsometry and reflectance spectroscopy to verify that the SAM films
   can be tuned by changing the ratio, r of molecular conductors (wires,
   such as Me-BDT) to insulating molecules (spacers, such as PT). We used
   surface titration for estimating the number of molecular wires per
   device. The single molecule electrical transport process in the vertical
   sandwich configuration SAM diodes with small r-value (r < 10(-3)) that
   is based on isolated molecular wires, reveals a Fowler-Nordheim type
   tunneling injection mechanism. However this behavior is not observed in
   devices fabricated with large r-values.}},

   Even after the PF8 polymer undergoes a thermotropic phase transition to
   a liquid crystal phase these LEDs continue to operate although at
   reduced currents. This behavior is likely caused by changes in the hole
   transport layer and/or polymer interfaces and not by the phase
   transition itself Overall EL output is diminished but PL measurements
   indicate no evidence of PF8 degradation. The step-wise thermal cycling
   of a working device produces a decrease in the relative EL efficiency at
   higher applied bias voltages but results in a pronounced EL efficiency
   increase at voltages near the device turn-on threshold. EL emission and

Abstract = {{The rubber(like)-to-fluid region of the creep compliance J(t) results
   reported by Plazek of two nearly monodisperse polystyrene melts in the
   entanglement region have been quantitatively analyzed in terms of the
   extended reptation theory (ERT), giving the frictional factor K (= zeta
   < b(2)>/kT pi(2)m(2)) in quantitative agreement with the values obtained
   previously from analyzing the relaxation modulus G(t) line shapes as
   well as calculated from the viscosity and diffusion data-a quantity
   shown independent of molecular weight as expected from the theory. Using
   the successful description of J(t) in terms of ERT in the
   rubber(like)-to-fluid region as the reference-frame in time, the
   glassy-relaxation process pG(t) that occurs in the small-compliance
   short-time region of J(t) can be studied in perspective. As shown from
   the analysis in terms of a stretched exponential form for mu(G)(t)
   incorporated into ERT, the temperature dependence of the energetic
   interactions-derived mu(G)(t) process being stronger in a simple manner
   than that of the entropy-derived ERT processes accounts fully for the
   uneven thermorheological complexity occurring in J(t) as initially
   observed by Plazek. When the results of analysis being displayed in the
   G(t) form, the relative roles of the energetic interactions-derived
   dynamic process and the entropy-derived ones in polystyrene are clearly
   revealed. It is shown that at the calorimetric glass transition
   temperature (T-g) the contribution from energetic interactions among
   segments to G(t) at the time scale of the highest Rouse-Mooney normal
   mode greatly exceeds that derived from entropy, indicating vitrification
   at the Rouse-segmental level. At the same time the Rouse-Mooney normal
   modes provide an internal yardstick for estimating the characteristic
   length scale of a polymer at T-g, giving similar to 3 nm for
   polystyrene. On the basis of the obtained results, the basic mechanism
   for the thermorheological complexity occurring in polystyrene is
   analyzed. It is shown that this basic mechanism should be also
   responsible for. the breakdown of the Stoke-Einstein equation in
   relating the translational diffusion constant and viscosity as observed
   in glass-forming liquids, such as OTP and TNB, in approaching T-g from
   above.}},

Title = {{Brownian dynamics simulations of sequence-dependent duplex denaturation
   in dynamically superhelical DNA}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{123}},

Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{The topological state of DNA in vivo is dynamically regulated by a
   number of processes that involve interactions with bound proteins. In
   one such process, the tracking of RNA polymerase along the double helix
   during transcription, restriction of rotational motion of the polymerase
   and associated structures, generates waves of overtwist downstream and
   undertwist upstream from the site of transcription. The resulting
   superhelical stress is often sufficient to drive double-stranded DNA
   into a denatured state at locations such as promoters and origins of
   replication, where sequence-specific duplex opening is a prerequisite
   for biological function. In this way, transcription and other events
   that actively supercoil the DNA provide a mechanism for dynamically
   coupling genetic activity with regulatory and other cellular processes.
   Although computer modeling has provided insight into the equilibrium
   dynamics of DNA supercoiling, to date no model has appeared for
   simulating sequence-dependent DNA strand separation under the
   nonequilibrium conditions imposed by the dynamic introduction of
   torsional stress. Here, we introduce such a model and present results
   from an initial set of computer simulations in which the sequences of
   dynamically superhelical, 147 base pair DNA circles were systematically
   altered in order to probe the accuracy with which the model can predict
   location, extent, and time of stress-induced duplex denaturation. The
   results agree both with well-tested statistical mechanical calculations
   and with available experimental information. Additionally, we find that
   sites susceptible to denaturation show a propensity for localizing to
   supercoil apices, suggesting that base sequence determines locations of
   strand separation not only through the energetics of interstrand
   interactions, but also by influencing the geometry of supercoiling. (c)

Abstract = {{We have deposited diamond-like carbon (DLC) films by reactive

   characterized by visible Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy and scratch test. It has
   been clarified that the fraction of sp(3) bonds in the deposited films,
   as estimated from C1s XPS peaks, increases with an increase in
   hydrogen-gas flow rate. The Raman spectra show the G and D peaks near
   1580 and 1370 cm(-1) respectively, and the intensity of the D peak
   decreases with an increase in hydrogen-gas flow rate, which indicates
   disordering of the amorphous-carbon films. The influence of hydrogen on
   the structural and mechanical properties has been discussed.. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{In sand lizards (Lacerta agilis), males with more and brighter nuptial
   coloration also have more DNA fragments visualized in restriction
   fragment length polymorphism. analysis of their major histocompatibility
   complex class I loci (and, hence, are probably more heterozygous at
   these loci). Such males produce more viable offspring, with a
   particularly strong viability effect on daughters. This suggests that
   females should adjust both their reproductive investment and offspring
   sex ratio in relation to male coloration (i.e. differential allocation).
   Our results show that experimental manipulation of partner coloration in
   the wild results in significantly higher maternal effort and a 10\%
   higher proportion of daughters than sons. This supports the hypothesis
   that females increase their maternal energetic expenditure and adjust
   their offspring sex ratio in response to high-quality partners. However,
   it also suggests that this has probably evolved through natural
   selection for increased offspring viability (primarily through
   production of daughters), rather than through increased mate attraction

Abstract = {{The free energy change associated with the isomerization reaction of
   glycine in water solution has been studied by a hybrid quantum
   mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach combined with the
   theory of energy representation (QM/MM-ER) recently developed. The
   solvation free energies for both neutral and zwitterionic form of
   glycine have been determined by means of the QM/MM-ER simulation. The
   contributions of the electronic polarization and the fluctuation of the
   QM solute to the solvation free energy have been investigated. It has
   been found that the contribution of the density fluctuation of the
   zwitterionic solute is estimated as -4.2 kcal/mol in the total solvation
   free energy of -46.1 kcal/mol, while that of the neutral form is
   computed as -3.0 kcal/mol in the solvation free energy of -15.6
   kcal/mol. The resultant free energy change associated with the
   isomerization of glycine in water has been obtained as -7.8 kcal/mol, in
   excellent agreement with the experimental data of -7.3 or -7.7 kcal/mol,
   implying the accuracy of the QM/MM-ER approach. The results have also

Abstract = {{We present the current status of the TAMA300 data analysis using the
   alternative linear fit (ALF) filter, which is one of the burst filters
   used to extract burst gravitational wave (GW) signals. Although burst GW
   analyses of the TAMA300 data have already made progress using an
   excess-power filter, it is important to use various methods in order to
   avoid missing burst GW signals, because the precise waveforms are
   unknown. In the present work, we set the parameters of the ALF filter
   and then calculated the detection efficiency for GW burst events in our
   galaxy. We obtained a comparable efficiency to that of the excess-power
   filter. In addition, we calculated the trigger rate of the TAMA300 data.
   The result shows that there were so many trigger events which could not
   be identified as being GW signals or fake events that methods to reduce
   fake events are required.}},

Abstract = {{The BL Lacertae object S5 1803+784 has been monitored with very long
   baseline interferometry at lambda = 3.6 cm in 43 epochs between 1986.21
   and 1993.95. The motivation of this work is to obtain statistically
   meaningful data with which to study the short-term structural
   variability in the source on monthly time-scales. We present a detailed
   analysis of the structural evolution seen in the milliarcsecond-scale
   jet by way of model-fitting results. Within the simplest identification
   scenario, the jet can be described as a bent chain of seven jet
   components within 0.2- and 3-mas separation from the core. New
   components seem to emerge almost regularly (every 2 yr) from the core.
   Three jet components approach the brightest and so-called `stationary'
   component (at similar to 1.4 mas at 8.4 GHz) with apparent superluminal
   motion of 8-11 c. In this paper, we show that the `stationary' component
   (under the assumption that this is the brightest jet component in each
   epoch) oscillates, and we discuss several possible explanations. We show
   that a reconfinement shock can easily reproduce the observed most recent
   oscillation of the `stationary' component. We present evidence that the
   average jet ridge line is significantly curved and discuss the
   possibility that the jet components follow a helically bent path.}},

   method) is developed to efficiently solve time-dependent problems using
   FEM techniques. The automatic process is driven by an energy or a
   displacement error indicator which controls the precision of the result.
   The STAR method solves the numerical problem on grids with different
   mesh size. For the Newmark schemes, a general demonstration, using the
   energy method, gives the interface conditions between two successive
   grids which is compatible with the stability of the scheme. Finally,
   using a linear one-dimensional example, the convergence of the method
   and the precision of the results are discussed. Copyright (c) 2005 John

Abstract = {{A chitosanolytic enzyme was purified from a commercial ficin preparation
   by affinity chromatographic removal of cysteine protease on
   pHMB-Sepharose 4B and cystatin-Sepharose 4B and gel filtration on
   Superdex 75 HR. The purified enzyme exhibited both chitinase and
   chitosanase activities, as determined by SDS-PAGE and gel activity
   staining. The optimal pH for chitosan hydrolysis was 4.5, whereas the
   optimal temperature was 65 degrees C. The enzyme was thermostable, as it
   retained almost all of its activity after incubation at 70 degrees C for
   30 min. A protein oxidizing agent, N-bromosuccinimide (0.25 mM),
   significantly inhibited the enzyme's activity. The molecular mass of the
   enzyme was 16.6 kDa, as estimated by gel filtration. The enzyme showed
   activity toward chitosan polymers exhibiting various degrees of
   deacetylation (22-94\%), most effectively hydrolyzing chitosan polymers
   that were 52-70\% deacetylated. The end products of the hydrolysis
   catalyzed by this enzyme were low molecular weight chitosan polymers and
   oligomers (11.2-0.7 kDa).}},

Abstract = {{We study the anisotropy of ESR parameters using single crystal
   TDA-E-C-60, which has two polymorphisms: the one is ferromagnetic
   alpha-phase and the other is non-ferromagnetic alpha'-phase. In both
   alpha'- and alpha- phase, the line-widths and g-factors show anisotropic
   angular dependences at room temperature, such as Delta H-pp(6) > Delta
   H-pp(c) similar to Delta H-pp(a) and g(b) > = g(a). The anisotropic
   behaviour of g-factors in both phases suggest the uniaxial rotation of
   Jahn-Teller distorted C-60 molecules around the c-axis, which is the
   close-packing direction Of C-60 molecules. In the alpha'-phase the
   temperature dependence of g-factors has a clear anomaly around 160K.
   Below this temperature, the observed g-factors are in-between the
   monovalent C-60(-) and TDAE{*}, indicating the restoration of missing
   TDAE spins. In the alpha-phase, the g-factors continuously shift with
   decreasing temperature, become anisotropic below 230K, and show no
   remarkable anomaly at the structural phase transition temperature. These
   results suggest that the difference exists in the mixing between the
   wave functions of C-60 and TDAE, which is possibly developed by the
   structural difference between a'- and a-phases. This difference
   separates the magnetic peculiarities of two polymorphisms in TDAE-C-60.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed laser ablation (PLA) in an inert background gas is a promising
   technique for preparing Si nanoparticles. Although an inert gas is
   appropriate for preparing pure material, a reactive background gas can
   be used to prepare compound nanoparticles. We performed PLA in hydrogen
   gas to prepare hydrogenated silicon nanoparticles. The mean diameter of
   the primary particles measured using transmission electron microscopy
   was approximately 5 nm. The hydrogen content in the deposits was very
   high and estimated to be about 20\%. The infrared absorption
   corresponding to Si-H, (n = 1, 2, 3) bonds on the surface were observed
   at around 2100 cm(-1). The Raman scattering peak corresponding to
   crystalline Si was observed, and that corresponding to amorphous Si was
   negligibly small. These results indicate that the Si nanoparticles were
   not an alloy of Si and hydrogen but Si nanocrystallite (nc-Si) covered
   by hydrogen or hydrogenated amorphous silicon. This means that PLA in
   reactive H-2 gas is a promising technique for preparing surface
   passivated nc-Si. The deposition mechanism and optical properties of the
   surface passivated silicon nanocrystallites are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Context Public and private financial support of biomedical research have
   increased over the past decade. Few comprehensive analyses of the
   sources and uses of funds are available. This results in inadequate
   information on which to base investment decisions because not all
   sources allow equal latitude to explore hypotheses having scientific or
   clinical importance and creates a barrier to judging the value of
   research to society.
   Objective To quantify funding trends from 1994 to 2004 of basic,
   translational, and clinical biomedical research by principal sponsors
   based in the United States.
   Design Publicly available data were compiled for the federal, state, and
   local governments; foundations; charities; universities; and industry.
   Proprietary (by subscription but openly available) databases were used
   to supplement public sources.
   Main Outcome Measures Total actual research spending, growth rates, and
   type of research with inflation adjustment.
   Results Biomedical research funding increased from \$37.1 billion in
   1994 to \$94.3 billion in 2003 and doubled when adjusted for inflation.
   Principal research sponsors in 2003 were industry (57\%) and the
   National Institutes of Health (28\%). Relative proportions from all
   public and private sources did not change. Industry sponsorship of
   clinical trials increased from \$4.0 to \$14.2 billion (in real terms)
   while federal proportions devoted to basic and applied research were
   unchanged. The United States spent an estimated 5.6\% of its total
   health expenditures on biomedical research, more than any other country,
   but less than 0.1\% for health services research. From an economic
   perspective, biotechnology and medical device companies were most
   productive, as measured by new diagnostic and therapeutic devices per
   dollar of research and development cost. Productivity declined for new
   pharmaceuticals.
   Conclusions Enhancing research productivity and evaluation of benefit
   are pressing challenges, requiring (1) more effective translation of
   basic scientific knowledge to clinical application; (2) critical
   appraisal of rapidly moving scientific areas to guide investment where
   clinical need is greatest, not only where commercial opportunity is
   currently perceived; and (3) more specific information about sources and
   uses of research funds than is generally available to allow informed
   investment decisions. Responsibility falls on industry, government, and
   foundations to bring these changes about with a longer-term view of
   research value.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the feasibility of a molecular wire system for sensing a
   molecule. For a general theoretical argument on this problem, we set up
   a model of a short conjugated molecular wire attached on both ends to
   metal electrodes. The binding of a target molecule is presumed to exert
   an effective local perturbation in the wire. We calculate the quantum
   transport through the molecular wire in terms of the Green's function
   method. Coulomb interactions are treated in the mean field approximation
   with the image charge effect taken into account. The electrostatic
   potential and the electron charge densities on the molecular wire are
   determined in a self-consistent manner. It is demonstrated that the
   current modulation by the local perturbation grows with increasing the
   applied voltage, thus making the molecular sensing feasible. The
   magnitude of modulation depends sensitively on the position of the local
   perturbation, implying that a precise molecular design is necessary for
   optimizing the device performance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although enthusiasm is growing for self-management programs
   for chronic conditions, there are conflicting data regarding their
   effectiveness and no agreement on their essential components.
   Purpose: To assess the effectiveness and essential components of
   self-management programs for hypertension, osteoarthritis, and diabetes
   mellitus.
   Data Sources: The authors searched multiple sources dated through
   September 2004, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PSycINFO, and
   Nursing and Allied Health databases, and bibliographies of 87 previous
   reviews.
   Study Selection: Randomized trials that compared outcomes of
   self-management interventions with a control or with usual care for
   diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, or hypertension; outcomes included
   hemoglobin A,c level, fasting blood glucose level, weight, blood
   pressure, pain, or function.
   Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently identified trials and
   extracted data regarding whether the intervention used tailored
   adjustments to meet individual patient needs, a group setting, feedback,
   and psychological services, and whether the intervention was provided by
   the patient's usual physician.
   Data Synthesis: Of 780 studies screened, 53 studies contributed data to
   the random-effects meta-analysis (26 diabetes studies, 14 osteoarthritis
   studies, and 13 hypertension studies). Self-management interventions led
   to a statistically and clinically significant pooled effect size of
   -0.36 (95\% CI, -0.52 to -0.21) for hemoglobin A,c, equivalent to a
   reduction in hemoglobin A,, level of about 0.81\%. Self-management
   interventions decreased systolic blood pressure by 5 mm Hg (effect size,
   -0.39 {[}CI, -0.51 to -0.28]) and decreased diastolic blood pressure by
   4.3 mm Hg (effect size, -0.51 {[}CI, -0.73 to -0.30]). Pooled effects of
   self-management interventions were statistically significant but
   clinically trivial for pain and function outcomes for osteoarthritis. No
   consistent results supported any of the 5 characteristics examined as
   essential for program success.
   Limitations: Studies had variable quality, and possible publication bias
   was evident.
   Conclusions: Self-management programs for diabetes mellitus and
   hypertension probably produce clinically important benefits. The
   elements of the programs most responsible for benefits cannot be
   determined from existing data, and this inhibits specification of
   optimally effective or cost-effective programs. Osteoarthritis
   self-management programs do not appear to have clinically beneficial
   effects on pain or function.}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin,
   play vital roles in development and maintenance of hard tissue (bone or

   material (the major component of hard tissue) for bone or dental tissue
   engineering. Realizing the natural affinity of ECM components toward
   inorganic constituents of hard tissue, we successfully constructed the
   nanohybrids of DNA/CaP particles with either collagen 1 or fibronectin,
   which finally possessed the capability of specific recognition of
   integrin receptor for being swiftly internalized across the plasma
   membrane, leading to remarkably high transgene expression in mammalian
   cells. This new approach with precise receptor-specific delivery as well
   as 10- to 50-fold enhanced efficiency level compared to the classical
   one, has immediate applications for basic research and large scale

Abstract = {{Purpose Cancer survivors smoke at rates that are only slightly lower
   than the general population. This article reports on the final outcomes
   of Partnership for Health, a smoking cessation intervention for smokers
   in the Childhood Cancer Survivors Study (CCSS).
   Methods This study is a randomized control trial with follow-up at 8 and
   12 months that involved smokers (n = 796) enrolled onto the CCSS cohort.
   Participants were randomly assigned to either a self-help or a
   peer-counseling program that included up to six telephone calls from a
   trained childhood cancer survivor, tailored and targeted materials, and
   free nicotine replacement therapy. The intervention was delivered by
   telephone and postal service mail.
   Results The quit rate was significantly higher in the counseling group
   compared with the self-help group at both the 8-month (16.8\% v 8.5\%; P
   < .01) and 12-month follow-ups (15\% v 9\%; P <= .01). Controlling for
   baseline self-efficacy and readiness to change, the intervention group
   was twice as likely to quit smoking, compared with the self-help group.
   Smoking cessation rate increased with an increase in the number of
   counseling calls. The cost of delivering the intervention was
   approximately \$300 per participant. The incremental cost-effectiveness
   of the intervention compared with controls was \$5,371 per additional
   quit.
   Conclusion Interventions to prevent future illnesses are of critical
   importance to childhood cancer survivors. The Partnership for Health
   intervention resulted in a doubling of smoking cessation quit rates.
   Because of the seriousness of smoking among childhood cancer survivors,
   this intervention model may be appropriate as a multicomponent treatment
   program for survivors who smoke.}},

Abstract = {{During Cluster's annual dayside seasons (November June) the four
   spacecraft cross the magnetopause at high latitudes near local noon, and
   at lower latitudes further along the flanks. During these crossings,
   observations of flux transfer events (FTEs), a signature of transient or
   variable-rate magnetopause merging, are often made. We have compiled a
   survey of FTEs observed by Cluster in the 2002/3 dayside season. A
   significant number of FTEs, presented here, were observed under strongly
   northward IMF. Multi-spacecraft techniques enable more accurate
   velocities to be calculated than previously possible. The observed
   velocities are consistent with a long, component merging X-line
   emanating from the antiparallel merging site in the lobe, but require a
   relaxation of the antiparallel merging hypothesis to allow the X-line to
   extend to regions of lower shear on the flank. The velocities observed
   at lower latitudes are not consistent with a subsolar X-line.}},

Abstract = {{Few genes have been implicated in the development of oral cancer. In our
   study, we identified a novel gene in the Rb pathway that is frequently
   altered and overexpressed in oral tumors. Significantly, the alteration
   is also associated with early oral premalignant lesions (OPLs). This
   region was identified through a genomewide scan using randomly amplified
   polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR of 40 microdissected oral squamous cell
   carcinomas (SCCs). Recurrent gain of a similar to 400 bp signal was
   observed in multiple patients. This gain was localized to 13q14.11, a
   region frequently altered in multiple cancer types. Through
   microsatellite analysis, a 1.9 Mbp minimal region of alteration (MRA)
   was defined between D13S263 and D13S1227. Allelic imbalance (AI) in the
   MRA was present in only 28\% of low-grade dysplasia, but strikingly
   increased with progression to 64\% in high-grade dysplasia, plateauing
   at 61\% in tumors, thus implicating this alteration in the early stages
   of disease development. Of the 3 genes residing within the MRA, Receptor
   Activator of NK-kappa-B Ligand (RANKL) and Diacylglycerol Kinase (DGKH)
   showed no change in expression levels in tumors compared to normal
   tissue. In contrast, 12 of 16 tumors showed significant overexpression
   of A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 220 (AKAP220). Since AKAP220 plays a role
   in regulating the Rb pathway, its dysregulation may contribute
   significantly to alterations in cell cycle regulation that facilitate
   progression of OPLs. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The structural ordering of mesogenic-terminated carbosilane dendrimers
   within surface monolayers was studied. We have shown that despite their
   symmetrical spherical shape layering with average spacing close to 6 nm
   is observed for dendrimers with butoxyphenylbenzoate terminal groups
   deposited on hydrophilic silicon substrates. The molecular layered
   packing is formed by flattened dendritic molecules with terminal groups
   stacking into bilayers. This layered ordering is controlled by strong
   interactions between the polar mesogenic groups and the hydrophilic
   surface and by microphase separation of the dendritic core and terminal
   groups. The dilution of the outer mesogenic shell with a nonmesogenic
   component partially disturbs the layered packing within the monolayer.
   Complete disruption of the regular lamellar ordering is observed if
   butoxypherylbenzoate terminal groups are replaced with shorter and more
   polar cyanbiphenyl groups. For all dendrimers studied here the
   replacement of the hydrophilic support with hydrophobic one prevents the
   formation of dense surface layers due to antagonistic interactions
   between polar terminal groups and a methyl-terminated surface. However,
   the presence of the nonmesogenic hydrophobic terminal groups stimulates
   the formation of two-dimensional circular molecular structures which are
   characteristic of columnar LC dendrimer phases.}},

Abstract = {{Endoglin (CD105) is a proliferation-associated protein that is strongly
   expressed in endothelial tissue and has a role in tumor angiogenesis.
   Mutations in endoglin are also linked to Hereditary Hemorrhagic
   Telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1), an autosomal dominant disease associated
   with aberrant angiogenesis. We report an unusual association of HHT1 and
   Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) in the same kindred.
   Genetic analysis indicates that these 2 syndromes are genetically
   unrelated and separately segregated within the family. The mutation in
   the endoglin gene leads to a truncated protein. The mutation in the
   mismatch repair gene MLH1 causes a splicing defect, giving synthesis to
   an unstable mRNA from this mutated allele. The potential protective role
   of an endoglin mutation in patients with HNPCC is discussed. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{In this study we examined diabetes- and hypertension-induced changes in
   cardiac structure and function in an animal model of type 2 diabetes,
   the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat. We hypothezised that treatment with
   omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, which causes simultaneous
   inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase,
   provides additional cardioprotective effects, during normal as well as
   high sodium intake, compared to treatment with enalapril, a selective
   inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme. Fifty-two GK rats were
   randomized into 6 groups to receive either normal-sodium (NaCl 0.8\%) or
   high-sodium (NaCl 6\%) diet and enalapril, omapatrilat or vehicle for 12
   weeks. The GK rats developed hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and
   overexpression of cardiac natriuretic peptides and profibrotic
   connective tissue growth factor compared to nondiabetic Wistar rats. The
   high dietary sodium further increased the systolic blood pressure, and
   changed the mitral inflow pattern measured by echocardiography towards
   diastolic dysfunction. Enalapril and omapatrilat equally decreased the
   systolic blood pressure compared to the control group during normal- as
   well as high-sodium diet. Both drugs had beneficial cardioprotective
   effects, which were blunted by the high dietary sodium. Compared to
   enalapril, omapatrilat reduced the echocardiographically measured left
   ventricular mass during normal-sodium diet and improved the diastolic
   function during high-sodium diet in GK rats. Furthermore, omapatrilat
   reduced relative cardiac weight more effectively than enalapril during
   high sodium intake. Our results suggest that both the renin-angiotensin
   and the neutral endopeptidase system are involved in the pathogenesis of
   diabetic cardiomyopathy since vasopeptidase inhibition was shown to
   provide additional benefits in comparison with selective angiotensin
   converting enzyme inhibition alone. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We investigated the recognition properties of different GABA(A) receptor
   subtypes and mutant receptors for the biflavonoid amentoflavone, a
   constituent of St. John's Wort. Radioligand binding studies showed that
   amentoflavone recognition paralleled that of the classical
   benzodiazepine diazepam in that it had little or no affinity for alpha
   4- or alpha 6-containing receptors. Lysine and alanine substitutions at
   position 101 of the rat alpha(1) subunit resulted in a complete loss of
   competitive amentoflavone binding, but functional analysis of the
   alanine mutant expressed with beta z and gamma 2 subunits in Xenopus
   oocytes revealed no significant difference in the negative modulation of
   GABA-induced currents brought about by amentoflavone. Furthermore,
   elimination of the gamma subunit had no effect on the negative
   modulation of these currents. This negative modulation was also observed
   at alpha(1)beta(1)gamma(2) GABA(A) receptors and is therefore not likely
   mediated by the loreclezole site. These results suggest a complex
   mechanism of amentoflavone interaction at GABA(A) receptors. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Purpose To describe total fatigue (TF) and chronic fatigue (CF) in 476
   long-term Hodgkin's disease survivors (HDSs). The development in CIF
   over time was explored in 280 of the patients who had also been assessed
   8 years earlier.
   Patients and Methods In 2003, the Fatigue Questionnaire was mailed to
   610 successfully treated HDSs at the Norwegian Radium Hospital from 1971
   to 1997. Mean TF scores and occurrence of CIF were compared with general
   population (GP) values.
   Results Four hundred seventy-six complete forms (81\%) were received
   (median age, 46 years; 56\% median follow-up time, 195 months). There
   was a positive association between age and TF (p < .05) whereas presence
   of B symptoms at diagnosis and treatment before 1980 were associated
   with CF. Mean TF scores were elevated in HDSs compared with the GP (mean
   TF score, 14.6; 95\% Cl, 14.1 to 15.7 v 12.1; 95\% Cl, 11.9 to 12.3,
   respectively; P < .001), as was the proportion of persons with CF (30\%
   v 11\%, respectively; odds ratio = 3.6; P < .001). The 70 patients with
   CF 8 years earlier still reported higher TF at follow-up than the 210
   patients without CF at the previous assessment (mean TF score, 17.0;
   95\% Cl, 15.6 to 18.3 v 13.1; 95\% Cl, 12.9 to 14.1, respectively; P <
   .001). Significantly more patients with persisting CF had B symptoms at
   diagnosis compared with patients who had recovered (P = .05). No
   significant association with treatment modality and intensity was found.
   Conclusion Fatigue remains a major complaint in HDSs several years after
   treatment, but the association between treatment and fatigue still
   remains unclear. Many HDSs may recover from CF, particularly patients
   without B symptoms at diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{For the proper design of supercritical fluid dyeing process, it is
   essential to have a sound knowledge of the solubilities of dyes and the
   accurate solubility representation. In this work, we employed four
   semiempirical density-based models (the Chrastil model, the Bartle
   model, the K-J model and the M-T model) to correlate solubilities of 32
   dyestuffs in supercritical carbon dioxide. The results show that these
   models perform very well with three temperature-independent parameters
   and could be applied for satisfactory solubility predictions. A
   comparison among the four models reveals that the In gamma 2 versus In
   rho Chrastil model gives much better correlations to the solubility data
   with an overall average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 20.6\%
   than the other three models. From the correlation results, the heat of
   dye-CO2 solvation and that of solute dye vaporization can be separately
   approximated in the range of 13.0-2 1.0 and 29.2-101.6 kJ/mol,
   respectively. Besides, the solubility discrepancies observed for certain
   dyestuffs have been discussed by using these density-based models. (c)

Abstract = {{Molecular docking uses the three-dimensional structure of a receptor to
   screen databases of small molecules for potential ligands, often based
   on energetic complementarity. For many docking scoring functions, which
   calculate nonbonded interactions, metalloenzymes are challenging because
   of the partial covalent nature of metal-ligand interactions. To
   investigate how well molecular docking can identify potential ligands of
   metalloenzymes using a ``standard{''} scoring function, we have docked
   the MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR), a functionally annotated database of 95
   000 small molecules, against the X-ray crystal structures of five
   metalloenzymes. These enzymes included three zinc proteases, the nickel
   analogue of an iron enzyme, and a molybdenum metalloenzyme. The ability
   of the docking program to retrospectively enrich the annotated ligands
   as high-scoring hits for each enzyme and to calculate proper geometries
   was evaluated. In all five systems, the annotated ligands within the
   MDDR were enriched at least 20 times over random. To test the approach
   prospectively, a sixth target, the zinc beta-lactamase from Bacteroides
   fragilis, was screened against the fragment-like subset of the ZINC
   database. We purchased and tested 15 compounds from among the top 50
   top-ranked ligands from docking, and found 5 inhibitors with apparent
   K-i values less than 120 mu M, the best of which was 2 mu M. A more
   ambitious test still was predicting actual substrates for a seventh
   target, a Zn-dependent phosphotriesterase from Pseudomonas diminuta.
   Screening the Available Chemicals Directory (ACD) identified 25
   thiophosphate esters as potential substrates within the top 100 ranked
   compounds. Eight of these, all previously uncharacterized for this
   enzyme, were acquired and tested, and all were confirmed experimentally
   as substrates. These results suggest that a simple, noncovalent scoring
   function may be used to identify inhibitors of at least some
   metalloenzymes.}},

Title = {{MAOA haplotypes associated with thrombocyte-MAO activity}},
Journal = {{BMC GENETICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: The aim was to ascertain whether thrombocyte MAO (trbc-MAO)
   activity and depressed state are genetically associated with the MAO
   locus on chromosome X (Xp11.3 - 11.4). We performed novel sequencing of
   the MAO locus and validated genetic variants found in public databases
   prior to constructing haplotypes of the MAO locus in a Swedish sample (N
   = 573 individuals).
   Results: Our results reveal a profound SNP desert in the MAOB gene. Both
   the MAOA and MAOB genes segregate as two distinct LD blocks. We found a
   significant association between two MAOA gene haplotypes and reduced
   trbc-MAO activity, but no association with depressed state.
   Conclusion: The MAO locus seems to have an effect on trbc-MAO activity
   in the study population. The findings suggest incomplete X-chromosome
   inactivation at this locus. It is plausible that a gene-dosage effect
   can provide some insight into the greater prevalence of depressed state
   in females than males.}},

Volume = {{631}},
Number = {{1, 1}},

Abstract = {{We model the galaxy formation in a series of high- resolution N- body
   simulations using the semianalytical approach. Unlike many earlier
   investigations based on semianalytical models, we make use of the
   subhalos resolved in the N- body simulations to follow the mergers of
   galaxies in dark halos, and we show that this is pivotal in modeling
   correctly the galaxy luminosity function at the bright end and the
   bimodal nature of galaxy color distribution. Mergers of galaxies based
   on subhalos also result in many more bright red galaxies at high z. The
   semianalytical model we adopt is similar to those used in earlier
   semianalytical studies, except that we consider the effect of a
   prolonged cooling in small halos and that we explicitly follow the
   chemical enrichment in the interstellar medium. We use our model to make
   predictions for the properties of the galaxy population at low redshift
   and compare them with various current observations. We find that our
   model predictions can match the luminosity functions of galaxies in
   various wavebands redder than the u band. The shape of the luminosity
   function at the bright end is well reproduced if galaxy mergers are
   modeled with the merger trees of subhalos, and the steep faint- end
   slope can be moderated if the gas cooling time in low- mass halos is
   comparable to the age of the universe. The model with subhalos resolved
   can reproduce the main features in the observed color bimodal
   distribution, although it still predicts too many bright blue galaxies.
   The same model can also match the color- magnitude relation for
   elliptical galaxies in clusters, the metallicity- luminosity relation
   and metallicity - rotation velocity relation of spiral galaxies, and the
   gas fraction in present- day spiral galaxies. We also identify areas
   where further improvements of the model are required.}},

Abstract = {{We study mechanical properties of polyelectrolyte multilayer
   microcapsules filled with polyelectrolyte solutions of high

   superswelling of microcapsules. The suppression of excess osmotic
   pressure causes a shrinking of capsules, which however do not return to
   their original, i.e., before swelling, size. To quantify these large and
   only partly reversible stretching of the shells, we develop a simple
   model, in which the stress-strain relation is constructed by mapping a
   linear model to two equilibrium, swollen and shrank, states. Fitting to
   predictions of this model shows that elastoplastic stretching of the
   multilayer is equivalent to a dramatic decrease in apparent Young's
   modulus, down to similar to 1 MPa in our experiment. This is in
   agreement with force-deformation profiles measured with the atomic force
   microscope, which show that superswollen capsules are ultrasoft.}},

Abstract = {{The aa(3)-type cytochrome c oxidases from mitochondria and bacteria
   contain a cation-binding site located in subunit I near heme a. In the
   oxidases from Paracoccus denitrificans or Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the
   site is occupied by tightly bound calcium, whereas the mitochondrial
   oxidase binds reversibly calcium or sodium that compete with each other.
   The functional role of the site has not yet been established. D477A
   mutation in subunit I of P. denitrificans oxidase converts the
   cation-binding site to a mitochondrial-type form that binds reversibly
   calcium and sodium ions {[}Pfitzner, U., Kirichenko, A., et al. (1999)
   FEBS Lett. 456, 365-369]. We have studied reversible cation binding with
   P. denitrificans D477A oxidase and compared it with that in bovine
   enzyme. In bovine oxidase, one Ca2+ competes with two Na+ for the
   binding, indicating the presence of two Na+-binding sites in the enzyme,
   Na-(1)(+) and Na-(2)(+). In contrast, the D477A mutant of COX from P.
   denitrificans reveals competition of Ca2+ (K-d = 1 mu M) with only one
   sodium ion (K-d = 4 mM). The second binding site for Na+ in bovine
   oxidase is proposed to involve D442, homologous to D477 in P.
   denitrificans oxidase. A putative place for Na+(2) in subunit I of
   bovine oxidase has been found with the aid of structure modeling located
   7.4 angstrom from the bound Na-(1)(+). Na-(2)(+) interacts with a
   cluster of residues forming an exit part of the so-called H-proton
   channel, including D51 and S441.}},

Abstract = {{In transonic flow conditions, the shock wave/turbulent boundary layer
   interaction and flow separations on wing upper surface induce flow
   instabilities, `buffet', and then the buffeting (structure vibrations).
   This phenomenon can greatly influence the aerodynamic performance. These
   flow excitations are self-sustained and lead to a surface effort due to
   pressure fluctuations. They can produce enough energy to excite the
   structure. The objective of the present work is to predict this unsteady
   phenomenon correctly by using unsteady Navier-Stokes-averaged equations
   with a time-dependent turbulence model based on the suitable (k-epsilon)
   turbulent eddy viscosity model. The model used is based on the turbulent
   viscosity concept where the turbulent viscosity coefficient C mu is
   related to local deformation and rotation rates. To validate this model,
   flow over a flat plate at Mach number of 0.6 is first computed, then the
   flow around a NACA0012 airfoil. The comparison with the analytical and
   experimental results shows a good agreement. The ONERA OAT15A transonic
   airfoil was chosen to describe buffeting phenomena. Numerical
   simulations are done by using a Navier-Stokes SUPG (streamline upwind
   Petrov-Galerkin) finite-element solver. Computational results show the
   ability of the present model to predict physical phenornena of the flow
   oscillations. The unsteady shock wave/boundary layer interaction is
   described. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Angiopoietin-like protein (Angptl) 1 and Angptl2, which are considered
   orphan ligands, are highly homologous, particularly in the
   fibrinogen-like domain containing the putative receptor binding site.
   This similarity suggests potentially cooperative functions between the
   two proteins. In this report, the function of Angptl1 and Angptl2 is
   analyzed by using morpholino antisense technology in zebrafish.
   Knockdown of both Angptl1 and Angptl2 produced severe vascular defects
   due to increased apoptosis of endothelial cells at the sprouting stage.
   In vitro studies showed that Angptl1 and Angptl2 have antiapoptotic
   activities through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, and
   coinjection of constitutively active Akt/protein kinase B mRNA rescued
   impaired vascular development seen in double knockdown embryos. These
   results provide a physiological demonstration of the cooperative
   interaction of Angptl1 and Angptl2 in enclothelial cells through
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt mediated antiapoptotic activities.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES We sought to determine whether elimination of pulmonary vein
   (PV) arrhythmogenicity is necessary for the efficacy of left atrial
   circumferential ablation (LACA) for atrial fibrillation (AF).
   BACKGROUND The PVs often provide triggers or drivers of AF. It has been
   shown that LACA is more effective than PV isolation in eliminating
   paroxysmal AF. However, it is not clear whether complete PV isolation is
   necessary for the efficacy of LACA.
   METHODS In 60 consecutive patients with paroxysmal (n = 39) or chronic
   (n = 21) AF (mean age 53 +/- 12 years), LACA to encircle the left- and
   right-sided PVs, with additional lines in the posterior left atrium and
   along the mitral isthmus, was performed under the guidance of an
   electroanatomic navigation system. The PVs were mapped with a decapolar
   ring catheter before and after LACA. If PV isolation was incomplete, no
   attempts at complete isolation were made.
   RESULTS After LACA, there was incomplete electrical isolation of one or
   more PVs in 48 (80\%) of the 60 patients. The prevalence of PV
   tachycardias was 82\% before and 8\% after LACA (p < 0.001). At 11 +/- 1
   months of follow-up,10 (83\%) of the 12 patients with complete and 39
   (81\%) of 48 patients with incomplete PV isolation were free from
   recurrent AF without antiarrhythmic drug therapy (p = 1.0). A successful
   outcome was not related to the number of completely isolated PVs per
   patient (p = 0.6).
   CONCLUSIONS Left atrial circumferential ablation modifies the
   arrhythmogenic substrate within the PVs. Complete electrical isolation
   of the PVs is not a requirement for a successful outcome after LACA.}},

Abstract = {{In rapidly rotating convective stars, the effect of Coriolis forces is
   predominant and the dynamics of convective instabilities is
   fundamentally different from that in slowly rotating stars. Coriolis
   forces not only enforce two-dimensionality of the fluid motions driven
   by convective instabilities but also generate strong differential
   rotation even in the vicinity of the onset of the instabilities. This
   characteristic suggests a quasi-geostrophic approximation taking
   advantage of quasi two-dimensionality of the fluid motions. We
   investigate convective instabilities and differential rotation generated
   by the instabilities in rapidly rotating stars using a new
   quasi-geostrophic approximation incorporating full spherical geometry
   and the equation of mass conservation. We model a rapidly rotating
   stellar convection zone of inner radius r(i) and outer radius r(o) by a
   large-gap spherical annulus defined by s(i) <= s <= s(o) and -(r(o)(2) -
   s(2))(1/2) <= z <= (r(o)(2)-s(2))(1/2), where ( s, phi, z) are
   cylindrical polar coordinates with the axis of rotation at s = 0 and
   r(i) = s(i) < s(o) approximate to r(o). In the limits si ! 0 and so !
   ro, the corresponding spherical annulus represents a fully convective
   rapidly rotating star in the full sphere. For the purpose of comparison,
   fully three-dimensional solutions in spherical geometry are also
   calculated. It is demonstrated that the primary features of the
   convective instabilities in rapidly rotating spheres or spherical shells
   are quantitatively captured by large-gap spherical annuli using the new
   quasi-geostrophic approximation, providing an exciting opportunity to
   analyze and compute convective flows in rapidly rotating stars ( very
   small Ekman numbers), which cannot be achieved by fully
   three-dimensional numerical simulations. Implications of the results for
   several rapidly rotating stars are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations in DNA MMR genes, mainly MSH2 and MLH1, account for the
   majority of HNPCC, an autosomal dominant predisposition to colorectal
   cancer and other malignancies. The evaluation of many questions
   regarding HNPCC requires clinically and genetically well-characterized
   HNPCC patient cohorts of reasonable size. One main focus of this
   multicenter study is the evaluation of the mutation spectrum and
   mutation frequencies in a large HNPCC cohort in Germany; 1,721 unrelated
   patients, mainly of German descent, who met the Bethesda criteria were
   included in the study. In tumor samples of 1,377 patients,
   microsatellite analysis was successfully performed and the results were
   applied to select patients eligible for mutation analysis. In the
   patients meeting the strict Amsterdam criteria (AC) for HNPCC, 72\% of
   the tumors exhibited high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) while only
   37\% of the tumors from patients fulfilling the less stringent criteria
   showed NISI-H; 454 index patients (406 MSI-H and 48 meeting the AC of
   whom no tumor samples were available) were screened for small mutations.
   In 134 index patients, a pathogenic MSH2 mutation, and in 118 patients,
   a pathogenic MLH1 mutation was identified (overall detection rate for
   pathogenic mutations 56\%). One hundred sixty distinct mutations were
   detected, of which 86 are novel mutations. Noteworthy is that 2
   mutations were over-represented in our patient series: MSH2,c.942+3A > T
   and MLH1,c.1489\_1490insC, which account for 11\% and 18\% of the MSH2
   and MLH1 mutations, respectively. A subset of 238 patients was screened
   for large genomic deletions. In 24 (10\%) patients, a deletion was
   found. In 72 patients, only unspecified variants were found. Our
   findings demonstrate that preselection by microsatellite analysis
   substantially raises mutation detection rates in patients not meeting
   the AC. As a mutation detection strategy for German HNPCC patients, we
   recommend to start with screening for large genomic deletions and to
   continue by screening for common mutations in exon 5 of MSH2 and exon 13
   of MLH1 before searching for small mutations in the remaining exons. (c)

Abstract = {{alpha nu beta 8 integrin is highly expressed in the vertebrate CNS, and
   mice lacking the alpha nu or beta 8 genes develop cerebral hemorrhage
   due to defective interactions between blood vessels and alpha nu beta
   8-expressing neural cells. Although alpha nu beta 8 binds many of the
   same extracellular matrix protein ligands as other integrins, very
   little is known about the intracellular signal transduction events used
   by alpha nu beta 8 to regulate CNS development. Here we identify Band
   4.1B as an intracellular factor that interacts selectively with the beta
   8 cytoplasmic tail. The association with alpha nu beta 8 occurs via the
   band 4.1B C-terminal domain, a region highly conserved among the various
   Band 4.1 family members. indeed, we show that beta 8 integrin interacts
   directly with the C-terminal domains of several Band 4.1 proteins and
   colocalizes with them in cultured astrocytes and in the brain. These
   data identify a previously uncharacterized interaction between an

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop a novel lectin-conjugated
   isopropyl myristate (IPM)-incorporated PLGA nanoparticle system (NP) for
   the local delivery of paclitaxel to the lungs. neat germ agglutinin
   (WGA) was conjugated onto preformed IPM- and paclitaxel-loaded PLGA NPs
   by a two-step carbodiimide method following comparative uptake studies
   of Concanavalin A, Ricinus communis-120 and WGA on A549, H1299 and
   CCL-186 cells. WIT-NP with mean diameter of 33 1 rim and zeta potential
   of -4.3 mV were prepared with yield of 66\% and paclitaxel encapsulation
   efficiency of 61\%. Particle size was expanded by surface conjugation
   with WGA, while zeta potential was reduced by the addition of IPM and
   WGA. In vitro paclitaxel release profile was not affected by WGA but
   initial drug release was enhanced by adding IPM into the formulation.
   The WIT-NP showed a burst-release of about 32\% of the paclitaxel load
   within the first 5 h followed by a slow zero-order release of another
   7\% of the drug load in the next 115 h. Compared with the clinical
   paclitaxel formulation, paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles without IPM or
   WGA, or paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles with only IPM or WGA, the WIT-NP
   had superior in vitro cytotoxicity against A549 and H 1299 cells. IC50
   for WIT-NP after 5 and 24 h incubation with A549 cells were not
   significantly different (15.5 and 15 mu M, respectively) whereas the
   clinical formulation was not cytotoxic after 5 h but had IC50 of 14 mu M
   after 24 h incubation. WIT-NP exhibited stronger cell-killing effect
   because of more efficient cellular uptake via WGA-receptor-mediated
   endocytosis and IPM-facilitated release of paclitaxel from the NPs. (c)

   indicate differences in potential dependencies of concentration of

   indicating an influence of the alkyl side chain length on specific
   properties of paramagnetic charge carriers appearing in these polymers
   in the course of their redox processes. Compared to their parent polymer
   - PEDOT, some similarities in the behaviour of charge carries may be
   observed notably the hysteresis of potential dependence of concentration

   mechanism of these polymers may resemble the one in PEDOT.}},

Abstract = {{From our previous observation, it is known that
   tau-(EDO-R,R-DMEDT-TTF)(2)(AuBr2)(1+y) (y <= 0.875) exhibits strong
   sample dependence in the temperature dependence of its resistance R(7).
   Some samples are metallic down to 4.2 K, while others show upturn below
   around 50 K. To investigate the origin of the sample dependence, we
   performed Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effect for four samples. Here two
   samples show metallic behavior, while other samples exhibit nonmetallic
   below 50 K. From the observation of the SdH oscillation, we detect two
   series of two-dimensional (21)) Fermi surfaces (FS's) pockets for all
   samples. Interestingly, we find slight scatter in the area of FS, but no
   correlation is found between R(T) and FS area. The origin of the slight
   difference in the FS areas is discussed in terms of possible difference
   in the band filling.}},

Volume = {{631}},
Number = {{1, 1}},

Abstract = {{Self-interacting dark matter has been proposed as a hypothesis to
   explain the shallow central slopes of the density profiles of dark
   matter halos in galaxies. In order to be consistent with observational
   studies at scales of galaxy clusters, the cross section should scale
   inversely with the velocity of collision. In this paper we consider the
   mass density profile of the halo of the low surface brightness (LSB)
   galaxy NGC 5963 to place an upper limit on the dark matter cross section
   for collisions with velocities similar to 150 km s(-1), i.e., at the
   low-velocity regime. After calibrating against cosmological simulations,
   we found that the large inferred dark matter concentration and central
   dark matter density in NGC 5963 are inconsistent with an effective
   collisional cross section per unit of mass > 0.2 cm(2) g(-1).
   Corrections were applied in order to account for reduction of the core
   by the adiabatic contraction caused by cooling baryons. Our limits,
   which involve a number of simplifying, but always conservative,
   assumptions, exclude the last permitted interval for velocity-dependent
   cross sections to explain the flat density core in LSB galaxies.
   Implications for the nature of dark matter are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The study aimed to assess the ability of remote sensing to differentiate
   between plant stress caused by natural gas leakage and other stresses.
   In order to use satellite remote sensing to detect gas leaks it is
   necessary to determine whether the cause of the stress can be identified
   in the spectral response and distinguished from other stress factors.
   Field plots of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) were stressed using
   elevated levels of natural gas in the soil, dilute herbicide solution
   and extreme shade. Visible stress response, spectral stress response and
   chlorophyll content of plants from these three treatments were compared
   to control plants receiving no treatment. The reflectance from isolated
   leaves was measured in the laboratory. Spectral responses to stress
   included increased reflectance in the visible wavelengths and decreased
   reflectance in the near-infrared. A shift of the red edge position
   towards shorter wavelengths was observed as a result of all three
   stresses, although the shift was greatest when stressed via extreme
   shade. Red edge position was strongly correlated with chlorophyll
   content across all the treatments. The ratio of reflectances centred on
   the wavelengths 670 and 560 nm was used to detect increases in red
   pigmentation in gassed and herbicide-stressed leaves. Stress due to
   extreme shade could be distinguished from stress caused by natural gas
   or herbicide by changes in the reflectance spectra, however, stress
   caused by herbicide or natural gas could not be distinguished from one
   another in the spectra although symptoms of stress caused by elevated
   gas levels were identified earlier than symptoms caused by
   herbicide-induced stress.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The relationships between mismatch repair (MMR) protein
   expression, microsatellite instability (MSI), family history, and
   germline MMR gene mutation status have not been studied on a population
   basis.
   Methods We studied 131 unselected patients with colorectal cancer
   diagnosed younger than age 45 years. For the 105 available tumors, MLH1,
   MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 protein expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC)
   and MSI were measured. Germline DNA was screened for hMLH1, hMSH2,
   hMSH6, and hPMS2 mutations for the following patients: all from families
   fulfilling the Amsterdam Criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal
   cancer (HNPCC); all with tumors that were high MSI, low MSI, or that
   lacked expression of any MMR protein; and a random sample of 23 with
   MS-stable tumors expressing all MMR proteins.
   Results Germline mutations were found in 18 patients (nine hMLH1, four
   hMSH2, four hMSH6, and one hPMS2); all tumors exhibited loss of MMR
   protein expression, all but one were high MSI or low MSI, and nine were
   from a family fulfilling Amsterdam Criteria. Sensitivities of IHC
   testing, MSI (high or low), and Amsterdam Criteria for MMR gene mutation
   were 100\%, 94\%, and 50\%, respectively. Corresponding positive
   predictive values were 69\%, 50\%, and 75\%.
   Conclusions Tumor IHC analysis of four MMR proteins and MSI testing
   provide a highly sensitive strategy for identifying MMR gene
   mutation-carrying, early-onset colorectal cancer patients, half of whom
   would have been missed using Amsterdam Criteria alone. Tumor-based
   approaches for triaging early-onset colorectal cancer patients for MMR
   gene mutation testing, irrespective of family history, appear to be an
   efficient screening strategy for HNPCC.}},

Abstract = {{Atom transfer radical polymerization technique was used to synthesize
   poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(methacrylic acid) (PEO-b-PMAA)
   copolymer, which was employed as a template for the controlled
   precipitation of calcium phosphate from aqueous solution at different pH
   values. The interactions between polymer and inorganic ions were studied
   using Ca2+ ion selective electrode, which indicated a possible weak
   interaction between Ca2+ and PEO segments, in addition to the
   interaction between Ca2+ and MAA segments. Two interesting
   superstructures consisting of an organized inorganic/organic hybrid
   material were characterized by electron microscopy. At pH similar to 4.0
   a nested structure consisting of hybrid nanofilaments was obtained. The
   fibers originate from a core of a size similar to that of the primary
   polymer aggregates, suggesting that cooperative interactions at a local
   level between dissolving calcium phosphate clusters and disassembling
   polymer segments may be responsible for the highly anisotropic character
   of the secondary growth process. At pH similar to 9.0 fractal growth
   morphology was obtained through the mineralization process. Such calcium
   phosphate/polymer nanohybrids with complex morphologies are interesting
   and might also be useful as novel ceramic precursors, reinforcing
   fillers, or biomedical implants.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the relationship between sea surface temperature
   (SST) variability occurring over the Indian Ocean and winter rainfall
   variability in eastern Australia. Six indices of SST variability are
   compared and their relationship to rainfall over eastern Australia is
   determined. An analysis of historical rainfall data for Queensland, New
   South Wales, and Victoria reveals that a strong relationship exists
   between a number of these indices and winter rainfall. In particular,
   anomalous SSTs over the Indonesian region provide a good indication of
   winter rainfall variability in eastern Australia. Additionally, this
   relationship is shown to hold true irrespective of potential impacts on
   rainfall by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A possible physical
   process by which the Indian Ocean SST anomalies may influence winter
   rainfall is proposed, involving their impact on the nature of the
   northwest Australian cloud band. This study demonstrates marked controls
   on winter climate variability comparable to that induced in summer by
   the better known ENSO processes and hence offers improved understanding
   of year-round seasonal climates.}},

Abstract = {{The fit locus, encoding two proteins, FitA and FitB, was identified in a
   genetic screen for Neisseria gonorrhoeae determinants that affect
   trafficking across polarized epithelial cells. To better understand how
   the locus may control these activities, we have undertaken a biochemical
   analysis of FitA and FitB. FitA is a DNA-binding protein with a putative
   ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) motif. Purified FitA forms a homodimer that
   binds a 150 bp fit promoter sequence containing the translational start
   site. A putative beta strand mutant of FitA, FitA(R7A), is unable to
   bind this DNA, supporting further that FitA is a RHH protein. FitB
   interacts with FitA to form a 98 kDa complex. FitA/B binds DNA with a
   38-fold higher affinity than the FitA homodimer. In DNase I footprint
   assays, FitA/B protects a 62-bp region within the fit promoter
   containing the predicted -10 sequence and an 8-bp inverted repeat,
   TGCTATCAN(12)-TGATAGCA. FitA/B-His is able to bind to either half-site
   alone with high affinity.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent nanocrystal-polymer composites were prepared from aqueous
   CdTe nanocrystals via two related routes. Route 1 was summarized as CFP
   (coating followed by polymerization), coating CdTe nanocrystals with
   polymerizable surfactant of octadecyl-p-vinylbenzyldimethylammonium
   chloride (OVDAC), followed by the copolymerization of OVDAC-coated CdTe
   with radical monomers to achieve nanocrystal-polymer bulk composites.
   Route 2 was summarized as PFC (polymerization followed by coating),
   coating CdTe directly with the copolymers of OVDAC and styrene to
   achieve processable nanocrystal-polymer composites. Both of these two
   methods avoided the exchange of surface ligands of nanocrystals.
   Photoluminescence (PL) quenching from free radicals was observed in the
   CFP method, which depended strongly on both the size of the nanocrystals
   and the species of the thiol stabilizers. We attributed it to the
   distinct surface composition of each nanocrystal sample. With control of
   the surface composition of the nanocrystals, this PL quenching could be
   effectively avoided. The PFC method obviated handling nanocrystals in
   the polymerization process and thus the maximum PL was retained.}},

Title = {{Endothelial apoptotic activity of angiocidin is dependent on its

Abstract = {{We recently cloned the full-length cDNA of a tumour-associated protein.
   The recombinant protein expressed in bacteria and referred to as
   angiocidin has potent antitumour activity in vivo and in vitro.
   Angiocidin inhibits tumour growth and angiogenesis by inducing apoptosis
   in endothelial cells. Based on the sequence similarity of angiocidin to
   S5a, one of the major polyubiquitin recognition proteins in eukaryotic
   cells, we postulated that the antiendothelial activity of angiocidin
   could be due in part to its polyubiquitin binding activity. In support
   of this hypothesis, we show that angiocidin binds polyubiquitin in vivo
   with high affinity and colocalises with ubiquitinated proteins on the
   surface of endothelial cells. Binding is blocked with an antiubiquitin
   antibody. Angiocidin treatment of endothelial cells transfected with a
   proteasome fluorescent reporter protein showed a dose-dependent
   inhibition of proteasome activity and accumulation of polyubiquitinated
   proteins. Full-length angiocidin bound polyubiquitin while three
   angiocidin recombinant proteins whose putative polyubiquitin binding
   sites were mutated either failed to bind polyubiquitin or had
   significantly diminished binding activity. The in vitro apoptotic
   activity of these mutants correlated with their polyubiquitin binding
   activity. These data strongly argue that the apoptotic activity of
   angiocidin is dependent on its polyubiquitin binding activity.}},

Abstract = {{The ventral striatum mediates goal-directed behaviors based, in part, on
   inputs from the amygdala. However, striatal areas caudal to the ventral
   striatum also receive inputs from the amygdala. In primates, the
   amygdala projects to the central ventral putamen, lateral
   amygdalostriatal area, and caudal ventral putamen, suggesting that these
   regions are also ``limbic-related.{''} The anterior insula, which
   integrates sensory and amygdaloid inputs, projects to the classic
   ventral striatum. We used retrograde and anterograde tract tracing
   techniques to determine the extent to which specific subdivisions of the
   insula influence the caudal ventral striatum in the primate. The
   anterior (agranular and rostral dysgranular) insula has significant
   inputs to caudal ventral striatal regions that receive projections from
   the amygdala. In contrast, the posterior (granular) insula has sparse
   projections. Within the agranular insula, the posteromedial agranular
   (Iapm), lateral agranular (Ial), and posterolateral agranular (Iapl)
   subdivisions have the strongest inputs. These subdivisions mediate
   olfactory, gustatory, and visceral information processing (Carmichael
   and Price JL {[}1996b] J. Comp. Neurol. 363:642-640). In contrast, the
   intermediate agranular subdivision (Iai) is relatively devoid of
   visceral/gustatory inputs and has few inputs. In summary, caudal ventral
   striatal areas that receive amygdaloid inputs also receive significant
   innervation by agranular and dysgranular insula subdivisions that are
   themselves connected with the amygdala. Within this projection, the Ial,
   Iapm, and Iapl make the strongest contribution, suggesting that highly
   processed visceral/autonomic information, taste, and olfaction influence
   behavioral responses mediated by the caudal ventral striatum.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a Th1-mediated
   inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), is a model of
   human multiple sclerosis. Cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha (
   cPLA(2)alpha), which initiates production of prostaglandins,
   leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor, is present in EAE lesions.
   Using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunization, as well as
   an adoptive transfer model, we showed that cPLA2(alpha)(-/-) mice are
   resistant to EAE. Histologic examination of the CNS from MOG-immunized
   mice revealed extensive inflammatory lesions in the cPLA(2)alpha(+/+)
   mice, whereas the lesions in cPLA(2)alpha(-/-) mice were reduced greatly
   or completely absent. MOG-specific T cells generated from WT mice
   induced less severe EAE in cPLA(2)alpha(-/-) mice compared with cPLA2
   alpha(-/-) mice, which indicates that cPLA(2)alpha plays a role in the
   effector phase of EAE. Additionally, MOG-specific T cells from
   cPLA(2)alpha(-/-) mice, transferred into WT mice, induced EAE with
   delayed onset and lower severity compared with EAE that was induced by
   control cells; this indicates that cPLA(2)alpha also plays a role in the
   induction phase of EAE. MOG-specific T cells from cPLA(2)alpha(-/-) mice
   were deficient in production of Th1-type cytokines. Consistent with this
   deficiency, in vivo administration of IL-12 rendered cPLA(2)alpha(-/-)
   mice susceptible to EAE. Our data indicate that cPLA(2)alpha plays an
   important role in EAE development and facilitates differentiation of T

Abstract = {{The use of large-mode-area tapered holey fibers with collapsed air holes
   for refractive index sensing is demonstrated. The collapsing of the

   method. This non adiabatic process makes the core mode to couple to
   multiple modes of the solid taper waist. Owing to the beating between
   the modes the transmission spectra of the tapered holey fibers exhibit
   several interference peaks. They shift remarkable to longer wavelengths
   as the external index increases. The multiple peaks, combined with a
   fitting algorithm, may allow high-accuracy refractometric measurements

Abstract = {{An equation of state to determine the thermodynamic properties of a
   gaseous substance from precise experimental data is described and
   applied to argon. The method is based on a truncated virial equation in
   which the fourth coefficient is exact at the level of graphs that are at
   most linear in non-additive three-body forces. For argon, the method
   predicted the ordinary virial coefficients B and C and their acoustic
   analogues beta and gamma; in addition, reasonably accurate values of the
   fourth virial coefficient and its acoustic parallel 8 were obtained. The
   pair- and triplet-potential parameters for argon derived from the model
   are in close agreement with other current estimates.
   The resulting equation of state predicted all interesting thermodynamic
   properties of gaseous argon over a wide range of temperatures at
   densities of at least one-third the critical value with very good
   accuracy, though not always to their experimental uncertainties. (C)

Abstract = {{We exposed H-2-loaded optical fibers to cw UV light and simultaneously

   UV-induced blue luminescence experiences a non monotonous evolution and

   blue luminescence and the refractive index changes in the range 5 10(-4)
   < Delta n(mean) (or Delta n(mod)) < 2.5 10(-3). Using this property, we
   analyze a fiber Bragg grating by focusing a UV beam probe onto the fiber
   core and we record the UV-induced blue luminescence at the end of the
   fiber. By scanning the UV beam along the fiber, we measure thus the
   axial profile of the refractive index changes with a spatial resolution

Abstract = {{Aurora kinases are key regulators of chromosome segregation during
   mitosis. We have previously shown by microarray analysis of primary lung
   carcinomas and matched normal tissue that AURKB ( 22 out of 37) and
   AURKA ( 15 out of 37) transcripts are frequently over-represented in
   these tumours. We now confirm these observations in a second series of
   44 carcinomas and also show that aurora B kinase protein levels are
   raised in the tumours compared to normal tissue. Elevated levels of
   expression in tumours are not a consequence of high-level amplification
   of the AURKB gene. Using a coding sequence polymorphism we show that in
   most cases ( seven out of nine) tumour expression is predominantly
   driven from one AURKB allele. Given the function of aurora B kinase, we
   examined whether there was an association between expression levels and
   genetic instability. We defined two groups of high and low AURKB
   expression. Using a panel of 10 microsatellite markers, we found that
   the group showing the higher level of expression had a higher frequency
   of allelic imbalance ( P = 0.0012). Analysis of a number of other genes
   that are strongly and specifically expressed in tumour over normal lung,
   including SERPINB5, TERT and PRAME, showed marked allelic expression
   imbalances in the tumour tissue in the context of balanced or only
   marginally imbalanced relative allelic copy numbers. Our data support a
   model of early carcinogenesis wherein defects in the process of
   inactivation of lung stem-cell associated genes during differentiation,
   contributes to the development of carcinogenesis.}},

   L-lactate acts as a bidentate ligand replacing two water molecules in
   the inner coordination sphere of the Gd-III ion. It has been found that
   the exchange rate of the coordinated L-lactate is modulated by the
   structural and electronic properties of the parent Gd-heptacoordinated
   macrocyclic chelate. In addition to the characterisation of the
   relaxation behaviour of the H-1 methyl resonance Of L-lactate, this
   study has been extended to its C-13 isomer (fully enriched at the three
   positions) and to the trifluoro-L-lactate. The obtained results may be

Abstract = {{A series of alumina-supported cobalt-molybdenum catalysts were prepared
   by the incipient-wetness method. Different calcination temperatures
   (673-873 K) and durations (2-96 h) were used to obtain the catalysts.
   Samples of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS). Depending on the calcination condition, two forms of
   molybdenum (Mo4+ and Mo6+) and Sulfur (S-1 and S-2) were identified. The
   ratio of Mo4+/MO6+ appeared to be affected more by the duration than by
   the calcination temperature. However, increase in the calcination
   temperature (673-873 K) led to ail increase in the amount of cobalt
   interacting with the alumina support, with a corresponding decrease in
   Co-Mo-S ensembles. The catalysts were tested in hydrodesulfurization of
   dibenzothiophene (DBT). The catalyst with 24 h calcination time
   exhibited the highest DBT conversion. For the catalyst at a conversion
   of 38.8\%, biphenyl (BP) and cyclohexylbenzene (CHB) were produced with
   selectivities of 82.8 and 17.2\%, respectively. When either the
   calcination temperature or duration was increased, a smaller amount of

Abstract = {{Question under study: Critically ill patients can develop muscle
   weakness that prolongs recovery. The aim of this study was to evaluate
   contractile parameters of the involuntary isometric skeletal muscle
   forces as measures of muscle weakness in critically ill patients.
   Methods: Prospective, controlled trial performed in an intensive care
   unit (ICU) of a university hospital. Subjects: 19 critically ill
   patients (diagnoses: intracranial bleeding n = 9; sepsis n = 6; others n
   = 4), who were ventilated and completely immobilised for one week. 20
   healthy volunteers served as controls. We measured peak torques (PT),
   contraction times, half-relaxation times, peak rates of torque
   development and decay and torque latencies of the ankle dorsiflexors of
   the foot after peroneal nerve stimulation.
   Results: Patients (median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
   II score 21) had reduced PTs, medians 3.3 Nm (interquartile range 2.5
   Nm) vs 4.1 Nm (2.0 Nm) in controls (P = 0.0003) for single pulse, 4.9
   (4.7) vs 8.1 Nm (3.8) (P = 0.0001) for 2-pulse, 6.1 (6.3) vs 10.3 Nm
   (3.9) (P = 0.0009) for 3-pulse and 7.3 (6.4) vs 11.6 Nm (7.8), (P =
   0.006) for 4-pulse stimulations, respectively. Contraction times were
   reduced and half-relaxation times increased compared with controls.
   Conclusions: Assessment of involuntary isometric skeletal muscle forces
   can be readily measured in critically ill patients. After one week of
   critical illness, these patients have decreased force compared with
   healthy controls. This assessment approach will be further evaluated in
   a long-term study with a larger patient population.}},

Abstract = {{ClC proteins are a family of chloride channels and transporters that are
   found in a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell types. The
   mammalian voltage-gated chloride channel ClC-1 is important for
   controlling the electrical excitability of skeletal muscle. Reduced
   excitability of muscle cells during metabolic stress can protect cells
   from metabolic exhaustion and is thought to be a major factor in
   fatigue. Here we identify a novel mechanism linking excitability to
   metabolic state by showing that ClC-1 channels are modulated by ATP. The
   high concentration of ATP in resting muscle effectively inhibits ClC-1
   activity by shifting the voltage gating to more positive potentials. ADP
   and AMP had similar effects to ATP, but IMP had no effect, indicating
   that the inhibition of ClC-1 would only be relieved under anaerobic
   conditions such as intense muscle activity or ischemia, when depleted
   ATP accumulates as IMP. The resulting increase in ClC-1 activity under
   these conditions would reduce muscle excitability, thus contributing to
   fatigue. We show further that the modulation by ATP is mediated by
   cystathionine beta-synthase-related domains in the cytoplasmic C
   terminus of ClC-1. This defines a function for these domains as
   gating-modulatory domains sensitive to intracellular ligands, such as
   nucleotides, a function that is likely to be conserved in other ClC
   proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Mycolic acids are the dominant feature of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   cell wall. These alpha-alkyl, beta-hydroxy fatty acids are formed by the
   condensation of two fatty acids, a long meromycolic acid and a shorter
   C-24-C-26 fatty acid. The component fatty acids are produced via a
   combination of type I and II fatty acid synthases (FAS) with FAS-I
   products being elongated by FAS-II toward meromycolic acids. The
   beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III encoded by mtfabH
   (mtFabH) links FAS-I and FAS-II, catalyzing the condensation of
   FAS-I-derived acyl-CoAs with malonyl-acyl carrier protein ( ACP). The
   acyl-CoA chain length specificity of mtFabH was assessed in vitro; the
   enzyme extended longer, physiologically relevant acyl-CoA primers when
   paired with AcpM, its natural partner, than with Escherichia coli ACP.
   The ability of the enzyme to use E. coli ACP suggests that a similar
   mode of binding is likely with both ACPs, yet it is clear that unique
   factors inherent to AcpM modulate the substrate specificity of mtFabH.
   Mutation of proposed key mtFabH residues was used to define their
   catalytic roles. Substitution of supposed acyl-CoA binding residues
   reduced transacylation, with double substitutions totally abrogating
   activity. Mutation of Arg(46) revealed its more critical role in
   malonyl-AcpM decarboxylation than in the acyl-CoA binding role.
   Interestingly, this effect was suppressed intragenically by Arg(161) ->
   Ala substitution. Our structural studies suggested that His(258),
   previously implicated in malonyl-ACP decarboxylation, also acts as an
   anchor point for a network of water molecules that we propose promotes
   deprotonation and transacylation of Cys(122).}},

Abstract = {{The energetic contributions of individual DNA-contacting side chains to
   specific DNA recognition in the human papillomavirus 16 E2C-DNA complex
   is small (less than 1.0 kcal mol(-1)), independent of the physical and
   chemical nature of the interaction, and is strictly additive. The sum of
   the individual contributions differs 1.0 kcal mol(-1) from the binding
   energy of the wild- type protein. This difference corresponds to the
   contribution from the deformability of the DNA, known as ``indirect
   readout.{''} Thus, we can dissect the energetic contribution to DNA
   binding into 90\% direct and 10\% indirect readout components. The lack
   of high energy interactions indicates the absence of ``hot spots,{''}
   such as those found in protein-protein interfaces. These results are
   compatible with a highly dynamic and `` wet{''} protein-DNA interface,
   yet highly specific and tight, where individual interactions are
   constantly being formed and broken.}},

Abstract = {{The amyloid beta-protein transiently forms low and high molecular mass
   oligomers and protofibrils in vitro, and after longer incubation times
   assembles into polymorphic mature fibrils. The precursor-to-product
   relationship of these species remains to be understood. Protofibrils are
   up to similar to 600 nm in length and have mass-per-lengths of 19(+/- 2)
   kDa/nm measured by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Two
   predominant mature fibril types, several microns in length and with
   mass-per-lengths of 18(+/- 3) and 27(+/- 3)kDa/nm, are identified after
   longer incubation times. The difference of similar to 9 kDa/nm between
   the two fibril types indicates a bona fide elementary protofilament
   subunit of this mass-per-length. Fibrils in the 18(+/- 3) kDa/nm group
   often exhibited distinct coiling with axial cross-over spacings of
   similar to 25 nm. Although strikingly different in morphology, the
   mass-per-length (MPL) of these coiled fibrils is equivalent to that
   measured for protofibrils. They could therefore arise from a
   conformational change in the protofibril concurrent with coiling and
   rapid elongation. Alternatively, we cannot rule out an assembly pathway
   not directly related to protofibrils. In contrast, the 27(+/- 3) kDa/nm
   fibrils correspond to a MPL of similar to 1.5 X the protofibril and thus
   can neither arise from a simple conformational transition nor from
   lateral association of 19 kDa/nm protofibril precursors. Twisted ribbons
   with axial periodicities ranging from similar to 80 nm to 130 nm were
   prominent in the 27(+/- 3) kDa/nm group as well as more tightly coiled
   fibrils. Individual fibril ribbons had elongation rates of 20(+/- 12)
   nm/min when imaged by time-lapse atomic force microscopy. Protofibrils
   exhibited growth rates similar to 15 X slower at 1.3(+/- 0.5) nm/min.
   The data support a model where concurrent multiple assembly pathways
   give rise to the various polymorphic fibril types. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Tgs1 is the enzyme responsible for converting 7-methyl-guanosine RNA
   caps to the 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap structures of small nuclear and
   small nucleolar RNAs. Whereas budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
   fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe encode a single Tgs1 protein,
   the primitive eukaryote Giardia lamblia encodes two paralogs, Tgs1 and
   Tgs2. Here we show that purified Tgs2 is a monomeric enzyme that
   catalyzes methyl transfer from AdoMet ( Km of 6 mu M) to m(7)GDP (K-m of
   65 mu M; k(cat) of 14 min(-1)) to form m(2,7)GDP. Tgs2 also methylates
   m(7)GTP (K-m of 30 mu M; kcat of 13 min(-1)) and m(7)GpppA (K-m of 7 mu
   M;k(cat) of 14 min(-1)) but is unreactive with GDP, GTP, GpppA, ATP,
   CTP, or UTP. We find that the conserved residues Asp-68, Glu-91, and
   Trp-143 are essential for Tgs2 methyltransferase activity in vitro. The
   m2,7GDP product formed by Tgs2 can be converted tom2,2,7GDP by S. pombe
   Tgs1 in the presence of excess AdoMet. However, Giardia Tgs2 itself is
   apparently unable to add a second methyl group at guanine-N2. This
   result implies that 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine caps in Giardia are either
   synthesized by Tgs1 alone or by the sequential action of Tgs2 and Tgs1.
   The specificity of Tgs2 raises the prospect that some Giardia mRNAs
   might contain dimethylguanosine caps.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum well states are a consequence of confinement in a quantum
   cavity. In this study we investigate with photoemission the influence of
   the interface electronic structure on the quantum well state energy
   dispersion in ultrathin Mg(0001) films on W(110). Coupling between the
   sp-derived quantum well states and the substrate across the interface
   becomes manifest in a deviation from free electronlike dispersion
   behavior. Most importantly, we observe a marked level splitting, which
   is interpreted as due to the Rashba effect at the interface. Such an
   interfacial electron beam splitting on materials with strong spin-orbit
   coupling is an essential ingredient for novel spintronic devices. The
   combination of a quantum cavity with a heavy, electron reflecting
   substrate reveals spin-splitting effects in ultrathin films without
   conventional magnetism being involved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a joint replenishment problem where the product demands are

   updates the review interval and the target inventory level of every
   product at each review point based on the current inventory status and
   the past demand data. A simulation model is developed to compare the
   performance of this proposed policy with an existing periodic review
   policy. The results show that the proposed policy has consistently
   achieved significant saving in all the different experimental scenarios.

   of nucleic acid structure, which cannot be properly reproduced by
   existing force fields of molecular mechanics, is phenomenon of
   nonplanarity and flexibility of base amino groups. This phenomenon is
   described by precise quantum mechanics ab initio calculations. As a
   first step in developing force field, based on both experimental and
   accurate quantum chemistry data, the calculations of the MP2/631G(d,p)
   ab initio level of theory were performed for extended sets of amino
   group torsion angles of cytosine, one of nucleic acid bases. Dependences
   of internal base energy and base geometry parameters on three amino
   group torsions were constructed and analyzed. Construction of
   two-dimensional maps for energy and geometry parameters as functions of
   amino hydrogen torsions enables to suggest trial analytical expressions
   for additional terms responsible for amino group flexibility. Exact
   values of coefficients in the formulae for the molecule energy and amino
   group geometry parameters will be obtained after the comparison of the
   results of quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics computations for
   base-base interactions in various mutual base arrangements. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Quantum chemical calculations for H-2 dissociation on NiMoS and MoS2
   catalysts were carried out using the ab initio density functional theory
   and the pseudopotential approaches. The catalysts were modeled by
   XMo4S17H16, X = Ni, Mo cluster models. Two dissociation route, the
   heterolytic and the homolytic, were studied on the MoS2 cluster model.
   The results show that the homolytic dissociation is favored over the
   heterolytic route. On the NiMoS cluster model, the homolytic route is
   less favored thermodynamically than in the MoS2. The topological
   analysis of the electron density indicates the presence Of S-2 groups on
   the MoS2 and NiMoS surfaces, as well as a Mo-Mo bond in the MoS2 model.
   No Ni-Mo bond was found in the NiMoS cluster model. The presence of Ni
   activates the Mo-S bond, produces a polarization at this bond and
   decreases the chemical hardness of the solid. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Calcineurin (CN) is thought to play an important role in the immune
   system by regulating cytokine production, for example, interleukin-2
   (IL-2) in T-lymphocytes. We have previously shown that physiological
   concentrations of Zn2+ inhibit CN activity in vitro {[}K. Takahashi, E.
   Akaishi, Y. Abe, R. Ishikawa, S. Tanaka, K. Hosaka, Y. Kubohara, Zinc
   inhibits calcineurin activity in vitro by competing with nickel,
   Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 307 (2003) 64-68], in spite of the fact
   that Zn2+ is an essential element of the CN catalytic domain. In this
   study, in order to assess whether Zn2+ regulates (suppresses) CN
   activity in vivo and whether Zn2+ can be used as an anti-inflammatory
   and/or immuno suppressive drug, we examined the effects of Zn2+ on IL-2
   production induced by the mitogen, concanavalin A (ConA), in Jurkat
   T-cells. Zn2+ at 0.2 mM suppressed ConA-induced IL-2 accumulation in the
   medium of an in vitro culture of Jurkat cells. Zn2+ at 0.03-0.3 mM
   dose-dependently suppressed ConA-induced IL-2 mRNA expression in Jurkat
   cells. Zn2+ also suppressed IL-2 mRNA expression induced by phorbol
   ester (PMA) and ionomycin. Furthermore, Zn2+ and the immunosuppressant
   FK506 showed an additive inhibitory effect on ConA-induced IL-2 mRNA
   expression. These results suggest that exogenously added Zn2+ may
   disturb (increase) the intracellular Zn2+ concentration and inhibit CN
   activity, thereby suppressing IL-2 production in Jurkat cells. The
   present study further indicates that Zn2+ may have therapeutic potential
   in the treatment of T-cell related inflammation and also that Zn2+ may
   be utilized as a supplemental drug with FK506. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Role of NMDA receptors in the lateralized potentiation of amygdala

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{75-91}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The present study investigated the role of NMDA receptors in behavioral
   and neuroplastic changes in amygdala efferent (central amygdala to
   periaqueductal gray-ACE-PAG) and amygdala afferent (ventral angular
   bundle to basolateral amygdala-VAB-BLA) pathways in response to predator
   stress. Effects on brain and behavioral response to predator stress of
   competitive block of NMDA receptors with a dose of 10 mg/kg of CPP
   (3-(2-carboxypiperazin4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid) were studied.
   Behavioral response to stress was tested with hole board, elevated plus
   maze, light/dark box, social interaction and acoustic startle tests. CPP
   was administered i.p. 30 min prior to predator stress and blocked the
   effects of predator on some but not all behaviors measured 8 - 9 days
   later. Effects of predator stress and CPP on potentials evoked in the
   PAG by single pulse stimulation of the ACE and in the BLA by single
   pulse stimulation of VAB were assessed 10 - 11 days after predator
   stress. Predator stress potentiated ACE-PAG evoked potentials in the
   right but not the left hemisphere, replicating previous work. Predator
   stress potentiated VAB-BLA transmission in both hemispheres 10 - 11 days
   after predator stress. Right hemisphere VAB-BLA potentiation replicated
   and extended past studies showing right hemisphere potentiation at 1 and
   9 days after stress. Left VAB-BLA potentiation effects differed from the
   long term depression seen in VAB-BLA at 1 and 9 days after stress in
   previous studies. CPP blocked predator stress-induced potentiation of
   ACE-PAG and VAB-BLA evoked potentials in the right hemisphere. CPP did
   not block left VAB-BLA potentiation, rather CPP amplified it. Left
   hemisphere effects of CPP were interpreted as reflecting block of NMDA
   dependent long term depression, which unmasked a non-NMDA dependent
   potentiation. Taken together, the findings add to a body of evidence
   suggesting that a syndrome of behavioral changes follows predator
   stress. Components of this syndrome likely depend on changes in
   separable neural substrates. Potentiation of ACE-PAG and VAB-BLA evoked
   potentials in the right hemisphere likely mediates a subset of changes
   in behavior. Moreover, a medial ACE-PAG pathway is implicated in
   mediating stress-induced changes in startle amplitude. In contrast, a
   lateral ACE-PAG pathway is implicated in mediating changes in startle
   habituation. Finally, consistent with cat and human studies, the right
   hemisphere appears particularly important in long term response to
   stress. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the methodology developed to construct a model for
   predicting the behaviour of the natural radioisotopes of U, Th and Ra in
   a Mediterranean watershed. The methodology includes the development of
   the performance assessment model, obtaining water flow and radiological
   parameters based on experimental data and analysis of results. The
   model, which accounts for both water flows and mass balances of the
   radionuclides in a semi-natural environment, provides assessments of
   radionuclide behaviour in grassland and agricultural soils, rivers and
   reservoirs, including the processes of radionuclide migration through
   land and water and interactions between both. From field and laboratory
   data, it has been possible to obtain parameters for the driving
   processes considered in the model, water fluxes, source term definition,
   soil to plant transfer factors and distribution coefficient values.
   Ranges of parameter values obtained have shown good agreement with
   published literature data. This general methodological approach was
   developed to be extended to other radionuclides for the modelling of a
   biosphere watershed in the context of performance assessment of a High
   Level Waste (HLW) repository under Mediterranean climate conditions, as
   well as for forecasting radionuclide transport under similar
   Mediterranean conditions that will occur in the future in other areas.
   The application of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was intended to
   identify key uncertainties with the aim of setting priorities for future
   research. The model results for the activity concentration in the
   reservoir indicate that for U-238 and Th-230 the most relevant parameter
   is the initial concentrations of the radionuclides in the reservoir
   sediments. However, for Ra-226 the most important parameter is the
   precipitation rate over the whole watershed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All

   and Mg(II)], has been investigated by diamond-anvil cell, Raman
   microspectroscopy for pressures up to similar to 42 kbar. At similar to
   29 kbar, the v(asym) POP band of the Co(II) compound disappears
   completely and irreversibly, suggesting the occurrence of a
   pressure-driven structural transformation or possibly even the first
   stages of amorphization. No such dramatic spectral changes were observed
   for the other three metal pyrophosphates. The previously published
   crystallographic data for the unit cells of the Co(II) and Mn(II) salts
   indicate that the former is more densely packed and, therefore, more
   likely to be affected by the application of high pressures than is the
   latter, as is observed. The vibrational modes of all four compounds
   shift gradually to higher wavenumbers with increasing pressure and the
   measured pressure dependences range from 0.08 to 1.10 cm(-1) kbar(-1).

Abstract = {{We are currently conducting clinical trials of E1A gene therapy for
   patients with ovarian cancer. The adenovirus type 5 E1A gene suppresses
   growth of ovarian cancer cells that overexpress HER-2/neu (HER2) and
   growth of some-but not all-that express low HER2. In HER2-overexpressing
   cells, suppression by E1A is predominantly by down-regulation of HER2,
   but the mechanism in low HER2-expressing cells is not fully understood.
   The adenoviral E1B protein has sequential and functional homology to
   Bcl-2 and prolongs the viability of adenovirus host cells by inhibiting
   E1A-induced apoptosis. Bcl-2 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer and
   participates in chemoresistance; we hypothesized that Bcl-2 inhibits
   E1A-induced apoptosis leading to resistance to E1A gene therapy. E1A
   suppressed colony formation of ovarian cancer cells that express low
   levels of Bcl-2 and HER2 (OVCAR-3 and OVCA 433), but enhanced colony
   formation in low HER2-, high Bcl-2-expressing ovarian cancer cells (2774
   and HEY). Treating 2774 or HEY cells with antisense oligonucleotide
   Bcl-2 (Bcl-2-ASO) did not reduce cell viability. E1A combined with
   Bcl-2-ASO led to significant decreases in cell viability resulting from
   increased apoptosis relative to cells treated with E1A alone (P < 0.05).
   The increase in apoptosis was partly due to cytochrome c release and
   subsequently caspase-9 activation by Bcl-2-ASO. Finally, in an ovarian
   cancer xenograft model, treatment with Bcl-2-ASO did not prolong
   survival, but E1A plus Bcl-2-ASO did (P < 0.001). In conclusion, ovarian
   tumors overexpressing Bcl-2 may not respond well to E1A gene therapy,
   but treatment with a combination of E1A and Bcl-2-ASO may overcome this
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the
   United States, due in part to the lack of a validated and effective
   screening approach for early detection. The prevalence for methylation
   of seven and three genes was examined in DNA from sputum and plasma,
   respectively, from women at different risk for lung cancer.
   Experimental Design: Lung cancer survivors (n = 56), clinically
   cancer-free smokers (n = 121), and never smokers (n = 74) comprised the
   study population. Plasma was collected from all three groups, whereas
   sputum was collected from lung cancer survivors and smokers.
   Results: Methylation was detected in plasma DNA from 10 of 74 women who
   never smoked. Prevalence for methylation of the p16 gene in plasma was
   highest in lung cancer survivors. Lung cancer survivors showed a
   significant increase in the odds of having at least one or more genes
   methylated in plasma (odds ratio, 3.6; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.9-9.1) than never smokers. The prevalence for methylation of the
   O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, ras effector homologue 1, death
   associated protein kinase, and PAX5 alpha genes in sputum was
   significantly higher in lung cancer survivors compared with smokers.
   Lung cancer survivors had 6.2-fold greater odds (95\% confidence
   interval, 2.1-18.5) for methylation of three or more genes in sputum
   compared with smokers. Methylation was more commonly detected in sputum
   than plasma for O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase and ras effector
   homologue 1, but not p16, in lung cancer survivors.
   Conclusion: Concomitant methylation of multiple. gene promoters in
   sputum is strongly associated with lung cancer risk.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric spectroscopy was used to study the influence of layer
   thickness of confined liquid crystal (with different orientation of
   molecules at pore walls) on relaxations due to surface induced
   polarization and due to molecular reorientations. Low frequency
   measurements provided information on the relaxation of surface
   polarization that arose at the liquid crystal-pore wall interface. The
   dynamics of molecular reorientations were investigated in high frequency
   experiments. The relaxation of surface induced polarization was slower
   for confined liquid crystal with axial boundary conditions than for that
   with a radial orientation, suggesting that the mobility of molecules in
   surface layers was strongly affected by boundary conditions. The radial
   alignment of molecules facilitated the investigation of the librational
   mode. Temperature dependence of relaxation time of this mode was
   different from that of reorientations of molecules around their short
   axes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Imiquimod is currently approved for the treatment of genital
   warts and has been shown to decrease recurrences of genital herpes in
   the guinea pig model of genital herpes. Therefore, we evaluated the
   safety and potential of topical imiquimod to decrease the rate of
   recurrence in humans with a history of recurrent herpes labialis.
   Methods. Forty-seven subjects with recurrent herpes labialis applied
   imiquimod 5\% (n = 30) or vehicle cream (n = 17) to recurrent lesion(s)
   on days 1, 3, and 5 of the study (day 1 of observation occurred within
   48 h after recurrence of lesion). Subjects were seen at the study
   centers between each dose and 3 days after application of the final dose
   or until resolution of the lesion.
   Results. After application to recurrent lesions, local erythema, edema,
   scabbing and/or flaking, pain, burning, and maximal lesion size were
   significantly greater in the imiquimod group than in the vehicle group.
   The study was terminated early because of severe local adverse events
   that occurred in 5 recipients of imiquimod. The median time until the
   next recurrence was, however, increased from 50 days in the vehicle
   group to 91 days in the imiquimod group (P = .018).
   Conclusions. Application of imiquimod 5\% cream to herpes labialis
   lesions was associated with a delay in the time to the first recurrence
   after treatment, but severe local inflammation occurred in some
   individuals.}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The function and origin of NG2+ cells in the adult brain are still
   controversial. A large amount of data is available which strongly
   indicates that adult NG2-expressing cells form a heterogeneous
   population, constituted by oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and a
   fourth novel type of glial cells named the synantocytes. Whether these
   two populations derive from the progressive maturation of perinatal NG2+
   OPCs or are generated as separate populations is not known. We used
   organotypic cultures of newborn mouse cerebellum depleted, by
   anti-mitotic drug treatment, of their NG2+ cells with perinatal features
   (high proliferating rate and high oligodendrocytic differentiation
   ability). In these cultures, despite the lack of myelin after 14 days in
   vitro, numerous NG2+ cells remained. We show that these BrdU-resistant
   cells were able to slowly divide, as adult NG2+ cells do. Although many
   of these cells expressed O4, only a very small fraction of them was
   further engaged in oligodendrocyte lineage, as they had an extremely
   poor capacity to generate myelin sheaths to the Purkinje cell axons.
   These results support the view that at least two distinct populations of
   NG2+ cells coexist in the cerebellum from birth: one with the young OPC
   characteristics, another with adult NG2+ cell characteristics. Thus, a
   fraction of adult NG2+ cells do not derive from the maturation of
   perinatal OPCs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{LevelScheme is a scientific figure preparation system for Mathematica.
   The main emphasis is upon the construction of level schemes, or level
   energy diagrams, as used in nuclear, atomic, molecular, and hadronic
   physics. LevelScheme also provides a general infrastructure for the
   preparation of publication-quality figures, including support for
   multipanel and inset plotting, customizable tick mark generation, and
   various drawing and labeling tasks. Coupled with Mathematica's plotting
   functions and powerful programming language, LevelScheme provides a
   flexible system for the creation of figures combining diagrams,
   mathematical plots, and data plots.

   investigated under equibiaxial tension at a strain rate of 8.3 x 10(-4)

   size was 50nm. The experimental relative bulging height (RBH) values
   were measured, and compared with that predicted by a finite element
   method (FEM) model. It was found that the composite had exhibited good
   superplasticity, illustrating high RBH values, and the die diameter
   affected significantly its deformation behavior. The cavitation behavior
   of the composite was also examined, and found to be dependent on stress
   state and the total effective strain. As compared to the analytical
   results, the FEM predictions were shown to be in better agreement with
   the experimental thickness distribution, although a large discrepancy
   was observed for dies with small diameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The cDNAs encoding beta-subunits of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
   and luteinizing hormone (LH) have been cloned from the pituitary of
   snakehead fish, Channa maculata, and the three-dimensional structural
   models of the encoded FSH and LH were investigated. The cloned cDNAs,
   including 5'-untranslated region (UTR), open-reading frame, and 3'-UTR
   followed by a poly(A) tail, were obtained by reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA
   end methods. The open-reading frames of FSH-beta cDNA encodes a
   120-amino acid protein with a signal peptide of 18 amino acids and a
   mature protein of 102 amino acids; while LH-beta cDNA encodes a
   140-amino acid protein with a signal peptide of 33 amino acids and a
   mature protein of 115 amino acids. The amino acid sequence identities of
   snakehead fish FSH-beta and LH-beta in comparison with other fish are
   27.8-81.9\% and 45.2-88.8\%, respectively; while in comparison with
   tetrapods are 26.2-28.9\% and 37.5-51.2\%, respectively. Both FSH-beta
   and LH-beta of snakehead fish resemble most to those of Perciformes,
   implying their closer phylogenetic relationship. All 12 cysteine
   residues are conserved in snakehead fish LH-beta; while 11 cysteine
   residues are conserved in its FSH-beta. The third cysteine is absent in
   snakehead fish FSH-beta; instead, a positionally shifted cysteine
   residue is present at the N-terminus, as found in some phylogenetic
   related fish. The structure models of snakehead fish FSH and LH,
   constructed by using the crystal structures of human FSH and human
   chorionic gonadotropin as respective template, showed that the
   positionally shifted N-terminal cysteiDe residue of snakehead fish
   FSH-beta likely can substitute the third cysteine to form a disulfide
   bond with the 12th cysteine. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   programming. The objects of source-tracking are deductions in the logic
   of term unification. The semantics of deductions are paths over a
   unification graph whose labels form the suffix language of a semi-Dyck
   set. Based on this idea of unification paths, two algorithms for
   generating proofs are presented: the first uses context-free labeled
   shortest-path algorithms to generate optimal (shortest) proofs in time
   O(n(3)) for a fixed signature, where n is the number of vertices of the
   unification graph. The second algorithm integrates easily with standard
   unification algorithms, entailing an overhead of only a constant factor,
   but generates non-optimal proofs. These non-optimal proofs may be
   further simplified by group rewrite rules. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The chi theory of adsorption has been modified to yield the absolute
   value for the surface area. The modifications include the utilization of
   the van der Waal radius and the concept of allowing an adsorbate
   molecule to either roll-over or -under other adsorbate molecules. This
   yields the hard sphere model for adsorption. The hard sphere model is
   further modified by using a Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential and a energy
   averaging to obtain a closer approximation to the per molecule excluded
   area. The equation which yields the absolute value for the surface area
   for a flat homogeneous surface is given by: A(s) = fnA(m)/Delta chi
   Delta chi where f has a value between 1.83 and 1.93. The value off
   depends upon the relative sizes of the adsorbent atoms or ions and the
   adsorbate molecules. Using this modification, an analysis of MCM-41 data
   by Qiao, Bhatia and Zhao was performed to yield the pore diameters by
   two methods. These methods were to calculate the pore diameters from (1)
   the surface areas and pore volumes determined and (2) the Kelvin
   equation for capillary filling with the starting film thickness also
   modified also by the factor f. The latter method yields the pore size
   distribution as also. Both methods yielded excellent result consistent
   with a pore wall thickness in the range of 0.50-0.90 nm. An additional
   conclusion of the calculation was that most of the hysteresis effect is
   attributed to a change in the adsorption energy between adsorption and
   desorption. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The kilogram is the unit of mass in the International System. Its
   definition dates from 1889 and, therefore, predates most of modern
   physics. The definition simply states that the `kilogram' is the mass of
   an object known as the international prototype. Thus, we have the
   extraordinary situation that certain fundamental physical constants (the
   Planck constant, the Newtonian constant of gravitation, the mass of an
   electron, the mass of an atom of carbon-12, etc.) are measured in terms
   of an artefact that was manufactured in the nineteenth century. We begin
   by describing what is presently known about the long-term stability of
   artefact standards axid how this stability can be experimentally
   monitored with respect to fundamental constants of physics. Finally, we
   suggest that present experiments are close to achieving the target
   uncertainty of the order 10(-8), although the current incoherence
   between two classes of experiments is cause for concern.}},

   Semen was successfully recovered by electroejaculation from 107 of 115
   wild flying foxes (Pteropus alecto, Pteropus poliocephalus and Pteropus
   scapulatus). A proportion of ejaculates collected from all three species
   contained seminal vesicle secretions, the incidence of which appeared
   related to breeding season. Ejaculate volume was small (5-160 mu L),
   requiring a specialised collection vessel and immediate extension to
   avoid desiccation. Sperm morphological abnormalities and characteristics
   are described for the first time. In two species (P. scapulatus and P.
   alecto), sperm quality varied with breeding season. Dilution in
   Tris-citratefructose buffer and subsequent incubation (37 degrees C) of
   Pteropus semen for 2-3 h appeared to have a negative impact on sperm
   motility and the percentage of sperm with intact plasma membranes and
   acrosomes and represents a concern for the potential development and use
   of assisted breeding technology in these species. Preliminary attempts
   to develop a short-term chilled preservation protocol for flying fox
   semen revealed that spenn viability (percentage motility and percentage
   live sperm with intact acrosomes) was significantly reduced after 102 h
   chilled storage at 5 degrees C; nevertheless, approximately 40\% of the
   spermatozoa were still motile and contained intact acrosomes. Glycerol
   was neither protective nor detrimental to sperm survival during chilled
   storage. Microbial flora of the prepuce, urethra and semen of all
   species were isolated and their antibiotic susceptibility tested.
   Tetracycline, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime were the most
   effective antibiotics in preventing growth of all identified bacteria;
   however, their effects on sperm survival were not investigated. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Background: Autogenous bone grafting is considered the standard in
   management of bony defects but has some disadvantages, including limited
   source of graft material, especially in children. This study represents
   an attempt to regenerate bone at the donor site of iliac bone grafts
   using the guided bone regeneration principle for future use in
   multistage bone reconstruction by grafting.
   Methods: Critical size defects were created in 24 iliac bones of 12
   skeletally mature New Zealand White rabbits. Defects in group 1 (n = 12)
   were covered with inverted U-shaped resorbable mesh (space maintainer)
   and polytetrafluoroethylene membranes underneath the periosteum. In
   group 2 (n = 6), inverted U-shaped resorbable mesh was used alone
   (positive control). In group 3 (n = 6), neither resorbable mesh nor
   polytetrafluoroethylene membranes were used (negative control). An
   impaired t test was used for comparison between each two groups.
   Results: Plain radiographs and contact microradiographic studies showed
   that bone regeneration was significantly higher in group I and group 2
   than in group 3 (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between
   group 1 and group 2 regarding density.
   Conclusions: The periosteum acted as an ideal membrane for guided bone
   regeneration so that the polytetrafluoroethylene membranes could be used
   only to compensate for the deficient periosteum. Space maintenance was
   essential for bone regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Ischemia reperfusion injury leading to acute renal failure
   (ARF) and delayed graft function is an important problem in organ
   transplantation. CD4+ T cells, essential for transplant rejection, may
   mediate ischemic ARE We have demonstrated that the caspase-1 mediated
   production of IL-18 is pathogenic in ischemic ARF in mice. A potential
   source of IL-18 in ischemic ART is the CD4+ T cell. We therefore
   examined the effect CD4+ T cell depletion on the development of ischemic
   ARF and the activation of IL-18.
   Methods. Functional and histological correlates were examined in two
   groups of mice with ischemic ARF: 1) CD4 T-cell depleted with the
   antibody GK1.5, and 2) T-cell receptor a-chain deficient (TCR alpha -/-)
   mice. TCRa -/- mice lack the a chain of the T-cell receptor and
   therefore lack functional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
   Results. Flow cytometry of lymph nodes and immunohistochemistry of
   kidneys demonstrated complete depletion of CD4+ T cells in mice with
   ischemic ARF treated with GK1.5. CD4+ T-cell depletion did not confer
   functional (serum creatinine, BUN and FITC-labeled inulin clearance) or
   histological protection against ischemic ARE Likewise, TCRa -/- mice
   were not protected against ischemic ARF. Renal caspase-1 activity and
   IL-18 protein were similar in CD4+ T-cell depleted and wild-type
   postischemic reperfusion.
   Conclusions. Ischemic ARF can occur in the absence of classical T-cell
   function. The evaluation of other inflammatory mediators (e.g.,
   macrophages or NK cells) as a source of IL-18 and mediator of ischemic
   ARF warrants further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{A miniaturized Mossbauer spectrometer, adapted to the Earth's conditions
   from the instrument developed for Mars space missions, has been used for
   the first time to study in situ variations with depth and
   transformations with time of iron minerals in a gleysol. The instrument
   is set into a PVC tube and can be moved up and down precisely (1 mm) at
   the desired depth. Mossbauer spectra were obtained from 15 to 106 cm
   depth and repeated exactly at the same point at different times to
   follow mineralogical transformations with time. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   and selective extraction techniques were performed on soil samples. The
   piezometric level of the water table was measured and the composition of
   the soil solution was monitored in situ and continuously, with a
   multiparametric and automatic probe. All the Mossbauer spectra obtained
   are characteristic of Fe(II)-Fe(III) green rust-fougerite, a natural
   mineral of the meixnerite group, that is, whose structural formula is:
   {[}Fe-1-x(II) Mg-y Fe-x(III) (OH)(2+2y)](x+) {[}xA, mH(2)O](x-), where x
   is the ratio Fe3+/Fe-tot. and A the intercalated anion. The name of
   fougerite has been formally approved by the Commission on New Minerals
   and Mineral Names of IMA (number 2003-057), on January 29, 2004. No
   other iron phases have been found by this way or by XRD. About 90\% of
   total iron is extractible by dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate, and 60\% by
   citratebicarbonate. In the horizons showing oximorphic properties that
   are in the upper part of the studied soil profile, x ratio in fougerite,
   deduced from Mossbauer spectra, is approximately 2/3. In the deepest
   horizons that show reductomorphic properties, x ratio is only 1/3. Fast
   mineralogical transformations were observed at well-defined points in
   soil, as evidenced by x ratio variations observed when Mossbauer spectra
   were acquired at different times at the same depth. Variations of the
   level of the water table and of pe and pH of the soil solution were
   simultaneously observed and could explain these mineralogical
   transformations. A ternary solid solution model previously proposed for
   OH-fougerite has been extended to chloride, sulphate, and carbonate
   green rusts to estimate the Gibbs free energies of formation of
   fougerite, providing for possible anions other than OH- in the
   interlayer and for Mg substitution. Soil solutions appear as largely
   oversaturated with respect to OH-fougerite, either oversaturated or
   undersaturated to ``carbonate-fougerite{''} and
   ``sulphate-fougerite{''}, and largely undersaturated with respect to
   ``chloro-fougerite{''}. Fougerite forms most likely from oversaturated
   solutions by coprecipitation of Fe3+ with Fe2+ and Mg2+. Oxidation and
   reduction are driven by pH and pe variations, with both long timescale
   variations and short duration events. Exactly as synthetic green rusts
   are very reactive compounds in the laboratory, fougerite is thus a very
   reactive mineral and readily forms, dissolves, or evolves in soils.

Abstract = {{The mammalian chloride channel ClC-2 is a member of the CLC
   voltage-gated chloride channels family. This broadly expressed protein
   shows diverse cellular locations and despite numerous studies, its
   precise function is poorly understood. Disruption of ClC-2-encoding gene
   in mouse leads to retinal and testicular degeneration and mutations in
   CLC2 (gene encoding the ClC-2 channel) are associated with idiopathic
   generalized epilepsies. ClC-2 may also be responsible for Cl- transport

   presence of such proteins in yeast could indicate the existence of their
   homologues in mammalian cells and would greatly aid their
   identification. Expression of CIC-2 in yeast required optimization of
   the sequence context of the AUG translation initiation codon. After
   obtaining an efficient translation, we found that rat CIC-2 cannot
   directly substitute for yeast Gef1p. Functional substitution for Gef1p
   was, however, achieved in the presence of an increased level of intact
   or C-terminally truncated yeast Kha1 protein. Based on the deduced amino
   acid sequence, the Kha1 protein can be classified as a Na+/H+
   transporter since it has a large N-terminal domain similar to the family
   of NHEs (Na+/H+ exchangers). This suggests that the Kha1 p may take part
   in the regulation of intracellular cation homoeostasis and pH control.
   We have established that Kha(1)p is localized in the same cellular
   compartment as Gef1p and yeast-expressed CIC-2: the Golgi apparatus. We
   propose that Kha1p may aid ClC-2-dependent suppression of the Delta
   gef1-assocciated growth defects by keeping the Golgi apparatus pH in a
   range suitable for CIC-2 activity. The approach employed in the present
   study may be of general applicability to the characterization of poorly
   understood proteins by their functional expression in yeast.}},

Abstract = {{Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays a key role in the
   determination of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels via its action on
   intravascular HDL metabolism. The TaqIB polymorphism of the CETP gene is
   associated with plasma CETP and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   (HDL-C) levels and with premature coronary artery disease. Such
   associations appear to result from linkage disequilibrium between TaqIB
   and other functional polymorphisms. To date, only one functional
   promoter variant, which may explain the effects of TaqIB, has been
   identified at position -629 in the CETP gene. Here we describe a C/T
   polymorphism located at position -1337 in the human CETP gene (C allele
   frequency: 0.684), which is significantly associated with plasma HDL-C
   and CETP levels (P=0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Transient
   transfection of a reporter gene construct containing the CETP promoter
   from -1707/+28 in liver cells (HepG2) revealed that the -1337T allele
   was expressed to a significantly lower degree (-34\%, P < 0.0001) than
   the -1337C allele. In addition, we clearly demonstrated that the -971G/A
   polymorphism is functional and that its functionality is intimately
   linked to the presence of the -1337 site. In vitro evaluation of
   potential interaction between -1337C/T and other functional variants of
   the CETP gene (-971G/A and -629C/A) demonstrated that these three
   functional CETP promoter polymorphisms can interact together to
   determine the overall activity of the CETP gene and thus contribute
   significantly to variation in plasma CETP mass concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Two 3-(5-tetrazolylmethoxy) analogues, 1a and 1b, of
   (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (AMPA), a
   selective AMPA receptor agonist, and
   (RS)-2-amino-3-(5-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid
   (ATPA), a GluR5-preferring agonist, were synthesized. Compounds 1a and
   1b were pharmacologically characterized in receptor binding assays, and
   electrophysiologically on homomeric AMPA receptors (GluR1-4), homomeric
   (GluR5 and GluR6) and heteromeric (GluR6/KA2) kainic acid receptors,
   using two-electrode voltage-clamped Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing
   these receptors. Both analogues proved to be antagonists at all AMPA
   receptor subtypes, showing potencies (K-b = 38-161 mu M) similar to that
   of the AMPA receptor antagonist
   (RS)-2-amino-3-{[}3-(carboxymethoxy)-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl]propionic
   acid (AMOA) (Kb = 4376 mu M). Furthermore, the AMOA analogue, la,
   blocked two kainic acid receptor subtypes (GluR5 and GluR6/KA2), showing
   sevenfold preference for GluR6/KA2 (Kb = 19 mu M). Unlike the iGluR
   antagonist
   (S)-2-amino-3-{[}5-tert-butyl-3-(phosphonomethoxy)-4-isoxazolyl]propioni
   c acid {[}(S)-ATPO], the corresponding tetrazolyl analogue, 1b, lacks
   kainic acid receptor effects. On the basis of docking to a crystal
   structure of the isolated extracellular ligand-binding core of the AMPA
   receptor subunit GluR2 and a homology model of the kainic acid receptor
   subunit GluR5, we were able to rationalize the observed
   structure-activity relationships. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
